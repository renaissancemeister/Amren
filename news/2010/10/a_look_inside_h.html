			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gini Sikes, Essence, October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s June, two months after the Cumberland River flash floods tore through Nashville, and the local hotels still feel like ghost towns. The Grand Ole Opry and equally famous Gaylord Opryland Hotel, damaged during the punishing storms, remain closed. The Radisson, however, is high and dry, housing 100-odd guests from Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, the Carolinas and elsewhere. At first glance this all-White gathering could be for a trade show or the Rotary Club. They&rsquo;re average folks: retired lawyers and professors, ministers, housewives, business managers. Any of them could be your neighbor, until you take a closer listen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all come here for the 2010 convention of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), a White Nationalist nonprofit opposed to race mixing, non-European immigration and hate crime legislation. The organizers kept the conference location fiercely secret from the media, mainly because months earlier keynote speaker Jared Taylor was forced to cancel a program on the &#8220;dangers of diversity&#8221; after antiracists pressured four D.C.-area hotels. Today, a who&rsquo;s who of White Pride luminaries mingles among a crowd of Neo-Confederates, Separatists, Patriots, Constitutionalists and even an elderly woman in a sweatshirt that reads, SECEDE. As a White journalist hired by ESSENCE to tell this story, I&rsquo;m able to mingle with them. I discovered they have widely varying agendas, but two things clearly unite the majority: unyielding loyalty to their race and a hatred for President Obama.</p>
<p>In his keynote Taylor, who believes Whites on average are genetically smarter than Blacks, rails against multiculturalism. He reserves special ire for Hispanic immigrants, rhetorically asking, &#8220;Are you telling me the country my ancestors built was a dung heap until you lot showed up?&#8221; Taylor calls himself a &#8220;race realist,&#8221; someone who prefers the company of his own race, to the point of separatism. &#8220;We deplore everything leading to the eventual obliteration of our people,&#8221; he says. &#8220;When we talk about taking the country back, the America we want to &#8216;take back&rsquo; is from the 1950&rsquo;s, when Whites were 90 percent of the population, and no one dreamed we would become a minority in fewer than 100 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the outcry of the fringe radical Right. It&rsquo;s shouted at private conventions and meetings and spread via the Web. {snip} Anxiety about race continues to plague many Americans, as evidenced by vitriolic town hall meetings where once hidden bigotry is now publicly expressed. So what&rsquo;s changed?</p>
<p>Since President Obama took office, pundits, politicians and protestors have vilified him as an &#8220;other,&#8221; a foreigner, Muslim, Commie, Hitler, Islamic terrorist, witch doctor, monkey and even &#8220;a racist,&#8221; as Fox News host Glenn Beck so infamously declared and later retracted. Even though President George W. Bush was also disparaged, whoever inherited 2008&rsquo;s eviscerated economy and terrifying levels of unemployment was bound to suffer blame. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism is part of the United States of America,&#8221; says Leonard Zeskind, an expert on White Nationalism and president of the Institute for Research &amp; Education on Human Rights, which recently released the most extensive study thus far of the evolution of the national Tea Party movement, which racist groups are trying to infiltrate. {snip}</p>
<p>The new, soft-pedaled tactic of the fringe is particularly insidious. It allows members to blend in with more mainstream groups, like the Tea Party, which is angling to play a key role in the midterm elections and beyond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>NO SKINHEADS ALLOWED</p>
<p>At the CofCC convention, speaker after speaker hammers the triumphs of the White race. They sound nothing like the stereotypical tattooed skinheads or white-hooded malcontents of traditional hate groups. {snip}</p>
<p>Another speaker, Louis March, who was once an aide to the late conservative Senator Jesse Helms, encourages Whites to procreate to secure a White-centric world. &#8220;Mainstream middle America Whites are catching up to you and I,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The prospects for winning Whites to whiteness have never been greater!&#8221;</p>
<p>By focusing on White alienation, White power advocates hope to mobilize supporters and win recruits, eventually resulting in electoral success. True believers spread the word on Facebook and Twitter, the same social networks that helped put President Obama in office. Don Black, a former Klan wizard, is deemed the first to recognize the Internet&rsquo;s potential to spread his message. {snip} In 1996 he quit the Klan and launched stormfront.org, the Web&rsquo;s most active White Nationalist site.</p>
<p>Along with gun talk (why are non-Whites allowed to own them) and photos of White women earmarked as Aryan beauties, Stormfront forums also offer strategies on how to successfully crash the Tea Party movement. Don&rsquo;t hand out KKK flyers, cautions one post, comparing the seduction to a drug dealer trying to persuade high school kids to try heroin. &#8220;Better to use a gateway drug,&#8221; the post suggests, like providing an address of a &#8220;race-conscious&#8221; site to pull them in slowly.</p>
<p>The KKK  &mdash;  {snip}  &mdash;  while losing both relevance and supporters over the years, now mostly consists of law-abiding, family-oriented folks, or so says Pendergraft. The modern-day Klan suggests that hiding beneath bed sheets is pass√©, despite a noticeable emphasis on anonymity in The Crusader, the Knights&rsquo; newspaper. {snip}</p>
<p>These new efforts are have the potential to make inroads with average Americans, Tea Party members included. A 2010 poll by the University of Washington Institute for the Study of Ethnicity, Race and Sexuality found that, compared with non-members, Tea Party supporters were 25 percent more likely to be &#8220;racially resentful&#8221; and less likely to believe African-Americans are intelligent, hardworking or trustworthy.</p>
<p>RINO HUNTING DOWN SOUTH</p>
<p>On a warm Friday night in Greenville, South Carolina, the parking lot of a supersize Denny&rsquo;s is jam-packed. Inside the dining area is empty, but in a large back room, a group known as RINO Hunt  &mdash;  &#8220;Republican In Name Only&#8221;  &mdash;  is planning an ultraconservative sectarian battle. Befitting the group&rsquo;s &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; political mind-set, its founder, Harry Kibler, a 43-year-old fitness club corporate manager, drives a pickup with a toilet bolted on back. A mannequin stuck headfirst in the commode indicates the impending fate of Republicans who don&rsquo;t march in step with the GOP platform. {snip}</p>
<p>At this meeting, snowy-haired RINO Hunt members are listening in on a side conversation with Roan Garcia-Quintana, a political consultant who served in the Reagan administration and helped organize a Tea Party event in Greenville. Garcia-Quintana calls himself &#8220;a Confederate-Cuban, born in Havana, raised in Savannah,&#8221; and emphasizes his parents&rsquo; apparent direct lineage to Spain. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>HOPE TURNS TO HATE</p>
<p>Gracie Floyd knows more than she cares to about collateral damage. Floyd is the sole African-American sitting on the county council in Anderson, South Carolina, where WAIM radio talk-show host Rick Driver greets listeners with sentiments like, &#8220;Hate is an emotion, not a crime, folks.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>She worries that radical venom like this becomes legitimized when it isn&rsquo;t condemned. Although Anderson&rsquo;s mayor is Black, she believes a lot of good people are afraid to run for public office. {snip}</p>
<p>By fostering fear and hate in people for the sake of bringing down a Black president, Wingnuts author Avlon warns, &#8220;We are giving cover, sometimes a sense of purpose, to the crazy among us.&#8221; His point is, no one can predict what might prompt an unhinged soul to act out. And yet GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann expressed that America is turning into &#8220;a nation of slaves,&#8221; while Sarah Palin told a beleaguered Dr. Laura Schlessinger (who shot a volley of the N-word on her radio show in August; and resigned soon after), &#8220;Don&rsquo;t retreat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reload!&#8221; Might this rhetoric be looked upon as a trigger? What&rsquo;s to stop someone like, say, White supremacist James W. von Brunn  &mdash;  who killed an African-American security guard in a shoot-out at the Holocaust Memorial last year  &mdash;  from taking these words literally?</p>
<p>Most members of the CofCC and like-minded groups claim not to &#8220;hate&#8221; anyone. They don&rsquo;t mind if non-Whites celebrate their own race  &mdash;  as long as they do it somewhere else, preferably in another country. The chairman of the Indiana CofCC chapter, Matt Parrott, a 28-year-old business analyst, envisions dividing the United States proportionately, {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For now, White separatists may be too marginalized to make good on this threat, {snip}.</p>
<p>Still, to ignore them or their agenda is risky and may allow localized racism to metastasize into a more perilous, widespread disease. {snip}</p>
<p>Ours is a nation in transition, and change has always provoked ugly resistance. {snip}</p>

<p><i>As a White journalist hired by ESSENCE to tell this story, I&rsquo;m able to mingle with them.</i></p>
<p>In other words, a &#8216;race traitor&rsquo; and proud.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;At the CofCC convention, speaker after speaker hammers the triumphs of the White race. They sound nothing like the stereotypical tattooed skinheads or white-hooded malcontents of traditional hate groups.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wonder where this woman gets her ideas of what &#8216;racists&rsquo; are actually like? From novels? From movies? From the SPLC?</p>
<p>Of course these people sound nothing like their stereotype because they aren&rsquo;t the stereotype propagandists make them out to be. Reading between the lines, I get the feeling this author is very much surprised this group isn&rsquo;t composed of ignorant, in-bred, hood-wearing buffoons. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Tea Party supporters were 25 percent more likely to be &ldquo;racially resentful&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Were blacks questioned about their racial resentment? They likely register 95% on the racial resentment scale.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ours is a nation in transition, and change has always provoked ugly resistance&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The author admits THE fact; America IS being transformed. The questions are who wants and approves of this transformation and why isn&rsquo;t speaking out against this transformation a valid part of the national debate? Do I have any right to resist my own genocide?</p>

		<p>Lets see..Liberals control the Teachers unions. Liberals control Academia, every child from age 4-25 is brainwashed by leftist history and values, the newspapers are lockstep in their presentation of liberal piety, the networks are Leftist, popular culture from Hollywood down to to every wannabe rock star is over run by mindless<br>
overgrown children chanting leftist slogans, Big Labour is a bloc vote for the left, the country is trillions in debt due to leftist programs, our cities are reduced to wastelands inhabited by feral tribes nurturing hate against the productive classes that feed and house millions of permanent welfare recipients..BUT..BUT..the real enemy in this country is (wait for it) the K.

		<p>So whats the problem here? If whites want to preserve their<br>
own culture and live apart..why is this an issue? If they<br>
are so backward as to believe Western Civilization is superior why cant the blacks and Third Worlders<br>
let the whites go? Its not like blacks have any interest<br>
in white culture..so why not separate? Let us take our <br>
art, and music and science and political organizations..and<br>
be gone. Blacks should be celebrating their freedom..not<br>
cursing whites for their &#8220;negative attitude&#8221;. What is the <br>
problem?</p>

		<p>This street hustler on the one hand dismisses white nationalism and pride as a minimal movement; on the other he infers it could like a cancer spread and threaten, well, I guess black nationalism and supremacy. </p>
<p>He also is clueless that Jared Taylor&rsquo;s remarks are probably shared by the majority of US whites, and indeed by Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese and even some blacks honest enough to admit their culture has blown it. </p>
<p>So Mr. Essence quotes Taylor, because like most or all progressives and diversity fanatics he can&rsquo;t believe that anyone who would hear Taylor&rsquo;s narrative would not puke.We&rsquo;ll see where the vomit lands. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a belief that Whites are on average smarter than Blacks, with much of this difference due to genes.  It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>

		<p>Non-Whites are so hypocritical, they don&rsquo;t hesitate to advocate for their race, vote for politicians of their race but if Whites do the same, they&rsquo;re racist. Why should Whites want to become a minority in the country they founded? Would Mexicans or Nigerians want to become a minority in the countries they founded?</p>

		<p>#6 kc above is &#8220;right on&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the probability is that it is too late for the whites to ever gain control again.</p>
<p>All this conversation about reasons and situations and what&rsquo;s going to happen in the future is nice,</p>
<p>but the bottom line is that whites just will not think white.  Instead they think what&rsquo;s &#8220;fair&#8221; due to brainwashing over the years.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a very slim chance that if a &#8220;white party&#8221; becomes a reality, or if whites start thinking and saying &#8220;I&rsquo;m white and I&rsquo;m superior&#8221; and &#8220;whites unite&#8221; we can turn things around, but then you get called a racist and people would rather die than be called a racist.  So, get used to calling ourselves a new word - minority.  And get used to thinking a new term -<br>
&#8220;widespread white poverty&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself.  </p>

<p>So stating facts is a problem now?  Oh wait, it always was.  Perhaps rather than spewing insults at Mr. Taylor, this &#8220;journalist&#8221; could refute some of his claims.  I won&rsquo;t wait for that to happen though.</p>
<p>Comment #4 by Feller was bang on - It is clear that the people who oppose the protection of rights of White people are taking a defensive posture.  Yet at the same time they want to make it look like anyone who holds these views are part of some fringe minority.  In reality, in private conversations, almost every White person I know admits to having these views.  How long until this reality becomes the perception?</p>

- Gini Sikes, Essence, October 25, 2010<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
During the 1950&rsquo;s the top tax rate never declined below 91%.  One third of the workforce was in labor unions.  Most blue collar workers could support a wife who stayed home with the kids. The crime rate was quite a bit lower than it has been since.  Most children lived with both biological parents who were married.   </p>

		<p>For those AR readers who have studied the ravings of the Frankfurt School Cultural Marxists, it becomes transparently obvious that this Gini Sikes has been seriously infected and indoctrinated with that poisonous ideology.   </p>
<p>A recap:   The stated, documented, often repeated goal of these Frankfurt School Cultural Marxists was to &#8216;pathologize&rsquo; any expression of white ethnic pride, and to promote the insane notion that any expressed concern for their group survival by whites, and any expressed desire on the part of whites to avoid being reduced to a subjugated minority inside the White Western nations that were created by the talents, intellect and substantially higher productivity of their race - all these things were to be labeled as &#8216;a form of mental insanity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The entire derogatory, contemptuous tone of this article by Gini Sikes reflects that Frankfurt school toxic ideology perfectly.  She evidently believes that the only &#8216;proper&rsquo; and &#8216;appropriate&rsquo; response that whites are permitted - to what is clearly a race war that is being waged against them, and which has their total destruction and eventual genocide as it&rsquo;s primary objective - is to surrender, to roll over, to do nothing and accept the death sentence that their mortal enemies have planned for them.  </p>
<p>Footnote for my fellow AR readers:  In the future &#8216;new America&rsquo;, which will result from the breakup of this current decomposing dung heap, where an exclusively white ethno-state will be established - there will need to be strict laws that prohibit the sort of subversive, anti-white poison that these Frankfurt School bigots have spread into our society for the last 50 or more years.  These people are clearly spreading a message that spells white genocide and white subjugation, and this cannot be allowed to start all over again, in the new White homeland.</p>
<p>As Bob Whitaker has correctly stated:   &#8216;Anti-racist&rsquo; really means anti-white.  </p>

		<p>Since most people of all ethnicities are in truth racists, the idea of them &#8220;infiltrating&#8221; the Tea Party is ridiculous on its face.  Apparently, the left has decided that it&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s errand to attempt to paint the average white, Hispanic, Asian, and even black people of the movement as race-haters, so liberals are tossing out the theory that skinheads and Nazis are sneaking in as agents provocateur.  <br>
The more the Tea Party is labeled &#8220;racist&#8221;, the more whites will likely be drawn to it.  Most whites are sick and tired of Affirmative Action and Obama&rsquo;s radical policies.  American blacks are fully free to work for their own political platforms without the assistance of whites, though no one would know this from the actions of most of them.  Mostly, we hear &#8220;Do something!&#8221; wailed at whites whenever some word or action displeases a black.  We have a black President, but his fellow ethnics give him a pass.  White Democratic power brokers are willing to mow under black Senate candidate Kendrick Meek in hopes that white turncoat Charlie Crist can beat Tea Party Republican Marco Rubio in Florida.  And the NYT insists that blacks are now turning to Crist because they fear Meek can&rsquo;t win and that the fearsome forces of the far right will be released upon Rubio&rsquo;s win!!  Righhhhht!  The left is ready to fall right off that ragged-edged cliff they&rsquo;re perched on!</p>

		<p>Americans, especially white Americans, were blatantly lied to in 1965 when the immigration law was changed. </p>
<p>I was reading around six newspapers each day then; I scanned the editorials and columns carefully, and with the exceptions of James J. Kilpatrick and a columnist named Wilson (?), every commentator and Congressman assured the public that the ethnic and racial balance in the U.S. would not be upset. </p>
<p>The racial transformation of America has occurred without a vote and with almost no opposition, even when it became apparent what was happending. </p>
<p>Several years ago I called the office of Senator Ted Kennedy in Washington, D.C. and asked if he had ever apologized for lying to the American people when he guided the new immigration law through Congress.  The man who answered the phone said it didn&rsquo;t make any difference; race doesn&rsquo;t matter and no one complains.</p>
<p>Any race or group has the right to defend itself against attack and that is all whites are doing.  The motives of those who impugn the intentions of militant whites should be investigated.  It should be pointed out that they benefit from the downfall of white America.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been following that Meek/Crist/Clinton/Obama three ring circus in Florida.  Everybody just plain assumed that Meek voters would all automatically fall lock step behind Crist if Meek would have taken the deal.  The problem with that assumption is that most of Meek&rsquo;s voters were either black Americans or immigrant blacks.  Can you imagine them getting behind a person who is (1) white, and (2) technically still an elected Republican Governor, as I write these words?  While Crist hearts the NAACP big time, white and Republican are two big strikes against him the eyes of black voters.</p>
<p>Gloria Borger of CNN seems to be the only one who got it.  In fact, she got it so much that she said that if Meek would have dropped out, it would have created black apathy, and they would have stayed home, and this would have affected everything downballot in Florida - including Governor.  Borger thinks that Alex Sink is the person most grateful for Meek not taking the deal.</p>
<p>As for me, Marco Rubio shot his wad with me when he came out against SB 1070.  For me, none of the above.</p>

<p>Thats right Gini, you&rsquo;re one of those &#8220;good&#8221; White folks. When the time comes I&rsquo;m sure your friends at Essence will give you the Amy Biehl award you&rsquo;re so deserving of. Tell me Gini, how many White people - excluding diversity loving Whites -  are ever highlighted in Essence magazine, isn&rsquo;t the very &#8220;essence&#8221; of Essence magazine to highlight just blacks and their concerns? And why aren&rsquo;t black journalists &#8220;mingling&#8221; among blacks at NAACP meetings and reporting on the racists among them? Now THAT would be an interesting read.</p>
<p>I discovered they have widely varying agendas, but two things clearly unite the majority: unyielding loyalty to their race and a hatred for President Obama.</p>
<p>Yes just like the majority of blacks have an unyielding loyalty to their race and a love for Obama. Why wasn&rsquo;t that also the focus of your journalistic skills Gini? Show me any other race that allows another race to come in and take over their country. Take a long vacation to S. Africa\Zimbabwe Jini if you really want to see a people with an unyielding loyalty to their race.   </p>

		<p>Yes, out of the tens of thousands, if not even of the millions of &#8216;victims&rsquo; of political correctness, they finally found one who was wrongly chastised or driven from their job: Shirley Sherrod the Government employee who spoke at the NAACP meeting. And they actually apologized to her. </p>
<p>Then the article changes to a reminder that sensitive people should do more prevent bigotry and extremism - lest it spread and grow. I guess as long as you aren&rsquo;t Shirley Sherrod; as long as you aren&rsquo;t black, that&rsquo;s the proper action. But no bias here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad article, actually. However if the author thinks that white Americans or racists or the far right are only upset about Obama the author is sorely mistaken and perhaps needs to re-evaluate the subject. That may be the republican line right now&hellip; but personally I was pretty angry before I&rsquo;d ever heard of Barack Obama and I&rsquo;d still be angry without him.   </p>

If whites were locked up at the rate of blacks, the biggest state in the union would be San Quentin.40% of all black men do not get a steady job before age 25. By then they average two children from different unmarried mothers. 33% of all black women have been arrested for shop lifting by age 21. In urban areas half of all black drivers have no insurance. A majority may not be dim witted lazy crooks but they are very expensive.The average African American never pays mote than 10% in federal income tax with a significant minority paying zero.It costs white Americans about 10,000 per black person to feed them, cure them,and jail them.

She says in the article she is a white woman, by I definitely detected an Asian racial background, so I don&rsquo;t think she could be counted as a brainwashed white woman, but rather a racially mixed woman who has been watered down enough to be able to mix in with a white society that generally is not too up on their ability to spot subtle racial characteristics.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, no right winger fired Sherrod.  It was her leftist supervisors at Ag.  The NAACP has enough sway with this White House to have provided Obama and Tom Vilsack with the right &#8220;context&#8221; to nip it in the bud.  So why didn&rsquo;t they?

<p>&#8220;She evidently believes that the only &lsquo;proper&rsquo; and &lsquo;appropriate&rsquo; response that whites are permitted - to what is clearly a race war that is being waged against them, and which has their total destruction and eventual genocide as it&rsquo;s primary objective - is to surrender, to roll over, to do nothing and accept the death sentence that their mortal enemies have planned for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shelby Steele&rsquo;s point of view is of course different, but his analysis, perhaps inadvertently, goes a long way toward explaining how this happened. He contrasts the moral authority obviously felt by his white high school teacher when she dealt with him, before the race picture shifted in the U.S. in the 60s, with the limp, wilted, ashamed lack of authority exhibited by his college president a few years later, after whites in this country had been shamed over &#8220;racism,&#8221;  when he marched into the president&rsquo;s office at the head of a group of black students to present their demands. Steele follows that account with this analysis:</p>
<p>&#8220;But when white supremacy was delegitimized, whites did not simply lose the authority to practice racism. The loss of authority generalized well beyond that, so that whites also lost a degree of their authority to stand proudly for the values and ideas that had made the west a great civilization despite its many evils.<br>
&hellip;</p>
<p>The loss of moral authority went too far the other way, not only denying legitimacy to the plunder of the nonwhite world but also denying it to that entire set of difficult &#8216;character&rsquo; principles that bring coherence and even greatness to free societies: personal responsibility, hard work, individual initiative, delayed gratification, commitment to excellence, competition by merit, the honor in achievement, and so on. How could these principles be important when they had coexisted so easily with racism? Weren&rsquo;t they, in fact, a part of the machinery of white supremacy?</p>
<p>In the age of racism, blacks were held accountable to these values and principles even though they were also openly oppressed. Therefore, there was a cultural coherence in America based on these values and principles that applied to EVERYBODY (italics) despite the presence of segregation. This coherence, in itself, was a good thing, and was surely responsible for much that was great in the character of white and black Americans. Moreover, it might have provided an ideal consensus of values out of which to build a post-white supremacy society. But the delegitimization of white supremacy greatly injured this cultural coherence by taking authority away from the values and principles it was based on. After America admitted to what was worst about itself, there was not enough authority left to support what was best.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Among his other failings, Steele, possibly not willing to wander too far outside of the new ruling ethos that he relentlessly castigates, uses language that seems to imply that the white race stands out from among the other races of the world in having exerted its power in the world in unpleasant ways. This maddening lack of historical knowledge and perspective that I encounter in almost every person I try to talk to about race drives me nuttier than just about anything. I make jokes about blacks gathering on MLK Jr. day to express gratitude to the white race for being the race that outlawed slavery, and for being the race which developed the ideas of personal freedom that made the outlawing of slavery conceivable. Nada. Blank faces, blank minds).</p>

<p>I used to moan and whine about lawyers writing verbose and long documents   &mdash;   Contracts, laws, constitutions, etc.  Now I understand why all that happens   &mdash;   The shorter and more vauge a matter of legal prose, the more likely it is that a government can screw around with you.  The longer and more detailed, the less likely.</p>
<p>Personally, I now think our short Federal Constitution was a mistake.  Back in the days when I was complaining about wordy lawyers, I happened upon a document that showed what the Bill of Rights would look like if the Framers had it to do all over again in our time (then 1996).  The BoR would have been four pages long, at least using this paper&rsquo;s size and font size, and instead of just 10 items, it would have around 100 items.  Each given item would have been verbally qualified a lot more than their analogues in the 1791 BofRs.  Whoever wrote the document said that just as the Ten Commandments appears more than one place in the Bible, he said that the new, longer BofRs should be placed in the each of the sections that deals with the three sections of government, i.e. it would handcuff the President/Exec Branch and the Judiciary just as much as it would have handcuffed Congress.  This was at the time when Bill Clinton was pulling executive orders out of his business one after another after another when Congress wouldn&rsquo;t do what he wanted.  (That destroys the &#8220;Clinton moderated&#8221; myth I keep hearing stated over and over again these days.  Another subject for another day.  I&rsquo;ll tease it by saying that his &#8220;moderation&#8221; was only a front to get him re-elected, and, scratch the surface of welfare reform and DOMA, and they turn out to be ineffectual.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because &#8216;victims&rsquo; are given a higher status right now. Just as a coincidence, school teachers and the media seem obsessed with uncovering non-whites as victims. Another writer referred to is as &#8216;racelessness&rsquo;. That whites inhabit a sort of racelessness in a society obsessed with race. But that&rsquo;s not completely true, in that whites are often delegated to the role of oppressor. Others have even compared it to Nazi German. Where one group was to blame for all maladies past and present. And no mistake Germans were taught that they were victims of others machinations.</p>
<p>Personally, I wonder if the only thing that will change this victim supremacy mindset is whites as victims. I think it would.</p>

		<p>I am a bit disappointed (but not surprised) to see that not a single Amren poster understands the situation or what is going on with this woman.</p>
<p>So let me spell it out for you.  The majority of whites.  And 100% of non-whites, are incapable of thinking for themselves to the point that they will think, literally, whatever someone who identifies themselves as an authority figure, will tell them.</p>
<p>This woman isn&rsquo;t brainwashed so much as she is displaying this.  Someone (who probably has no actual authority&hellip;.or rather no base of power upon which to back up their authority) said to her, I&rsquo;m the leader of such and such group and this is what you should think.</p>
<p>There is a bit of cognitive dissonance going on because she showed up where pro-whites were active and their behavior did not match what she was told to think.  Note that this did not change her thinking.</p>
<p>Now, here is the important part.  What needs to be grasped.  Had a white nationalist with a dominant type of personality talked to her for a few minutes.  Told her a few things.  Then told her what she should think, she would have left as a convert.</p>
<p>There really is not much more to it.</p>
<p>Most whites and all non-whites will think what you tell them to, if you are a person with authority.  Notice that Obama&rsquo;s capacity in that regard has disintegrated recently due to extreme failure on his part.</p>
<p>Display competence.  Display power (economic, personality, martial, academic, religious, even sexual) and then tell people what to do.  Suddenly, what people think will change.</p>

		<p>For the most part, the article tells us little about the race realist movement. Instead, it gives a few snippets from here and there, along with much editorializing. It&rsquo;s as if the author fears that any more information might actually cause people to start thinking.</p>
<p>For example, she gives a line or two from Jared Taylor re black vs white intelligence, just enough to cause liberals to beat their collective breasts, but not enough to give the evidence behind Taylor&rsquo;s statement. It&rsquo;s not that this is a belief he made up out of thin air, of course, but rather something that has considerable scientific support: 100 years or so of IQ tests, as well as any reasonable observation of the level of civilization in, say, Europe versus sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p><br>
<i>This street hustler on the one hand dismisses white nationalism and pride as a minimal movement; on the other he infers it could like a cancer spread and threaten, well, I guess black nationalism and supremacy. </i></p>

		<p>@3 Anon,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
So what&rsquo;s the problem here? If whites want to preserve their<br>
own culture and live apart..why is this an issue? If they<br>
are so backward as to believe Western Civilization is superior why can&rsquo;t the blacks and Third Worlders<br>
let the whites go? It&rsquo;s not like blacks have any interest<br>
in white culture..so why not separate? Let us take our <br>
art, and music and science and political organizations..and<br>
be gone. Blacks should be celebrating their freedom..not<br>
cursing whites for their &ldquo;negative attitude&rdquo;. What is the <br>
problem?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Several actually&hellip;</p>
<p>1.  Pride.<br>
Whites are too proud to admit to their own defeat in a &#8216;lost cause&rsquo; for which fighting the good fight has now come down to a negotiated truce with those we sought to make like us and who now overrun our culture like a mad pestilence.  With a vain hope that if we pull back soon, we can mass and arise again without the embarrassment of Versailles type imposures later.  The longer we wait, the worse the situation will get as our population fraction of the pie will shrink.  But for the moment, what we lose as individuals to a common white cause will seem an awful lot like what we are being told we will lose eventually, anyway.</p>
<p>2.  Demographics And Value.<br>
Obviously, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to &#8216;sell off&rsquo; Louisiana, Nevada or Arizona at the same fractional values of New York or indeed any of the E/W Coastal States, overbuilt as they are.  We are rapidly losing the midwest to hordes of &#8216;refugees&rsquo;, who are brought here specifically in preference to African resettlement, -because- there is fear of a united White Homogeny in the Central timezone.  Throw in Hispanics that make a run on any agro business openings and you have some major forcing issues on a demography which cannot (is not built up enough to) support a &#8216;racially mixed&rsquo; society.  You can be sure they would want to move even less than whites would because they would be shifting -to- a black/brown economy.</p>
<p>3.  Logistics.<br>
If you want to rebuild a white society based on industry and proper land use (which is to say not filling every nook and cranny, continuing to have small families and winning through merit and competition whose rewards we _share_, amongst our own) you need to have major access to both oceans for raw materials delivery and hopefully, someday, meaningful exports again.  In less than 20 years after a white secession, most of the remaining nation would be too dangerous (and to poorly maintained as infrastructure) to be traverseable with bulk goods without massive &#8216;tariff&rsquo; protection moneys.  Nor could we do it, economically, by air.</p>
<p>4.  Security.<br>
The inverse of the above.  The U.S. exists as it does today because, even with 21st century technology, there is simply too much blue-space across which to transport a force to our hemisphere with intent to force a hostile landing operation or even to come up from one o the central American states.  All that would change with a CIS like American breakup, using Chechnya and Armenia as great examples of the influx of Islamic terrorism and ethnic strife to create &#8216;border issues&rsquo; that cannot be fought except by headlong incursion and bloody attrition warfare.  We would also end up paying through the nose to detooth nuclear forces (sold quickly, for cash, before their triggers went bad) so that such sophisticated WMD would not end up abroad.</p>
<p>5.  Profit and Loss.<br>
Through the unconstitutionality of certain &#8216;trade acts&rsquo; effects on the timber industry, I&rsquo;m sure that this country and by extension it&rsquo;s peoples, are on the hook in a big way to strip the best from our economic and natural resources in trade for what amounts to ignoring, &#8216;until an unnamed future point&rsquo;, our titanic debt.  The indemnification of which &#8216;for losses accrued&rsquo; would most assuredly be brought up in any Secessionist negotiations.  Since the white elitist establishment is -anything- but ignorant of who contributes the most to their worthless existence in parcelling out our way of life by the inch, there is no way on earth they would be stuck with the resulting debt load in a nation of worthless poor paeons who are not used to hard labor, that we might take even so much as a third of the least, for our own.  Remember, everything you have is mine and everything that is mine stays mine too.  Don&rsquo;t think that that doesn&rsquo;t apply to your labors as well.</p>
<p>It could be done.  And it would certainly be an education in the reality of &#8216;racism&rsquo; if the kind of mass exodus I expect were to actually take place as whites chose to live with racist whites rather than racist blacks/browns/asians.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t happen until it&rsquo;s too late because the only people who have a dog in this fight are the ones who stand to lose the most, last, within white America.  Not big government, not defense, not the social welfare enablement industry, not immigration or big business.  All of whom are -commited- to riding whites into the ground for the last penny possible.  But whites themselves are the ones who will ultimately lose the most for having done the least to deserve it.</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss they say but we are certainly ignoring the obvious.</p>
<p>Am I for it anyway?  You bet.  If only because I think that the best negotiating power we have with our nominal &#8216;leaders&rsquo; (gangster bosses should be so cruel) is that of striking against the productivity of our own nation.  And if we were successful, today, it would mean the end of foreign adventurism.  And the beginning of what our Founding Fathers demanded as a slow-growth and self-assured rise to our own social and biological evolutionary &#8216;next step&rsquo;.  Multicultural diversity is not that.  Too much of the planet is in fact too far lagged behind for it ever to be that.  Each people must take the steps they see fittest for their own kindred as they are able to.  We have been held back too long.</p>

		<p>When contrasted with the &#8221; supposed ultimate hate crime of all time, the W.W.II holocaust &#8220;; White/Euro-Stock Christians &rsquo;, aka, Western Civilization, treasonous, non-representative/ high socialistic, racial taxation; invasional immigration from the third world, non-White countries, self-destructive &#8221; diversity and end of segregation ; is small potatoes.</p>

		<p>What concerns me about the constraints of political correctness are the taboos against discussing black social pathology, and acknowledging that genetics is important to the human predicament.<br>
 <br>
Richard Herrnstein, E.O. Wilson, and Arthur Jensen have faced serious harassment because of their opinions. Less prominent people would have lost their jobs, as James D. Watson and Lawrence Sumner did.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;In his keynote Taylor, who believes Whites on average are genetically smarter than Blacks, rails against multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>As someone already stated, that&rsquo;s more than a belief. It can be demonstrated with testing.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to keep focusing on the idea that equality is a belief &mdash; and nothing more, with no evidence whatsoever to support it.</p>

		<p><i>Ours is a nation in transition, and change has always provoked ugly resistance.</i></p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re going to smear anyone who dares criticize the &#8220;transition&#8221; they wish to force on us. But the problem with &#8220;transition&#8221; has always been what comes <i>next</i>. It never just ends with the &#8220;transition&#8221;. And it&rsquo;s much preferable to face a little namecalling <i>now</i> than the second phase of their &#8220;transition&#8221; <i>later</i>. Evidence of this is amply provided by other examples of &#8220;transition&#8221; from around the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand people&rsquo;s anger about gangs, but we have to change out mindset and move from anger and punishment to understanding and exploration of the causes of gangs. &#8220;<br>

		<p>Anon #34, well put. And absolutely correct. We as a people are followers, easily swayed and led. You can witness this on a very small scale in personal relationships: A spouse or close friend or relative may have a different opinion than you about the looks of a new car model, or a television program. After a while, if you stick to your guns about your own opinion, theirs often will change and eventually come more around to your point of view. Except on very strongly held beliefs, you will see it happen almost every time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s enough time left, but I do see white Americans becoming more and more restless about being boxed in to this &#8216;No Freedom of Speech by Anyone Other Than Minorities&rsquo; society, saying among themselves what they are not allowed to say in public. The dam is about to burst.</p>

		<p>Not so long ago, at one of America&rsquo;s many failures to provide a world class education to those without economic privileges I got up to answer the question: &#8220;Does anyone really think that blacks are less intelligent than whites?&#8221; With a very loud, and positive &#8220;YES, I DO, and I can prove it trivially&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Despite Marxist policies that speech stood.  I think they were too shocked to complain. </p>
<p><br>
The simple truth is, they might nail one in one thousand of us behind such complaints, but to voice these things openly isn&rsquo;t as bad to ones career, and standing as one would think.  We just need to start doing it, and en mass. </p>
