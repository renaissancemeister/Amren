<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69P4T920101026">Arizona Voter Citizen Proof Requirement Overturned</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Levine, Reuters, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down an Arizona requirement that residents prove U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote but upheld a mandate that they present identification before casting their ballots.</p>
<p>Opponents of the 6-year-old law that incorporated both provisions  &mdash;  designed to prevent illegal immigrants from voting  &mdash;  said the ruling would likely lead to thousands of registered voters being turned away at next Tuesday&rsquo;s elections for lacking the necessary identification documentation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The appeals court is slated to hear arguments next week in a legal challenge to a separate newly enacted Arizona law requiring state and local police to check the immigration status of anyone they suspect is in the county illegally.</p>
<p>SPLIT DECISION</p>
<p>The Tuesday ruling stems from a ballot initiative, Proposition 200, Arizona voters passed in 2004 requiring individuals to produce proof of citizenship, such as a passport, to register to vote, and a picture ID, such as a driver&rsquo;s license, or two pieces of non-photo ID, in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p>Proposition 200 opponents have argued the polling ID requirements discriminate against minorities and the poor, who might not have the money to obtain the necessary proof of identification.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the 9th Circuit struck down the proof-of-citizenship requirements as being in conflict with a national voter registration law passed by Congress, which has paramount authority under the U.S. Constitution to regulate federal election procedures.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor was part of the three-judge panel that decided the appeal, joining the 9th Circuit as she has from time to time on select cases since leaving the high court. She concurred in the 2-1 majority in Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling.</p>

		<p>While this case does not stem from SB 1070, it&rsquo;s an object lesson about SB 1070 nonetheless.  Some of you wanted to jump off a bridge when the Federal trial level judge put a stay on part of SB 1070 back in July, and I tried to bring some reason to the debate.  Now here&rsquo;s proof   &mdash;   Prop 200 was passed six years ago, and one of its items just now made it through the Appellate Level.  If SCOTUS takes it up, it won&rsquo;t be until the 2011-2012 term in all likelihood.</p>
<p>SB 1070 might not ultimately get heard by SCOTUS until the end of this decade.  And there was another AZ proposition, Protect Arizona Now (PAN), passed after Prop 200 but before SB 1070.  Parts of that are in the courts.  Point is, you&rsquo;re going to hear a lot of news in the coming months and years about 200, PAN and 1070, from the judiciary.  Some of it will be good, some of it will be bad, and some of it will be mixed.  But don&rsquo;t jump off a bridge.</p>
<p>As an aside, voter fraud is really big on conservative talk radio this week.  Rush said today that if you require photo ID for voting and eliminate early voting and absentee voting, that eliminates 80% of all voter fraud.  Fine, but that would still leave 20% of the problem.  Elections are just too damned important to leave 20% of the problem unsolved.  Besides, there is no opportunity cost to solving virtually 100% of the problem compared to solving 80% of the problem.  The forces that directly benefit from voter fraud will push back just as hard if you propose to solve the first 80% as they would if you also include the last 20%.  And those forces aren&rsquo;t all black or Hispanic or Democrat  &mdash;  Plutocrat/establishment/ruling class Republicans have stolen elections from populist Republicans.  I can&rsquo;t remember the source or the exact state, but George H.W. Bush out and outright crooked Pat Buchanan out of a primary win in the 1992 Presidential primary season.</p>
<p>If you want to know what it&rsquo;s going to take to nip voter fraud in the bud once and for all:</p>

		<p>This is no surprise.  The decision was made by the 9th Circuit Court, our most leftist federal circuit court.  They&rsquo;re the same merry gang that struck down California&rsquo;s Proposition 187, which was to prevent illegal immigrants from getting taxpayer benefits from the state.  Thanks in large part to that decision California is now bankrupt.</p>

		<p>Voter proof of citizenship was overturned by a Federal court citing voter ID requirements discriminate against minorities and the poor, who might not have the money to obtain the necessary proof of identification.  The necessary items of proof of citizenship included such items as a passport and a picture ID, such as a driver&rsquo;s license, or two pieces of non-photo ID, in order to cast a ballot.  You know the stuff you show when you fly or apply for a driver&rsquo;s license.  <br>
And where is it written that the price of liberty, inclusive of voting, is free.  <br>
If the court was concerned that the poor might not be able to  afford to obtain proof of identification, then the court should have declared necessary state-funded help to procure adequate documentation.  Instead the default position favors allowing non-citizens and illegal immigrants to vote, compromising legitimate citizens voting rights.  Remember if someone casts an illegal vote, it effectively negates the vote of someone.<br>

		<p>I have to show a photo ID to buy Advil Cold And Sinus, but it&rsquo;s asking too much to require an ID to vote.  How upside down is this?  Most of you are too young to remember the days when every year you would see announcements on the TV saying it was that time of year when aliens were required to report to their local post office to check in.  Nobody back then thought that was unreasonable.  If you would have told anyone back then that one day aliens would highjack planes and kill twice as many people as the Japs killed at Pearl Harbor and we Americans would have sat back and put up with debate about a mosque at the cite of that killing, or rampant invasion by people hostile to America and its laws and customs, most people would have said you were crazy.  Maybe we are.</p>

<p>The article conveniently leaves out the fact that this is a bald faced lie.  There is no municipality in the US that doesn&rsquo;t have an easy method of obtaining these things for free if you can&rsquo;t afford them.  Proof of not being able to afford them, basically amounts to signing a line on the form and having the fee waived in ten seconds.</p>
<p>The 9th circuit has a point though.  Voter eligibility is a federal matter, for federal elections.  Arizona could push the point and say, well, we will allow those who didn&rsquo;t go through our process to vote in the federal elections&hellip;.but not the state and local elections.  But that is a pain in the a@@ and costs money to implement</p>
<p>They also could simply claim that since state and local elections are involved, the federal court system has no authority and then simply ignore them.</p>

		<p>Everytime I see my paycheck shrink from large social security taxes or read about another dumb decision, utterly unauthorized by the plain language of the US Constitution,I think of Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor and Ronald Reagan. Reagan may be the touchstone of conservatism for the Hannitys, but he was a sentimentalist without any grounding in real conservatism. His O&rsquo;Connor appointment ranks as one of the worst in US history.</p>

		<p>The only thing that law discriminated against was non-citizens wishing to vote and citizens wishing to vote multiple times, which is part of how democrats have locked up various districts all over the country. </p>

		<p>The State of Arizona should tell these black robed tyrants to go jump in a lake. Enforce the law anyway and dare the federalies to stop them.  Force the issue until we have pictures on TV of armed federal troops protecting illegal aliens while they vote. It will wake people up to that this government openly and brazenly betrays the American people and the Constitution and is therefore no longer the legal government.</p>

<p>I cannot even cash a check without presenting a state-issued photo ID, but these leftists object to the notion that one taking part in such an essential act of citizenship as voting be required to present ID.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but if someone is so disorganized in his own personal life that he can&rsquo;t even manage to get (or to not lose) a state-issued ID, then that tells me that he has plenty of other things in his life he should worry about besides choosing our political leaders.  People that irresponsible should be stayed from running for office, voting, serving on juries, owning firearms, or exercising other rights and duties of a citizen in a free republic. </p>

<p>Excellent observation by Question Diversity, and right on the money.   And, naming G.H.W. Bush is particularly outstanding.  Listen up, fellow AR readers.   Understand these truths:  The entire Bush Family, the entire McCain Family, the entire Gingrich Family, the entire Armey Family, the entire Cheney Family, the entire Hatch Family - plus Lindsay Graham, and Karl Rove and, yes, Sarah Palin - in addition to ALL of the Democrats in power today - are the mortal and avowed enemies of traditional conservative, racially aware White Americans.  </p>
<p>Every one of the above named rats cannot be trusted to defend or protect, let alone - advance - the legitimate ethnic interests of the White majority.    In fact, they will do the exact opposite at every opportunity, assuming whites are dumb enough to keep supporting these evil anti-white racists who might look &#8216;white&rsquo; on the outside, but on the inside - their souls are nothing but pure evil.  These people literally despise the traditional White America and the White Americans who helped create that old America. So, do not fall for their phony and insincere baloney about &#8216;caring about America&rsquo;, or about wanting to &#8216;Restore America&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s all bunk, people.  Its a con job, so wake up!!</p>
<p>Mark my words:  If whites are stupid enough to not wake up and purge these RINOs out of the GOP permanently, they will join hands with the Democrats and it will be business as usual.</p>
<p>Which spells White Genocide and the destruction of the White Western Civilization. </p>
<p>Anyone here ever heard of Harold Covington?   Recently, he made a comment on one of his radio podcasts that the number one reason why the White race has suffered nothing but an endless string of defeats in every skirmish that&rsquo;s been fought that involved the issue of White racial survival - is because whites have placed their complete faith in the &#8220;Conservative&#8221; party and it has been the &#8220;Conservative&#8221; party leadership who&rsquo;ve lost every battle.    Granted, these neo-cons who have hijacked the GOP are in no way &#8216;conservative&rsquo; - but, they are not totally to blame for the last 50 years of defeats.   The traditional &#8216;respectable&rsquo; Conservatives who controlled the GOP before them were and still are, to a large degree, totally spineless on the topic of race and a good example of that was William F. Buckley, who was instrumental in the purging of the race realists from the Old Right and clearing the way for these vile, anti-white &#8216;neo-cons&rsquo; to take over.    </p>
<p>See my point?  Purge the RINOs, and adopt a zero tolerance policy for White politicians who betray the interests of the White majority.  Make them feel the pain at the ballot box, people.</p>

		<p>Maybe just the fear of being caught at the polls will deter many illegals.  AZ should station regular law enforcement and deputized-for-a-day poll watchers in plain view.  Like black men burdened by outstanding warrants, most law-breakers don&rsquo;t want to get any notice from the cops.</p>

		<p>This is just one more ruling that is &#8220;beyond belief&#8221;.  If people don&rsquo;t start waking up, and fast, our country will be a third world country before we know it.  Then it will be too late to do anything.</p>
<p>The ruling on California Prop 187 was also &#8220;beyond belief&#8221;.  What is it going to take to save this country?  Maybe when we have mass murders with 10-15 persons per day being gunned down, like is currently happening in Mexico, then these judges will wake up and start making logical decisions. </p>
<p>The illogic of this is &#8220;beyond belief&#8221;.  People can show up at the polls and vote without identification?  What would keep a person from voting 100 times and using a different name each time?  (names given to them by someone who has somehow hacked into the list of eligible voters.)  </p>

		<p>I goofed up, and didn&rsquo;t understand the judge&rsquo;s ruling when I first made a post a few minutes ago.  I can live with the ruling that was made.  The key is that you must show ID to vote.  A driver&rsquo;s license in AZ costs between $10 and $25, depending on age.  Anyone that cares the slightest bit about voting should be able to afford those small amounts&hellip;.</p>

		<p>@1 QD,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you see that it is by this dilution of the moment&rsquo;s needs as the impetus for the legal recourse that useful legislation is destroyed both -before- it can take effect and improve conditions until -after- it is forgotten or any beneficial outcome rendered largely useless?</p>
<p>As WR The Elder stated: If Prop 187 had been allowed to be in place until it was seen to be &#8216;unConstitutional&rsquo; then California would be in a lot better shape today, which is to say not on the verge of requiring Federal bailout &#8216;like any other big Corporation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>IMO, the inertia of change is no longer a useful justification in having a system resistent to the creation of new laws via microscope scrutiny of legal checks and balances.</p>
<p>Instead, &#8216;the system&rsquo; has been perverted as a means to drag out the implementation of good legislation until it&rsquo;s advocates lose the interest of the people and are forgotten.</p>
<p>And the proof is in the opposition: if (particularly a State) conservative law was &#8216;good until proven otherwise&rsquo;, do you honestly think the liberals wouldn&rsquo;t scream and holler about the need to &#8216;stop it quicker!&rsquo;?  Wouldn&rsquo;t -they- demand and likely get a system of fast tracked judicial review?</p>
<p>There is no hope for this nation (Latin: nascere, &#8216;to be born&rsquo;, white) so long as it continues to operate under a system which assumed universal empathy by, for and of a people purely for their own benefit, present and posterity.  Not when that commonality has been lost in a flood of ethnic competition who see social perk alignments &#8216;by democratic rule&rsquo; of population majority as being racist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are so many minorities now that if we tear it down and start over, the rewards for homogeny will be &#8216;written out&rsquo; anyway.</p>
<p>The only solution is to pull back to a new dominant population position and make a nation that is a festung of white rule for whites.  Period.</p>
