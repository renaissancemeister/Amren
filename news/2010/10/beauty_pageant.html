			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Owen, The Australian (Sydney), October 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>HUNDREDS of people of African descent spent the holiday weekend fighting on Adelaide streets following a Miss Africa beauty pageant.</p>
<p>The wild weekend of violence culminated in four young men being stabbed during a brawl involving up to 100 people armed with knives, tyre levers, clubs, makeshift batons and a bedpost.</p>
<p>The fight erupted just after midnight yesterday, in a side street off the popular Rundle Street dining strip in the city&rsquo;s east end, adjacent to a police station. This followed 24 hours of clashes across the CBD, including a brawl involving 150 African men on Saturday night outside a venue in the Hindley Street nightclub precinct.</p>
<p>Police have charged four men  &mdash;  a South Australian, two Victorians and a West Australian. Those stabbed were in a stable condition yesterday after surgery. Chief Inspector John Gerlach said police planning for the Miss Africa pageant on Saturday afternoon, attended by more than 500 Africans from across Australia, had indicated it was &#8220;going to be peaceful&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;After incidents on Saturday night, however, police knew we had some problems. We do have other similar problems from time to time with the African community,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were liaising with our own African community leaders, but with so many people here from interstate, it made it very difficult to liaise with different factions from different community groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inspector Gerlach said it took police, called in from across Adelaide, up to an hour to quell violence. &#8220;There have been other incidents of fights .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. across the CBD over the whole weekend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This probably (is) a result of Africans attending the Miss Africa pageant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and might have contributed to some of the confrontation between different groups, as a result of African factions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shawn Clarke, the manager of the Norwood Concert Hall, said police were called to a large brawl as patrons left the event on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pageant organiser Adau Khot said the inaugural event, won by 19-year-old Emanuella Anyang, was incident-free.</p>
<p>Sam Thomas, manager of the Austral Hotel in Rundle Street, said he closed the pub yesterday when the fight erupted outside.<br>

Well, of course they do, this is how Africans just naturally act. <br>
Which begs the question; Why is Australia holding a &#8220;Miss Africa&#8221; pageant anyway?</p>

		<p>Sometimes when these beauty pageant stories pop here, some commentators say &ldquo;who cares&rdquo; when there is a Muslim miss USA or an Africa Miss UK etc.</p>
<p>Obviously these perpetrators care&hellip;<br>
&#8220;Police have charged a <b>Victorian man</b>, 20, with aggravated causing serious harm and fighting. A Kilburn man, 19, a <b>Victorian man</b>, 21, and a <b>West Australian man</b>, 22, were charged with behavioural and weapons offences&#8221;.<br>
(Yeah I bet they&rsquo;re as Ozzie as marmite and koala bears).</p>
<p><i>African tribal warfare</i> on the streets of a major Australian city, seriously words fail me.</p>
<p>But curious to what this &lsquo;Miss Africa pageant&rsquo; was all about, after a quick Google search these results came up.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an unanswered comment on this face book page from March 29 of this year  which says it all really.<br>
&hellip;.&ldquo; My friend from South African, (name blocked out) has a beautiful <b>Afrikaans</b> younger sister, would it be ok if she entered the pageant ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>190 days of Silence is their reply, so I assume these pageants must be a self esteem building exercise. <br>

		<p>And just why are there thousands of Africans living in Australia?  Who decided to import these primative people, who will never, never assimulate, and who will be an economic, crime, medical, and social burden forever?  </p>
<p>Were the Australian people ever asked if they wanted thousands of Africans imported into their communities?  How does Australia benefit by bringing in these people?  Will these people lower taxes?  Will they advance technology?  Will they reduce crime and bring society closer together?  Will they improve the overall educational achievement of Australian children?  Didn&rsquo;t you Australians learn anything from having large numbers of Aborigines?  How did that work out for ya, bloke?  And you think that the Africans will be any different?  Ha, Ha!</p>

		<p>What was not mentioned was the fact that a group of Austrailian youths were yelling anti-African and other anti-immigrant slurs at a group of African pageant attendees. In response, the attendees reacted by confronting the youths, thus violence broke out.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of any immigrant groups, but it is important to know what actually happened.</p>

Australia is too important to take on the violent errors of non-white immigration that plague America, Europe, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Australia is for Aussies first. White convict and proud.<br>
When I had the privelege of taking lone walks through the rural neighborhoods of Perth, Northam, Norseman, and Esperance, my pride glowed incandescent for a race who started out numbering but a few million and built a country like no other on earth.</p>
<p>Despite the black attacks, the non-white immigration now displacing Australians from their homes, and a government bent<br>
on Australia&rsquo;s destruction by peaceful means, European descended American&rsquo;s can trust Australians to be a common sense people<br>
as we have known them to be who will turn the tide and make<br>
things right for the good of the country.</p>

		<p>Oh, man, that is discouraging. I hope (assume) that&rsquo;s the last Miss Africa Pageant held there.</p>
<p>This is the first sentence of the article. Read it a few times:</p>
<p>&#8220;HUNDREDS of people of African descent spent the holiday weekend fighting on Adelaide streets following a Miss Africa beauty pageant.&#8221; </p>
<p>Human beings do not behave like that.</p>
<p>If I was advising the Australian government my advice would be 1) To see how quickly Africans could be removed from the country and 2) To prevent all African immigration into the country.</p>
<p>I have been to Adelaide. It breaks my heart to read this.</p>
<p>The black cancer upon civilization must be cut out. Australia had better wake up - and fast! As we in the US know the disease can spread rapidly and the scars are many.</p>

<p>The answers to all your questions are of course all negative. As to why they are here? &#8220;..we have an obligation under (some) UN ruling&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is yet another issue, the UN is little more than an unelected 3rd world left-leaning think tank, why should it dictate who has to be accepted by soveriegn nations.<br>

		<p>Well&hellip;<br>
I got home from work yesterday and my wife said to me, &#8216;there was a brawl at a Miss Africa pageant in South Australia.&rsquo;<br>
I reply, &#8216;Huh&hellip;South AUSTRALIA? Are you sure?&rsquo;<br>
&#8216;Yes, South AUSTRALIA!&rsquo;replies she. <br>
&#8216;You mean South Africa dont you?&rsquo;<br>
&#8216;No, I told you, South AUSTRALIA!&rsquo;<br>
I didn&rsquo;t believe her, I honestly thought she had heard wrong!<br>
Unfortunately for the real people here in DownUnderLand, as our fair land slowly descends into multicultural failure, the next Miss africa &#8216;pageant&rsquo; brawl will involve up to 1000, then the next one 2 to 3000 etc&hellip;</p>

<p>The answer is a resounding noooooo! Just as the blacks in the<br>
USA,UK and Europe are a cancerous canker in their respective societies so it is here downunder&hellip;actually African immigration on a fairly large scale is only a recent 20 year old phenomenon&hellip;the vast majority are of East African origin<br>
unlike the States and UK where most are of West African origin&hellip;regardless they are a constant headache as their numbers grow and with a watered down, political correct driven <br>
and often emasculated police force no wonder they are running riot&hellip;while their are a few exceptions I would say,along with   Pacific Islanders,they are the most violent and crime prone race and where there are large numbers of young ones congregating  as in the above article there is bound to be trouble<br>
 The problem is the Aussie public have no say in immigration policy but if they did I know what the result would be<br>
 In Melbourne there are some areas with large congregations of Sudanese and Somalis which have resulted in some places becoming no go areas despite there relatively small populations<br>
In fact the previous conservative govt placed a temporary ban on African immigration due to `assimilation problems`which was quickly rescinded by the following Labor govt&hellip;got the feeling things are going to get worse and this riot is a taste of things to come unless their numbers are drastically reduced or we come down much harder on them which seems very unlikely in the all dominant softy softy political correct climate                  </p>

		<p>Anonymous #4 compares the useless Africans living Down Under to the Aborgines. He believes each group presents similar problems. Aside from the indisputable right of Aborigines to live in their ancestral homeland, a race-based right. Aborigines are far superior to Africans. Even at their former Stone  Age socalled level, they were far more self-sufficient. Moreover, Africans are ridiculous, childish, and are utter cowards. The Aborigines fought with dignity. Australians could have done better by them. As for Africans, why do they live in Australia? As bad as the Asians do, is Australia so hard up for labor that it can&rsquo;t pay Chinese or Malays, if it must have immigrants, actually do the work the Africans pretend to do but no doubt don&rsquo;t do, don&rsquo;t do well, or simply take forever to do?</p>

		<p>my wife and I moved to Adelaide six years ago.  It was very pleasant to come here as it is safe and clean and was overwhelmingly White.  There is/was a large Asian community but very few black Africans.  Their numbers have exploded in the time we&rsquo;ve been here.  There have been numerous instances of cruel and extreme violence inflicted on our city by these people.  The number of Indians has also sky rocketed.  Meanwhile we suffer from ongoing water shortages and ever increasing housing prices which is becoming a big problem now.  Thanks for nothing Australian government, its disgusting.  I wish we would bring back the White Australia Policy, that worked well for us and would again.</p>

		<p>Good to see other comments from Australia re this posting.</p>
<p>Encouraging to see that Amren has some sort of following here. We also have the same concerns re Islamic &amp; 3rd World immigration and spineless politicians who bow down to the UN, EU and every other PC think tank and DONT listen to the 86% of Australians who are against all of this.Perhaps via Amren the message and awareness is slowly getting out.</p>
<p>As to # 5, Aussie youths were insulting these Blacks.Obviously expressing everyone elsesdeep frustration and anger, Black Africans are NOT WANTED here. Just like if I am not wanted somewhere, say at a social gathering etc I am sure I will be told to leave in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>The little I have seen of Africans (Of the many black tribes) in Australia they are bad news. Quoting one politician (caught off guard) &#8220;Unemployable welfare parasites&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in 2006 one of the West African Commonwealth games teams tried to defect to Australia, they sought refuge with a well known refugee activist in a well to do Sydney suburb, guess what, she immediately called the police! (And had them all put in detention)</p>
