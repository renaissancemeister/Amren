			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eve Ahmed, Daily Mail (London), October 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Much of my childhood was spent trying to escape Islam.</p>
<p>Born in London to an English mother and a Pakistani Muslim father, I was brought up to follow my father&rsquo;s faith without question.</p>
<p>But, privately, I hated it. The minute I left home for university at the age of 18, I abandoned it altogether.</p>
<p>As far as I was concerned, being a Muslim meant hearing the word &#8216;No&rsquo; over and over again.</p>
<p>Girls from my background were barred from so many of the things my English friends took for granted. Indeed, it seemed to me that almost anything fun was haram, or forbidden, to girls like me.</p>
<p>There were so many random, petty rules. No whistling. No chewing of gum. No riding bikes. No watching Top Of The Pops. No wearing make-up or clothes which revealed the shape of the body.</p>
<p>No eating in the street or putting my hands in my pockets. No cutting my hair or painting my nails. No asking questions or answering back. No keeping dogs as pets, (they were unclean).</p>
<p>And, of course, no sitting next to men, shaking their hands or even making eye contact with them.</p>
<p>These ground rules were imposed by my father and I, therefore, assumed they must be an integral part of being a good Muslim.</p>
<p>Small wonder, then, that as soon as I was old enough to exert my independence, I rejected the whole package and turned my back on Islam. After all, what modern, liberated British woman would choose to live such a life?</p>
<p>Well, quite a lot, it turns out, including Islam&rsquo;s latest surprise convert, Tony Blair&rsquo;s sister-in-law Lauren Booth. And after my own break with my past, I&rsquo;ve followed with fascination the growing trend of Western women choosing to convert to Islam.</p>
<p>Broadcaster and journalist Booth, 43, says she now wears a hijab head covering whenever she leaves home, prays five times a day and visits her local mosque &#8216;when I can&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She decided to become a Muslim six weeks ago after visiting the shrine of Fatima al-Masumeh in the city of Qom, and says: &#8216;It was a Tuesday evening, and I sat down and felt this shot of spiritual morphine, just absolute bliss and joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before her awakening in Iran, she had been &#8216;sympathetic&rsquo; to Islam and has spent considerable time working in Palestine. &#8216;I was always impressed with the strength and comfort it gave,&rsquo; she says.</p>
<p>How, I wondered, could women be drawn to a religion which I felt had kept me in such a lowly, submissive place? How could their experiences of Islam be so very different to mine?</p>
<p>According to Kevin Brice from Swansea University, who has specialised in studying white conversion to Islam, these women are part of an intriguing trend.</p>
<p>He explains: &#8216;They seek spirituality, a higher meaning, and tend to be deep thinkers. The other type of women who turn to Islam are what I call &#8220;converts of convenience&#8221;. They&rsquo;ll assume the trappings of the religion to please their Muslim husband and his family, but won&rsquo;t necessarily attend mosque, pray or fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I spoke to a diverse selection of white Western converts in a bid to re-examine the faith I had rejected.</p>
<p>Women like Kristiane Backer, 43, a London-based former MTV presenter who had led the kind of liberal Western-style life that I yearned for as a teenager, yet who turned her back on it and embraced Islam instead. Her reason? The &#8216;anything goes&rsquo; permissive society that I coveted had proved to be a superficial void.</p>
<p>The turning point for Kristiane came when she met and briefly dated the former Pakistani cricketer and Muslim Imran Khan in 1992 during the height of her career. He took her to Pakistan where she says she was immediately touched by spirituality and the warmth of the people.</p>
<p>Kristiane says: &#8216;Though our relationship didn&rsquo;t last, I began to study the Muslim faith and eventually converted. Because of the nature of my job, I&rsquo;d been out interviewing rock stars, travelling all over the world and following every trend, yet I&rsquo;d felt empty inside. Now, at last, I had contentment because Islam had given me a purpose in life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;In the West, we are stressed for superficial reasons, like what clothes to wear. In Islam, everyone looks to a higher goal. Everything is done to please God. It was a completely different value system.</p>
<p>&#8216;Despite my lifestyle, I felt empty inside and realised how liberating it was to be a Muslim. To follow only one god makes life purer. You are not chasing every fad.</p>
<p>&#8216;I grew up in Germany in a not very religious Protestant family. I drank and I partied, but I realised that we need to behave well now so we have a good after-life. We are responsible for our own actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a significant amount of women, their first contact with Islam comes from _dating a Muslim boyfriend. Lynne Ali, 31, from Dagenham in Essex, freely admits to having been &#8216;a typical white hard-partying teenager&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She says: &#8216;I would go out and get drunk with friends, wear tight and revealing clothing and date boys.</p>
<p>&#8216;I also worked part-time as a DJ, so I was really into the club scene. I used to pray a bit as a Christian, but I used God as a sort of doctor, to fix things in my life. If anyone asked, I would&rsquo;ve said that, generally, I was happy living life in the fast lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when she met her boyfriend, Zahid, at university, something dramatic happened.</p>
<p>She says: &#8216;His sister started talking to me about Islam, and it was as if _everything in my life fitted into place. I think, underneath it all, I must have been searching for something, and I wasn&rsquo;t feeling fulfilled by my hard-drinking party lifestyle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lynne converted aged 19. &#8216;From that day, I started wearing the hijab,&rsquo; she explains, &#8216;and I now never show my hair in public. At home, I&rsquo;ll dress in normal Western clothes in front of my husband, but never out of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a recent YouGov survey concluding that more than half the British public believe Islam to be a negative influence that encourages extremism, the repression of women and inequality, one might ask why any of them would choose such a direction for themselves.</p>
<p>Yet statistics suggest Islamic conversion is not a mere flash in the pan but a significant development. Islam is, after all, the world&rsquo;s fastest growing religion, and white adopters are an important part of that story.</p>
<p>&#8216;Evidence suggests that the ratio of Western women converts to male could be as high as 2:1,&rsquo; says Kevin Brice.</p>
<p>Moreover, he says, often these female converts are eager to display the visible signs of their faith  &mdash;  in particular the hijab  &mdash;  whereas many Muslim girls brought up in the faith choose not to.</p>
<p>&#8216;Perhaps as a result of these actions, which tend to draw attention, white Muslims often report greater amounts of discrimination against them than do born Muslims,&rsquo; adds Brice, which is what happened to Kristiane Backer.</p>
<p>She says: &#8216;In Germany, there is Islamophobia. I lost my job when I converted. There was a Press campaign against me with insinuations about all Muslims supporting terrorists  &mdash;  I was vilified. Now, I am a presenter on NBC Europe.</p>
<p>&#8216;I call myself a European Muslim, which is different to the &#8216;born&rsquo; Muslim. I was married to one, a Moroccan, but it didn&rsquo;t work because he placed restrictions on me because of how he&rsquo;d been brought up. As a European Muslim, I question everything  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t accept blindly.</p>
<p>&#8216;But what I love is the hospitality and the warmth of the Muslim community. London is the best place in Europe for Muslims, there is wonderful Islamic culture here and I am very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For some converts, Islam represents a celebration of old-fashioned family values.</p>
<p>&#8216;Some are drawn to the sense of belonging and of community  &mdash;  values which have eroded in the West,&rsquo; says Haifaa Jawad, a senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham, who has studied the white conversion phenomenon.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many people, from all walks of life, mourn the loss in today&rsquo;s society of traditional respect for the elderly and for women, for example. These are values which are enshrined in the Koran, which Muslims have to live by,&rsquo; adds Brice.</p>
<p>It is values like these which drew Camilla Leyland, 32, a yoga teacher who lives in Cornwall, to Islam. A single mother to daughter, Inaya, two, she converted in her mid-20s for &#8216;intellectual and feminist reasons&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She explains: &#8216;I know people will be surprised to hear the words _&#8221;feminism&#8221; and &#8220;Islam&#8221; in the same breath, but in fact, the teachings of the Koran give equality to women, and at the time the religion was born, the teachings went against the grain of a misogynistic society.</p>
<p>&#8216;The big mistake people make is by confusing culture with religion. Yes, there are Muslim cultures which do not allow women individual freedom, yet when I was growing up, I felt more oppressed by Western society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She talks of the pressure on women to act like men by drinking and having casual sex. &#8216;There was no real meaning to it all. In Islam, if you begin a relationship, that is a commitment of intent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Growing up in Southampton  &mdash;  her father was the director of Southampton Institute of Education and her mother a home economics teacher  &mdash;  Camilla&rsquo;s interest in Islam began at school.</p>
<p>She went to university and later took a Masters degree in Middle East Studies. But it was while living and working in Syria that she had a spiritual epiphany. Reflecting on what she&rsquo;d read in the Koran, she realised she wanted to convert.</p>
<p>Her decision was met with bemusement by friends and family.</p>
<p>&#8216;People found it so hard to believe that an educated, middle-class white woman would choose to become Muslim,&rsquo; she says.</p>
<p>While Camilla&rsquo;s faith remains strong, she no longer wears the hijab in public. But several of the women I spoke to said strict Islamic dress was something they found empowering and liberating. </p>
<p>Lynne Ali remembers the night this hit home for her. &#8216;I went to an old friend&rsquo;s 21st birthday party in a bar,&rsquo; she reveals. &#8216;I walked in, wearing my hijab and modest clothing, and saw how everyone else had so much flesh on display. They were drunk, slurring their words and dancing provocatively.</p>
<p>&#8216;For the first time, I could see my former life with an outsider&rsquo;s eyes, and I knew I could never go back to that.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am so grateful I found my escape route. This is the real me  &mdash;  I am happy to pray five times a day and take classes at the mosque. I am no longer a slave to a broken society and its expectations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kristiane Backer, who has written a book on her own spiritual journey, called From MTV To Mecca, believes the new breed of modern, independent Muslims can band together to show the world that Islam is not the faith I grew up in  &mdash;  one that stamps on the rights of women.</p>
<p>She says: &#8216;I know women born Muslims who became disillusioned an d rebelled against it. When you dig deeper, it&rsquo;s not the faith they turned against, but the culture.</p>
<p>&#8216;Rules like marrying within the same sect or caste and education being less important for girls, as they should get married anyway  &mdash;    &mdash;  where does it say that in the Koran? It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many young Muslims have abandoned the &#8220;fire and brimstone&#8221; version they were born into have re-discovered a more spiritual and intellectual approach, that&rsquo;s free from the cultural dogmas of the older generation. That&rsquo;s how I intend to spend my life, showing the world the beauty of the true Islam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t agree with their sentiments, I admire and respect the women I interviewed for this piece.</p>
<p>They were all bright and educated, and have thought long and hard before choosing to convert to Islam  &mdash;  and now feel passionately about their adopted religion. Good luck to them. And good luck to Lauren Booth. But it&rsquo;s that word that sums up the difference between their experience and mine  &mdash;  choice.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I&rsquo;d felt in control rather than controlled, if I&rsquo;d felt empowered rather than stifled, I would still be practising the religion I was born into, and would not carry the burden of guilt that I do about rejecting my father&rsquo;s faith.<br>

		<p>I know a woman who&rsquo;s independent, stands her ground, fixes her own transmission, owns her own rifle (and refuses to register it, which is a crime in Canada), and takes no guff from any man.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was surprised when she told me that a few years ago, she considered converting to Islam. Why in the world would a woman like her contemplate such a thing, I asked her?</p>
<p>She replied that she had a completely different mind set back then. Essentially, it was a time of turmoil for her. In western societies, we are expected as individuals to make our own decisions and forge our own destinies. People who can do and/or want to be able to do that are probably not going to convert to Islam. But people who are unsure about themselves, who insist on government assistance to meet their every wants, and who would rather see themselves as victims rather than recognizing that you have to deal with life&rsquo;s unpleasant punches and just get on with things, may very well succumb to Islam&rsquo;s siren call.</p>
<p>Islam means submission, not peace. If you&rsquo;re a true Muslim, your life is circumscribed by Islamic belief taken directly from the Koran. You don&rsquo;t have to trouble yourself with pesky thoughts about the inner good, whether gay marriage is a good thing or not, and so forth. Nor do you have to feel alone anymore, as you can meet plenty of like-minded people at a mosque and feel part of a community. Same thing with a cult, you might say!</p>
<p>So in other words, you&rsquo;re choosing security (to some degree at least) and acceptance over the uncertainties that come along with what Judeo-Christian civilization is based on - the belief that each individual is his/her own master and is responsible for his/her own decisions. When I make a mistake, I have to own up to it. I can do that. But if you&rsquo;re weaker-minded, that might be a problem.</p>
<p>We have always had troubled people in western societies. But now that Islam has made such inroads in our countries, it serves as a temptation that didn&rsquo;t exist in the past. Lefties in the west have venerated Chinese dictators and the Soviet Union. But those communist &#8216;paradises&rsquo; have pretty much disintegrated. Islam has taken their place as the dictatorship of choice.</p>

		<p>Note the facial expressions of the woman in the pictures.  Note the emotionless expression after she became a muslim, her stern glare that denotes that her joy and femininity are gone.  The woman looks like a suicide bomber.  These women are deranged.  They covet brown skinned muslim men and know this is the only way that they are acceptable to be married in that backward culture.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need to be overly concerned about whites converting to Islam.  Immigration and the disparity in birthrates are far greater dangers.  </p>
<p>People do things like this to gain attention and shock people.  It&rsquo;s really not much different than the punk rock scene in the late 70s in Britain.  In fact, I&rsquo;d say Camilla Leyland in the photo above on the right looks even more creepy than Sid Vicious.<br>

<p>Now if only they can get Muslim men to accept their way of thinking. If I remember right, Islam has this quaint custom called honor killing.</p>

		<p>I was afraid of this. Christianity in England having grown so weak through compromise, now has nothing to offer. Islam is plainly a false religion, but at least offers certainties that the modern religion of Leftism says do not exist.</p>
<p>People rebel against Leftism when they find it is hollow (there are no absolutes) and unrealistic (race doesn&rsquo;t exist), and seeing Christianity as weak and worthless, turn to Islam. They go from one falsehood into another, but each is poison for our race and way of life.</p>

		<p>Historically, women are the ones who convert to a religion before men, even a husband.  Before Christianity, a significant enough number of Roman women converted to Judaism, including Nero&rsquo;s neice.  The reason that women do this is a subject for musing and debate, but I think it has something to do with biology.  It used to serve a function in stabalizing genetics in tribes.  The modern remnant of that is that women undermine the structure that men build.   This is the real source and lesson of the Genesis story of Adam and Eve, unless you serious believe in talking snakes.  This is also why many religions like Islam have such restrictive rules regarding females.  In the West, we have gone completely the opposite direction, and the results are increasinly tragic.  Women, and particularly Feminists believe that they are superior to men.  This has been asserted over and over again in the past, and especially in the past 40 years.  Of course, since women have had access to everything due to AA and PC, women now have most of the jobs and the best ones, especially where government and media are concerned.  But in my little city, even the street sweeper trucks are driven by women, while men pushing baby carriages are not a rare sight.  Lately, even the media, has noted that women now have &#8220;all the jobs.&#8221;  Yes, women seem to occupy nearly all of the cusy jobs there are.  Men are free to work in construction, truck driving, and other dirty jobs, that women don&rsquo;t want.  When I do the the local dump, the women sit in the office in front with an air conditioner while the men work in the polluted, stinky, gardbage recycling building.</p>
<p>I have long heard women say that when they got control, they would run things better.  We have our present state of things largely because of the increased power of women.  The rejection of chivalry has been a large part of it.  Women feel that they can dress like street walkes, but be supported by law and society if they find &#8220;customers who are demanding.&#8221;   The examples of how quickly women corrupt once they have power, are legion and make Richard Nixon look like a school boy, caught in a prank.  I need not look far geographically or historically for local examples.  I see well dressed women in nice cars every time I go out anywhere.  I go down to our governmental sector and except for a few guards, I see women everywhere.  I went to court to make a legal change to personal information.  I had a female judge who laughed and joked while on the bench with two attorneys, while she deliberated in a debt collection case, while the municipal courtroom was full of people waiting their turn.  It&rsquo;s all a laugh, it seems.  Portland had a black police chief who didn&rsquo;t last too long.  He was fired for harassing a white subordinate after she broke off their inappropriate and technically illegal affair.  Then, they got her twin as the new police chief.  Now Portland has a really disfunctional police department headed by an short, overweight, blonde.  </p>
<p>I go to the local Sheriff&rsquo;s office and it is full of overweight women, laughting it up, like life and their work is just a joke.  I go there regularly.  Corruption in business and goverment has increased since women and minorities have &#8220;taken their place in society.&#8221;  Ever the mothering instinct is mistaken for governing rights and so we have our Pelosi&rsquo;s and H. Clinton&rsquo;s who think they can engineer society based on some idealistic utopia they vaguely think about, but act on daily.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not enough folks.  To show how far this has gone, The U.S. Army just announced the results of its annual contest for &#8220;Best Warrior.&#8221;  Must be new, I&rsquo;d never heard of it.  It is a contest where the competitor simulates cetain military functions, like clearing rooms in a block.  Not based on real duty records, just the time clock and how the judges think the goal was reached.  So you know women have arrived because the champion and Best Warrior in America is a young woman!!!  I can&rsquo;t think of a greater slap in the face to the squads made exclusively of men, and the speical forces units that have done the real fighting and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Face it dudes, this girl is your better.</p>
<p>Throughout history, women are behind the fall of every great man and nation.  Sometimes I really do understand why Islam has some of its attitudes and rules.  We are running headlong into a huge debacle, worldwide.</p>

		<p>These women have done what they have to escape their feeling of being mundane.  The enthusiasm of the convert is always greater than one born into any system of belief.  They are just another version of Heidi Klum, who used a black male singer to help catapult her attention getting capital.  (I just laugh when I see adverts for &#8220;Heidi Klum&rsquo;s Skin Secrets!)</p>

		<p>When you forsake your own religion, you alienate yourself from any good women. When a whole culture does this, any good women left will go to other faiths. Dont spit on Christianity as a whole just bc mainstream Protestantism &amp; Catholicism are a total joke. Study Orthodox Christianity and you will notice that Orthodox ethnic groups are the most ethnocentric White Christians for good reason</p>

		<p>These women are seeking to fill the spiritual void left by the atheist UK.  And because Islam has been allowed to gain entry to the UK, that is what they are choosing, instead of Christianity, which could fill their void, but which they don&rsquo;t see practiced.</p>
<p>They have found a convenient system to shun the West, but do they actually believe the doctrines?  Do they even believe in God?  I wonder.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll likely be crucified for this as it&rsquo;s sure to be misinterpreted by some but here goes&hellip;</p>
<p>Animals, by nature, have rigidly prescribed genetic roles. Man, being an animal, follows the same laws of nature. Feminism was a political movement to destroy a natural order.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t believe women should be excluded from education, sports, politics or anything, I do believe, by nature, men and women have different strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Feminism was/is an attempt to challenge the natural order. Women have been told by women that men think less of them and oppress them. Women can prove they&rsquo;re equal to men by challenging men at their own game they&rsquo;re told. Of course, when it comes to issues of strength, &lsquo;equality&rsquo; has to be compensated for and competition needs to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Islam offers some women what they want; male domination. NOT ALL women want this (nor is it desirable in the extreme in my opinion) but SOME women are, by nature, naturally drawn to this natural state of affairs.</p>
<p>In modern western cultures, women who decide to stay at home and rear children are considered by some to be, for the lack of a better word, failures. This is the pernicious lie of feminism. Islam allows some women to return to more traditional male/female roles in a way that, at present, doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a threat or concern to feminists (though it should be if feminists believe what they espouse).</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;anything goes&rsquo; permissive society that I coveted had proved to be a superficial void.&rdquo;<br>
Because when you rob people of their heritage, their tribe, and their greater social purpose, you are simply creating a vacuum. Racially aware and proud whites are unlikely to convert to Islam or embrace anything that is too contrary to their European blood.<br>
These women long for identity, they long for community, and they long for purpose. In a group, you have that purpose and meaning, and when you are proud of your ancestry, you are connected.<br>
Humans are social and tribal creatures. </p>

		<p>This woman cannot be European if she is Muslim. She can claim until the end of this dear earth that she is a &lsquo;European Muslim&rdquo;, but that is an oxymoron.  When she converted, she surrendered anything that made her European. She is not one of us anymore, she is no longer our sister. </p>
<p><br>
Moderate Christians, European pagans (those that practice ancient European religions), even nonbelievers are European, but Islam? It has no place in Europe, it has been spending a great deal of its existence trying to destroy Europe. Just look at how it treated the cradle of western civilization! <br>

<p>We have seen over and over and over that diversity is not our strength, indeed exposure to other cultures only encourages our people to leave White culture behind and adopt the practices of other cultures.

		<p>Europe has gotten so secular and shallow. The Christian church is pretty much dead over there and no wonder, it&rsquo;s gotten so dull. Many churches in the USA are much more dynamic and speak and present issues that are of today as well as have social activities <br>
so more Americans go to church or stay with religion. Many Europeans make fun of the fact that more Americans are religious calling us religious nuts but are completely unaware that their major religion is now Islam which is much much more conservative than any Christian.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure even men on Amren are ready to hear the explanation for this.  I know what it is but the average man isn&rsquo;t willing to accept it.  Neither is the average woman willing to say it&rsquo;s true but 100% would respond in a predictable positive manner.  That&rsquo;s ALL women&hellip;no exceptions.  Even ball breaking dyke like Elena Kagan (this issue is WHY she is like she is).</p>
<p>The gist of it is this.  Men are dominant.  Women are submissive.  That is the natural order.  In all things and to an extreme.  It is almost the only thing that matters for a society to succeed.</p>
<p>Anything else is unnatural and leads to sick behavior from both men and women.  Lacking this, a society is powerless and vulnerable to being exploited, enslaved, even exterminated by societies that accept this.  This is why islam is making inroads in the west&hellip;.despite hundreds of thousands of muslims being wiped out by our militaries.  Did I mention the issue is almost the only one to matter for the success of a society?</p>
<p>Now islam is sick and evil.  But not with regard to this issue with women.  Cutting off a woman&rsquo;s clitoris, keeping a hood over her head any time she is out of the house, locking her up and beating her regularly are all sick.  So is engaging in homosexual behavior as a near universal because you think women are unclean (something true of almost all muslim men and never talked about in the west).  Muslim men may be dominant over women&hellip;.but they are also all pole smoking faggots.  A concept difficult to grasp in the west where homosexuality is rare and those who practice it are weak and effeminate.</p>
<p>Despite all that sickness, women are willing to embrace islam because of a desperate need for dominance. Think about this&hellip;.women, raised in a free society, willing to embrace a way of life where they are beaten regularly by pole smoking faggots who think sex with them is disgusting.  What does that say about the importance of being dominated, to women. </p>
<p>You know what would be the mentally healthy thing for Lauren Booth? For Tony Blair and her husband to come to her and say, we don&rsquo;t care what crazy idea you have in your head, you aren&rsquo;t allowed to convert to islam.  For good measure, they should send soldiers to the local mosque where she got the idea, arrest the clergy and deport them&hellip;.and burn down the mosque.</p>
<p>Nothing would make Lauren happier.  That&rsquo;s the thing most men don&rsquo;t know&hellip;..even men on Amren.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing we need to accept if we want to win the race war.  It&rsquo;s the central issue.  But one I only see a tiny handful of men willing to embrace.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if this response even gets printed.  That&rsquo;s how far the taboo goes&hellip;.and also, how fundamental and important the issue is.  It brings up anxiety, fear and resistance.  Men don&rsquo;t want to face it.</p>
<p>But we have to.  Else there is no hope.</p>

		<p>The common feature of the Islamic convert is that of the lost soul. </p>
<p>This person frequently is a product of the Western counterculture.  Once upon at time, this person would have become a &#8216;born again&rsquo; Christian.  Why weren&rsquo;t they attracted to Christianity?</p>
<p>The nature and essence of any society comes out of its world view. In the most recent centuries, the West was predicated on the Christian worldview, and from this used its inherent strengths to build the most prosperous and free societies in the history of the world.</p>
<p>In the last several centuries the spiritual basis of the West has been eroding. The monotheistic tenents upon which it was founded were inherently unsound and incomplete, and liberals and secular humanists have worked diligently to expose these weaknesses. </p>
<p>A nihilistic and hedonistic society has risen, one ashamed of its own heritage and unwilling to fight when its freedoms are threatened.  It appears weak and corrupt to certain eyes looking for something unassailably strong to lean on.  </p>
<p>The creed of Christianity is associated with Western failure and lack of courage.  Islam is associated with trip-wire sharp sensitivity to any perceived slight, and the self-conviction to assert itself to adversaries.</p>
<p>It is this image of Islam that attracts these lost, counterculture types. It provides them not just with a visible calling that&rsquo;s been missing in their lives, but one that disagrees and turns its back on everything the West stands for. </p>
<p>Islam would not attract them if it wasn&rsquo;t a chip they could flaunt on their shoulder here in the West.  Very few of them want to move to an Islamic country, as they would be invisible and their conversion unremarkable. </p>

		<p>With the deconstruction of the West comes the reduction of our civilization to drinking and sexual promiscuity.  That&rsquo;s what these women take &#8220;western&#8221; to mean; that&rsquo;s what our leaders tell us is the essence of our culture and regimes.  These same people would criticize and reject the much milder strictures of Christianity, which integrate the philosophical with the ethical.  Their very acceptance of Islam is a by-product of the embrace of the &ldquo;other.&rdquo;  Though what they now embrace is profoundly illiberal, their preexisting liberalism was a precondition to their jettisoning one for of irrationality for another.

		<p>He explains: &lsquo;They seek spirituality, a higher meaning, and tend to be deep thinkers. The other type of women who turn to Islam are what I call &ldquo;converts of convenience&rdquo;. They&rsquo;ll assume the trappings of the religion to please their Muslim husband and his family, but won&rsquo;t necessarily attend mosque, pray or fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I can undertand all that, but why on Earth would white woman be attracted to Islam over Christianity?  I think it may have something to do with our modern culture: Christianity is demonized, Islam is praised and uplifted (usually).  So, naturally, woman seeking religion may seek it in Islam.</p>

		<p>To the poster who compared the current spate of conversions to Islam by Englsh women to ancient conversions of women to Christianity, I thought I&rsquo;d point out a difference.</p>
<p>Way back at the mid-point of the Roman Empire, when Xtianity was beginning to grow in influence, the religion was often spread, as you pointed out, by women converting their husbands to their faith.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine it working out like this in multicultural Britain.  The white Muslim she-converts will not be dating or marrying white British men.  They&rsquo;ll marry Pakis, Bengalis, Arabs, and Africans.  Instead of the front wave of the eventual conversion of Britain to Islam, they represent the front wave of the extirpation or displacement of white males and other white females from the British Isles.</p>
<p>When a white British man tries to marry (dates, or even flirts with) a brown she-Muslim, that tends to trigger honor-killing, and from what I know of the current thought processes of Muslims in Britain, most of them would be still be incensed and insulted if one of their females married a white male convert to Islam.  </p>
<p>So these women aren&rsquo;t so much as converts as they are traitors to Britain.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they convert to Buddhism, or Hinduism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Orthodox Judaism (hard to do but not impossible), Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, or some native European pagan faith?  Was it because they were intimidated (or too lazy) to deal with the mental and emotional work that goes into a religion like Buddhism?  Or was it the dim-witted but masculine forcefulness and aggressiveness of Islam that turned them on?</p>
<p>Thousands of British troops station in India during the Raj  &mdash;  perhaps hundreds of thousands  &mdash;  converted to Islam during their time there.  The principal difference between those British men of the Imperial past and these hopeless and heedless women of the British present is that those men remained BRITISH even after converting to the faith of Muhammed.  They fought for Queen and Country even as they bowed in prayer toward Mecca.  They also raised their children to be British first rather than Muhammedian (in fact, the principal love of Thomas Carlyse&rsquo;s life was born to a British soldier-convert to Islam).</p>

		<p>I believe most people, men and women, are followers by nature.  We all have the capability of being leaders and do-it-yourself type people, but most will follow IF they see a confident leader. People also need to believe in something that is bigger than themselves, be it culture, race, or religion, in order to sustain a society.  We in the West have denigrated all of the above and so we now stand at the precipice of our downfall. We teach that Western culture is evil, that to see race is evil and we allow the denigration of Christianity.  In addition to this, we see the diminishment of the White male in almost everything we see on television and in the other aspects of our lives.  These women (and I believe most women) are looking for, and in fact need, a confident, caring male in their life. They can hardly find one anymore in Western society, and certainly will not find one in the feminist world. As such, they will fulfill this need with someone else or with some other guiding influence. As they look around, it is easy to see why Islam is fulfilling this role.  Islam can be brutal, but given a choice between hoping for the best in Islam as compared to having no hope whatsoever in the nothingness of current Western society, these women are choosing Islam.  <br>
As a side note: Most career women I know who had/have no children will deny they ever wanted any. But without exception, ever woman I know who had one or two children, and where the children have now left the home, wishes they had had more. We think the low White birth rate and high Muslim birth rates are bad for us now, but this is only the end of the beginning. The next phase, where White Western Women are bearing ever more children to Islam, will truly be the beginning of the end.</p>

		<p>Thinking conservative whites have abandoned the major christian denominations because the major christian denominations have abandoned thinking conservative whites. The major christian denominational churches seem more interested in saving their organizations than in saving souls and the pathetic state of western governments is enough to turn any thinking white persons stomach. This, of course, leaves a great void in the hearts of people that can be filled by the likes of Islam and the Jim Jones&rsquo;s of the world. People want and need direction. People want to believe that there is a higher power that watches over them and cares about them and their interests. People want freedom but they also want to know what the boundaries of these freedoms are. People know that they cannot self-exist but need others. Hence the development of tribal units and beliefs. Our governments and churches have failed the white race so miserably and so uncaringly that they no longer have any credibility or validity. Every person is born with a spiritual void that must be filled with something to make that person feel at least somewhat complete. Our own institutions having failed due to the self interested dispositions of our so called leaders, Islam becomes an easy choice for some, though in my own heart I think these people who choose Islam are traitors to the white race and culture and should be ostracized. </p>

		<p>I hardly believe these women are attracted to Islam&rsquo;s theology but rather to its stable culture where men and women have defined roles.  Women are actually hard-wired for this, and if you have any doubt witness the continuing popularity of Jane Austen&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>Feminism attacked, and broke down the traditional roles for men and women in the West making everyone miserable.  So unfortunately, the only place where these Western women can find such a traditional gender structure is in Islam.</p>

		<p>With Islam you don&rsquo;t have to think or decide anything. You don&rsquo;t have to fret over controversial issues. Everything you are supposed to think is laid out for you. You just have to mindlessly obey and follow its endless ritualism. Islam means submission, by the way, NOT peace, as many people often say. Submission is slavery. And that&rsquo;s what Islam really is -  intellectual, artistic and emotional slavery. </p>

The hatred of whites and the West on the Left is so virulent that it is even willing to support replacing Western civilization with Islam, despite the fact that even the most moderate Muslim makes Jerry Fallwell look like a gay Unitarian.   These creatures just want to be on the  cutting edge of white-hating, West-hating racism.

		<p>Islam and Mormonism don&rsquo;t allow drinking, so I think that they pull in a lot of people who are struggling with substance abuse and want to drop their old boozy friends and have an instant new social network of teetotalers.</p>
<p>It is probably the same for a lot of women who have lived too long in the fast lane.  They have had too many sexual partners to be considered marriage material by the sort of men that they would like to marry, so they go off the deep end and convert to Islam.  Being white and newly celibate due to the religious conversion may be enough to give them a decent shot at marriage to a reasonably successful Muslim man.  I think that this is why the white converts ALWAYS wear Muslim garb.  They need to advertise their availability to Muslim men, whereas a girl brought up as a Muslim will have a Muslim name, Muslim appearance, and Muslim social network to help her find a Muslim husband.</p>

<p>These women are attention whores. They care little for whether something is right or wrong, and much about the opportunities it offers to feel important and groundbreaking and more-enlightened-than-you   &mdash;   more intelligent, moral, insightful and wise. To act decently and believe correctly where a sufficiently large group acts decently and believes correctly renders them intolerably unremarkable. Thus, to maneuver into their desired feelings of superiority, they must act indecently and believe incorrectly, and lo!, here comes unpopular, taboo Islam, or unpopular, taboo miscegenation, to give them them what they need!</p>

<p>Frankly, we have seen more women joining weirder cults in the US (such as Jim Jones, Heavens gate, Branch Davidians, etc.)</p>
<p>I am willing to take a bet that there are many more cases of Western women renouncing Islam (such as the author of the article) than the other way around.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, you&rsquo;re right.  Women are frequently the first to convert to new religions.  The fate of the first Greenland colony was sealed when the wife of Eric the Red converted to Christianity.  Sending donations to the Church in Rome, when they should have been building infrastructure, probably resulted in the death of the entire founding colony, when the climate took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m beginning to see that the beginning of the end of the West was when women gained the right to vote.  Female narcissism frequently takes entirely different forms from male narcissism.  Converting to religions whose objectives conflict with the well-being of one&rsquo;s own group&hellip;.that&rsquo;s definitely &#8216;A Chick Thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Women are more apt to get all the little details of something right.  Men are more apt to grasp the bigger picture (rather a crucial skill, if a group is to survive), than to get hung up on the little details.</p>

		<p>Religion has been a casualty of modernity, and Islam will ultimately suffer the same fate as Christianity.</p>
<p>As an atheist I&rsquo;m ambivalent about the deaths of religions - so many religious practices over the centuries have become inextricably woven into the fabric of the identity of peoples worldwide that to lose a religion is to lose a piece of that identity. On the other hand, once the genie of modernity is out of the bottle, I don&rsquo;t see how religion can survive, much less be brought back to life once it&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>But the onslaught of modernity that is killing religion, and which brings us materialism, consumerism and globalism doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to roll over and abandon our distinct identities as European, as white, as Germans, British, Swedish, Dutch, French, etc. Our simple existence and our natural expression of how we live is plenty to fill the void left by religion&rsquo;s death. Our &#8220;religion&#8221; can be our families, our communities, our countries, our cultures, our identities, our natural way of being. This is plenty to withstand the crush of modernity.</p>
<p>The tragedy of these women converting to Islam is that materialism and the rest of it has so debased middle class white families in Europe that this odd, angry, primitive cult actually has some sort of appeal. It is too late to stage a religious revival to fill the void that Islam would love to fill, but it is not too late to revive our family life and our lives as white European peoples. Belief in our identity and permitting the natural expression of our way of life is all we need. Easier said than done, I know.</p>
<p>The practical means towards reasserting our identity is to shut the door on immigration, of course. And to protect our regional economies. To end the noxious doublespeak of political correctness and multiculturalism. To allow indigenous majorities to assert themselves again and be allowed the right of self-determination. And how about this: an educational system which is proud of the West&rsquo;s accomplishments!</p>

		<p>for centuries, whites have been despairing at the &#8220;decadence&#8221; of our own culture and joining primitive cults (the moon church, communism, paganism, hare krishna, 10 thousand others) to find a lost &#8220;spirituality.&#8221;</p>
<p>this is a kind of mental perversion, a sickness.</p>
<p>european culture has profound spiritual resources - no need to go shopping in the mall of ethnokitsch.</p>
<p>Islam is incredibly primitive compared to christianity - that is apparently the attraction.</p>

		<p>Nearly all evolutionary biology has common sense answer. Women more easily embrace foreign or alien culture because that ensures survival when the men/warriors of their tribe are wiped out by an enemy tribe.  Ancient religions saw and acknowledged and warned against this then attempted to lock down the women to prevent them from defecting *before* their males. <br>

		<p><i>How, I wondered, could women be drawn to a religion which I felt had kept me in such a lowly, submissive place? How could their experiences of Islam be so very different to mine?</i></p>
<p>Answer is simple, all negatives regarding Islam are cultural not doctrine. Most Muslims follow the Hadiths which are responsible for most everything negative (they are stories about the prophet from those closest to him, and add a zillion additional rules that were NOT in the Quran).</p>
<p>Technically if it is not forbidden (in the Quran) it is allowed, and that means most everything is allowed (i.e. drinking, dogs as companions, uncovered hair though modest clothing is stated, temporary marriage, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>Western women are free to interpret Islam as it was originally intended, a way of relating to God, and they are free from all the other silly cultural rules.</p>

		<p>I am a bit surprised that many readers here blame the losing appeal of Christianity for the above conversions, hence want a more Christianized West to counter Islam.</p>
<p>Christianity made Europe great, but it was only an accident of history that it happened the way it did. It is after all a Semitic religion, with its roots in Palestine. It&rsquo;s contribution to European greatness ended with the Renaissance period, after which many great stalwarts of Western civilization saw it as an impediment to scientific and intellectual progress.</p>
<p>Within Europe, Scandinavian countries like Sweden which are highly advanced have the lowest percentage of people who call themselves believing Christians, and the highest number of atheists. In fact, studies have shown that a higher IQ is positively correlated with rejecting blind beliefs (including all religions).</p>
<p>In contrast, creationism is being taught in schools in Kansas. Regressive, to say the least.</p>
<p>Islam may be evil, but Christianity is no panacea. It is only a lesser evil.<br>

		<p>There have been some interesting comments on this topic and I have noticed 2 main themes;</p>
<p>1, The demise of Christianity in the West, this is very sad and very true. It has been choked by the weeds of this world and a general lack of belief and or interest for at least a generation.Sadly also many churches have been involved in left leaning political causes. In the meantime the Sword of Islam is marching ever militant.</p>
<p>2,Feminism, this movement in the guise of fairness, equality, fulfilment etc has done little more than rip apart the whole fabric of society as we know it and is causing disasterously low birthrates to the white educated middle classes in the West.Perhaps some of these previously &#8220;liberated&#8221; career women simply convert to Islam as a way of getting back to the natural order of things.<br>
If there is one single element of admiration for Islam it has to be that it is one of the few &#8220;organisations&#8221; which is able to put some sort of a brake on rampart feminism. Muslim clerics here in NSW have been the only effective voices against some of the over the top things that were being taught in public schools in the name of personal development aka sex education.</p>
<p>Having said this I still feel that Islam is an evil dark religion that poses a much greater threat to western society than Chairman Mao or Stalin ever did.</p>

		<p>What a sad photo. A woman threw away her own culture and freedom. She looks ridiculous and has no business in Middle Eastern communities. The problem is that white Christians have completely lost their ways. She makes a point when she comments &#8220;I walked in,&hellip;. and saw how everyone else had so much flesh on display. They were drunk, slurring their words and dancing provocatively.&#8221; There was a time when Christians actually had some modesty and moral boundaries. There were limited choices and social events were often held at churches. My parents and grandparents all met at church youth groups. They weren&rsquo;t that prudish. They liked music (Sinatra, Elvis, etc) and dancing. They even admitted to attractions and temptations. However they also had self control. They had respect for God, country, and their elders. Youths and middle-aged people of today laugh at this lifestyle. A church social, respect? No, it&rsquo;s all about dirty dancing, gangsta rap, promiscuous sex, drugs, food stamps, illegitimate children, flipping off elders, etc. There are so many sleazy choices with no consequences. The handful of youth who see something wrong with this have no churches to turn to. Christian churches appear corrupt, dated, or weak. They join some radical foreign religion, or a cult for the lack of any other alternative. Our white Christian youth has been destroyed by  outside influences of sleaze. I&rsquo;m not sure what could turn this around other than extreme hardship&hellip;when there is again a lack of choices and temptations.</p>

		<p>Islam requires women to be under the control of a man- husband father or son- and it does not mention that any of these ladies are married. As soon as they marry a Muslim man their lives will be horrifically different. I was married to a Muslim man and endured the most horrific abuse, running the gamut between verbal abuse and insults to choking and hitting. Mostly I was just ignored and forced to sleep on the couch. I barely escaped with my health intact at age 23. 15 years later my life is recovered, I am remarried and have a wonderful life. Not all of these converts are so lucky, many women go from Muslim man to Muslim man, thinking that each time will be better. They are abandoned at about age 40 since youth, fertility and beauty are prized in Islam. Converts are also looked down on as either breeders or cannon fodder and not much else. As far as &#8220;why&#8221; do western women turn to Islam? Feminism definately plays a role. Also poor self esteem and Islam telling them that they do not have to compete physically play a part. After I left I was a mess both physically and emotionally. I worked on myself and lost a huge amount of weight but emotional healing was harder. These women will learn and eventually return to western society- most female converts will return in around 3-5 years. Male converts have an easier time but will not be allowed to marry a native Muslim woman.</p>

		<p>A large group of Islamic converts in the US happens to be black convicts, not exactly a very intellectual group. The women in this article are all misfits. If a person wanted to become more religious they could just dig deeper into Christianity without jumping ship to some foreign import. People like this are unstable and switch around a lot, one day a Muslim, the next some new age hodge-podge, perhaps then a Hare Krishna, and so on. The Muslims are just getting our crackpots, that&rsquo;s all. </p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;ll likely be crucified for this as it&rsquo;s sure to be misinterpreted by some but here goes&hellip;Feminism was/is an attempt to challenge the natural order.</i></p>
<p> I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree with one single word you write, I would only like to add that I believe Feminism was/is an attempt to break apart White society, White Culture on a familial level; to deliver a fatal blow to Whites by atomizing and trivializing Traditional White American families.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worked.</p>
<p>Feminism is nihilistic.</p>
<p>Feminists demanded:  Abortion on Demand as a Right.   Free Government-directed Day Care  so women could compete with men outside the home.  Feminists scorned housewives as derisive &#8216;hausfraus&rsquo; (connection to German/Nazis).  They demanded The Pill and Reproductive Rights. They demanded easy, no-fault divorce and freedom from the kitchen.  They insisted, stupidly, that women and men are &#8216;biologically the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were things that women were to desire:  abortion on demand, easy, no-fault divorce, freedom from children, easy access to The Pill, that plus superiority and dominance over men.</p>
<p>Single, childless, powerful, rich women were held up as examples for young girls/women to emulate, their position to strive for.  The Ultimate Super powered Female was a  CEO, airline pilot, ultimate corporate executive, bank president  &mdash;  alone, single, childless, free to do as she desires!  We Females didn&rsquo;t need men! (we were told) They only get in the way!! (we were told) Children?  In Our Way!.</p>
<p>Advertisers, the media, the schools, academia pushed this message on White American Females, young or old.</p>
<p>No wonder psycho-therapy is a booming business.</p>
<p>But&hellip;.I feel strongly that this is changing (and not a moment too soon).  The results of this indoctrination?   (And I should know, I was educated right in the midst of it and believe me, this was 100% mainstream thinking at the time).</p>
<p>Huge divorce rates, leaving broken families, expendable kids dropped off at day care at 6 AM and picked up at 7 PM or later.  It worked, the Feminist Vision (at least for a while).  It broke up a lot of White American Families, just as it was designed to do.</p>
<p>But, it&rsquo;s always the kids that pay the price.  I see the result of this in the schools every day   &mdash;   kids with little/no supervision, huge rates of drug/alcohol use (to counter depression and other types of angst), disconnect from school and parents, a &#8216;nihilistic&rsquo; affect, in therapy for anger management, disaffected attitude, drugged up on psycho-tropic, mind-altering/bending drugs.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura has been countering this for decades, and I believe she has made some head-way. No longer is the k-12 school curricula completely consummed with &#8216;Women&rsquo;s Rights&rsquo; and/or Woman as Victim.</p>
<p>But the much-hounded Dr. Laura and her message of traditional family values will be off the air in two months.</p>
<p>You posters above (Matt, Eric, KH, Whiteplight, Anon #12 and #16, Jay, Visine),  who believe women are seeking something, a place to be, to belong, to identify with, who have huge holes in their psyches from lack of identity or belonging are entirely correct in your assessment of what is causing Whites, women in particular, to seek out Islamic values.</p>

		<p>Christianity has become neutered in the last few decades. When I think of a Christian male, I think of a wimpy, cowardly male, a nerd. They champion women&rsquo;s rights, minority rights, they bring in millions of nonwhite peoples and their religions and cultures. They promote White Christians to adopt African kids. They believe in interracial marriages.  They claim all religions are the same and God doesn&rsquo;t discriminate. They don&rsquo;t want to offend anyone.  They preach peace and love and forgiveness. The Christian White male is not the dominant man a woman needs. What happened to the Christian warrior? </p>
<p> White women are easily swayed, more so than nonwhite women. In fact, they wanted their cake and eat it to. The Feminist movement made sure of that. These same women jumped on board and now after all their sexual escapades, acting and behaving like a man, aborting their babies, drinking themselves under the table, and acting like fools, they have shoved the White male under the bus to take up with barbarians. I am a White woman and I find myself loathing what many White women have become. Traitors to their own blood and denying the birth of White children in favor of having &#8220;rainbow&#8221; children. These kind of women love to be &#8220;trendy&#8221; and crave negative attention.</p>

<p>They have 2000 years of Eastern and Western Christian mysticism and knowledge to draw from, much of it written by women, from Teresa of Avila to Kathleen Norris.  They have no knowledge of the culture they&rsquo;re throwing away, and no clue that their embrace of Islam is itself motivated by the Western, materialistic desire to stand out from the crowd.  If they moved to a Muslim country they&rsquo;d be nobody at all.</p>

		<p>I live in Utah and I see beautiful LDS couples- presumably fertile since many of them have 2-3 of their own children- with an adopted child from some third world country, usually Africa. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder what is going to happen in a few years when these kids hit the teen years and want to date the beautiful blonde girls that Salt Lake City is full of. Early missionaries from the LDS church concentrated in the Scandanavian countries so Utah is very blonde and fair skinned as a result. I would venture a guess that more than a few LDS families will be horrified when their daughter shows up with some Ethiopian adopted kid as a prom date! </p>
<p>In some ways the phenomenon of women converts to Islam is similar. Women who for whatever reason have not fit in can feel that they magically fit in to Islamic society when nothing could be further from the truth. The American or British convert will be segregated with Luther countrywomen while the native Muslim women shun and make fun of them- they never see this since the conversation is in Arabic or Urdu. After a few years of isolation or spousal abuse the woman will return to her own society- however flawed. Feminism and liberalism have soured so many young women against Christianity so women seeking a more conservative home life runs to the most non-western thing thing they can find- Islam. </p>

		<p>I definitely disagree with some of these comments. I do not think for one second that feminism was intended to destroy the family or be superior to men or anyone else. Women at the time wanted opportunities to make money, have freedom to do what they want in life, etc, same as men do. This in no way denigrates motherhood. Most women I know today in fact do want kids and value family. It&rsquo;s a lot of the men that won&rsquo;t commit. Does anyone really think that if men were the ones who could get pregnant, that they wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten the Pill and other reproductive rights? Of course they would have and they would have wanted them. Also, things so as no-fault divorce, the Pill etc are wanted by men just as much as by women as most men don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t support 10 kids or don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in a bad marriage. More people divorce today because they can and women don&rsquo;t have to put up with abuse, alcoholism or adultery like they did in the past, which is good. I don&rsquo;t think anyone today takes divorce lightly and most women I know value their kids very much and I see many good kids.</p>

		<p>#44 presents a key (and ignored point). As a group, women have little group or territorial loyalty, because these instinctive values were detrimental to the genetic survival of their previous millions of female ancestors. It was to a humanoid female&rsquo;s advantage to be nice to whichever males were dominant; these males could provide food and protection. Ex-dominant males were useless or dead. </p>
<p>What makes the modern situation different is that women have gained political power in western and industrialized nations. Women vote, and that means that politicians in these countries must gain women&rsquo;s votes to stay in office. This means that women impose their prehistoric female values on democratic governments. These governments don&rsquo;t defend their territory, and the women mate instinctively with the conquering  males.</p>

 </p>
<p>Thank you, Sonya. That&rsquo;s enlightening. I note  too that other religions also become influenced (and burdened) by local cultural practices. Certainly, Roman Catholicism as practiced in Peru is not the same as that in Poland. And even the Jews have become fractured into many, many interpretations and sects who can&rsquo;t agree with one other on almost anything. These religions are not so monolithic as they seem.<br>
 <br>
As you&rsquo;ve pointed out, the apparent obsession of [some] Moslems with genital mutilations and such matters is really an African aspect that has been introduced, and is not Islamic at all.  (But try telling them that!) Likewise the attitude to dogs. Even circumcision is not mandated (nor even mentioned) in the Koran.  There was an Egyptian professor who pointed that out a few years ago.  He was fired from his job and imprisoned for subverting Islam. <br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s very hard to separate the culture from the religion, they become so intertwined,  and many persons just can&rsquo;t tell the difference. </p>

		<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read all kinds of explanations here of why these women converted to Islam but have yet to hear one which is more realistic. Pretty much all replies are akin to treating the symptoms than fix the causes. Here&rsquo;s something to consider.</p>
<p>1. Face it - Islam is superior in ideology. It tells you how God wants you to live than you decide by experimentation. Notice how there are new advisories from all kind of government agencies of what to do and what not to do. Islam settles for one and permanent solution. Remember most people are sheep, they like to be commanded, they like to be told, they like to be instructed. Christianity gave it all away when our Church Lords started changing the word of God in favor of what people would like to hear and accept.</p>
<p>2. Freedom of choice - you think you are free? Here&rsquo;s a surprise for you. You all are slaves of what media, GOP, Liberals tell you and your frame of mind never exceeds what you hear and are told. Remember Matrix movie. We are bred to pay taxes, pay high prices for cheap quality goods, and to live this rat race of consumerism at the expense of many and to the benefit of a few.</p>
<p>3. Ever ask your wife or daughter how she feels when she goes out and has to compete man on man&rsquo;s turf? She has to imitate a man, she has to play by his rules to earn the bread, she has to worry about looking sexy than concentrate on what is real in life. </p>
<p>4. Islam believes in &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; not in the &#8220;sameness of both sexes&#8221;. Face it, women are different. They are more precarious, they are bodily weaker, have huge capacity for compassion, are more emotional and little less logical in favor of compassion and hence chosen by GOD to be honored as the carrier of human race. In Muslims&rsquo; view, women are more respected, are higher value, more complicated and hence more valuable humans than men. Men are more logical and stronger but for most part are totally incapable of bringing humanity to human race. In Islam&rsquo;s view women are Porches, men are Chevy trucks. Women are more sophisticated as oppose to men. Islam gives women their proper place, a much higher place, than the western women can even imagine. Men are the protector, the bread earner, and the 1st in line in the face of calamities. Women are more precious, more protected, more of a consumer than an earner, and are valued much more than a man. No wonder western women who see this gets attracted to Islam.    </p>
<p>Wonder why am I writing this. I used ot be in military (special ops.) and I came to see the Muslims cultures as part of my job. I saw the reality up close and I saw the light. I&rsquo;m over 50 now and am a secret Muslim because in the town I live in, my much biggoted Southern Baptists friends would shun me if I ever tell them the truth. Go figure - </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t these leftist writers publish stories about the women who flee Islam, because they don&rsquo;t want to be killed, beaten or stoned, to say nothing about having to live day after day wrapped up like a mummy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen and heard a few being interviewed and they&rsquo;re quite bitter and they hold great resentment against ALL Muslims, especially the men. </p>

		<p>In my Southern town, there are two kinds of people who convert to Islam: African-Americans (seems the prison ministry is particularly effective), and white, middle-class women. I, too, have been mystified by the latter. Thanks Doug (61) for your insights  &mdash;  and the fact that you choose Islam doesn&rsquo;t take anything away from me: I value liberty, and respect that others may choose a different path. Salaam!</p>

		<p>I reckon hardline Muslims had better watch out.  </p>
<p>No doubt, these Western females who admit to having been feminists and thus still retain feminist &#8216;values&rsquo; are infiltrating Islam in order to topple its central pillars from within, in exactly the same way they did with Christianity in the West.</p>
<p>Before you know it, such females will be demanding positions of equal representation in the strictly male only clerical domain.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m sure Imams shall prove to be more than happy to accommodate these female&rsquo;s demands in that department without prejudice - not!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure where &#8220;Evilleer&#8221;got the idea that &#8220;thousands,if not hundreds of thousands&#8221;of British troops stationed in India converted to Islam,had this been the case the nightmare scenario we now face in England would have come to pass more than a century earlier.Also the anonymous poster who claimed that the LDS specifically targeted Scandinavia is wrong. For while there is some imput from the region,the vast majority of Mormons are of English descent.This has made Utah the only state in the union with an ethnic English majority.Returning to the original point:The recent trend for professional women in Europe converting to Islam should be seen as nothing more than an update on an age old theme of attention-seeking exoticism.Far more worrying are the unrecorded conversions of countless working-class women who represent the true face of Islam&rsquo;s inroads into the european mainstream.  </p>

		<p>Doug #61, very entertaining and thought provoking comment. Call me old-fashioned; I like the idea of women being treated with class  by men (if they act deservedly). Granted, very few American women do so. I like men opening doors for me - not that I can&rsquo;t open my own doors and have no problem doing so - but I like men who were taught simple manners and respect for women. So I find it very hard to correlate Islam&rsquo;s belief and practice of stoning women, cutting their ears off, genital mutilation and forcing the covering every woman&rsquo;s entire body with holding women up on a higher, more revered place. Even in the heathenistic U.S. my wonderful, devoted husband would never desire to cut my private parts or hit me in the head with rocks to punish me.</p>

		<p>She looks shamed and tamed to me. While there are an infinity of lessons to be drawn from behavior this women exhibited, ultimately it seems to be a simple case of, well, a simple case. She had a pretty nose and cute smile in photo one that masks the vacancy which screams out in the second photo. You wonder if she is aware that women dressed just like her were made to kneel in a soccer stadium, then shot in the head in Taliban-occupied Afghanistan for prostitution. Probably not.</p>

		<p>Those women probably suffer from personality disorders or severe issues. I don&rsquo;t know why a Christian woman in her right mind would convert to Islam. In fact, she would be disgusted at the thought of it.</p>

		<p>Interesting discussion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d add that one reason for conversions to Islam is the failure of Western elites to maintain any pride in their own civilization. Western religion was one of the first things to go, with liberation theology and various denominations taking up the cause of egalitarianism. It is no wonder that more people are jumping ship to a religion which seems, perhaps, to be the wave of the future.</p>
<p><i>The reason that women do this is a subject for musing and debate, but I think it has something to do with biology.</i></p>
<p>No doubt. Increasingly feminized Western societies have little attraction for female genetic drives. Islam, by process of elimination, seems to be coming out on top in the current competition for DNA.</p>

		<p>Muslims know that the secret beauty of their religion is a false promise of many good things, pure love from a husband, perfect peace to all believers or not; it&rsquo;s like in Napoleon Dynamite when there is a promise made of - vote for me and all of your wildest dreams will come true.&rsquo;<br>
Yes, people are ignorant enough to believe this.<br>
The bible describes Muslims as simply evil, that once they have their &#8216;peace&rsquo;, they will destroy the world- or the end will come, essentially, after a false 7 year peace treaty with them.<br>
These &#8216;corporate simpletons&rsquo; who fall for this aren&rsquo;t intelligent to seek ALL of the answers and are listening to what they &#8216;want to hear&rsquo;. <br>
I&rsquo;m sure there are many good Muslim husbands, BUT, in Islam, a woman is lower than a cow or dog, because those animals have a purpose. Once a woman refuses to clean or do as demanded by the husband, she will be beaten - sometimes to death. This is completely legal and common practice.<br>
CHRISTIANITY ALSO teaches - in the bible that men are superior to women. Disagree ? Research this bible quote - &#8220;woman as  a weaker vessel&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a fact, it&rsquo;s biblical, get over it.<br>
Imagine a woman in charge - things are run on emotion only. If they&rsquo;re happy, ok, if it&rsquo;s 25% of their life from 13 - 45 or so, they are miserable and you will be too, if they are in command of ANY situation.<br>
I love women, but hate feminists. Woman can be the cornerstone to a family, as well as the most devious and most disruptive person in any given situation.<br>
These whacked out women who are turning to Islam are getting what they wanted, and if they try to turn away, they will legally be stoned to death, or worse.<br>

<p>European values made Christianity great, not the other way around.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I beg to differ.</p>
<p>In the Greek and Roman Empires, slavery, murder, torture and pedophilia were completely legal and encouraged. Yes, they had some nice buildings, poetry, etc, but legalized torture and child rape are not the signs of greatness&hellip;quite the opposite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As European Christians struggled to rebuild civilization in the dark ages, most of what they built was destroyed by the Norse Viking invaders. The Vikings raped, murdered, burned, and pillaged everything in their sights. They would destroy monasteries, sell little boys and girls to  Arabs as sex slaves, horrifically torture people (tearing their arms and legs off, pulling their lungs out while still alive, etc). The list goes on. </p>
<p>You really cannot mean what you say. Christianity saved Europe from ignorance and savagery. Read up on your history. </p></p>

		<p>&#8220;Well, quite a lot, it turns out, including Islam&rsquo;s latest surprise convert, Tony Blair&rsquo;s sister-in-law Lauren Booth. Broadcaster and journalist Booth, 43, says she now wears &hellip; hijab head covering whenever she leaves home, prays five times a day and visits her local mosque &lsquo;when I can&rsquo; &hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>If the rest of these women are anything like Lauren Booth then they will be no great loss to Western Civilisation. Booth is an  appallingly mediocre journalist, writing for a hack newspaper. She is also a shameless celebrity-style self-publicist, eager to get any media publicity that&rsquo;s going, a real drama queen from a loony actor family who&rsquo;s hooked on celebrity. She seems only to be employed by the media because of the fact that she is Cherie Blair&rsquo;s sister. Her article in last week&rsquo;s UK Daily Mail on her conversion to Islam was absolutely filled with the biggest load of tripe I&rsquo;ve ever read. It seemed to be the kind of thing written by an immature 16 year-old who&rsquo;d fallen love for the first time, full of flowery language such as &#8220;It was a Tuesday evening, and I sat down and felt this shot of spiritual morphine, just absolute bliss and joy.&rsquo;&#8221;, and this absolute crackpot goes on to say near the end of the article, quite seriously, &#8220;there&rsquo;ll be no more wild nights out with me baring my breasts in public&#8221;, which seemed to please her two children who must be hoping that their lunatic mother is going to grow up at long last. And all this joy and love for Islam from a woman who admitted she&rsquo;d only read the first 60 pages of the Quran. What happens if she don&rsquo;t like the ending? </p>
<p>These women are single and choose to stay in their Western nations and embrace a kind of Islam-lite that allows them to enjoy the trappings of the Western world without having to face the harsh realities of life in a strict Islamic society. Perhaps a tongue-lashing from a strict Ayatollah would bring these fantasists crashing down to earth with a loud bang. Of course, Islam is happy to have these poster-girls who make for great publicity &amp; aid its ongoing colonisation of the West through naive white women converting to Islam. I&rsquo;d lay a pound to a penny though that before very long Lauren Booth will have moved on, sold her colourful collection of hijabs &amp; adopted some new fad.</p>

		<p>I think there are a few things going on here with this phenomenon of middle-class white women converting to Islam. First of all, women tend to align with the winners, with the group(s) that are sanctioned by the mainstream and seem to be gaining ground. Christianity is not sanctioned (rather, it&rsquo;s relentlessly attacked and weakened), but Islam is. So, these women who are converting are early adopters, in a sense; they put their fingers to the wind and saw that the UK is becoming a pro-Islam society and that this is deemed perfectly acceptable, even desirable by &#8220;respectable&#8221; society. Their own eyes probably tell them that the demographic future also belongs to Islam.</p>
<p>In these conversions, there is also likely an element of rejecting emasculated British men. Feminism and identity politics have relentlessly sought the demonization and disenfranchisement of the average British man. They&rsquo;ve largely succeeded. Even though most British women will not betray their religion and race, an increasing number at the margins opt for the clear sex roles and &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; that Islam offers. Besides all of this, the atheism and materialism prevalent in the West can be rather vacant, and since Christianity is not considered a legitimate option, some fill that void with Islam.</p>
<p>Then there are just the nutjobs who think Islam is pro-feminism and the West &#8220;oppresses women&#8221; (on the contrary, nowhere on Earth, in history, has ever treated women better: they are an officially privileged class). In other words, your typical leftist insanity and so-called logic. Anything anti-Western is met with enthusiastic aplomb: in its way, this is the religious analog of the middle-class college kid who chooses to adopt a black child, or teach in a black school, and so forth.</p>
<p>I noticed that the commenters have already brought up most of what I discussed. Good comments, all!</p>

		<p>I submit that all European and American Whites who convert to Islam are hastening the day when once again our nations shall convulse in fire, terror and blood because of open warfare with Islam.  Our ancestors at Tours and Lepanto understood the stakes better than we do today, perhaps because they were facing a direct military frontal assault.</p>
<p>In modern times, we are facing an assault that is equally deadly, but because it is carried out under the guise of integration  and immigration we seem powerless to stop it, indeed many of us refuse to even recognize the problem exists.  As a result Europe has 50 million Muslims in her midst and more pouring in every day.  </p>
<p>Those 50 million Muslims are adherents of a supremacist religion that is dedicated to the destruction or subjugation of every other form of religious and political thought on the planet - and that&rsquo;s not just supposition, it is a matter of explicit foundational doctrine.  </p>
<p>Tolerance of Islam is equivalent to giving aid and comfort to the enemies of your people and culture.  It encourages the enemy, and weakens us.  Islam is very much the enemy of Western civilization, regardless of your own personal religious affiliations or lack thereof.  It is a dagger aimed straight at our hearts and souls, and those who convert to Islam are helping add muscle to thrust that dagger home.</p>
<p>I cannot conceive of how to post the above information in a gentler or more politically correct fashion.  If we have reached the point that even discussing the unpleasant realities that face us is forbidden, we clearly no longer have the courage or the will to preserve our culture and people.  You have reached a crucial turning point, Western Man - will you continue to pride yourself on your enlightened tolerance of your own destruction, or will you stand up and oppose it?<br>
