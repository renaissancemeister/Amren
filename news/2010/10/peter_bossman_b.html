<h1>Peter Bossman Becomes Mayor of Piran: Slovenia Elects Its 1st Black Mayor</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, October 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Slovenia elected its first black mayor on Sunday, an immigrant from Africa known as the &#8220;Obama of Piran,&#8221; the town where he lives.</p>
<p>In fact, Peter Bossman, a Ghana-born physician, could be the first black mayor elected anywhere in his region of Europe.</p>
<p>Bossman, who settled in this tiny Alpine nation in the 1970s to study medicine in what was then known as Yugoslavia, won a runoff election in the coastal town of Piran with 51.4 percent of votes, defeating Dr. Tomaz Gantar, the outgoing mayor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Slovenia, a country of 2 million people is located near Italy, Austria and Croatia, and is a member of European Union and NATO. The vast majority of Slovenians are white, and there are few immigrants. The few blacks who are seen in the country tend to be tourists.</p>
<p>Vlado Miheljak, a political analyst, said the vote in Piran was a test about whether Slovenia was &#8220;mature enough to elect a nonwhite political representative.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the black population of Slovenia is too large.  This appears to be a very minor aberration.  I would be more concerned about the immigration problems in France and Great Britian before I would worry about Slovenia.  </p>

<p>You know what will happen next?  The Ghanaian &#8216;mayor&rsquo; will encourage more blacks to arrive.  Others will hear about it and think it&rsquo;s a good place to go.  In 15 years, there will be race riots in the streets like in Paris because the local white &#8216;racists&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be giving the goodies fast enough.</p>

		<p>As a Serb, I must say: GOOD. Tito &amp; Kardelj, president &amp; vp of ex-YU &amp; both Slovenes, essentially ran ex-YU for the benefit of industrializing Slovenia, so let the Slovends be &#8216;mature enough&rsquo; ie: totally foolish to accept this Black BossMan. Gross. Let them rot. Contrast their toxic failed ethnicity feminized by Catholicism to ORTHODOX SERBIA where people nearly overthrew their govt recently after it failed to force homosexuality on us. We will NEVER accept Gays, let alone the Dark Sons of Cain!</p>

		<p>From Slovenia to Maine the white world has gone completly mad.  There must be a tremendous amount of lead leaching into the water from old soldered pipe joints.  Perhaps we should change the expression from &#8220;mad as a hatter&#8221; to &#8220;mad as a Caucasion&#8221;.</p>

		<p>If you read the original article He doesnt even speak fluent Slovakian -</p>
<p>&#8220;Bossman was nicknamed after President Barack Obama, the first African American to hold that office in the U.S. But he was criticized for not speaking fluent Slovene, the nation&rsquo;s official language&#8221;.</p>

		<p>How come electing a non-white is considered &#8220;mature&#8221; by Mr Miheljak? I don&rsquo;t understand it. I&rsquo;ve heard this line before from liberals but I am always flabbergasted to explain their thought.</p>
<p>Can anyone, perhaps a liberal by chance reading amren, inform me what strikes them as societally mature about electing a demographic outsider to public office?</p>

		<p>The Slovenes need to gain some race realism, and soon, if they want to keep their nation and survive as a people. As it is, they have drank the Kool-aid of multiculturalism and are heading down the same self-destructive path as the rest of Europe.</p>

		<p>Alot of white nationalists are concerned about an event like this.  Not me.</p>
<p>Calling him the Obama of Piran is apt.  Obama is doing a stellar job, in the US, of making sure another black person isn&rsquo;t even considered for generations to come.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that he is single handedly responsible for corrupt blacks being tossed out of politics, perhaps permanently, and shattering the unholy alliance of identity groups known as the democratic party.  To be blunt, blacks, gays, communists, felons, mestizos, etc. are no longer willing to work together and will only support their own.  Blacks will ONLY vote for black candidates&hellip;..candidates who have no chance of winning because nobody else will vote for them.</p>
<p>Slovenia will get its own little taste of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  No longer will opinions about such things be based of white ethnocentrism but on experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a GOOD thing&hellip;..especially when a nation is still overwhelmingly white.</p>

		<p>Absolutely reviling.  First Russia gets their first black mayor, and now SLOVENIA!?  What has happened to Western society?  Are there not enough good Slovenians to run for office, that the people of Piran have to elect a black man from Ghana?</p>
<p>I just got Patrick Buchanan&rsquo;s book, &#8220;Death of the West,&#8221; yesterday, and I have already read nearly half of it.  It is a very good and informative read, and even though Mr. Buchanan is not quite a racialist, he is only a couple notches short.  (For example he does state that continued non-white immigration will forever imperile America, but in the same chapter says that anyone can become a good American, simply that most non-whites will not attempt to).  Anyway, he presents some frightening statistics.  With declining birthrates among whites people worldwide, and exploding Third World populations, our time to reverse the situation is running out.  The fact that a town in Slovenia has just elected a black mayor, shows perfectly the sort of world we are living in, and the sort of world we can expect in the future.</p>
<p>Those of you who are old and nearing death, you are the lucky ones.  You have lived most of your life in a sensible, peaceful, civilized society.  The younger generation, myself included, will suffer the horrific world which, day by day, seems more inevitably to be our future.  Its already bad, it will only get worse before it gets better, if it ever does.  And we will have to bear children, knowing what sort of near-Armageddon they will have to face.</p>

<p>Note that racial marxist only think it&rsquo;s &#8220;mature&#8221; for whites to vote against themselves. For non-whites it&rsquo;s unthinkable.</p>

<p><br>
Peter Bossman, a candidate for the centre-left Social Democrats, poses for the photograph in the Slovenian Adriatic town of Piran, during the second round of country�s local elections, on October 24, 2010. Bossman (54), the Ghana-born doctor, won today at the run-off at local elections in Piran, becoming the first ever black mayor in Slovenia. Running as a candidate for the centre-left Social Democrats, Bossman, married to a Croat doctor and with two daughters, came to Slovenia in the early 80&rsquo;<br>

		<p>@9,</p>
<p>I think this is your &#8216;liberal&rsquo; explanation:</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Slovenia, a country of 2 million people is located near Italy, Austria and Croatia, and is a member of European Union and NATO. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>I would not be at all surprised if one of the requirements for being a member of the elitist country club known as the EU is destruction of ethnic homogenity.  Touting this as a great thing and an &#8216;act of maturity&rsquo; is simply letting the master know you are following his ideal.</p>
<p>The question is why this would be seen as a good thing.</p>
<p>And the answer is inherent to the notion of &#8216;Bowling Alone&rsquo; and demographic islanding as victim psychology whereby the first thing that people give up on the hellish road to losing self-determination is _empathy_ for whether &#8216;their&rsquo; homeland persists in a multicult miasma.</p>
<p>The more alien, the less affinity of co-identification and pride, the more criminal the more revulsion as inwards driven separation from reality.</p>
<p>And the less participation in overall civic actions which can become ever more severe in their consequences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a casual thing people.  This is not &#8216;experimental&rsquo; like trying marijuana in college.  It&rsquo;s a socially engineered agenda.  To take away power from those who use it wisely (yes, that&rsquo;s right, sometimes the best thing about having control is just letting it ride easy&hellip;) and giving it to those who will use it ruthlessly.  Because someone who is attached to their empowerment lives in terror of losing it.  And that&rsquo;s a manipulable fear.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The vast majority of Slovenians are white, and there are few immigrants. The few blacks who are seen in the country tend to be tourists.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Boo Hoo.  I look at that photo and my eyes try to exclude the dark figure in his ill fitting sports coat and gangster glasses, to concentrate on the flawless Mediterranean architecture and beautiful clock tower in the background.</p>
<p>That is our heritage.  That is what someone who was not black _built_.  That is something which no amount of golf courses, electric cars, online shopping or airports can improve upon.</p>
<p>And we are giving it away for nothing.</p>

		<p>I lived in Slovenia for a few years.  I can say fairly reliably several things about this situation.  Note; In my years there, I only saw ONE half black man there.  I assumed he was a student, but he may have been this man&rsquo;s son!  </p>
<p>Regardless of the following criticisms, I have a great deal of affection for Slovenia and the Slovenian people.</p>
<p>1. Slovenia is far more nationalistic and full of ethnic pride than the most conservative American. They are crazy with it.  As former oppressed subjects of the Austrian Habsburg Empire, they are fiercely proud of themselves.  But they also share characteristics common among ethnic groups that have endured historic oppression.</p>
<p>2. Slovenes and their government counter their faults and errors by focusing on U.S. &#8220;hypocracies.&#8221;  Their state television station constantly shows films, often made in Hollywood, that show America in its worst light.  This is calculated to make Slovenes feel superior.  They talk about how wonderful their country is insessantly.  The most often quip I heard there was &#8220;But we can walk on our streets at night.&#8221;  The election of a &#8220;safe&#8221; black allows them to participate in the &#8220;Obama Phenomena&#8221; (they are socialists who only see U.S. politics in the tradtional right/left struggle between facists and communists).  This election allows them to feel smug at the same time, because they can say &#8220;look how mature we are,&#8221; when what has happened was not really that much.  It isn&rsquo;t as if this man just arrived from Kenya or Zimbabwe.  Slovenia hasn&rsquo;t begun to fill up with refugees from Africa yet, but I predict that this election will attract them and the Slovenes will soon face what France and England are facing today.  To bad, they do have a beautiful culture and land, and distinctly attractive people.</p>
<p>3. Since joining the EU, Slovenia has had to begin to seem in line with Larger EU policy.  Slovenes are terribly short-sighted people, used to the government taking care of important decsicions for them, and the Habsburgs before that.  Their Achilles Heel will allow eventual dillution of them.  After all, it is a country half the size of Switzerland, and a crossroads in Europe, situation at the entranc to Western Europe from the Balkans.  Herion going to Europe is trafficked through Slovenia, although other routes through Poland have no doubt delveloped.</p>
<p>4. The few real intellectuals I met there each said this of Slovenes, &#8220;Little Country, Little Minds.&#8221;  Slovene are mostly concerned with their personal comforts, their pride, and their vacations to that very seaside on the Adriatic.  They think they are showing the world how to be, and will speak of their supiority in their gostilnas and homes.  But when they allowed Gypsies into their schools about six years ago, they quickly reverted back to the old way when the Gyspie kids started beating up the Slovenian children, which started immediately.  Slovenes like to do things like this, but have no qualms about reverting back to Yugoslavia like policing when it hits them hard enough in the face.</p>
<p>5.  Neighbors like the Serbs, hold a grudge, while living inside and side by side with Slovenes.  It was Slovenia that began the seperation of Yugoslavia and Slovenes work harder than Serbs and have long prospered better, since they were not dominated by the Ottoman Turks for 500 years.  The Catholic/Orthodox schism is very noticible in &#8220;Highdukes&#8221; post on this page.  I went to a Serbian Orthodox service in Ljublijana, Slovenia, just to try to understand Serbs better.  Beautfiul church, beautiful service, incredibly singing, more reminescent of Pagan Greece and anything alse, but quite &#8220;Fado&#8221; like as well.  Examples can be found on Utube by a Serb singer named &#8220;Divna.&#8221;  It is worth the time to find.  The Serb&rsquo;s soul, like many a Christian&rsquo;s, is a contradiction of racial/ethic superiorty/ineriorty complexes, and a long and undeserved oppression, combined with a double oppression/Habsburg betrayal that led to the first world war.</p>
<p>For more insight into the history of this region, I recommend Robert Kaplan&rsquo;s &#8220;Balkan Ghosts,&#8221; to begin.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s not the mayor of Slovenia, which is a country, but of a small town of 17,000 people. It&rsquo;s a much smaller venue so anomalies like this can take place. It&rsquo;s easier to feel broadminded when there are so few non-whites and they&rsquo;re  not in a position to get pushy, thus are not very threatening. He&rsquo;s their mascot.  </p>

		<p>Poster #12 hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it on the ground. It cannot be hidden anymore.</p>
<p>Blacks and latinos have no love for each other at all.  Asians have no love for either group.  The gays have made their own bloc.  </p>
<p>The rainbow coalition fell apart * after * they took control of the U&rsquo;s. Gov&rsquo;t. (White house, federal gov&rsquo;t, both houses of congress)  </p>
<p>What did they learn about each other?  That they all have divergent goals and CANNOT stand each other.  The Republicans have an opening to get back in now, but many white Americans no longer trust them either.  That&rsquo;s what this Tea Party stuff is reflecting.</p>
<p>The clueless liberals still act like the glue that holds it all together, but their influence is waning.  Now we are entering the era of group identity politics and competition.  (La Raza vs Black Panthers vs Asian surge)</p>
<p>Too bad we whites have already ceded more than half our land and most of our cities to the various groups who want to erase our culture and promote their own cultures here over ours.  By 2050, there will no longer a unified country.  You know this is true.  Are you planning for that for your kids and grandkids so at least they will spared the worst of the dislocations and disruptions?</p>

I don&rsquo;t anything about the situation in Slovenia but I can comment about Russia.  I was just reading the book<br>
&#8220;The New Cold War&#8221; .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Cold-War-Putins-Russia/dp/0230614345/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288143184&amp;sr=1-7" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/New-Cold-War-Putins-Russia/dp/0230614345/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1288143184&sr;=1-7</a></p>
<p>What the author basically asserts is that Putin is systematically declaring war on civil society in Russia.  Political opponents face violence by thugs or forcible incarceration in psychiatric wards.  NGO&rsquo;s are systematically closed down for lack of tax compliance.  Journalists who report on sensitive issues conveniently die.  Civil society in Russia appears to be under active assault by the state, to a degree that makes China seem like a liberal and relatively democratic country by comparison.  No one is immune even rich and powerful tycoons who appear to threaten Putin&rsquo;s power are &#8220;run out of Dodge&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why they elected this black man in Russia.  I think it&rsquo;s a way of telling Putin and his whole FSB/KGB dominated state &#8220;screw you&#8221;.  A form of protest in order to stick it to &#8220;the man&#8221; or in this case &#8220;the Czar&#8221;.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t anything about the situation in Slovenia but I can comment about Russia. I was just reading the book<br>
&ldquo;The New Cold War&rdquo; .</i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Cold-War-Putins-Russia/dp/0230614345/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1288143184&amp;sr=1-7" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/New-Cold-War-Putins-Russia/dp/0230614345/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1288143184&sr;=1-7</a></p>
<p><i>&#8220;What the author basically asserts is that Putin is systematically declaring war on civil society in Russia.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>Personally, I would very much treat this book with immediate suspicion on account of the fact that the author bears a Jewish surname and PM Putin has sworn to clamp down hard on the country&rsquo;s oligarchs of whom a very high percentage happen to be of Jewish origin.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree he is not a man to be messed with and has no time for Marxist Liberal Political Correctness do-gooders whether within or in the form of foreign NGOs which is an absolutely imperative stance to take for the preservation of Russia and her indigenous people.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Political opponents face violence by thugs or forcible incarceration in psychiatric wards. NGO&rsquo;s are systematically closed down for lack of tax compliance. Journalists who report on sensitive issues conveniently die.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I remember reading about political associates and opponents under two former American presidents who also disappeared and/or met with very convenient accidents. </p>
<p>People in America and the West, but most predominately White people, are being persecuted via employment dismissal, character assassination, arrest and trial on bogus charges and actually imprisoned for speaking out about the removal of <b>their</b> human/civil rights and the damage being done by Marxist Liberals to them, their families and homelands, and you dare to criticise Putin and Russian politics.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Civil society in Russia appears to be under active assault by the state, to a degree that makes China seem like a liberal and relatively democratic country by comparison.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I take it, you believe free speech and freedom of choice/association in America and the West in general, is not under assault from governments. Once again, you need to bring your global affairs awareness up to speed Yellow Man or at the very least, remove your blinkers.  What about active assault by the state on the civil society in Islamic countries such Iran and Saudi Arabia, for instance?  Well!   </p>
<p>What about China&rsquo;s handling of their Muslim problem in their Mongolian border territory!  Well! The Chinese most definitely don&rsquo;t believe in wishy-washy human rights considerations being awarded to the likes of terrorists and anarchists.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;No one is immune even rich and powerful tycoons who appear to threaten Putin&rsquo;s power are &ldquo;run out of Dodge&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>And by way of contrast, Obama has sent White businesses all over America to the wall recently by removing government contracts  and channeling them instead into non-White enterprises, in a blatant display of naked racial discrimination.  Have you any comments to make on that topic!  Well!   </p>
<p>It is equally plausible to conclude that he also believed that White businessmen might pose a threat to <b>his&gt;/b&gt; power.</b></p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s easy to see why they elected this black man in Russia. I think it&rsquo;s a way of telling Putin and his whole FSB/KGB dominated state &ldquo;screw you&rdquo;. A form of protest in order to stick it to &ldquo;the man&rdquo; or in this case &ldquo;the Czar&rdquo;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Nonsense!  The reason they elected a Black is because Slovenia has only recently become another satellite state of the EU which means the Marxist Liberal multicult brainwashing propaganda machine along side the usual White guilt-tripping routine, is already at work there.</p>
<p>We know that elements of the White races have a fatal flaw and that flaw is altruism towards outgroups.  Fortunately, the White elements inhabiting the West who have already undergone 55 or more years of this imposed Frankfurt School-concocted agenda, are now the ones waking up.  In time, Slovenia and other former Soviet-controlled countries that have recently joined that well-known alternative version of Sovietism, ie, the EU, will do the same.  </p>

		<p>I work on a  NATO camp here in Afghanistan and the Slovenian army is one of those that are here and there are NO blacks in it nor are there any blacks in the Italian or Spanish army here. At another camp in the mountains the Italians have one apparently black female with them and she is EXTREMELY attactive and well built..I have no explanation for that.</p>
