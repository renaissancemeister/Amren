<h1>Rangel Without Lawyer, Ethics Trial Date Uncertain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Margasak, Washington Post, October 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The scheduled Nov. 15 start of Rep. Charles Rangel&rsquo;s ethics trial is in jeopardy, because the former Ways and Means Committee chairman no longer has a defense team.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat and lawyers for the Washington firm of Zuckerman Spaeder have parted company, according to people inside and outside Congress familiar with the breakup. They spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday because they were not authorized to discuss the development publicly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rangel has paid the law firm more than $1.4 million from his campaign account, according to Federal Election Commission records.</p>
<p>If Lofgren and other committee members insist on going forward Nov. 15, it would be difficult for Rangel to find an attorney who could catch up with an investigation that began in the summer of 2008. Rangel could decide to represent himself.</p>
<p>The development also could affect the way ethics committee lawyers, acting as prosecutors, present their case to an ethics committee panel that will act as judges.</p>
<p>Committee attorneys have been lining up witnesses, expecting to face experienced defense lawyers who are familiar with every aspect of the case. The committee lawyers might present a more simplified case with fewer witnesses if Rangel represents himself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In attempts to negotiate a plea bargain with ethics committee attorneys, Rangel admitted to some ethical lapses. Republicans on the ethics committee rejected any deal, saying it was offered too late.<br>
