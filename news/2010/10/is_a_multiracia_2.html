<h1><a href="/ar/1992/02/index.html#cover">Is a Multiracial Nation Possible?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, February 1992</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of all the ways in which a nation defines itself, few are more important than what it teaches its children about itself. In the history classes of its public schools, a nation retells its own story and instills a national identity in the minds of young citizens. In today&rsquo;s America, where competing racial, cultural, and linguistic claims now make it nearly impossible even to speak of national identity, questions about history have become a struggle for the possession of America&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>The multicultural, multiperspective history that has arisen from this struggle is not merely a departure from the history America has always taught its children. It may be the first time that a nation has abandoned the single identity of its origins and set out deliberately to adopt multiple national identities.</p>
<p>Significantly, the understanding by many non-whites of multicultural history is entirely different from that of whites. For whites, the central concepts are &#8220;inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;pluralism.&#8221; American history is to be rewritten so that racial and cultural perspectives that were once &#8220;ignored&#8221; or &#8220;neglected&#8221; will get equal treatment. For many non-whites, however, multicultural history is merely a step on the way to an explicitly racial, Afro-centric or Hispanic history. Their goal is separation rather than inclusion.</p>

</div><p>The &#8220;conservative&#8221; view is that explicitly racial histories are illegitimate. America, it is argued, must be united by a common history, and exclusionist histories will disunite us. This position is logically correct; exclusionist histories are divisive. But as we shall see, the &#8220;conservative&#8221; position is wrong  &mdash;  practically, emotionally, and even morally. America is <em>already</em> disunited by race, and no approach to history can change that. Just as it would be impossible to use the same history book in both France and England, it is impossible to write a single American history that satisfies, white, black, Indian, Hispanic, and Asian.</p>
<p><b>Schooling as Assimilation</b></p>
<p>The purpose of American public education has never been simply to impart knowledge. One of its central goals has been to make children into Americans. American schools fly the American flag and students pledge allegiance to it. The central events of history are from the American past. The most glorious achievements are American achievements. There is nothing odd about that. Every nation gives its children a national education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, American schools have had an even more explicitly nation-building purpose than others because of the need to assimilate immigrants. John Quincy Adams wrote that immigrants &#8220;must cast off their European skin, never to resume it.&#8221; Horace Mann argued that &#8220;a foreign people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannot be transformed into the full stature of American citizens merely by a voyage across the Atlantic.&#8221; One of the strongest motives for building public schools was, therefore, the need to make <em>Americans</em> out of Europeans.</p>
<p>Europeans weren&rsquo;t going to be made into Americans by teaching them about the contributions of Africans, Mexicans and Indians. The old, standard history united Americans because it had a coherent purpose and a single voice. It emphasized one point of view and ignored others. To put it bluntly, it was history about white people for white people.</p>
<p>This history served the country well, so long as the population was overwhelmingly white, and the two traditional minorities  &mdash;  blacks and Indians  &mdash;  did not have voices. All this changed, beginning in the 1960s. The civil rights movement gave voices to blacks and Indians, and changes in immigration laws brought a massive influx of non-whites. It was the end of a certain kind of America.</p>

</table><p>Non-whites began to complain about a version of history that left them out. The nation-building history that had bound Europeans into a single people had not bound whites and non-whites into a single people. &#8220;Multicultural&#8221; history was therefore to be a broader, more inclusive history that would give every American his rightful share of America&rsquo;s past. At the same time, &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; history would keep blacks and Hispanics in school and stop them from dropping out at ever-increasing rates.</p>
<p><b>Squaring the Circle</b></p>
<p>Something that well-meaning whites did not understand is that an &#8220;inclusive&#8221; history  &mdash;  one that would be all things to all people  &mdash;  is impossible. History has winners and losers, and they see the same events with different eyes. At the same time, virtually every non-white group sees the conflicts of the past as struggles with whites, so multicultural history becomes a collection of perspectives that are often not merely non-white but anti-white.</p>
<p>How, for example, is a multicultural history to treat the discovery and settlement of North America by Europeans? The old history called it a triumphant advance for civilization. But for Indians, the same historical events are an unending sequence of defeats and disasters. Does a multicultural textbook call this a triumph or a disaster or both or neither?</p>
<p>What about the Spanish-American War? At the time, it was thought a glorious success because it added huge chunks to the American West. But was it instead, an imperialist atrocity? Are today&rsquo;s school children to rejoice that California is part of America or are they to weep over the stolen birthright of their Hispanic brothers?</p>

</table><p>Slavery poses a similar riddle. Blacks want to make it the centerpiece of their history, and in many ways it is. For nearly 300 years, most American blacks were slaves, and virtually everything that blacks did or thought was circumscribed by slavery. Today, it is still the centerpiece of black history, because it excuses failure and can be used to extract benefits from whites.</p>
<p>For whites, though, slavery is a minor historical event. Except for the Civil War (which was set in motion and fought by whites) the course of the nation&rsquo;s history would hardly have been different if there had been no slavery. To give it a prominent place in white history is a transparent effort to manipulate the way that whites think about the present.</p>
<p>Once slavery is promoted to the status of unparalleled evil, much of the past becomes incomprehensible. Is George Washington <em>both</em> the Father of his Country <em>and</em> a wicked man because he owned slaves? Is Abraham Lincoln the storied savior of the Union or is he a fiend because he thought blacks were inferior and should be sent back to Africa?</p>
<p>Those of us who went to school when American history still had coherence are likely to learn about the new, multicultural history only by accident. One such accident is that this year is the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. A typical multicultural problem has thus spilled out of the classroom and gotten wider notice: Was Columbus a great explorer or was he a genocidal tyrant? Are we to celebrate half a millennium of European America or are we to hang our heads in shame? Or are we to do both?</p>
<p><b>Problems and Uncertainties</b></p>
<p>Multicultural histories, by their very nature, cannot answer these questions. And because they cannot, they present American history as a bundle of uncertainties, as a series of unsolved &#8220;problems.&#8221; Unlike the old history, which viewed the past with pride and the future with confidence, multicultural histories are diffident and perplexed. Unlike the old history, which at least gave white children a firm foundation for national identity, multicultural history says, in effect, that America has no identity. The only thing left to unite a multicultural America is geography.</p>
<p>One way to understand the impossible task that multicultural history has set itself is to imagine how one would write a school history book to be used in both France and Britain. How would it treat Napoleon? The very geography of London  &mdash;  Waterloo Station, Trafalger Square  &mdash;  is a monument to Englishmen who killed Frenchmen. Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb, Austerlitz station, and street names like Jena and Ulm all mark the pride the French take in their ancestors&rsquo; readiness to slaughter foreigners. A &#8220;multicultural&#8221; history book of the Napoleonic wars would be an absurdity, and everyone knows it. And yet, it would be no more absurd than the history books American children use today.</p>
<p>Non-whites have a much keener sense of their group interests than whites. They see very clearly that the future will have its winners and losers, just as history had them. Thus, while virtually every school district with a white majority is trying to square the circle by teaching a history that is everything to everyone, school districts with black majorities are beginning to replace the old &#8220;Euro-centric&#8221; curriculum with one that is openly &#8220;Afro-centric.&#8221; They are not interested in supplementing the traditional history with different points of view. They want a single, African point of view.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, where 92 percent of the public school students are black, history and social studies courses have been rewritten from an &#8220;African-American&#8221; perspective. New York&rsquo;s public schools recently authorized a curriculum revision based on an openly anti-white position paper drafted, in part, by the black-supremacist professor, Leonard Jeffries (see <a href="/ar/1991/10/index.html" target="jeffries" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>AR, October, 1991</b></a>). In California, school districts in heavily-black Oakland and East Palo Alto started the 1991/1992 school year <em>without social studies textbooks.</em> They decided to develop their own black-centered materials because they could find nothing suitable.</p>
<p>Private black schools have gone the farthest (see <a href="/ar/1992/02/index.html#sidebar" target="sidebar" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>sidebar</b></a>). Some reject America, and teach their pupils that they are the African diaspora. Many teach patent nonsense, claiming that the ancient Egyptians and even King Solomon were black. Nevertheless, even if some of their material is ridiculous, Afro-centric teachers have recognized something that white teachers have forgotten: History has a point of view; it cannot be all things to all people.</p>
<p><b>Building a Nation</b></p>
<p>Blacks, then, are learning the kind of history that whites once learned  &mdash;  a history that builds identity and certitude. White children are learning that every interpretation is valid, that nothing is certain, that their nation&rsquo;s past is all paradoxes and unsolved problems. Patriotism will not grow in the heart of a child who cannot look back with pride upon his nation&rsquo;s past. We have come a long way from schooling that made Europeans into Americans. We now make Americans into nothing at all.</p>
<p>Multicultural history is like affirmative action. Just as whites are to step aside to give hiring preferences to minorities, whites are to set aside their own point of view and study those of others. Non-whites, on the other hand, are free to promote their own interests and exclusionist histories.</p>
<p>Like affirmative action, multicultural history is possible only because the majority has abandoned its position at the center. If whites insisted on their own history as strongly as non-whites insist on theirs, the inevitability of separate histories would have been recognized long ago. Nor will whites be willing to forego their own history for ever. They will eventually realize that only they are studying a past with no answers and no certainties. They will eventually see that there <em>cannot</em> be one history that satisfies all. And they will begin to wonder whether there can be one nation that satisfies all.</p>

		<p>Diversity and multiculturism are just pet names for genocide. There is NOTHING good in immigration to white lands. <br>
Unless you think this is good:<br>
1. taking white jobs.<br>
2. taking white living space.<br>
3. taking white people as wives/husbands. Then bastardize their race.<br>
4. Immense crime and huge no go areas for white people.<br>
5. ALL Diversity and multiculturism is into white lands only.<br>
6. destroying white culture/religion through offending others.<br>
7. destroying white patriotism by banning them flags.</p>
<p>Many of this is covered in U.N charter on GENOCIDE!</p>

		<p>To state what I am sure many others here will affirm: Taylor&rsquo;s analysis remains accurate and relevant. </p>
<p>However, why do conservatives, including paleoconservatives, social conservatives, and race realists not vigorously blast the latest education proposals by Obama&rsquo;s Education Dept that will pour billions into cash-strapped school systems in order to propagate the racially-based lies of PC education?</p>
<p>Literature, history, social studies and the general conduct and procedure of teaching are all guided by PC-Third World primacy.</p>
<p>Obama and his crew are exposed on this. Yet the &#8220;Right&#8221; is silent. I truly believe they don&rsquo;t get it. They blab about teacher unions. A minor problem. </p>
<p>Curriculum and constraints on teachers who try to enforce common manners and discipline are the real problem. The term &#8220;Western&#8221; to the average college and high school grad in this nation of mediocrities is a geographic term, not a cultural term. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr.Taylor, use your valid assumptions and update your critique to the current threat in our classrooms.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Whitey, and I kept my finger in the dike today during a Multiracial Nation attack on my condominium building. </p>
<p>Some blacks were in the lobby looking at the For Sale flyers.  I started telling them how bad our building is: association fees too high, huge assessments on the way, rising property taxes, toxic mold in the walls, residents are always fighting each other over parking spaces, and possible embezzlement lawsuit against our board of directors for stealing our reserve funds, and that the owners who are selling are trying to trick people by not disclosing the true situation, and the prices should be $50,000 less.  I put on a good show, acting all mad about the situation and all oh-fended up en hee&rsquo;ah.</p>
<p>They looked at me with the most appreciative expressions, as though they were receiving some hidden White Peoples&rsquo; secret that will keep them out of trouble.  The left and didn&rsquo;t take any of the flyers with them.</p>
<p>Another Victory for White Humanity, and it was all a big, fat, juicy, delicious Lie!  Our building is close to wonderful, mostly because of how overwhelmingly White it is, and the few blacks we have don&rsquo;t cause trouble, yet.  Somehow, the all do a good job of &#8220;acting White.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was I wrong to lie in trying to keep the blacks away?  Deception is a time honored and long standing tactic in war, and we are in a Race War against the Diversity Curse.  Any White Women who are not robbed, raped, and murdered by visitors to those particular blacks, because those blacks won&rsquo;t be here, were saved my battle tactic.</p>
<p>Deception has its honorable uses, and White Gentile Christians need not be timid about using it. Our enemies are experts at it, and we should learn from them, because they have the most victories.</p>
<p>How many laws did I break? Wouldn&rsquo;t the NAACP just love to get its black hands on me!</p>
<p>I Transcended Diversity- I Embraced White Humanity- I Was Aware and Prepared, and obviously I Did the Right Thing, but our work is unfinished&hellip;<br>

&#8220;The only thing left to unite a multicultural America is geography.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
That and enough economic prosperity for John Q. to buy a wide variety of consumer products. Take away that prosperity   &mdash;   a more than hypothetical possibility in these times!   &mdash;   and all these newly-minted multicultural &#8220;Americans&#8221; will start FIGHTING each other over (whatever may be left of) the geography. Multicultural &#8220;Americans&#8221;&rsquo; and immigrants&rsquo; devotion to America is only pocket deep. Never forget: they don&rsquo;t like you, they only like your money. </p>
<p>Excellent essay. And the fact that Mr. Taylor had the vision to see all this back in 1992   &mdash;   when I for one was still wearing the Liberal 3-D glasses with the red and blue lenses that made the multicult look like a good idea   &mdash;   makes it all the more remarkable: not only insightful but prescient. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Western Voices&#8221;, a very good website, posted a very anti-white article from the &#8220;the Village Voice&#8221; website on its page yesterday to show how the left is getting afraid of growing white &#8220;racism&#8221;.  The piece is the most anti-white and vile thing I have ever read.  </p>
<p>Reading the comments has been the worst part.  I have posted some comments on there, and there are a good number of commenters who agree with me.  But far too many (both liberal and conservative) do not. And they still follow this blind idea that all races are the same.</p>
<p>It is times like this that I wonder what future this country has.  Hopefully these comments are just a reflection of the readership that follows &#8220;the Village Voice&#8221; website, and perhaps I should be thankful, in that case, of the percentage of white commenters on there who have sense. </p>
<p>Do whites have any pride left in their people?  I am sick of this sheepishness and stupidity.  We are becoming a Third World country for goodness sake.</p>
<p>Here is the piece right here&hellip;.please go and speak your mind like I did.  It takes two seconds to comment.  There is no moderating or anything. </p>

The answer is a simple &#8220;no&#8221;. You might as well ask if you can have  dry water.  </p>
<p>You can have a multi-racial <i>empire</i>; but a multi-racial <i>&#8220;nation&#8221;</i> is a contradiction in terms. It can exist only in the fantasies of an idealistic dreamer. </p>

		<p>I think that there are examples of multi-racial, multi-liguistic, multi-religious, multi-ethnic cultures and nations, but they usually have one very strong and dominant group, headed quite often by an authoritarian government that imposes a strong will over everyone. Yugoslavia was such a place? Gone now with all that means. Other examples include?</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the Spanish-American War? At the time, it was thought a glorious success because it added huge chunks to the American West. But was it instead, an imperialist atrocity? Are today&rsquo;s school children to rejoice that California is part of America or are they to weep over the stolen birthright of their Hispanic brothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That would have been the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, not the Spanish-American War of 1898! The latter war, which extended America&rsquo;s imperial hegemony over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines (the latter three of which were ceded to the United States by Spain, for $20 million), has had a very great deal to do with the eventual Hispanicization of the United States, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>The Democrats are now in the process of trying to rig Puerto Rico&rsquo;s voting, once and for all times, to bring that alien, Spanish-speaking island into the United States as a sovereign 51st state, on an equal footing with the existing fifty  &mdash;   which would make bilingualism and biculturalism official and permanent characteristics for the nation (if one, then, even could call it such, still) as a whole.</p>
<p>What the nation gained as an imperial world power in 1898 has been coming home to roost ever since, and especially since 1965. The &#8220;homeland&#8221; may well be on the very brink of having its face scalded, and permanently scarred, by a quick-order omelette that was thoughtlessly ordered up, in a moment of national hubris, under the likewise ill-fated President McKinley.</p>

		<p>A multi racial nation is NOT possible especially if it includes Afros.  In Atlantic City another young White man 22 years old was found lying on a pavement after having been shot in what appeared to be a robbery. He was a Russian student named Konstantin Kraev who has been working his second summer in AC and was planning to return home this week. He was walking another Russian student Ekaterina Chernobaeva 21 back to her apartment. He had offered to walk her home because the section of the city where her apartment is located is &#8220;very dangerous&#8221;. THe two had met at the beginning of the summer. The agency that handles the student work assignments introduced them because it turned out that they were from the same city in Russia.<br>
He went unidentified for several days until Ekaterina, unable to contact him, went to the ACPD. </p>

<p>I feel for the most part that the average White is a lost dark soul. They are so afraid of stating the truths about race and culture that they have become impotent imbeciles and are the reason that we are where we are today as a race. They bought into the propaganda like fish to water.</p>
<p>I only read WN sites and get the news articles that they post and read their comments. For me, that is what keeps my sanity in today&rsquo;s multiracial insane world. At least I can read comments that I can wholeheartedly agree with, plus knowing that there are a few of us Whites, who have the intelligence and common sense to know what the real agenda is, thereby giving me some hope for our future.  </p>
<p>Twenty or so years ago I never thought about what was happening to us as a race, or about politics, and didn&rsquo;t have a clue as to why or that we were being targeted as a race for extinction. I have a clearer perception now and have connected the dots, so to speak. </p>
<p>I also believed what we were taught in our churches and did not have a clue that the Church was also targeted and infiltrated a long time ago. I will never set foot in any of the MS churches of today nor give a dime to them. They are all for multi-racialism, saving the nonwhites of the world, worldly tolerance, and inter-racial marriages. It is completely contrary to the Bible. </p>
<p>I got sick of the MS media and so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show hosts who constantly bring up Hitler, the nazis, White &#8220;Supremacists&#8221;, slurring all us racists (meaning only racially aware Whites), and hate us &#8220;racists&#8221; to the core. </p>

		<p>Jared Taylor exagerated (as he often does&hellip;) when he stated that wars between Europeans make it impossible to have a common narrative in schoolbooks. German history schoolbooks have nothing offensive for a French, and I think the reverse is largely true. In fact, there is a Franco-German comitee aimed at helping to produce a common narrative for history schoolbooks. A French does not necessarily believe that justice was on the side of the army of Napoleon, even if he may have some kind of identication with it, as an Englishman does not necessarily believe that British behavior in Ireland was always so fine. In general, modern day pacifism spontaneously produces a distanciation with what is agressive and bellicist in the past behavior of one&rsquo;s nation. And after all Rightist and Leftist use the same history schoolbooks, which could be thought of as being not so easy : just think how different the French Revolution appears to a rightwinger and a leftwinger&hellip;    </p>

		<p>8-Jeddermann &#8220;Other examples include?&#8221; - I believe you could find other examples over time with just about every geographic space on the globe. The ones which come to mind first would be, The Soviet Union, the various groups throughout South America which over time broke into separate nations. Conflicts within Japan and China prior to the modern age. India, and then India and Pakistan. Within various multi-type nations today we have extreme ethnic and religious conflicts where the &#8220;nation&#8221; is held together by authoritarian means. The Middle East and the various strains of Islam. The Turks/Kurds/Iranians/Iraqis. The various European tribes (if viewing Europe as a whole) fighting each other for centuries yet remaining distinct and separate, at least until they decided to commit suicide by immigration.  Usually what we see is a stable nation when it has a dominate culture/race/ehtnicity.  Over time, as that dominance fades, we have warfare&hellip; Sri Lanka is a recent example.  It is coming to America as well, and it is only a matter of time.  So yes, there are many examples of nations which are multi-whatever, but which have a dominate group. As long as the dominance/status-quo remains, you have stability. Change the equation, and from what I see in human history, bloodshed and the breakup of nations occur.</p>

<p>I completely agree. The Spanish-American war was a needless and useless war for America. There was the ILLUSION of a cheap and easy victory over a weak opponent (no disrespect intended to the Spanish who fought bravely) but the longer term consequences were disastrous for America. I can make a strong case that war with Japan would have been avoided had America not taken over these places. God knows what Americans gained from their fifty years in the Phillippines and Puerto Rico has always been more trouble then it is worth. </p>

<p>You are very perceptive and have got it right. Back in the 70s  the PC, AA, Feminist, Open Door Immigration, South Africa bashing etc agendas were forced on us from above and both sides of politics as well the unions embraced it all.I am sure I was one of the very few people then who thought about this and said &#8220;we are being traitors to own own kind&#8221; I have been called un-Christian, a bigot etc for expressing my concerns.</p>
<p>As recently as the 1960s this country had a &#8220;whites only&#8221; immigration policy&#8221; and most people agreed with it. Also in the 1960s this country joined the war in Vietnam to help keep out the communists as well as the Yellow Peril!</p>
<p>As the Mosques and Temples go up in Australian towns and cities who now is being &#8220;un-christian&#8221;?</p>
<p>Most Australian police forces now have special Asian &amp; Middle Eastern crime task forces, so much for a harmonious multiracial society.</p>
<p>Perhaps Jarad Taylor should go for the top job in 2012!</p>

		<p>The black underclass does not want racial parity.  They want total power.  When Obama was elected, many thought they would receive free houses or other goodies, just as the ignorant of South Africa thought when Mandela took office.  They believed whitey would finally be put down and they would be on top.  <br>
When the Tea Party movement ramped up a few months after Obama&rsquo;s installment, many blacks apparently saw a shadowy white conspiracy in the mold of the Black Codes, Jim Crow, and the Republicans&rsquo; law-and-order and southern strategy campaigns.  Of course, a white backlash of sorts really is in existence.  Why wouldn&rsquo;t there be, with a President in office who ignores Black Panther anti-voting-rights antics and legally attacks white officials struggling to contain foreign encroachment?  <br>
I watched part of the One Nation rally that occurred in D.C.  Some of those present were union members who were compelled by their unions to attend.  Some were gays present to push their politics.  An awful lot of them were blacks, and the overall agenda appeared to be targeted at them  &mdash;  lots of black singers and dancers, well-known black celebs bemoaning the &#8220;racist&#8221; Tea Party and its supposed push toward a totalitarian regime.  <br>
Probably there is some truth to the blacks&rsquo; fears.  When whitey is pushed, he will push back.  If the ghetto will not stay contained, whitey will do what it takes to contain it.  And if even a black Prez acts like a white-hating racist, whites will not take it without a political fight.</p>

		<p>Good luck in trying to comment on Thrasher&rsquo;s &#8220;satire&#8221; at The Village Idiot.  I went back there to confirm, with pride, some idiot&rsquo;s accusation that I am a racist.  But oddly enough my non-case-sensitive validation code (even though I typed it exactly) is not working.  I think the comments are being moderated and certain posts like myself are being unofficially banned.  Now, some of Thrasher&rsquo;s pals (probably fellow Village Idiot workers) are coming on and saying this Anti-White diatribe of his was just a &#8220;satire&#8221; and what happened to you Crazy White People&rsquo;s sense of humor?  In the meantime, the &#8220;crazies&#8221; who came on to tell the author off outnumber the &#8220;sane&#8221; who &#8220;got the joke&#8221; by ten to one.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bother posting my satisfaction over the irony that the Whites Thrasher takes the biggest delight in bashing are the Baby Boomers.  Alas, I am considered part of that generation.  I&rsquo;m part of the Wonder Year Boomers who still in elementary and middle school when the Boomers filling the Love, Peace and Racial Justice Crowd at college were demonstrating for Snivel Rights.  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great, in a Schadenfreuden way, how their chickens are all coming home to roost at once for that bunch? We have the Minority Mortgage Meltdown that evaporated their private pension plans.  And the post-racial Hope and Change candidate they put in office while in the last gasps of White liberal self-righteousness signed off on a hate crimes bill that actively discriminates against any White people who dare to complain about Minority antics.  They aborted their children (and future grandchildren).  Now they have to worry about being mugged on the street by the rainbow thugs their tax dollars were used to raise, much less collecting their social security benefits. Useful idiots, indeed!</p>
<p>As far as a Multiracial Nation possible?  Maybe.  But not as we have it today.  I could see it working if educators stopped pushing Diversity Tolerance and implemented a radical language program (like in Europe).  I think the grand plan is an eventual Pan American Union (like the peeeuuuu, I mean EU) and it would be nice if the young are prepared for it by being fluent or proficient in French, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
<p> I could see it working if the Social Engineers of the Forces of Diversity were kept out of it and stopped shipping in alien races into settled populations.  In many cases, there is voluntary de facto segregation going on by ALL races.  I would encourage it.  The SW would be Mestizo.  The NW and heartland would be White and the the SE would be Negro.  Each area would have to be autonomous and not subject to being raided via taxation or regulated by other areas.  I am convinced that ALL areas would end up being better off, because they&rsquo;d have to sink or swim and would have no one but themselves to blame for failure.  </p>
<p>However, it cannot work by keeping the races in close proximity to each other.  You can&rsquo;t build a community with such animosity and distrust and no amount of scolding, lecturing, hectoring and shaming people are going to make them trust &#8220;the other.&#8221;  We need separate and inviolable racial and ethnic communities so people can be creative and produce.

		<p>Actually, I believe there can be multi-racial countries and societies.  Hong Kong and Singapore are both examples of such arrangement.</p>
<p>I think East Asians and whites in particular can get along and even complement one another.  Black Africans and mestizos are another matter altogether.  Both groups are simply too intellectually inferior (though there are of course many individual exceptions) to be fully assimilated into a modern technocracy, except as mainly manual laborers or agricultural workers.</p>
<p>We have the accumulated evidence of a half-century of the civil rights movement driving blacks in particular further out of the mainstream, a situation in which they find themselves in every other society on earth wherein they&rsquo;re found significant numbers.</p>

<p><i>Countries </i> and <i>societies,</i> perhaps. But the question was about a multi-racial NATION   &mdash;   which is a contradiction in terms and simply illogical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nation&#8221; comes from the Latin <i>nacere (birth, to be born), </i> and  (when properly used) it refers to a people of the same birth, people descended all from a common stock.</p>
<p>&#8220;A community of persons not constituting a state but bound by common descent, language, history, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A large group of people with common ancestry.&#8221; </p>
<p>The word has been greatly misused in America, especially by inarticulate, sub-literate morons like Dubya Bush. They do not make its misuse correct   &mdash;   however much Bush &#8220;misunderestimated&#8221; its propriety.  </p>
<p>I first became aware of the subtle distinctions, years ago, when I heard the brilliant, learned Abba Eban, (a classically trained Cambridge scholar and famed orator) being interviewed on television. He was asked some out-of-place question about &#8220;nation&#8221;, and he paused to correct the interviewer as to the proper distinctions between <i>nation, state,</i> and <i>country. </i>  In America, these distinctions are often abused and blurred. But that doesn&rsquo;t make them right.</p>
<p><br>
As for Hong Kong and Singapore: HK is not a country.  It is a part of China, and there is no question as to who is in charge there   &mdash;   the Chinese!  Not everyone is equal, though they may be tolerated and treated fairly. When the British left, people in lower-level civil service positions were allowed to keep their jobs until retirement (when they would be replaced with Chinese); but the heads of all agencies had to be Chinese.  In both HK and Singapore, there is a dominant majority group, although in Singapore its hegemony is a little more nuanced than in HK, but people still know who runs the show.</p>
<p>Yes, Singapore is a multi-racial STATE; but is is not a NATION.<br>
And Hong Kong is neither one. It seems they can exist when there is a dominant (and wise) group that keeps the fabric together. But when that dominant group weakens, they fall apart.</p>

		<p>When blacks are in the minority, most try to behave.  When they are in the majority, they behave the way they want to behave.<br>
 <br>
In his book, The Emerging Republican Majority, published in 1969, Kevin Phillips said that when the black population in a state or county is below ten percent it has little influence on the political behavior of the whites in that state.  When the black population exceeds ten percent, whites become nervous.  When the black population exceeds fifty percent, the control of those blacks becomes an issue nearly all whites agree on.<br>
 <br>
There were always a few blacks in the schools I attended.  They never caused problems.  Since then I have talked to people who taught in public schools where the vast majority were black.  There were many problems. </p>

How about the States with our silos and nuclear reactors, military bases, etc.? OUR ancestors built and fought for ALL the States, not just a few in the NW, and we are willing to give it all away?

<p>Abraham Lincoln is a fiend. Not because of his view on blacks. But because of his bullying of  the Southern states. His marxist, unconstitutional war. Alot of America&rsquo;s troubles started with Lincoln. And, we are still paying the price. Lincoln was a tyrant who attacked civillians in his own country and waged a godless  and immoral war.

<p>I used to often read Uhuru Guru of South Africa&rsquo;s blog until his identity was revealed and he was &#8220;arrested  on trumped up charges regarding an alleged offence dating back to 1993. His door was ripped off, his wife was not allowed to make calls, his children&rsquo;s cell phones were confiscated, his little daughters were ripped out of their beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, the following is about the Uhuru Guru, March 16th 2010:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A South African lawyer and dissident blogger critical of the ANC-led government has been found dead in the men&rsquo;s bathroom of a local police station, allegedly from a self-inflicted gun shot&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Western Press?  Silent. Investigation?  Suicide in the Police Station.  Case Closed&hellip;.Because he&rsquo;s White.  Got it?  BECAUSE HE&rsquo;S WHITE.</p>
<p>And these days White lives matter nothing to the Western Press or Western governments.</p>
<p>Yet when Stephen Biko died in police custody, he was called a &#8216;martyr of the anti-apartheid movement&rsquo; and his funeral was attended by over 10,000 people, including numerous ambassadors and other diplomats from the United States and Western Europe. </p>
<p>As for ignorant blacks in S. Africa, their lives have changed little, none of the promises made to them kept, their rage and anger vented on Whites, sanctioned by the ANC.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald is not wrong when he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger. Loss of political power means murder and mayhem directed against Whites by minorities with deep historical grudges&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s because Germany, like many other European nations and the USA, has become so PC regarding education that its textbooks have been &#8220;sanitized&#8221; as have those read by our children here in the USA.  Do you suppose a school history book in Germany around 1914 would have been palatable to the French?  Even way back when I was a college student (I&rsquo;m a Baby-Boomer, too), the leftists were infiltrating the writing of college texts on American History. I wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to read one now at all because I may lose my lunch. Who tells the truth about the War Between the States any longer?  Does anyone bother to point out that Lincoln was a racist, a political opportunist and a liar who started the ball rolling with regard to the unlimited power of the Federal leviathan?  The only positive thing I can say about him is that, had he lived and succeeded in moving all the Blacks to Liberia or somewhere else in Africa, I, too, may worship at the feet of his statue in his temple in Washington.</p>
<p>As I watch some of the White backlash in this country, I am forced to wonder still if Whites will ever be willing to fight to salvage what we have left of the heritage that we built for ourselves here and in which we once took the greatest pride.  Will we wake up?  Although there are those frequent visitors to AmRen who have warned us that we will have to fight (literally), I think too many Whites have been lulled into some false sense of security from which they one day may wake up dead.

		<p>As far as Singapore being a multiracial society, from Wikipedia http://tiny.cc/89y1d: </p>
<p>Singapore is a multicultural country with a majority population of Chinese immigrants, with substantial Malay and Indian minorities.  Various Chinese linguistic groups formed 74.2% of Singapore&rsquo;s residents, Malays 13.4%, Indians 9.2%, while Eurasians, Arabs and other groups formed 3.2%.</p>
<p>Singapore is overwhelmingly Asian - hardly qualifying as multiracial. And with nearly 75% of its residents being ethic Chinese, want to bet which group really dominates there? To me, this portrayal of Singapore as a multiracial paradise is just more liberal propaganda. </p>

<p>Hi, I am also an old ZASUCKS reader. It has gone through a few incarnations, now known as boerboel1.wordpress.com (warning: the language used is not for the faint-hearted! All the conservative White South Africans reflect their daily fears and stress on this site).</p>
<p>A more neutral blog (still going straight into the heart of the matter, but less emotive) is this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>It might however take a few days reading for foreigners to find their way into the internal politics of the country. But we also read AMREN and over time we have gained at least a working understanding of your politics. Such is the power of the internet.</p>
<p>Then you get a few other good blogs, like the one from Dr. Dan Roodt, but they are in the Afrikaans language.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found Afrikaners to be unfailingly polite, including Dan Roodt, always willing to translate Afrikaans when I&rsquo;ve requested as some of the more emotional posts on the old ZA blog  would devolve from English to Afrikaans  &mdash;  and then I am lost.</p>
<p>I miss it.  And I miss the brilliant insurgent Uhuru Guru.</p>
<p>I subscribe to Dan Roodt&rsquo;s praag, the English version.  Dan understands that to get his message out to us in the West, he must communicate in English as few of us in the US speak, write or understand Afrikaans.</p>
<p>I also read this site:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/245tchc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/245tchc</a></p>
<p>And this one, especially (not for the squeamish, but everyone White needs to see the photos of black brutality against Whites):  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2cl2mbe" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2cl2mbe</a></p>
<p>Few of us still know of your plight in SA as our media in the US refuse to print information about vile black-on-White assaults, rapes and murders.</p>
<p>Yes, the Power of the Internet.</p>
<p>Long May it Live in Freedom.</p>

<p>Our so-caled &#8220;news&#8221; media  [cough, cough!] don&rsquo;t even print racial horror stories from Tennessee   &mdash;   nor  even from the next state or city, as those are considered to be &#8220;out of town&#8221; news, and thus presumably of no interest to anybody else.  Not the kind of news we need to know! (Unless it&rsquo;s white-on-black, in which case it&rsquo;s disseminated nation-wide as the latest scandal that shames us and reflects on our national guilt.)</p>
<p>So how would we get any news at all from SA, from the same biased media, other than occasional feel-good stories about how all the races are lovey dovey in the new, happy, multi-racial paradise of South Africa?</p>
<p>Thank heavens for the Internet!  How long will be have it?</p>

<p>That is so.</p>

<p>LOL. Perhaps better so. When in rage we can be a bit more impolite and that would not present so a good international image! Also quite a few of us served in the old SADF (South African Defense Force) in a little known and sometimes vicious Bush War against communism in Africa many years ago and have some very unsavoury thoughts about our new government. Probably the same some of your Vietnam veterans have.</p>
<p>The scary thing is that this year there is a wave of arrests and murder against some leadership personalities out of the old (pre 1994) South Africa (google the names for more detail, Censorbugbear also does a fabulous job):</p>
<p>Eugene Terreblanche of the AWB (murdered), Clive Derby-Lewis (he nearly died from cancer and gangrene because the ANC authorities refused treatment - i.e. they wanted to murder him, but his lawyers intervened), a crack soldier and ex SADF commander Willem Ratte (32-Battalion) has been thrown into jail last week under false pretenses. Who is going to follow next? What is the general purpose behind all these recent actions?</p>
<p>This pretty much feels like the start of removing potential leaders out of the community, like in using East German tactics. It is quite unsettling - am very worried we will slide into a communist state (my parents fled from communism in Europe).</p>
<p>32-battalion: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIHtwe7cQxs" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIHtwe7cQxs</a></p>
<p><a href="/buecher/buch_ratte_engl.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nordbruch.org/buecher/buch_ratte_engl.pdf</a></p>
<p>I am mentioning these people for without international exposure they will disappear into an African jail forever - here it is not so nice like in European jails.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Our so-called &ldquo;news&rdquo; media [cough, cough!] don&rsquo;t even print racial horror stories from Tennessee  &mdash;  nor even from the next state or city, as those are considered to be &ldquo;out of town&rdquo; news, and thus presumably of no interest to anybody else. <br>
Not the kind of news we need to know!&#8221;</i> <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Or, as the famous motto of a famous paper states: [Not] all &#8220;the news that&rsquo;s fit to print.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, our intellectual betters who are wiser than we, will determine for us simple children <b>what news <i>IS</i> fit to print. </b>And what other news we ought not  to know. (It might disturb us, you see.)</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it nice that we have such kind guardians watching over us? How thoughtful of them to have our interests at heart.</p>
<p>When a gory multiple murder/torture of whites takes place somewhere, that would just give us poor children nightmares. No need for us to know terrible things like that!</p>
<p>But when a scribble of a loop (that looks something like a noose),  is found on a bathroom wall in Podunk, Indiana &hellip;  THAT is national news that needs to be disseminated to the masses everywhere. Or if a ball of cotton is found on some campus lawn, or stage hands have left the ropes hanging in what appears to be a racially suggestive way, or some kid grabs a loudspeaker and  makes a silly announcement   &mdash;    THAT is news of paramount national importance - because <i>it&rsquo;s part of our education  </i>in comprehending the pervasiveness of racism and white privilege in this evil racist country, which was until now run by whites.</p>
<p>One has to see it all in perspective!   Minor events, like white tortures and murders are (in the larger picture) just bizarre local incidents with no national relevance. But major events (like nooses and cotton) which shine light on our national problem of white hegemony, and thus which have national significance,  are worthy of national dissemination.</p>
<p>Now do you all understand, children?   Be glad that you have a concerned media which has your interests at heart and does not want to frighten you.  Now everyone go to bed and sleep tight. Don&rsquo;t worry about the Boogey Man, Big Brother is watching over you. <br>
