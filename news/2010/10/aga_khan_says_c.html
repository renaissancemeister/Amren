<h1>Aga Khan Says Canada&rsquo;s Diversity a Success Story</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Press, October 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Multiculturalism will reap economic benefits for Canada and help make it one of the world&rsquo;s most successful nations, the Aga Khan told a citizenship forum in Toronto on Friday.</p>
<p>The spiritual leader of the world&rsquo;s Shia Ismaili Muslims said stable, prosperous societies can not be achieved solely by spreading democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me warn against a naive hope that simply advancing the concept of democracy will achieve our goals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The high count of failed democracies, including some 40 per cent of the member states of the United Nations, should disabuse us of this notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the key to success is to embrace diversity, and countries that fail to do so are more likely to suffer from civil conflict and economic decline.</p>
<p>He gave the example of Nigeria, which has descended into violence as its numerous ethnic factions battle for control of the country&rsquo;s vast oil reserves.</p>
<p>He also pointed to the recent inter-ethnic violence that left thousands dead in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>Pluralism does not come naturally and must be taught, said the Aga Khan, pointing to what he called Canada&rsquo;s efforts to prevent both the assimilation and homogenization of its citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the Canadian experience suggests to me is that identity itself can be pluralistic  &mdash;  one can embrace an ethnic or religious heritage, while also sharing a sense of regional pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other countries must learn to allow religious and ethnic expression while developing institutions that give all a significant say, he said.</p>
<p>The Aga Khan said he was impressed to learn that some 44 per cent of Canadians are not descendents of the French and English colonists who founded the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am told, in fact, that a typical Canadian citizenship ceremony might now include people from two dozen different countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is an asset of enormous global value.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said there is an anti-immigrant backlash in some parts of the developed world caused by the global recession, lack of immigration planning, and transporting old conflicts to new homelands.</p>
<p>The religious leader gave the keynote address, amid tight security, to a symposium of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, which was founded by former governor general Adrienne Clarkson. &#8220;Citizens&rsquo; Week&#8221; kicks off in Canada on Monday.<br>

<p>Aside from the obvious contradiction (&#8220;identity can be pluralistic&#8221; ?), it speaks nothing of patriotism, or nationalism, or a commitment or love of the values of the adopted country.  Guess &#8216;cause the muslim immigrant doesn&rsquo;t really adopt his new country.</p>

		<p>So a foreigner and an ethnic says foreigners and ethnics are just great! Yeah right! (Sarcasm off). If diversity is so great why did he and his ilk get kicked out of Africa in the first place? And Canada was already a very successful and developed nation BEFORE it got &#8220;enriched&#8221; by diversity. A diversity the Canadian people never asked for or wanted, by the way.</p>

		<p>The Institute for Canadian Citizenship was founded by a Chinese immigrant who took the Western name &#8216;Adrienne Clarkson&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These are the migrants who want to undermine white Western identity by walking and talking like whites, and trying to redefine what is a Westerner by removing white racial heritage from the defining criteria.</p>

		<p>44% of Canadians AREN&rsquo;T descendants of colonists. What a shame. Too bad the majority of them had so little self-respect that they allowed their leaders sell out their children, extended family, friends &amp; ethnic kinsmen to total strangers via immigration. There was opposition but no real resistance. Not enough people gave a damn and many passionately supported MultiCult Ideology  </p>

<p>Aga - - you go need to preach and spread your wonderful message among your own folks, the Muslims. Do it there and let us see some results from the Muslim allowing others to live among them in peace.</p>
<p>Like Saudi for instance. Start there. From there, go to Iran, then from there to &hellip; etc.</p>
<p>After you have succeeded among your own kind, then come here and lecture to us, but not before.</p>

<p>This just stands out as a contradiction of everything we&rsquo;ve been told about pluralism. I thought pluralism was the natural state of affairs but it was nasty white racists and sick Western Civilization that made pluralism so difficult. So who is going to do the teaching anyway? I guess it will be the Aga Khan himself, afterall he doesn&rsquo;t like democracy much. George Orwell had a wonderful quote in the Animal Farm: &#8220;All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.&#8221; </p>

<p>And just what would this MUSLIM &#8220;spiritual leader&#8221; know about making a stable, prosperous society? Why doesn&rsquo;t he preach this &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; nonsense in his native country, doesn&rsquo;t he want his country to &#8220;reap the economic benefits&#8221; also? <br>
Ya know, it&rsquo;s really frightening that some people take idiots like this seriously, but it&rsquo;s terrifying that Whites will allow them into their countries to led them around by the nose. We need to expose these frauds - loudly - at every opportunity. In my opinion, this joker is no more a &#8220;spiritual leader&#8221; than my dog Charger. He&rsquo;s nothing more than a trojan horse! </p>

		<p>The irony here is that the Ismailites are about the most self-centered, indrawn and xenophobic group of people you can imagine. In large parts of North Africa and the Middle East, they fill the niche inhabited by Jews in Europe and the US, Zoroastrians in India, Indians in South Africa etc.</p>
<p>So, if I want advice on diversity, the Aga Khan is a little behind next-to-last. (Well, his father already liked to play the international playboy)</p>

<p><br>
No. There is an anti-immigrant backlash because over 90% of today&rsquo;s immigrants are nonwhites like this meddler. If immigrants to North America were still white Europeans like pre-1965, there would be no backlash against immigrants because there would be no PROBLEMS with immigrants. <br>

<p>  Why embrace what you don&rsquo;t need? Canada was a happy, successful country before it &#8220;embraced&#8221; diversity. Now it has rising levels of violence in its large cities, urban decay, threats of terrorism, overcrowding in some venues, and a growing class of welfare dependent immigrants. Mr.  Khan, diversity brought civil conflict and economic decline. </p>

		<p>He is being a bit self serving. Ismailis, Jews, Armenians, Sikhs<br>
and others are well suited to succeed in a Multi Cultural<br>

Ethnic networking, and Their History is One of being a Minority,<br>

		<p>I have always had a warm regard for Canada and (real) Canadians.  It is a beautiful country peopled by decent honorable folk. Before anyone believes the hype of this blathering presentation, it would do all (real) Canadians well to (1) consider the remarks of Chancellor Merkel on the German experience with &#8220;pluralism&#8221;, and (2) consider the absolutely NON PLURALISTIC character of the cruel cultures from which all of their new found &#8220;brethren&#8221; have emerged. There is nothing about the world of the Agha Khan that I wish to embrace.  Give me the Canada that existed when the Calgary Stampede still meant a rodeo.</p>
