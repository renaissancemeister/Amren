<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Maria Gianni is knocking on voters&rsquo; doors, she&rsquo;s not bashful about telling people she is in the country illegally. She knows it&rsquo;s a risk to advertise to strangers that she&rsquo;s here illegally  &mdash;  but one worth taking in what she sees as a crucial election.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old is one of dozens of volunteers  &mdash;  many of them illegal immigrants  &mdash;  canvassing neighborhoods in the Seattle area trying to get naturalized citizens to cast a ballot for candidates like Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who is in a neck-to-neck race with Republican Dino Rossi.</p>
<p>Pramila Jayapal, head of OneAmerica Votes, says the campaign is about empowering immigrants who may not feel like they can contribute to a campaign because they can&rsquo;t vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far the illegal immigrants going door-to-door aren&rsquo;t meeting opposition. Craig Keller, an organizer for Respect WA, a group pushing for stricter immigration law in the Washington, said he doesn&rsquo;t mind illegal immigrants volunteering for vote drives, he just wants to make sure mistakes on the voter rolls don&rsquo;t allow them to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody can go out and wave a sign, but when it comes to who&rsquo;s making the choices, there&rsquo;s no question they need to be citizens,&#8221; Keller said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this week in Nevada, a television ad urging Latinos not to vote sparked outcry from Democrats, who called it a dirty trick meant to keep Hispanics home and boost Republican candidates. Univision and Telemundo  &mdash;  the nation&rsquo;s two largest Spanish-language networks  &mdash;  canceled the ad, which the Republican group Latinos for Reform had planned to eventually run in Nevada, Florida, California, Texas and Colorado through the Nov. 2 election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, OneAmerica Votes launched one of the largest get-out-the-vote campaigns in the state on behalf of Democratic candidates. The organization is an offshoot of OneAmerica, one of the state&rsquo;s largest and the most influential immigrant-rights advocacy group.</p>
<p>Through home visits, phone banks and mailings the organization is aiming to reach about 40,000 registered voters in the Seattle area in an attempt to help Democrats gain ground in key races. Volunteers include other types of people who can&rsquo;t vote, such as legal permanent residents.</p>
<p>About 150 volunteers rolled out in nine cities across Washington this past week, knocking on 3,000 doors.</p>

		<p>First off, I don&rsquo;t think Dino Rossi can topple Peppermint Patty Murray anyway, even with a level playing field.  Washington State is just too blue.  So if all these illegal aliens want to concentrate all their efforts in a blue state, fine by me.  Stay away from the swing states.</p>
<p>Second, the same party which seems to have problems with supposed foreign contributions from the Chamber of Commerce (when they should love the CoC because they want amnesty and open borders) have no problems with canvassing from foreign individuals.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a dead-heat between Rossi &amp; Murray, last I checked most polls show one or the other with a lead that&rsquo;s less than the margin of error.  And it&rsquo;s about the most ridiculous political campaign you&rsquo;ve ever seen, all they do is argue about who&rsquo;s farthest in the pocket of Wall Street.</p>
<p>QD is likely right though,  Rossi is probably not going to make it because a Republican needs to win a large enough share of the vote to avoid the shenanigans of the King County Elections people who found ballots under desks, bottoms of drawers, all curiously marked Christine Gregoire until after a few recounts they had all they needed to declare her the winner.  And all this right after John Kerry conceded to Bush in &#8216;04 and announced he&rsquo;d be dispersing his remaining funds to &#8220;critical races&#8221; around the country.</p>
<p>Washington is a lot like Illinois, most of the state land area is populated by conservatives, problem is the 3 or 4 counties that are blue hold 3/4 of the population.  We unfortunately host one of the strongest bastions of loony-leftism in America that&rsquo;s sent a woman to the Senate for 18 years who had previously been an unemployed day-care worker.  Christine Gregoire, Patty Murray, and Maria Cantwell: the Kotex Mafia.  More like Keystone Kops.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far the illegal immigrants going door-to-door aren&rsquo;t meeting opposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t been to my house yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Craig Keller, an organizer for Respect WA, a group pushing for stricter immigration law in the Washington, said he doesn&rsquo;t mind illegal immigrants volunteering for vote drives, he just wants to make sure mistakes on the voter rolls don&rsquo;t allow them to vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Keller, you don&rsquo;t really have a leg to stand on if you don&rsquo;t have a problem with illegals involved in vote drives.  But that&rsquo;s the nature of politics here in Libtardastan.  I was flipping through the voting pamphlet the other day and was just disgusted.  Your choices boil down to what flavor of leftism you can best stomach.  There is no effective right-wing political organization here.  Just RINOs who&rsquo;s idea of &#8220;strict immigration laws&#8221; is being OK with criminal aliens participating in our politics.</p>

		<p>They had better not come to my door.  I will order them off my property and escort them if they say one word - in ANY language.</p>
<p>I have been seeing some Hispanics lately at the local stores.  The odd thing is that they are buying lots of water in bottles or carrying in plastich jugs to fill in bulk.  To me this means they are camping out somewhere.  I am guessing that they are illegals fleeing Arizona or perhaps Mexico itself.  In one case, I saw one of these campers paying with FOOD STAMPS.</p>
<p>I will be voting for Rossi.  He may be said to not have much chance, but so much dirt is coming out on Murray that a surprise might be possible.  We&rsquo;ll see&hellip; but I do think some things are beginning to fundamentally shift in Washington, at least outside Seattle.  Everyone I talk to, and I only talk to whites, are really fed-up with the situation.  Washington isn&rsquo;t a white minority state yet, but it is too liberal.  And when they are conservative, they are rather dumb about it, wanting to go back to an impossible past, cutting every tree in sight, unlimited fishing seasons, wall to wall expansion, as if that doesn&rsquo;t bring in non-whites, etc.  Still waiting to see that touted white IQ advantage kicking in&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Offer the nice illegal a glass of beer, tequila, or water. Now you&rsquo;ve got their DNA and fingerprints. Offer to make a tape in which you express sympathy and a promise to work with their immigrant righs group, and invite your &#8220;guest&#8221; to explain her awful life as an &#8220;undocumented&#8221; person. If there is someone else home, have a digital photo of you and MS. Illegal taken. Smile for the camera, Ms. Sanchez, Wang, or Francoise(hey, if you are in S. Florida those poor Haitian refugees want to stay forever too!).</p>

		<p>Whiteplight  &mdash;  What county  do you live in that you so rarely see Hispanics? Here in the southeast part of the state we have been overrun with Hispanics for years, and it&rsquo;s getting worse all the time. They used to be agricultural migrant workers  &mdash;  now they stay here year round. There is no way to tell the legals from the illegals, we&rsquo;d just like to get rid of them all.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Racist Until They Made Me is correct.  Dino Rossi was elected governor in Washington State, but after several court hearings and recounts, between which ballots were &#8220;found&#8221; in such unlikely places as warehouses, the office was successfully stolen by Gregoire.  This methodology of numerous court hearings, operatives recounting/recounting/recounting until enough extra ballots are found was so successful that the very same Seattle Democrat operatives were sent to &#8220;elect&#8221; Franken.  They were so proud of sending these people to Minnesota, they wrote about in the newspaper!</p>
<p>Between the previously described cheating, and the all mail voting which serves only to facilitate fraud, an honest election is almost impossible.</p>
