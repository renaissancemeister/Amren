<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2069304&amp;nid=383">Dutch Politician on Trial on Hate Speech Charges</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Sterling, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), October 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders appealed for freedom of expression Monday as he went on trial for alleged hate speech at a time when his popularity and influence in the Netherlands are near all-time highs.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Wilders has incited hate against Muslims, pointing to a litany of quotes and remarks he has made in recent years. In one opinion piece he wrote &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had enough of Islam in the Netherlands; let not one more Muslim immigrate,&#8221; adding &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had enough of the Quran in the Netherlands: Forbid that fascist book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilders argues he has a right to freedom of speech and that his remarks were within the bounds of the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a suspect here because I have expressed my opinion as a representative of the people,&#8221; Wilders told judges at the start of the trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If convicted he could face up to a year in jail, though a fine would be more likely. He could keep his seat in parliament regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>The trial was adjourned until Tuesday shortly after Wilders&rsquo; opening remarks, when he declined to answer any questions from the three judges, invoking his right to remain silent.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Jan Moors said Wilders is known for making bold statements but avoiding discussions, and added that &#8220;it appears you&rsquo;re doing so again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; lawyer, Bram Moszkowicz, said the remark showed Moors is biased against Wilders and moved to have him substituted. The move delayed the trial for at least a day as a separate panel considers the request.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; Freedom Party has agreed to support a new right-wing Dutch government set to take power with a tiny majority in parliament this month. The deal is not certain because several conservative lawmakers are hesitant to work with Wilders.</p>
<p>In return for Wilders&rsquo; support, his political allies have promised to turn away more asylum-seekers and cut immigration from nonwestern countries in half.</p>
<p>They also plan to force new immigrants to pay for their own mandatory citizenship classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mohamed Rabbae, chairman of the moderate National Moroccan Council, said outside the court that he hoped judges would force Wilders to issue an apology for his past remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not for getting Mr. Wilders in prison. We are for correcting him,&#8221; Rabbae said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors were initially reluctant to bring Wilders&rsquo; case to court, saying his remarks appeared directed toward Islam as an ideology rather than intended to insult Muslims as a group.</p>
<p>But they were eventually ordered to do so by a judge.</p>

<p>If he goes to jail, he will simply become a Martyr, and rightfully so. God help us if we aren&rsquo;t even allowed to speak.   <br>

		<p> It seems likely that Geert Wilders will be convicted of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; The term &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is so general that it seems to cover any comment that may offend or hurt the feelings of any recognized victim group. I predict a fine but no jail sentence for Mr. Wilders. The ruling elite will not make him  a martyr for free speech  &mdash;  they are too clever for that.  <br>

		<p><i> Prosecutors say Wilders has incited hate against Muslims</i></p>
<p>This idea that you can &#8220;incite&#8221; hate is a new one and a distortion of the original meaning of the word &#8220;incite.&#8221; According to the 1938 Funk &amp; Wagnall&rsquo;s Desk Standard Dictionary, incite meant &#8220;to impel to a particular <i>action,&#8221;</i>not an attitude. Yet the New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as merely to &#8220;encourage or stir up&#8221; with the specific example given as <i>&#8220;the offense of inciting racial hatred!&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>This redefinition of the word &#8220;incite&#8221; is just another step toward thought control and tyranny, as any frank speech can now be said to &#8220;incite&#8221; hatred. </p>
<p>Our ancestors seemed to have an intuitive understanding that &#8220;incite&#8221; is a strong word and should only be applied to actions, not to thoughts or feelings, but the idealogues and tyrants see it as another tool in their campaign of damping down free speech.</p>

<p>NO ONE is obligated to engage in &#8220;discussion&#8221;. You can make all the free speech you want and NOT be obligated to engage in &#8220;discussion&#8221;. At least in the U.S. that is. So far.</p>
<p>This so called judge is predisposed in the case against Wilders. He needs to recuse himself. Maybe that is only in the U.S. too. So far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not for getting Mr. Wilders in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilders ALREADY IS IN PRISON! FOR SOME YEARS MR. WILDERS HAS HAD TO LIVE IN A PRISON! The Dutch security forces have told hiom that is the only place they guarantee his safety in his own country!!</p>

<p>Yes, telling the truth has just got to stop.  It&rsquo;s giving this comical legal thug a headache.</p>
<p>With all the imams in the mosques in that country reportedly preaching jihad, this dork judge seems to be totally disconnected from that, because he hasn&rsquo;t brought up even one on charges, but he sees fit to criticize this man for making a simple statement of fact.</p>
<p>Something has just got to be done to get rid of these lame-brained, self appointed elitist in both Europe and the US.</p>

		<p>I doubt whether the &#8216;hate speech&rsquo; laws are actually intended to stop &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When the Left try to stop the BNP talking on TV they&rsquo;re doing it precisely because his views will come across as the opposite of hate speech, i.e. rational, reasonable and in line with what millions of voters secretly think. &#8220;Incitement to Hatred&#8221; laws should be renamed &#8220;Incitement to vote BNP&#8221; laws.</p>
<p>Think about it - if Nick Griffin really wanted to stand up on TV and demand gassing of the Jews and praise Adolf Hitler do you think they&rsquo;d stop him then? Of course not - they&rsquo;d probably force every TV station to air it 24 hours a day. Then the Left could say &#8220;SEE - we TOLD you he was a Nazi!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I also find it odd that so-called liberals can support the policing of people&rsquo;s emotions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more disgraceful is that you can still be prosecuted for hate speech even if what you&rsquo;re saying is undeniably true. This means the law now protects politically correct liars and punishes truth tellers. The huge success of political party Vlaams Blok in Belgium was quickly dealt with by the &#8216;authorities&rsquo; by banning them. Their &#8216;crime&rsquo; was to quote ethnic crime statistics that were freely available on the government&rsquo;s own website. </p>

		<p>I notice when people in Europe get in trouble for making non-PC statements, how much coverage and sympathy they get in the media depends a lot on which official victim group they criticized.  If you criticize Muslims and get taken to court or fined, you will get a lot of support from conservatives in the US.  If you criticize groups other than Muslims and get sentenced to years in jail, your case will be ignored by those same people.  </p>

		<p>Thank God the U.S. has the First Amendment, and thank God it&rsquo;s still being generally respected by most courts.  Of course, all this could change with one bad decision by the Supreme Court.  <br>
Like the American far left, Europe&rsquo;s idea of hate speech seems to be any utterance that doesn&rsquo;t mesh with their anti-white, pro-gay agendas.  No wonder a right-wing wave is sweeping over the  white Western world.</p>

<p>This is outrageous! Just wait until this uninvited minority increases in numbers, has several seats in parliament and has a BIG say in Dutch politics. Mr Wilders will not be correced, he and what remains of European civilization will be ELIMINATED.</p>

<p>Our right to free speech has been taken away courtesy of the forty years of corrupt politicians that should be on trial for treason.</p>
<p>Why will not white people rise up against their traitor political leaders and demand they represent their views, one of which is to cease all immigration and push out many that are here raping, assaulting, selling drugs and murdering.</p>
