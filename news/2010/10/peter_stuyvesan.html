<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After several months of uncertainty, officials have decided that the century-old Peter Stuyvesant statue will be returned to its original location on Bergen Avenue in front of School No. 11 in Jersey City.</p>
<p>Dozens of people proudly wearing &#8220;Bring Him Home&#8221; stickers assembled in front of the school this morning to hear the official announcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The [Jersey City] Board of Education mistakenly believed the statue belonged to the school district, said Maryann Kelleher, director of Jersey City&rsquo;s Division of Cultural Affairs. She called it an honest mistake the city was &#8220;happy to correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>City historian Bob Leach unearthed an Oct. 18, 1913 program of the official unveiling ceremony of the statue, created by famed American sculptor John Massey Rhind, which proves the statue belongs to the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city also has plans to recreate the original foundation with original inscriptions, Kelleher said.</p>
<p>The restoration and reinstallation project will cost an estimated $40,000. Stuyvesant should be back in Bergen Square by May 2011.<br>

<p>This is about Peter Stuyvesant and Jersey City  &mdash;  specifically when the city was born. Stuyvesant, governor of what would eventually become New York, was himself a political figure and now finds himself in the middle of a modern debate. Should he give way to more recent historic figures who resonate more with the present population?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, without any warning, workmen removed the bronze Stuyvesant statue from its place in front of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School (School 11), put it on the back of a truck and drove off. The stone-etched words on the statue were cut out and the afternoon was spent jackhammering the base.</p>
<p>The surprise attack took local historians and conservancy people off guard, and they spent the afternoon calling each other.</p>
<p>Unless a ransom note arrives, the consensus was that the order to remove the likeness of the great director-general of the New Netherlands colonies of the Dutch West Indies Company came from city Superintendent of Schools Charles T. Epps. Epps could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the plan is for a statue of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to replace Stuyvesant in front of School 11, according to local merchants and history buffs. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is some irony to all this.</p>
<p>In a New Jersey City University Web site, it is claimed the city has &#8220;the oldest continuous educational institution in the United States&#8221; dating back to the Dutch colony in the 1600s, when Bergen&rsquo;s school house was overseen by elders of the Dutch Reformed Church. Public education was free and funded by  &mdash;  yup, property taxes. You would think the Board of Education would be glad to have Peter&rsquo;s statue in place.<br>

		<p>Fascist and communist regimes, absolute dictators and despotic kings, as well as religious movements like Christianity and Islam, all have practiced the elimination of historical marks and reminders of previous rulers, national and regional &#8220;heros.&#8221;  That liberals constantly seek to rename, replace, and remove reminders of our history and past historical figures, regardless of how regional they might be, shows the tendancy toward despotic rule and political ambition.</p>

		<p>&#8220;School wanted 100-year-old statue replaced with one of Martin Luther King.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did that a couple of years ago, but I don&rsquo;t remember the school.</p>
<p>Apparently somebody took serious offence to it, because they woke up a day or two later to find that somebody had put a banana in his hand. <br>

		<p>But what&rsquo;s to become of the proposed statue of Afro-America&rsquo;s sainted MLK?  Is he expected to have to share the stage with some irrelevant old, dead white guy?  Or has the school board decided it has more important expenditures to consider: like maybe paying the city back the $40,000 cost for having damaged city property restored?      </p>

<p>Uh, isn&rsquo;t that the whole point of statues and other historical monuments&hellip;to force people to remember the important historical events that they might otherwise forget?</p>
<p>The modern world has truly gone insane.</p>
<p><i> Supposedly, the plan is for a statue of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to replace Stuyvesant in front of School 11</i></p>
<p>Ah, so we have the real reason behind the whole plot &hellip; to replace an important white guy with an unimportant black one. So what else is new?</p>

<p>So you think that this is an egregious act of &#8220;cultural vandalism&#8221;, perhaps on the order of knocking down a Confederate Soldier Memorial in front of a Southern courthouse??</p>
<p>Allow me to expound on a contemporary scenario of &#8220;cultural vandalism&#8221; that has occurred in the small podunk Southern city of Burlington, NC.</p>
<p>The main Burlington City Park is the site of one of about eight fully restored and functioning Dentzel Carousels in North America and has been desecrated by the close proximity placement of a water fountain &#8220;donated&#8221; by Burlington&rsquo;s (unchosen by any mechanism that vaguely resembles an at large plebiscite) sister city of Soledad de Gracianao Sanchez.</p>

		<p>I think it is only natural for the citizens of Jersey City to prefer a statue of a man who espoused values similar to their own. A statue of a womanizing socialist doper who was instrumental in undermining the lifestyle of the historical majority of America is very likely a good fit for the present citizens of that once great city.</p>

		<p>Just what the world needs - another statue of the plagiarizing, whoremongering black &#8220;hero&#8221; MLK.</p>
<p>A far more legitimate and courageous black hero was Jackie Robinson and his white sponsor, Branch Rickie.  And frankly, I suspect that Robinson was King&rsquo;s intellectual superior in the bargain.</p>

		<p>How dare they disrespectfully tear down both an example of Western art and a historical landmark! Do they value anything prior to MLK?</p>
<p>Though the most intellectual of humans will see all history as their own, most of us, will not. I&rsquo;ve been told by African Americans they have no connection to Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, or even George Washington. They see that as our history, and rightfully so. So why do people believe that non-whites are interested (generally) in the preservation of our architecture, art, and monuments? <br>
Look at classical orchestras, how many non-whites (excluding Asians) do you see? How many non-whites study classical art, architecture, and music? How many non-whites do you see on historic preservation committees? How many non-whites are Norse or Hellenic pagans? They do not feel connected, and thus they see as much value in our culture and history as we do in some non-western nation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p><br>
In my own city, we have a road that is over 200 years old and retains its original name, but if the African American community has its way, it will be renamed MLK road. Everything is changed to MLK, everything. Historic roads, schools, neighborhoods, etc are changed to MLK, which is also usually a sign that the community has fallen into decay. <br>

Reviewing the online records on the removal and restoration of the Peter Stuyvesant statue could be a case study in preserving our monuments.  The statue to a founder of European Civilization in North America was removed to sit on the back of a truck in a commercial lot, and those who did it were surprised that there was criticism of the removal.  Objections were treated as an attack on Martin Luther King.  Defenders of Western history did not give up.  There were letters to the editor of the <i>Jersey Journal</i>, the very liberal newspaper in Jersey City, NJ.  As one writer <a><br>
described the situation:</a><br>
<blockquote><br>
The statue reminded generations of Jersey City&rsquo;s citizens, many of whom might otherwise not have noticed, that our city, under Dutch auspices, was the place where the first church, school and court were erected in New Jersey. Jersey City began in that 800-square-foot square, surrounded by a wooden palisade to protect the settlers, and the outlines of that village are still visible today in the building lines along Academy Street.<br>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The letters were posted on line, which <a><br>
 evoked many more comments on-line</a>.</p>
<p><br>
People also complained to elected officials.  Eventually the vandals became defensive.  An alternative site was offered, because apparently the statue of Peter Stuyvesant and the statue of MLK shouldn&rsquo;t be in the same place; after all, there was slavery in existence in the 1600s. A leader of a local historical association <a> wrote an impressive op-ed piece </a> which began </p>
<blockquote>
The recent thought to find a &#8220;better&#8221; place for the historic statue of Peter Stuyvesant in Jersey City may have been well-intentioned   &mdash;   but was misguided. The statue was cast 100 years ago to stand at Bergen Square precisely because Bergen Square was the literal center (in New England, it would have been called the &#8220;Common&#8221;) of the first permanent European settlement in New Jersey.
<p>
In 1660, the Village of Bergen was created around the Square as part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Stuyvesant, director general of the colony, had personally approved the location and layout of the village. The first government, court and school in our state were all organized around Bergen Square.
<p>
Within a few years, the post route connecting Boston to Philadelphia crossed Bergen Square over what is today Academy Street and Bergen Avenue, and in the build-up to the American Revolution Paul Revere and other couriers passed through the Square along this route. With the statue now gone, there is almost nothing to let passersby in Bergen Square know of this history.&rdquo;
</p></p></blockquote>
<p>No one seems to know who gave the order to remove the statue.  <a>Dr.&#8221;&gt;http://www.jcboe.org/administration/superintendent&rsquo;s-message.aspx&rdquo;&gt;Dr.</a> Charles T. Epps, Jr., superintendent of the Jersey City Schools probably gave the final approval.  Dr. Epps continues at his $268,000 salary leading the usual failed city school system, with the usual demographics, with the usual learning outcomes and drop-out rates.</p>
<p>We are at the point of pleading for equal rights, the right to save our heritage in a system where our history isn&rsquo;t taught in schools.  This battle is fought monument by monument.  This wasn&rsquo;t a victory.  The Stuyvesant statue is back but the real damage in being done inside the high school.</p>

Pleading indeed.  Yes, as I recall there was a similar case in San Jose, CA just a few years ago (regarding Capt. Thomas Fallon who first raised the American flag over San Jose). And there was also the statue of Queen  Catherine of Braganza (for whom &#8220;Queens county&#8221; is named) which was to be erected in New York City.<br>
