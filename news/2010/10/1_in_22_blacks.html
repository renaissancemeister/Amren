<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Health officials estimate that 1 in 22 black Americans will be diagnosed with the AIDS virus in their lifetime  &mdash;  more than twice the risk for Hispanics and eight times that of whites.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the numbers Thursday. The report says the lifetime risk is 1 in 52 for Hispanics, and 1 in 170 for whites.</p>
<p>Asian-Americans had the lowest lifetime risk, at about 1 in 222.</p>

		<p>That number is EXTREMELY low balled.  Consider this&hellip;.AIDS is epidemic in the prison system, due to near universal gay sexual behavior and rape among blacks (plus needle drug use).  The incarceration rate is extremely high.  Nearly half of all black males are arrested for a serious felony over their lifetimes&hellip;..with an extremely high liklihood of exposure to AIDS.</p>
<p>Add in to this the fact that many gays are purposefully seeking infection (most new AIDS cases have been such purposeful infections) and, although nobody knows for sure, the number is far higher than 1 in 22.<br>

<p>Uh I think it is called &#8220;Bug chasing&#8221; it is a real thing, amongst the gays nowdays. My best guess is gays are so promiscuous that sex for them eventually loses all thrill requiring deeper and deeper levels of perversion.</p>
<p>Half the thrill of heterosexual sex is trying to get the girl. Gay guys don&rsquo;t exactly play hard get. </p>
<p>As everyone else says, black guys just bang everything that moves. Man, woman, child, senior citizen etc. through begging, rape, or otherwise. It isn&rsquo;t gay in the normal sense, it is more akin to a dog mounting your leg.<br>

		<p>I like the way they can predict infection rates into the future based on race. So they are expecting different behaviors depending on race.</p>

		<p>There are some young gays who purposefully try to get infected.  They&rsquo;re called &#8220;bug chasers.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure there are many complicated psychological reasons why they do this, and I&rsquo;m sure the reasons would depress me.</p>
<p>Back to African-Americans, now.</p>
<p>When HIV was first discovered in the gay community, about 30 years ago, it was clearly stated that it was transmitted due to two things, mainly:   sex and sharing of needles.</p>
<p>In fighting the scourge, the gay community ONLY preached against mindless promiscuity   &mdash;   and eventually, the rate of HIV among gay males went down.</p>
<p>For some years now, the greatest group at risk have been African-Americans.</p>
<p>So, what do I read in the mainstream media as to why this should be?</p>
<p>The same old list of nonsense:  It&rsquo;s due to poverty, racism, lack of access to health care, lack of access to education, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Everything BUT their own mindless behavior!</p>
<p>(And, of course, there are also the Rev. Wrights who say evil white people purposely introduced HIV into the black community.  How white people got black people to engage in mindless promiscuity, the good reverend isn&rsquo;t clear on.)</p>
<p>Anyway   &mdash;   since the high rate of HIV in the black community is due to, and only due to, the mindless sexual promiscuity in the black community, and since the problem isn&rsquo;t being dealt with in those terms, it will only get worse.</p>
<p>And ask me if I care!  (Except that it&rsquo;s such a drain on our health care system, no, I don&rsquo;t really care.)</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The major reason for the lower projection is good news: global fertility rates have declined more rapidly than expected, as health care, including reproductive health, has improved faster than anticipated, and men and women have chosen to have smaller families*.  About one-third of the reduction in long-range population projections, however, is due to increasing mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Indian subcontinent. The most important factor is HIV/AIDS, which is spreading much faster than previously anticipated. </p>
<p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic is having a devastating effect on Africa. Estimates released in 1998 by UNAIDS and the World Health Organization indicate that global HIV infections increased 10 per cent in 1998 to 33.4 million people worldwide. In 1999 alone, an estimated 5.8 million people contracted the virus that causes AIDS. Fig. 8  shows the likely impact of AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa, comparing population projections with and without AIDS in the 29 most-affected countries, 1980-2050. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4yxue</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The report also indicates that a number of African countries will experience levels of mortality during this decade that will lower the average life expectancy at birth to around 30 years by 2010, a level not seen since the beginning of the 20th century. Much of this decline in life expectancy is likely to result from AIDS mortality. </p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>There were an estimated 12,045 deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2006, and age-adjusted death rates from the disease declined 4.8% from 2005.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/6yubok</p>
<p>As there have been marked decreases in both HIV precursors and fullblown AIDS outbreaks since 2005, I think they are playing the sympathy card on the latest in a long line of &#8216;afflictions&rsquo; that whites have supposedly used to destroy blacks in America, going back to syphilis and running through crack cocaine.</p>
<p>Mo&rsquo; Money, Mo&rsquo; Money, Mo&rsquo; Genital Washing Money.</p>
<p>If there are shifts, demographically, it will be blacks doing -anything- to breed into white or hispanic communities as their men are locked up for life and social welfare fails, utterly to sustain a dependent based existence.</p>
<p>Add to this a likely &#8216;flash mob&rsquo; pack adolescent effect in Africa as the wisdom base of whole nations essentially are obliterated and you have a _Lord Of The Flies_ conditioned global black populace where life will get very bad indeed, for some people, in some places, around them.</p>
<p>None of which will have a thing to do with white/asian controlled resource monopolies like timeber, oil, coffee or diamonds/gold/titanium.  Or wealthy, upper class, gated communities, here in the States.</p>
<p>India will also be hard hit in the rural villages, especially in their &#8216;dormitory&rsquo; vision of group access to children (which could make Thai sex industry look like something by Walt Disney).</p>
<p></p>
<p>KPl.</p>
<p><br>
*Actually what is causing the smaller families is the &#8216;rescheduling&rsquo; of IMF/World Bank and now WTO debts such as those which piled up in Indonesia where Suharto essentially embezzzeled 1/3 of 30 billion dollars in loans to build and buy off a nepotistic Indonesian Elite.</p>
<p>When those loans came due and nobody could account for the missing money, rather than wave the debt as &#8216;undelivered&rsquo; to the Indonesian people, a WTO committee went in and punished JQ Public by cutting all Federal Subsidies for healthcare, education and even fresh water.</p>
<p>This, in combination with a deliberate devaluation (the 90s collapse was another induced fraud) of the IDR/Rupiah from around 2,500:1 to 10,000:1 equivalency to the USD essentially means that Western Multicorps like GAP, Nike and Ol&rsquo; Navy now OWN the Indonesian people with 16-24hr workshifts mandated, nobody really has the energy to breed on a 1 dollar a day salary.</p>
<p>That this is a world wide event is highlighted in a Youtube video &#8216;New World Rulers&rsquo;-</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2ah84yv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2ah84yv</a></p>
<p>Wherein an IMF toady basically states: &#8220;Yes it&rsquo;s (the corrupt hijacking of funds to which populations are held hostage) is true and yes we should forgive the debt because it was up to the West to ensure it&rsquo;s &#8216;delivery&rsquo; to the people it was allocated to on a fiduciary basis.  But that if we did, the IMF would be bankrupt by the end of the week because the U.S. funded Cold War Containment with these kinds of loans -everywhere-.</p>
<p>Point Blank: I worry more about what happens when distributionism style capitalism fails than I do about disease perse`.  It will be the collapse of a U.S. run &#8216;capitalist&rsquo; social order that ultimately causes all manner of diseases to explode in lethality and spread, globally, if not contained to the poor nations.</p>
<p>I only hope we are able to stand up a replacement, robotic, economy has we pull back our burnt fingers.</p>

<p>This is an open secret among the gay subculture.  The keywords for this behavior are &#8220;bug chasers&#8221; and &#8220;gift givers&#8221;.  Googling these terms will dredge up all sorts of unpleasant information about AIDS.  Although I can no longer find the source that documented most (ie over half) of new AIDS infections as a result of intentional infection (and it&rsquo;s not as if the CDC has permission to track such things), every account marks this behavior as widespread&hellip;.lowball estimates are about 1/4 of new AIDS cases being intentional.</p>
<p>These people are holding AIDS parties all over the place, seeking intentional infection&hellip;.for various reasons that range from the psychotic (ie erotic satisfaction) to the utilitarian (to get a welfare check).</p>
<p>Your attempt to imply that gays are (in your experience) normal people flies in the face of common sense, public observation and, quite frankly, the experience of almost everyone.  Personally, I have never met a gay person who wasn&rsquo;t morbidly depraved, had a sinister agenda, and engaged in many obnoxious, illegal and victim oriented behaviors.  Screwed up doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe what the vast majority of gays are like.</p>
<p>I am tempted to say there are no exceptions (I&rsquo;ve never met one) but anything is possible.  But whether or not there is the rare exception is not the point.  The overwhelming majority of gays are just something not to be allowed in a normal person&rsquo;s sphere of influence.  Allowing it has consequences.  A quick google of any of the &#8220;gay pride&#8221; events in california will QUICKLY demonstrate what I am talking about.  Last year, they had very young children lead around on leashes while groups of men engaged in sex acts out in the open, in front of them.  There were cops everywhere and did nothing (although I am sure that they would be pretty quick to intervene if someone like me acted to protect those children).</p>
<p>That is what your tolerance and blindness leads to.  You quickly jump in to defend the very worst in human behavior.  And the reason you do it is politically correct brainwashing.</p>

		<p>It does not surprise me that black people have the AIDS/HIV because of their careless promiscuity. As for homosexuals, I consider the virus among them to be nature&rsquo;s way of saying, &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;Don&rsquo;t&#8221;. This reminds of this gay drug addict who lived in my neigborhood. He was HIV positive and would start up trouble because he knew they would not punch him in fear of contracting the virus. One day the people he was staying with tried to run him off with bats and two-by-fours and he tried to run up into my front door screaming, &#8220;They are trying to kill me! Help me!.&#8221; I immediatly slammed the door shut in his face and he went back down the stairs. Later the police arrested him and I remember they were wearing blue gloves and really did not want to touch the guy and I believe they may have made him cuff himself with several officers forming a peramiter around him. </p>
<p>This guy gave me the creeps, not so much because of what he is and his infection, buthis appearance. He literally looked like a walking skeleton or something out of a zombie movie. He had sores all over his mouth and his voice was deep and raspy. I would walk an extra ten miles to avoid walking close to this guy. </p>
<p>What alarms me is not so much the fact that the numbers are growing, but the fact that so many people want to spread the disease. I guess people feel as though if they are going to die then they should take as many people with themas they can get by with doing. In the early twentieth century, the government was going to forcibly quarantine TB patients to avoid further outbreaks. Should we do this to AIDS/HIV patients? I say yes because they have no right to spread it amongst other people, either willingly or unwillingly. </p>

A few gay people do this, just like some heterosexuals who have intercourse in public (for the thrill), but in general, I don&rsquo;t know a single gay man who would even think of such a thing. It is suicide. <br>
In addition, you don&rsquo;t have to play hard if you want an easy guy, but if you want a functioning relationship you have to play hard.  See this is why I hate shows like Will and Grace, Glee, etc because they portray homosexuals as effeminate whores. <br>
&ldquo;As everyone else says, black guys just bang everything that moves. Man, woman, child, senior citizen etc. through begging, rape, or otherwise. It isn&rsquo;t gay in the normal sense, it is more akin to a dog mounting your leg.&rdquo;<br>
Same reason blacks in Africa have such a high level of AIDS. Their sexual drive is higher than that of Caucasians or East Asians. <br>

		<p>Well, maybe I&rsquo;ve been very sheltered, but I&rsquo;ve never seen this &#8220;big chaser&#8221; phenomenon.  I personally think it is more urban legend than anything else, but the haters love to cite alleged activities such as this one to perpetuate yet more stereotypes.  To be sure, I do feel that stereotypes exist for a reason, I see all the gay stereotypes in many, but not all, gay people I&rsquo;ve known.  I&rsquo;ve also seen a lot of commonly gay stereotypes in straight people too! But this bug chaser stuff seems a bit far-fetched to me, and I don&rsquo;t see how it is relevant to the news item at hand.</p>
<p>People, we are all here because we care about our fellow Europeans and European-Americans.  PLEASE don&rsquo;t try to fracture our solidarity with hate speech about gay people.  There are more of us out there who support the European/European-American cause than you may realize.  Please don&rsquo;t try to alienate us.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an urban myth.</p>
<p>I doubt it&rsquo;s wide spread but it&rsquo;s real. It seems some gay men are simply sick and tired of being uptight with personal sexual restrictions that there are now individuals who seek to get infected just so they can &#8216;get it over with&rsquo; per say and then just have all the unprotected sex they want.</p>

		<p>Gay Conservative:  I am happy that you support Euro American White causes.  Do you also support gay marriage?  If so, then you are not a Conservative.  Are you a &#8220;log cabin republican&#8221;?  Which is to say, a fifth column totally concerned with the gay agenda (totally normalizing the abnormal) more  than about any conservative plank in the Republican party (those few conservative planks the RINO&rsquo;s haven&rsquo;t disowned).  Do you hold in contempt Christians as so many of the gay community do, since Christians believe in biblical admonitions and biblical marriage as sacred?  Frankly, when gays were merely asking to live their lives and not be physically assaulted, we all agreed.<br>
But that wasn&rsquo;t enough for the gay community.  NOW they are demanding marriage, cross dressing in the workplace, man on boy &#8220;love&#8221; rights, attacking and intimidating Christians in the most vile ways, attempting to pass all sorts of legislation making ANY criticism or view contrary to homosexuality a crime, etc etc etc.  Excuse us for objecting to the gay agenda and believing the worst of the gay community.   AIDS began with gay behavior.  And since gays are often into drug use, it also became spread by needle use.  Since gays are often on the &#8220;down low&#8221; with their wives, they infected their wives and girlfriends who then passed it on to others which is how it spread to the general population.  Put shortly, if you truly support White morality, White culture, White rights, White family values, the sustaining of White majority in America through procreation - you cannot be gay.<br>
There are no &#8220;gay&#8221; conservatives nor &#8220;black&#8221; conservatives.  Your entire world view is driven, like the blacks, by what you are.  That&rsquo;s clear by your adding Gay to Conservative in your sign-on.  Trying to have it both ways.  </p>

<p>BTW, it is a known fact that BLACKS are much more promiscuous than any other race. Look at all the rapes they commit just to name one crime they commit in large numbers compared to their demographic. And yes, gays are much more promiscuous than straights are. No, it is not only a stereotype, it is FACT! As for the myth of conditioning ourselves to think this way, as you claim, is another tall tale you are perpetrating.</p>
<p> Most of us have eyes to see and we read studies and facts based on the homosexual behavior. Have you ever read any article by the DOCTORS who have treated these &#8220;gays&#8221;? Maybe you should. Many of us know homosexuals and many have family memebers who are &#8220;gay&#8221;. So don&rsquo;t tell us we are only stereotyping! </p>
<p> Call us &#8220;haters&#8221; etc. just like YOU have been conditioned to do, doesn&rsquo;t make us haters in the least. Seems to me that it is the homosexual community that hate the heterosexuals to such an extent that they are shoving their lifestyle on the rest of us. In the movies, on TV, in our schools, promoting the lifestyle to our young kids (which I will never forgive nor forget) and the list goes on and on. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m gay and I have to admit that before reading the above comments about this article I had never heard of &#8220;bug chasers.&#8221; I&rsquo;ve visit many gay orienatated dating sites and singles bars and never have I encountered someone with a desire to &#8216;bug chase&rsquo; or whatever. The last thing I want is to contract HIV and I think the large majority of gay whites feel the same way. However, I think aj&rsquo;s comment that &#8216;Half the thrill of heterosexual sex is trying to get the girl. Gay guys don&rsquo;t exactly play hard get&rsquo; pretty much sums up why gay men are more permiscious and thus more likely to get STDs than straight guys. I guess women have tend to have a &#8216;civilizing&rsquo; effect on the veracious sexual appatite of (many) hetero males. Also gay men don&rsquo;t fear preganacy like heterosuals and therefore have one less incentive to wear a condom. (that&rsquo;s why a male birth-control pill is a bad idea, bit I digress.) And I do consider myself a conservative. I don&rsquo;t think its immpossible to be one if your a homosexual. I like any real conservative supports an end to any and all forms of affirmative action, an immigration moratorium and a removal of all incentives that facilitate and encourage illegal immigration. I don&rsquo;t want to live in a third-world dystopia any more than the average straight white person. </p>

<p>There are a number of Black men who are gay professionals. MSNBC, Fox News, The New York Times and even Oprah Winfrey have done shows about this. Some are on the down low, others are open like the above poster who did in fact, post a comment on another post recently. I saw it. <br>

<p>Do you not beleive that there are Black gay men? Are you serious?  You should know better. I do believe the above poster&rsquo;s story. </p>
<p>I remember the Bob Allen situtation in Florida a few years ago. I remember someone posting a link from the smoking gun website of a story about a White businessman (married  by the way) who had sex with a similarly educated Black male and was blackmailed by the man for money.</p>
<p>Former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevy in his book &#8220;The Confession&#8221; talks about how he would attempt to hook up with  professional Black and Hispanic men when he was out of town for extra sexual satisfaction. He also felt that his double life would be less likely to be exposed. Obviously he had sex with a number of White men behind the Washington monument, on the New Jersey turnpike etc&hellip; </p>
<p>More recently there was a very influential White male former literary agent who gave several interviews earlier this year to the New York Times, Salon, Slate, The National Review and other publications about his sexual encounters with a number of professional Black, Asian and Hispanic men. He eventually became so addicted to hard partying and cocaine that his lost his career and he is attempting to make a comeback. It is common knowledge that a number of gay men have sex across racial lines.</p>
<p>I live in Dallas and I drive by a certain park on my way to work each morning and I see White and Black men trying to get with one another all the time.</p>
<p>It does happen.</p>

		<p>I think one of the things that aggravates me the most about this looney world of ours is the way people think that if they believe something to be true   &mdash;   if they SAY it&rsquo;s true   &mdash;   then it IS true!</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like this website so much is because most of us here can fearlessly say what&rsquo;s REALLY true, even though so many people may not like it.</p>
<p>What was said above there   &mdash;   that black men or gay men are no more promiscous than any other type of man (white, yellow, straight)   &mdash;   is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t decide these things by anecdotes, by merely saying, &#8220;Well, I know a black man, and he isn&rsquo;t promiscuous.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have to go by the general trend   &mdash;   by the statistics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt   &mdash;   NONE   &mdash;   that black men and gay men are, on average, incredibly, mindlessly promiscuous.</p>
<p>Why else was the rate of HIV transmission highest among those groups?  Just a coincidence?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget about that man who was recently in the news for fathering 23 children with 14 women.  Did it shock anyone to find out he was black?</p>
<p>Which brings up at least one good thing about homosexual sex:  It might spread disease, but at least it won&rsquo;t result in more babies that have to be supported by the government.</p>

		<p>Interesting comments on &#8220;bug chasers&#8221;. I had never heard of that before either though after thinking about it, it isn&rsquo;t all that surprising. Sounds like lots of issues are at play, guilt, death wishes, possibly admiring the &#8220;real players&#8221; that have gotten the virus. For young gay men it would be a constant overshadowing thought and some apparently decide to embrace it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Gay Conservative: I am happy that you support Euro American White causes. Do you also support gay marriage? If so, then you are not a Conservative. Are you a &ldquo;log cabin republican&rdquo;? Which is to say, a fifth column totally concerned with the gay agenda (totally normalizing the abnormal) more than about any conservative plank in the Republican party (those few conservative planks the RINO&rsquo;s haven&rsquo;t disowned). Do you hold in contempt Christians as so many of the gay community do, since Christians believe in biblical admonitions and biblical marriage as sacred? Frankly, when gays were merely asking to live their lives and not be physically assaulted, we all agreed.<br>
But that wasn&rsquo;t enough for the gay community. NOW they are demanding marriage, cross dressing in the workplace, man on boy &ldquo;love&rdquo; rights, attacking and intimidating Christians in the most vile ways, attempting to pass all sorts of legislation making ANY criticism or view contrary to homosexuality a crime, etc etc etc. Excuse us for objecting to the gay agenda and believing the worst of the gay community. AIDS began with gay behavior. And since gays are often into drug use, it also became spread by needle use. Since gays are often on the &ldquo;down low&rdquo; with their wives, they infected their wives and girlfriends who then passed it on to others which is how it spread to the general population. Put shortly, if you truly support White morality, White culture, White rights, White family values, the sustaining of White majority in America through procreation - you cannot be gay.<br>
There are no &ldquo;gay&rdquo; conservatives nor &ldquo;black&rdquo; conservatives. Your entire world view is driven, like the blacks, by what you are. That&rsquo;s clear by your adding Gay to Conservative in your sign-on. Trying to have it both ways. &ldquo;<br>
Though a great deal of bigotry and ignorance in this nation is fabricated, this truly is not. Yes, there are some gay men that are whores and yes there are some gay men that hate Christians, but what you say here is for most conservative gays, lies. And yes, you can be conservative and gay because there is more to being conservative than being Christian or Heterosexual. I hate gay pride parades just as much as you do, and I cannot stand cross-dressing. I believe in the importance of white preservation, our wonderful civilization, and need for tradition. Does that make me a liberal? I am gay, yet I have no evil agenda. What I want is what any other racially aware white man wants; peace, safety, and a future for his people. <br>
Though many things about flamboyant gays are abnormal, the homosexuality itself is not (you are confusing unlikely and wrong). I find it disgusting that one Euro-American would inflict such insult upon a fellow Euro-American based on their sexuality. <br>
The only reason a conservative gay (of WASP background) would have any issue with the church is if they directly attack or support hostility towards homosexuals. If peaceful, they have just as much a right as anyone else in a democratic society to voice their concerns against gay marriage, but to deny people the right to life and the right to their posterity is nothing short of evil. <br>
The white revival will not survive if it is purely based on nostalgia for a &ldquo;better time&rdquo;. If you based it on Momma and Apple pie, the movement will die and any attempt to preserve our people will be killed. We have to base it off pragmatism and inclusiveness (amongst whites) because if you narrow it down to simply heterosexual religious Christian men the movement will not survive (though we will not survive without them). Though our ancestors did many things right, there are some things they did wrong. <br>
&ldquo;&ldquo;Put shortly, if you truly support White morality, White culture, White rights, White family values, the sustaining of White majority in America through procreation - you cannot be gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where do people get the idea that homosexuals cannot reproduce? Lesbians have children all the time and gay men often adopt or use of surrogates. There is even a gay &ldquo;baby boom&rdquo; currently happening.  <br>
Besides, the more we crack, the easier we fall. I will not support the destruction of this movement based on something as little as sexuality. <br>

What paranoia. The city that is our race is being attacked in every direction, and rather than firing the cannons at the enemy, you have gone into the streets and began attacking citizens! <br>
I do not support the obnoxious gays you see on TV, the in your face attitude of many, but at the same time, I ask that such anger towards them not be inflicted upon those of us who happen to be gay but do not support the ridiculous subculture. <br>

<p>Just because heterosexual White men have a lower incidence of STD&rsquo;s (if that is in fact true), it does not mean that they are any less promiscuous. It most likely means that they are more apt to use condoms. </p>
<p>Your argument is like saying that poor and lower income tend to have more sex than upper income and rich people. This is probably not true, people probably have a similar level of sex regardless of socio economic background. But rather, the fact is that wealthier people have more resources, are often better educated and are more inclined to use birth control.</p>
