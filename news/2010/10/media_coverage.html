			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Third Position, October 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The racial element to the use of state-issued welfare debit cards  &mdash;  which have been used to withdraw millions at casinos, holiday resorts, and even on cruise ships  &mdash;  has deliberately been hidden by the mass media in their coverage of the scandal.</p>
<p>Reports in the Los Angeles Times and other major national news outlets have all focused on the shocking news that more than $69 million meant to help the needy pay their rent and clothe their children was accessed in 49 other states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam between January 2007 and May 2010.</p>
<p>More than $11 million was spent or withdrawn in Las Vegas, with $1 million of that at shops and casino hotels on or within a block or two of the famous strip. The data shows that $8,968 was accessed at the Tropicana and $7,995 at the Venetian and its Grand Canal Shoppes.</p>
<p>Incredibly, some $16,010 was withdrawn from ATMs on 14 cruise ships sailing from locations such as Long Beach, Rio de Janeiro, and Beijing. Other out-of-state transactions include more than $1.5 million spent or withdrawn in Florida and $387,908 accessed in Hawaii.</p>
<p>None of the reports dared address the obvious: that the welfare bill has spun out of control due to the massive increase in immigration levels.</p>
<p>According to official figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2000, the welfare use rates for immigrants in California stands at 28 percent (just slightly below New York City at 30 percent, but above Massachusetts and Texas, both at 25 percent).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Furthermore, data from a Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) report issued in 2008 revealed that 25 percent of Los Angeles County&rsquo;s welfare and food stamp benefits goes directly to the children of illegal aliens, at a cost of $36 million a month, at a projected annual cost of $432 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total cost for illegal immigrants to County taxpayers far exceeds $1 billion a year  &mdash;  not including the millions of dollars for education,&#8221; the DPSS report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With $220 million for public safety, $400 million for healthcare, and $432 million in welfare allocations, illegal immigration continues to have a devastating impact on Los Angeles County taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figures make it clear that welfare dependency amongst nonwhites in California (legal and illegal immigrants included) is three times higher than amongst whites.</p>
<p>The media is doing a great disservice to the voting public by ignoring the obvious racial and immigration implications of the latest welfare benefits fraud scandal, and should not be surprised when thinking members of the public reach to alternative news sources such as the Internet.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it costs to educate the millions of children of illegals, but I would guess that education costs run at least $150,000/student over the entire K-12 period (13 yrs) (remember that education costs include everything from pay for administrators, secretaries, coaches, janitors, nurses, librarians, cafeteria staff, bus drivers, and school psychologists,  field trips, swimming pools, athletic fields and gymnasiums, sports equipment, books &amp; supplies, free lunches, buildings, maintainance &amp; construction, buses, heating and cooling, water, sewage, electricity, and natural gas, and for some schools, police and metal detectors.  </p>
<p>Multiply $150,000 by 5 million children of illegal aliens, and now you know why your taxes are so high and why California is bankrupt.</p>

		<p>Yes, working White and Asian people pay a very high price to support the children of Mexico.  But, we are proud to do it!  True, we must have fewer children, because we cannot afford to have more, and because both parents must work, and yes our children go without.  However, at least we know that Mexican parents can have large families and that their children will have the best education our money can buy.  </p>
<p>Stop being racist!  Support higher taxes so that we the people of Mexico can have a better life. </p>

		<p>I always wondered how so many black women where I live drive expensive luxury cars.   Housing allowance, food allowance, children&rsquo;s welfare money make luxury items and expensive vacations easy.  How can anyone say that blacks are not getting reparations?</p>

		<p>If the States won&rsquo;t do the obvious and turn of the flow of cash from tap, it&rsquo;s time Americans turned off the flow from the meter.</p>
<p>Has anyone stopped to consider what would happen if we just said: &#8220;See&rsquo;ya!&#8221; ????</p>
<p>California would revert to Mexico.  Whoopy.  As a function of warm water access to the Pacific, we would still have Seattle and for that matter Canada and perhaps, with a little more provision of sea lane controls, Alaska.</p>
<p>Alternately, commercial goods can go through the Panama Canal to reach the East Coast.</p>
<p>I know we are bleeding out terribly supporting a Hispanic Wonderland but what I am curious about now is how much we would LOSE if we did indeed Secede, if not from the Union then certainly from any socialist state there of.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s coming down to that point: How much can we afford to lose, now, to cut our levels of future indemnity?</p>
<p>Is there a website out there which has had the balls to say: &#8220;Okay, let&rsquo;s do it!&#8221; and tear down the United States on a profit or downsizing writeoff basis?  I would like to see it.</p>

		<p>We, the public need to vote in people like Jim Russell, authored The Western Contribution to World History, who are not afraid to speak the truth about racial genetic differences in educational achievement, work ethics, etc.  The future generation will have a lot of  work to do with the uncontrollable breeding of people who should not be breeding and to get Western Civilization back to white majority.  Perhaps, economic competition from China will speed that along.  China in the coming years will take place itself in a leadership position.  </p>
<p>This country need to throw off the yoke of oppression and brainwashing from the media and the courts.  It is because of this that this country is in a decline.  The media wants people like Rangel, Waters, Obama, Pelsoi, Boxer, Feinstein, etc., etc. to be in power.   </p>

		<p>I read that the stimulus bill increased welfare spending to around 787 billion over the next 10 years.  I can think of some simple common sense cost cutting measures that would prevent fraud, reduce the welfare budget and give people an incentive to find a job.  They should stop allowing people to draw cash on these cards period and only allow them to make authorized purchases with them.  Authorized purchases meaning necessities like food, toiletries, medicine or things like birth control.  Cigarettes?  Declined.  Liquor?  Declined. Big hoop earrings?  Declined.  They could reduce the food stamp budget by forcing people to buy generic brands, prohibit buying junk food, sodas and luxury items like filet mignon, lobster and shrimp.  </p>

		<p>Welfare doesn&rsquo;t go &#8220;directly&#8221;to the children of illegals. The parent(s) receives it on behalf of the children, who are too young to transact anything on their own. It is a family subsidy in addition to all the cash income coming in from various sources. The illegals are quite bold and open in applying for welfare and have no fear of being deported. Most drive up to the welfare office in nice vans and SUV&rsquo;s; just hang around outside any such office and watch them drive up. The vehicles are better than those of the employees. Judging from this story there there must be plenty of racketeering schemes involving these ATM style welfare cards.</p>

<p>Indeed.  I have long ended all newspaper subscriptions and never watch the TV news.  Newspaper publishers think that the problem is that the internet is free, and are desperate to figure out how to monetize it.  Actually, their problem is that they have been hiding the truth for so long they don&rsquo;t even know what the truth is anymore, so those of us who want the truth go to the  few corners of the internet where it can be found.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a woman living in california and housing costs are sooo high because of the million on section 8 housing that I never was able to even consider children. But I am proud that my taxes support mexican and black children - they are our future. I think a black and brown california majority population will lead the way and show us how wonderful our great future as a non white nation will be. Every day I see white girls who just cant wait to date and have children with our wonderful black neighbors. White women no longer chose intelligent hard working white males for mates, they prefer low class men white or any race because they know the government provides for everything. This wonderful change makes it possible for women to shun our hard working men so they can just work all day and be very productive. California only needed a 42 billion dollar bailout from the &#8220;stimulus&#8221; to catch up and be only 20 billion in debt this year. If every year the rest of the states give california 100 billion dollars there will not be these gaps in funding. We must do this soon.</p>

		<p>Money disbursed to social welfare recipients doesn&rsquo;t remain in their hands very long.</p>
<p>It is spent quickly, to begin its journey to its ultimate destination - the bank accounts of the wealthy elites.</p>
<p>The elites who support open borders.</p>
<p>Mass immigration is the catalyst for aggressive wealth redistribution.  From the productive citizen, wealth is unfairly taxed, to be delivered to the super-rich through the middle man in the ghetto.</p>
<p>The elites want more ghettos. Elites are pro-immigration and pro-welfare, because these are the conduits which redistribute wealth up to them.  </p>
<p>In order to create a large underclass who will never own property, financial elites lobby for open borders.  Some of the new underclass were once middle-class white Americans, forced down the economic ladder by competition in the labor market.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous wrote at 6:28 PM, it&rsquo;s white people who pay taxes.  Tax evasion is very common among East Asians.  East Asians take advantage of white people just as much as other non-white people.  East Asians are not white, kinda white or honorary white.</p>

		<p>In law school in LA I worked for a legal aid clinic.  The amount of scamming that goes on in these &#8220;communities&#8221; is astounding.  No, I mean it is truly amazing. People will actually have the chutzpah to appeal a denial of benefits when they are clearing scamming.  I mean, why not?  After all you get a FREE lawyer at any local law school.  And I mean, you are ENTITLED aren&rsquo;t you?  </p>
<p>I could count on one hand the clients I had who, IMO, truly &#8220;deserved&#8221; the benefits they were fighting for.  Oh, BTW, I had only ONE, yes ONE, client who was born and raised in the US.  Yes - ONE!  </p>
<p>You would only have to see the welfare system of California first hand in order to understand illegal immigration and anchor babies.  <br>

		<p>What this article fails to mention is the tremendous economic benefit the business community receives.  The money a welfare recipient receives is spent, never saved.  This means thousands of businesses are able to pay their rent, purchase inventory, employ individuals, and ultimately reap a profit&hellip; all from the proceeds of welfare.  Food stamps, W.I.C. vouchers, etc. are all government subsidies which ultimately put money into a store owner&rsquo;s pockets and into the community at large.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s billions of dollars being spent at the state and county level to provide janitorial and landscaping services to government buildings, cleaning litter off the roads and highways and dozens of other jobs that they could replace with welfare recipients, saving the taxpayers the cost.  Is it too much to ask that these people do a certain amount of labor every day in exchange for assistance?</p>
