<h1>Somali Militants Execute 2 Girls</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richmond Times-Dispatch, October 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Islamic group that controls much of southern Somalia executed two girls by firing squad, and hundreds of residents of a town were forced to view the spectacle.</p>
<p>Sheik Mohamed Ibrahim yesterday sentenced the girls to death in the town of Belet Weyne for spying for government soldiers fighting the Islamist group al-Shabab. The local al-Shabab administration appoints judges and the only needed qualifications are that the person must be a man who knows the Quran.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab is linked to al-Qaida and has carried out several whippings, amputations and executions to enforce its own strict interpretation of Islam. This was the first public execution of girls in Belet Weyne, a western Somali town.</p>
<p>Abdiwali Aden, a witness, told The Associated Press by phone that al-Shabab militiamen had walked through Belet Weyne&rsquo;s streets, informing residents about the pending executions by loudspeaker and ordering everyone to attend.</p>
<p>Ayan Mohamed Jama, 18, and Huriyo Ibrahim, 15, were brought before hundreds of residents. Ten masked men opened fire yesterday on the girls, who were blindfolded, soon after the sentencing. As the girls were shot, they shouted &#8220;There is no God but Allah,&#8221; said a witness who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An al-Shabab official, Sheik Yusuf Ali Ugas, said the girls had admitted to spying. But Sadia Osman, who witnessed the execution, said one of the girls said she was innocent. Ugas also warned residents against using their mobile phones or cameras to document the execution, saying violates of his rule risked amputation.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said in an April report that al-Shabab imposes &#8220;unrelenting repression and brutality.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a certain scene in &#8216;Red Dawn&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>These people are at war.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the war they prosecute is to bring their version of a &#8216;proper world&rsquo; to a nation that is too poor to fight them as equals or that their &#8216;proper world&rsquo; would be a Dark Age like none we have ever known.</p>
<p>They need to maintain opsec and this is one way they do so.</p>
<p>I have no respect for men who victimize the weak for it&rsquo;s own sake but females are effective intelligence operators for the very reason that they ARE seen as &#8216;unimportant&rsquo;, &#8216;ineffectual&rsquo; or &#8216;non-existent&rsquo; from the important events of the day.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they are.</p>
<p>But it also doesn&rsquo;t mean that they should not be treated as any less of a threat than a man caught under similar field-courted conditions (our version of such a judge would be anyone with butterbars or above with a working knowledge of the UCMJ and the Army/Marine Field Manuals, the outcome would be the exactly same for a local indigenous person).</p>
<p>Whatever form of local Animist or Islamist cult religions they followed before or after the arrival of Al Shabab, I doubt if much has changed for women, nor will it, now that the U.S. is &#8216;officially&rsquo; out of there.  Not for centuries.  Maybe not ever.  If we are not there to make that happen, we probably shouldn&rsquo;t abuse these people&rsquo;s trusts, knowing the consequences they face.  But we have to have the intel to make the black ops work there.</p>
<p>What you have to remember is that an utter contempt for a woman&rsquo;s station in life as third class menial slave and broodmare doesn&rsquo;t make the men of these groups unintelligent in detecting the likelihood of their rebellion for exactly those reasons.  They know it&rsquo;s a racket and they intend to keep it that way.  Surprise, surprise, not.</p>
<p>Indeed, they probably monitored SOF issued cellphone useage with a laptop driven receiver and/or scanned the town with NVDs to look for people that moved around after a declared curfew.  Asssuming the girls&rsquo; own mothers didn&rsquo;t rat them out &#8216;as tradition demanded&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Does this mean we should let all these victims in our lands to be protected?</p>
<p>Uhhh, no.</p>
<p>If you won&rsquo;t breed with them, for pities sake don&rsquo;t give them an irrecoverable chunk of the social welfare pie.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;There is no God but Allah,&rdquo;</p>
<p>When muslims are using the term god, they don&rsquo;t mean God from the bible.  That&rsquo;s just deception as part of jihad.</p>
<p>So, who is &#8220;allah&#8221;?  This youtube clip does a fine job of spelling out for Christians what every muslim knows but lies about hoping we&rsquo;ll let out guard down around them.</p>

		<p>The last people we executed in the US for spying were the Rosenbergs, for giving our nuclear secrets to the Soviets.  The last person we executed for desertion was some Polish kid in the 28th Division in WWII.  We are even reluctant now to execute murderers unless we have iron clad DNA evidence.  If you want to evaluate a nation&rsquo;s or society&rsquo;s justice system on the field of battle, then evaluate it based on that nation or society&rsquo;s behavior and overall justice system.  Al Queda is NOT one of your Western justice systems.  Assuming these women were heinous spies in the Western sense is wrong headed.  In the society of the fundamentalist muslim, such as Taliban and Al Queda, women have been executed for not wearing veils.  These two women could have been guilty of nothing more than merely TALKING to US or NATO troops in passing.  It affronts me to compare our UCMJ to Taliban and Al Queda &#8220;justice&#8221; in combat situations.</p>

<p>If you let them in they&rsquo;ll eventually do it here.</p>

<p>That is exactly why I will die in combat against them before I&rsquo;ll live under Muslim rule. Many Slavs died killing these Muslim invaders who invaded their lands, enslaved their women and children, and left their countries devastated wastelands. It will be no different for me,</p>

		<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care what happens to anybody in Somalia. I know this is harsh, but to me those dead girls are just two less people who can come to America and get the Red Carpet Treatment as refugees.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that our politicians will have us mixed up in that quagmire in the near future. The CIA can help them rig an election to bring  in a president that the locals don&rsquo;t support, then we can pump a trillion bucks into that land of the lost. It won&rsquo;t make any difference. No matter how many American troops get killed by going into battle wearing handcuffs, and no matter how many American politicians&rsquo; buddies we turn into billionaires, in the end Somalia will still strongly resemble the stuff in the Porta-Potties at a chili cook-off.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just give a large welfare check to the guys the Department of Defense would buy the bullets and the bombs from and keep our troops out of another pointless war that will benefit only a few  well-placed businessmen.</p>
<p>Our warbucks could be better spent on securing our borders and pacifying the enemy states that fester within all of our major cities.</p>

		<p>The no-brainer prediction here is that after these medieval goofballs have finished wrecking their country, they will be allowed here as refugees, so they can continue the same behavior.  Britain has honor-killings already, so why won&rsquo;t Lewiston Maine have stonings and beheadings?<br>

		<p>If we let Somolis and Muslims in to the USA, that is what they will do here. I agree, as harsh as it sounds, let the townfolk rise up in revolt against their rulers. It just isn&rsquo;t our job to fight this war, and end up importing even more Somolis. </p>

		<p>Note how as the girls were being executed they shouted out &#8220;there is no god but Allah&#8221;, even though Islam was the very thing responsible for causing their deaths. Stupid is as stupid does&hellip;</p>
