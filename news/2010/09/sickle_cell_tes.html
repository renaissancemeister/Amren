			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Stein, Washington Post, September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. colleges and universities for the first time are requiring top student athletes to submit to testing for the gene for sickle cell anemia, a mandate aimed at preventing sudden deaths of promising young players but stirring deep fears about reviving dangerous old prejudices.</p>
<p>The screening hopes to identify athletes at high risk for life-threatening complications from intense physical exertion. That way, those with the gene could be monitored more closely and their training could be modified by, for example, allowing more time for rest and drinking more water.</p>
<p>But the prerequisite is evoking some of the most notorious episodes in the nation&rsquo;s history. While less known than the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment, for decades blacks were stigmatized by sickle cell because they carried it far more commonly than whites, marking them as supposedly genetically inferior, barring them from jobs, the military, insurance and even discouraging them from marrying and having children.</p>
<p>&#8220;This amounts to a massive genetic screening program, with tens of thousands being screened,&#8221; said Troy Duster, a professor of sociology at New York University who studies the racial implications of science. &#8220;This could have an extraordinarily heavy impact on black athletes. You are going to be picking out these kids and saying, &#8216;You are going to be scrutinized more closely than anyone else.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s worrisome.&#8221;</p>
<p>The testing is being watched closely as a case study in both the potential benefits and risks of large-scale modern genetic screening, which is proliferating as the genetic bases for more and more diseases are being deciphered.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although endorsed by some doctors, sports officials, athletes and parents, the testing has raised objections from both the Sickle Cell Anemia Association of America and a federal panel that advises the government on issues related to genetic testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re very concerned that identifying someone as a carrier could be discriminatory,&#8221; said R. Rodney Howell, who chairs the Health and Human Services Department&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, which sent a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in June expressing concern about the program. &#8220;There is no need to single out this group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association mandated the testing in April in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of Dale Lloyd II, a 19-year-old African American freshman at Rice University who died after an intense football workout in 2006 and was later discovered to have had the sickle cell trait.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to prevent this from happening to anyone else,&#8221; said Lloyd&rsquo;s mother, Bridgette Lloyd of Houston. &#8220;Coaches and trainers need this knowledge. We don&rsquo;t want another young person to lose their life because of a lack of information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the policy, as of Aug. 1 all new students joining NCAA Division I teams, regardless of race, must be tested for the sickle cell trait  &mdash;  a requirement affecting about 170,000 student-athletes. No one will be excluded from sports or restricted in training or playing based on the results, officials said. Rather, athletes who test positive will be conditioned more carefully and watched more closely to ensure they drink enough and avoid overexertion, especially on hot days and in high altitudes. The NCAA is considering expanding the testing to Division II and III players, which would extend the order to about 260,000 more students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A person born with two copies of the gene gets the illness. People who carry only one  &mdash;  known as having the sickle cell trait  &mdash;  are generally healthy. But during highly stressful physical exertion their blood cells can become sickle-shaped, preventing the delivery of oxygen to tissues and organs. Since 2000, as many as 10 Division I college football players who had the trait without knowing it have died suddenly following workouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been players who cease activity on a hot day because of complaints of fatigue  &mdash;  they are sweating heavily and cramping and not understanding the evidence of sickling. Those cases have been managed as exertional heat illness  &mdash;  and it wasn&rsquo;t, with tragic consequences,&#8221; said Scott A. Anderson, head athletic trainer at the University of Oklahoma, who has spearheaded the drive for testing. &#8220;The more you know, the better the athlete can protect themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to protect people, there&rsquo;s an easy way to do that: change the training protocol for everyone,&#8221; said Lanetta Jordan, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America&rsquo;s chief medical officer.</p>

<p>Really?  And from what crack dream did the <i>Washington Post&rsquo;s </i> Rob Stein draw this &#8220;fact?&#8221;  Even before I was racially aware, I knew that blacks were far more prone to sickle-cell anemia.  But I never encountered anyone, anywhere who considered this susceptibility to be any sort of mark of inferiority.</p>
<p>Rob Stein&rsquo;s fantasy rolls along&hellip;:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;barring them from jobs, the military, insurance and even discouraging them from marrying and having children.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see some documented statistics of blacks being barred from &#8220;jobs, military or insurance&#8221; because of a genetic predisposition to sickle-cell anemia before pushing out absurd claims, okay, Rob?  And as for &#8220;marrying and having children&hellip;&#8221;  Well, let&rsquo;s just say that the majority of blacks don&rsquo;t associate the two in the first place.</p>
<p>I wonder if Rob Stein considers it &#8220;racism&#8221; to take steps toward alleviating Tay-Sachs disease in Jews?<br>

		<p>&#8220;the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment,&#8221;</p>
<p>There they go again. The &#8220;experiment&#8221; they call it.</p>
<p>NOT an experiment, a study. And I am not merely being pedantic here.</p>
<p>An experiment suggests action, a study suggest passivity.</p>
<p>Words have meaning. </p>
<p>This was a STUDY and not an experiment.</p>
<p>And those &#8220;victims&#8221; could not be helped then, could not even be helped now. Had the disease established in the spinal column and nothing can be done in that case to &#8220;cure&#8221; the patient. NOT then, NOT now. </p>
<p>This myth of an &#8220;experiment&#8221; persists and probably always will now. There never was an &#8220;experiment&#8221; as that word is generally, commonly and ordinarily understood. A STUDY STUDY STUDY!</p>
<p>The BIG LIE at work most unfortunately. The BIG LIE does work.</p>
<p>And again and again, MOST blacks in the U.S. have no idea what the Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221; was in first place. It is not even on their &#8220;radar screen&#8221;!</p>

Yet another example of how pointless it is to help blacks.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you do, you will be vilified.</p>
<p>You put blacks at risk for not testing them for sickle cell, you&rsquo;re a racist who doesn&rsquo;t care about blacks.</p>
<p>You test blacks for sickle cell to screen them for potentially life threatening complications, you&rsquo;re a racist out to destroy the careers of black athletes.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win. Helping blacks means getting slapped down.<br>

		<p>No problem.  If you choose to opt out of the test then you must sign a waiver of liability for the school.  If the consequences of death over knowledge of the test&rsquo;s results is one&rsquo;s credo, then ultimately Darwinism will resolve the issue.  <br>
As an aside, sickle cell is also found in Mediterranean populations, in particular Sicilian Italians.</p>

<p> Actually, the true sickle cell trait is found only or mostly in sub-Saharan African populations  There is another related disease  - alpha thalassemia, known as Cooley&rsquo;s anemia - which is common throughout the Mediterranean, and is believed to confer protection against malaria. Beta-thalassemia is found, I believe, in Southeast Asian populations.</p>

		<p>I remember in the early 1970&rsquo;s, Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates was telling broadcaster Jack Brickhouse about sickle cell anemia, and how he urged Bantus in the Pittsburgh area to get tested for sickle cell anemia. Brickhouse asked him, &#8220;Willie, what is sickle cell anemia&#8221;, and Stargell said &#8220;It&rsquo;s a disease that kills black people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bantus always say that more money must be spent to fight diseases that afflict primarily Bantus, like AIDS, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Yet, they feel &#8220;stigmatized&#8221; by sickle cell anemia. The worst part is the whites who feel the same way, and so must test all the whites, Hispanics, Bantus and Orientals, so as not to be perceived as &#8220;racist&#8221;. That is stupid and pointless.</p>
<p>How come Jews do not feel &#8220;stigmatized&#8221; by Tay-Sachs disease, the Bantus do over sickle cell?  After all, they, like Bantus were slaves, and are regarded as a &#8220;persecuted minority&#8221; in the U.S.  </p>
