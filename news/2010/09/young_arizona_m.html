<h1>Young Arizona Mayor Accused of Taking Bribes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mayor of Nogales, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on charges he took bribes to protect contracts or obtain business contracts with the city, the state attorney general said.</p>
<p>Octavio Garcia-Von Borstel, 29, of Nogales, was arrested at his office at city hall, according to the Arizona attorney general&rsquo;s office, which announced the arrest and an indictment on state charges. {snip}</p>
<p>The mayor is also accused of money laundering, conflict of interest, illegally conducting an enterprise and fraud.</p>
<p>The mayor&rsquo;s father, Octavio Garcia Suarez, 59, of Nogales, also was indicted and arrested. He faces several charges that include fraud, theft and money laundering, the attorney general&rsquo;s statement indicated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the statement, FBI agents began investigating Garcia-Von Borstel five months ago and determined that he was soliciting Nogales businesses to hire him as a business consultant as early as February 2009. At least one business admitted to the FBI that it was paying the mayor to use his official position to obtain business contracts and, specifically, to obtain new city of Nogales contracts, the attorney general stated.</p>
<p>Further investigation determined the mayor also received money from at least one business in exchange for utilizing his official position to protect a contract the business owner had with the city and to assist the business owner in obtaining an additional city contract, added Goddard, who is running for governor.</p>
<p>The indictment cites $4,000 and $2,000 payments, without providing details.</p>
<p>The mayor&rsquo;s father, Garcia Suarez, was an agent for Western Union authorized to sell Western Union money orders from his money transmitter business, ACE Cash Express, in Nogales, officials said. The state alleges that Garcia Suarez fraudulently reported that Western Union money orders worth $3.2 million were sold, although there were no cash deposits to back them up.</p>
<p>The money orders were then cashed by Garcia-Von Borstel and deposited into a bank account he controlled, the statement said. Of the $3.2 million, the father and son withdrew $565,000 for their personal use before the account was frozen, it said.</p>

<p>This couldn&rsquo;t have happened to a nicer firm than WU.  A few years ago, they closed all their non-management American operations, their financial services offices in St. Louis, their English-speaking call center in St. Louis, and their Spanish-speaking call center in Dallas, and moved it all to Costa Rica, where the wages are like 5% for what the comparable American employees made.</p>
<p>And of course, WU&rsquo;s business in the last decade or so was almost exclusively focused on helping Mexicans remit money back to Mexico.  They were as big on amnesty and open borders as any other corporation, just to have as many Mexicans on both side of the &#8220;border&#8221; as possible to have as many remittances as possible.</p>
<p>WU wanted to lie down in this bed, now it has to make it.</p>

		<p>I will wager there is NOT ONE black or Mexican or any other nonwhite that holds office or is anywhere near White taxpayer dollars that does not commit fraud, theft or embezzlement. </p>
<p> We have all read about the fraud by foreign doctors, medical supply companies, etc that has ripped off the medicare and medical programs for BILLIONS!</p>

		<p>Ah, once again hispanics remind us of the wonderful contributions they bring to the US.  Nothing rings of a healthy, diverse community more than committing fraud and embezzlement.</p>

<p>  I knew none of this before your post, QD, and I already thought that WU should have been shut down ages ago. What are they if not a money-laundering organization? I&rsquo;ve seen their ads all over the web, courting the &#8220;business&#8221; of the &#8220;new arrivals&#8221;.<br>
It&rsquo;s enough to gag a buzzard. I hope this makes enough of a mess to force whatever agency has been averting their eyes to all of this to take action.</p>
