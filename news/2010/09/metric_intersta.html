<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Distance along I-19 is measured in kilometers, just as it is in Mexico. That means highway markers advise that there are three kilometers until the next gas station, four until the next rest stop, seven until the next desert town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Transportation says the 400 signs along the I-19&rsquo;s 100 kilometers are too old and need to be replaced. The new signs, officials say, would be like all the others in the state and would indicate distance in miles. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some who live along I-19 do not particularly care for the signs, saying they look foreign, are confusing and serve no purpose now that the United States has decided not to give an inch to the metric system.</p>

		<p>There were two theories on why I-19 got metric signage to begin with:  One was that I-19 only goes from Tucson to the Mexican border, leading to a country that only uses metric.  Two was that I-19 was finished during the height of the &#8220;metric fad,&#8221; which quickly fizzled out.  But not until I-19 was opened, and the state gave in to it.</p>

You can&rsquo;t avoid metric units in the United States anymore.  If you don&rsquo;t speak metric, then you aren&rsquo;t participating in our economy.  Or, your participation is insignificant and in an industry where America has fallen behind every other country in the world, such as paper.<p></p></p></p>

		<p>Personally, I have always wondered HOW America came to have a measuring system with a base of 12! we have 10 fingers, 10 toes and when we would count we would count to 10 fingers and start over! Metric is a base of 10 and makes sense, but again, personally, F the metric system, stay AMERICAN and keep &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221; on our money.</p>

<p>OUR roads DO NOT need to be marked in kilometers.  We do not EXPORT roads.  Roads within the borders of the United States can be marked in miles or yards if we so choose.  Items produced for sale overseas, fine, mark them in meters or what have you but for distance or speed or for that matter builings that exist within the confines of the US the standard system is just fine.</p>
<p>I might also point out that we put a man on the moon using the good old foot-pound system.  And if learning two langauges is so wonderful what is wrong with learning two measurement systems? </p>
<p>The two (formerly) greatest empires on Earth, Britain and the US, used the standard system at the height of their powers.  Maybe having to remember 12 inches = 1 foot and 3 feet = 1 yard is more cumbersome and actually forces the brain to work harder and thus smarter!  Although I never had a problem with our traditional system.  Now excuse me while I go to the store to buy 128 oz of milk!</p>

		<p>Arthur (#2) makes a great point. The &#8220;imperial&#8221; system of weights and measures is a relic of British colonialism. Worse, it costs the economy billions of dollars in lost productivity as companies doing business overseas have to use one system domestically and one for the rest of the world. The metric system, since it&rsquo;s based on the number 10, is natural and easy to learn. It&rsquo;s even interchangeable between different types of materials. For example, if you melt an ice cube with a volume of 1 cubic centimeter, you get 1 milliliter of water. So 1000 cc = 1 liter.</p>
<p>After the breakup of the US, the states, confederations or alliances that recover the quickest will be the ones that ditch the outdated imperial system in favor of metric.</p>

		<p>How interesting, the (liberal) metric movement of the 1970s had a (government funded) foothold in Arizona, and they never corrected it until now.  They should use stimulus funds for this!  I remember &#8220;them&#8221; trying that &#8220;elsewhere&#8221; and after a year of public outcry the highway department put the miles-per-hour and mile marker signs back up.</p>
<p>Do you still have your cookbooks and measuring utensils in metric?  Homemakers said they didn&rsquo;t want to learn a new language and blamed the metric system on their already bad cooking.</p>
<p>And how soon you all forgot when gas pumps went to liters and drivers across America said they were getting ripped off because they didn&rsquo;t know if they were getting a good price, per gallon.<br>

<p>We &#8220;speak metric&#8221; just fine when the need arises.  And the last time I checked there isn&rsquo;t any aspect of economics where Americans are &#8220;insignificant.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you may have a point.  We might have been able to put a man on the moon ahead of all of those more sophisticated nations had it not been for our stubborn usage of antiquated measurements.</p>

		<p>I disagree with comments that the USA should go metric. We&rsquo;ve always used miles etc. What is the point of changing it to meters? So other countries do it, let them. All you are talking about is what to call a certain amount of distance, whether it is so many miles or meters,  same thing. Why change, if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</p>

<p>In fact, NASA went metric during the 1960s, no doubt to simplify communication with observatories and relay stations around the world, and to make building those huge rockets more straightforward.</p>

		<p>The metric system (based on powers of ten) is very useful in the physical sciences; it simplifies a lot of the math. But for everyday life, a system based on halves, quarters, &c; (powers of two) is usually more convenient, and that&rsquo;s what I like about the English system. But, they&rsquo;re just tools. To learn them both, and decide on a case by case basis which one to use, is the best approach. Also, one should consider the Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight system of weights and measures, especially for use on physics exams. </p>

		<p>I personally hate using metrics in every day use. Whenever I travel abroad, I have to convert everything in my head to &#8220;real units&#8221;. I do hate using the imperial system in engineering applications. If you have ever studied thermodynamics, the use of the imperial system is truly horrifying. It&rsquo;s not just pounds and feet, but you have to learn units such as slugs and dynes&hellip;and many others that you could only imagine in nightmares. Thermodynamics is a dream in the metric system, but a horror in imperial. Sorry about that. I still only want to see miles and yards on our U.S. freeways. it&rsquo;s tradition. We&rsquo;re not Europe.</p>

		<p>All of the highways and other public infrastructure projects are designed and planned in metric units anyway.  No modern engineering is done in imperial units anymore, even in the United States.<p><br>
So that means everyone who goes to University has to unlearn the silly units we have and learn to think metric.  And then switch back and forth when coming and going from work because we have to meet the least common denominator of people who never learned what a meter is.<p><br>
And then what if you want to share an engineering drawing with your customer or supplier overseas?  You can&rsquo;t send it on letter paper because they can&rsquo;t print it.  And then you can&rsquo;t print it on A4 paper to verify it, because you don&rsquo;t have any A4 paper.  If you print it on the wrong paper, it&rsquo;s the wrong size.<p><br>
And then what if you have more than one vendor or supplier and you need to share drawings?  Fine!  Oh wait, one machine shop speaks in Mils while the other is in Millimeters!  So you have to spend time updating the drawing and introduce a risk of error.  No thanks, I&rsquo;ll just use another vendor in China, it&rsquo;s cheaper to do all of the work there.<p><br>
Finally the paper size becomes a problem again when the product is delivered and the customer can&rsquo;t file Letter pages because his A4 files are meant for paper that is slightly skinnier.<p><br>
I&rsquo;m not sure about NASA, historically, but I do know that at the present time, all their works are done in metric units.  Bringing up the Atomic Bomb or the Moon Landing is not really fair.  At the time most people here were engineering in inch-pounds, and the USA was the leading industrial and scientific powerhouse.  But back then, automobiles and farm machinery were engineered in inch-pounds, too.  All of that has changed.  It is difficult and expensive to buy a car here, today that is not made in the USA.  And just about every fastener on every Chevrolet or John Deere you buy will be metric.  And the people who drew every single part defined their dimensions in millimeters.<p><br>
My business is unique in that most of my revenue is profit.  My outsourced, offshored manufacturing costs represent a very small fraction of revenue.  So, most of the money I bring in stays here.  Most other businesses run on much smaller margins, and when they are faced with a choice about where to outsource, it more greatly affects the distribution of their turnover.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

		<p>Regarding the ability to export, the standard in most countries (i.e., those that protect their markets) is to make it difficult to enter their market and/or segment markets. For example, there are many formats for DVDs according to region; and, for example, cars are sold in different countries with required lighting and/or other supposed safety features required, etc. Why not one format for DVDs for the whole globe; why not one type of Toyota Camry for every country; why not metric in the U.S., etc.? Whoever wrote complaining about not being able to export because metric is used in most countries must be kidding. In order to make one exporter of whatever happy, do you want to export multiples of the jobs he might claim to be able to create. Relative to every country I have visited, the U.S. has the least barriers to entry to its markets (i.e., is the easiest market to penetrate), and that is a large part of the reason it has exported millions of jobs. Do we really need to make it easier to export more jobs so some whiner can make more theoretical sales overseas for his own profit?</p>
<p>Therefore, sure make it metric, but make sure other countries standardize everything else so we can have equal and &lsquo;fair&rsquo; access to their markets. No more one off pulling down barriers without making sure everyone else is also doing the same. <br>

		<p>We changed to th metric system here back in the 70s, you get used to it and many imperial units are now totally forgotten. BUT, regarding the man on the moon, they got there because America still BELIEVED IN ITSELF back then, not because of the measurement units in use.<br>
Even in the USA metric units are everywhere, eg. volts &amp; amps for electricity. Also, in the next Olympics your Athletes and swimmers  will hopefully do very well whether it be the 100 meter sprint or a 1500 meter swimming event!</p>

		<p>If the decimal system is that easy and of the utmost importance to our economy, why worldwide a duodecimal system is still used to measure time? Time measurement is more important in international contacts and collaboration, it plays a bigger role in lots of human and scientific activities than measurement of distance.</p>
