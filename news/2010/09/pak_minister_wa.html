<h1><a href="http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4337606">Pak Minister Wants Obama to Be &#8220;Leader of All Muslims&#8221;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSN News India, Sept. 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Pakistani minister wants US President Barack Obama to offer Eid prayers at Ground Zero in New York and become the &#8220;Amir-ul-Momineen&#8221; or Caliph of Muslims.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Industries Ayatullah Durrani, who belongs to the ruling Pakistan People&#8221;s Party, said the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr festival, expected to be observed on September 11, would be a &#8220;golden opportunity&#8221; for Obama to offer Eid prayers and declare himself the leader of all Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way, all the problems of the Muslim world would be solved,&#8221; Durrani told The Nation newspaper.</p>
<p>Durrani, a former member of the Pakistan Ideological Council, contended that the Muslim world is in &#8220;dire need&#8221; of a Caliph and occupying this distinguished slot would provide Obama &#8220;exemplary titles&#8221; like &#8220;Mullah Barack Hussain Obama&#8221; or &#8220;Allama Obama&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The time is approaching fast. Barack Hussain Obama must act now. This is a golden opportunity, Muslims badly need it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Obama&#8221;s elevation to the Islamic Caliphate would be the &#8220;key to success,&#8221; he claimed but did not offer any explanation for his remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ground Zero&#8221; is the former site of the fallen twin towers of the World Trade Center.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.  You mean he&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;In this way, all the problems of the Muslim world would be solved,&rdquo; Durrani told The Nation newspaper.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the &#8220;solution,&#8221; it makes one wonder what he perceives the problems of the Moslem world to be.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t help wondering if the Big Chief doesn&rsquo;t entertain such secret fantasies himself.  Personally, I&rsquo;d love to see him declare himself Caliph.  Even the most dull-witted White liberal could hardly avoid facing the obvious, then.</p>
<p>Or, maybe not&hellip;<br>

		<p>&#8220;the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr festival, expected to be observed on September 11:</p>
<p>I believe the Eid is the end of Ramadan? And this year on 9/11? Whoa! Could be some big thing in NYC that take place on that date? The mosque folks will want to make a scene and have prayers and such?</p>
<p>Well, the Muslims throughout the world do SEE O as a Muslim, according to Islamic law, which is correct. Any child born of a Muslim parent is a Muslim, forever and ever. </p>
<p>It would be only natural for them to expect him to make a big move toward the faith and assume the role of caliph, which is what most of them hope and pray for, even though they would deny it.</p>
<p>Maybe some Muslim who read this can respond? I hope someone does.</p>

		<p>Oh for crying out loud DON&rsquo;T TEMPT HIM.  I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s already thinking about it seriously, since he can be pretty sure he&rsquo;s a one term-er.  Terrible choice to put on the man.  Hmm.  Argh.  What do I do?  Which do I choose?  Anti-Christ over the whole world, or Caliph over all muslims?</p>

&#8220;shhhhh, not yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>But seriously I almost wish this would happen, as it would (hopefully) make a lot of people open up their eyes. </p>

		<p>This shows a profound difference in the way third worlders think, a difference which is fundamental to why they live in what we call &#8220;third world&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The anti-whites preach constantly that the dreadful living conditions of the third world are the fault of mean, oppressive whites in developed countries, whose every comfort comes at the expense of the third world.  They never explain just how it is that rich countries get rich by stealing from the poor.  </p>
<p>To elaborate: the poor, by definition, don&rsquo;t have much.  There is no getting a lot by taking a little.  You will not buy a mansion and an airplane with the loot gained by robbing a homeless bum.  </p>
<p>First world countries are rich because we CREATE wealth.  With our intelligence, creativeness and industriousness, we solve problems.  </p>
<p>This argument is for white people.  You will not make a third-worlder into a productive, first world citizen by explaining this to him.  You are wasting your breath when you try to explain it to third worlders, because they just don&rsquo;t think the same way.  They can&rsquo;t. If they could, they would do so already and build their own airplanes, spaceships, hospitals and universities.  Or at least grow their own food.  Third worlders rely more on &#8220;magical thinking&#8221; than on logic. </p>
<p>Third worlders can do no better than rely on a &#8220;big man&#8221; who will work his magic and solve their problems.  </p>
<p>The PC religion insists that all of mankind is essentially the same.  All the evidence says the opposite.    <br>

		<p>&#8216;Making Obama caliph would &ldquo;solve all the problems of the Muslim world.&rdquo; &#8216;</p>
<p>Quite true, but the recipients of the greatest benefits would be the US, assuming of course that Obama resigns and moves closer to Mecca to be closer to his Muslim religion. </p>
<p>He can use his Kenyan birth certificate to prove his father was a Muslim and according to the Koran the lineage automatically is passed on to the son.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting idea which should be considered.</p>
<p>&#8216;Part two&rsquo; would involve whites breaking away from the new Caliphate.  Obama could move his offices and his followers to Morocco.  </p>
<p>U.S. whites could found a second Republic based on the original constitution. </p>
<p>A win-win for everyone. </p>

		<p>IF Obie was declared Khalifah by even a small majority of worldwide Muslim organizations, HE&rsquo;D BE CALIPH even after he publically refused and not just because his public refusal would be seen as pandering to the infidel electorate either. Then the media will float the idea &#8216;impartially&rsquo; to the public until the shock wears off. Then Obie WILL lead Eid prayers one year, followed by more media &#8216;impartiality&rsquo; until Blacks convert en mass giving Dubai &amp; S. Arabia control of the American electorate.</p>

		<p>Readers of Amren should seriously consider that Obama is NOT, in fact, a muslim.  I mean, he is, but in the sense that members of the Nation of Islam and other hate groups are &#8220;muslims&#8221;.  They aren&rsquo;t legitimate believers of the ideology nor are they connected with other muslims.  It&rsquo;s just a vehicle for identity politics.  More to the point, identity politics itself is just a vehicle for what Obama and those pulling his strings, want to do.  They don&rsquo;t actually believe any of that stuff.  That&rsquo;s for the sheeple to believe.  A way to manipulate the very worst of the brainwashed and stupid.</p>
<p>My point is this.  Knowing this.  Is the guy who suggests this actually someone who works for Obama.  Rather than being a real muslim who thinks Obama is a muslim infiltrator that has conquered America in the name of Islam, is this guy someone who just wants to convince muslims that is the case.  Muslims have been indoctrinated for hundreds of years to SUBMIT, without question to a caliphate.  Of course, the leaders don&rsquo;t actually believe in the religious part of islam.  The whole thing has always been a scam to control enslaved peoples.  Kill the parents and the slave children will believe anything you tell them and forget (or rather are never taught) facts like they are really christian peoples.</p>
<p>I can easily see how someone like Obama, who is nowhere near as stupid and incompetent as he appears to be (something he learned from Bush), would take advantage of people even MORE brainwashed and enslaved than whites.  What better way to end the war between the west and islam, and get them to do whatever he tells them by simply allowing them to believe that they won.</p>
<p>Become REALLY concerned if you start to seeing muslims the world over bow to the west instead of the middle east, several times a day.</p>
<p>Obama is not even the first neo-fascist to try this.  There was a REASON the Grand Mufti spent WWII in Germany.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the people of Pakistan and Kenya, countries not known for high IQ&rsquo;s, have our our illustrious leader figured out, but we highly intelligent Americans are still arguing about his loyalties? It appears that our information filters are clogged up and need to be replaced.</p>

		<p>Ah, if only Prez Hussein would take Minister Durrani&rsquo;s sage advice. It would reveal to even his naive white liberal supporters where he really is. </p>
<p>Hussein however is cunning. His Communist ancestry (momma, grandparents and daddy) has taught him to be progressive without openly appearing to be interested in seizing total power, either as an Isalmist or as a Marxist. If he could, he would.</p>

		<p>There are certainly some mixed messages on this post. Obviously there must be a lot of people out there who are convinced BHO is a Muslim. But BHO has intimated to the American people that he is a Christian, where is truth??<br>
If he is Muslim and has converted to Christianity he will be under death threat from the Islamic authorities.<br>
If he has really converted to Christianity perhaps he can reassure the American people of this by presenting his baptisimal and church membership certificates, as simple as that! (Just like that mystery birth certificate)</p>

		<p>This is a very curious statement for an imam to make about an ex-Muslim who had himself baptised as a Christian and who raised two daughters as Christians.  I thought the punishment for apostacy in Islam was death by beheading, rather than ascension to the Caliphate.  Could someone help me out on this?</p>
