			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Partner, AnglingTimes (Peterborough, UK), September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five words, tiny sentence, huge question. Is angling a racist sport?</p>
<p>I urge you to think hard before you answer. Very hard. I want you to think about the number of black and Asian people you see on the bank, about how many ethnic minority stars appear in the fishing press, about the tackle shops, the fisheries, the matches, the shows. Think about wherever groups of anglers congregate. Think about the number of non-white faces you&rsquo;re likely to see. Then answer the question.</p>
<p>Because even if angling isn&rsquo;t overtly racist, then it&rsquo;s a hobby that has failed to integrate what now amounts to a significant proportion of the UK population. And that&rsquo;s not opinion. It&rsquo;s indisputable, undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Fishing, whichever way you look at it, remains, overwhelmingly, the preserve of white, middle-aged, working class males.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not alone, of course. The two other field sports to which it sits most closely  &mdash;  shooting and, to a lesser degree, hunting  &mdash;  have a similar demographic. Yes, the social class may change, but the skin colour doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you take part in a countryside pursuit, the odds are you&rsquo;ll be white.</p>
<p>There are obvious, often quoted, answers here. Ethnic communities live in cities and rarely leave their urban environments. They are poor, too, and unable to either afford the time, or the equipment, that hobbies demand. But these, although legitimate factors, are far too simplistic in my opinion.</p>
<p>Angling, like the other outdoor pursuits already mentioned, doesn&rsquo;t attract blacks or Asians because of fundamental cultural differences.</p>
<p>Think about it. How did you find your love of angling? The overwhelming answer surely is through fathers, grandfathers or other family relatives.</p>
<p>A significant portion may have friends to thank but there can&rsquo;t be many who simply stumbled into it by chance. Without those influences to steer them in the sport&rsquo;s direction, most within the ethnic community don&rsquo;t grow up with opportunity or inclination to pick up a fishing rod.</p>
<p>As a consequence there remains a dearth of role models for these youngsters to aspire to. Unlike football, cricket, rugby, golf even, fishing has no black or Asian superstars  &mdash;  and there isn&rsquo;t a hope in hell in finding any in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency believe that of the 1.45m rod licences sold last year, one per cent was made up of people from the ethnic community. It continues to spend revenue  &mdash;  raised via our contributions  &mdash;  on schemes and initiatives to increase that number because, and I quote a source at the Agency, &#8216;we know that literally millions more people from all backgrounds are interested in going fishing but also that they find significant barriers in their way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the Agency&rsquo;s &#8216;Angling 2015&rsquo;, a scheme aimed at attracting 200,000 new people into fishing, a significant portion from the vast ethnic community. Already money, our rod licence money, remember, has been spent on pilot schemes with organisations  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m not making this up  &mdash;  like the Minority Ethnic Women&rsquo;s Network. This at a time when the EA can&rsquo;t afford to bailiff the banks properly.</p>
<p>Look, it might be very worthy and politically correct to seek to throw money at well-meaning but ultimately doomed attempts to encourage blacks and Asians to go fishing, but it&rsquo;s futile.</p>
<p>Fishing, to answer my own initial question, isn&rsquo;t racist. But it is white, working class and an intrinsic part of Anglo Saxon culture that dates back centuries. The EA would be well advised to remember that the next time it decides to throw even more of our money away.<br>

<p>NO, it is NOT  &#8220;worthy&#8221; to throw money for any &#8220;well meaning&#8221; attempt to encourage Asians and blacks to go fishing!!!  Leave Whites alone!  That is about all we have that the blacks and nonwhites haven&rsquo;t invaded in the things we enjoy! ALL sports have been taken over by nonwhites and going to where these same nonwhites fill the stadiums, etc. is nothing but chaos, crimes, fighting and violence. Can you just see these blacks and what they will do to the Whites out there fishing or in their boats? Can you just see the litter and the pollution of the rivers as we all know what they will use it for. </p>

		<p>Whites who enjoy leisure and sports are the problem.  Our Enemy Ethnic groups are busy making plans to take over America while we make plans to go fishing. When we come home from fishing, we sit on the sofa drinking beer and watching blacks on TV dribble the ball receive eager hugs from White cheerleaders in short skirts.  We are more interested in our &#8220;standard of living&#8221; than in really getting involved to fight against those who are destroying everything.  </p>

		<p>This whole idea that whites have to &#8220;encourage&#8221; blacks to take part in various activities is all part of the paternalistic, &#8220;we know better than you do&#8221; disguised &#8220;racism&#8221; of the liberals. Once again, blacks are mere puppets who have to be &#8220;shown the way&#8221; by all-knowing, all-wise white men, instead of autonomous beings who are perfectly capable of deciding for themselves what activities they want to engage in. </p>
<p>Now the paternalistic mindset is being extended to &#8220;Asians&#8221; as well. Who made whites the arbiters of what activities are good and should be engaged in by non-whites? More disguised liberal racism.</p>

		<p>So anything that is practiced primarily by people of one race is inherently &#8220;racist&#8221;?  Is that the twisted logic here?  Even when the answer is simple:  if UK black and &#8220;Asians&#8221; (Pakistanis) want to go fishing, they can do so.  Nothing and no one is stopping them.  They just don&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s not part of their culture.  </p>
<p>I thought &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; meant more than one culture.  But whatever the white culture does, like fishing, must always be called &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>

<p>I am glad shooting [firearms] still has such a favorable demographic. I am glad that is so. Appleseed! Look it up if you are a shootist. Trains riflemen. And the criticism is that IT IS ALMOST ALL WHITE!! So says the New York Times. This is a criticism?? If the New York Times says it is so - - well, it must be so then!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Think about wherever groups of anglers congregate. Think about the number of non-white faces you&rsquo;re likely to see.&#8221; O.K., I&rsquo;ve thought about it. I think about the peace and quiet, no imagined sleights, no loud arrogant chattering not caring about anyone else but  themselves, no chasing bay-bays around getting into other fishermen&rsquo;s personal property, no littering, and best of all, NO faces that don&rsquo;t look like mine. :-) Just the way I like it.</p>

		<p>In this context diversity means no white people.  The British people are sick in the head.  They want to be replaced by non-white people.  Many sports that originated in Great Britain the British people are no longer competitive in or have non-British people playing for them like soccer, table tennis, tennis, cricket, and badminton.  You can see the decline of Great Britain with the results they get in sports and the increasing number of non-British athletes playing for Great Britain.  East Asians have dominated table tennis for the last 60 years.  Same goes for badminton.  Great Britain loves to fill their soccer teams with African and Middle Eastern players.  Cricket has been dominated by India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand for awhile.  A British man hasn&rsquo;t won a grand slam tournament in decades and there are no British women in the top 100.</p>

		<p>In most countries this would be a satire piece.  Not the case in the UK.  If the right anti-white British social/governmental groups seize upon this obvious racist activity look for it to be banned.  Any white British would face jailtime if he is seen fishing.  A white guy just got arrested for a &#8220;racist&#8221; ringtone a few days ago, they aren&rsquo;t that far away from this scenario in reality. </p>

		<p>Attitudes towards fishing reflect broader values.</p>
<p>In Canada, Asians are suspected of abusing sport fishing licenses. </p>
<p>It is said they drive out of the cities to rural fishing spots, catch more than the legal limit, pack the fish on ice, and run them back to the city to be sold in markets or on restaurant tables.</p>
<p>Blacks mainly live in the urban setting. If they&rsquo;re hungry, they can obtain food from one of the charitable food banks. They don&rsquo;t fish as a leisure activity.</p>

		<p>Only in the U.K. can pc be taken to THIS extreme. </p>
<p>Integrating a largely white sport may seem harmless to citizens of a country where 92% of the population is white. Here in the U.S., however, rodeos, hockey games and NASCAR races are appealing in part because there aren&rsquo;t groups of blacks loitering about. I truly believe this is also why commercial country music has become more popular in the last 20 years. </p>

Blacks and Asians don&rsquo;t like being out in nature. Why is this so difficult to accept? Good heavens, blacks can&rsquo;t stand rain. Have you ever seen blacks reacting to rain? You&rsquo;d think the sky was pouring down acid.</p>
<p>Black refugees flee Africa because they don&rsquo;t like living their lives in tents and flimsy housing made of discarded materials. Why would anyone believe that when they entered a first world nation they would want to live they life they left?<br>

		<p>Trust me, you do not want to encourage more Asians to fish.  They strip mine the fish, respecting no season and size laws or catch limits.  They rape the resources as they did in their countries of origin.  They treat fish resources as they treat us, to be used for their benefit until the source is exhausted.</p>

<p>Oh, thank God he ended it with this statement. All throughout the article, I was wondering who told this idiot he could write magazine articles. I mean, at first it sounded like he was suggesting that fishing is rascist simply because 99% of fishers are white, and that the British government is right in spending tax money on bringing &#8220;ethnics&#8221; into the hobby of fishing (angling). But, then he ends with a couple of sensible statemnts about how fishing is not rascist, it is simply an integral part of ANGLO-SAXON culture, and not of most foreign cultures.</p>

		<p>Why is any of this news, exactly? If the writer wants to see Bantus and Asians hunt and fish, why TF doesn&rsquo;t he go to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, or India to see how people there hunt? It seems to me, like he&rsquo;s indicting outdoor sports like hunting and fishing as racist, on the one hand; and then backpedals on the other, saying it&rsquo;s a waste of time spending money to get heretofore disinterested minorities into outdoor sports like fishing and hunting.</p>

<p>Absolute rubbish. In England much fishing is done by the canal banks,and  one of the longest canals in England is the Grand Union which snakes through some of the most urban and &#8216;cosmopolitian&rsquo;  areas of the country you can think of. And what about the River Thames; thanks to fifty years of  black and Asian immigration very few would have to go far from their respective aareas to  find a piece  where they were able to  cast a rod. This is just another of those silly articles, written by some guilty white do gooder, with too much time on his hands with the intention  to criminalise innnocent white  people (many of whom probably have abolutely no interest in politics, racial or otherwise) and to attack anything exclusively white. (Where is it all going to end?)  As for being poor, so was Huckleberry Finn, but he did well enough  with  a stick, a piece of string  and  a pin. In any case  you can buy starter kits and rods for about the price of two packets of  cigarettes these days. And let&rsquo;s  face it, since when was being poor ever a factor in holding non whites back from having what the white man&rsquo;s got (when they just take). Really, the author of this is so naive it&rsquo;s  pitiful. I wonder just how well he mixes with the  poor and  discriminated against &#8216;other&rsquo; himself.    </p>

		<p>Asians have no respect for anything in the sea. They see nothing wrong with the cruel practice of shark finning, whereby the fins of over 70 milliion sharks every year are cut off and the live animals are thrown back into the sea to die, just so they can enjoy a bowl of shark-fin soup. I don&rsquo;t want them anywhere near water.

<p>Blacks are the same way if given the chance. I am sure blacks do not follow any White man&rsquo;s rule in fishing than they do any of our laws. I no more want blacks fishing than I want Asians fishing.</p>

		<p>It looks like fishing along with hunting, camping, tennis, golfing, skiing, going to the opera, and even to the library need to be investigated for lack of diversity. When they are found guilty as charged a new federal government CZAR of DIVERSITY for Leisure Activities should be created. This will make them inclusive and look more like America.  </p>

		<p>IF they want to see blacks and &#8220;asians&#8221; fishing they should come to the Southern U.S.</p>
<p>Laotians love to fish and hunt as well.  Blacks love it too.</p>
<p>Of course I realize that in the UK &#8220;Asian&#8221; takes on a different meaning.</p>

		<p>There are lot of Black fishermen in the southern U. S. It may just have to do with the likelihood of having grown up in a rural environment.</p>
<p>  Yes, this is quite true. It is not uncommon in the South to find blacks fishing in very remote rural locations. I guess this must be a regional difference because you don&rsquo;t find it among the Northern blacks. <br>

		<p>I encourage everyone to re-read poster #3&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>He is so right, so right, so right.</p>
<p>I think about this sometimes whenever I hear yet of another scheme to try and get more &#8216;minorities&rsquo; to do this or that activity that lots of whites do, (think swimming, hiking, biking, camping, reading, pet owning, aquarium hobby, model trains, boy scouts and on and on&hellip;)</p>
<p>These liberals just have nothing better to do than to force non-whites to do things they have little interest in using taxpayer money paid by whites so that white people in every niche can experience the &#8216;joys of diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Look - I have no interest in bongo drums, african dance, latino fiestas or rugby, water polo or many such things for that matter.  If someone came to me and said you have to go try those things and we&rsquo;ll pay for you to do it and cheerlead you all the way, I would be like, huh?  </p>
<p>Hobbies and other activities are from choice and interest.  You can&rsquo;t say the blacks and asians didn&rsquo;t have fathers who fished so we have to step in and be their surrogate fathers so they can darn well fish!  It&rsquo;s white liberals who do all this foolishness.</p>
<p>Folks, the PC has got to stop sometime!</p>

		<p>Tim in Indiana hit the nail on the head: this is white paternalism at it&rsquo;s worst.  Just because WHITE people decided that fishing is a good thing, doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone else does.  Maybe black people don&rsquo;t go fishing because they don&rsquo;t want to.  I mean, they still have free will with regard to their own leisure time, right?  Personally, I enjoy fishing from time to time, but I could see how some people might dislike it.  You have to sit or stand still for hours, you get up at dawn, you might not catch anything, and, when you finally do, you have to kill and gut a fish.  If someone does not want to engage in this, then I support them 100%.  It seems REASONABLE to not want to go fishing.  </p>
<p>As a woman I just gotta ask: fishing is certainly sexist too right?  I mean the ratio of men to women fishing must be about 10 to 1.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Asians have no respect for anything in the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the UK, &#8220;Asians&#8221; usually means people from the Indian subcontinent because that&rsquo;s where most of our immigrants are from. In a negative context, it is even more likely to be restricted to people from Pakistan since Sikhs and Hindus integrate better.</p>
<p>The article is certainly not about immigrants from China. They don&rsquo;t whine or live off welfare so nobody really cares whether they go fishing or not.</p>

		<p>My (Japanese) wife loves fishing!  While I&rsquo;m no big fan of freshwater fish, Sayaka is why we have a fly rod &amp; reel, and why I began to tie fishing flies again for the first time since high school.  I like saltwater work with live bait, well offshore, but she&rsquo;s happy at a lake or stream.</p>
<p>If an unwanted group of invaders prefers gang-rape and robbery-stabbings to fishing, this is a matter for firearms owners and the courts to handle.</p>
