			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Voxy News (Wellington, New Zealand), September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Public Health Association conference has been told that ethnicity is a powerful predictor of a person&rsquo;s health, because of a racist &#8220;system of structuring opportunity and assigning value based on the social interpretation of how one looks (which is what we call &#8220;race&#8221;).</p>
<p>Dr Camara Jones  &mdash;  who is Adjunct Professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University and at the Morehouse School of Medicine, both in Atlanta, Georgia  &mdash;  described research to the delegates gathered at Turangawaewae Marae that compared self identified &#8220;race&#8221;/ethnicity and responses to the question &#8220;How do other people usually classify you in this country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research into socially-assigned and self-assigned race/ethnicity found that excellent or very good self-rated health is associated with the &#8216;on the street&rsquo; race that others assign you. Being socially assigned as &#8216;White&rsquo; in the United States is linked to advantages in health status, even for those who identify with a non-White group.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says racism unfairly disadvantages some individuals and communities, unfairly advantages other individuals and communities and saps the strength of the whole society through the waste of human resources.</p>
<p>Dr Jones, who spent time in New Zealand in 1999 examining Ministry of Health programmes to try to narrow the disparity between the health of Maori and Pakeha, told delegates that health inequality between ethnic groups can be seen through the lens, not only of non-White disadvantage but also through White advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;These advantages may include the benefit of the doubt, high expectations, trust, laxity in enforcing the same rules with which non-White people must strictly comply, the sense of entitlement and the day-to-day breaks which White people often experience as &#8216;luck&rsquo; or never even notice. Instead of &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; being invisible or neutral or normal, we can talk about it as being an asset in a race conscious society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Jones says that achieving health equity requires valuing all individuals and populations equally, recognising and rectifying historical injustices, and providing resources according to need.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnership in decision-making and self-determination  &mdash;  the power to decide, the power to act and the control of resources  &mdash;  are vital to achieving equity in health.&#8221;<br>

<p>* It is these kinds of liberals who are so far out in their ideology that you cannot reason with them.  They actually believe that every problem a non-white person has is caused by &#8216;racism.&rsquo;  It&rsquo;s like a boogeyman - everywhere but without a specific identity.</p>
<p>Conversely, they believe that whites are a monolith.  Everyone&rsquo;s happy.  Everyone&rsquo;s rich.  What about the poor among whites?  Why don&rsquo;t wealthy or middle class blacks stay in black neighborhoods to &#8216;lend a hand?&rsquo;  Why do latinos discriminate against each other?  What about blacks doing racism against asians?</p>
<p>Why do the poor in EVERY country seem to never go anywhere?  It&rsquo;s not &#8216;racism&rsquo; but cultural and familial values that are passed on from generation to generation that determine your horizons.  These factors influence class level, and not some mean white dude you never met mysteriously trying to hold you down.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Doctor&#8221; Jones, please explain to us how the good health and longevity of the people of most European and east Asian societies and nations, as compared with the rampart poor health, bad personal habits, lack of sanitation and relative short life spans of the third world is somehow due to &#8220;socially-assigned and self-assigned race/ethnicity?&#8221;  What gobbledy-gook passing for science!</p>

		<p>Poor health plagues more blacks, especially after 30 or so, than whites or Asians. Racism? No. Stupidity, lack of focus on anything except immediate gratification. Constant unprotected sex, drug use, alcohol abuse and eating a ridiculous junk and soul food diet will kill you everytime. Michelle Obama spends her time on &#8220;healthy&#8221; diets for Americans not because she&rsquo;s worried about European Americans or Chinese Americans. I don&rsquo;t admire her, but she is not stupid, unlike a high percent of her co-descendents from Africa. However reason is the last thing most blacks use, have, or understand. Too bad we white taxpayers and health care ratepayers have to pay for their lousy habits and health. They don&rsquo;t pay their way in taxes, and they contribute little or nothing to the health care system they overuse.</p>

		<p> What a laughable bunch of hooey! This Dr. Camara Jones (gee, wonder what color SHE is?) spouts all the usual high-sounding, meaningless shibboleths about &#8220;unfairness,&#8221; &#8220;inequality,&#8221; &#8220;White privilege,&#8221; yadda, yadda, yadda, as most liberals do when trying to explain away the multiple problems blacks (mostly) bring on themselves. The longer she talks, the less sense she makes.</p>
<p> Let me suggest an alternative explanation. First, Whites tend to have better health in this country because, overall, we tend to have healthier lifestyles   &mdash;   less smoking, less drinking, less drug abuse, etc. Second, we tend to have better health because the U.S. climate, in general, is more similar to that of the part of the earth our ancesters came from   &mdash;   Europe   &mdash;   than it is to the part of the earth that blacks&rsquo; ancesters came from   &mdash;   Africa. Genetics have prepared us to thrive more fully in temperate climates. They have prepared blacks to do better in a hot, rain-forest type climate.</p>
<p> You see, Dr. Jones? It&rsquo;s really not rocket science, now is it? Although it&rsquo;s definitely politically incorrect to say so! </p>

		<p>Before I even clicked the link I just knew they were going to trot out the tired old &#8220;white privilege&#8221; canard. And they still managed to use &#8220;pakeha&#8221; which, for those who don&rsquo;t know, is a maori racial slur against whites.</p>

		<p>Nobody talks about body language and how it affects interactions.  90+% of the way we communicate is through body language.  White people usually have sanguine dispositions.  Compare this with East Asians who usually are stiff and distant and sometimes put on phony white/ black/ Latino persona&rsquo;s.  Black Africans are usually lazy, loud and/or angry.</p>

		<p>This has got to be the most rambling, unintelligible, ridiculous and nonsensical article of the year. I had to read the original article twice to make sure that I wasn&rsquo;t having a stroke and had lost my intellectual capacities. Health equity??!!  What the #%!^*! is THAT supposed to be? These types of leftists are beyond help. Their hatred for Whites and their successful life styles has driven them completely mad!</p>

		<p>Whiteness IS an asset in a race-conscious society. But not for long if these over-educated idiots get their way.</p>
<p>Good health outcomes simply aren&rsquo;t that complicated. I mentioned my &#8220;vibrant&#8221; neighborhood in another thread. There are two farmers markets within a mile of my house. Looking at the people, buying and selling, you&rsquo;d swear that the neighborhoods had turned all-white again. Except then you look down the street and see the &#8220;youth&#8221; hanging out in front of the convenience store. Take a wide-angle picture and maybe even Professor Jones might understand.<br>

		<p>@ Old Raleigh Native: &#8220;I had to read the original article twice to make sure that I wasn&rsquo;t having a stroke and had lost my intellectual capacities.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t often spontaneously laugh out loud but that comment was damn funny! I also found myself re-reading some of the things this Dr. Jones said to figure out what she was saying, and for the most part couldn&rsquo;t; it was all the usual high-sounding nonsense that really amounts to nothing.</p>

I do a great deal of walking. I don&rsquo;t smoke. I drink red wine when I attend the rare social gathering but sometimes beer. Over the last two years, I have lost over 50 lbs on an Atkins-like meal plan of my own design. I long ago gave up coffee for unsweetened green tea (which I drink in enormous quantities).</p>
<p>I work at being healthy every day and it&rsquo;s a pain in the neck. When I was younger, I dreamed of eating double-cheese, double-pepperoni pizza every night for dinner. Now that I&rsquo;m an adult, I have to restrict everything I eat.</p>
<p>Why do I put myself through such restrictions? Because I want to be healthy as I get older. I&rsquo;m not chasing eternal youth but I am trying to avoid all the health pitfalls I have seen other family members experience as they grew older.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t change the genetic risk factors but I can change bad habits to good habits.</p>

<p>Well, this is it in a nutshell. Understanding that the problem exists in the first place IS the first step involved in solving the problem. Understanding the true nature of the problem is the second step. In this case, the good doctor does not understand the true nature of the problem. </p>
<p>They smoke, they drink, they use drugs, they use violence against one another, they eat a diet not commensurate with their metabolism, etc.  </p>

		<p>In health care there are; 1) genetically endowed advantages, 2) personal behaviors and 3) socially bestowed benefits.  The article identifies none of these and posits that the difference in &#8220;self rated health&#8221; is due to racism inferring #3, the negative socially bestowed benefits due to &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  Working at an urban hospital I find this strange as there are a tidal wave of immigrants using the facilities free-of-charge.  Further there is a growing realization of how important personal choices are to ones well-being.  So much so there is a new term that has been coined &#8220;lifestyle diseases&#8221;.  Eating and drinking poorly are primary issues, as is not getting enough exercise (as in the simple act of a daily walk).  It is oft said in our hospital, the greatest hazard to one&rsquo;s health is stupidity.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it wasn&rsquo;t true.  And I&rsquo;m not asking for any forgiveness if it is.  More medicines for white-specific disease than black/asian/hispanic?  Too bad.  If the population is larger (and getting older, unfortunately), the money will chase the profit margin.</p>
<p>More and more competent health care for whites than other races?  Also too bad.  We are still a majority and whites pay into health care for ALL ethnicities at enormous rates relative to their own use of the system.  Why not give us some perks for our participation?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Doctor Jones-</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/35v9mvs</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t accurate.</p>
<p>But what if she&rsquo;s still wrong?</p>
<p>You can reduce every person&rsquo;s needs and consequent resource use to calories as baseline energy units.  That includes the car you drive, the food you eat, the electricity you use to light a lightbulb.  Do the numbers for the U.S. and you will see we-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
With only 4.6% of the world&rsquo;s population, the United States consumes a full 25% of the world&rsquo;s energy and emits more carbon dioxide than any other country.  The United States consumes about 18 million barrels of oil each day.  The United States consumes over 1800 cubic meters of water annually per capita, about three times the world average.  The United States consumes more water than any other country.  The United States consumes about 17 million barrels of oil per day, of which nearly two-thirds is used for transportation.  The United States consumes timber at a rate nearly double the average for developed countries.  Though its population does not exceed 6 per cent of the world total, the United States consumes almost three-quarters of the available supply of rubber and gasoline, two-thirds of all the raw silk, and one-quarter of the sugar. The United States consumes 33 times as much energy per person as India, 13 times as much as China, two and a half times as much as Japan, and two times as much as Sweden.  The United States consumes 30 percent of the world&rsquo;s paper.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3xvls95" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3xvls95</a></p>
<p>What If.  Rather than an evil excess, those numbers simply reflect the minimum necessary amount to sustain our &#8216;racial happiness&rsquo; factor as a function of internal self confidence, lifestyle satisfaction and thus social involvement as active health?  Furthermore, what if, when you compare to countries like China-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The US consumes 25% of the world&rsquo;s energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.5%. The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (20% of the world population) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6 kW per person.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, electricity consumption per capita in the U.S. has decreased about 1% per year between 2004 and 2008. Power consumption is projected to hit 4,333,631 million kilowatt hours by 2013, an annual growth rate of 1.93% for the next five years. Consumption increased from 3,715,949 in 2004 to an expected 3,937,879 million kilowatt hours per year in 2008, an increase of about 1.5% per year. The rate of increase has been steadily decreasing - it was 2.5% in the 1990s.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/27wroo" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/27wroo</a></p>
<p>The change in economics of consumption reflect a change in the benefits of -access-?  Again, because money chases those who will spend it.</p>
<p>I think there is substantial evidence to prove the postulate that homogenous social insularism, i.e. &#8216;racism&rsquo;, is nothing more than a Darwinian tool to control environmental resources sufficient to thrive.</p>
<p>And thus, any &#8216;guilt&rsquo; for race specific access to resources, implicit or accused, from one race to another, is nothing less than a predatory attempt to compete with success by clamoring at the costs of inadequacy.  Like the Cuckoo bird laying it&rsquo;s eggs in another&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>The difference is, we are no longer cosseting blacks or hispanics in a vacuum.  We are _competing_ (and losing) against Chinese and European powers whose capabilities, at a racial genetics as well as social level may well match or exceed our own.</p>
<p>The fact is that Darwin teaches us that evolution selectively chooses those best adapted to living in a given environment.  And the one thing that the populations of areas like lower Asia and Africa have proven they are &#8216;best at&rsquo; is breeding entirely out of homeostatic symbiosis with their environment.  Social or natural.</p>
<p>If you want a sad story, wait until those lower IQ, genetically predisposed suicide population groups _die off_.  And we move on.</p>
<p>If you want to see a real economic an environmental disaster in the making, try giving every one of them a U.S. style lifestyle at 11KW a year in electricity alone.</p>
<p>We are past the tipping point where we can save the world population of humanity by making them &#8216;just like us&rsquo; in privileges.  And where the ROW has been foolishly invited into our society while sustaining their bad habits of LMI and high breeding rates/short generational cycles; then we _must_ treat the symptom as the rest of the disease: by active denial.  Lest the Cuckoo become an eagle and kill us all.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones is living proof of the strategy the other side will use to demand more of because they are, collectively, less.  Put one smart person in a position of power and use her as a symbol of &#8216;all that is wrong&rsquo; with THEIR vision.  Not the world&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And the irony here is that the vision she proselytizes is one of affinity with her own group (racism) rather than one of socialist &#8216;equity&rsquo; (investment in = value out) survival of all of us.</p>
<p>Wake up America.  Sometimes pity is just fraud under new management.</p>

		<p>Scandinavians invented the Sauna and have been health conscious since early times, even pre-history.  Similarly, Europeans used natural hot springs for water assisted healing, which turned out to be scientifically supported, especially since hot springs always have sulfur content.  So it is a matter of culture, and since it has been part of European consciousness, even genetic to tend towards healthy life stles.</p>
