<h1><a href="https://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100912/NEWS/9120326">Jurors Must Reveal Race and Ethnicity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Yakin, Times Herald-Record (Middletown, New York), September 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Starting Monday, everyone who shows up for jury duty in New York will be handed a questionnaire that asks for their race and ethnic background.</p>
<p>{snip} The requirement was created by Judiciary Law Section 528, newly minted on June 25 by Gov. David Paterson&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>In guidance sent out by the state Office of Court Administration, jury commissioners are instructed to hand out the information cards to jurors. They can say that the state requires them to collect the data, and the law is printed on the back of the card. They can advise jurors to use black or blue ink.</p>
<p>They are told not to say anything else about that card or why it&rsquo;s being distributed and not to offer any opinions on why the data is being collected or how to answer the questions (other than truthfully). They&rsquo;re told not to offer the jurors a chance to ask questions  &mdash;  and if they ask anyway, have them come to the front of the room to ask in private.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state Legislature passed the bill this spring in part because of a 2006 Citizen Action-New York study that suggested that minorities are significantly underrepresented in civil jury pools. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The questions on the new juror cards are pretty innocuous. Four of the seven are for demographic purposes; they ask if the juror is male or female; year of birth; if they&rsquo;re of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, with different boxes for different countries of origin; and race, with 15 options including &#8220;other&#8221; with a space for write-ins.</p>
<p>And yes, jurors are required to fill out the cards.<br>

		<p>I fully support this initiative. Next time I&rsquo;m notified for jury duty I&rsquo;m going to claim my race as black African.  Under the one-drop rule who can say otherwise?</p>
<p>Who knows, with luck I may be able to send a clearly guilty fellow bro to the slam.</p>

<p>Are they embarrassed or trying to hide this from the public?</p>
<p>Just another attempt to keep minorities out of the &#8216;prison-industrial complex&rsquo; and get them back into their neighborhoods where they can again terrorize their communities with crime and violence.<br>

		<p>You will never see a White defendant sue over this blatantly unconstitutional move.  Whites can&rsquo;t be judged by blacks, because black can never comprise a jury of our peers. But Whites are so weak that they no longer can tell the difference.</p>

		<p>If I lived in New York and was called for jury duty, I might refuse to fill out the card.  Let them arrest me for refusing to divulge my race/ethnicity.  If there is a time for civil disobedience, it is now.</p>

		<p>When one of the most racially/ethnically diverse states in the union asks you your race for jury duty (when it&rsquo;s illegal to do so on job app.s) for the implied purpose of protecting &#8220;minority rights&#8221;, you&rsquo;d best be suspicious of your so called &#8220;legal&#8221; system. The judiciary is the tip of the spear of tyranny in America. </p>

		<p>The unelected courts up to the Supremes have injected race into jury selection and overturned convictions of clearly guilty parties because of non-representative, so-called, juries.</p>
<p>The Courts have caused most of our PC, let alone crime, problems, along with executive branch officials who don&rsquo;t enforce laws passed by alleged representatives of the people.</p>
<p>Thus it is time for a new Constitution. Juries, along with the 14 Amendment and several other so-called amendments,  are a relic of the past. Nationalist Judges, not juries, are needed, with new powers from a new Constitution not designed for &#8220;all&#8221; the people, who protect the European origin community, and who would suppress cultural subversives, pornographers and their allies in  corporate media including Internet of today, illegal aliens and those who would turn America into Africa. &#8220;One man one vote&rsquo;, found nowhere in the original constitution, but created by the Supreme Court, needs to go along with the now ridiculous  First, Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments which have been stretched beyond reason by out of control judges. The core of a new constitution should be ethnic integrity and what now is the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard Newt Gingrich, Hannity, Beck, Limbaugh or the GOP leaders in Congress, let alone the newly educated fecund Palin, tackle these hard but obvious questions. It would take an intellectual depth and knowledge of European and classical history that none of them possess.</p>

<p>Well, they probably are not properly represented. They do not vote, they do not register to vote, they move around all the time, they just fail to show up for jury duty, they give a bogus answer as to why they cannot appear for jury duty, they just cannot even read a jury summons and throw the piece of paper away, etc.</p>
<p>NOTHING hard to understand here.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re told not to offer the jurors a chance to ask questions &mdash; and if they ask anyway, have them come to the front of the room to ask in private&#8221;</p>
<p>And if the juror does ask the question, have the juror WHISPER very quietly so no one else can hear. We would not want someone to hear something. That would be BAD!</p>

		<p>Apart from the obvious fact that this is a flagrant attempt to get more blacks sitting in judgment on Whites, the whole thing seems to be of very dubious legality.  I&rsquo;m no lawyer, but it seems to me that any employer who asked potential hires their sex, race and national origin would get sued pretty quick.</p>
<p>Of course, since this is yet another black &#8220;empowerment&#8221; scheme, I don&rsquo;t expect any legal challenges.<br>

		<p>Ah, who needs a jury of peers, we need a jury of racial quota&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Of course, a black criminal will need a jury of entirely blacks, but we will all know, a white criminal needs to be judged by a &#8220;diverse&#8221; jury.</p>

		<p>Of course they want more non-Whites. The jury nullification rate must have dropped off.<br>
Whites should refuse to serve on criminal juries.  They can&rsquo;t arrest all of us!</p>

		<p>I, and other bikers, have found that if you show up for jury selection wearing a Harley Davidson head bandanna and a Harley T shirt, the chances of you being picked are very small, also wearing one that says &#8220;Hang em all&#8221; works too, seen that one myself!</p>
