			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Clark, Daily Mail (London), September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Teachers are being forced to report children as young as three to the authorities for using alleged &#8216;racist&rsquo; language, it was claimed last night.</p>
<p>Munira Mirza, a senior advisor to London Mayor Boris Johnson, said schools were being made to spy on nursery age youngsters by the Race Relations Act 2000.</p>
<p>More than a quarter of a million children have been accused of racism since it became law, she said.</p>
<p>Writing in Prospect magazine, she said: &#8216;The more we seek to measure racism, the more it seems to grow.</p>
<p>&#8216;Teachers are now required to report incidents of racist abuse among children as young as three to local authorities, resulting in a massive increase of cases and reinforcing the perception that we need an army of experts to manage race relations from cradle to grave.</p>
<p>&#8216;Does this heightened awareness of racism help to stamp it out? Quite the opposite. It creates a climate of suspicion and anxiety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Act compelled 43,000 public authorities, including schools and churches, &#8216;to promote good relations between persons of different racial groups&rsquo;. Details of the incidents are logged on databases.</p>
<p>Teachers are allowed to report racism even if the alleged &#8216;victim&rsquo; was not offended or if the child does not understand what they were saying.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information replies obtained by civil liberties group the Manifesto Club show that between 2002 and 2009, 280,000 incidents have been reported.<br>

		<p>The only thing that has prevented this type of looney-bin activity over here is that everyone, whites, Asians, latinos - almost all their kids assimilate into black hip hop culture by osmosis, or they are made to feel that it is normal.</p>
<p>I swear, you can&rsquo;t turn on a kids TV show without getting some hip hop music intro or rap singing activity - even the shows for the young (it&rsquo;s in all the schools now as a part of the curriculum too).  </p>
<p>So liberals bypass parents and the traditional culture altogether and program young white girls to &#8216;get jiggy wit it&rsquo; and want a black man, and they program young white males into being metrosexual jason beiber types with sensitivy and big hair!</p>

		<p>I would just love to know how many of these accusations are aimed at white children. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit if they ALL were. </p>
<p><br>
So, what happens after these teachers &#8220;report&#8221; this racism to authorities? Arrest and throw them into kiddie prison? Arrest their parents? Like someone said last night.. Bririan has lost it&rsquo;s mind and gone completely mad.</p>

		<p>These people are seeing something that is not there but exists only in their minds.</p>
<p>They too WANT TO SEE THE RACISM. Whatever racism is.</p>
<p>They want to see it and are seeing it, even if it is not even there. Poor deluded demented people.</p>

		<p>Toddlers being accused of racism.   Now, you see the paranoia of black Africans on full display and how their mindset of looking out for &#8220;racism&#8221; in order to shift responsibility of their failures onto others has affected everyone.  All non-white groups have adopted black Africans&rsquo; language of resentment and irresponsibility to some degree.  To them white people are the source of all evil and no good so don&rsquo;t hold them responsible for anything or they will throw up slavery, Hiroshima, colonialism, Hitler etc.  Don&rsquo;t remind them that white innovations in health care allowed for the explosion in non-white populations from the time of European colonialism to the present or you&rsquo;ll be called racist.  Don&rsquo;t remind them that Caucasian innovations are the foundations of their modern societies or you&rsquo;ll be called racist.</p>

		<p>This really reflects poorly on the teachers. They seem to be willing participants themselves, at least for the most part. Since they don&rsquo;t hire themselves the bureaucracy in charge of interviewing and hiring teachers probably screens them for docility and the proper PC outlook. They must feel pretty secure since they keep raising the ante, bit by bit.   </p>

		<p>Could it be that recognizing differences is a normal human trait?  Could it be that people are naturally racist?  Could it be that racism, as defined as recognizing the differences in diversity, is not an evil?  Just asking.</p>

		<p>This is funny, because for non-whites, and blacks especially, being racist (race conscious) is the most important aspect of their being, seems like. Maybe if the authorities crack the proverbial whip down on whites, whites wont even notice the obscene behavior of non-whites&hellip; so in response to real reality the authorities are cracking down on phantom white racism&hellip; ? You couldn&rsquo;t even make this stuff up on the Twilight Zone TV show.    </p>

		<p>I hope the majority of teachers do what any normal person would&hellip;just smile and say, &#8220;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard any racism in my classroom at all.&#8221; (Of course, that only works until the kids are old enough to be &#8220;concerned citizens&#8221; and report you to The Authorities.</p>

		<p>#1 - I&rsquo;m sad to say I&rsquo;ve seen it too. Even kids that go to public schools that are 90% white are wearing sagging pants, listening to rap, and drooling over whichever black athlete or &#8220;singer&#8221; has made the most hateful anti-white statement in the past 15 minutes. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the Obama worship.</p>
<p>On the plus side, white kids who have been homeschooled or attended quality private schools seem to have their heads screwed on straight.</p>

		<p>My instincts tell me this is part of a two part scheme. Step 1 is to accuse toddlers and their families of racism as a pretext. Step 2 is to indoctrinate those toddlers with their own racial marxist ideologies. I suspect that those pushing this would ultimately threaten the parents with fines or charge the parents with abuse if they didn&rsquo;t go along with it. They really are setting up a Big Brother style bureaucracy.</p>

		<p>Blacks are against racism, yet the only accuse those with light skin and light hair of being racist.  Isn&rsquo;t that like someone accusing all black men of being voilent?  I betcha the kids tested in this study were only white. Do you think they would a &#8216;racism&rsquo; study in Africa or China or Mexico?  What a waste of the taxpayers&rsquo; money and people like Munira Mirza need to get real jobs.</p>

<p>Maybe they should seek to discover anti-white racism? Perhaps that is all they should seek to uncover. Call it &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;. A good 60 year affirmative action plan ought to do just the trick. What? We have to over compensate and extend it even further and to a more extreme extent in order to make up for &#8216;past injustice&rsquo;? Ok then&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mayor&rsquo;s advisor: &ldquo;The more we seek to measure racism, the more it seems to grow.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And the more diversity proves to be an abject failure the more intense you try to invoke the perverted ideology.</p>
<p>It will take war to make these mind conditioned robots understand their view of a multicultural utopia is the work of stupid, out-of-touch fools, who are so gullible and naive they would condone concentration camps and crematories if the idea were promoted to them as diversity has been.</p>
<p>Unless fools like these are identified and disallowed beforehand, any new nation that includes them will suffer the same fate as this failed empire.</p>
<p>Whether they think as they do, because they&rsquo;re self hatng whites, or because they&rsquo;re no more than fools who can be easily duped, their inclusion into white society will make it forever too weak to exist for any length of time.</p>

		<p>England is run by the same handlers that we have here in the USA. The same with all European countries. This will be coming to America soon (if it isn&rsquo;t already) and the English have caved in just a little faster than we have. But it is coming to ALL White nations. Soon they will be taking the White kids away from their parents for teaching &#8220;hate&#8221;, &#8220;racism&#8221; and then ban any White male and female to dare have a White child. Can&rsquo;t anyone else see what is truly going on here?  Get rid of Whitey is the name of the game and always has been.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, there&rsquo;s something deep in our DNA that dearly loves a witch hunt followed by a good witch burning. Since we don&rsquo;t believe in witchcraft anymore, we&rsquo;re forced to accuse people of something else.  What, after all, is heinous about being a racist?  What does the word even mean?  Doesn&rsquo;t matter. Just shut up &amp; go collect some wood&hellip;</p>

		<p>This kind of thinking has brought on the right-wing backlashes that are sweeping Europe and the U.S.  American leftist pundits are sputtering and flailing their arms over the Tea Party movement, flabbergasted that politicians will state that they&rsquo;re against the Ground Zero mosque or amused by admittedly &#8220;objectionable&#8221; joke photos of the first couple as pimp and prostitute.  Only small numbers of blacks have joined the movement, so of course it must be racist  &mdash;  just like the ballet or classical music concerts, I guess.</p>

		<p>Remember when we were kids, and were taught that in Communist countries, children were encouraged to &#8216;tell&rsquo; on their parents?   And remember later, reading about the Inquisition, when children were tricked or coerced into revealing that their parents were still &#8216;secret Judaizers&rsquo;?</p>
<p>In both cases, the result of the information gleaned from the little ones was that the parents ended up dispossessed, imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.</p>
<p>This is merely a more more subtle, more systemic, version of that tactic of getting children to &#8216;tell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You can bet that the root motivation for the reporting of &#8216;racist&rsquo; toddlers is the desire, on someone&rsquo;s part, to put the parents&rsquo; names on a list.</p>
<p>And as we know from the Nazi Holocaust: FIRST, YOU MAKE A LIST.</p>

		<p>The authors of the RRA 2000 no doubt had unemployed Stasi agents from the old East Germany as consultants. The Stasi went so far as to store the body odours of citizens in its infamous archives. What is next for the former democracy of (formerly) Great Britain? </p>
