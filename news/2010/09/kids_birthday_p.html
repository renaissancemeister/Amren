			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Baker, Enquirer (Cincinnati), September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A large, beer-soaked melee broke out at a toddler&rsquo;s birthday party early Tuesday in this small Hamilton County suburb, hospitalizing two men and prompting police from several agencies to respond.</p>
<p> &#8220;It was an unbelievable scene, the amount of blood and broken glass,&#8221; said Elmwood Place Police Chief William Peskin.</p>
<p>About 30 children witnessed the 1 a.m. brawl among 75 people at Elmwood Eagles Hall, 5633 Vine St.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Punches and beer bottles were thrown after a dispute that began earlier Monday among two men  &mdash;  a woman&rsquo;s boyfriend and her ex-husband  &mdash;  came to a head at the birthday party for a 3-year-old.</p>
<p>When police arrived, some 150 people were still gathered and about half of them were participating in the melee, Peskin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 20 police officers from jurisdictions such as Cincinnati and St. Bernard swarmed the scene to restore order.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A total of 15 people were injured, including five who went to University Hospital, Peskin said. Four people were treated for cuts that required stitches and then released. One man underwent eye surgery from a stab wound from a broken beer bottle, the chief said. Doctors are doing tests to check for possible brain damage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole party was Hispanic, so we&rsquo;re having language barriers and they are being very uncooperative,&#8221; Peskin said.</p>

		<p>What on earth were 30 kids doing up at 1am at a beer bash? It seems like minorities need nothing more than a kid&rsquo;s birthday to all get drunk, more than likely the kids were an annoyance to the real party going on. </p>

		<p>Of course. If they aren&rsquo;t Blacks they are Mexicans. It happens all the time where I live. Any excuse for a stabbing, gunfire, brawls where Mexicans congregate. Super Bowl is also another good reason for their lack of civility and drunkeness.</p>

		<p>My hometown, nice.</p>
<p>Absent from the local news coverage is why a 3-year old&rsquo;s birthday party required a hall rental and why there were 30 (!) kids there on a school night. Party on, Paco!</p>
<p>These are supposed to be our hard-working, family-oriented immigrants? Well, maybe family-oriented if bringing kids to a bar brawl counts.</p>
<p>Cincinnati doesn&rsquo;t have a big mexican population (yet) but the location of this hall is right next to the Carthage neighborhood which is probably the most heavily mexican/central american neighborhood in the whole metro area.</p>
<p>Will the Elmwood police do the right thing and send these thugs and their families straight to ICE? I&rsquo;m not optimistic.</p>

		<p>Had they been black instead of hispanic there would probably been shots fired and fatalities, probably would have been some wounded toddlers. I&rsquo;ll take brown over black anyday.</p>

		<p>I like Mexican food though.  I would have used the fight as a distraction to grab a plate full of tacos to go.  And yes, I probably would have snagged a beer.  But seriously, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been there.</p>

		<p>This is pretty typical. My brother was a deputy in central Florida and has told me many stories of things hes seen. One comes to mind here. He was sent to a disturbance at a residence and upon arrival saw a Mexican working on a car in the front yard, entering the house there were several people including children in the living room watching tv and 1 man cooking in the kitchen, when he walked down the hall toward the bedrooms he found a man with a stab wound to his chest bleeding out and unconscious. No one in the home called for help and on my brothers arrival told him there had been no disturbance. They were happy to let him die even with children present. The only reason police became involved was a white neighbor heard the commotion and called it in.</p>

		<p>Ho-Hum.</p>
<p>As a S. Californian, I knew from the headline, instantly, that this brawl was perpetuated by mexicans.</p>
<p>Welcome to our world you guys in the mid-west.</p>
<p>This is an every-Monday story in S. California and has been for decades now  &mdash;  stabbings at kiddie parties, quinces (a coming-out party for 15-year old girls), baby showers, weddings and even funerals.</p>
<p>These people hold grudges that go back generations and seek vengeance for imagined slights that may or may not have happened years ago.</p>
<p>The police tell us in the schools that that&rsquo;s why gang intervention doesn&rsquo;t work with these people  &mdash;  they are compelled to avenge family members no matter how long ago or how ridiculous the slight.   </p>
<p>The commotion starts after hours of drinking, smoking blunts and snorting vidrio and THAT combined with low IQs and little/no self-control, it is no wonder it often takes reinforcements from three or four police departments to break up the mess  &mdash;  and there is a good chance that the violence will be directed against la policia once they show up.</p>
<p>The next day, as sure as the sun comes up, these same hung-over jerks will claim all of their injuries were caused by police brutality  &mdash;  backed up by their many race-based organizations and activists demanding huge settlements.</p>
<p>And Spartan asks this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What on earth were 30 kids doing up at 1am at a beer bash?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The kids were certainly not in the way as this is very common in this community, parties on school nights that last until sunrise.  These people are not &#8216;just like us&rsquo; as the media and academia continue to scream  &mdash;  they are not like us at all.</p>
<p>Now are you beginning to understand why approximately 60% of hispanic children drop out of school?  Education is of no import to them.</p>
<p>Yet when they fail repeatedly, they&rsquo;ll claim the schools are White-centric, institutionally racist, they don&rsquo;t see anyone in the textbooks that &#8216;look like them&rsquo; and any other manner of stupid excuse to cover up their poor attendance, apathy, laziness and disinterest in school.</p>
<p>This is gleefully reported and disseminated by the media with calls for zillions  more dollars to be targeted at (sigh) gang intervention programs, head start-type programs, health care programs, food and housing programs and more hiring of teachers &#8216;of color.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so it goes, the insanity, around and around on an endless Möbius strip.</p>
<p>Yet, I, as a teacher, am constantly blamed for their failures and I, as a taxpayer, am constantly hit up for more money to shovel into an endless pit to support them and I as a White person am constantly blamed for oppressing them and keeping them from their &#8216;fair share of the American Pie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Does anyone really believe political hacks such as Nutmeg Whitless or Moonbeam Brown will &#8216;solve the fiscal crises&rsquo; in California while the border remains wide open?</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>The TV news showed the little girl&rsquo;s pink birthday cake still inside the party hall/crime scene - it hadn&rsquo;t even been cut yet as of the 1am brawl.  It was also splattered with blood.  Way to go, &#8220;parents&#8221;!</p>
