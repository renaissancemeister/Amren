<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When it comes to fighting antibiotics, E. coli bacteria have each other&rsquo;s backs.</p>
<p>Just a few drug-resistant bacteria can release a protective substance that makes a whole population resilient to drugs, a new study in the Sept. 2 Nature shows. The findings may lead to new ways of combating drug-resistant germs in humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antibiotic resistance is a global health issue and we want to understand how and why bacteria become resistant to a particular antibiotic,&#8221; says biophysicist Hyun Youk of MIT.</p>
<p>It turns out that when E. coli, a common gut microbe that occasionally causes illness, becomes resistant to an antibiotic, it releases a molecule called indole to share with its more vulnerable neighbors. Indole is a molecule known to help E. coli tolerate stress. By sharing the compound, just a few members of the population can make the whole group of bacteria tolerant of an antibiotic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It turns out that the more resistant bacteria were producing indole. After further analysis, the team found that indole was turning on cellular pumps that push drugs out and was protecting against damage produced by chemically reactive free radicals.</p>
<p>When the researchers looked for genetic changes that might explain the indole production, they found numerous mutations that protected the bacteria against the antibiotic. There weren&rsquo;t any for increased indole production. It seemed that resistant bacteria, untroubled by the antibiotic, were able to keep right on producing their normal levels of indole, sharing it with neighbors. In contrast, bacteria that aren&rsquo;t drug resistant stop making indole in response to antibiotics.</p>
<p>But the indole production came at a cost to the resistant bacteria. Since they spent energy making the indole, they had fewer resources to use for their own growth and reproduction and grew more slowly than mutants that didn&rsquo;t produce indole. Somewhat similar to the evolutionary idea of kin selection, the process may ensure survival of the mutants&rsquo; relatives.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Even germs look out for their own kind&#8221;. </p>
<p>But not whites. Why are so many scientists conservative? What we need to do is find a way to introduce germs to liberals. Recreating in the germ, the manner in which a health organism attacks and incapacitates itself. Perhaps the secret lies in liberal-germ communication. Liberal arts education may turn out to be not so useless after all.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out that this article is essentially a lie.  Not in what it finds but in reporting that this is new information.</p>
<p>I first heard about this in high school and studied the phenomenon in some depth in my graduate level microbiology class&hellip;.over 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;antibiotic resistance&#8221; is not what it is portrayed to be.  Bacteria and other susceptible organisms do NOT normally become &#8220;antibiotic resistant&#8221;.  I mean, they do, when observed as individuals but NOT when observed as they exist in their biological niche (populations of humans).  What happens is, a bacteria might develop some way to thwart an antibiotic and may even spread that ability around.  However, it is quickly killed by the normal immune system before it can spread.  If it gets really lucky, it might spread to another person before it dies.  But the odds of this happening more than once, are slim.  That it would then spread out to infect many people&hellip;.that does not happen.</p>
<p>So why is this happening?  Simple&hellip;.AIDS.  An AIDS infected person not only uses antibiotics almost daily (and not actually because of the AIDS but because their behaviors, which they refuse to stop, make them susceptible to many diseases they should not be).  The bacteria aren&rsquo;t readily killed by the immune system&hellip;.and spread&hellip;..usually to other AIDS infected people&hellip;..through abnormal contact (like 300 sex partners a year).</p>
<p>Antibiotic use among the normal population is irrelevant.  In fact, populations that use far more antibiotics (but have few non-whites) have far less &#8220;antibiotic resistant&#8221; strains.  Race and behavior predict antibiotic resistance, NOT use of antibiotics.</p>
<p>For the last several decades, medical &#8220;research&#8221; has been devoted mostly to rationalizing politically correct nonsense, rather than legitimately figuring out what is up with disease and doing something about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see common knowledge from decades ago being presented as new knowledge.  Advances are being purposefully retarded to prevent these things from becoming obvious.  Anyone with a decent graduate level education related to medicine or biology will easily understand what I am talking about here.</p>
<p>Want a humorous experience&hellip;.try asking your doctor about what I just said and just watch the logical loop the loops he does to deny what should be straight forward science.  If your doctor is non-white, expect a blank stare&hellip;..and go find another (white) doctor.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of what the teacher said in Microbiology class. When you put a variety of bacteria in a petri dish eventually there will be only one kind of bacteria.     </p>

		<p>The altruism of these bacteria seems directed toward any microorganisms in their species, rather than to anything equivalent to members of their race in competition with other races.   </p>

		<p>To Anonymous (re Post # 3):</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason antibiotics don&rsquo;t work in a patient with HIV:</p>
<p>HIV is caused by a virus, NOT a bacteria strain. Antibiotics have no effect on the AIDS virus.</p>
