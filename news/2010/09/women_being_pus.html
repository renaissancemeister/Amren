<h1>Women Being Pushed to Their Deaths by Drug Dealers, Say Downtown Eastside Advocates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Fournier, The Province (Vancouver, BC), September 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ashley Machiskinic was a beautiful First Nations woman whose young life came crashing to the ground Sept. 15 in a sordid lane behind the Regent Hotel in Vancouver&rsquo;s Downtown Eastside.</p>
<p>Area residents and community leaders are convinced that Machiskinic, despite her off and on battles with drug addiction, did not take her own life.</p>
<p>They say Machiskinic, just 22, was the latest of several women to be killed or punished in a highly public way by drug dealers who want to send a message to women about what will happen to them if they don&rsquo;t pay off their drug debts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women get their heads shaved for a $30 drug debt, they&rsquo;re killed for $50,&#8221; said Carol Martin of the Downtown Eastside Women&rsquo;s Centre.</p>
<p>Martin and others familiar with the area say Hispanic and native drug dealers are doing a booming business on the eastside, and that women, predominantly First Nations women, are still the primary victims of violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our women are the mules, they are sex-trade workers, they&rsquo;re drug-addicted, they&rsquo;re holding or selling drugs for dealers and they&rsquo;re paying with their lives, now more than ever,&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>Honduran and Salvadoran dealers, doing a brisk trade Thursday just after &#8220;welfare Wednesday,&#8221; boast of profits as high as $15,000 a month.</p>
<p>Their collection methods, if they front a woman drugs that she uses or loses, can be brutal.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s been a few women lately thrown out of windows, at the Balmoral, the Regent, women missing fingers, wearing wigs because their heads have been shaved,&#8221; said Gladys Radek, organizer of the annual Walk 4 Justice in support of missing and murdered women in Vancouver and along the Highway of Tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever threw Ashley out chose the busiest time when the alley was full of people buying drugs, to make a point  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t rip us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin was one of the first to the scene after Machiskinic&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran over to her right after she fell and she was staring straight up, just gasping her last breaths  &mdash;  I was totally traumatized and I&rsquo;ve worked down here for 15 years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Eastside leaders charge that drug dealers are able to kill or maim with impunity, because Vancouver police, short of witnesses willing to come forward, write off the women&rsquo;s deaths as drug overdoses or suicides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence against women down here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is worse than ever  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s at an all-time high,&#8221; said Dave Dickson, a former Vancouver cop who worked in the eastside and is now a well-respected outreach worker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve known Ashley since she was 15. She was an attractive, quiet young woman and there is absolutely no way on earth that she committed suicide by jumping out of a fifth-floor window of the Regent Hotel,&#8221; said Dickson.</p>
<p>Standing in the alley in front of a memorial poster put up by Machiskinic&rsquo;s grieving mother, Cheryl Strongarm, Dickson is approached by people who trust him enough to talk, even with a reporter present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashley was a beautiful, good-spirited person and she didn&rsquo;t deserve what those assholes did to her, throwing her out in the alley like a bag of garbage,&#8221; said an angry young native man, hiding his face from nearby dealers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was right here when her body hit the street with a sound I&rsquo;ll never forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we intelligent people? Give me a break  &mdash;  Ashley didn&rsquo;t commit suicide by jumping out of the Regent Hotel. She was thrown out to send a message to pay up your drug debts, or else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiding his face behind an umbrella, he added: &#8220;Those dealers are just laughing. They know the police can&rsquo;t prove nothing down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marlene George of the Carnegie Centre, who will lead the Oct. 4 Sisters in Spirit March to the spot where Machiskinic perished, agreed: &#8220;There&rsquo;s a code of silence down here. The worst thing you can be is a rat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very difficult to get the police to speak about this and to acknowledge the drug dealers are behind these events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vancouver police spokesman Const. Lindsey Houghton called Machiskinic&rsquo;s death &#8220;a tragic rumour that has not been corroborated .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a case of what appears, after investigation, to be someone taking their own life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Houghton, who also knew Machiskinic, urged anyone with information to come forward to police, saying that her death is still an &#8220;ongoing investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the rain-sodden lane Thursday, a rose and a sheet of paper posted by the dead woman&rsquo;s mother paid tribute to &#8220;Ashley Nicole Lori Machiskinic. You are sadly missed and never forgotten &hellip; Rest in Peace, you&rsquo;re in a better place. Love Mommy.&#8221;<br>

<p>It never ceases to amaze me that feminists support mass immigration, legalizing &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; immigrants and flooding towns and villages full of violent third worlders who do not have any respect for the rights of women - rights that feminists struggled in the white world for over a hundred years to get.</p>
<p>Now, with a few years&rsquo; worth of mass migration of misogynists and machismo men from every backward place on earth, women are in a more dangerous situation than ever before.</p>
<p>White women are raped by black men to the tune of tens of thousands EACH year in the USA.  Who knows how many blacks, latinos and asian women are raped and abused here in the U.S. and Canada?</p>
<p>How does bringing the culture of abuse of females here help the cause of feminism?  And so many white feminists love them black studs and latin lovers, only to be cheated on and abused, sometimes worse.  It&rsquo;s so common that there are statistics for it.</p>
<p>As another question, what are salvadoran and honduran gang members doing in Canada?  Since there was no latino presence in Canada until a few years ago, none of them can possibly be there legally.  </p>

		<p>No one but a murderer or psychopathic sex pervert should be executed but:  these girls put themselves in jeopardy.  they are not victims of society. </p>
<p>Their deaths however should be punished though by death penalty, here and in Canada. Until killers feel fear, 24/7 by rapid and regular executions of their &#8220;colleagues&#8221;, excessive murder, rape and sexual assaults on children will increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the populations of both countries are soft and squeamish, however. Judges and politicians are happy to follow public opinion. Yes, Ruth Bader Ginsberg does represent the majority. Get used to it.</p>

		<p>If the dealers don&rsquo;t force deadbeats to pay their drug debts then more users will to try to stiff them. With 15K per month on the line I don&rsquo;t think they can stop this even if they do find and punish a few of those &#8220;debt collectors&#8221;. I figure with that kind of money on the line the drug gangs are already fighting over turf and killing each other. If fear of death from a rival drug gang doesn&rsquo;t discourage them then fear of prison won&rsquo;t either.</p>

<p>There have been 28,000 or something drug deaths south of the border and liberals say nothing. I think Bill Clinton, even Bill Clinton, would have said or done something. GM may go out of business, GM as in &#8216;what is good for GM is good for the country&rsquo; GM as in the hope for solar cars or water cars or even rocket or flying cars - certainly American leadership in an industry. Obama has done nothing - not to make this an Obama bashing post&hellip; it&rsquo;s just unbelievable liberals have done or said nothing, 28,000 dead. Infringing on a liberals right to smoke a dubbie would be too much, I guess. Sometimes the effort is just too much! <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got to say it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugs are bad, mmmmmkay?&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not &#8220;victims of society&#8221;, but victims of their own poor choices.  Using expensive, illegal narcotics will put the users in all sorts of trouble, ranging from sexual exploitation by the dealers to prostitution or committing theft to support the habit to basic dumb decisions made while stoned, and everything in between.  Use of hard drugs is very often the end of your life as you know it, and despite this being public knowledge, lots of folks do it anyway, but - doesn&rsquo;t make them do this to themselves.</p>

		<p>Visited Vancouver for the first time with my two boys from down under a few months ago and was astounded at how bad the drug problem is there &hellip;people begging downtown not to mention the spectacle of watching a whole block full of junkies on the eastside near Chinatown all hanging out for their next hit while I cycled and walked by.</p>
<p> Thought it was supposed to be the most livable place in the world but they left out the drug issue in the tour brochures and I get the feeling the authorities just wished it would all go away which it wont unfortunately so  have to conclude something is amiss here.</p>
<p><br>
As someone who abhors drugs of all types I must admit i dont know what all the answers are &hellip;do we come down hard on all the users/dealers or treat it as a medical and not a criminal problem?Ironically tended to think the cities on the upper west coast of US I visited after werent as bad although there seems to be a methamphetamine problem there also.</p>
<p>Maybe we could devote more resources to the problem and tackle it from various angles including education and drug treatment programs,at least I was only being hassled for small change and not being mugged or caught in a gun battle a la  Mexico which seems to be on the verge of becoming a narco state by the death toll and powerful drug cartels down there.  <br>

		<p><i>How does bringing the culture of abuse of females here help the cause of feminism? </i></p>
<p>Feminism is not the most rational of ideologies. But the answer is something like this: most feminists see White Heterosexual Men as the enemy. So they form alliances with third worlders to bring down White Heterosexual Men. Any problems that third worlders cause will be rationalized away as vestiges of racism or colonialism or apartheid, or whatever. </p>
<p>What is perverse is that too many White Heterosexual Men have drank the kool-ade of feminism and think that feminists want equality or some sort of beta-male sexual utopia. But it can be argued that since White Heterosexual Men are surrendering territory and population, feminists are following a primal mating strategy of selecting the new male overlords as their future mates  &mdash;  in this case, third world invaders, gang-bangers, terrorists, and drug dealers. </p>
