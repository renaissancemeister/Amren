<h1>A Little Mosque&rsquo;s Big Journey, From Winnipeg to Inuvik</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick White, Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By the time it reaches Inuvik, the prefab mosque strapped to Kevin Anderson&rsquo;s truck will have earned a place in the record books  &mdash;  even before the first worshippers pass through its door.</p>
<p>The stout structure will become the most northerly mosque in North America  &mdash;  and possibly the world  &mdash;  as well as the focus of what&rsquo;s believed to be the world&rsquo;s longest building move.</p>
<p>That significance is likely lost on motorists dodging Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s 30-foot-wide load as he diesels slowly past farms outside Selkirk, Man. A small alcove, or mihrab, juts from the rear of the cargo, destined soon to face Mecca rather than canola fields and cattle herds. But there is little else to indicate that this single haul represents so much to so many: the aggregate religious ambitions of an Arctic community&rsquo;s Muslims, the changing spiritual mores of Canada&rsquo;s North and a major logistical pain in the neck.</p>
<p>Three weeks from now, roughly 100 Muslim worshippers in Inuvik, NWT, are expected to pray at the building, thankful for a sturdy replacement for the 50-year-old trailer they currently use. The mosque&rsquo;s journey will take it from Winnipeg to Edmonton, then north to Hay River, where a barge will float it toward the shores of the Mackenzie Delta, home to Inuvik&rsquo;s 3,600 residents. &#8220;In Islam, to build a house of worship, the reward is a castle in paradise,&#8221; said Hussain Guisti, the man who&rsquo;s single-minded vision has propelled the project. &#8220;To do that we are doing like Star Trek and going where nobody has gone before.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one more example of Canada&rsquo;s crumbling religious frontiers. The country&rsquo;s Muslims  &mdash;  long seen as an urban population  &mdash;  are migrating to smaller resource towns in search of boomtown riches and a better quality of life. The Muslim population of the Northwest Territories alone is growing at a rate of 300 per cent every decade, according the latest Statistics Canada numbers. And Islamic groups in Timmins, Prince George and Whitehorse are all in various stages of mosque construction.</p>
<p>But Dr. Guisti and the small charity he helped start three years ago with the modest goal of building a mosque in Thompson, Man., decided to aim higher  &mdash;  in latitudinal terms at least.</p>
<p>After the Zubaidah Tallab Foundation successfully erected the Thompson mosque, Dr. Guisti went looking for high-profile projects. Inuvik was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity to help make Islamic history played a big part in it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The foundation researched building a mosque in Inuvik from scratch, but cost estimates ran over $550,000. Dr. Guisti found they could save $200,000 by having a Winnipeg company construct a prefab building and then haul the structure by road and river.</p>
<p>They had to design a building short enough to avoid power lines and bridges and design a course that avoided major highways.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one hell of a route,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson, the truck driver, from his cab. &#8220;We have to add a good 500 kilometres to the trip just taking less busy back roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson hopes to reach Hay River next week, just in time for a barge to tote the mosque to Inuvik by Sept. 24. That&rsquo;s where Ahmad Alkhalaf, project manager on the Inuvik end, will pluck the mosque from the barge and place it on two lots the local Muslim community purchased in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really quite an honour to be part of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Currently during Ramadan we get so many people coming to the trailer that we have to rent a community hall. It&rsquo;s a problem. The mosque will fix that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the faith of Manitoba Muslims has erected an unlikely building, it has yet to pay for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re still short about $75,000,&#8221; said Dr. Guisti. &#8220;But I have confidence in God. He&rsquo;s come through thus far.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I read the original article in the Globe &amp; Mail (online version). I noticed that there were many reader comments, not surprising given the subject matter. When I went to peruse the reader comments, at first glance, they seemed to reflect the views of persons who were comfortable with the Islamization of rural and northern Canada. A second glance indicated that a huge number of postings had been deleted on account of the fact &#8216;they violated usage requirements&rsquo;. I can only assume that these persons did not have their comments displayed because they voiced displeasure and hence were not politically correct.</p>
<p>The fact that Muslims are going to this much trouble to set up a mosque in Inuvik of all places should be a wake-up call to the rest of the civilized world. Inuvik is in the arctic, below freezing for 8 months of the year, has a small population, and isn&rsquo;t a major commercial or transport centre. Yet it&rsquo;s going to have a mosque whatever it takes. If this is happening in Inuvik, then no place in the developed countries are safe. There&rsquo;s no more option for flight&hellip; fighting will be the only viable choice.</p>

		<p>This is very disturbing. I never would have imagined 100 Moslems in Inuvik, Nunavut. I&rsquo;m sure the native Eskimos are none to happy about this. If not yet, just give them time. The fact that mosques are now being built in places like Nunavut, population 27,000, density less than 0.1 per square mile, a frozen wasteland that has never attracted immigrants, shows the spread and purpose of Islamic migration patterns. They have no real reason to be there, except to colonize the area for Allah.</p>

		<p>When Spain was invaded by the Moors it too centuries to evict them.  Let&rsquo;s go over this again kids, THEY HAD TO BE EVICTED.  That means that Muslims after centuries, even liberal ones such as the moors, can&rsquo;t assimulate with occidental Christian nations no matter how much time they get.</p>
<p>Remember two provebs, one occidental, one oriental:<br>
1.  Familiarity breeds contempt (occidental).<br>
2.  When you let the camel&rsquo;s nose in the tent, he soon brings it down (oriental).</p>
<p>Notice the &#8220;Dr&#8221; before the benefactor, and Notice the 911 terrorist were all highly educated, wait till the &#8220;hillbillies&#8221; get here from islamic countries, with their &#8216;honor killings&rsquo; and &#8216;assasinations,&rsquo; then you will find out what real islamics do to infidels who don&rsquo;t fall in line with their views.</p>

<p>When the time for fighting arrives, be warned that killing will be involved, this will NOT be fisticuffs but open warfare involving their deaths or YOURS! I have seen men die because they couldn&rsquo;t pull a trigger and that very same choice is headed our way. I have no problem with it, most people will.</p>

		<p>No good is going to come from this. Will the Muslims in this area consider the Muskox, Polar bear, Moose, and Bison halal or haraam (unclean)? These animals aren&rsquo;t mentioned in the Bible or the Koran. What happens when the sun is out 23 hours a day and it is Ramadan? Even if the &#8220;First Nations&#8221; hate the white man, this might be the time to join with him to oppose this group from taking over.     </p>

		<p>Whites must understand that followers of the cult of Islam are delegated by Muhammad to spread Islam around the world.</p>
<p>If any white Canadian has watched video of Canadian soldiers fighting and being killed in the Middle East take a moment to remember them.</p>
<p>They are dying not only as enemies of Islam, but more over because Muslims would rather die for the cult then live in poverty.</p>
<p>Muslim immigrants believe in Canada&rsquo;s ability to make money.</p>
<p>But if Canada&rsquo;s economy should ever plummet, believe that the cult followers of Islam will make converts or commit acts of terrorism until Canadians submit to their demands or live their lives marked by fear.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no more clearer example of Islamic colonization than what this story exemplifies. No sooner have we invited these foreign elements into our country, they want to re-arrange our furniture and proselytize their religious beliefs, even into the remotest parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Of course, the tax-funded Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) has all but aided &amp; abetted this movement by their promotion of the silly weekly television series called <i>&#8220;Little Mosque On The Prairies&#8221;</i>. This series has only served to embolden Muslims to establish colonizing outposts even further afield than our western provinces.</p>
<p>To locate the remote <i>Inuvik, Northwest Territories</i> of Canada, look for the red dot on the map <a href="https://ca.epodunk.com/profiles/northwest-territories/inuvik/2001047.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. </p>

		<p>As depressing as the idea of the islamization of a place like Inuvik is, the mosque over there actually won&rsquo;t be the northern-most one in the world. As far as I know, that distinction belongs to the Islamic Alnor Senter https://www.alnor.no/en_index.shtml in Tromsö, Northern Norway, at aproximately 69,40 degrees northern latitude compared to 68,21 degrees for Inuvik. </p>
<p>That is at least if they haven&rsquo;t got one somewhere in Northern Siberia as well. </p>

		<p>The Muslims in Inuvik are there strictly for the money.  It&rsquo;s mostly married men whose families remain in Edmonton.  They run the taxies and a couple corner stores.  It isn&rsquo;t really a settlement. One of their corner stores was busted for dealing drugs out of the store, but of course, it was back in operation a couple weeks after the bust.  The interesting thing is that the Muslims there aren&rsquo;t from any particular nation.  Iran, Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon.  They seem to get on all right with the local aboriginal population.  </p>

		<p>Inuvik&rsquo;s Muslims might have been transplanted there by the Canadian government. The government&rsquo;s &ldquo;sponsored refugee&rdquo; program pays non-whites moving and housing expenses, gives them welfare and helps them find jobs in out of the way places to &ldquo;diversify&rdquo; Canada. The Somalis who run the drug trade in Yellowknife, a small city in the Northwest Territories, came there as sponsored refugees.</p>
