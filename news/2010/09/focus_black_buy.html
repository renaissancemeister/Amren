			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Athena D. Merritt, Philadelphia Business Journal, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a black business owner, with two locations in Philadelphia, Omega Optical co-founder Steve Davis still finds it difficult to capture dollars spent by blacks.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s hardly alone in facing the problem.</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s 1 million black-owned businesses account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. Black buying power is estimated at $913 billion this year nationwide, meaning only 10 percent of dollars spent by blacks are supporting the enterprises, said Nicole Giles, acting executive director of the African American Chamber of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If our money was spent with these African-American&#150;owned businesses they could build capacity and in building capacity could hire more people,&#8221; Giles said.</p>
<p>Not being able to find one or having had a poor experience with one in the past are common excuses for not patronizing black-owned businesses, Giles said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lynne Hart hopes the exposure will help her business, Party Favors Ink, which provides custom wedding favors, grow so that it will be her sole source of income.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many instances I just don&rsquo;t get the business,&#8221; said Hart, who joined the chamber earlier this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black Spending Power</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black buying power outpaced all other minority groups in Pennsylvania last year, accounting for about $32 billion, or about 7.2 cents of every dollar spent, compared to 2.6 cents out of every dollar for Asians and 2.8 cents out of every dollar for Hispanics/Latinos.</p>
<p>Black buying power in Pennsylvania has increased 51 percent from 2000 to 2009, compared to 40 percent for whites, 101 percent for Asians and 134 percent for Hispanics/Latinos over the same period.</p>
<p>Nationwide, black buying power was $910 billion last year, or 8.5 percent.</p>

		<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t mind blacks supporting their own businesses, just as I don&rsquo;t mind Hispanics or Asians doing the same.  I just wants whites to be able to do the same without being called racists or getting sued.</p>

		<p>$910 Billion buying power, as in welfare, foodstamps, section 8, medical, ETC.? How much &#8220;disposable&#8221; buying power real $&rsquo;s do they have to actually buy things with? How much of that $910 billion was actually earned?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If our money was spent with these African-Americanâ€“owned businesses they could build capacity and in building capacity could hire more people,&rdquo; Giles said.</p>
<p>The inference being that black companies would give preference to blacks when hiring workers.The Philadelphia Business Journal apparantly has no problem with this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Lynne Hart hopes the exposure will help her business, Party Favors Ink, which provides custom wedding favors, grow so that it will be her sole source of income&#8221;  I wish her luck, because blacks don&rsquo;t get married.  I remember reading Thomas Sowell saying that during segregation, black business and communities thrived because they were close knit and depended on each other.  Integration killed the black community and the surrounding black business interests. Blacks depended on themselves because they had to, now they shake down whitey and perpetually have their hand out. This is progress in the minds of the likes of Jesse and Big Al.</p>

<p>AGAIN, even blacks have bad experiences with blacks and make choices based on their experience. When whites do, it&rsquo;s called &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

		<p> The following is what happened in Philadelphia when black minority builders were chosen to rebuild homes on Osage Ave.after they were destroyed in a fire during a police altercation with move members on May 13, 1985.     After more than a year in temporary housing, residents returned to their rebuilt homes in the fall of 1986. That winter, the roofs started leaking. </p>
<p>Next came discoveries of defective plumbing and wiring, bad flooring, nails popping out of walls, burst pipes, flooded basements and backyards and broken appliances. Replacement trees have since uprooted parts of the sidewalk and are strangling pipes. </p>
<p>Milton Williams, 61, has had five stoves, four roofs and two living room ceilings. Today, his front and back windows look out on boarded-up homes.To me this is a good example of why I think black people do not bother spending money with black minority businesses.Common sense is always a good choice no matter if a person is white or black.<br>

		<p>I can remember watching the local news as a kid and them covering &#8220;Black Dollar Days&#8221;. Banks in South Central LA, Compton, and North Long Beach would put two dollar bills and Susan B. Anthony coins into local circulation so you would know this money was spent by a black person living in those areas. Sure enough I would go to the mall(that was in our  predominantly white city BTW) and buy something getting a two dollar bill or a  Susan B.  Anthony coin for change. I can remember being at one register in the mall and a black lady very rudely complaining to the clerk that she did not want any Susan B. Anthony coins for change because they are often mistaken for quarters. This black lady did not understand that she and others brought this scourge of misidentified currency into circulation then into our community. My mother had done some shopping at the mall and was given some ten dollars worth of these coins. The only thing I could deduce from this demonstration of black economic power as a kid was they don&rsquo;t spend their money(some of it earned most it given by government) in their own communities they spend all of it in ours.</p>

		<p>When I was growing up in New Orleans, there was a thriving community of black-owned businesses along S. Rampart St. Then the civil rights act came along, and blacks celebrated their new-found right to shop by abandoning those businesses that had provided them with goods and jobs for so many years. </p>

		<p>As #8 LOUDMOUTH 57 pointed out, one of the main reasons for the problem is that blacks assume that black-produced products are substandard  &mdash;  and for good reason.  In the old days of segregation, blacks bought more from black-owned businesses, and they had little recourse if an item turned out to be ill-made or if they were unable to get the seller to make an exchange or reimburse them.  Now, it&rsquo;s still probably easier to return items to non-black-owned businesses, and the quality of mainstream products is more certain.  Also, if the buyer is ill-bred and wants to make an anti-whitey spectacle, only a white enterprise will do.</p>

		<p>When I was in high school and college, I had many, many working-class jobs like auto mechanic, car wash employee, pizza cook and moving company driver/laborer. In some of these jobs I worked with large numbers of Blacks and the one thing I noticed about Blacks in all of these jobs is that Blacks absolutely hated it when another Black was in charge. Blacks seemed determined to keep all other Blacks at the absolute lowest common denominator possible (the very definition of Marxism/Socialism/Communism). We see it in the schools where any Black who excels is punished for &#8220;acting White.&#8221; Blacks probably see other Blacks who own and operate businesses as putting on airs and thinking &#8220;dey better dan&#8221; other Blacks.</p>
<p>Of course in all the jobs I had, any Black who was in a position of authority was generally incompetent and very, very touchy and defensive about everything. I&rsquo;m 55 years old and work in an office and the Blacks and Hispanics who have authority are always the least competent and are EXTREMELY difficult to deal with. What they think of as &#8220;pride&#8221; is simply an adolescent, chip-on-the-shoulder attitude that looks everywhere for &#8220;disrespect.&#8221; </p>
<p>Their attitude seems to be that once they have achieved a position of some authority that their work is now done and they can coast on the prestige of the position AND take credit for everything that all the White people do.</p>
<p>Of course our cowardly, treasonous government is on the side of Blacks and Hispanics and that means that if you are White, the government is your enemy. That deeply stupid, affirmative-action Obama is the worst enemy this country has ever had.</p>

		<p>Notice how everything envolving blacks is ALWAYS about race. They claim whitey is the most racist, yet they always use the terms &#8220;proud black man&#8221;, &#8220;strong black woman&#8221; or &#8220;black business&#8221;. Can&rsquo;t you just be a proud man or stong woman? It&rsquo;s pretty obvious your black.</p>

		<p>Perhaps I read it here a year or so ago, but another problem black entrepreneurs, entertainers, etc. deal with is that their fellow blacks are always looking for the &#8220;hook up.&#8221; Blacks don&rsquo;t want to pay full price for groceries and feel perfectly at home asking a cashier or manager to &#8220;hook a brotha up&#8221;  &mdash;   haggling where no haggling should occur. Blacks don&rsquo;t want to see other blacks succeed unless the fruits of that labor are passed directly on to them. Simply trifling.</p>
