		<p>I see.  Anything that requires smarts or hard manual labor is a job blacks can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do.  Anything that allows blacks to easily demand quotas and allows them to hide their shoddy or half pace work within the masses is filled with blacks.  Got it.  By the way&hellip;&hellip;aren&rsquo;t those percentages about TWICE what they should be, given the black population?</p>

		<p>Regarding #5 and #7 top occupations for blacks, there is basically one human being and one human being alone who is responsible for that, and his name is William L. Clay, Sr.  He represented the Congressional district which included North St. Louis City, its historically and currently black section, from 1968-2000.  He retired in 2000, to be succeeded by his son, William L. Clay, Jr.  From some time in the 1980s until the Democrats lost the House in 1994, Clay Sr. was the chairman of the House Post Office Committee.  And he used that power to ram affirmative action down the P.O.&rsquo;s throat in a big way, even more so than the typical Federal agency.</p>

		<p>So despite all the liberal hold-hands Hollywood imagery trying to convince us otherwise, blacks still hold the same small-time service jobs that we&rsquo;ve always seen them have in movies from the 50&rsquo;s or earlier.</p>
<p>And what about &#8220;managers of diversity enforcement departments&#8221;? I&rsquo;m sure blacks make up a inordinant amount of those &#8220;jobs&#8221; as well.</p>

		<p>Wow, can all kinds of fascinating conclusions be drawn from these figures!</p>
<p>The postal service (government) employs half of all those on the top ten list (well, no big surprise there).</p>
<p>What the heck are &#8220;Residential advisors?&#8221;</p>
<p>And as far as the &#8220;10 Occupations with Smallest Percentages of African-Americans:&#8221; despite this, how many times have you looked at a magazine or TV ad and seen a black portrayed as an artist, scientist or some other white collar profession?</p>
<p>Most shocking of all is the fact that the liberal Marxstream media is one of the smallest employers of blacks. In fact, dare I say that the MSM is &#8220;underwhelmingly black?&#8221;</p>

		<p>That figure for Postal Workers is misleading.  Blacks dominate all the major processing centers and most of the larger post offices within 20 miles of major cities.  The only reason the % isn&rsquo;t higher is because collectively there are postal workers in just about every town in the country.  Are you still wondering why the Postal Service is going down the tubes?  I watched it from the inside for 35 years.  Wait till these billiant people start running our healthcare system.</p>

		<p>Hmm. I was expecting &#8220;Computer Programming&#8221; to be one of the 10 jobs with the highest percentage of our black brethren. I mean, since there is so much high-quality software being released by black software companies, they clearly have a natural talent for the work.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can still sometimes observe  the evil phenomenon of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; at racist software companies, where whites are hired at a higher rate than their percentage of the population. The interesting thing is that the black staff will invariably put those Whites to shame with the elegance of their coding, and the sheer magnitude of work they can get done in a day. In fact, the blacks in these companies are often forced to work overtime just to fix the sloppy coding that their white coworkers put out. </p>
<p>In the end, however, such racist software companies are forced to change their hiring policy or face the risk of bankruptcy due to severe competition from more able black companies.</p>
<p>If Computer Programming is not in the top ten, it&rsquo;s got to be number 11 or 12.</p>
<p> I mean, it must be, right?</p>

		<p>In the last 20 years of working at our local post office I&rsquo;ve seen it go to almost 90% blacks/hispanics/samoans. The only whites you see at a post office are either the temporary (3-6 months), or the older whites that just don&rsquo;t want to retire.</p>
<p>I had an office down near the hiring clerk and she told me  hiring is done by quotas - not test scores.</p>

		<p>So in the 70&rsquo;s after taking the Federal placement test, the PACE Exam, I received a score of 103 out of 100.  My actual score was a 98 with five extra points for mil service.  Anyway, I tried to get a job at the post office.  I went to branch after branch and was turned down everywhere.  One of the last branches I went to had a white male postmaster who was a vet.  He took me into his office and told me that he would lose his job if what he was about to tell me got out.  He showed me a two piles of apps, one contained black applicants as well as women, the other, white males.  They were ordered to not hire any white males, mil vets or not.  I went elsewhere for employment but I have never wondered why the mail service was bad. From about the late 60&rsquo;s on the PO became the black domain.  So today, when you see the dearth of white workers, you will know that the USPS has hired based on race, not test scores or interest by white males.</p>

<p>Oh, the fun we could have with this one. But I&rsquo;ll restrain myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say that on the Postal Service test, black applicants are given an extra 10 points just for being black. Which is odd, since I&rsquo;ve always heard that race is just a social construct. I mean, this is sounding like blacks are actually different and need special help.</p>

		<p>I design and repair complex electronic equipment, mostly for the medical field. It is a mentally challenging job, and bull won&rsquo;t get you through. In 35+ years on the job, I have only seen one (1) black. And he didn&rsquo;t spend his time learning his trade and improving his skills. He spent his time surrounding himself with guilt ridden whites who would do his work for him.</p>

		<p>Engineers of all sorts must be a low percent occupation for blacks. Math is not a skill most blacks embrace. Even middle school arithmetic is a challenge, as national test scores show.<br>
So we import engineers from China and India. Ugh.</p>
<p>As for USPS, it is a mainstay of middle class blacks. But it will shed employees through attrition or go out of business. Total employment already is way down, and blacks who came in large numbers in the 1980&rsquo;s and 1990&rsquo;s will retire in ten to twenty years, or earlier, if collective bargaining agreements are modified. Despite the domination of blacks in congressional postal matters, the erosion of postal mail volume ensures a smaller future workforce, primarily of carriers,many of which remain white.   </p>

<p>Please note no Pullman Porters on the list. There was a time black men could find honest, long-term work tossing suitcases on and off trains. Not a whole lot of fun, perhaps, but it provided the basis for a decent blue-collar life for many a decent black family. </p>
<p>Instead, a half-century of Radical Egalitarianism, misguided social programs, and endless welfare have destroyed the black work ethic AND the black family. </p>

		<p>I figure actors and models must be high on the list of jobs for African-Americans. On TV,billboard ads.and movies it appears African Americans make up at least fifty percent of the images one sees in the entertainment and advertisement industries.In entertainment they seem very much to be over represented because they only make up between fifteen to seventeen percent of the U.S. population yet it seems like every other image on TV or in the movies is that of an African American.</p>

Comments numbered 14, 15, and 16 have broadened the discussion to include preferential hiring.  </p>
<p>In a recent community meeting Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland said that black applicants for jobs are given different tests that are easier than the ones given to white applicants for the same job. </p>
<p>Congressman Bartlett is elderly and may be confusing this practice with &#8220;race norming&#8221;, a device that, I understand, was used many years ago by the US Employment Service but outlawed when Congress found out about it. </p>
<p>&#8220;Race norming&#8221; meant that blacks and whites took the same test but blacks were rated only against other blacks, while whites were rated against everyone who took the test. </p>
<p>That meant if a white made a score of 85, he scored higher than 84 percent of everyone who took the test, but if a black got the same score it meant he ranked higher than only 84 percent of the other blacks who took the test.</p>
<p>An employer, seeing a black and white with the same score, under the standard of affirmative action that prevailed then, would be obliged to prefer the black applicant hecause he was both equally qualified and also the victim of &#8220;past discrimination&#8221;.</p>
<p>When I mailed Congressman Bartlett documentary evidence of racial discrimination against whites in the Federal Government he replied with a curt letter ordering me not to communicate with his local office or to telephone his office in Washington, D.C.  He ordered that all communication should be by mail to him in D.C.  I obediently sent him a letter with a stamped, self-addressed card for him to reply on, but it&rsquo;s been well over a year since then and no answer.</p>
<p>Racial discrimination is forbidden by the 14th Amendement to the Constitution and by the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the oath of office of Federal officials pledges them to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>
<p>Congressman Bartlett?  Where are you?</p>
<p>If this is the reaction to flagrant, demonstrable lawbreaking by minorities now, what will happen when they soon become the majority?  </p>

<p>Which is what makes the re-release of &#8216;North by Northwest&rsquo; so funny to view.

And the FBI chase, which turns up all Caucasian &#8216;red caps&rsquo; in the Train station, would make one think that here, at last, was a &#8216;whites-only profession.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They do rather a poor job at this. They favor black patients over others. If neglect or abuse is involved, 4 out of five times it&rsquo;s done by a black care-giver to a helpless white charge.</p>

		<p>Did you ever wonder why you can&rsquo;t get your name off the terrorist watch list?  (60 min has done stories on this).  It&rsquo;s because federal agency after federal agency has increased the percentage of black employees until they can&rsquo;t perform their mandated function.  I just can&rsquo;t wait until my health care is run by and agency with 80% blacks.  At some point the whites just can&rsquo;t pick up the slack. </p>

		<p>I will also mention that on all the camps I have been on in Iraq, Kuwait and here in Afghanistan, ALL of the postal facilities are run by blacks, and ALL have the obligatory TV with the obligatory blacksetball game on all the time.</p>
