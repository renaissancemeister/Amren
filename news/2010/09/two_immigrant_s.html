			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristen A. Graham and Jeff Gammage, Philadelphia Inquirer, September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two newly arrived Chinese immigrants recently were attacked at Bok High School in South Philadelphia, authorities said.</p>
<p>The incident occurred Friday morning, when the freshman boys were kicked and punched by a large group of students, according to Philadelphia School District and police accounts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One assailant has been arrested and charged with assault. The 14-year-old, whom school officials said had already been suspended this school year, is African American, as are 72 percent of Bok students. About 15 percent are Asian, 7 percent are Latino, and 5 percent are white.</p>
<p>Early district reports indicated that the incident occurred on a freshman hazing day and that race was not a motivating factor, but the investigation is ongoing, school officials said.</p>
<p>Helen Gym, a board member of Asian Americans United, took exception with that conclusion. &#8220;It&rsquo;s our understanding that two recent immigrant Asian youths were beaten and sent to the hospital, and this didn&rsquo;t happen to other kids at that school,&#8221; said Gym. &#8220;For the district to say that it wasn&rsquo;t racial seems awfully premature. It feels an awful lot like they&rsquo;re normalizing violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gym said her organization was &#8220;deeply troubled&#8221; by the district&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, we feel like we are starting to revisit the same troubling issues we encountered all last year,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Tensions have been running high in South Philadelphia since December, when seven Asian students required hospital treatment after being attacked by groups of mostly African American students at South Philadelphia High. That incident, the subject of a federal investigation, was racially motivated, authorities have said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incident happened on the vocational school&rsquo;s sixth floor during a class change. Two Asian students  &mdash;  one 14 and one 15  &mdash;  were walking to class when the 15-year-old was attacked by about 10 students, the victim told police.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old jumped in to help his friend, and was then attacked himself.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re treating this very seriously,&#8221; said the principal of the 1,200-student school.</p>
<p>But &#8220;I&rsquo;m pleased to say that this was an isolated incident by some kids who didn&rsquo;t take my advice that we wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate anything,&#8221; Melton [principal Larry Melton] said late Monday. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No other Freshman Day incidents were reported at Bok, Edison or Washington.</p>

		<p>One of the attackers had already been suspended from the school, according to the article.  This begs the question, &#8220;Why was he at the school beating up folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless the suspension had already expired, I think a criminal trespass arrest is warranted.</p>

		<p>White Humanity just sits backs and watches these non white vs. non white stories and waits for the part two:  minorities wouldn&rsquo;t be taking out their rage on each other if White Humanity were being held accountable for oppressing and marginalizing people of color. </p>
<p>Or, we could get up and march with &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221; signs while shouting our demands that Asians confess their racism against the blacks and begin atoning by refusing to date their own kind and pledging to date only blacks, just like hideous White liberal elites demand of our beautiful White daughters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks beat up Chinese freshmen. School: attack not racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can continue to inanely make denials like this about racial attacks between non-whites&hellip;.most especially blacks and everybody else&hellip;.until they&rsquo;re blue in the face, but they&rsquo;re not going to change reality one iota.</p>
<p>The deteriorating situation is beginning to accelerate right now, and can only get worse as non-whites continue to increase in numbers and come in closer contact with one another.  The deteriorating economic situation will only add to the inter-group resentment and hatred.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that multicultural societies are destined to fail and the only thing that will keep the inhabitants from tearing at each other is unparalleled prosperity in a society that demands civility and is able to keep up a non-stop program of brainwashing, touting diversity, or a strong dictatorship that keeps everybody in line.  If either of these situations lose influence over the populace for whatever reason the society collapses into inter-group fighting.</p>
<p>This American empire is cracking badly, and it is rapidly losing power to control the masses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like following a script.    It&rsquo;s possible to anticipate each downward trend and event as if we were watching a movie.  </p>

		<p>That principal is one of &#8220;those&#8221; guys.  A real piece of work.  I saw an interview from him about last year&rsquo;s incidents and he was so namby-pamby liberal (&#8220;Oh, there&rsquo;s no racism here&#8221;) that it was sickening.</p>
<p>So the Chinese and other Asian immigrants are finding that the liberal establishment sticks up for blacks and latinos against them.  That&rsquo;s because those two groups are their bread and butter.  As long as blacks are helpless and dependent, their behavior will be rationalized away in some very bizarre ways.  (Readers here have already learned about many such things.)</p>
<p>Asians work hard and build wealth, so even though they are non-white and non-jewish and thus theoretically supposed to be wards of the liberals, those self-same libs lump asians in with with middle class population that they despise.</p>
<p>Anyways, I wonder who those 5% of whites are who still go to a hell hole like those philly schools are.</p>

		<p>Boy, you&rsquo;ve got to feel sorry for the non-black 28%, and especially for the 5% that are white. Being stuck in a majority black environment is always somewhere between merely disgusting to outright horrible. This is what happens to those who can&rsquo;t afford to just go to a better, whiter place. Wilding, flash mobbing, a gang of ten attacking one or two individuals, is not just &#8220;hazing&#8221;. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll have another &#8220;Jena 6&#8221; march by blacks to support the attackers.</p>

<p>I am so impressed with the Bantu. Why, I just cannot say enough good things about them.</p>
<p>Those Bantu don&rsquo;t give a damn about their future other than was is occurring during the next five minutes. Those Asian kids came here to study and have a better life. Such a contrast.</p>
<p>Freshman &#8220;hazing&#8221; they call it. The Bantu is a bully and likes being a bully. Relishes the deed. Yeah for the Bantu.</p>

		<p>From Post # 4: &#8220;the only thing that will keep the inhabitants from tearing at each other is unparalleled prosperity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually what currently keeps our multicultural rainbow from tearing each other apart are the generous welfare benefits from the Federal Government (bribes paid to keep the peace).  When those run out (and they will), then watch out!  Post-Katrina New Orleans has already shown us what will happen when &#8220;the People&#8221; have to go without cold beer and flush toilets for 3 days.  Imagine Detroit, Chicago, or LA with no food stamps, Section 8 housing, Aid to Dependent Children, free medical care, free transportation, etc.     </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Two newly arrived Chinese immigrants recently were attacked at Bok High School in South Philadelphia&hellip;kicked and punched by a large group of (black) students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the difference:</p>
<p>If this were White students attacked by blacks, you can be sure it wouldn&rsquo;t be and item, anywhere, in a major paper such as the &#8216;Philly Inky&rsquo;, or any other propaganda media rag for that matter.</p>
<p>And, I doubt the black perpetrators would be suspended; if they were, the White victims would be blamed as well and suspended.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Helen Gym, a board member of Asian Americans United&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, what do you know, an Asian-American advocacy spokeswoman from an Asian-American advocacy group watching out for and standing up for Asian-American interests  &mdash;   challenging the school district&rsquo;s contention that a pack of 10 blacks attacking one Asian had  &#8216;Absolutely Nothing To Do With Race!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Imagine a White Advocate from a White Advocacy Group standing up for a White child beaten up by a pack of blacks and NOT referred to by the propaganda media as a Nazi, Supremacist, Hater, or K member, his advocacy organization NOT loudly denounced as a Hate Group by Potok, et. al.</p>
<p>I reckon Asians, to escape sub-par black schools, and to protect their children from violent blacks, will soon open schools in Philly for their own children  &mdash;  schools based on &#8216;language&rsquo; or &#8216;cultural heritage&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ll say (and open to anyone), fully approved by the media and government.</p>
<p>Would that we Whites could do the same for our own precious White children.</p>

		<p>If the Asians insist on moving to America, somebody should at least warn them how dangerous a mostly black public school is. Not to mention the extremely low quality of education that&rsquo;s on offer there. As Asians generally tend to be a studious people, the kids would have gotten a much better education in China, even considering the faults of the Chinese government.  </p>

		<p>At least the Asian kids fought back against the brave, courageous and manly blacks who outnumbered them 10 to 2.</p>
<p>Hispanics fight back too and often turn the tables on their black tormentors.</p>
<p>With whites you can usually find one man who will fight back but when he starts beating the black other blacks will join in as other whites look on helplessly and gawp.</p>

		<p>You know, &#8216;hazing day&rsquo; is something that would not have passed muster in the &#8216;liberal 70s&rsquo; (and early 80s) when I was in school.</p>
<p>If there is an -expected- day of making the Freshmen feel like dirt, then the school administration has already screwed up.</p>
<p>I too admire a 14 year old that doesn&rsquo;t let his friend go down, 10 v.1.</p>
<p>But I have to question if this really meets the definition of a racial crime in the traditional sense of being &#8220;I hate Chinese!&#8221; sense.  Blacks run in packs.  Black boys have a lot of adrenaline and testosterone and thus think with their fists.  Blacks have very poorly developed pre frontal cortexes which due most of the &#8216;you gotta be kidding me?&rsquo; screening of R-brain instinctive impulses before passing the frontal lobes for execution.  Finally, blacks are territorial.</p>
<p>If this is racist, it is racist because it is a genetically based predisposition.  It may even be that they don&rsquo;t see it as aberrant or out of the ordinary, anymore than any other predator is surprised when it runs among a herd of prey and thinks: &#8220;They&rsquo;re there, I&rsquo;m me, let&rsquo;s eat!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Until and unless we start to acknowledge and understand the expressed genotypical trait characteristic differences among nominally &#8216;all human&rsquo; peoples, we will never understand that &#8216;being racist&rsquo; and &#8216;acting with racial behaviors&rsquo; are two different things.</p>
<p>Once we do, we will start to measure people&rsquo;s compatibility with our society in a different fashion.</p>

		<p>I have lived this nightmare.</p>
<p>In 1975 my father was told in no uncertain terms I&rsquo;d better try real hard to learn to &#8220;Get along&#8221;. One might reasonably ask why. As I had </p>
<p>A. Gotten tired of getting beat up while waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>B. Gotten tired of praying the bathroom was empty so I could use it in peace. ( The uncleanliness allowed stand up activity only)</p>
<p>C.  Gotten extremely tired of being hassled in class particularly when having the nerve to participate.</p>
<p>D. Gotten tired of not being able to eat in peace.</p>
<p>My offense.</p>
<p>I organized some of the other white boys and started a fight in the boys room and the yard. This was deemed worthy of suspension and threat of being sent to Daniel Boone. ( the last chance disciplinary school at the time) . My father sent me out of the room and I believe told the creature behind the desk a thing or two. I ended up living with an uncle outside of the city.  Nothing has changed.<br>

		<p>Poster #4 has stated things that are completely true and have precedents all throughout history and in the modern world.  The only way any multicultural empires have held together is if the founding group dominates, even if it loses majority status, it still rules by force of will (and arms).</p>
<p>However, the rising non-dominant groups yearn for greater control, assert their interests over others, and when the will of the dominant group falters, all hell breaks lose as the various &#8216;squabbling ethnic groups&rsquo; turn on each other.</p>
<p>As much as I wish that America could go back to the way it was when I was young, I know it&rsquo;s not gonna&rsquo; happen.  The main benefit of the Asians is that they are a buffer zone between us and the blacks now, and the blacks can beat them up (and latinos too) instead of us.</p>
<p>Also, we can throw the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; stuff right back in the faces of the liberals, for the simple fact of the matter is that all these other races and cultures have nothing to do with each other and sometimes outright despise each other.  The libtards themselves live in lily-white neighborhoods too while forcing working class and middle class whites to take in Hmong, Mexicans, blacks, etc.</p>
<p>We must FORCE through shame, logic, whatever, the libtards to &#8216;integrate their own neighborhoods.  We must FORCE them to spend their time and resources getting Chinese and blacks to sing kumbaya together, latinos and Persians to marry each other, Koreans and Haitians to hire each other in their businesses, Arabs and Jews to love each other, etc&hellip;..<br>

		<p>What do you want to bet those black &#8220;kids&#8221; were probably appreciably bigger then the Chinese students were? Possibly older too as blacks are frequently much slower to move along the educational system. At my high school we had blacks who were in their early twenties! Bullying, cowardice and racial animosity are the story here, but it won&rsquo;t be spun that way since the perpetrators are not &#8220;evil&#8221; Whites. Speaking of which, how would you like to be one of those one-in-twenty White kids at that school? Imagine the intimidation and harassment they must be subjected to. </p>

		<p>African Americans &#8220;are 72 percent of Bok students. About 15 percent are Asian, 7 percent are Latino, and 5 percent are white.&#8221;<br>

 <br>
Only a few blacks went to the schools I attended.  When blacks are in the minority most try to behave.  When they are in the majority they behave the way they want to behave. <br>
 <br>
White liberals rarely have contact with many blacks. Those they know personally are usually exceptional, or they are in subordinate positions that they accept without resentment.  This makes it easy for white liberals to see blacks as unoffending victims of irrational color prejudice, whose fairly minor deficiencies are caused by white racism.    <br>
