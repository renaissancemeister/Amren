<h1>Canadian View of Immigration Sours in Wake of Tamil Ship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jane Taber, Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Canadian attitudes toward immigration are hardening as debate over the fate of a shipload of Tamils continues to make headlines, a new survey suggests.</p>
<p>An Angus Reid online poll says 46 per cent of Canadians believe immigration is having a negative effect on the country, a five-point increase from August, 2009. This compares to 34 per cent of the poll respondents who believe it is having a positive effect, a decrease of three points since last August.</p>
<p>Not only that, almost half  &mdash;  or 44 per cent  &mdash;  of the 1,007 polled believe illegal immigrants take jobs away from Canadian workers, compared to 38 per cent who think that they are employed in jobs Canadians don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted Sept. 2 and 3. For the past month there has been much publicity surrounding the arrival of the MV Sun Sea from Thailand. The fate of the 492 Tamil passengers remains unclear, The Globe and Mail reported Thursday that one man has been detained because of suspected links to the Tamil Tiger terrorist organization.</p>
<p>The Harper government has repeatedly suggested terrorists are among the passengers on board. A week after the ship arrived, Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed to put a stop to such migrant vessels, saying he would not &#8220;hesitate to strengthen the laws if we need to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Canadians are pretty concerned that a whole boat of people comes  &mdash;  not through any normal application process, not through any normal arrival channel  &mdash;  and just simply lands,&#8221; he said at the time.</p>
<p>Fifty per cent of poll respondents want to deport the passengers and crew of the Tamil ship back to Sri Lanka, even if their refugee claims are legitimate; 32 per cent of respondents say they should be allowed to stay in Canada as refugees.</p>
<p>A regional breakdown shows that a majority of Albertans (52 per cent) and Ontarians (55 per cent) want the passengers and crew deported. This compares to 43 per cent of Atlantic Canadians and 39 per cent of British Columbians; 50 per cent of Quebeckers believe the Tamils should be deported.<br>

		<p>Could it possibly be that my fellow citizens are finally waking up to the &#8220;browning&#8221; of Canada?   One can only hope.  For many years now, we have been told by liberal multiculturalists that new immigrants are necessary in order to sustain a large tax-paying work force in this country. In that case, why have we all but cut off immigration from Britain and Europe?  It would appear that very few of the Third World newcomers are brain surgeons or research scientists.   The vast majority work at menial tasks such as driving taxis, cleaning office buildings or as manual laborers on construction sites. We are told that they are doing the jobs that Canadians no longer want.  So&hellip;no white Canadians want to drive taxis, clean offices or work in construction anymore?   Perhaps this poll shows that the tide is turning against our open-door policy towards Third World newcomers.   Still, it may be too late.<br>
The vast majority of whites in Canada have reached zero population growth while Third Worlders tend to breed large families.   At some future date, the numbers will tip in their favour and they will take over.  </p>

		<p>Keep in mind that most Canadians do not feel free to express such opinions in daily talk - they are afraid to. So these numbers are under estimates of true feelings. Canadians are not exposed to debate on immigration and so never hear well articulated criticism of immigration. You have to search very hard to find any leadership opposed to immigration. Unlike other social debates, there is very little that Canadians can actually do if they want restriction. While these opinion numbers are heartening, it is hard to see them getting mobilized into action. I still direct Canadians to American sources of info and organizations. That&rsquo;s still the best way to eventually influence Canada.</p>

		<p>With more than ample time at my disposal after receiving word that two housebreakers had intentions of breaking into my house, should I respond in similar fashion as the Canadian gov&rsquo;t and passively sit on my hands and wait for the inevitable? </p>
<p>Taking this analogy further, would I then escort the two unknown, uninvited cretins from my now-broken window to my kitchen table, while also providing them with free accommodation in my spare bedroom? And then allow them free reign in my house while I attend to my 40 hr/wk job to help support these unknown, freeloading housebreakers for an indeterminate time?</p>

		<p> I tend to agree. Here on the oil patch, most of the peers of mine have issues with all immigration at this time. Around my small towm(pop.&gt;8000) Most stories now are of the wealth of low quality(insert 500) peoples from the Philippines, whom have most of the low wage, entry level jobs through most N. Alberta. We all have teens now whoe most cannot acquire thier first job. What makes me mad, is my prediction 2 years ago when the first arrived and conquered the fast food work, was to watch and see how many of the women will be pregnant before long. Pretty close to 90% I think I predicted. And I, was right. Now they can&rsquo;t go back according to our laws. 1 in 3 have two children now. </p>
<p> The blacks down south, are a different story. But just as harmful.  </p>

		<p>Americans should be concerned about this story because these people are Muslims and the Canadian/U.S border is much easier to cross than our southern one.</p>
<p>Five years ago I happened to be at a private home and met THE general of Thailand&rsquo;s military.  We talked about the radical Muslims there.  His hope was that reason would bring them around.  I told him that I hoped he was right, but that I doubted it.  Now, these same people they have had so much trouble with are arriving in North America.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if most of these anti-Tamils are Multiculty Torontonians because the eastern part of the city is solidly Tamil and Tamils dont know how to make a good impression. They smell of body odor &amp; spices, seem unable to control the tone of their voice, dress in baggier clothing than the Africans and are just as hard to look at &amp; criminally oriented. They&rsquo;re so bad that even Africans hate them. You dont have to even be White to be offended by Tamils, some of whom resemble Ferengi.</p>

		<p>These Tamils are not legitimate refugees because the war in Sri Lanka is over.  Moreover, why did they not merely travel the much shorter distance to India?  As a signer of the same international treaties as Canada, India is also obliged to provide sanctuary to legitimate refugees, which these of course are not (southern India has a huge Tamil population, so these folks would fit right in).  If they can be called &#8220;refugees&#8221; at all, they are a sort of economic refugee.</p>

		<p>Just as Michael C. Scott (#7) exposes these Tamils, so the same circumstances expose the Haitians who have been invading the US. If the Haitians were truly fleeing political persecution, they wouldn&rsquo;t risk a hazardous 600-mile trip   &mdash;   they&rsquo;d sail just 50 miles across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_passage" rel="nofollow">Windward Passage</a> to Cuba. Better still, they could simply walk, bike, drive or hitchhike into the next-door Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Like the Haitians here, the Tamils in Canada are nothing more than freeloaders trolling for handouts.</p>

		<p>on post #6: &#8220;Ferengi&#8221;&hellip;what? </p>
<p>I had know idea what they were until about a minute later, then it clicked.  Is it possible that our President is Tamil?<br>
Ann was one traveling lady to whom literally anything was possible (except happiness through liberalism).</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m talking about Barack, I happened to catch his press conference and the question involving civilian trials vs. military tribunals.  He thinks military justice is fine for those captured in &#8220;theater&#8221; of war.  For the fundy Islamists isn&rsquo;t that the entire world?  </p>
<p>There was a good 9/11 remembrance today, but I&rsquo;ll still have to wait for a permanent, fitting Memorial. I live far away from New York and have only seen pictures of ground zero.</p>
<p>If the Islamic Center is started, would a vertical Memorial be permitted by our governments; what if they plan something taller than the Burlington Coat Factory?<br>
Arab culture (and Persian) may be stilted but they seem to produce enough people that can talk their way out of a suicide vest and come up with long range planning.</p>

<p>Yeah ummm, no they couldn&rsquo;t.  After generations of experience with Haitians, Dominicans shoot them on sight, unless they are part of a heavily guarded work detail that is sent back over the border at nightfall.</p>
<p>Can you blame them?  Twice in the recent past, Haiti has committed genocide.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a majority of Canadians were ever in favor of their country&rsquo;s insane open-borders policy.  In their heart of hearts most probably knew there would be dire long-term consequences.  But as elsewhere in the Western world, they were lulled into a sense of complacency by a high standard of living.  Now with the economy sliding toward the abyss, the danger becomes more apparent and people are beginning to wake up.</p>
