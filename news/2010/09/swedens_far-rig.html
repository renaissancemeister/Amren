<h1>Sweden&rsquo;s Far-Right Furious: &#8216;Democracy in Danger&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Swedish Wire (Katthammarsvik, Sweden), August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The small far-right Sweden Democrats party said Monday a second media outlet had refused to air its anti-immigration ad campaign, insisting it was being censored and Swedish democracy was in danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That media representatives in this way would take on the role as censors and filter the message voters receive before the election is nothing less than a threat to democracy,&#8221; Sweden Democrat chief Jimmie Ã…kesson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The party, which according to recent polls could enter parliament for the first time after upcoming September 19 elections, complained last week that private broadcaster TV4 had refused to air its advert and said Monday private radio station SBS had also backed out of a deal to broadcast a radio version.</p>
<p>The television advert shows a race between an elderly woman and several women in burqas pushing prams with a slogan promising to safeguard pension funding at the expense of immigration.</p>
<p>The radio version meanwhile featured the same ad&rsquo;s slogan, a female voice telling voters that &#8220;on September 19, you can choose between hitting the breaks on immigration instead of hitting the breaks on pensions. Vote for the Sweden Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>SBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but on Friday TV4 told AFP it had decided not to broadcast the advert because it considered it breached Swedish laws prohibiting messages containing hate grounded on race and religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case it is against religion,&#8221; TV4 communications director Gunnar Gidefeldt said.</p>
<p>Sweden Democrat spokesman Erik Almquist rejected the idea that the ad campaign was illegal, and said the party was working on a new advert with a similar theme that it expected TV4 to broadcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be ridiculous if they were to say the new film was illegal, so we expect it to go through,&#8221; he told AFP.</p>
<p>According to a survey published Sunday, the Sweden Democrats were polling at 4.6 percent of the vote, enough to enter parliament.</p>
<p>If they manage to pass the 4.0-percent threshold for the first time, political analysts believe the party could be in a powerful position with the two main blocs on course to split the vote.<br/>

		<p>I agree that democracy in Sweden is in danger.  But it has been in danger for very long time.  Sweden punted on democracy when it embraced diversity.  Democracy or diversity, but not both.</p>

<p>So being &#8220;anti-immigration&#8221; is all it takes to be labelled &#8220;far-right&#8221; these days?  Swedish democracy <i>is</i> in danger   &mdash;   but not from the &#8220;far right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in the Fifties and Sixties, Sweden could always be counted upon to lead the European Marxist mob in denouncing the &#8220;Racism&#8221; of the wicked White Americans.  I&rsquo;d like to believe that they&rsquo;ve learned something since then, but I doubt it.  How the Vikings must weep with shame as they look down from Valhalla upon their spineless descendants!<br/>

		<p>Years ago, Gunnar Myrdal, a Swede wrote a book about America&rsquo;s race problem titled &#8220;An American Dilemma.&#8221; Well, now they have a Swedish Dilemma. What goes around comes around!</p>

<p>Incredibly Blaak, the Nordics are among the weakest in terms of racial identity among all of the European peoples.  I don&rsquo;t blame them too much however.  They are the quintessential &#8220;Blond-haired, blue-eyed&#8221; Whites that our media and theirs have targeted and demonized.  As a matter of fact in Minnesota, the Whites there - and many of them have Nordic ancestry - feel the most racial guilt for being &#8220;too White&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s what I think part of the problem is in the Nordic countries.  They, of all the Whites, have had this sense of racial guilt inculcated in them by the forces that want to destroy Whites everywhere.  They have a little bit of luck in that they&rsquo;re so far north and the southern part of Europe is being invaded first, however their luck is going to run out eventually as our luck will unless we all wake up.</p>

<p>I found a website that lists the platform of the Sweden Democrats.  They seem to be a traditional, conservative political party (what today is called &#8220;far-right&#8221; by the leftist-controlled media).  For the most part their platform should appeal to anyone of a true rightist inclination.  Sadly, for decades now Swedes have been so thoroughly inculcated with the nonsense of Fabian Socialism I really don&rsquo;t believe this party will ever have broad appeal with such a debased people.</p>
<p>I believe it was J. Paul Getty who once said &#8220;If you want to be a success at something, watch what the winners do and do what they do.&#8221;  Though the Sweden Democrats may not ever rise to prominence, they can garner enough support to become &#8220;king-makers&#8221;.  The Lega Nord did this in Italy by concentrating their efforts in promoting the anti-immigrant and anti-multicultural aspects of their platform.  The Danish People&rsquo;s Party did something similar in Denmark.  If the leaders of the Sweden Democrats were wise, they would do likewise.<br/>

		<p>Well, I live in Minnesota and have all of my life, and I venture an opinion the white guilt referred to above is misleading. Many people here have little to no guilt; however the politics are &#8220;liberal&#8221; because the north of the state is heavily unionized and swings elections to the Democrats. The activists in the Dem party exploit this and try to implement &#8220;progressive&#8221; political reforms which have and will continue to succeed as long as the Midwest economy holds up. <br/>
People will always need to eat of course so the bedrock of Minnesota&rsquo;s economy, agriculture, is sound. However future  taxpayers are going to get less and less for more and more taxes because debt service, as a portion of tax, is growing exponentially. Whether or not any &#8220;liberal&#8221; high tax states will remain once the extent of debt service ( to China, primarily) really sinks in is very questionable. Minnesota is destined to be a low-service state just like the Southern ones we have been taught to look down on.</p>

		<p>Protecting Sweden doesn&rsquo;t begin and end with stopping muslim adherents from entering the country.  Swedes made the country what it is and only they can preserve it.  All these immigration issues go back to the Atlantic slave trade.  White people brought millions of sub-Sahara Africans to America and into white society.  Because of the influence of the United States on the whole world this pattern of bringing in large numbers of non-white people into white societies have been replicated everywhere.</p>

		<p>Is this political party getting their message out through alternatives to the media like youtube, facebook, and in other ways? There has to be alternatives to the MSM. Nobody ever admitted to voting for Jesse Helms, but he won several elections. The Sweden Democrats are free to take the &#8220;Hands&#8221; ad and tweak it to their audience. It may have been &#8220;rayciss&#8221;, but it was dead on. </p>
<p>&#8220;White prejudice and discrimination keep the Negro low in standards of living, health, education, manners and morals. This, in its turn, gives support to white prejudice. White prejudice and Negro standards thus mutually &lsquo;cause&rsquo; each other.&#8221; (An American Dilemma - Gunnar Myrdal). If you were alive, I would tell you to visit Detroit and Gary, Indiana and then see if this holds true. Predominantly Black cities that recieve more federal aid than you can imagine. Even with all of this, London probably looked better after the bombing campaigns of WWII than these cities. With these Muslims being the functional equivalent of low IQ blacks, let&rsquo;s see how long before Sweden wakes up to what is happening. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised more people from Amren don&rsquo;t &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>They actually believe that people from Sweden are so indoctrinated that they support their own displacement.  That they VOTE for it.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth and there is no democracy in Sweden or anyplace else for that matter.  The election is predetermined.</p>

		<p>the elites are terrified of the popular rage that is building against national suicide via immigration.</p>
<p>these ads should disseminated online with the tag &#8220;censored by the governent&#8221;.</p>
<p>they will be seen by as many people, an will have greater impact. </p>
<p>the entire population of scandinavia is miniscule compared to one tiny corner of china, india or africa. </p>
<p>most europeans want to end 3rd world immigration and deport foreign criminals and welfare cheats, and as soon as they elect governments committed to doing so, it will happen.</p>
<p>Europe is not doomed, just waking up much to late for simple solutions. </p>

<p>Two places:  the  British Isles  and Scandinavia enjoyed uniquely protected  locations in Europe, in that they were detached from the mainland, and thus from the great  migrations, invasions, and wars that periodically swept over  the continent.   (The Swiss and the Basques protected by their mountains, also preserved their own cultures and gene pools.)  That lucky fact of isolation  allowed them, over many centuries, to develop their distinctive populations and their unique, recessive gene pools  (ie. many blonds and redheads and noticeably fair complexions).    </p>
<p>Britain has experienced an invasion about once every thousand years  (as it is again today).  Sweden    has never known an invasion  by anyone,  hence they are not alert to such a danger.  It is not in their history, nor in their consciousness.     The Huns, the Mongols, the Celts, the Romans,  the Saracens,  the Turks,  -  even Napoleon  and  Hitler   &mdash;   never touched Sweden&rsquo;s shores.  Sweden has  also been a powerful  kingdom,  always accustomed to being in control, never in the inferior position. Thus, having no experience with conquest or invasion,  they have no fear of foreigners/invaders.  </p>
<p>They remind me of those  (now-extinct) birds on remote Pacific islands which never knew any predators. When predators were introduced, the birds were trusting and defenseless and allowed their eggs (and themselves) to be eaten without any resistance.  They didn&rsquo;t even fly away. They could not believe was what was happening. <br/>
 <br/>
This  insular sense of security    &mdash;  - both their isolation and the fact that they have both been powerful and have not had to fear invaders   &mdash;  -   makes these two populations (British &amp; Scandinavian) particularly vulnerable now to invaders.  Like those pacific birds, they naively regard these aggressive invaders as no more than interesting newcomers.   They have no idea that the newcomers about about to consume them.</p>

		<p>Sweden Democrats is a cultural conservative and paleo-conservative party. In an American political context, they would be classified as a party close to the cultural-conservative wing of the Republican Party. Sweden Democrats are great fans of the Spencer-Horowitz-Pipes Zionist-club and Robert Spencer even spoke this summer for the party. It is very similar to Danish Peoples Party, but has a more radical history. </p>
<p>Sweden Democrats were founded by some conservative Swedes in 1988. In 1991 the party became a platform for neo-Nazis which lasted until 1995 when Mikael Jansson took over as leader. All Nazis left the party or were forced to leave the party. </p>
<p>Mikael Jansson seeked to turn (SD) into a paleo-conservative and cultural nationalist party, even though many racialists were still in the party at high positions until 1999-2000. Jansson had first kicked out the neo-Nazis and now he wanted to get rid of all racialists. In 1999-2000, the &#8220;Stockholm section&#8221; was expelled from the party - and almost all racialists were forced to leave the party. But some stayed. </p>
<p>The racialists (ethno pluralist) created National Democrats in 2001, a party very similar to British National Party. They have a couple of seats in some municipalities around Stockholm. The Swedish Democrats have very few racialists in their lines today. Since 2005 the party leader is Jimmy Ã…kesson, he went even further to modernize the party. He was a part of the liberal Scania region and in opposition to the more hardliner Stockholm region. </p>
<p>Almost all of the remains of the &ldquo;racialist&rdquo; section left when he entered as party leader. Ã…kesson went further, today you are expelled if you raise the issue of race or talk ill about Israel.  Hence, the party wants to make all import of hall-Kosher meat illegal and the party wants a ban on circumcision of boys. The Jewish community is not very thrilled when it comes to Sweden Democrats, even though the party is heavily Zionist.</p>
<p>The problem in Swedish politics is that the elite have adopted cultural Marxism in the most extreme way. To even talk about the concept of assimilation is called &#8220;racism&#8221;. According to our elite, the Swedes should adopt the values of the immigrations not, the opposite.  Ten years ago it was racist to talk about language tests for those who seek citizenship. Today, the Peoples Party supports it, but no other party, except Swedish Democrats of course. You have to live here to understand it â€“ it maybe the most terrible political experience you can find.  In Sweden it is an official truth that gender is social constructed. The governments have the last 10-15 years have spent billions of kronor on different projects. The Swedish Army spent around 100 million kronor a year on Gender issues.  All the media is anti-assimilation and cultural Marxist in the most extreme sense. It is common among the elite (politicians, academia, media and so on) that there is no need for immigrants to learn the language. </p>
<p>We have also an American inspired anti-discrimination government department, and fill suits against both private companies and the state. Often the defend Muslim men&rsquo;s right to discriminate women, according to the director, &ldquo;ethnicity, religion and culture&rdquo; is more important to defend then gender. This in a country that spends billions a year on radical feminism and social constructive ideas on gender. </p>
<p>The election is in two weeks and the media is going in spin and the mainstream politicians are afraid. Experts say that Sweden Democrats will become the fourth or even third largest party in Sweden after this election. It would likely destroy any chances to have working government. There is a large risk that old enemies (Social democrats and social-liberal party and former conservative party Moderates) will create a government together. That would mean that end of a 100 year battle between them too. Socialism and Liberalism would at last join side against all nationalism and conservatism in Sweden. Sadly as it is, just 20-25 years ago both the social democrats and the Moderates would rather join with Sd then the other socialist-anarchist-social-liberal parties that are currently in the parliament along side the social democrats and the moderates. <br/>

		<p>14:  Reminds me so much of Jesse Helms&rsquo;s &#8220;Hands&#8221; ad from 1990, especially the end when both the Swedish retired woman and all the burqua-clad women are both jumping up trying to grab their hands onto the pull cords.</p>
<p>15 ghw:  My memory might be failing me here, but I recall that while Sweden has been free from invasion because of its favorable geography as you say, that the opposite isn&rsquo;t true   &mdash;   Sweden of course occupied Norway for a very long time, almost wiped the Norwegian language out of existence, and it also marched deep into central Europe at one point.</p>
