			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stewart Lawrence, Daily Caller (Washington, D.C.), September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One leading Tea Party group has decided to work closely with Roy Beck&rsquo;s Numbers USA, a well-known &#8220;restrictionist&#8221; lobby that wants to see immigration, both legal and illegal, reduced. Together these groups are opposing passage of the DREAM Act, the stand-alone legislation that immigration reform advocates have rallied around as the prospects for passing a broader immigration bill have faded.</p>
<p>However, two other key Tea Party groups, including FreedomWorks, whose co-founder, former House majority leader Dick Armey, supports expanded immigration, say they&rsquo;ll stay out of the fight over the DREAM Act.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But many Tea Party activists believe that restoring the &#8220;rule of law&#8221;  &mdash;  and regaining control of the country&rsquo;s borders  &mdash;  is also fundamental to the American ideal of freedom. They don&rsquo;t necessarily oppose rising immigration, especially legal immigration, but they are hostile to &#8220;amnesties&#8221; for illegal aliens that appear to reward &#8220;lawbreakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, anti-immigration Tea Partiers can cite the Founding Fathers in defense of their views. Ben Franklin spoke out frequently about the dangers of unregulated German immigration, which he felt would dilute the American &#8220;ideal&#8221;  &mdash;  much as nativists today oppose unrestricted Mexican immigration, fearing it will undermine mainstream culture, including English as the nation&rsquo;s primary language.</p>
<p>So far, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a consistent Tea Party view on immigration, and with no single national leader, the movement is under no pressure  &mdash;  at least not yet  &mdash;  to develop one. {snip}</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, a Tea Party Immigration Coalition (TPIC) formed in early July to oppose the city&rsquo;s policy of providing &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; to illegal aliens. The group reportedly included local trade unions and a key state legislator who supports legal immigration, but opposes illegal immigration on the grounds that it hurts unemployed Philadelphia workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In some locales, Tea Party leaders have broadly supported the Arizona crackdown and other expanded police enforcement measures but have drawn the line if the rights of legal residents and US citizens are threatened  &mdash;  as a recent federal court judge found when she blocked key provisions of the Arizona law.</p>
<p>And some Tea Party activists are staunchly opposed to the introduction of a national ID card as a way of weeding out illegal aliens from the workplace. {snip}<br>

<p>Really? Where did Ben Franklin say this?  No Germans? Why not?  If ole Ben said this then I will reconsider my thoughts about him. </p>
<p>They are of the White race and they are the cleanest, most civil and law-abiding citizens we have. Even though I am part German I have nothing but respect for the German people. I haven&rsquo;t bought into the propaganda being spewed by the commie leftists. </p>

		<p><i>Ben Franklin spoke out frequently about the dangers of unregulated German immigration, which he felt would dilute the American &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I hate to break his bubble, but a lot of subtle American folkways that American exceptionalists (especially on the doctrinaire right) find dear were German customs.  For instance, jury nullification used as a method to halt capricious legislation.  (Not the race-based type.)</p>
<p>Also, Ben Franklin hated Germans (in many ways), but he loved blacks and black slaves   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t remember reading any of his writings where he said that blacks were incompatiable with the &#8220;American ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>And some Tea Party activists are staunchly opposed to the introduction of a national ID card as a way of weeding out illegal aliens from the workplace.</i></p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re for open borders and amnesty.  I&rsquo;m against a forced national ID card (except in the case of my proposed voter fraud prevention reform, where state-issued voter ID cards, only to be used for voting purposes, would have to conform to certain standards.  But if you don&rsquo;t want to vote, you don&rsquo;t need the card&gt;).  And I&rsquo;m obviously against amnesty and open borders.  It&rsquo;s just that a forced national ID is a straw dog non-solution.</p>

		<p>The Tea Party also wants to include all races and welcomes it. They are behind all these blacks running for political office and support them vehemently. Of course they are &#8220;divided&#8221; over immigration&hellip;they just want the illegals to become &#8220;legal&#8221;. They don&rsquo;t care if our land is flooded with Mexicans, Africans or Arabs, as long as they appear non-racist.  Fools!</p>

		<p>To those anti-immigration Tea Partiers addressed in this article, let me say this in reference to the citation of Ben Franklin: I&rsquo;d prefer an &#8220;unregulated&#8221; German immigration one thousand+ times over a &#8220;legal&#8221; immigration of filthy and unassimilable Somalis, Pakistanis and other backward non-white immigrants from the third world who pose a substantial demographic and cultural threat. It is a shame that German immigrants are even compared with today&rsquo;s diverse pack with the same breath, regardless of whether they happen to be legal or not.</p>
<p>For me, this digression triggers the final disqualification of the Tea-Party from being ever considered as a serious and hopeful political force. It is too obvious that origin, culture, race and religion (among other things) are the primary factors for an immigrant&rsquo;s ability to contribute positively to the host country, not his legal status. Yet many Tea Partiers fail to see the truth. The ones who do are scared of being labeled as racist, which is why they use the legality-black/white status terms to portray their views as less offensive.</p>

		<p>From its very beginnings, the Tea Party has been mainly composed of dissatisfied Respectable Conservatives.  With them, the &#8220;Respectable&#8221; part always takes precedence over the &#8220;Conservative&#8221; part. </p>
<p> By the time the governmedia get through with them, the Tea Party will have accepted all the liberal shibboleths and become indistinguishable from the Republicans.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Ironically, anti-immigration Tea Partiers can cite the Founding Fathers in defense of their views.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically? More views of the Founding Fathers on immigration:</p>
<p>John Adams: &#8220;My opinion with respect to immigration is that except of useful mechanics and some particular description of men and professionals, there is no use of encouragement.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson in Notes on the State of Virginia discouraged building the future nation out of immigration: &#8220;It is for the happiness of those united in society to harmonize as much as possible &hellip;&#8221;  Immigration risked bringing in habits and outlooks rendering our polity &#8220;a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass.&#8221; </p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: &#8220;The opinion advanced in [Jefferson&rsquo;s] Notes on Virginia is undoubtedly correct &hellip; The influx of foreigners must &hellip; tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit &hellip; to introduce foreign propensities.&#8221; </p>
<p>James Madison wanted only &#8220;foreigners of merit and republican principles.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yet for all their doubts about immigration, the Founders never devised a selection process   &mdash;  - because levels were quite low. No records were kept until 1820, but rates in the first three decades of the American Republic are estimated at less than ten thousand per year. </p>

		<p>The truth is that the USA does NOT need more legal immigration. The only exceptions IMO are someone who marries a US citizen or someone who has some exceptional skills ie. a rocket scientist or someone opening a large company that will hire Americans. Other than that, no we have had more immigration in the past 40 years than all the years before combined and we do NOT need more people.</p>

<p>Mr. Armey&rsquo;s role is to corral Tea party members into the Republican camp. He&rsquo;s like a &#8216;facilitator&rsquo; in a discussion group; he makes you believe you&rsquo;re making the decisions when in fact he&rsquo;s leading you to his conclusion.</p>

		<p>Any group that fronts as a bulwark against unconstitutional tyranny must oppose immigration, legal and illegal, as it now appears. The very culture that the original constitution was destigned to preserve, is on the verge of destruction by African, Asian and aboriginals from Latin America.</p>
<p>Slash the spending of the feds for sure. But this is for naught if we are forced to forego our European heritage.</p>
<p>If the courts have mangled the original constitution beyond repair, then we need a new constitution, without a 14th, 15th or First Amendment. Europeans with traditional values do not need a First Amendment to respect each others speech or spiritual beliefs. But all men are not created equal, and Jefferson has consigned us to hell unless we strip our civic philosophy of his armchair dreams.</p>

<p>These are not &#8220;tea party&#8221; activists.  They are old guard GOP attempting to infiltrate a new guard republican takeover of the party to keep themselves from being booted out of power.  Largely, they have failed.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, republicans up for election this year are strongly anti-immigrant.  NumbersUSA is mentioned in the article.  Not mentioned is the dramatic success this group has had in changing the makeup in Congress of pro vs anti-immigration lawmakers.  Basically, this november, the dam breaks and a flood of anti-immigration advocates take over.</p>
<p>Expect big changes shortly afterward.</p>

		<p>I hate to see Armey involved in the Tea Party in any way. His history is one of advocating for open borders and unlimited immigation. Armey strikes me as wanting to re-cycle himself into relevency, just like Newt Gingrich is trying to do. I&rsquo;ve never like or trusted Armey and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one. </p>

		<p>The tea party is a proto-party.  It is stunted by it&rsquo;s narrow definition of itself, and by it&rsquo;s fear of the usual accusations meant to stifle real discussion, and by it&rsquo;s lack of leadership.  When it fails, as it must, or when it is truly co-opted by the RINOS, folks will launch a REAL third party, with a REAL agenda, and a REAL leader who can galvanize the new party enough to laugh in the face of PC thuggery, lies, and mischaracterizations.  I hope.  If the tea party proto party serves to at least make the RINOS and Liberals nervous and back off some until the REAL thing comes along, great.</p>

		<p>I think conservatives that support increased immigration really haven&rsquo;t given much thought to the consequences of that policy on their way of life. They likely hold superficial views about America being a &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221; and mouth a popular mantra that many have come to believe is the American way. I&rsquo;ve never met any logical non-liberal that still wants more immigrants once explained in detail the tremendous burden increased immigration will put on this nation. I think there&rsquo;s much more education on this issue needed by the majority of Americans.</p>

		<p>Franklin&rsquo;s views on restricting immigration were in his &#8220;Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind&#8221;, from 1753.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that some people&rsquo;s feelings may be wounded by his skepticism about German immigration, remember that to bring in large numbers of German immigrants would bring linguistic problems as well as religious problems; many Germans were Catholic, whereas the predominant Anglo-American culture was Protestant. The religious conflicts which brought the Puritan colonists to this continent were not a distant memory back in the 1700s when Franklin wrote. Regardless of anybody&rsquo;s personal feelings, I think it was sensible to try to keep homogeneity and to preserve the original colonial-stock people. <br>
And isn&rsquo;t the disregard for the existing people of this country, and the introduction of too much &#8221;diversity&#8221; a big part of today&rsquo;s crisis?</p>

		<p>One of the problems of current immigration is past immigration. The descendants of immigrants get their nose out of joint at the mention Ben Franklin opposed German immigration. So what? Things were different 200 years and it made sense to oppose German immigration. I support Ben Franklin&rsquo;s view. And you know what? I support it today! I don&rsquo;t want any more immigrants regardless of who they are. And that includes GERMANS! What&rsquo;s more, I would support Germany if it had a ban on immigration that included Americans. Immigration undermines the culture and community even when those immigrants are white. That&rsquo;s one of the things that caused our problems today. We had so many European immigrants in the early 1900s that it undermined our unity.</p>
<p>PS- I&rsquo;m married to an immigrant. But I&rsquo;m not a hypocrite. I&rsquo;m not going to say European immigration is good just because it serves my personal interests when I know it doesn&rsquo;t serve our national interests.</p>

		<p>I disagree with most comments here. Most TPers are strongly, if inchoately, against mass immigration, legal or illegal. They do not like our &#8216;changing&rsquo; country. However, they are mostly animated by fear of galloping socialism, and they recognize, as all realists must, that the US is rapidly (if unfortunately) darkening, and that if we are to have some kind of civilize future, we had better damn well bring some minorities into the camp of supporting private property. It is not inconsistent to oppose non-white immigration, while supporting overtures from conservatives to minorities (though without any dilution of conservative principle). And that is the correct course of action, even for white preservationists.</p>

		<p>Franklin&rsquo;s opinions cited here come from his 1751 article entitled <i>&#8216;Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, &c;&rsquo;</i>. </p>
<p>As far as he addresses immigration in the article, he argues against the immigration Pennsylvania had been experiencing at that time from non-English immigrants. &#8220;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens,&#8221;</p>
<p>He also writes this: &#8220;Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. <br>
&hellip;<br>
And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? &#8220;<br>

		<p>To be charitable, the Tea Party is composed of badly educated naive,well-meaning people cocerned about government that costs a lot and produces little. While many Tea Partyites may have attended colleges, they are not deep thinkers; their dependence in many cases on Glenn Beck for historical and philosophical perspective is pathetic.</p>
<p>Ethnic resotration is essential to American restoration. The immigration and civil rights laws of the sixties passed within two years of each other. That was no coincidence. It was a planned destruction of the US as a culture defined by traditional white protestant values. </p>
<p>Is it possible for conservative European-origin Jews and Catholics to assimilate into that culture? Of course. Many did before and after 1965. But the prevalence of multiculturism is now championed by the dominant liberals of Jewish, Catholic and WASP religions and cultures. The Education System and its reforms are targeted to the success of &#8220;minorities&#8221; as mediocrity becomes the goal for white students.</p>
<p>South Asians, many legal immigrants, dominate the medical and high tech professions.</p>
<p> The Tea Party is clueless about all this, as is their Beck Guru.</p>

		<p>I would like to say that every time I hear one of these weak kneed, spineless, race-whipped, white-guilt-ridden Tea Party people spouting the same old self-hating, Cultural Marxist induced brainwashing garbage about &#8216;diversity&rsquo; being a great strength, when any white human with a brain bigger than a peanut and an IQ over single digits ought to be able to clearly understand that &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is merely a code word invented by the enemies of White European people to mean &#8216;anti-white&rsquo; - I want to throw up.   Wake Up, people -  these are the words of our mortal enemies who intend to cloak their genocide plans for the White race under this insane language.</p>
<p>News Flash to these Tea Party dullards:   Diversity spells white genocide and the more diversity our enemies can impose upon the White majority, the less political power whites have and the less culturally stabile our nation gets and the less cohesive our society becomes. Face the truth:  Multicultural societies do not work, have never worked, and our enemies understand this - and they are using this forced multiculturalism to create a climate that will allow them to create a totalitarian, oppressive system of government that will rival the evils of the old USSR under Bolshevik Communism.   The same thing is being pushed throughout the entire White West, and it is Cultural Marxism driving it in every European nation.  </p>
<p>Whites are clearly in the cross-hairs of these Cultural Marxist Communists - and unless we snap out of our brainwashing funk and see diversity as a deadly form of white genocide and a critical weapon in the war against the White West - the famous words of the hard core communist Nikita Khrushchev about the Communists taking over America without a shot being fired will become a reality.   But, do not take my word for it.  Use the Web, look up the words and predictions of Lenin and Stalin and the other communists - they knew full well that &#8216;race&rsquo; would be the greatest weapon in the Communist arsenal to destroy the West and these poorly educated and ill-informed, Tea Party people are playing right into the enemies hands by pushing this &#8216;diversity&rsquo; poison.  Why do you think the Communists were so tight with the likes of M.L. King, Jr?  He was one of their weapons against the White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant ruling establishment, people!  </p>
<p>Stop apologizing for being white!   Loyalty to one&rsquo;s own race has to become the #1 priority for all whites, worldwide!</p>

		<p>Remember that the ranks of the Union army in the War Between The States were largely made up of Irish and German immigrants, some who enlisted right on the docks.  Members of the Prussian military elite achieved very high rank in the Union army.  </p>
<p>Without this constant source of fresh troops it&rsquo;s likely the Union would have been forced to sue for peace at some point, as contrary to popular opinion today, most Northerners soured on the war very quickly as it became obvious it wouldn&rsquo;t be over in a matter of months, as promised.  </p>
<p>These immigrants brought with them the socialist ideas that were budding in Europe at the time and would be first brought to light under Bismarck after the unification of Germany, which became the first modern welfare state.  </p>
<p>These new &#8220;Americans&#8221; played a very strong role in the death of the Constitution in the 1860s and subsequent rise of the American Empire, the 11 Confederate states being the first occupied territory of that empire.  To the Germans, Irish, and many others, it felt just like home.</p>

<p>One of the problems of current immigration is past immigration. The descendants of immigrants get their nose out of joint at the mention Ben Franklin opposed German immigration. So what? Things were different 200 years and it made sense to oppose German immigration. I support Ben Franklin&rsquo;s view. And you know what? I support it today! I don&rsquo;t want any more immigrants regardless of who they are. And that includes GERMANS! What&rsquo;s more, I would support Germany if it had a ban on immigration that included Americans. Immigration undermines the culture and community even when those immigrants are white. That&rsquo;s one of the things that caused our problems today. We had so many European immigrants in the early 1900s that it undermined our unity.</p>
<p>PS- I&rsquo;m married to an immigrant. But I&rsquo;m not a hypocrite. I&rsquo;m not going to say European immigration is good just because it serves my personal interests when I know it doesn&rsquo;t serve our national interests.<br>

<p>Sounds like you have a hatred for Germans.  As for your contention that EUROPEAN immigration undermined our unity, I say hogwash!  AMERICA was founded for those of the Caucasian RACE! What are Germans and all those White people who you denounce? They are not of the White race? </p>
<p>As for your contention that that &#8220;we&#8221; only want to serve our &#8220;personal interests makes me laugh. I care ONLY about the WHITE race and it&rsquo;s survival in a sea of the blacks and browns the world over.  Now I consider that in our NATIONAL interest, don&rsquo;t you? </p>
<p> Also your argument that this is what caused our problems of today, another flat out lie. NON white immigration is what is causing most of our problems today!  As for you marrying am &#8220;immigrant&#8221; you did not state where the immigrant was from or what color? </p>
<p>As I stated before Germans here are decent, law abiding, clean and have much more character and morals than many of those you claim should be the only ones allowed in America. </p>

<p>What?  German immigrants in the 18th Century were fairly evenly divided between Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist.  So a majority were Protestant, so worries about &#8220;Protestantism&#8221; were invalid because German immigrants couldn&rsquo;t have possibly turned the Protestant-Catholic balance to Catholic.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Racist:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it on this medium many times before, and I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to say it again.  The only reason we think of German-Americans fighting for the Union side is because modern-day G-A societies are peddling that myth to assuage Hitler guilt.   While far many more G-As fought on the Union side, the rule of thumb for G-As was that you fought for the side where you lived.  G-As south of the M-D fought for the Confederacy, north for the Union.  It&rsquo;s just that there were so many more north than south.</p>
<p>Robert E. Lee was fond of his G-A soldiers.  I&rsquo;ve read a litho of a letter he wrote after the war to one of his underlings, recommending that he find as many G-As as possible to take over unfarmed land, because they made great farmers.</p>
<p>What is right about what the modern day G-A societies say is that almost all G-As were opposed to slavery, even ones in the South.  NOT because they loved blacks, but because they despised them, and thought that black slavery was an inefficient farming method.  However, the largest antebellum cotton farm in Texas was G-A owned and operated, and used black slaves, so it wasn&rsquo;t universal.  Ironically, the G-A societies of today tout that one of them own and maintain an anti-slavery monument in Texas, supposedly the only anti-slavery monument south of the M-D Line.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
From its very beginnings, the Tea Party has been mainly composed of dissatisfied Respectable Conservatives. With them, the &ldquo;Respectable&rdquo; part always takes precedence over the &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; part. </p>
<p>By the time the governmedia get through with them, the Tea Party will have accepted all the liberal shibboleths and become indistinguishable from the Republicans.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I see things the other way around.  Not &#8216;what part of his/her soul must a person sell to be part of the political process&rsquo; but rather &#8216;What would happen if 60-70% of the white working class in key states formed a secessionist coalition and simply pulled out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1861 there was the slave issue and the instigation of punitive taxes as well as the Yankee march southwards.  Today, there is a CIS of former Soviet States and memories of Hitler.  </p>
<p>With the possibility of takeover of local nuclear facilities to make people THINK before moving to immediate action.</p>
<p>But even so, how much could the U.S. &#8216;afford to lose&rsquo; to a white nationalist/separatist subnation before they had to defacto admit that the expert worker and taxbase population hit was just too great?</p>
<p>And could we succeed in bartering a protectorate or territory status (i.e. food and money) if such an effort was deemed essential before the national armed forces were stood up or brought home and reversed any sudden declarative gains with overwhelming force?</p>
<p>In this, I look upon the war in SWA as a practice ground for suppressing a 2nd American Civil War where &#8216;casualties don&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;, because it&rsquo;s white on white racist and internally suppressed data besides.</p>
<p>But if politics are so hopelessly mired in corruptive influences and leadership cowardism in forming and stating a single, unifying, party ethic that basically amounts to: &#8220;America belongs to the Whites just like Africa is Black and East Asia is Golden&hellip;.&#8221;, then I don&rsquo;t see much hope for any but the alternative: &#8220;Or else!&#8221;</p>
<p>And I seriously want to know how much of America could let go before the hit on the remainder (as raised taxes and defaulting balance of payments) would force a military resolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that La Raza wants the West and Southwest.  Asian influence in the NW and North is pretty extensive.  Blacks dominate in the East with a rising percentage of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Are we looking at this the wrong way?  Are we looking at a state of unstoppable fragmentation that should be -encouraged- so that White Americans can eek out a section of the middle nation breadbasket as our own while the government fights fires elsewhere?</p>
<p>If I was going to go for a bipartisan/multi-racial &#8216;coalition approach&rsquo; that would pretty much be my route.  Not what we can wrest back but how much we can save as well as _how honest_ we can be about it in terms of the number of whites allowed in on the secret and allowed into the new territory, after the separation.  We may end up burning more of our own bridges than anyone else&rsquo;.</p>

<p> <i>&#8220;Despite the fact that some people&rsquo;s feelings may be wounded by [Franklin&rsquo;s] skepticism about German immigration, remember that  large numbers of German immigrants would bring linguistic problems as well as religious problems; many Germans were Catholic, whereas the predominant Anglo-American culture was Protestant. <b>The religious conflicts which brought the Puritan colonists to this continent were not a distant memory </b>back in the 1700s when Franklin wrote.

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Although my sentiments are pro-German, I fully agree with VA (and with Franklin). It is regrettable that Franklin&rsquo;s views may seem biased today, but there were good reasons for them <i>at that time. </i> One must try to see it through his eyes. Germany was also considered a backward country then; even the Germans  in the 1700s had little respect for their own language or culture and tried to emulate the French.  Consider too that England had a new king, a German, a bully of an autocrat who was highly unpopular in the colonies and who could not speak English (nor even bothered to learn). And, since Germans had grown to such a large number in Pennsylvania, they were indeed a threat to linguistic unity and to the cohesiveness of the populace. They also were often members of unassimilable sects. (Indeed, some groups   &mdash;   the Amish, Mennonites, Moravians   &mdash;   are still speaking German today.)</p>
<p>And remember that American colonists then could not possibly have immagined such madness as bringing in Bangla Deshis, Tamils, Yemenites, Ethiopians, Rwandans, Sudanese, Sikhs, and Somalis. That was unthinkable when those people were as far as the moon. To their minds, Germans were about as foreign and exotic as you could get.  And they didn&rsquo;t want this divisive influence, whatever it was.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; had not yet been manufactured and promoted into the great virtue that it is today. People back then, unbrainwashed and  left to their own natural wisdom,  didn&rsquo;t worship Diversity and didn&rsquo;t want it.</p>

<p>You have missed the point completely! Franklin was not talking about race at all, he was concerned about preserving cultural and linguistic unity. Of course, Germans are white (which was no big thing then),  but to him, this was not a &#8220;racial&#8221; issue.</p>

		<p>Benjamin Franklin should not be attacked for his remarks about German immigrants.  In fact, although I am one-fourth German, I probably would have agreed with him if I had lived in the late 1700&rsquo;s.  He wished America to remain a predominantly Anglo-Saxon land, and if that meant keeping Germans out, then so be it.  Of course, now we know that Germans are a hard-working, respectable, easily-assimilated (well, after the antebellum period at least) group of immigrants, and they are currently the largest single ethnic group in the United States, making up a plurality or majority in more than half of our counties (mostly rural ones, albeit), and around a fourth of all white Americans.  Remember, also, that in Ben&rsquo;s day, we didn&rsquo;t have to worry so much about non-white immigration (in fact, I have heard non-whites weren&rsquo;t even allowed to immigrate here at that time), and so they could focus on being even more specific when it comes to immigrant origins.</p>

		<p>So Question Diversity is obviously German.  I noticed you left out the Irish entirely.  You also haven&rsquo;t disproven anything I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reason we think of German-Americans fighting for the Union side is because modern-day G-A societies are peddling that myth to assuage Hitler guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the very next sentence reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;While far many more G-As fought on the Union side&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could it be that we think of these folks fighting on the Union side in larger numbers is because they actually did so, and not because of some exercise at soul-redemption by modern day German Americans?  Not everything is a conspiracy.  Also, I&rsquo;d imagine that ALL ethnic white groups in America fought for whichever side of the Mason Dixon they happened to live on, not just Germans.</p>
<p>I always look forward to your posts every day, but I must disagree with you here.  During this period in history Germany herself was roiled in conflict.  Remember this was scarcely 20-30 years before the unification of Germany.  Many German immigrants surely brought this sentiment of a strong central state to our shores with them.  These immigrants were far more accepting of the shenanigans of Lincoln and the Radical Republicans than the native population, because it felt like home to them.  Come on folks this is EXACTLY why we take issue with immigrants today.  Because they don&rsquo;t understand our traditions and therefore don&rsquo;t flinch when they get trampled.  It hastens the death of our freedoms.  And it was no different back then.  </p>
<p>None of this is meant to disparage Germans in any way.  Some of my people were called &#8220;von Beckman&#8221; when they first came here.  But pointing out that the Germans who lived in the South when the war started fought for the Confederacy doesn&rsquo;t discount what I&rsquo;ve said and reiterated here again.  </p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re wondering, I&rsquo;m a really mixed mutt in terms of ancestry   &mdash;   German, Irish, English, Russian, Jewish, Czech, Polish and Italian.  The German comes through the most, to look at me.</p>
<p>As for your rebuttal, you seem to miss my point.  Most G-As (a lot of them weren&rsquo;t recent immigrants at the time of the WBTS, the much-heralded &#8220;Forty Niners&#8221; you mention, they were in what would and did become the United States for several generations) fought for the Union side, because most G-As lived in Union states.  BUT&hellip;the point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that modern day G-A societies are blowing smoke up where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine when they peddle propaganda that G-A WBTS soldiers were exclusively Union, and fought exclusively for the sake of anti-slavery piety.  My point was to untangle that mythology.</p>
<p>As for the Irish, especially Irish immigrants who came over because Ireland was still reeling from the famine   &mdash;   they got the worst end of the deal in the WBTS.  Promises of redistributed land, but what they got in reality was shoved into U.S.eless Grant&rsquo;s meat grinder, and their children got chained to sweatshop machinery so that the owner could make big profits and funnel some of them to anti-slavery do gooders.  The NYC Draft Riot was Irish-American frustration with Yankee elitist hypocrisy far more than anything else.</p>
