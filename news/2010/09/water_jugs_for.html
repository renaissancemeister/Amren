			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Fischer, Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Human-rights activists can&rsquo;t be charged with littering for leaving bottles of water for migrants on federal property, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>In a split decision, the majority said there is no question that Daniel Millis put sealed gallon bottles of purified water on trails in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge southwest of Tucson.</p>
<p>But Judge Sidney Thomas said Millis was charged under a section of law that makes it illegal to dispose of &#8220;garbage&#8221; in any wildlife refuge. And he said that term is sufficiently ambiguous so that it might not include the water bottles.</p>
<p>Thomas said that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily give Millis and others the legal go-ahead to put out the bottles without fear of future prosecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis likely could have been charged under a different regulatory section, such as abandonment of property or failure to obtain a special-use permit,&#8221; the judge wrote. &#8220;However, that is not the question presented here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dissenting Judge Jay Bybee, said his colleagues were torturing the language.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving plastic bottles in a wildlife refuge is littering under any ordinary, common meaning of the word,&#8221; Bybee wrote.</p>
<p>Millis is a volunteer with No More Deaths. In 2008 he admitted to federal Fish and Wildlife officers that other volunteers he was driving around had been leaving filled water bottles and picking up empties.</p>

		<p>Yes, he should be charged with several crimes&hellip;.</p>
<p>At a minimum, with conspiracy and as a ascessory to a felony, aiding and abetting in the commission of a felony, and RICO.</p>
<p>Better yet, and maybe we can do this later, call it treason and colaboration with the invader. Giving aid and comfort to the enemy is the normal definition.<br/>

		<p>If we call this what it is, aiding and abetting an invasion, what we have here is TREASON.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the law specifically but understand there are strict requirements for a treason charge, multiple witnesses or something to that effect, but still&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>According to Judge Thomas&rsquo; legal gymnastics, this doesn&rsquo;t NECESSARILY give these &#8220;human rights activists&#8221; (I think the term &#8220;enemy agents&#8221; better describes these folks) permission to continue.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;necessarily&#8221;?  It either does or does not, Judge Thomas.  Too many of these judges never stopped being lawyers&hellip;. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ok though, because Thomas goes on to outline what these folks need to do in order to legally assist in illegal activity.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Millis likely could have been charged under a different regulatory section, such as abandonment of property or failure to obtain a special-use permit&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So now all the No More America organization has to do is obtain a special-use permit next time they want to use federal lands to enable an invasion.  Then it&rsquo;ll be OK. </p>

		<p>I actually agree with this.  It is total nonsense to attempt to put a stop to this behavior with charges of &#8220;littering&#8221;.  Instead, call it what it is&hellip;..treason and conspiracy to commit murder, drug trafficking, human trafficking, rape, robbery and murder, identity theft etc.</p>
<p>In other words, indict these people as accomplices to whatever crimes these illegals commit and give them sentences that reflect the severity of what they are responsible for.  They deserve decades of prison time, some, life in prison or execution (just like a driver of a getaway car for a gang that murders a bunch of people while robbing a bank)&hellip;..not a $20 fine.</p>
<p>And if that is a little over the top, go after them with RICO.  Seize all of their assets and prosecute them like any other organized group whose purpose is to commit crime.</p>

		<p>If another man walked behind Mr Millis poking holes in the bottles, no laws would be broken.  After all, he would only be altering litter or abandoned property - you can&rsquo;t vandalize owner-less garbage.  </p>
<p>But I guarantee the Feds would find some way to charge the bottle-poker with a civil rights violation, reckless endangerment, attempted bodily assault or some inappropriate charge.  The multiculties will always warp laws for their purposes.  </p>

		<p>Why stop with just water?  Why not food, condoms and maps? Why not give them a ride? Why not help them transport the mules and their drugs? Why not meet them at the border so they don&rsquo;t have to cross the desert? Better yet just send the money to Mexico so they can buy an airline ticket and fly here.</p>
<p>Next time I get stopped for littering I&rsquo;ll just tell the officer, &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t littering, I was being compassionate and leaving things out to help the illegals,&#8221; never mind the fact that I live a thousand miles from the border.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from a desert water-placer named Ray Askins:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;they can be three days in the desert in the weltering heat with no shade. It is the American dream (the lure) that forces the undocumented immigrants to risk their lives in the desert.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/39zbtdr</p>
<p>Get that?  We allegedly FORCED the illegals to invade our country.  </p>
<p>Does anyone think a statement like that is truly motivated by empathy for thirsty Mexicans?  He clearly hates America - the illegal alien lovers want to destroy this country.   </p>

<p><i>We found water bottles intact at the next station, perhaps undetected by would-be vandals.  But at others, where no water remained, belongings apparently left behind by immigrants suggested a trail of torment.</i></p>
<p><i>A woman&rsquo;s high-heeled shoe lay clearly visible on the hot sand.  &ldquo;Some have crossed in cocktail gowns,&rdquo; Morones said, adding that women desperate to be reunited with husbands or family members in the U.S. are often uninformed &mdash; and intentionally misled by smugglers &mdash; about harsh conditions.  </i></p>
<p><br/>
I&rsquo;ll bet Mr. Morones thinks that&rsquo;s America&rsquo;s fault for not just opening all borders stations and screaming, &#8220;Free Citizenship - Just Step Inside!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Look, it says the guy was &#8220;leaving filled water bottles and picking up empties.&#8221;  If he wasn&rsquo;t picking up all of the empties, that&rsquo;s littering.  I know I don&rsquo;t have the whole story  &mdash;  if they found even one empty, yeah charge him with littering, or abandonment of property.  If not, let him go about his ignorant business.  He should have been charged with aiding and abetting criminals and criminal acts.  This &#8220;littering&#8221; business is nonsense.  Charge him with a real crime or don&rsquo;t charge him at all.</p>

		<p>To numbers 1 and 2.  Agree completely.  That is the actual violation.  </p>
<p>To number 11 (and by extension numbers 1 and 2).  The FACT that the charges discussed were NOT aiding and abetting is a tacit admission that our federal government and our judges consider the illegal invasion NOT A CRIME OF ITSELF.<br/>
This was federal property, thus federal laws (or the fed&rsquo;s interpretation of federal law) was in operation.  Since Obama and the feds and the power mongers and federally appointed judges see an illegal invasion as not illegal - and everybody pretty much recognizes that now - an attempt was made to use federal laws that ARE enforced on federal property by the feds.  It, of course, failed.  I guess the judge ruling on this figures the illegals will &#8220;pack out their trash&#8221; like good citizens in national parks and refuges are supposed to do, right?  Yeah.  Right.</p>

<p>This statement actually - accidentally - makes a little sense, Jill.  To a Mexican, the United States&rsquo; prosperity is what might be called an &#8220;attractive nuisance&#8221;, much like a backyard swimming pool.  This is why municipalities have laws requiring property owners to enclose their pools with fences; so children don&rsquo;t stray in (tresspass) and drown.  Pressing the analogy farther, this is why the United States needs a cleared border zone with walls, razor wire, patrol roads, and land mines.  An attractive nuisance - like a swimming pool or a developed country - needs to be secured, for everyone&rsquo;s good.</p>
