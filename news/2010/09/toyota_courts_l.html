<h1>Toyota Courts Latinos With Free Hispanic Pride Stickers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toyota Motor Corp. {snip} is offering drivers a series of stickers that celebrates their Hispanic heritage.</p>
<p>The decals contain the phrase &#8220;somos muchos,&#8221; or &#8220;we are many,&#8221; followed by cultures, regions and popular descriptors from all over Latin America, such as &#8220;somos muchos Mexicanos&#8221; and &#8220;somos muchos Hondurenos.&#8221; The decals, designed to be stuck on bumpers or windows, come in more than 100 different versions and are available in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Toyota is offering the stickers free on the Spanish-language version of its Facebook page. {snip}</p>
<p>Toyota is the top brand among Hispanic buyers in the U.S., according to vehicle registration data gathered by R.L. Polk and Associates. The automaker says it has held that title since 2004.</p>

		<p>Will Toyota also be offering stickers to <i>White</i> buyers, to celebrate our <i>White</i> heritage?  As I recall, Toyotas are pretty popular among White people, too.  Maybe it&rsquo;s time for that to change.</p>
<p>I watch a lot of Japanese TV shows, and in them, amerikans are always depicted as either blonde Whites or studious, intelligent, important-looking blacks.  I recall one particularly laughable show, in which an amerikan &#8220;black&#8221; was represented by a Japanese man in dark makeup and wearing a wooly wig. Mind you, this was no comedy   &mdash;   they presumed that their target audience wouldn&rsquo;t notice the difference.</p>
<p>They seem to have the idea that the population of the US is at least 50% black, a distortion they must surely get from our own TV and films.  </p>
<p>Apparently, mestizos have now been added to that list.  How the Japanese must look with disdain and disgust upon this mongrelized country!<br>

		<p>I certainly have a hard time believing that data. There are so many hispanics where I live and I most certainly do NOT see them driving Toyotas! I own a Camry and this obvious pandering by Toyota to hispanics sickens me!  I will go to the dealer and demand a White Pride sticker! When they tell me they don&rsquo;t have those, then I will ask why not? More Whites buy Toyota than do these &#8220;hispanics&#8221; and my eyes do not deceive me, so when did they become so PC that they had to pander and appease a so-called minority group in this country.</p>

		<p>As a retired new car dealer who sold out just before the crash, I have to wonder what US Toyota management is thinking, or perhaps smoking.  </p>
<p>With two thirds of the country (all non-Hispanics) wildly upset about illegal immigration, most of it involving Hispanics, they&rsquo;re making a loud point of &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to the Hispanic community, huge numbers of whom are in fact illegals?</p>
<p>They may be number one with Hispanics, but they&rsquo;re acting as though they&rsquo;re trying to upset the great majority of native-born<br>
Americans.  Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve always felt that Honda, Nissan, and Mazda all made much neater and more interesting cars than Toyota anyway.</p>

		<p>East Asian businesses gain footholds in America, Canada and Europe by initially courting low income non-white populations with less expensive products.  Thirty years ago it was rare to see a black motorcyclist but now not so much because East Asian motorcycle businesses set up shop in or near black areas.  Mitsubishi Bank, which is apart of the Japanese conglomerate that owns Mitsubishi Motors, already has hundreds of locations in California.  Toyota sells more cars in America than any other company and expect other East Asian car companies to expand.</p>

<p><br>
That is not even close to how the japanese look at us.  More in line with reality is barely contained fetishism, worship or extreme anger (rare among the young).</p>
<p>To be extremely blunt, a white man, who visits japan can expect large numbers of japanese women to sleep with him in the single bars scene for no other reason than he is white.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is it is very, very unlikely that any girlfriend, will actually marry you (or even do anything but keep your relationship a close secret).  As I said&hellip;..fetishism.  They have a distorted, view of us that is 2 parts inferiority complex and one part racism.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s terrible that Toyota is giving legitimacy to organizations such as La Raza.  But it doesn&rsquo;t sound like they&rsquo;re giving out &#8220;Hispanic Pride&#8221; stickers so much as &#8220;Mexican Pride&#8221;, or &#8220;Honduras Pride&#8221; etc.  The equivalent would be stickers that say &#8220;Italian Pride&#8221; or &#8220;German Pride&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is true that they are &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to the Hispanic population and not to the white population - but as long as whites do not look at themselves, in America, as a people with a distinct ethnic identity, can we really blame the Japanese for ignoring those same whites?  Let us lay the blame at the feet of whites who ignore their own heritage.  As soon as whites start taking pride in their own race, then others will relate to us with due respect.  Until then, respect is not due.</p>

<p>They likely got a lecture from some Hispanic advocacy group or individual who told them wild stories about the &#8216;growing Hispanic market&rsquo; and how they needed to seize the opportunity to appeal to Hispanics before another auto maker did.</p>

<p>I only have two thoughts concerning this. First, they may be #1 with hispanics but this won&rsquo;t help their sales with whites. Not that it matters. I haven&rsquo;t driven a Toyota in over 20 years. But I do have two Fords sitting in the driveway. </p>
<p>Second, one would have to be a fool to put a bumper sticker like that on their car. Who wants to shell out that kind of money just to have it keyed? And I say this after having driven around a majority black city for years with a confederate battle flag vanity plate. But I had the plate on an old beater. I would have never put it on my good car.</p>

<p>The idea behind presenting mostly non-Whites as Americans is to condition our minds with imagery.  In my bank, which is a large bank, there are murals on the walls and photo advertisements.  Most of these photos and murals present Whites in a far lower percentage than their percentage in the population.  They also depict a very low number of WHITE MALES.  That&rsquo;s another commonality.  This is true virtually everywhere you look today.  Go to websites of companies.  Look at the percentage of non-Whites to Whites.  Notice how prominently the non-Whites are depicted in the imagery.  Notice that in more and more instances Whites are portrayed as subordinate, older - the young ones being the non-Whites, Black males being &#8220;strategically placed&#8221; usually near blond-haired White females, with both leaning in the direction of each other, White women with their children with no sign of a father anywhere.  Here&rsquo;s a real sign of the times, I went into Macy&rsquo;s a few weeks ago.  An advertisement depicted a hostile-looking Black male with a child whose skin was light brown.  He had the kid in his hands and he was staring into the camera with that typical arrogant Black male facial expression.  The implication in the advertisement was that the child&rsquo;s mother was apparently a White woman.  The look on his face was one of -</p>
<p> - I&rsquo;M TAKIN&rsquo; YO WOMAN WHITE BOY, AND DERE AIN&rsquo;T NUTHIN U CAN DOO ABOUT IT.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this was an ADVERTISEMENT FOR CLOTHING.  In other words this entire scenario was ARRANGED BY THE ADVERTISERS TO APPEAR THIS WAY.  There are literally thousands of images everywhere that view along these lines.  Their purpose is to condition our minds as White people to acquiesce to Black and non-White dominance.  </p>
<p>It is extremely important for White people to begin to notice this on a CONSCIOUS LEVEL, so that we realize just how insidious this media conditioning process is.</p>

		<p>I think Toyota&rsquo;s profits have been going down. They are no doubt looking to tap into any available markets. I would not buy a Toyota. They are manufacturing cheap cars with cheap electric steering nowadays. They don&rsquo;t even drive like real cars. I will repeat myself don&rsquo;t buy a Toyota.</p>

		<p>No. 11 - Awakened.  You are totally correct.  Here in Britain it is the same -  almost impossible to see a poster, group photo in the  press,  T.V. commercial, government leaflet, etc. without a multicultural mix.  Subliminal brainwashing of the masses -  &#8216;your culture is being destroyed but you will not even notice&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>Has anyone seen The Regence Group&rsquo;s Heroes of the Latino community marketing campaign? More and more companies are jumping on to this so-called emerging Latino market. The problem is, the white American market is and always has been much larger and a greater economic driver. Catering to the Latino market is basically saying &#8216;white Americans are no longer a relevant priority even though they contribute the most to our organization.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Heroes of the Latino community - what an insult to Americans. There is only one community in this country - the American community. Could they be any more blatantly anti-American? I definitely will never look at Regence for my insurance.  </p>
<p>What we need in this country are more nationalists starting up 501(c)3 foundations that cater exclusively to whites and the American community. We need to develop some seriously viable opposition to the organizations that cater to these minority groups. We need stipulations like &#8216;organizations with diversity or multiculturalism as a part of their mission or strategic plan are not eligible to apply&rsquo; or &#8216;organizations with board members with anti-American affiliations will not be funded&rsquo;. This will create political pressure on organizations like Toyota and Regence that will get them to seriously reconsider ignoring their most important market: white Americans. </p>

<p>This has been the strategy of the left for quite some time.But the reason white people accept this is because not too long ago everything was white. Remember the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, even the 70&rsquo;s. Whites are so full of guilt today that they are willingly allowing nonwhites to dominate so as to make up for the &#8220;injustice&#8221; carried out by those whites who were proud enough to portray itself in its media. These lost whites don&rsquo;t mind because they foresee a society in which we all will be mongrolized. Of course it will blow up into their faces when this country become disunited rather than mongrolized. Every ethnic group and race will carve out their little territory and live happily ever after. Why? Because they will get tired fighting each other. That&rsquo;s how the situation will play itself out. Believe me, America will not be another Brazil. </p>

		<p>Poster #11 is so right, and I wish there was more awareness of this out there.  The advertisements we see are basically an advance vanguard of the race replacement that we are currently undergoing.  Here are some things I noticed recently.</p>
<p>1.  In a teacher magazine recently, they had five types of students and how to reach them.  The smart student was portrayed by an inquisitive white girl.  The distrustful student was a black boy whose facial expression was one of: &#8220;I have been wronged and you must make it up to me.&#8221;  There was also a hispanic girl for the fun student and an asian girl for something else.  Guess what the blond white boy got - the troubled boy.  He was a 6-7 year old kid dressed to look like a punk-thug with a mean look on his face like he gets in fights all the time.</p>
<p>2.  The 2010 Kaplan catalog sent to urban schools has - get this - not ONE white person in it at all.  Everyone, even the teachers, are brown or black.</p>
<p>3.  I got a Macy&rsquo;s flier/catalog yesterday.  In the section on kids clothes (ages 5-10), there on the left page all the white kids were paired up with orientals.  (It was boy/girl in each of the five instances signalling future marriages.)  On the right page every kid was black or latino.  In the teenage clothes section, there was one mixed race boy (black/white with a fro) and all the rest of the kids were non-white.  In the women&rsquo;s clothes section there was only one white girl and she was very ugly.  In the men&rsquo;s clothes section there was only one odd looking white guy - all the rest were black or other.</p>
<p>4.  On the side of a bus I saw the other day for a health care insurer, there was a pic with maybe 8-10 people on it.  There was an asian lady doctor joyfully attending to a happy older black couple.  There was a black doctor attending to some latinos, and a crowd of people in the middle of every race you can imagine - all of them non-white.</p>
<p>On the face of it, these examples really do mirror the reality in cities today, but it just struck me that this shift occurred in my lifetime.  When I was growing up in the 70s and 80s everyone was white with an odd non-white here and there.  Now the opposite is the reality all over the land.  Wow.</p>

		<p>#11: For years I&rsquo;ve refused to shop anywhere the employees don&rsquo;t speak English or they have rap music playing. Recently, I complained to Champion Clothing (by phone) about it&rsquo;s web page having a black male with a White female. A few months later it&rsquo;s changed&hellip;not sure it was my call that had any effect. My next move is at my local Sears  &mdash;  going to tell the management they need to get more White images in the store or I won&rsquo;t shop there anymore. Even better: I&rsquo;ll make a $1,000 purchase, suddenly &#8220;notice&#8221; all the non-White images as I&rsquo;m paying, then cancel my purchase saying that until they get more White images, I won&rsquo;t shop there. Oh, and as a sidenote, I just bought a Toyota.  </p>

		<p>I noted comment 14 about &#8220;Hereoes of the Latino Community&#8221;.  A very good friend of mine is a first-generation American of Mexican heritage. Brown as a berry and jet-black hair.  Also quite successful as a teacher.  He said &#8220;why heroes of the LATINO community?  I was born here; I am American.  This is nothing but benign segregation and I want no part of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for La Raza and other such TRULY racist organizations, I will not do business with companies that contribute to them.  Yes, often it IS extortion, but these companies have a choice. Knuckle under, or do what Cypress Semiconductor did when Jesse Jackson brought his rent-a-riot gang to the silicon valley years ago. Kick them right down the front steps of corporate headquarters.</p>
