			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>D.S. Woodfill, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), September 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The widow of slain border rancher Robert Krentz has multiple injuries after police say a drunk driver struck her while she crossed the street outside her Douglas church</p>
<p>Marcus Gonzalez, a Douglas Police Department spokesman, said Ramon Saucedo, 66, struck Sue Krentz and Shirley Gregory as they crossed the street about 6 p.m. Saturday outside St. Luke&rsquo;s Catholic Church, 1211 E. 15th St.</p>
<p>Police booked him into jail on suspicion of DUI, endangerment and aggravated assault, Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>Sue Krentz was married to Robert Krentz, a 58-year-old rancher who was found shot to death on March 27 near Douglas. There were no immediate suspects, but authorities believed he had been shot by an illegal immigrant. The slaying became a national news story and increased furor over border violence.</p>

		<p>The Krenz Genocide. Barely enough to wake us up.  If it really was making a difference, Arizona would have called a State Convention to investigate the Federal employees who fail to protect Whites from the third world invasion.   </p>
<p>Until Whites recover the Va. and Ky. Resolutions, and learn how to incorporate John C. Calhoun into our pantheon, we should expect nothing but more permitted genocide.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t the White synagogues doing more to reach out to the undocumented immigrant community for inclusion in the life of the synagogue community?</p>
<p>Are they afraid of offending the White Episcopalians who have cornered the market on Inclusive Tolerance?</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this was a deliberate attempt on this woman&rsquo;s life. The attention her husband&rsquo;s murder focused on the illegal and enemy invaders killing our people is awakening more whites every day to the brown menace facing us.</p>

		<p>Here we go again. Another homicidal Hispanic DWI. I know whites drink too much when driving too. </p>
<p>But Mexicans and Central Americans really have developed a talent for killing others when driving drunk, which is usually the case when they drive. </p>
<p>I wonder how many times Ramon has been in a DWI or DUI situation? Does he have a license? Is he a citizen? Does he care? Why am I asking these stupid questions? And what will happen to him?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet I know.</p>

		<p>Mexicans cannot drive period!  Drunk or sober. Almost all the hit and runs in our city is by Mexicans. Most accidents are caused by Mexicans. Most drunk drivers are Mexicans. Legal or illegal, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>Does anyone remember what happened around ten years ago when Canada declared a moratorium on the bow season for black bear? A certain celebrity musician who had his own sports talk show in Detroit called for a boycott on Canada that made the big boy Canook politicians cry and quickly reconsider the matter.</p>
<p>That same musician speaks out a lot about the security of our Southern border, but like most people, that&rsquo;s all he does.</p>
<p>Such a man could promote a wild pig hunt in the border region of Arizona that could possibly bring tens of thousands of heavily armed, four-wheeling patriots to the troubled region for a week of camping, hunting and wheee-hawing. </p>
<p>I think Governor Brewer might even sign on for a chance to make the D.C. crowd break out their hemorrhoid pillows. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget on top of every other obvious problem many of these illegal immigrants have never owned a car before,  And so after mowing a few lawns they go out and buy a piece fo junk with no license, no insurance and no training. And did I mention that they can&rsquo;t read english road signs?  Then they go out and get a 12-pack of coronas to celebrate the fact that they now have a car for the first time in their lives. Eventually they plow into someone and there isn&rsquo;t a damn thing done about it. Why isn&rsquo;t MADD up in arms against this epidemic? HMMMM? I guess they care more about being part of the liberal mafia.</p>

<p>Odd that you had to add your last sentence. We tend to always have to follow up by saying, &#8220;Whites do it to&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I am also guilty of doing that and I decided I will never ever justify any thing I say about nonwhites to where I also have to add &#8220;Whites do it too&#8221;..that means when it comes to ANY crime! </p>
<p>Thing is, Whites do not have accidents, even while drinking, to the extent that nonwhites do. Not even close! I remember back in the 70&rsquo;s when I tended bar that was 99.9% White patrons,(what bliss!) and many drank too much, but over those years not ONE ever had an accident or caused an accident. It WAS the nonwhites and especially Mexicans that caused the accidents.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re not seeing the bigger picture.  It likely WAS a planned attack.  Both Times.</p>
<p>The Krentz ranch is juxtaposed with a gap in the Fence at the border.  Krentz died from a single Illegal, pretending distress, (i.e. _not_ a Coyote leading a troop of illegals or a drug mule, the only two kinds of people likely to be &#8216;legitimately&rsquo; armed).</p>
<p>Which is likely why he went to check on the guy.  That guy then got up and went home, -even though- he had just been acting hurt.  No.  Sorry, that dog don&rsquo;t hunt.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have this aged Mexican pull a &#8216;DWI&rsquo; attack on the widow, virtually guaranteeing that, if she ever did intend to stay, now she can&rsquo;t.  And the offender, being drunk, will not get attempted murder, but at most 5-7 for aggravated vehicular assault.  After which, I bet he or his kids are rich.</p>
<p>Stuff like this is a lot less random than it appears.  The only question is how much of it is deliberately ignored (and for what reason) by OUR government.</p>
<p>Because they are the ones who ultimately are responsible for the murder of Robert Krentz and the crippling of his wife, if the man/woman who did this was able to as a function of deliberate policy.</p>
<p>If that damn chink in the protection hadn&rsquo;t been there, Krentz would still be above ground and likely shoved his wife out of the way.</p>

		<p>Agree with #3.  I suspect this was deliberate.  I watch the subculture in CA and repeatedly see acts of vengance against white Americans. At work all it takes is a remark they do not like or just that you do not speak Spanish.  </p>

		<p>Florida has now become a major destination for mexicans.  While that would go unoticed in South Florida(really S. America), North Florida was the last resort of American citizens.  Well no more.  Along with the immigration comes the fact that our auto insurance rates are climbing to cover the increased illegal population that drives w/o insurance.  It was estimated that up to 50% of all drivers in S.Fl. are unlicensed and uninsured.  The numbers for N.Fl. while not as high are rapidly increasing.  </p>
<p>The Florida Highway Patrol and various sheriff&rsquo;s offices used to hold impromptu traffic stops.  But the ACLU and other rights activists decided that the traffic stops were too close to polling places so we lost that one in court.  The police just decided that they wouldn&rsquo;t fight it and now you see a traffic stop location is a rarity even though stats show random stops produce a large number of illegals, uninsured drivers and those with open warrants. </p>
