			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Branton, The Columbian (Vancouver, Washington), August 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Vancouver woman suffered severe burns Monday night when someone threw a caustic liquid in her face in an attack so unusual that a veteran police detective said he hadn&rsquo;t heard of such a thing in 30 years working in Vancouver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very bizarre, very random and very weird, and we don&rsquo;t understand it,&#8221; said Storro&rsquo;s mother, Nancy Neuwelt, reached by phone while at Storro&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 7:15 p.m. Monday, paramedics and police rushed to West Eighth and Columbia streets, near Esther Short Park. {snip}</p>
<p>Storro, a Vancouver resident like her mother, had been standing outside on the passenger side of her car, planning to get some coffee at the Starbucks there, Neuwelt said.</p>
<p>Neuwelt said Storro told her a woman whom Storro didn&rsquo;t recognize walked up to her and said, &#8220;Hey, pretty girl. How are you? Would you like a drink of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Storro, sensing something was wrong, declined the offer and the woman threw the liquid into her face.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Storro wore sunglasses that protected her eyes and she closed her eyes tight. She stooped down, Neuwelt said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Storro, screaming and in excruciating pain, &#8220;kind of remembers walking in circles,&#8221; Neuwelt said. &#8220;She felt like her heart stopped at one point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Storro ran and collapsed in pain. The bystander called 911 and also called Neuwelt, using Storro&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>Paramedics rushed Storro to the hospital and a Vancouver police officer spent several hours there to begin the investigation into the attack.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Detective Cpl. Wally Stefan with the police Major Crimes Unit took over the investigation.</p>
<p>Stefan said he had not heard of such a case here in 30 years with the Vancouver Police Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The assailant was described as a black woman between 25 and 35, who wore a green shirt and khaki shorts. She had medium-length black hair that was pulled back, said Stefan, who is hoping for more information from the public.</p>
<p>Neuwelt said her daughter is single, has no children and had recently moved to Vancouver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Neuwelt said it was unusual that Storro was wearing the sunglasses that protected her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She on a whim decided to buy a pair,&#8221; only about 20 minutes before the attack, Neuwelt said. &#8220;The weird thing is, she doesn&rsquo;t like to wear sunglasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she and her daughter believe God provided that help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Neuwelt said her daughter had never seen the assailant before, and it would be only speculation to try to explain a chemical attack she called &#8220;senseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens in the Middle East all the time,&#8221; the mother said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call detective Stefan at 360-487-7425.</p>

		<p>Good God! There are so many things to unpack in this story.</p>
<p>First of all, why is this woman and her mother so completely befuddled as to why this attack happened? Black women hate white women. That is the reason.</p>
<p>Second, if God was protecting her daughter, as the mother alleges, why was her daughter attacked in the first place? This argument is a little theologically misplaced.</p>
<p>Third, to state that acid attacks &#8220;happen all the time in the Middle East&#8221; is to confuse the issue. Vancouver is not the Middle East. </p>
<p>Why are white people so afraid to admit that blacks attack us because we are white? </p>

		<p>Correction:  The assliant should have be described as an African.  Stop using black for criminals and African American for esteemed, renowned, distinguished, historic first ever this or that African American.  Black criminals are &#8220;African.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they shouldn&rsquo;t have been shocked.  Africans committing henious violence is normal behavior for them.  I&rsquo;m shocked that the victim didn&rsquo;t know that.  </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, now I get it.  She&rsquo;s never read Hinton Rowan Helper&rsquo;s Africans in Africanland.</p>

		<p>I wonder if this was a black person (of the ghetto variety), or a Muslim from Pakistan.  Either way, it&rsquo;s a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, if ever there was one - except that attacks on whites don&rsquo;t count as hate crimes.</p>

		<p>In the 1960s or 1970s there were a string of acid attacks in NYC on Jews by blacks. </p>
<p>I know many black women are enraged that so many of their men go with non-black women. I am surprised there are not more of these race attacks on white (o, indeed, non-black) women.</p>

		<p>This happens occasionally in Pakistan, and it usually involves a man throwing acid in the face of a woman because she simply refuses to marry him. In other cases, a husband will sometimes throw acid in the face of his wife if he suspects infidelity. Either way, American women (and most other Western women) have no idea just how luck they really are, and that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t understand why they treat their men like dirt. It&rsquo;s also a reason why I abhor the &#8220;feminist&#8221; types.</p>

Vancouver WA. is pretty much about as far away as you can get from the racial situation in the U.S.? At least I would have thought so. A major point for border crossers. Surely there must be some film somewhere of the perp to catch the villain.</p>
<p>And if this is part of a national trend, someone needs to contact the FBI and get them involved. This could be interstate crime or civil rights violations.</p>
<p>OK, the Attorney General [ZANU-PF] does not think the civil rights laws in this country do not apply to whitey. But it is worth an effort at least for the investigative bureau to investigate. Use of acid in the face is grave bodily harm. A person in such an instance could use lethal force to defend themself.</p>
<p>Trace the nation wide trend back to the source. </p>

		<p>Nothing new here, blacks and arabs splash acid all over the place or generally behave cruelly.  I recall a handfull of stories over the past year where a black perp threw acid in someone&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, if one of these animals gets within striking distance, assume the worst and start swinging.  It could easly be a matter of life or death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happens in the Middle East all the time,&rdquo; the mother said.</p>
<p><br>
Yes it does, and that&rsquo;s deplorable. But at least when it happens in the Middle East it&rsquo;s for some sort of reason. That reason may be twisted and unfair   &mdash;   e.g. the victim is attacked by her own family members over some alleged dishonorable behavior or other   &mdash;   but Islamic acid attacks on women are not as completely random and senseless as this one in Washington State. </p>
<p>My sympathies go out to the victim and her family. Cosmetic surgeons can perform wonders these days, and I sincerely hope this acid-attackee can be a pretty white girl once again. </p>
<p>A pretty white girl who now knows the potential for depravity and sadism lurking within those cuddly African Americans the media are always foisting upon us. </p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t actually new to the United States. I heard of instances as far back as 1995 in New Jersey and New York.</p>
<p>Why is the lid lifting now? I&rsquo;m not sure. Partly I suspect because with the internet, local news is no longer strictly local. And that fact probably also increases the incidence of copycat crimes.</p>
<p>I hope the innovation diffusion curve saturates soon!</p>

<p>This could be a case of a psychiatrically disturbed person gone over the edge. It could be a race-hate crime, pure and simple.See Nola&rsquo;s excellent list of recent examples of acid crimes. Comment #5.</p>

		<p>Maybe a few of these acid wielders dying literally without a face because their intended victims shot their faces off would put a stop to this. This is grievous bodily harm, and that should entitle the target to legally kill acid throwers with gunshots. The woman who was splashed with acid was the target of a hate crime, nothing less.</p>

   I live near Vancouver and heard accounts of this attack on the radio.  No mention whatsoever of the race of the attacker or the victim.  No description of the attacker was given.  What WAS emphasized was that there was no known motive for the attack and that seemed to be a completely random crime.</p>

		<p>What is unspoken here is that Vancouver, WA is just across the river from Portland, OR.  Portland has had a black ghetto since WW2, when many blacks moved there to work in the factories supporting the war effort.  There are only about 35,000 blacks in Portland.  Historically Vancouver has been an all-white enclave.  </p>
<p>Now the political leadership, which is very based around real-estate development, has started importing the lowest of the low black deadbeats from Portland to fill up the housing units with section 8 recipients.   The Vancouver Public Housing authority has created a bunch of mini-ghettos in what was until VERY recently a solid working class community. </p>
<p>This attack took place near the Section 8 installation, and there is no doubt that it&rsquo;s some useless welfare recipient who has perpetrated this acid attack. </p>

		<p>Handicapped by the low IQ of the main group, Blacks are not very inventive as a general rule. One of them heard about acid attacks in the middle east and tried it here in the US. This was all over the news, which is where the others got the idea. They realized that throwing acid in a woman&rsquo;s face is unutterably horrific for the White race to comprehend or defend against  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s why they do it. </p>

<p>It has nothing to do with &#8220;luck&#8221; but with the values a society decides to have and why should women be grateful because throwing acid in their faces is not allowed here, should men be grateful? As far as treating men like dirt, some women do and some men treat women like dirt, goes both ways.</p>

Last year a British model named Katie Piper was the victim of an acid attack.<br>
She overcame the attack and her face was fully restored by top plastic surgeons in London.<br>
Acid attacks are becoming a trend among black afrocentrists who take their inspiration from Muslims as a way to satisfy their urge to commit crime and inspire socialist totalitarianism.<br>
Whites must take precautions because big govenrment has merged black populations into areas where whites live and work setting up a trojan horse situation for black hate crime.<br>
Consider carrying concealed.</p>

<p>In response to your request for analysis of this phenomenon, I offer a post I wrote for my blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://glpiggy.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/acid-attacks-jealousy-and-race/" rel="nofollow">https://glpiggy.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/acid-attacks-jealousy-and-race/</a></p>
<p>5 recent Western world cases of acid attacks perpetuated by black attackers (including Katie Piper in the U.K.).  the sole reason for attacking someone with acid is to decrease their sexual market value.  this is why it is mostly relegated to parts of the world where female sexual market value is of utmost importance to the social fabric and why it is mostly young, pretty women who are attacked.  Mostly, men and elderly women aren&rsquo;t the victims here.  </p>
<p>A random attack occuring in America requires a slightly different analysis.  Jealousy and a desire to devalue the victim are still the primary motivations.  Bethany Storro was quoted to night as saying that her black attacker looked jealous and full of rage before the attack.  </p>
<p>Blacks randomly attacking whites is nothing new here in America, but this method certainly is, and it is specifically a result of black female jealousy towards the perception of white female beauty.  And even though I&rsquo;m not a woman, this seems frightening to me.  </p>
<p>Hope you enjoy my post.  Thanks.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think so Anonymous when an intended victim takes out an attacker while they are pulling out the container of acid. I&rsquo;m saying that should be answered with the same response as someone going for a gun or knife while rushing you. Do you have any idea the kind of damage concentrated acid can do? I&rsquo;ve dissolved metal, stone and organic matter with it. Concentrated sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acid can eat your face off literally, and if burned over a large area of the body, death can result. Of course you can&rsquo;t see if acid was splashed in your eyes, I know that first hand from an accident I had. That&rsquo;s why targets of these acid attacks should shoot attackers before they get blinded permanently!</p>

&#8220;In NY a few years ago a nut went around randomly jabbing people with a needle&hellip;there are kooks everywhere. I try to avoid crowds and I am particularly wary around blacks, they are prone to violence and have a seething hatred toward whites. If I sense a dangerous situation, I will defend myself proactively and decisively&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually Proud it was a group of young Black females and I use the term &#8220;females&#8221; rather than &#8220;girls&#8221; because the latter suggests a degree of femininity, a quality which these &#8220;untermensch&#8221;  are sorely lacking. The victims were mostly all White (there may have been some Asians).<br>
Similar incidents occurred in Philadelphia more recently, Surprising isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
 On the Today show this morning they were discussing the case in Vancouver and there was an interview with Bethany Storro and her parents. The poor girl&rsquo;s entire head was bandaged. As a child she had Meningitis which left her with impaired hearing so she speaks with that characteristic pronunciation. I only hope that her attacker meets with a horrible end. The victim of course wants to forgive her. God bless her.  She&rsquo;s a better human being than I am. My only goal would be her demise and preferably at my hands.<br>
There is some hope. They interviewed an FBI profiler who said that there could be four possible motives one of which was that it was a racially motivated hate crime given the Black on White component. I can honestly say that it was the first time that I have ever heard that uttered. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just too obvious to ignore. Emile Zola said that when the truth is hidden and buried underground, it will but grow and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts forth it will blow up everything in it&rsquo;s path. Perhaps we&rsquo;ve finally reached that point after 60 years of lies.</p>

		<p>Being Canadian residents, I don&rsquo;t think Ms. Storro or her mother are as well versed with black on white crime as we in America are. And you can lay the blame for this right on their&rsquo;s and our liberal media who refuse to broadcast such criminal incidents, let alone call them HATE CRIMES, WHICH THEY ARE. Having grown up in south Florida and experienced black on white violence first hand, I let NO ONE WALK UP TO ME when I&rsquo;m in a vulnerable position. Usually, verbally telling them to back off is enough.  On two occasions, they kept coming, so showing them I was armed stopped them in their tracks. One person stood around until I got out my phone and said I was calling the police, then he ran. Proof that their intentions were less than honorable. This article makes me feel vindicated. I feel very bad for Ms. Storro and I wish her a speedy recovery.</p>

<p>Legally, that puts YOU in a very bad spot. If you attack them before they have done anything to you, that makes YOU the attacker.  If somebody comes up to you, holding a container of coffee,  how do you know what they have in that container?  Maybe it&rsquo;s just coffee.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve shot a friendly person who meant you no harm.</p>

Sorry. That ends my sympathy for her right there.<br>
I am so tired of hearing this same thing from victim after victim. Do they never learn?<br>
But maybe that&rsquo;s the prerequisite for getting intereviewed on television (???)</p>
<p>And why would anyone think they are Canadians?  <br>

		<p>CORRECTION - Oops! I misread. This occured in Vancouver, Washington. The media here in south Florida are actually giving this air time. I&rsquo;m shocked but pleased they are. But of course they are NOT refering to it as a hate crime. That would be expecting too much.</p>

		<p>Nobody, and I mean nobody just accepts coffee from someone he doesn&rsquo;t know from Adam on the street besides waiters or waitresses at a restaurant. I&rsquo;ve been the target of violent attacks by blacks, I know what they do before they strike, and neither are other people. There are dead giveaways that anyone who is aware of what is going on and who is around him or her will not miss.</p>
