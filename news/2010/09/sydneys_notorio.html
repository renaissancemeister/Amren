			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bonnie Malkin, London Telegraph, September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sydney&rsquo;s notorious Aboriginal ghetto, The Block, is to be torn down and replaced with a $60m (Â£36m) redevelopment in an attempt to break the cycle of drug dealing, unemployment and endemic crime.</p>
<p>Synonymous with heroin abuse, violence and policies that were meant to improve the lives of Australia&rsquo;s Aborigines, but resolutely failed, The Block&rsquo;s crumbling houses will slowly be bricked up over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The strip&rsquo;s 74 residents have been handed eviction notices and ordered to find new accommodation by November 19, when the bulldozers are due to roll in.</p>
<p>The demolition will mark the end of a troubled era for the neighbourhood, which, with its decaying homes and graffiti-sprayed walls, is a far cry from the picturesque harbourside precincts more commonly associated with Australia&rsquo;s largest city.</p>
<p>Just two miles west of the city centre, The Block was set up in 1973 by Aboriginal activists with the backing of the Whitlam government.</p>
<p>The first urban land rights claim in Australia, it was a direct response to the widespread discrimination Aborigines experienced in the private rental market.</p>
<p>The project worked well initially, with the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC), which was set up to manage and develop The Block, employing several residents to maintain the buildings.</p>
<p>But in the mid-1970s government funding for the project dried up and the four streets that made up the precinct fell into disrepair. Then, in the nineties, drug dealers brought heroin into the community, making it a virtual no-go zone, even for police. In 2004, a 17-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed while trying to evade officers.</p>
<p>His death triggered race riots in Redfern, leaving 40 police officers injured and sealing The Block&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>Today, just 15 habitable properties remain on The Block. But while the project to redevelop the area has been in the pipeline for more than a decade, some locals have complained that they have not been consulted.</p>
<p>However, local Aboriginal leaders believe that knocking down the houses is the only way to rid the area of its reputation as a violent, drug-fuelled slum.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to clean out the crime  &mdash;  we want the evil spirit out of this community.&#8221; Mick Mundine, chief executive of the AHC, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether they like it or not, this (development) is going to happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of people will complain. They&rsquo;ve been here a long time but it&rsquo;s time for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In place of the dilapidated, ageing terrace houses, the AHC plans to build a 62-home development. The area will also be renamed The Pemulwuy Project, after a famous Aboriginal warrior.</p>
<p>Indigenous residents will be invited to return when construction is complete in 2013.<br>

<p>Indigenous! Meaning non-whitey. Invited to return. That is a recipe for disaster from the get-go. Why even build the &#8220;homes&#8221; that will be trashed and destroyed in a few years anyhow?</p>
<p>These do-gooder projects just NEVER seem to work anywhere. Those projects they built in Chicago years ago within a span of ten years were 50 % trashed and uninhabitable! Torn down now and for the better. The residents dispersed to a hundred or so locations.</p>

<p>Bricks don&rsquo;t buy or smoke dope   &mdash;   people do!</p>
<p>Spending a million or a billion Dollars or Pounds on new buildings will not change things one bit, if the same people are brought back.</p>

		<p>So basically the riff raff destroyed their own homes once they stopped getting paid to do the things white people do for free like clean up trash, make minor repairs etc.</p>
<p>As punishment they get all new homes provided to them free of charge to destroy all over again. </p>

		<p>I think that instead of rebuilding the block, have habitat for humanity come in and have the residents rebuild their own housing. I can assure you that if this were the case, they would not destroy what they would build with their own hands. In the process, they would learn work habits and construction skills that could lead to jobs. But again I agree that this is wishful thinking.</p>

		<p>Austrailia and the US&hellip;on different ends of the earth, and yet the parallels between them are astonishing. </p>
<p>A &#8220;notorious&#8221; ghetto to be torn down, ala Chicago&rsquo;s Cabrini Green &hellip; policies &#8220;that were meant to improve the lives&#8221; of what we call &#8220;the underclass&#8221; in the US have &#8220;resolutely failed&#8221; &hellip; the neighborhood is marked by &#8220;decaying homes and graffiti-sprayed walls&#8221; &hellip; the project was set up by &#8220;activists&#8221; who now blame the government for its failure &hellip; the project was a direct response to the &#8220;widespread discrimination&#8221; the people faced &hellip; drug dealers brought heroin into the community, making it &#8220;a virtual no-go zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Change a few words and it could be an article in any American paper describing what&rsquo;s going on in one of our own &#8220;inner cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parallels? In both cases they describe people who were transplanted from a society of their own creation into a society created by someone else.</p>

		<p>Okay I am amazed at how low class people all over the world, even in far flung places, exactley copy black ghetto culture from america.</p>
<p>Aboriginals wearing baggy pants, flashing gang signs and doing grafitti, mexican indians copying the whole gangsta rap lifestyle, north african arabs rapping and wearing baseball caps sideways - what is it with black created ghetto culture that EVERYONE around the world  adopts it organically?  Where I live there&rsquo;s a whole subculture of white, eastern european trash who are eminem wanna be&rsquo;s!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused.  Does the Australian overnment actully blame the area&rsquo;s problems on the BUILDINGS?! Even crazyliberals would never assert that its the houses&rsquo; fault. Of course we here at AmRen would suggest that it is due to the inhabitnts, but even a liberal would normally blame things like low education levels, the &#8220;cycle of poverty,&#8221; low education opporunities, etc.</p>
<p>Also I really hope they aren&rsquo;t tearing down a whole neighborhood of old, historic buildings that reallyu just need some renovation work. It said in the article that the neighborhood was founded in 1973, but I;m wondering if that just means tthat&rsquo;s the year the Aboriginals moved in (after all, just twomiles from the Sydney city center would probably be old Victorian housing).  </p>

		<p>Those Aborigines functioned amazingly well in their natural surroundings. Their extremely low IQ&rsquo;s never held them back a bit in the wild country where they evolved. The misguided fools who decided that it would be a good idea to try to assimilate such a people into Western Society would have shown far more kindness if they had just exterminated them. They turned a people who were magnificent in the own world into just another bunch of hood dwellers in ours. I feel as bad for the Aborigines as I do for the people who have to put up with them.<br>
They shouldn&rsquo;t build another future ghetto for them to turn into a war zone. They need to  try to get them closer to where they belong. </p>
<p>They should consider encouraging them to move onto reservations by promising them easy money, then let guys with Jersey accents run casinos for them. That seemed to improve the relationship between Natives and Whites in Minnesota. The Red Man was easier to respect when the White Man knew he had money in his pocket that didn&rsquo;t come from a welfare check, and the White Man was harder to hate when the Red Man had to think of him as a potential customer. <br>
I feel that the descendants of vanquished indigenous people deserve far more consideration than do the ungrateful descendants of former slaves whose lives are golden compared to their counterparts whose forefathers managed to evade the slavers.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Block&#8221; is actually on prime real estate. It&rsquo;s close to many charming, older style terraces, it&rsquo;s a short walk to Sydney University and it&rsquo;s surrounded by trendy cafes, pubs and restaurants. It&rsquo;s even on the main rail line, just one stop from Sydney Central Station.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s no reason for it to fail &hellip;unless you consider the demography of the place.</p>

		<p>Crystal #4, your premise truly is wishful thinking, as you conceded.  People whose average IQ is even below black Africans (at about 60) probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to even follow instructions to build a house.  And most have no sense of responsibility or pride  &mdash;  as white people understand it  &mdash;  in their accomplshments.  <br>
Many housing projects in the U.S. appear to have been built to regionally contain blacks.  That apparently worked for a while, but now the ghetto dwellers are ranging out, driving significant distances even, to attack whites.  People are not truly safe in any neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Despite good intentions, Aussies have done more harm than good in trying to drag what are basically a stone-age people feet-first into the 21st century. Aborigines will never integrate successfully into modern Aussie society so they should be left to fend for themselves in the Outback as they have done for the past 40,000 years, with minimal intervention from Whites. The efforts of well-meaning blokes are futile in this case, as in many others.</p>

		<p>Civilization exerts different population pressures than a paleolithic or neolithic existence.  Intelligence is rewarded.  Violent inclinations result in incarceration, or execution. <br>
 <br>
As a rule, the longer a people has practiced civilization, the lower its crime rate will be, and the higher its average IQ.<br>
 <br>
I say &#8220;as a rule,&#8221; because civilization began in Egypt and what is now Iraq six thousand years ago.  The average IQ in Egypt is 83.  The average IQ in Iraq is 87.  In the United States the average IQ is 98.  The influx of Arab conquers in Egypt and Iraq, which did not happen until the seventh century, may have lowered the averages.  <br>
 <br>
In Egypt the murder rate is 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants.  In Iraq it is 6.7% per 100,000 inhabitants, but Iraq is at war.  When Iraq was at peace, the murder rate may have been much lower.  In the United States the murder rate is 5.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. <br>

		<p>As previous posters have said, it&rsquo;s always the people, not the buildings.</p>
<p>Just outside the City of London is the Barbican - a large, 1960s designed high density estate with brooding architecture, dark passageways and people living on top of each other in small apartments. I used to walk through it regularly to get to the Barbican concert hall and survived. Why? Because it&rsquo;s occupied by law abiding white people who don&rsquo;t expect someone else to subsidise their rent. In some respects it&rsquo;s an awful place - typical 1960s brutalism - but it&rsquo;s clean and there&rsquo;s no graffiti, litter or threatening behaviour.</p>

		<p>From what I understand when public housing was first built in the Black communities, a background check was done and the adults of the family had to be working. Then the mission changed to help the poorest of the poor. This means that single mothers on welfare with their children moved in and the previous tenants found that they were able to buy homes in better neighborhoods and moved out. This is when the drug dealers and their ilk moved in. Fortunately, in the new mixed housing complexes that have been built over the demolished public housing units, former public residents have to be able to pass a credit check, a background check, a criminal background check, and be employed in a real job. As a result, the majority of the former residents were not be able to return to their former residences.</p>

		<p>Cant wait for this new development to be finished and for its new <br>
residents to move in and tear it apart again</p>
<p> Ã remember many years ago where our well meaning Aussie  govt would build these brand new houses in outback country towns and then find our `original inhabitabts`moving in and and quickly demolishing these houses <br>
and in some cases literally using them for firewood</p>
<p>It appears nothing much has changed but of course no politician<br>
will criticize this waste of money&hellip;with a stone age culture<br>
and an IQ somewhere between 60 and 70 perhaps it wouldnt have <br>
been better to leave them to their original nomadic existence but of course we have to be seen as &#8220;helping them help themselves&#8220; even if we end up doing all the helping  for them</p>
<p>The problem now, like the States, is too many aboriginals(blacks) of mixed race,often much more white than they admit with a little<br>
education thanks to their white ancestry are making too many outrageous or impractical demands and no one dares to take them on for fear of being called racist or `not political correct<br>
 <br>
     In reality no decent Aussie in their  right mind would live near<br>
these hell holes with all the alcohol,drugs,crime and the myriad<br>
of other social problems they bring.As another post pointed out Redfern is close to Sydney CBD and is in a prime real estate area<br>
yet the Block is a `notorious Aboriginal ghetto.Wonder if the <br>
word `aboriginal` has anything to do with it    </p>
