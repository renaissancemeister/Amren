			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa W. Foderaro, New York Times, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than 35 years, the City University of New York, one of the nation&rsquo;s most diverse higher education systems, has quietly struggled with a minority group that says it has been passed over for jobs. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of all the universities and colleges that offer protections for minorities, CUNY appears to be the only one that has declared Italian-Americans an official affirmative action category in employment, promising special efforts to recruit, hire and promote them, according to national higher-education groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, for some who work in higher education, the notion of protections for Italian-Americans  &mdash;  at a university where 70 percent of the 262,000 full-time students are black, Latino or Asian  &mdash;  has prompted some head-scratching.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;After all, in New York we had an Italian-American governor, and we may have another one coming up&#8221; [said Ada Meloy, general counsel of the American Council on Education].</p>

<p> Okay, we just had a black president elected, and there in a black NY governer, so why do blacks need affirmative action still?  Let&rsquo;s turn it right back at them!</p>
<p>I do wonder about the italian call for affirmative action.  IN NY here, italians seem to be vastly over represented in an awful lot of places such as sanitation, trades, police, firemen, educational administration and in the local government of NYC.</p>
<p>Although if 70% of the students in the college are non-white, it does seem that whites in general have a case for affirmative action!  Turn it right back at &#8216;em!</p>

		<p>Who cares? CUNY and its multitude of PC-named schools is an affrimative action high school pretending to be a college. Little or no quality published research in the sciences is done there; the social sciences are simply apologists for the racism is all school  and the humanities have collapsed under the weight of Puerto Rican and other such important cultural studies.</p>
<p>This school was once arguably the best public college in America. That was during the Depression and right after WWII. Yes there were immigrants there: many Jews, Italians or Irish who couldn&rsquo;t go to Ivies because of money or discrimination problems. Oh yes, Racism against non-WASP whites. It happened, though the NAACP nor the aristocrat/Liberal FDR ever did anything about it.</p>
<p>After Kennedy and Johnson destroyed higher education in the 60&rsquo;s, the Fed Office of Education began affirmative action to throw out qualified whites, and CUNY yielded to black demands for open admissions. The Jews and white ethnics chose real colleges and the rubble was left to illiterate &#8220;Third World&#8221; high school grads who couldn&rsquo;t speak or write either English or Spanish. </p>
<p>CUNY died a long time ago. But the stupid taxpayers of NY as well as federal taxpayers continue to pump billions into this waste of time.<br>

<p>Absolutely. I often wonder how the term &#8220;Latino/a&#8221; (Spanish for Latin) came to represent people who speak Spanish.</p>

<p>We Italians are not &#8220;Latinos&#8221;.  We don&rsquo;t fit this so-called 21st Century definition of &#8220;Latino&#8221; in any way, shape or form.  I think &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are exclusively defined as Hispanic.  We&rsquo;re Americans of European descent.  As a matter of fact I&rsquo;m more than happy to be referred to as &#8220;White&#8221;.  We are White.  You better wake up buddy.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that maybe the Italians of the NYC area asking for affirmative action is a step in the right direction.  Maybe it&rsquo;s time that &#8220;ethnic whites&#8221; be recognized.  Of late, there seem to be a lot of parody-esque, walking Italian stereotypes promoted by the media    &mdash;   think &#8220;Real Housewives of New Jersey&#8221; and characters like Snookie. Might these portrayals be attempts to shame and discredit yet another white culture? </p>
<p>I have known many Italian people who are NOT &#8220;Jersey trash&#8221; or anything of the sort.  They are intelligent, family-oriented, and attractive Americans of Southern European descent. Italy contributed immeasurably to the Renaissance.  It has given us breathtaking art.  The cuisine is lovely. </p>
<p>I stand behind Italians in white solidarity.</p>

		<p>Just wanted to say a few words about CUNY. I graduated with a B.S. in Biology in 1981 from City College which is part of the CUNY system. The Sciences and Engineering Schools were excellent. Of course, it&rsquo;s hard to dumb down science and math because 2+2 always equals 4 no matter how much one might wish it weren&rsquo;t so. </p>
<p>However, what I really want to talk about is open admissions versus the old system. I got into City College just under the line before open admissions went into effect. </p>
<p>The old system worked like this. There were matriculated and non-matriculated students. If, for example, you wanted to take a course in Greek Mythology just because you liked it and you weren&rsquo;t working toward a degree, you were a non-matric. At that time in the 1970&rsquo;s you would pay $35 per credit which for a 3 credit course would be $105. If you were matriculated, you didn&rsquo;t pay anything per course except for for a general fee which you paid each semester. </p>
<p>I started college when I was in my 30&rsquo;s and here&rsquo;s the beauty of the old system. If you wanted to get a degree but had dropped out of high school for some reason or, as in my case, had been out of school for a long time, you could start out as a non-matriculated student. If you completed 16 credits with a 3.0 average or 32 credits with a 2.0 average you were eligible to matriculate. Of course, you had to pay for your courses as a non-matric, but they were dirt cheap. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame they did away with that old system. All you had to do was show that you were willing to study and pay a small amount of money and you could get into college and go on to pursue a degree. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.    </p>

<p>   <br>
I wouldn&rsquo;t call Italian Americans Latinos but Latin&rsquo;s. I would generally include the indigneous French and Spanish in that Latin category. These are the primary areas of the old Roman Empire and some of us can trace our ancestry back to that time period. Part of my family was from a Roman settled area of Southern France. </p>
<p>Other than speaking a Latin (Romance) Language, I think Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Colombians (who are usually of mixed race) don&rsquo;t share as much history, culture and ethnicity in common as white European descended &#8220;Latins&#8221;: Italians, French and Spanish. </p>

		<p>To Italian American @ 5:</p>
<p>Pace, Fratello. Cid Campeador was just pointing out the irony of how the term &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; has come to apply solely to Spanish-speaking folks from Central and South America while ignoring the descendants of the original &ldquo;Latins,&rdquo;   &mdash;  -viz., Romans.<br>
 <br>
In fact, linguistically speaking, Spanish-speakers from the Americas   &mdash;  - especially those of so-called indigenous lineage   &mdash;  - should have no more claim on the Latino tag line than Italians, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanians, Catalans, and a few other European groups   &mdash;  - who exuberantly speak these Neo-Latin or &#8220;Romance&#8221; languages. I guess the current hubbub derives from the southern American continent being designated as &ldquo;Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Italians as a people can sometimes be an acquired taste I say that as one), there is NO question of their utter Europeanness. No one from the Continent would ever think otherwise. Even after the Romans, Italians often led the way in art, music, literature, architecture,technology, exploration, fashion, and so much more. It&rsquo;s been said they taught the rest of Europe to eat with a knife and fork.</p>
<p>And, yes, it&rsquo;s a shame about the stereotypes that most Americans see. Italians are an incredibly diverse people that encompass so much more than Jersey &ldquo;hitters&rdquo; and mustachioed accordion players.<br>
