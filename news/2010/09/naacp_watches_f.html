<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>NAACP leaders have a message for the members of the tea party movement: We&rsquo;re watching you.</p>
<p>The civil rights group has partnered with three liberal media Web sites to form a &#8220;tea party tracker&#8221; intent on monitoring &#8220;racism and other forms of extremism&#8221; within the tea party movement.</p>
<p>The online project, which was developed and branded by the NAACP&rsquo;s new media staff, has already drawn strong criticism from tea party supporters, who have said repeatedly that racism plays no role in their movement.</p>
<p>Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau, said the project was started because NAACP leaders kept hearing from its members that they were seeing racist signs, T-shirts and commentary coming from the tea party movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The site is set up to be utilized as a tool to track activities as they come up,&#8221; Shelton said. &#8220;It is in some ways consistent with the kind of tracking that has been done of other extremist entities. I do not want to suggest that the tea party is a hate group, but there are some disturbing elements within.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brendan Steinhauser, director of federal and state campaigns for Freedomworks  &mdash;  which supports many tea party groups  &mdash;  called the ongoing conversation about racism and the tea party frustrating.</p>
<p>Steinhauser said liberal groups don&rsquo;t hold themselves to as strict a standard. For example, he said, at antiwar rallies during the Bush administration there were signs showing communist decals and supporting communist leaders Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s such a different standard we&rsquo;re held to,&#8221; Steinhauser said. {snip}</p>
<p>The tea party tracker site is aggregating stories from Think Progress, Media Matters for America and New Left Media  &mdash;  which all promote liberal ideas, while criticizing conservatives and Republicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Faiz Shakir, editor in chief of Think Progress, said he was glad to support the NAACP&rsquo;s site because he has already been sending staff members out to conduct interviews at tea party events. NAACP staffers will cull from that reporting for its site  &mdash;  along with any information that comes from the NAACP&rsquo;s 2,200 chapters. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far the tracker site has posted links related to conservative commentator Glenn Beck&rsquo;s &#8220;restoring honor&#8221; rally last weekend, including a picture of a man wearing a T-shirt that reads: &#8220;Blacks own Slaves in Mauritania, Sudan, Niger and Haiti.&#8221; NAACP has also posted a slideshow of photos it says are of offensive signs displayed at tea party rallies.</p>
<p>Steinhauser said his biggest concern about the tracker site is that &#8220;a lot of the signs that are going to end up on this site are going to be from left-wing groups infiltrating these rallies. It&rsquo;s so clear that they are holding up signs to make us to look bad. It serves their purpose to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well who died and made you God?</p>
<p><i>The civil rights group has partnered with three liberal media Web sites to form a &ldquo;tea party tracker&rdquo; intent on monitoring &ldquo;racism and other forms of extremism&rdquo; within the tea party movement.</i></p>
<p>Two words:  Shirley Sherrod.  In spite of Breitbart&rsquo;s accidental truncation of that video at first, the fact still remains that the NAACP crowd cheered her own BEFORE she announced her supposed epiphany.  I, however, was glad that she sent a white man looking for help to a white bureaucrat   &mdash;   he actually got service that way.  Talk about a blessing not so disguised.</p>
<p>Also, the NAACP crowd complains about black holes, greeting cards, anti-K books, etc.  As James Edwards would say, &#8220;racism shmacism.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The tea party tracker site is aggregating stories from Think Progress, Media Matters for America and New Left Media &mdash; which all promote liberal ideas, while criticizing conservatives and Republicans.</i></p>
<p>S-O-R-O-S.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;.the NAACP&rsquo;s 2,200 chapters</i></p>
<p>Highly suspicious of that.  That would mean 44 per state on average.  I think it&rsquo;s closer to 2200 members.</p>

		<p>I was reading a blog from a non-conservative black man and even he stated that the NAACP has become the &#8220;oh them again&#8221; organization that nobody takes seriously.</p>
<p>And who really cares what they say?  They have cried wolf so long and loud that I wouldn&rsquo;t give any merit to their claims if they had photos of a K rally in their office building.</p>
<p>Besides, do they realize how pathetic it is to go after the tea party who are really little more than race appeasers with a fetish for Thomas Jefferson?  It will certainly only bear negative fruit for them.  In fact I hope the NAACP pours it on so that these people will wake up to reality.</p>

		<p>Well, Krissah Thompson, I have disappointing news for you and the rest of the <i>Washington Post</i> comrades:  The Tea Party is anything <i>but</i> racist.</p>
<p>If it actually <i>were </i>racist, I&rsquo;d have some respect for it.</p>
<p>How about if we form an &#8220;NAACP Tracker project,&#8221; to keep tabs on &#8220;racism and other forms of extremism&#8221; in the NAACP?<br>

		<p>I viewed the NAACP&rsquo;s Tea Party Tracker Photostream and saw a photo of a man holding a sign saying, &#8220;Pay your own mortgage.&#8221;  Can you believe that anyone would be so mean and hateful as to hold up a sign bearing such a message?  Only a radical, right-wing, neo-militia, patriot, xenophobic, racist, anti-government extremist could possibly propagate such an evil, wicked, selfish message. </p>
<p>We are lucky that the NAACP has brought this clear cut example of Tea Party hate speech to our attention. </p>

<p>THAT&rsquo;S racist?!? Stating a simple fact - against slavery, mind you - is considered racist?! Blacks DO own slaves in some countries, so why exactly is it such a bad thing to state this simple fact? It certainly doesn&rsquo;t come anywhere near being &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prove it, seriously I WANT PROOF. Just because they say they saw something racist, doesn&rsquo;t make it so. Ignorant blacks get upset if you say &#8220;black hole&#8221;.</p>

		<p>What keeps getting lost here is something very basic:  exactly why AREN&rsquo;T more non-whites attending the tea party rallies?  Do they not care about government intrusion and confiscation?</p>
<p>The answer is that they SUPPORT those things, since they are the beneficiaries.  It&rsquo;s hard to be against taxes if you&rsquo;re a black person receiving redistribution dollars from whites.</p>
<p>So they won&rsquo;t rally behind common sense, but they&rsquo;ll spend their time hunting for (planted) signs in the crowd.<br>

		<p>Steinhauser&rsquo;s point is well taken - during the Bush years and all the hundreds of antiwar demos that took place, every sort of extreme left wing group was sure to show up and wave their banners and posters as high and as proudly as they could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find photographic evidence of what sort of groups regularly paraded around in public. The Revolutionary Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party, anarchist &#8220;black block&#8221; groups, extreme environmental groups and animal rights groups, anti-capitalist groups of every flavor, leftist ethnically and racially-oriented activist groups of every color.</p>
<p>Many of these groups advocated the weirdest stuff, including violent armed overthrow of the government. Many of these groups ACTUALLY did commit violent acts during their rallies and demonstrations.</p>
<p>And yet was the antiwar left subjected to the same level of scrutiny and hostility by the mainstream media because of the actions of the few extremists among the ranks of the antiwar movement? Of course not - largely because the mainstream media was opposed to the war too!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old tedious game of guilt by association. The NAACP has the right to play that game, of course, but at considerable risk to their credibility (if they have any left).</p>

How many of the alleged racist signs and racist t-shirts were waved and worn by provocateurs?</p>
<p>Anyone can show up at a rally with an extremist sign. There&rsquo;s no way to prove what their true affiliation or motivation is.</p>
<p>Until and unless they can produce the alleged racist, don&rsquo;t believe the accusation.</p>

<p>Well at least they didn&rsquo;t call it &#8216;cracker tracker&rsquo;, at least in public anyway. Not that it would make any difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blacks own Slaves in Mauritania, Sudan, Niger and Haiti.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They probably DO own slaves there. How is it &#8216;racisss&rsquo; to bring it up?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a different standard we&rsquo;re held to,&rdquo; Steinhauser said. </p>
<p>And he is mystified as to WHY there&rsquo;s a double standard - completely clueless! It&rsquo;d be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad.</p>
<p>The tea party members better stop groveling to these NAACP street thugs with a tie and wake up to the fact that they have declared war on any sane minded White people. They know that we see right through them and are TERRIFIED that we will awaken a sleeping giant that will put an end to their &#8216;racism gravy train&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>What we are seeing is a political and social climate that is so controlled by the Left that even token &#8216;resistance&rsquo; is seen as &#8220;racist.&#8221;  This climate is growing exponentially so that with every coming year it is more and more impossible to point out the obvious fact of racial differences.  Again, as Jared Taylor has repeatedly pointed out&hellip;thoughts and policies that were common sense up until the mid-60&rsquo;s have now effectively been outlawed in the arena of ideas and political discourse.  A genuine Right wing racially conscious position is out of the question because of the Left setting the boundaries of the argument.  The Tea party, while admirable for some of its economic positions is merely a shadow of real dissent, completely neutered by the fact that advancement of White people must never be allowed again in this once great country of ours. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll give Beny Jell Yell some racism to worry about, and I&rsquo;ve been two Tea Parties (I knew the Tea Parties were doomed when I saw only ONE Confederate flag- should have been thousands!)</p>
<p>Come on White Humanity, see if you can spot the error in this:  https://mije.org/health/mind-gap</p>
<p> &ldquo;However, we must continue to pay close attention to the achievement gap that shows students of color and poverty are trailing behind their peers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right! Elevated White students who are succeeding have no &#8220;peers.&#8221;  This &#8220;peers&#8221; scam is of the same play book as the over usage of superlative adjectives whenever describing blacks: &#8220;distinguished, renowned, esteemed, courageous, giant, pioneering, trailblazing, heroic, courageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only blacks who would ever qualify for those honors are the ones in Africa who were successful in ridding themselves of an oversupply of their black cousins by exploiting the White Europeans in the slave trade.   We endlessly suffer from that transaction, and while the wealth earned by the tribal chiefs is all wasted away, they still have the victory of having fewer blacks in Africa than they would have without our compliance in the deal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s only allow honorific titles to blacks who do the right thing and go back home to Ghana and stay there for good!</p>

		<p>Interesting how being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; is now the ultimate condemnation.  The term used to mean one who believed there were differences between the races, with the somewhat pejorative implication that some races were inherently superior to others.  </p>
<p>Now that this assumption has been established beyond any doubt, both by empirical evidence, history, and quantifiable intelligence testing, accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; appear doubly ridiculous. Those who would deny this are truly the modern-day Luddites and Flat-Earthers.</p>

<p>Wow - real scary. They&rsquo;re watching. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think with black unemployment at record levels, 70%+ of blacks born out of wedlock, 1 in 4 black males in the prison system, and a black high school graduation rate under 35% the NAACP would have better things to do.</p>
<p>This race-baiting, useless organization has degenerated to the point that now their function is to simply sit around and watch for any signs of perceived &#8220;racism&#8221; so they can claim damages. Very pro-active, I must say.</p>
<p>No matter what you think of the tea party and its politics it clearly has liberals, and especially blacks, very frightened.<br>
 <br>
Blacks, through no help on their part, have seemingly become used to more and more handouts, to pandering, and to public pronouncements of inclusiveness. Now, suddenly, something different has appeared.</p>
<p>Masses of white people- and remember, we&rsquo;re still the majority - have gathered across the country with rumblings of no more government spending, no more affirmative action, and no more listening to Al and Jesse. </p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen - especially with a brother as president. Whites were supposed back down, not show up 300,000 strong in Washington. Only blacks could have fancy rallies proclaiming their rights.</p>
<p>The NAACP is so ineffective and morally bankrupt they are now playing the race card as their last hand - they&rsquo;re &#8220;watching.&#8221; Big deal. Who exactly are they going to complain to when they make up more stories? A lot of those white folks who were supposed to help them are now at tea party rallies. Or at least that&rsquo;s how they see it.</p>
<p>Seriously, the bottom line is that blacks are not worried about racism - they are worried about the gravy train coming to an end. The giveaways and preferences and all the other goodies are not only being taken off the train but white people are dismantling the tracks. </p>
<p>Blacks are essentially helpless on their own. Liberals know this, blacks know this, and whites know this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to get interesting!</p>

		<p>NAACP joins with left blog editor &#8220;Faiz Shakir&#8221; to tracke racism in Tea Party.</p>
<p>Faiz. Some American. Your forefathers fight at Valley Forge or Okinawa? Khe Sanh?</p>
<p>You, Faiz, know racism when you see it. Otherwise why would the objective nonpartisan NAACP use you to identify racists?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you investigate what Kurds suffer from Arabs? Or what black Africans in Sudan suffer from peaceful Sudanese Muslim moderates?</p>

		<p>That is all the Left has.</p>
<p>How can they explain or justify:</p>
<p>* Massive illegal immigration</p>
<p>* Aberrant behavior of minorities</p>
<p>* Political Correctness</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t. So if they can&rsquo;t debate you they try to silence you.</p>
<p>Hence the never ending charge of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The NAACP, the Nation of Islam, The Black Panthers, La Raza, and the Brown Berets are the most Racist Organizations in the U.S.. </p>
<p>Who is watching them? Certainly not the Liberals in the News Media, which chooses to be their mouth piece, instead of independent, Investigative Journalists. </p>
<p>We need to intensify our scrutiny of these, and other related groups, and put the spotlight on them, for all of White America to see what they are all about.</p>

		<p>The mainstream conservatives need to quit worrying about what the left thinks. If the conservatives would just realize these people are their enemies. Plain and simple. You don&rsquo;t try to rationalize  or justify your actions to your enemy. You just try to win the war. Like James Edwards has said repeatedly, being white = being a racist. Ignore the term.</p>

		<p>James Edwards&rsquo; book &ldquo;racism shmacism&rdquo; lays spells it out very well.</p>
<p>All White Americans are considered &#8220;RACIST&#8221; just by being White and living in North America. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say or do, you can and will be smeared with the &#8220;RACISM&#8221; smear. Get used to it. Prepare for it, same way you should prepare for what to do in some nature emergency.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever whine, back down, try to appease your accusers. It doesn&rsquo;t work, just makes you and our people look weak.</p>
<p>I am using a new response to the &#8220;You&rsquo;re RACIST&#8221;.  I reply:</p>
<p>No - not &#8220;RACIST&#8221; &hellip; WE R Rassssseeeezzt - which comes from an ancient Sanskrit word meaning roughly &#8220;Someone who isn&rsquo;t a complete idiot&#8221;.</p>
<p>It works in many areas. For instance would I let my daughter go party with Black gangbangers who want to smoke crack and watch hard core porn films? NO. Because&hellip; WE R Rassssseeeezzt</p>
<p>Do I want to take a vacation to Pakistan or some Pakistani dominated area of Oldham England? No - because..</p>
<p>WE R Rassssseeeezzt</p>
<p>But whatever you do,  never back down or stay on the defensive. The best offense is a good defense.<br>

		<p>Why does anyone even care what the leaders of the NAACP think or do? Why does anyone walk on eggs for fear of being called a racist? Whether you use racial epithets or PC euphemisms, any statement Whites make about Blacks that isn&rsquo;t fawning is vehement racism, so why not start telling it like it is.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to wear one of those t-shirts from the gun show that has a picture of several K people which reads, &#8220;The Original Boyz In The Hood&#8221;. You don&rsquo;t have to start calling people names that only serve to hurt feelings or evoke anger. You can be honest about what you think  without being hateful. </p>
<p>If you make a statement that wasn&rsquo;t intended to be racist but somebody takes it as racist, then that is their problem, not yours. NEVER try to prove you aren&rsquo;t racist.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be seen in public with singing blacks to prove you don&rsquo;t hate Blacks just for being Black. You are not a diplomat who represents the White race. You don&rsquo;t have to make any compromises or concessions and you don&rsquo;t have to prove anything and you don&rsquo;t have to pretend to accept a viewpoint that is not yours. </p>

		<p>Most Americans see through this charade now.  Charges of racism are like the boy who cried wolf one too many times.  People are so desensitized to it that even if someone was a true hard core, hating vicious racist I doubt anyone would really care.  It amazes me that the lumps at the NAACP think this still works. </p>

		<p>I agree with #26 and #28.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;racist&rdquo; has simply become a derogatory for &ldquo;white&rdquo;, much like the &ldquo;n-word&rdquo; for blacks.  Just as some blacks in the &ldquo;hood&rdquo; use the n-word among themselves, so do some whites (liberals) call other whites the &ldquo;r-word&rdquo;.  However, non-whites are allowed to use the &#8220;r-word&#8221; with impunity, unlike whites who do not use the &#8220;n-word&#8221; and would be severely reprimanded for so doing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s expose the &ldquo;r-word&rdquo; for what it is:  anti-white &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo;.</p>

		<p>Racist and anti-racist are ways to demonize whites.  Blacks and liberals would soil themselves if white conservatives got a backbone and made this country like it was before WWII. Blacks think whites are so insecure, yet it is they  &mdash;  blacks and other non-whites  &mdash;  who force themselves into white society</p>

		<p>This reminds me of some kind of witch hunt from the middle ages. The next thing you know they will be burning people at the stake.<br>
The real motivation for this &#8220;witch hunt&#8221; is because the NAACP doesn&rsquo;t like the fact that whites are starting to get together and they don&rsquo;t know what to do about it so they are trying to demonize events like tea party rallies and the Glen Beck rally.  This without any doubt shows who the real racists are.        </p>
