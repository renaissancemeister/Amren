			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Dennis, San Antonio Examiner, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mayor of Tanciatro, Mexico, whose body was found in the back of a pickup or flatbed truck, was apparently stoned to death according to local and international new sources on Tuesday, September 28, 2010.</p>
<p>The killing of Gustavo Sanchez brings the public official killing count to five since mid-August in Mexico.  The mayor&rsquo;s body was thrown in the back of the truck along his an aide who was also killed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexico death toll is over 29,000 since President Felipe Calderon launched a war on drug cartels in late 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, September 23, a mayor of a small town near Monterrey, Mexico was killed by armed men. The next day, a mayor-elect in northern Mexico was shot in the chest and head by drug gang members.</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department travel advisory remains in effect warning of growing violence, primarily in the six northern states of Mexico..</p>

		<p>None of this will dissuade the stoners from getting stoned, and then, in their stoned state, from continuing to blame Bush.</p>

		<p>Let me guess, the stones used to kill him were traced back to the United States. </p>

		<p>How multicultural!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it grand how the Mexicans have embraced the fundamentalist Muslim legal system and its punishments?</p>
<p>And how different is this, really, from ripping a living heart out of someone&rsquo;s chest to make sure the sun rises tomorrow?</p>

		<p>To CDE (#2):</p>
<p>Very clever! The claim that our 2nd Amendment is to blame for 29,000 drug killings in Mexico is pathetic but nothing new.</p>
<p>After all, for years any time a black or Latino thug was shot anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon Line the Chuck Schumer types blamed the South&rsquo;s &#8220;lax&#8221; gun laws for causing the deaths of these young pacifists. </p>

		<p>Are Oogabooga the Holy Hope Pope and his co-conspirators in Ciudad Mexico going to pontificate about lax American rock-control laws being responsible for this killing?</p>
<p>The smart money says that this was not the work of the narcos, because their killings are generally characterized by dismemberment and/or field-dressing of the victims.  Rather, it was likely the work of this mayor&rsquo;s own citizenry, who probably decided on a little local, do-it-yourself anticorruption campaign.</p>

		<p>In Islam, a man is stoned to death in a pit, buried up to his waist.  Such preparation may not be in practice here but I guarantee you that something is, not least because you are trying to induce massive cerebral bleeds as a result of mechanical force transmitted through the skull and death or even incapacitation is thus NOT guaranteed to be instantaneous.</p>
<p>I would like to know the ethnic and criminality breakdowns of the 29,000 dead too.  Generally, the more horrific the manner or numbers of killings, the more a message is being attempted to be sent but there comes a point where the message is simply that if you don&rsquo;t get rid of your tormentors, there will be nobody left at all.</p>
<p>As with all insurgencies, it is not in the best interests of the Drug Cartels to allow the fighting to reach that level of intensity.</p>
<p>Which leaves you to wonder: &#8220;What if?&#8221;  What if the term &#8216;war on drugs&rsquo; is factually -accurate-?  What if an entire segment of Mexico&rsquo;s population, numbering in the tens if not hundreds of thousands of people, are _on the other side_, social-susidied (drug welfare) by the sheer enormity of the drug trade?</p>
<p>What if these localized attacks on the leadership classes represent to counter to the Federales&rsquo; use of indiscriminate force to wipe out whole regions of drug supporters?</p>
<p>Islamics in SWA used roadside IEDs by burning a tire to melt the asphalt or digging out a segment of the sidewalk and replacing it with a premolded hollow replacement.</p>
<p>All of which took time.</p>
<p>In an operational circumstance where, &#8216;as usual&rsquo;, our opsec was riddled to the point of ridiculous by the number of indigenous personnel who knew Tomorrow&rsquo;s Route the ability to monitor that route and interdict the emplacement activity logistics was still essential to gaining the upper hand in prevention.</p>
<p>Nothing like a Hellfire through the forehead of a Patriot For God to make the rest of the team a little leery of planting  bombs.</p>
<p>For much the same reasons, it seems to me to be obvious that such exotic and time-intensive methods of killing individuals should be capturable on video by loitering UAV technology that presweeps the routes and offices of VIPs as much as 10-14hrs ahead of departure.</p>
<p>Just as it seems to me that covert RFID tracking of the effected government personnel should allow for much more time-critical effective rescue coordination of lower level officials.</p>
<p>Not in your expected route corridor between home and office at a particular time of day?  Send out the flying squad, we have a kidnapping.</p>
