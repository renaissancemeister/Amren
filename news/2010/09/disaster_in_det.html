			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terry Teachout, Wall Street Journal, September 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Detroit Symphony Orchestra is staring into the abyss. In order to survive a fix-it-or-else financial crisis  &mdash;  the DSO is expected to run up a $9&nbsp;million operating deficit by the end of 2010  &mdash;  the management wants to slash the pay of its musicians by nearly 30%. The musicians have responded by voting to authorize a strike, and it is widely feared that this may lead to the orchestra&rsquo;s demise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The numbers tell the tale: Nearly two million people lived in Detroit in 1950. The current population is 800,000. Forty of the city&rsquo;s 140 square miles are vacant. Downsizing is the name of the save-Detroit game, and Mayor Dave Bing, who is looking at an $85 million budget deficit, wants to slash civic services drastically and encourage Detroit&rsquo;s remaining residents to cluster in the healthiest of its surviving neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Can a once-great city that is now the size of Austin, Texas, afford a top-rank symphony orchestra with a 52-week season? Does it even want one? The DSO, after all, is not the only one of Detroit&rsquo;s old-line high-culture institutions that is sweating bullets. The Detroit Institute of Arts and the Michigan Opera Theater are also in trouble, and the editorial page of the Detroit News recently declared that Detroit is &#8220;no longer a top 10 city by any measure. The reality may be that this region can no longer support a world class orchestra, or art museum, or opera company.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They are remnants of an era when the city was awash in automotive cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Dickerson, the deputy editorial-page editor of the Detroit Free Press, reacted angrily in a column published last month to what he called the &#8220;elegiac resignation&#8221; of this editorial: &#8220;{snip} What&rsquo;s incredible, and ineffably sad, is the complacency with which Detroiters are shrugging off the disintegration of a cultural infrastructure our predecessors spent the entire 20th century putting in place.&#8221; But it isn&rsquo;t complacent to admit that Detroit may no longer be able to afford the DSO  &mdash;  or that the city&rsquo;s &#8220;unwashed masses&#8221; won&rsquo;t lose any sleep if the orchestra is forced to close its doors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What makes the Detroit Symphony different is that it is not a provincial ensemble. It&rsquo;s long been ranked as one of America&rsquo;s top 10 symphony orchestras, in terms of both pay scale and artistic quality. Many of the recordings that the DSO made for Mercury in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s remain in print to this day. But what few seem to want to admit other than euphemistically is that comparatively few of the citizens of Detroit appear to be willing to pick up the tab for such an ensemble. In a city that is itself in desperate financial straits, the care and feeding of a major orchestra is not a priority.</p>
<p>I agree with those musicians who argue that cutting the average salary of a DSO player from $104,650 to $75,000 will transform the orchestra beyond recognition. The DSO will inevitably lose its best members and won&rsquo;t be able to attract replacements of comparable quality. But the players&rsquo; decision to respond to the orchestra&rsquo;s financial crisis by voting to strike is a classic symptom of the cultural-entitlement mentality {snip}.</p>
<p>We like to think that great symphony orchestras and museums are permanent monuments to the enduring power and significance of art, but in the 21st century, we are going to learn the hard way that this is simply not true. Great high-culture institutions reflect the fundamental character of a city. In America, most of these institutions were founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as manifestations of civic pride. But when a city&rsquo;s character undergoes profound changes, as has happened in Detroit, the institutions are bound to reflect that transformation. {snip}<br>

		<p>Epic Journalism Fail: &#8220;Detroit News recently declared that Detroit is &ldquo;no longer a top 10 city by any measure. The reality may be that this region can no longer support a world class orchestra, or art museum, or opera company&hellip; . They are remnants of an era when the city was awash in automotive cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No mention of demographic shift away from White majority to afro majority.  Detroit is awash in blacks. That&rsquo;s the source of its africanization symptoms and pathologies.  Any city that becomes africanized becomes intolerable of White Humanity.     The South celebrates Detroit! Thank you for helping us keep our numbers of blacks down to a temporarily survivable number.  Can by Dixie Reb brother imagine how bad things would be down here if all those afros in Detroit never were there because they stayed down here?   If that had been the case, Detroit would be thriving because we would have exported ourselves up there to get away from our fatal oversupply of blacks.<br>

<p>The DSO NEEDS to close shop and the musicians move somewhere else. AND it is not the size of the city that is the problem not being able to afford a &#8220;{top-rank symphony orchestra&#8221;. That is not the question.</p>
<p>I cannot even imagine any resident of Dee even having the slightest interest in classical music in any form.</p>
<p>NOR could you EVER interest any of the residents of Dee to EVER develop an interest in classical music.</p>

		<p>Well they could replace those symphony players with black rappers who&rsquo;ll work for a fraction of the salary and draw huge throngs of the unwashed masses to listen to &#8220;Boom I got yo girlfriend, boom I got yo girl&#8221;.  It would also perk up the local economy with prostitution and drug dealing money.  Just kidding.</p>

		<p>No surprise here.  When England and France vacated their African colonies, virtually all of the &#8220;higher&#8221; culture disappeared.  Likewise, the (then) modern infrastructure simply disintegrated   &mdash;   over time roofs and water pipes begin to leak, light switches stopped working, buildings went unpainted, and broken windows remained broken.  The Africans quickly dismantled any civilization built by the Europeans.  The same process in now occurring in Detroit.  Detroit is reverting to the level of civilization that can be supported by Africans, in spite of the Billion or more Dollars that are poured into that economic black-hole annually by the Federal government and State of Michigan.   </p>

		<p>no one says much abut segregation -</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think our forefathers in the 30&rsquo;s and the 40&rsquo;s just tried to get away from blacks?  but they couldn&rsquo;t.  Do gooders were always pushing to get blacks admitted into sports or the Army or whatever&hellip;&hellip;  and when allowed in, trouble begins.  Look at the NBA now&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  thugs and drugs and attitudes&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  even though they&rsquo;re millionaires, it isn&rsquo;t enough&hellip;&hellip;NFL, Naacp, black caucus, obama, waters, jesse and sharpton. never enough and won&rsquo;t be until they take everything from you that you value, your children, your sports, your money.  <br>

		<p>Since &#8216;Detroit&rsquo; is often seen a symbol for something larger, it would be interesting to total the state and federal tax dollars shipped to Detroit every year, year after year. Decade after decade. But I suppose only an &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; group would bother to do that. </p>

		<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but is this the same Detroit orchestra that used to have candidates play behind a curtain so there will be no accusations of bias? However, not enough blacks were getting selected, so they initiated an affirmative action plan so diversity would be obtained?</p>
<p>Is this the one I seem to recall reading about (on AMREN?) a few years ago?</p>

		<p>&#8220;If the kind of people who build cultural institutions disappear, so will their institutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think I kind of disagree with the larger inference in that statement, however, it&rsquo;s irrelevent to whites who are disappearing. Does it matter to us how well society copes after we&rsquo;re gone? The important issue is that we are being pushed aside and pushed out. </p>

<p>It is indeed sad. In fact tragic. And how about the complacency with which Americans are shrugging off the disintegration of once great cities like Detroit? </p>
<p>The post-wartime collapse of entire cities (just coincidentally following the great &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era, of course) would be The Great National Scandal if it were not so easily blamed on modern technology (namely the automobile).</p>

<p>No my friend, they are remnants of an era when the city was populated by whites, and the refusal to recognize this is part of the problem.</p>

		<p>Sadly, while the excess capital created by corporations may create institutions such as these, every non-stimulus dime of the welfare state must go for grits and gravy.  I know that the Obama administration wishes to make broadband more available and, maybe, government should come to the rescue here by funding a series of high resolution downloads of modern music performed by Detroit&rsquo;s musicians.  These would be given away free and would give internet users around the world pristine recordings of music to which they would otherwise have no access.  (Go to counterstreamradio.org sometime and let beautiful dissonance wash over you.)</p>
<p>Those Mercury Living Presence recordings, audiophile fodder for decades, I have heard on vinyl mono and stereo, CD and prerecorded reel and they are riveting in any format  &mdash;  my stack of records alone is higher than my knee.

		<p>I know, let&rsquo;s close up shop in Puerto Rico instead!</p>
<p>They get something like 800 million a year in food subsidies to feed 4 million people who live on an island the size of Connecticutt (1,100 people per square mile, only The Maldives, Bangladesh and Calcutta are worse) that effectively DO NOTHING for the U.S. since they demanded that the USN cease using their land as an East Coast bombing/gunnery range.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s then dedicate those 800 million dollars to a capital investment group of gay white yuppies to &#8216;gentrify&rsquo; the city of Detroit.  </p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start RICO investigations on the existing black city government and a massive anti-drug, anti-violence, anti-gang crack down to remove the remainder of thuggery of all races.  Maybe even bring in State troops.</p>
<p>If you look at it as an /investment/, 40 miles of downtown in any major metro area, at a few thousands bucks a block, has got to be good business sense.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re waiting on some honest to goodness non-genital washing, America-for-White-Americans (the real meaning behind &#8216;19th and 20th century legacy institutions&rsquo;) action, let&rsquo;s also find these performers a home in a secondary city.</p>
<p>After all, while 100 grande a year is excessive to most middle class working stiffs, at least these folks are willing to show up and do some practicing each week with a year round performance schedule.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see Illegal Immigrants on welfare and S8 contributing anything like that kind of effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to choose between a heritage of great art and culture and a &#8216;future&rsquo; of idiots who view entertainment as an exercise in Univision soap operas and WWE chair bashing.</p>

		<p>Why would a city that has an illiteracy rate 50% and who 75% of its residents don&rsquo;t posess a high school diploma care about cultural institutions? When you add to that a population that is almost entirely black, it&rsquo;s a wonder that any European-based cultural institutions have survived. I doubt that most Detroit residents are even aware of the fact that they have a world class symphony in their city   &mdash;   they were far more excited about the fact that Jay-Z was performing in town a few weeks ago. He represents art and culture to them, not a bunch of white people playing Bach. </p>
<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s a miracle that the DSO and Detroit Institute of Arts have survived this long, but they will be gone soon.  It&rsquo;s sad because the museum houses one of the finest art collections in the world, but there isn&rsquo;t much &#8220;ghetto&#8221; influence so why should Detroit care? </p>
<p>After they fall, the two major universities in Detroit   &mdash;   Wayne State University and University of Detroit   &mdash;   will go next. It&rsquo;s sad because they are both fine universities (I am a graduate of Wayne) but again they are propped up by whites who reside outside of the cities. As the city collapses even further, students and faculty will flee in droves to schools west of the city.</p>
<p>For decades, white suburbanites have tried to lend a helping hand to save what culture remains in Detroit and every time they have had it slapped away and called &#8220;racist whites&#8221; who are trying to &#8220;control the city.&#8221; Now with all of Michigan in a hole, Detroit is finally going to get their wish because they are completely on their own.</p>

		<p>Classical music is a part of our culture that will not survive without a substantial white, or at least Asian, population.  I&rsquo;m surprised the DSO has lasted as long as it has in Detroit.  They do have a distinguished record, but I&rsquo;m sure that less than 1% of the current denizens of Detroit know anything about it or care anything about it.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s New York City doing, the center of high culture (such as it is) in the United States?  Well, the local public radio station used to play a lot of classical music.  And there was a commercial classical music radio station that, as one expects for commercial stations, had a less imaginative repertoire but at least was easy to tune in to, having a powerful transmitter.   Now there is very little classical music played on the NPR station (too white and elitist, I guess) and the commercial station lost its former frequency and transmitter   &mdash;   that got taken over by a Spanish language talk radio station.  The commercial station somehow merged with the remnants of the NPR classical music people and reemerged as a non-profit (regular beg-a-thons) station.  It&rsquo;s at a different frequency and has a feeble low power transmitter, so it&rsquo;s hard to get the station without a lot of static or interference from adjacent stations.  I see this as a little parable of what&rsquo;s happening to our culture generally, as white people fade into the mist.<br>

		<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised that the Detroit Symphony is still around. Even Motown Records relocated to Los Angeles, a few years ago. Perhaps the Detroit Symphony should rename itself the Michigan Symphony and relocate to a college town like Ann Arbor or East Lansing.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I think an Amren poster put up a link on a popular tube (no names), showing Pres. John F. Kennedy telling the International Olympic Committee (in 1962, I believe)  why Detroit would be a great city to host the 1968 Summer Olympics. They made mention of the Detroit Symphony being world-class. Of course, the patrons of the Symphony in the video didn&rsquo;t look like Ludacris or Notorious P.I.G. (I know, it was B.I.G., but the man WAS a pig). How quaint, it all look now.</p>
<p>After the Symphony goes, the art museum and zoo will be next. The schools, of course, died a long time ago. But of course, they&rsquo;ll find the money (from Uncle Sam) to build new sports arenas for their teams, every few years. In Detroit, that&rsquo;s &#8220;urban renewal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is that so, Comrade Teachout?</p>
<p>And how have euphemisms and outright lies since 1967 helped make a once great city, a once great extension of Western Civilization, into a paragon of &ldquo;desperate financial straits?&rdquo; Indeed, there are many fanciful whimsies and &ldquo;educated&rdquo; sociological assumptions on this topic, but it all boils down to revolutionary Red politics and it&rsquo;s outcomes. This being a one-way ticket into a &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; abyss, with of course such an &ldquo;African American&rdquo; and Arab ambiance as only Mo Town can offer. </p>
<p>You so admit this yourself, more or less, Comrade Teachout in such a simpering and whimpering manner when you write:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America, most of these institutions were founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as manifestations of civic pride. But when a city&rsquo;s character undergoes profound changes, as has happened in Detroit, the institutions are bound to reflect that transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sad thing being, that while the above is correct, you only want to exacerbate the problem by encouraging more diversity and &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; in that decaying Motor City. As if adding: Hispanics, Asians, and ever greater numbers of Arab and African Muslims with a little less &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; grandiosity, could ever make the place white and functioning again, as it was up to 1967!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>What does a veteran violinist with the DSO make per year compared with a rookie lineman with the Detroit Lions who finished one or two years of college and has an eight grade reading level or less?</p>
<p>The pro teams, except for the Tigers, have left the city,and are out in the more affluent, whiter suburbs. Why doesn&rsquo;t the DSO move to Ann Arbor, re-brand itself the Michigan Symphony? All its black fans can drive out to Ann Arbor. (BTW, the DSO is not very good anymore, is not one of the top US orchestras, and if it dies it will not diminish the quality of US based recordings of classical music.)Baltimore, Washington, Seattle, San Francisco, Houston and other up and comers have long surpassed Detroit&rsquo;s OK but not remarkable symphony, let alone the traditional giants of NY, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, LA, and St Louis. </p>
<p>But there isn&rsquo;t enough exposure for white and affluent Asian audiences of classical music as current youth gravitate to Lady Gag, so a move out of Detroit to where people with taste, brains and an aversion to mindless hip hop, tuneless &#8220;r&b;&#8221; ala Beyonce and Usher, and watered down 70&rsquo;s rock might be in order.</p>
<p>Why not? Black youth in the rubble of Detroit won&rsquo;t get their fix of Brahms or Shostakovich?</p>
<p>But stay in Detroit? Might as well bury the instruments and have a funeral. The DSO should have left years ago. Even Diana Ross and &#8220;lil&#8221; Stevie Wonder left decades ago, along with Motown.</p>

		<p>The author danced around the issue of how the city &#8216;changed&rsquo; without mentioning that it is a 95% black/latino city.  (I remember asa little kid hearing about Coleman Young and all his rants from my tiny town an hour away!)  Blacks and latinos have little interest in opera, museums or orchestras.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of them either, so I can&rsquo;t say I blame the current population of Detroit for not supporting them, but as a white person, I have always taken comfort in the presence of these sorts of cultural institutions and I have gone to theatre plays and the Detroit Museum of Art as a kid.</p>
<p>Remember the recent article about museums in South Africa?  The black run museums were slowly dismantling white art and replacing it with zulu baskets and such.  Remember how after the invasion of Iraq the Iraqis stormed the museum and looted it?  Only white civilization and perhaps Japan respects its cultural relics.  (Remember China had the cultural revolution and smashed much of its past!)</p>

		<p>Some perspective.<br>
Several years back the San Jose Symphony Orchestra was allowed to go bankrupt. silicon Valley is no economic wasteland - so why was the oldest symphony orchestra on the West coast permitted to die? Simply, demand for classical music disappeared. It meant nothing to the Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, and other Asian immigrant engineers. It meant nothing to the young crowd of financecers and technogeeks who are the economic motors of the area. The Symphony was attended by a population nearly all Anglo-Saxon which was not replenishing it ranks.</p>
<p>This microcosm reflects the Macrocosm. The number of people who listed to classical music has remained flat for over thirty years. As a percentage of population, this demographic is shrinking and aging. This reflects the revolt against the great tradition of Western Europe.  Even America&rsquo;s own classical music - Jazz - is in decay.  Pop, rap, hip-hop are the preferred recreations event among those who can afford to enjoy the most exalted expressions of the human spirit.</p>
<p>I hope some one will do the job medieval monks did in preserving the great heritage of the West for another time place that will appreciate them.</p>

		<p>evidence file 1 is wrong- Our oversupply of blacks down South is indeed fatal. Anne Pressley, Eve Carson, Julie Love, Channon Christian, Eugenia Calle, Christiana Leann Neal, etc., etc., etc., and nobody really cares enough to do anything about it.</p>
<p>In Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell called them &#8220;swarms of blacks&#8221; in Atlanta. </p>
<p>We call them &#8220;disgusting swarms of dangerous blacks.&#8221;  </p>
<p>She had the privilege of living during the better and safer days of glorious Jim Crow segregation. We are suffering through the horrible successes of Civil Rights Integration, which makes our blacks completely dangerous, which means it allows them to revert back to their natural africanized, feral status in nature. She never would have comprehended what has become of her beloved Atlanta.  If she had received any premonition about it, she would have written a few more chapters in Gone With the Wind, and all would have expanded the wisdom of Chapter 37. She would have written GWTW as a warning to us all, not just a love story about a snippy modern style acting &#8220;woman&#8221; set in the Old South. </p>
<p>(Gone With the Wind, one of my favorite books, is actually absurd.  Mitchell used a setting she knew and a history that surrounded her to set the scene for Scarlett&rsquo;s liberating attitude of womanly selfishness.  Mitchell would have done better putting Scarlett up north as some sort of queen tramp of tramps heroine character.  But we can forgive all that when we remember what Scarlett did when the Yankee bummer invaded her house and started up the stairs toward her. She did the right thing, of course. Back in the good old days, the Southern audiences would stand up and cheer when she pulled the trigger.  Now, everybody keeps quiet for fears of being accused of wanting to bring back slavery.  Good God Almighty, slavery was the worst thing to ever happened to the South, and our White Nation.  We don&rsquo;t want to re-enslave our blacks- we want to help them get back home to Ghana.  But never mind all that.  Is GWTW raciss? Yes! You bet! Very much so! That&rsquo;s why we love it, and we use it to make sure our babies are raciss to, in spite of Newsweek&rsquo;s horrors at White racial consciousness.)<br>

<p>Sadly, and in all honesty, a symphony orchestra in Detroit is pointless. You basically have a poverty-ridden, drug-addled, criminal culture with no family structure and a loose set of laws governing an african-based jungle society (and I use the word &#8220;society&#8221; loosely). </p>

		<p>In 1989, the <i> New York Times </i> reported that the symphony was in financial difficulty because the State of Michigan withheld $1.3 million in funding.   In an article titled <a/>
<a>&#8220;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/us/discordant-notes-in-detroit-music-and-affirmative-action.html&gt;</a> <br>
&#8220;Discordant Notes in Detroit: Music and Affirmative Action,&#8221;  the newspaper reported that the symphony &#8220;waived its stringent audition requirement.&#8221;  At the time, the city was 60% black and only one of the 98 members was black.  Politicians thought this racist.  So another member was added through affirmative action. </p>
<p>As the <i> Times </i> reported, <br>
&#8220;The case has challenged the artistic prerogatives prized by all symphony orchestras and has raised questions about the ability of an orchestra to become top-notch and still mirror the demographics of the community in which it performs. It has also illustrated the political vulnerability of orchestras dependent on state money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, over 20 years later, we know the outcome.  </p>
<p>If the symphony goes out of existence, how will the <i>New York Times</i> report it?   Let me guess: &#8220;Mean-spirited Conservatives Refuse to Appropriate Funds to Keep Cultural Institution Alive.&#8221;   Not When &#8220;Western Civilization Leaves, So Does Its Music.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The numbers tell the tale: Nearly two million people lived in Detroit in 1950. The current population is 800,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>The numbers are worthless unless the make up of the current population is known.  They consist mostly of people who would rather hear nonsensical rap and screaming primitive music than anything so difficult for them to understand as classical music.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The reality may be that this region can no longer support a world class orchestra, or art museum, or opera company&hellip; . They are remnants of an era when the city was awash in automotive cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Is there a single symphony orchestra in any predominately black country? Does black Africa host any European opera companies? Diversity-loving Liberals have tried minority outreach cultural programs for decades without any significant success. Yes, a few bright and unusual blacks do like classical music, like a few bright and unusual whites like traditional Chinese opera. </p>
<p>  I&rsquo;m old enough to vividly remember the glory days of the Detroit Symphony orchestra with such great conductors as Paul Paray, Antal Dorati, Neeme Jarvi, and Leonard Slatkin. Paray and Dorati made many fine records, some still in print, on the Mercury label. Neeme Jarvi recorded some lesser known classical works on Chandos. Unfortunately, great art can&rsquo;t exist without an audience and blacks generally are not a part of that audience. The demographic transformation of Detroit has changed that city&rsquo;s cultural landscape forever. <br>

<p>A lot of fine stuff was smashed to bits, sometimes in public, but a lot more was hidden and guarded and, remarkably, a lot more fine artefacts have been found and exhibited since then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the fact that rich citizens of the PRC are buying superb Chinese artefacts abroad and sending them back to China.</p>
<p>Add up all the fine Chinese stuff in Taiwan, Japan and in superb collections like those in Boston and it&rsquo;s probable that not more than 5% of the best artefacts were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.</p>

Despite their socially liberal tendencies, northern whites do a pretty good job of keeping non-whites,(black populations in particular), on their urban reservations and Detroit is a fine example. Consider it a strategy of damage control if nothing else. Urban containment and damage control has worked exceptionally well for decades through deliberate political, social and economic policies.  </p>
<p>Imagine if all these black Detroiters decided to head back home to their southern roots. You&rsquo;d have more than a half-million newbies living in your cities, suburbs, and rural areas, spread out all over the place.

 Detroit disaster coming to higher education-  honoring the slain civil right martyr is so important that you must not be educated in any subject other than civil rights and White wrongs on that day- Whites can&rsquo;t &#8220;build community&#8221; without help of civil rights memorial-  will All White fraternities now integrate in order to build community? Can Whites have their own communities?  How about a candle light vigil for General Nathan Bedford Forrest, instead?  Our institutions are now run by and filled by White liberal elites and their black pets who force students to believe that status only comes from lifting above ourselves the lowest forms of race, while the highest White Humanity is forced into a submissive, defenseless posture.  I pray in the name of Savitri Devi, let my people go!</p>

		<p>While white culture may once have valued its past (Jay #23), that too has fallen into disrepute. A number of years ago I visited my aging mother and visited the Smithsonian while in the area.  I had hoped to show my sons some of the wonders I remembered seeing as a child.  Not only had the famous pendulum disappeared from the museums, but also almost all the presidential memorabilia (personal possessions and such from Washington onwards) and many other classic exhibits.  Instead, we found extensive text and photo exhibits about how evil whites put noble Japanese in camps, how evil whites discriminated against poor blacks (the northern migration), how evil whites dropped an atomic bombs, etc. ad nauseam.  The same &#8220;historians&#8221; who inhabit academia and invert history are also running our cultural institutions.  Detroit may be an obvious stalking horse, but the rot runs deep and I doubt it may be excised.</p>

		<p>            This is a sad story because it will end in closing down a cultural remnant of civilization in a third world wasteland.   The DSO is kidding themselves by staying in downtown Detroit rather than relocating to a smaller city with a large university and a civilized community.   Obviously the population of &#8220;enriching diversity&#8221; has no use for classical music, art, or opera.   But the article also avoids two other critical issues.   <br>
            Who is willing to risk the lives of their family by venturing down into the war zone to attend a performance or visit the museum?   This is a free-fall problem in most cities where safety is nonexistent and police could care less if white people get killed.    This was even an issue in Richmond, VA before I moved 24 years ago.   Attending a performance at the Mosque downtown was somewhat risky, parking sucked and extended into worse neighborhoods, and the black council running the city could care less about the hall.   The Mosque, an historic concert hall built around 1928, has one of the largest Wurlitzer pipe organs in the country, but it lies in ruin thanks to the people that run the city which owns the building.   <br>
            The current valueless generations of all races are devoid of education and worship the basest excuses for music and entertainment.  These yuppies will never care a damn about art or classical music, and their children will continue to be brought up on rap and video games and Lady Gaga!   There is no constituency in these degenerates to support a symphony orchestra or museum.  An opera company is hopelessly doomed.   If any of these cultural remnants of western civilization that were so prized over the last two centuries are to survive, they will have to seek out oases of civilization like Salt Lake City where their survival doesn&rsquo;t depend on a third world population or a government obsessed with social engineering.<br>

Which they will soon destroy too. Just as they did the old ones.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Great high-culture institutions reflect the fundamental character of a city. In America, most of these institutions were founded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries &hellip; But when a city&rsquo;s character undergoes profound changes, as has happened in Detroit, the institutions are bound to reflect that transformation.&#8221;<br>
__   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>&#8220;A city&rsquo;s character&#8221;?  Are you trying to say a city&rsquo;s <i>racial make-up?</i> Is that what you really mean?</p>
<p>Note the delicate euphemisms, the careful dancing around the hot topics that characterize this type of labored reporting.  This is the situation we have in America today.  Nobody dares mention the elephant sitting in the room. They go to great lengths to ignore it.  It&rsquo;s race!  More specifically, it&rsquo;s the RACIAL transformation that&rsquo;s going on. Those once-cultured cities with their great art institutions were WHITE cities in the &#8220;late 19th and early 20th centuries&#8221;.  Not so any longer. </p>
<p>The people have changed, and so the culture has changed. <br>
(But we&rsquo;re not supposed to say that! After all, everybody is the same, and race is just a social construct.) </p>

		<p>Cities like Detroit where there is a majority or critical mass of blacks has the additional problem of not being able to blame whitey.  In the past they would blame the city government for their ills.  Now they only have themselves to blame.  If they want an orchestra let them pay for one.  </p>

<p>You mean the &#8216;hard working&rsquo;, &#8216;assimilated&rsquo; Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, and other Asian immigrant engineers? Just as our Constitution, history, social mores and way of life mean nothing to them. Yet the vast majority of conservatives specifically &amp; whites in general constantly sing the praises of those who displace it all and in fact displace us as long as they are &#8216;legal&rsquo;.

		<p>I get that most blacks hate european classical music (their loss!!), and I&rsquo;m glad so many the asians love it.</p>
<p>what I find terrifying and bizarre is how few whites are even dimly aware of how great european music is and has been for centuries.  </p>
<p>nothing against pop, but this is our cultural heritage, and it should be an endless source of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional strength, and a source of pride.</p>
<p>a white person who has no use for bach and mozart, debussy and mahler is either depraved or deprived.</p>
<p>what else is it but race suicide when white poeple trash what is greates about european culture??</p>

&hellip;the San Jose Symphony Orchestra was allowed to go bankrupt. silicon Valley is no economic wasteland - so why was the oldest symphony orchestra on the West coast permitted to die? Simply, demand for classical music disappeared. It meant nothing to the Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, and other Asian immigrant engineers. It meant nothing to the young crowd of financeers and technogeeks who are the economic motors of the area. The Symphony was attended by a population nearly all Anglo-Saxon which was not replenishing it ranks.<br>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s because the Silicon Valley geeks work 16+ hour days, 7 days a week, especially in the first years of a startup.  They would love to hear the symphony but have zero time to go.  East Asians absolutely love Western symphonic music and I&rsquo;ll bet they have classical playing in the background while debugging code or hardware.  The Indians might listen to Bollywood instead, but they have more respect for Western classical than does the average US middle-class kid.  </p>
<p>Too bad the &#8220;financeers and technogeeks&#8221; didn&rsquo;t give their tax-easing charitable donations to this symphony.  Most MIT people I know are rabid over classical music (if you visit MIT near the end of a semester, there are student concerts and recitals almost every day).  Maybe the West Coast is different. </p>
<p>The stereotype of &#8220;engineer&#8221; as totally practical, tough, and prejudiced against &#8220;soft&#8221; or &#8220;pretty&#8221; arts doesn&rsquo;t apply to the Silicon Valley elite, who mostly did undergraduate work in subtlety-ridden, deeply-mathematical academic programs like MIT&rsquo;s &#8220;Course 6-2&#8221; (in the EECS department), and don&rsquo;t see arts as incompatible with such.     </p>

		<p>I saw a promo on TV for a new cop show this fall, in the same mold as NYPD. The show is called &#8220;Detroit PD&#8221;. I am willing to bet that the majority of criminals they portray are white. Leading a viewer to believe that the city is full of white thugs. Or should I say a liberal PC viewer. Anybody else here heard of this show?</p>

		<p>The new TV cop show about the Detroit Homicide Unit began this evening. Michael Imperioli stars as Detective Fish/ Fitch. This episode dealt with a double homicide in a pharmacy. The killer ended up being a White guy and it looks as though next week&rsquo;s episode will also feature a White criminal. The chief of detectives is a Black woman. I suspect that we won&rsquo;t be seeing too many if any at all Black criminals portrayed in this series. So much for realism!!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Is there a single symphony orchestra in any predominately black country? Does black Africa host any European opera companies?&#8221;</p>
<p>A friend of mine from high school is now a very talented concert pianist (he won the New Orleans International piano competition a few years ago) who tours frequently; he is currently in South Africa (I won&rsquo;t stop worrying until he is back home safely) giving concerts, but I have no idea who is attending. </p>
<p>I went to a recital he gave in my city a few months ago, and the whole audience was white. I don&rsquo;t see the point of even pretending for an instant that blacks and mestizos will ever &#8220;get&#8221; classical music.</p>

		<p>The principal problem with replacing the Detroit orchestra with a rap orchestra is that such a large a number of rappers will not get along with each other, let alone their retinues, who are notorious for not playing nice with each other.  The gunfire in the auditorium at every &#8220;concert&#8221; would closely resemble the battle of Falluja.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this might really be more of a solution than a &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>

<p>Detroit is beyond the comprehension of Europeans.  The worst immigrant areas in Europe are no where near as bad as Detroit.  Physically, the city looks like Stalingrad in 1943.  Social conditions are closer to Mogadishu than the immigrants slums in Berlin, Paris or London.  </p>
