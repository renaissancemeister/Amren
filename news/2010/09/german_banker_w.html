			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The controversial German banker who sparked outrage after saying &#8216;all Jews share a certain gene&rsquo; has said he will step down from his position on the Bundesbank&rsquo;s board at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Thilo Sarrazin, 65, has polorised Germany with his trenchant views and in the past year has managed to upset Jews, Muslims, the poor and all of Germany&rsquo;s main political parties  &mdash;  while also becoming a bestselling author backed by broad swathes of the German public.</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of mainstream politicians to demonise Sarrazin, he has struck a chord among his countrymen with a message that Germany is &#8216;dumbing down&rsquo; due to  immigration  &mdash;  and one in five admitted earlier this week that they would vote for him.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said he would quit the Bundesbank&rsquo;s board from the end of September after his divisive remarks on race, religion, and immigration earned him censure from Chancellor Angela Merkel and prompted the central bank to seek his dismissal.</p>
<p>His resignation, announced yesterday, means President Christian Wulff no longer has to decide whether to approve the Bundesbank&rsquo;s request, an awkward task that threatened to expose Merkel to a backlash from conservative voters.</p>
<p>Sarrazin, a former finance minister of the city of Berlin had long been outspoken, but recent claims that Jews shared a particular gene and Muslim immigrants were lowering the intelligence quotient of German society proved a tipping point.</p>
<p>Uproar over his contentious musings culminated last week with the publication of the banker&rsquo;s new book &#8216;Deutschland schafft sich ab&rsquo; (Germany does away with itself), and Sarrazin is now under police protection following threats to his life.</p>
<p>Sarrazin&rsquo;s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have also begun proceedings to expel him, though he has said he aims to &#8216;go to his grave&rsquo; a member of the SPD. Polls show the party has been hurt by the debate over whether to eject him.</p>
<p>Having inflamed opinion in 2009 with disparaging remarks about Germany&rsquo;s large Muslim population, Sarrazin&rsquo;s book makes a number of claims that have been seized on by far-right parties as a vindication of their own policies.</p>
<p>In 2009, Sarrazin  &mdash;  who has been compared to Geert Wilders, the head of the Netherlands&rsquo; anti-immigration Freedom Party  &mdash;  was stripped of some of his duties at the Bundesbank after comments in a magazine interview.</p>
<p>He had said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t need to accept anyone who lives off the state, rejects this country .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and is always producing little girls with headscarves. This is true of 70 per cent of the Turkish and 90 per cent of the Arab population of Berlin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Right-wing online forums have hailed Sarrazin as a champion of free speech who is addressing painful truths.</p>
<p>One featured an image of the former rail executive that parodied U.S. President Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008 &#8216;Hope&rsquo; election campaign poster.</p>
<p>But many advocates of improving integration say Sarrazin has made it harder to hold objective debate on the matter by polarising opinion and obscuring the facts with disputed claims.</p>
<p>Polls have showed Germans are divided about Sarrazin&rsquo;s views, though many phone-ins came out strongly in his favour.</p>
<p>His 464-page book, which has become a bestseller, argues in part that Muslims undermine German society, sponge off the state and may swamp the country due to a higher birth rate.</p>
<p>While in the capital, Sarrazin won praise for cutting the city&rsquo;s huge budget deficit, racking up the first budget surplus in its postwar history in 2007.</p>
<p>However, a talent for stirring up controversy  &mdash;  including his suggestion in 2008 that the poor could wear sweaters if their heating bills got too dear  &mdash;  meant many in the SPD were glad to nominate him for a move to the Bundesbank in 2009.</p>
<p>Prominent figures were not spared his scorn.</p>
<p>In 2007, Sarrazin called ex-SPD chief Oskar Lafontaine an &#8216;arsehole&rsquo; on television.</p>
<p>Prominent German Jewish journalist Michel Friedman described having the same experience last week.</p>
<p>Sarrazin, a civil servant since 1975 whom the German press once nicknamed &#8216;Rambo&rsquo; for his no-holds-barred approach to politics, alienated many of his former allies after departing Berlin for the Bundesbank in May 2009.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too bad Sarrazin made the remarks about Jews.  He could have done so much better for Germany if he had not conjured up the &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; mentality.  Jews have been part of Germany and Western Europe since the early centuries of Christianity, and even before, as suppliers to the Roman Army and garrisons.  Jews historically assisted Europe&rsquo;s rise while Islam tried to conquer it militarily.  Sarrazin&rsquo;s lack, or anyone&rsquo;s lack to see the differences is tragically misinformed and bound to hinder any productive effort to preserve and protect Europe.</p>

		<p>As always, it is interesting (if disheartening) to watch the contortions of the people who write these liberally skewed articles.</p>
<p>&#8220;recent claims that Jews shared a particular gene and Muslim immigrants were lowering the intelligence quotient of German society proved a tipping point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just too much obvious truth, I guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-wing online forums have hailed Sarrazin as a champion of free speech who is addressing painful truths.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note the condescension and thinly veiled hatred.  Support is not confined to &#8220;right-wing online forums&#8221;, but is heard from the mouths of the common man and woman across the land.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Uproar over his contentious musings&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no uproar outside of the politicians&rsquo; offices.  Quite the contrary:  there was jubilation.  The &#8220;musings&#8221; are naked truths, and are not &#8220;contentious&#8221; to those who are allowed to see and think.  They are plain truths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarrazin has made it harder to hold objective debate on the matter&#8221;</p>
<p>Here again, it is exactly the opposite.  He has brought objectivity to the discussion, only to have it refused on ideological grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polls have showed Germans are divided about Sarrazin&rsquo;s views, though many phone-ins came out strongly in his favour.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would wager that well over half, probably more than 3/4, of ethnic Germans support his views.</p>
<p>&#8220;His 464-page book, which has become a bestseller, argues in part that Muslims undermine German society, sponge off the state and may swamp the country due to a higher birth rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the problem with those words is &hellip; what?  Their truth?<br>

		<p>Sarrazin should run for Chancellor, or maybe for President of the European Commission. If they put in the Nationalist leaning politicians now, they have at least some chance at avoiding the mass bloodshed that will come in the future. Everyone wanted the Europeans to stop killing each other, but that didn&rsquo;t mean we wanted them to commit suicide by immigration.</p>

		<p>The fact that Sarrazin is stepping down from his post, in no way repudiates the fact that he has struck a nerve with much of the German rank-and-file. I agree with poster &#8220;Whiteplight&#8221;- the remarks about the Jews were rather unfortunate, even if true; but his comments about Muslims was spot-on. His book is a best-seller. Sarrazin can write his own ticket - maybe not into politics - but he can have his own television or radio show - assuming he&rsquo;ll get German governmental approval.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s refreshing to see more and more people whipping the cloth of political correctness from their faces, and daring to speak out against the evils of Islam. Keep up the good work Herr Sarrazin.</p>

		<p>A typical piece of shameless propaganda, disguised as &#8220;news&#8221;, from a sleazy British tabloid!</p>
<p>Just note how the very first sentence of the very first paragraph sets the tone:<br>
  <i>&#8220;The controversial German banker who sparked outrage after saying &lsquo;all Jews share a certain gene&rsquo; &#8220;</i></p>
<p>This is how they lead off the article! Nothing about Turks, who are, presumably, the topic. The article is not about Jews at all. But you would think so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Controversial&#8221;, &#8220;outrage&#8221; &hellip; and the juxtaposing of the words  &#8220;Jews&#8221; and &#8220;Germans&#8221; within the same sentence is a guaranteed formula for making  mischief. Without saying anything more, it conjures up images of a certain former regime, not so long gone, that most Germans would prefer to forget and which scares the wits out of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And where&rsquo;s all that &#8220;controversy&#8221; and &#8220;outrage&#8221; (outside of the press) when in fact a large element of the German population agrees with him? (And I&rsquo;m sure an even larger proportion who dare not say so.)</p>

<p>Actually, he said good things about Jews otherwise, that they have a high IQ, and that the Nazis&rsquo; attempts to kill them off had a cataclysmic effect on German science which it hasn&rsquo;t yet been able to recover. Their sharing certain genes is a &#8220;duh&#8221; point, since they all come from the same basic tribe.</p>

		<p>The Jewish gene thing seems mutually exclusive from the Muslim comments and I truly have a hard time seeing why that created such a fuss. In my opinion the blowback was related to his remarks about muslims.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jewish - I&rsquo;m not quite sure when Sarrazin became a geneticist but maybe we do share some genes - maybe not - whatever. The possibility of a shared gene among a very small number of Germans doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the future of the country. </p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s real problem is millions of dumb, unproductive, unassimilated, non-white muslims destroying the nation. Everyone knows that. The Jewish comment is a smoke-screen used by the liberal media to deflect attention from the ravages of low-IQ immigration.<br>

		<p>I agree with whiteplight that it was a mistake for him to make those comments about Jews. While they are factually correct -except for Ethiopian Jews, Jews from all regions are genetically related according to DNA analysis- they are of little interest for Germany and creates mental association to Nazism, hurting Sarrazin&rsquo;s good cause.</p>

		<p>1.) He yesterday explained: &#8220;I thought a lot about my decision and came to the end that I can not fight against all politicians and 70% of the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.) The Jews in Israel said repeatedly that they can not understand the discussion because of course most Jews have similar genes.</p>
<p>3.) The Gene thing had nothing to do with his book. It was a statement from an interview. But the media couldn&rsquo;t talk about the book because they know everything in the book is true. So they decided to talk always about the Jew-gene to make him look like a Nazi.</p>

		<p>Sarrazin did NOT disparage Jews. According to what I&rsquo;ve read, he said European Jews had a higher average IQ and Germany would be better off with Jewish immigrants than moslem immigrants. The remark about a &#8220;particular gene&#8221; is innocent and true. And Jews would be among the first to admit it. Every ethnic group, family and even individual has its own unique blend of genetics. Otherwise DNA evidence wouldn&rsquo;t stand up in court. The leftists are simply throwing it around for political points.</p>

		<p>I got a great idea: Sarrazin should run in an election.  Polls say he&rsquo;ll win 18% of the vote-so do it!  Geert Wilders-a man villified in every way possible-won 16% of the vote a few months ago.  Germany is the newest European country to wake up from this &#8216;equality, multiculturalism&rsquo; nonsense.  Germans are ready-it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Btw, by endorsing German &#8216;far-right&rsquo; nationalism, I&rsquo;m in no way condoning the idiotic neo-Nazis you see in Europe.  Nationalism DOES NOT equal neo-Nazism.  Muslims are the real Nazis-as are the fascist &#8216;multiculturalists&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Thank you for clarifying. I had actually worried a bit if this guy was saying some neo-Nazi type things about the Jews, but apparently he was only stating facts.</p>

<p>Interesting thing about those Ethiopian &#8220;Jews&#8221; - they have not a single drop of Jewish blood in them. This has been proven scientifically. The Israeli governemnt is completely idiotic to have air-lifted over 100,000 of this imposters into their nation, to become citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Btw, by endorsing German &lsquo;far-right&rsquo; nationalism, I&rsquo;m in no way condoning the idiotic neo-Nazis you see in Europe. Nationalism DOES NOT equal neo-Nazism. Muslims are the real Nazis-as are the fascist &lsquo;multiculturalists&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely, I only wish liberals and politicians could understand this about us.</p>
<p>&#8220;The irony is that the Daily Mail was pro-Hitler and pro-Nazi right up until September 1, 1939.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha! I&rsquo;ve heard that some of the Conservative newspapers back in the thirties supported fascist groups, but never fully realized the irony of it.</p>

   &mdash;   BlaakObongo<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Suppose he had said that all Germans share a gene or two in common; would that have been considered &#8220;controversial&#8221; and &#8220;outrageous&#8221;?</p>
<p>Would that have sparked a storm of media hysteria? Would politicians  have been rushing to denounce him and his bank to fire him?</p>
<p>His big mistake was in  mentioning ANYTHING about Jews at all. That gave the media all they needed to rip into him.</p>
<p>And mentioning anything about genes was also unwise, as it stirs up vague hits of nazism.  Marxists hate anything about genetics.  It&rsquo;s one of their worst bugaboos  (because it threatens the foundations of their ideology). He gave the media precisely what they wanted   &mdash;   the rope they needed to hang him.</p>
<p>And do note that his removal from the bank has nothing whatsoever to do with his management of the bank at all! It&rsquo;s entirely another matter.</p>
<p>Actually, if he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned either Jews or genes, they would have found something else to attack him. But he would have made it much harder for them. However, using those two delicate words (best avoided completely  in Germany) allowed them to tar him   &mdash;   if only subtly and by implication   &mdash;   with the standard nazi brush that is used on anyone who opposes immigration.  </p>
<p>Thus, in fact, the only ones being slurred here are Germans and Herr Sarazin.  </p>

		<p>I would imagine that Jews, and all other racial and ethnic groups, share some unique genetic markers.  I can&rsquo;t imagine any Jews I know (and I know a lot of them, many of whom I would count as friends) objecting to this simple observation.</p>
<p>I can only assume that it&rsquo;s been trotted out to resurrect memories of the Holocaust and to falsely link Sarrazin&rsquo;s views and comments with that dark time.</p>

   &mdash;   VoteBNP</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with you. But as far as Marxists go, ALL manifestations of nationalism ARE equivalent to fascism,  or are (at the very least) dangerously close to it. Especially in Germany.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the pathetic and never-ending protests we hear from the Right, claiming that  &mdash;   &#8220;We&rsquo;re not racists!!!&#8221;  &mdash;    fall on deaf ears among the Left. To the anarchists, Marxists, and anti-fa crowd &hellip;  every nationalist is a budding fascist. And every fascist must be stopped.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Sarrazin can write his own ticket - maybe not into politics - but he can have his own television or radio show - assuming he&rsquo;ll get German governmental approval.&#8221;</i><br>
   &mdash;  SopranoFan</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not likely to happen in Germany! His face would never get on a TV screen.  There was a case, 2 or 3 years ago (it was also mentioned here on AR), of a very well known TV personality who had her own TV show. She made the error of saying - merely in passing - that the nazis had a strong family program. She was off the air the next day, lost her program, and has not been heard of since. Her public career is dead!  </p>
<p>Btw, I&rsquo;ve been trying to remember the name of that woman, to find out what&rsquo;s become of her.  Does anyone here remember? Surely some of our German readers will.</p>
<p>What she said was simply true. But you can&rsquo;t say that in Germany.</p>

<i>&#8220;Sarrazin is now under police protection following threats to his life.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Who are the people making theses threats? Native-born, historic Germans or others?</p>
<p>Here Sarrazin could have turned this into a huge win had he made a public production of his resignation saying, &#8220;The German people are hungry for my message. Therefore, I will resign to run for public office&#8221;.</p>
<p>Had he made that announcement, the German people would have praised him and his enemies would have been dumbfounded.</p>

		<p>The bigger issue is that Europe is losing its identity as it is populated by non Europeans&hellip; non whites. Concerning the Jewish statement&hellip; I&rsquo;d guess if and ethnic German says something positive about anything Jewish, it would be held suspect&hellip;and anything not positive as proof of a fourth reich rising. This is a sad predicament to be in&hellip;even more so now that we learn that the main character in this storm..(Hitler) was possibly part Jewish himself. I don&rsquo;t hate any culture or see ANY logic in doing so&hellip;.. and that includes Muslims/ Arabs etc&hellip;And as for Jews&hellip; they range all over the board politically&hellip; They are not the destruction of western culture that some extreme right wingers want to paint them as.. not as I see it. Jews are funny often intelligent generous people. Both Muslims and Jews have contributed good things to western culture&hellip; Muslims preserved much of classical Hellenistic and Roman culture that would otherwise be lost to the world&hellip; after Rome was sacked in  410 AD. Interestingly, when Julius Caesar was assasinated&hellip; a large group of Jews mourned his death in sincerity&hellip; saying he treated them kindly. And as for the neo Nazi idea&hellip; that Jews always stick together and want to conquer the world&hellip; this is more ugly deception&hellip;in fact their final downfall to the Romans may well have been infighting within their remarkable fortress in which case they burned their own food supply. The main issue as I see it is to try to maintain some clarity in Identity of nations so that confusion doesn&rsquo;t become the norm&hellip; Harmony is necessary for sanity. If any thing Is noble in our western culture it is the love of reason, truth and justice&hellip; these we need always in the purest form possible.</p>
