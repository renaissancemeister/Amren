<h1><a href="/ar/2001/05/index.html#article2">Decline of the West</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Review by Thomas Jackson, American Renaissance, May 2001<br></i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Peter Hitchens is a reactionary  &mdash;  a forthright, unabashed, British reactionary  &mdash;  who thinks his country has gone badly wrong, and would like nothing better than to set it back on the tracks. Homosexuality flaunted, patriotism mocked, the countryside destroyed, the church ridiculed, standards demolished, rampant libertinism, the loss of sovereignty, liberal self-righteousness these are all unalloyed horrors to him, and he attacks them with a pitiless eloquence that is a joy to quote. There is much to admire in this book and little with which to quarrel  &mdash;  except that it says almost nothing about immigration. It is certainly true that the British have torn down Britain with their own hands, but if ever there is rebuilding it will be by whites alone. If Britain becomes increasingly non-white, nothing that has been lost can be restored.</p>
<p>This book&rsquo;s point of departure is a comparison of the ways in which Britain reacted to two deaths: Churchill&rsquo;s in 1965 and Princess Diana&rsquo;s in 1997. In 1965, London was still, as Mr. Hitchens puts it, &#8220;the world capital of restraint,&#8221; and mourning for the prime minister was heartfelt but solemn. The princess&rsquo; death 35 years later proved much had changed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it was the first royal death for more than a generation, it gave Britain an unexpected opportunity to take its own temperature, and to discover that it was suffering from a rather unpleasant fever. Those brought up in the older tradition were astonished, puzzled and even hurt to hear pop songs and applause at a funeral, and to see mourners who wept at one moment and took photographs of the cortège a few minutes later. Those brought up since the changes took hold were equally surprised, puzzled and annoyed by the restraint and self-discipline of the other half of the nation, seeing it as a failure to show correct emotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens explains that this mutual incomprehension was the result of changes so profound that those on opposite sides of the cultural divide hardly recognize each other. He describes the division of forces at the time of the general election that brought Tony Blair&rsquo;s Labour party to power after years of Conservative rule: &#8220;The two Britains which faced each other in April 1997 were utterly alien to one another and unfairly matched. One was old and dying, treasuring values and ideas which stretched back into a misty past. One was new and hardly born, clinging just as fiercely to its own values of classlessness, anti-racism, sexual inclusiveness and license, contempt for the nation state, dislike of deference, scorn for restraint and incomprehension for the web of traditions and prejudices which were revered by the other side.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Mr. Hitchens writes that in just a few decades the British have laid waste centuries of distinctive tradition, and by preparing to give up ever-greater swathes of national sovereignty to Europe, are poised quite literally to abolish Britain. He describes this cultural revolution as largely an assault on tradition that promoted the view that &#8220;rebellion was almost always the right attitude, that the ideas of the past were invariably wrong, that putting the clock back was a sin, while progress and change were both inevitable and right.&#8221; This mentality has rampaged through every British institution, and has left the country under a tyranny of liberalism that brooks no dissent. Long ago the revolutionaries perfected an especially nasty way of suppressing dissent, which was: &#8220;to impute personal failing, even some sort of mental disorder, to those who are against further relaxation of the rules. This is one of the most unpleasant techniques of the new conformism, which finds it very hard to accept that any normal honest person could disagree with its ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Television</b></p>
<p>In Mr. Hitchens&rsquo; view, television was probably the most effective tool in the hands of the wrecking crew:<blockquote>&#8220;When colour came, even the bad programmes looked good, and by the late 1980s a new generation was growing up, to whom the bright noisy plastic box in the corner was the most seductive, the cleverest, the most articulate, the most beguiling thing they had ever seen.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>The following passages are about the decline of sexual morality, but they apply equally well to cultural and racial norms of all kinds:<blockquote>&#8220;As time passed, the private beliefs of the majority would hardly ever be reflected in the broadcast media, so convincing them that they were in fact a minority and had somehow been left behind. As time went by, they lost confidence in a morality they had once been proud to support, and became ashamed of it. Enfeebled, isolated and pushed to the margins, the majority were not merely silent, but dumbstruck and powerless, afraid to defend themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pattern in all these events is the same: Behaviour which was once deviant is made to seem mainstream, or at least acceptable, and those who are unhappy about it are portrayed as narrowminded, old-fashioned, prejudiced and wrong. The effect of this implicit propaganda upon public opinion has been enormous, causing many people to be ashamed of views they had held since their childhood and had thought until recently were normal.&#8221;
</blockquote><p>Television everywhere is a relentlessly modernizing, iconoclastic medium that despises the past and glorifies the present, if only because it is <em>unlike</em> the past: &#8220;[T]he lens of television was sending society a picture of itself that was simultaneously flattering, dishonest and designed to encourage only one set of ideas about what was good  &mdash;  in politics, humour, architecture, foreign affairs, charity, fashion, education, and morals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding enormously to the destructive power of television  &mdash;  and to every socially corrosive force  &mdash;  was the pose all &#8220;progressives&#8221; struck as lonely and courageous visionaries:</p>

</table><p>&#8220;[T]hey had invented the image of an all-powerful establishment, made up of hanging judges, public school headmasters, hereditary peers, biblical bishops, militarists, Fleet Street barons, Royal Academicians who still liked proper pictures, the Lord Chamberlain, poets who rhymed and scanned, and of course the monarchy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [I]t was just as the moment when their influence was turning to dust and ashes that they suddenly became famous. They were required, or at least their images were, to make the younger generation feel as if they were true, bold revolutionaries, marching against a wicked foe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The sinister power of this imaginary establishment &#8220;gave the glory of revolutionary struggle to what would otherwise have been little more than the triumph of ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>In many households, television replaced community with &#8220;a network of imaginary friends and neighbours who were both more interesting and less demanding than they would have been in real life.&#8221; Often the television became a third (or, increasingly often, the second) parent. As purveyor of political, cultural, and moral standards, &#8220;television robs adults of one of their most important tasks as passers-on of culture to the young, mediating, explaining, sometimes hiding things until later when they will be less dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>People who watch more television rarely read, and the new species of Briton &#8220;has had little chance to develop its own critical, personal imagination through reading, and so has been a blank page on which the revolutionaries have been able to scrawl their own slogans.&#8221; As a consequence, television has &#8220;created a national conformism among the young, in taste, humour and politics, that is quite unprecedented.&#8221; Mr. Hitchens concludes: &#8220;To leave a child unsupervised in front of a television set is no less dangerous than giving it neat gin or putting it within reach of narcotics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain has come a long way from the days when the BBC was established as a state monopoly to promote high demeanor and Christian morality. The BBC long ago fell to the barbarians, but by ending the monopoly, Britain opened the door to the worst sort of profit driven prurience and vulgarity.</p>
<p>What have been some of the casualties? Mr. Hitchens quotes George Orwell: &#8220;England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [A]lmost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during &#8216;God Save the King&rsquo; than of stealing from a poor box.&#8221; With the help of television, writes Mr. Hitchens, &#8220;this once-laughable strand of thought and feeling would break out of its little bookish world and storm the culture centres of the country, making patriotism, monarchy and Englishness in general unfashionable and  &mdash;  worst of all  &mdash;  comical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as in the United States, history textbooks are now &#8220;drearily left-wing, and focused upon suffering and deprivation rather than upon achievement or heroism;&#8221; they teach &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and big government rather than patriotism. British history is now a chronicle of imperialist jingoism, inadequate care for the poor, persecution of homosexuals, and mistreatment of women. As a result, writes Mr. Hitchens, &#8220;we have been turned into a nation without heroes, without pride in our past.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; &#8220;If our ancestors had been like us,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;they would have lost at Trafalger and Waterloo, and given up on the attempt to colonize North America, because of the absence of safety nets, sexual equality and proper child care.&#8221; The new order has &#8220;brought to maturity a generation to whom the past was not just a foreign country, but a place of mystery which was easier to mock than understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was well in evidence in 1998, when the Japanese Emperor made a state visit to London: &#8220;[I]n a last dying twitch of remembrance, elderly survivors of Japanese prison camps held silent protests along the processional route of Emperor Akihito.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; This was denounced by the young as &#8220;deeply racist&#8221; and a sign of unhealthy obsession with the war.</p>
<p>In his one reference to immigration, Mr. Hitchens does concede, &#8220;There is no doubt that the arrival of a large number of immigrants from former imperial colonies has helped to confuse the teaching of history.&#8221; He regrets &#8220;the rush to apologize to our new multicultural citizens,&#8221; and seems to think that with a little effort, the new multi-cultis could be bred to British patriotism just like native-born whites.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens has a healthy appreciation of nationalism: <blockquote><p>&#8220;The nation-state, as many people forget, is one of the most reliable engines of unselfishness and human solidarity. If it breaks down, the feelings which would have found their home in it seek other places where they are welcome.&#8221; People may become fanatical and even violent soccer fans, for example, but it is what the disappearance of patriotism makes people <em>stop</em> doing  &mdash;  defend national traditions and contribute to national greatness  &mdash;  that is infinitely worse.
</blockquote><b>The Church of England</b></p>
<p>In Mr. Hitchens&rsquo; view, the pitiful collapse of the Church of England  &mdash;  there are now as many active Muslim congregants as regular C&nbsp;of&nbsp;E churchgoers  &mdash;  is central to Britain&rsquo;s decline. He write that the church not only taught morality but gave the British a common cultural and linguistic heritage.</p>
<p>Faith and the church have been butts of satire and contempt like all the other ancient institution, and &#8220;by the 1960s, eternal damnation, like most of the more worrying aspects of the Christian religion, had apparently fallen into disuse. Bishops .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had begun to admit, rather coyly to start with, that they were not sure about the existence of God or the truth of their religion&rsquo;s central beliefs.&#8221; It would not be long before &#8220;the Bishop of Durham, Dr. David Jenkins, would speak of the resurrection as &#8216;conjuring tricks with old bones,&rsquo; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>This had dire consequences because &#8220;a world without God meant no punishment for sin, and therefore no sin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The church tried very hard to stay &#8220;relevant&#8221; but if no one believed in God or souls or sin, &#8220;how was it to become &#8216;relevant&rsquo; to the new age without becoming completely irrelevant to its purpose of saving souls?&#8221; As in virtually every institution, the rot started at the top, and &#8220;the Church, like the railways or the government, was more and more being run for the benefit of its own employees rather than for the mere churchgoers or the nation itself.&#8221; As a result, congregations that were perfectly content, had all manner of noisome changes foisted on them. Rather than slow the defection of worshipers, &#8220;modernization&#8221; has hastened it, but this has not slowed the pace of destructive innovation. As Mr. Hitchens explains, the church once understood it <em>must</em> be conservative:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thomas Cranmer [author of the 1662 Book of Prayer that was until recently in common use] and the great translators consciously built their books to last, just as the architects of church buildings had done, and continued to do. They believed that some ideas lay outside normal time and could therefore be expressed in a way that defied passing fashion. This belief survived until the late 20th century,&#8221; when it was done to death with trendy new liturgy, music, doctrine, prayers, and church decorations.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens explains why the old, majestic liturgy had to go: &#8220;The glories of the language were offensive to the modernizers because they reminded them of what they owed to the past, because they reinforced the bonds of tradition, but above all because they constantly reminded them of a view of religion which was not theirs. It did not offer salvation through the Overseas Development Agency, the Anti-Apartheid Movement, Amnesty International and the Social Security budget. It offered it in an entirely non-political way, through the faith and deeds of the individual.&#8221; Mr. Hitchens points out that the old confessions vividly evoked the wretchedness of man caught in the toils of sin whereas the new versions &#8220;sound like the apologies offered by railway companies for late trains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens explains that &#8220;a man&rsquo;s moral worth is now measured by the level of taxation he is willing to support, rather than by his faith or even his good works. Other tests  &mdash;  opposition to apartheid or General Pinochet  &mdash;  are valued more highly than personal adherence to the Ten Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount.&#8221; As the church subsides into irrelevance, &#8220;many young children entirely deprived of a tradition passed on without thinking by twenty previous generations have no idea at all of what goes on in churches.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Mr. Hitchens notes that nowhere has there been greater change than in British attitudes towards sex, which were always much more conservative than those on the continent. Now, there are no social sanctions against fornication, which has brought with it soaring rates of divorce, illegitimacy, abortion, and disease. &#8220;Now the entire country seemed to be obsessed,&#8221; Mr. Hitchens writes, &#8220;with staring at naked female chests, swearing and making dirty jokes. Like the pagans of old, unaffected by climate, the British were now dancing round a giant phallus. Unlike the pagans theirs was a sterile phallus, disarmed by condoms and pills  &mdash;  the first heathen sexual cult to be based around sterility rather than fertility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens notes that the sex revolution has changed our vocabularies, not least by dignifying youthful copulation as &#8220;sexual experimentation:&#8221; &#8220;What, by the way, are these &#8216;experiments&rsquo; and the other &#8216;experiments&rsquo; in drugtaking seeking to prove or disprove, which is not already known? It is interesting that this word is so frequently used for wrong actions taken by the young.&#8221; Likewise, the disappearance of social sanction means we no longer talk about &#8220;unmarried mothers&#8221; or &#8220;broken homes,&#8221; but instead of &#8220;one-parent families,&#8221; as if they were just as good as the other kind.</p>
<p>Wittingly or not, government promoted bastardy by lathering promiscuous mothers with uplift and benefits that remove the penalties for reckless procreation. Of course, the helpless &#8220;oneparent family&#8221; is the perfect client of the state. Completely dependent on the Social Security budget, its members have dismantled the last bulwark against serfdom. As Mr. Hitchens reminds us: &#8220;The greatest fortress of human liberty, proof against all earthly powers, is the family.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All serious tyrannies have sought to undermine or infiltrate it, socialist tyrannies most of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hitchens concedes that the lot of the &#8220;fallen woman&#8221; was a harsh one, but accepting illegitimacy only made it more common, and condemned millions of children to the impersonal cruelty of fatherlessness: &#8220;Shame and stigma, which once both defended respectable marriage and heaped misery on the poor bastard and his wretched mother, have disappeared. Instead, there is the slower, vaguer, more indirect misery of a society where fewer and fewer children have two parents, and where more and more women are married to the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the left is now groping towards a realization that there is such a thing as depravity, and that a hereditary class of welfare recipients is not a blessing. However: &#8220;If you do not believe in sin, then you can hardly be expected to use up much energy fighting against it. And if you do believe in sin, then you are &#8216;judgmental,&rsquo; and automatically excluded from the debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mr. Hitchens calls all this &#8220;the Americanization of our sex lives,&#8221; claiming that &#8220;[Elvis] Presley dug beneath the fortifications of British sexual reserve, leaving them so weakened that John Lennon and Mick Jagger could knock them down completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The destruction of the family was yet another cause and consequence of monolithic liberalism: &#8220;[The family&rsquo;s] defeat during the last five decades has helped to produce the most conformist and least individualist generation in known history. Without a strong family, the growing child is much more easily influenced by his own age group, themselves under pressure from TV programmers, advertisers, teachers and fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nation that now approves of sport sex of all kinds can hardly disapprove of homosexuals, whom Britons dare not criticize but must &#8220;sentimentalize .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as modern heroes.&#8221; Mr. Hitchens notes an asymmetry: &#8220;Smoking and buggery can both kill you,&#8221; he observes, but smokers are foolish people who take dangerous risks while homosexuals are victims and martyrs. No one officially recommends &#8220;safer&#8221; smoking  &mdash;  low tar and nicotine. Complete renunciation is the only option for smokers, but &#8220;there is not even a hint of disapproval of anal sex or illegal drugs in official or semiofficial propaganda about AIDS.&#8221;</p>

</table><p>Much of what Mr. Hitchens opposes is the miasma of modernism common to all Western countries, but he has specifically British concerns. He thinks a small island is not a good place for automobiles, and that by supplanting an extensive train system cars have destroyed much of the countryside. He regrets the disappearance of regional accents. He is sorry that &#8220;specifically local or specifically British styles of architecture have given way to the international blandness of concrete and glass.&#8221; He also mourns the loss of British weights and measures and of the old currency system of shillings, florins, and crowns: &#8220;[I]t is an odd truth that this sort of measure, highly practical and tested as it is, rarely survives any sort of revolution. It requires deference and tradition to survive. Without it, the toe-counting simplicity of decimal and metric systems is all that is left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, of course, Britain is debating whether to join the European Monetary System and thereby lose not only the pound sterling but economic independence. For Mr. Hitchens, a false step means no return: &#8220;If we are what we used to be, then this is a last unrepeatable moment at which we can halt our extinction as a culture and a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Mr. Hitchens is describing is nothing short of tragedy. Like all men of the West, the British are a denatured people, so weakened and bewildered they are unable to resist even what would be genuine abolition: displacement by aliens. What makes it tragedy is that the British have done this to themselves. Mr. Hitchens recalls that to Evelyn Waugh, having Labour in power in 1945 was &#8220;similar to living under foreign occupation.&#8221; As for the current state of decline:</p>
<p>&#8220;A real occupation would almost certainly have produced a resistance, the circulation of banned texts and the holding of secret religious services. But a county which ploughs under its own culture, without violence or open suppression, has no such resistance. The objects of the attack are unaware that they are under attack, and there are no martyrs, no persecution to bring resistance into being.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revolution has been non-violent  &mdash;  so far: &#8220;I cannot guarantee that it will not lead to bloodshed in the end, as revolutionary ideas so often do, but it has been restrained up till now. For this has been a very <em>British</em> revolution, perhaps the last thing we shall do that <em>is</em> British.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If the only deterence from &#8220;sin&#8221; is eternal damnation as promised in the more nasty passages of the Bible, rather than the centuries of European philosophers that build a European conscious based on far more complex issues of ethics and belief that has made the Western mind superior to for example, the Islamic mind, then Western superiority is so thin that it hardly exists.</p>
<p>In raality, it is the event of the rise of reason and the Age of Reason that makes up the entire difference between the Islamic world and the West.  The reasons for the decline of the West is not the loss of the God-Fearing elements of Christianity, but the overemphasis on its softer tennets, such as we find in The Beatitudes, and the problems of Western addiction to the appearance of virtue and misplaced compassion, the general boredom with an increasingly bland commerical culture that at the same time goes to the limits of reason in utilizing sex for commerce, and the loss of pride in our ancestors due to both socialism and Christianities&rsquo; lack of emphasis on ethnicity and ancestry.</p>
<p>In short, I think Hitchens misses the entire issue here.  He is sex focused on the culture of the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s, but the history of sex for example during WW2 nullifies his attempt to isolate and blame &#8220;communist hippies from America&#8221; or whoever his target might be. As a folk music enthusiast, I can report that British folk music is full of sexually oriented folk music going back as far as the middle ages.  The debachery of both clergy and kings from before that period and on is well documented historically, for those who actually study history.</p>
<p>I constantly worry about the shallowness of current white realism, which seems obsessed with historically misunderstood issues and a general lack of knowledge of the very race they wish to save.  This essay reflects that shallowness and interpretation based on uninformed misinformation.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to get this right, folks.</p>

		<p>This is one of the more profound essays on the dissolution of civil society I&rsquo;ve read.  Of course, is applies equally to the US, largely for the same reasons Hitchens enumerates.  One major difference between us and GB is that&rsquo;s there still a strong element of religious belief here, however much it is reviled and contemptuously dismissed by the &#8220;elite&#8221; among us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Long ago the revolutionaries perfected an especially nasty way of suppressing dissent, which was: &ldquo;to impute personal failing, even some sort of mental disorder, to those who are against further relaxation of the rules. This is one of the most unpleasant techniques of the new conformism, which finds it very hard to accept that any normal honest person could disagree with its ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>In America conservatives can be tied to &#8216;racists&rsquo; and &#8216;racism&rsquo;, something even more absolutely damning. Of course this is only something for white citizens to worry about because &#8216;racism&rsquo; is in a synonymous with white. Peter Hitchens is wrong, though, thinking the average citizen can be reasoned with. They simply don&rsquo;t want to know of Mr Hitchens reality, or to know &#8216;the truth&rsquo;. Much as, say, black folks often seem to want to remain ignorant of what they surely must know to be true. &#8216;Enlightened&rsquo; folks today should be forced to compare crime statistics of today to what they were 50 years ago, both in the USA and in England, just for starters.  </p>
<p>Mr Hitchens does not &#8216;connect the dots&rsquo; however, connecting all these disparate changes in the West to simply an attack against white men. Perhaps this is where the hope lies in returning things to normal. Will there come a day when supporting white men becomes something the average citizen isn&rsquo;t afraid to do and there is actually movement in that direction? </p>

		<p>I have to disagree with much of this piece. I think it was not television, but the influence of the 800 pound gorilla in the room that led to Britain&rsquo;s declining standards. That 800 pound gorilla, of course, is the US. </p>
<p>The author did acknowledge that American influence played a role in declining morality.<br>
However, the American &#8220;civil rights movement,&#8221; and all the breast beating and orgy of self-recrimination that sprung from it, was also emulated by our #1 ally. Television helped, but it was not the main cause. </p>
<p>As well, the decline in the belief in sin was not the fault of liberalism, but, rather, the marching advance of science. Liberals just took advantage of changing beliefs and twisted them to fit their own ends. After all, science supports racialism far more than it supports liberalism. </p>
<p>Besides that, the old beliefs in sin have just been replaced with a new set of &#8220;sins,&#8221; that is, the belief in racial differences, proving that you don&rsquo;t need to be religious to fervently adhere to the concept of &#8220;sin.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Given that change (mass immigration) of this magnitude does not occur by chance the question remains who is behind this transformation of changing the once homogeneous European peoples in to a disunited, amorphous, and identity lacking flock of sheeple? Cui bono?</p>
<p>Mandatory diversity in form of mass migration as practiced in Europe, being condoned and in part brought about by the ruling select few, has resulted in anxiety, discord and a heightening of the day to day struggle for survival for the native populations of Europe. The easier to rule over us? Will &ldquo;those in charge&rdquo; in the end be as happy with their &ldquo;new&rdquo; subjects? </p>
<p>The indigenous peoples of Europe laid the basis for great civilizations, built vast empires and gave life a certain measure of happiness even for the working man, will this continue to be possible with the new brand of European being shaped? A cautious glance at the conditions prevailing whence the multitudes of migrants stem and you will have your answer.<br>

		<p>Hitchens describes the demise of England nicely but he incorrectly conflates England and Britain.</p>
<p>In Britain&rsquo;s Celtic periphery, the collapse of British patriotism has been redirected towards Scottish, Welsh, Orange and Green patriotism.</p>
<p>There are some of the same pathologies as in England but there&rsquo;s still respect for heritage and an ethnic awareness. This makes Britain&rsquo;s breakup inevitable in the longer term.</p>

     I have always disliked the sexual revolution.  A growing body of evidence indicates that children raised to adulthood by both biological parents living together in matrimony usually do much better in life than children raised in alternate situations.  This is even true when other conditions are held constant.       <br>

		<p>Much of the description of how the successful, cohesive Britain used to be could apply to the Unites States as well. The US may have sparked the forces that triggered decline here and in Europe. The Asians, led by the Japanese (good for the Brits in 2001 who gave the murderous Japanese royal family a hard time) and the Chinese are finishing the job as they increasingly control our media and our financial structure. </p>
<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t emulate their education system which at least features hard work, shame of poor behavior, and weeding out of non-successful students into practical occupations the nonacademic can handle. </p>
<p>We take the nonsense from Asia, ie endlessly shrinking computers and entertainment devices to dull the mind, and reject the best-ultra nationalism and tough education principles.</p>

		<p>Although a lot of what Mr. Hitchen&rsquo;s says is true he makes little allowance for generational changes over the years - some are good. If you have no advancement of attitudes, thinking and ideas, you end up like the muslim world, stuck in a rut. I do however agree that the change over the last few decades has been fast and furious. When my own children were at school I watched the politically correct brainwashing occur time after time.  There was nothing we as parents could do about it.  When my daughter was at high school we were invited in to be asked our opinion on various PC social studies lessons that were being introduced, no-one in the room was for it at all, but it still went ahead. Our son at his school had as his major topic in the History GCSE course - The History of Medicine&hellip;he to this day knows little of his cultural heritage compared to what we at school were taught in our day.  In pessimistic mode I can seen the white cultures, who are mostly the instigators of the modern world, being all but wiped out.  The goose that lays the golden eggs will be no more.  </p>

<p>A few years ago I was in a chat room and a guy there described in a kind of derisive manner what he felt was going on, kind of behind the scenes or under the surface. He described what he was witnessing as, &#8220;just self preservation&#8221;. It might be just the Peter Hitchens types who feel they are above self-preservation.

<p>Absolutely true. Innate human imperfection used to be called original-sin by the way. Our society has turned it&rsquo;s back on this idea much to our own detriment. In the &#8216;progressive&rsquo; eye, there&rsquo;s no amount of permissiveness that isn&rsquo;t going to make the world a better place. I&rsquo;ve argued before, though, that whites still live under the original sin idea to a certain extent - whites are evil &#8216;racists&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing they can do to escape it, they just are. They must be watched, legislated against and educated about. Non-whites, however, are all inherently good. Noble creatures who&rsquo;s only failings are caused by contact with the white world and it&rsquo;s corruption and inherent selfishness etc. </p>
<p>The difficult part of your statement is &#8216;honoring the past&rsquo;. The only part of past any of us know, exists as it has been written by progressives. Go back 30 years, and the past is the same as it is now. I could deal with honoring the memory of Enoch Powell. Perhaps it&rsquo;s important for us to reclaim the past. A call to the past at this point almost feels like a religious quest, so obscured is the real truth, and who among us has the intellect and the wherewithal to be such scholar of the past in this day and age? Most people have an incorrect notion of what is going on in our world in 2010, as it is happening, a call to examine the past&hellip; outside of dates and times&hellip; </p>
<p>What past? Certainly whites and Europeans have done great things&hellip; but it would be easy to draw the wrong lessons from them. The guideposts and the lessons are there, somewhere, and, myself, I am a firm believer of getting back to the basics&hellip; I suspect conservatives are going to be the ones to have to make changes.  </p>

		<p> 1 &#8220;I think Hitchens misses the entire issue here. He is sex focused on the culture of the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s, but the history of sex for example during WW2 nullifies his attempt to isolate and blame &ldquo;communist hippies from America&rdquo; or whoever his target might be.&#8221;<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
The military is not a chaste environment.  Those who blame liberals and hippies for the sexual revolution ignore the effects the two world wars and the War in Vietnam had on changes in sexual mores and behavior.  The first sexual revolution happened during the aptly named &#8220;Roaring Twenties,&#8221; when the Republican Party dominated the United States.  Church attendance declined then too.<br>

<p>You probably answered a question I asked in my own blog a month and a half ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2727u9y" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2727u9y</a></p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, &#8220;Shorpy,&#8221; the blog I link to three different times in that post, is a blog that features old photographs.  It was on that day that the people that run Shorpy found all these old photos from 1920 (give or take) about VDs.  So I&rsquo;m implying that there was a big outbreak of syphilis and gonorrhea in about 1920, and WWI was the reason.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of the opinion that the only reason the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; SEEMS to have happened when it did, with libs/hippies falsely getting the blame, has more to do with popular media censorship than anything.  It&rsquo;s just that the undoing of the Victorian era wound its way through the &#8220;grass roots&#8221; at first (like you said, thanks to no small part to WWI and WWII), then it finally cracked through the media, especially TV.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the origins of the sexual attitudes that came with the counterculture revolution of the 60&rsquo;s, I suggest you study the failed regime of Bela Kun and his Soviet Hungarian Republic in 1919. Notice the cast of the Usual Suspects. There is nothing new under the sun in some aspects. </p>
