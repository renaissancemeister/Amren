<h1><a href="/ar/1991/01/index.html#article3">The Rise of the European-American</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Jackson, American Renaissance, January 1991</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In an era in which the ethnic demands of everyone but white people are the subject of such obligatory interest, it is a pleasant surprise to find a book about the ethnic identities of Americans of European descent. And if, as the flyleaf claims, the author goes on to explore the dawning consciousness of whites as &#8220;European-Americans,&#8221; the book would seem promising. Ethnic Identity is, in fact, a useful analysis of what white Americans think about their European origins, and the book is worth reading for that. As a reflection on rising white consciousness, it is no more than one would expect from a mainstream university press.</p>
<p>The author, Professor Richard Alba, has based his book not only on general sources but on a detailed survey of white ethnic identity that he carried out himself. His primary message is simple: The American melting pot has been a roaring success, so long as its ingredients have been white. With the exception of Jews, virtually every group of European immigrants has, within three generations, become largely indistinguishable from the others. The old English stock painlessly absorbed immigrants from northern Europe, and even digested the southern and eastern Europeans and the Irish without much more than a gurgle and a case of heartburn.</p>
<p>As Professor Alba points out, the ultimate test of assimilation is the ease and frequency of intermarriage. On this score, there is virtually no European group that has failed to mingle with the rest. Three quarters of the marriages of white people today cut across lines of European nationality. Indeed, as the author argues, at this rate the very notion of European ethnicity is blurring.</p>
<p>Only Jews, with an intermarriage rate of only one quarter to one third, resist the final step to assimilation, and this resistance weakens only slightly in succeeding American-born generations. Jewish endogamy is even more remarkable, since a group that is no more than 2.5&nbsp;percent of the population would normally have a very high rate of marriage outside the group, if only because of the scarcity of potential spouses. Jews also differ from other European immigrants in that their levels of education and income far outstrip those of any other ethnic group.</p>

</table><p>Professor Alba is candid enough to contrast the otherwise rapid and essentially uniform assimilation of Europeans with the very different experiences of other racial groups. Hispanic immigrants, for example, do not show anything like the same patterns of education, income, and intermarriage as Europeans, even after three generations and more, and blacks are even less a part of the American mainstream. To his credit, Prof. Alba refrains from the usual bromides about how these groups can be expected to be absorbed eventually, just as Poles and Italians have been.</p>
<p>The United States has lost the old conviction that all newcomers must be made over in the same Anglo-Saxon image. Were this ever even theoretically possible for non-European immigrants, the disrepute into which the very effort has now fallen guarantees that assimilation will not take place.</p>
<p>As for white ethnics, the findings of Prof. Alba&rsquo;s own research are always interesting and sometimes surprising. The widespread notion of the third generation trying to reestablish the ethnic identity that the previous generation had tried so hard to leave behind is apparently a myth. Interest in one&rsquo;s European origins can reawaken in members of any generation, but European ethnic identity declines steadily over time. Italians and Irishmen cling to their Europeanness more firmly than others but they, too, eventually melt into the pot.</p>
<p>Another finding that runs counter to popular belief is that an interest in European ethnicity increases with education. Despite the common view that &#8220;working-class ethnics&#8221; are the staunchest remnants of Europe-in-America, according to Professor Alba it is the best educated who cultivate an interest in their European origins.</p>
<p>Professor Alba also reports that it is women who are the guardians of European ethnicity. Without their determination to cook the foods and observe the celebrations of their ancestors, an occasional outburst of European sentiment from the father is unlikely to have much effect on children. Nevertheless, Professor Alba finds that in the case of ethnic intermarriage, when the husband insists on keeping his own ethnicity, his wife is likely to oblige. Swedish wives learn to cook ravioli and English ladies learn Irish jigs to please their husbands. In mixed marriages, children are more likely to identify with only a single ethnicity, and this is likely to be that of the father.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in all cases, Professor Alba&rsquo;s research demonstrates what everyone knows to be true  &mdash;  that European ethnicity is receding dramatically. Americans of European origin now tend to have what can be called &#8220;symbolic&#8221; or &#8220;voluntary&#8221; ethnicity. For the most part, their Europeanness is something that is more a decoration than an essence, and is something they may deny or claim entirely as it suits them. European ethnicity has become so symbolic and so voluntary that virtually any white person can appropriate most any part of it for himself. Professor Alba quotes a notice from an Albany newspaper that sums up what European ethnicity now means in America: &#8220;The German-American Club of Albany will observe St.&nbsp;Patrick&rsquo;s Day with a dinner-dance on March 19.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Professor Alba does not explore this, a similar ethnic merging is taking place among Hispanics and, to a lesser degree, among Asians. Just as the musicians in a &#8220;German&#8221; band are as likely to be English, Irish, or even Czech as they are to be German, the members of a Salsa band may well be a mix of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Central Americans. Despite the current fashion of pooh poohing the melting pot, it has hardly gone out of business; there is simply a separate pot for each race.</p>

    </tr>
</table><p>It is in this context that Professor Alba hazards a few timid observations about a dawning pan-European ethnicity. As non-white immigrants pour into the country, and as old country identifications wane, whites increasingly see that the contours of the new melting-pot identity match those of the frontiers of Europe. Though Professor Alba anticipates a broad European-American ethnicity, he seems to be confused about what this means: &#8220;An attraction of finding common ground as European Americans is that it avoids the obvious pitfalls of a merely racial identity as &#8220;whites&rsquo;.&#8221; Since the &#8220;pitfalls&#8221; of such an identity are so &#8220;obvious,&#8221; Professor Alba never explains what they might be.</p>
<p>We are told that since a European-American identity is made up of the remnants of &#8220;symbolic&#8221; ethnicities, it is likely to be weak. Here again, in trying to distinguish between European-American identity and white consciousness, Professor Alba may be fashionable but he is mistaken. The racial fault lines in this country are only widening. As Poles, Hungarians, and old stock Dutchmen find that their interests are not those of blacks, Hispanics, or Filipinos, it will become increasingly clear that the culture uniting European-Americans cannot easily be separated from race.</p>
<p>Professor Alba is right to acknowledge the decline of old-country ethnicity and has an inkling of what will replace it. But the European-American identity he describes will arrive with far greater strength and with far more consequences than Yale University Press is likely to concede.</p>

<p>Of course! Even the Founding Fathers KNEW this and even stated this Republic was for their PROGENY (White race).</p>
<p> It has always been impossible to unite with blacks, hispanics Orientals if one is of the White nationality. It is also impossible to unite with the half breeds. I have said this for so long and it seems no one listens.</p>
<p>Different White nationalities mixing with each other still makes one of the WHITE race. Mixing with another race makes one not of the White race. It is usually the case where the White partner ALWAYS identifies with the other race and defends that race over their own. Has anyone ever noticed that? </p>
<p> We do know that the offspring of those unions ALWAYS identifies with and defends their darker race side.  </p>

		<p>I like to watch a TV program called European Journal. In my area it is carried by the Buffalo PBS station. It&rsquo;s a half hour show with five segments of five minutes each on current events in various places in Europe. It&rsquo;s like a video magazine and I find it a pleasant way to keep in touch with Europe. </p>

<p>Think of Chelsea Clinton and Caroline Kennedy. Both married Jewish men.</p>
<p>Intermarriage in the U.S. among white folks is not only across &#8220;nationality&#8221; but religion too. And quite successfully. Whites do pretty good at this stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;it will become increasingly clear that the culture uniting European-Americans cannot easily be separated from race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among some whites, THERE IS AN EXISTING RACIAL SOLIDARITY! NOT acknowledged and not as widespread as should be, but it is IS there.</p>

		<p>A certain segment of the white often overweight women has always found it necessary to hook up and be abused by black boyfriends. Nothing will stop this, and frankly the women involved are best gone from the future of European civilization here or in Europe.</p>
<p>More and more educated females, and I&rsquo;ve noticed in college towns or neighborhoods, are dating blacks, some educated and some not. On a much smaller basis I see white men with black women, usually middle class, lighter skinned black women. </p>
<p>There is no way to stop this. The definition of &#8220;white&#8221; may have to be cultural:how does a person behave? What are their values? Where are their loyalties, i.e., to America as it&rsquo;s existed for two hundred fifty years or to an ethnic group like African Americans? (hello Michelle Obama with your despised Princeton degree). </p>
<p>Asian women,many of whom have chosen white mates, seem to be able to bridge the cultural gap. Amazing when you think of the differences between Asia and Europe. But then again, nothing can be further from European civilization than sub Saharan Africa and its continued barbarism, clearly continued in the daily atrocities of our black American communities. </p>
<p>So I say give the bright black women a chance if they sound normal, work hard and want black criminals and federal subsidy feeders put away for a long time. If they meet white academic standards without affirmative action, they earned their way, and if they take up with an Asian or White guy, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>There are a few such women. (Notice I didn&rsquo;t mention black guys. A lost lot, including Prez Hussein, his brother-in-law from Princeton, the black and African majority of the NFL and NBA, and Hussein&rsquo;s buddy &#8220;Prof Have a Beer&#8221; Gates.) And don&rsquo;t forget Spike Lee. The Congressional Black Caucus goes too.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the black women who tumble into a college, white or black, you too back to the Hood. You may look like Beyonce, but can you read a balance sheet, lay off black employees if necessary, and speak several languages, including acceptable business-level English? And how about those inventions? Other than more creative silencers, where are those black inventors since Booker T or was it Carver invented peanut butter? (Chunky or Smooth?)</p>
<p>In our new needed Constitution, we will have an English only requirement, and Ebonics or derivatives thereof, will not qualify. Nor will free, so-called, education be a &#8220;universal&#8221; right. As it is not in most nations.</p>

<p>That is a defeatist attitude and a dangerous one for the White race.  So now, it comes down to &#8220;if they act White&#8221;?  I have not seen ONE black who hooks up with a White partner EVER defend the White race, period! They will always stand by their own. Even the White partner will switch over to their side. Even those with Asian partners do the same.</p>
<p>Why would you promote even more miscegenation and half-breed kids?  You think that will strengthen the White race?</p>

<p>I agree; this is just as much about appearance and background, as it is about behviour. What if we all thought it acceptable to marry blacks, as long as they fit certain cultural standards, then a hundred years down the road we would still be an ugly mix of all the races of the world.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen the &#8220;South Park&#8221; episode about immigrants from the future, where everyone has &#8220;orange skin and speaks a combination of English, Indian, and Dutch,&#8221; then you get an idea of what miscegenation can ultimately lead to, no matter how &#8220;carefully&#8221; it is carried out.</p>

<p>Actually, Like you, I do see a growing number of interracial dating and marriage taking place. Among Black men and White women, it tends to transcend across economic lines, with White men and Black women, the couples ten to be upper income and the woman is sophisitcated and above average in looks.</p>
<p>Another thing, I do not care if my children have Black, Hispanic or other non-White friends. However, I do not want them to marry or have children by any non Whites! Period!</p>

		<p>K-12 government schools also push to deracinate Whites and remove White ethnicity by acknowledging, encouraging and celebrating every non-White cultural holiday, while discouraging, if not eliminating, traditional White American holidays.</p>
<p>For hispanics, it&rsquo;s Cinco de Mayo, which is, believe me, a major celebration in the LA Schools  &mdash;  honored with speeches, special dances, food and more recently, rioting, because blacks feel they are being &#8216;dissed.&rsquo;  When I received my new school calendar a few days ago, I noticed this year, for the first time, that cesar chavez&rsquo;s birthday is now a school holiday.  I assume the final, near-forgotten President&rsquo;s Day has been sacrificed for this new, improved, multi-culti holiday celebrating &#8216;diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Blacks, of course, have an entire month to themselves in February where we ALL are forced to celebrate &#8216;black history and achievements&rsquo;, again with speeches, contests, african dress and awards.  Blacks also have mlk day in January.</p>
<p>It seems we Whites have no holidays any longer to celebrate in Amerika  &mdash;  Easter Vacation is now &#8216;Spring Break&rsquo;, Christopher Columbus Day in October is gone, with CC himself reviled as an evil genocidist, Christmas Vacation is now known as &#8216;Winter Break&rsquo;, Lincoln and Washington&rsquo;s birthdays have been combined into an all-purpose, little-known or celebrated &#8216;Presidents&rsquo; Day&rsquo;, which I believe will soon be eliminated.  Multi-culturalism does not include or acknowledge  White traditions. Not One.</p>
<p>What does this say about how the regime (government, media, academia) views  Whites? </p>
<p>Our history, our culture, our celebrations are being erased and thrown down the memory hole.</p>
<p>This is the precursor to US being erased.</p>

		<p>I may be the only one here to suggest this but I think this country was alot more vibrant and interesting when Whites had distinctive ethnic groups.  I can remember as a kid traveling to the various Little Switzerlands and Germantowns that dot the landscape of this country. It was nice to be immersed in diversity (the good kind) of the various European ethnic groups; the way they looked, the accents, the food, the unique architecture of their communities, etc.  Something very precious has been lost in the homogenization of White America.  The various regional cultures such as in the Midwest, South, and New England appear to be blurring and fading into extinction.     </p>
<p>As a side note, I think a great deal of this miscegenation that everybody keeps talking about is an illusion being fabricated for various reasons.  I suspect some of it is being staged by some kind of anti-racist group or traveling theatre troupe.  Case in point, I live in a small town that is overwhelmingly White and ocassionally I will see a mixed race couple about every six months out in town.  What I find odd is in such a small place you never see the same couple twice.  I&rsquo;ve seen two White male/black female couples in the past 4 years.  Both men looked like catalog models and it is no big exaggeration to say these women were chunky and ghetto.  I could discern there was a wide degree of difference in respect to breeding, intelligence and class between the man and woman.  There&rsquo;s just no way in any kind of bizarro world that these two people would hook up or that this man would have any interest in her.  This is assuming they were a couple and not some guy with his domestic help.  </p>

		<p>I have long believed that most of our public policies concerning non-Whites were shaped by politicians and concerned citizens who mistakenly believed that the words of Emma Lazarus&rsquo; poem that appears on the base of the Statue of Liberty accurately reflect the feelings of America&rsquo;s founding fathers. They don&rsquo;t. <br>
The wise men who guided the grand experiment that became our nation had little use for the wretched refuse of the world. Their plan was to create a confederation of states in which persons of European ancestry could assimilate into one Christian, English-speaking culture and live free of the tyranny of the totalitarian churches and greedy kings of Europe. Their plans did not extend to the huddled masses of ineducable heathens from other regions of the earth who lacked the cognitive skills and other desirable traits which would make them valuable contributors to the new nation. Furthermore, the articles of the original American Constitution did not pertain to the slaves of African ancestry who resided here. At the time our constitution was penned Black slaves were regarded as little more than livestock and, as such, the great words that referred to the inalienable rights of men did not apply to them.<br>
Do you remember the Black clothing brand called &#8220;FUBU&#8221;? The name was an acronym for: For Us By Us. Well, any White person who is truly familiar with the ways of the world during the American Revolution knows that America is the Original FUBU, except in this case we Whites are the &#8220;us&#8221;. We need to start believing that again and we need to make others believe it as well.</p>

		<p>number 7 is wrong about Brazil.</p>
<p>true, it is probably the country with the most racial heterogeneity.</p>
<p>but blacks, the majority, are still at the bottom of society (the same is true of Cuba, whose claims to have achieved racial equality are simply hilarious to anyone who is informed: we were further along in 1920).</p>
<p>as far as I know, the Japanese colony in Brazil remains essentially on next, and so does the German colony.</p>
<p>like some Latin American countries, Brazilians make more and clearer distinctions between blacks, mixed race individuals, etc.</p>
<p>educated, bourgeois, mixed-race Brazilians look upon blacks as their natural inferiors.</p>
<p>one of the most bizarre aspects of race denial in the United States is the refusal to recognize that the black intelligentsia consists primarily of mixed-race individuals, many of whom are primarily white with just enough African heritage (5-10% will do fine) to allow them to play the African-American intellectual on television.</p>
