<h1>Is Ethnic Beauty the New &#8216;It&rsquo; Factor?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liane Membis, CNN, September 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women who desire a more &#8220;exotic&#8221; appearance are looking to the fashion world&rsquo;s growing multi-culturalism for inspiration.</p>
<p>There was a time when the Caucasian girl-next-door looks of Christie Brinkley, Cindy Crawford and more recently Kate Moss dominated the fashion pages. Then came new fashion icons: Naomi Campbell, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce  &mdash;  and then Giselle, Kim Kardashian and Shakira.</p>
<p>More voluptuous figures, fuller lips and darker skin, features traditionally associated with women of African, Latin and Asian cultures, are &#8220;in.&#8221; Over the past decade, an appreciation for ethnic beauty has been on the rise, and these natural features are becoming popular among Caucasian women who desire to look more &#8220;exotic.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Etcoff [Dr. Nancy Etcoff, a Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital psychologist who studies the science behind the brain and beauty], who also authored &#8220;Survival of the Prettiest,&#8221; adds: &#8220;If you study plastic surgery textbooks, the notions of an ideal feature have changed. In the 50s, the ideal look featured thinner lips, upturned noses, smaller eyes, and paler makeup,&#8221; Etcoff said. &#8220;Now you see broader noses, darker skin, and larger eyelids. All these attributes suggest shifts in demographics and an appeal to a more multicultural look instead of an overly Caucasian appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
&#8220;What&rsquo;s not to love, embrace and emulate about ethnic beauty?&#8221; said Us Weekly fashion director Sasha Charnin Morrison. &#8220;The use of curvier, more rounded figures looks refreshing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celebrities and the media, Etcoff said, have helped promote ethnic beauty. One trait in particular is the larger bottom.</p>

<p>Laughably, this is the usual multicultural nonsense mixed with undiluted idiocy, that could only sustain such an unnatural dogma. Of this bunch of unabashed &ldquo;ethnic beauties,&rdquo; only Naomi Campbell comes close to not fully displaying some attempt to have &ldquo;the Caucasian girl-next-door&rdquo; look, and she clearly straightens her hair and does have semi-aquiline and wide eyes that have probably been surgically enhanced. Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce, both try to look as Caucasian as they can as well, with little better success than Naomi Campbell; however, the effort to look white is still clear. Finally, Giselle, Kim Kardashian and Shakira, are all outright Caucasians. Giselle is 100% German and therefore 100% white European, regardless of the fact that she was born in Brazil. Kim Kardashian is Armenian and of Scottish, Dutch, and a bit of Native American ancestry; Shakira is of Lebanese, Spanish, and Italian ancestry. Thus, the last three women are all Caucasians; they may not be Barbie Dolls, but they clearly are not: Africans, Asians, or Latinos.   </p>
<p>Kim Kardashian is a race-mixer mind you, but that does not negate her Caucasian background; it just renders her into a pen of course, with Hugh Heffner as the caller of said pen. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Just a few words here, first off, what rubbish from a so-called expert. &#8220;One trait in particular is the larger bottom&#8221;.. For hippos and elephants that might be alright. White is beautiful, always was, always will be. Plastic surgery ruins looks, not helps them IMO. Also, have a look see at the so-called brainwasher, I mean doctor. Just more White bashing that&rsquo;s really obvious.</p>

		<p>This article is so screwed up that I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with my rant.  I happen to like my &#8220;upturned&#8221; nose and pale skin and don&rsquo;t plan to change a thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that the sales of skin whitening creams, hair relaxers, or blond hair dye will drop off any time soon either.</p>

		<p>Exotics are in? Then why do the wives of the wealthy remain overwhelmingly the northwest european - blonde and blue eyed, or brunette with fair skin, tall and slender and delicate featured - ideal? Of course, men will &#8220;settle&#8221; for exotics, but alphas don&rsquo;t have to&hellip;and don&rsquo;t.   </p>

		<p>Not favoring the exotic ethnics, I was prone to &#8220;act stupidly&#8221; today in the ongoing effort to &#8220;increase the intensity&#8221; at making &#8220;dangerous discoveries&#8221;.</p>
<p>On TV, the updated Cat in the Hat cartoon starred a very White blonde girl, Sally, with a cute little nose, and her closest companion, Nick, who was some sort of  mulatto mongrel mixed brownish color, with a wide nose, thankfully, and wool of somewhat unnaturally relaxed kink.  Most offensive was his imitation White accent.  If White girls must be surrounded by blacks, please at least do us the courtesy of having the blacks speak in their native Ebonics.  </p>
<p>The message to White Children today is that you must have Diversity surrounding you at all times, otherwise, you are a raciss hate criminal neo Nazi Klu Kluxer. When young children are constantly fed these multicultural images and diversity pressures, they will reach a point where if they don&rsquo;t have a black or brown friend, they will feel that something is missing from their lives. They will feel an anxiety to always embrace change and transcend boundaries.  Good luck with that future case of syphilis and HIV, Sally, my dear.</p>
<p>To try and clear my head from that offense, I went to eat at a restaurant that is always at least 90% White, which is the best you can do in this &#8220;vibrant, safe, diverse&#8221; city.  When I got there, it was 100% White, and I was overjoyed at my blessings.  But blacks have an uncanny sense of when White Humanity is enjoying life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness without black supervision and interference, so of course, it wasn&rsquo;t long, almost immediately, that a huge, hulking, lurking, scowling black showed up on the previously secure scene.  My blessings were ruined, I was made miserable, and the Civil Rights struggle claimed another White victim in the names of Rosa Liar Parks and Michael King Fake Reverend. </p>
<p> Blacks are taught that is their duty to prevent Whites from developing &#8220;unhealthy White identities,&#8221; and thus must have blacks around them always. They also believe that through forced Diversity Treatments, they will put us through a de-Nazification, much as the Germans were forced to endure after their war, all meted out at the hands of  enemies and oppressors.  We suffer the same fate today as the Germans did then.  Read what Savitri Devi felt about de-Nazification, and you will see how you should feel about the Diversity Curse.</p>
<p>But I did see today a couple of throw backs to better days: White mothers with their beautiful White babies.    I shouted for joy, &#8220;Thank you for not choosing a black to help you make your children!&#8221; </p>
<p>Whenever you see a White mother and White child, remember that you are witnessing a courageous stand against mongrelization of White Humanity.  Those courageous White women are refusing to be intimidated by charges of &#8220;raciss&#8221; when they make their White babies. They earn our undying esteem, and their renown will extend throughout our communities. These women of ours refuse to be shamed by the &#8220;Making White Babies is a Hate Crime against Humanity&#8221; charge.  They are grandly defiant and thoroughly in Order. Their resistance to mongrelization is a blessing to God and a righteous elemental instinct.  </p>
<p>We must ask them, &#8220;What are you doing exactly to make sure that your White daughter will be as courageous, distinguished, esteemed, and renowned as you are? What can you do to make sure her child and your granddaughter is never highlighted on CNN for serving the perverts&rsquo; hunger for seeing the Diversity Curse broadcast into their living rooms?&#8221;</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity- Embrace Whiteness- Beware and Prepare!  You know what&rsquo;s coming next. How will you explain it to your children?<br>

<p>Since when are Asian women &#8220;voluptuous&#8221;? Most are more petite than the average white woman.</p>
<p>When they say the &#8220;ethnic&#8221; look is in they mean kind of like a tanned white woman with hips who is not anorexic. As a man, I have no problem with that. And there will be some Hispanics, Asians and Arabs who do have that look.</p>

<p>The white ones are looking better and better, and frankly I&rsquo;m sick and tired of seeing people all around me nowadays who aren&rsquo;t white. It&rsquo;s annoying to pass, while walking on the street, one after another dusky double-digit IQ type blabbering on a cellphone or listening to an i-pod when you know they&rsquo;ve contributed absolutely nothing to technological advancement or anything else that once made this country great.</p>

		<p>This is hilarious! GISELLE BUNCHEN is a non-White exotic beauty? Try again, genius.  She&rsquo;s a GERMAN by blood that was born in Brazil.  There are large populations of Germans and Italians in Brazil, fortunately, the entire country is not made up of ambiguous mongrels.  It&rsquo;s about 1/3 White  &mdash;   who do you think runs the country?  </p>
<p>Even when the lamestream media tries really hard, they fall back on holding up Whites as supposed mestizos.  Earth to PC police: all the latina models are WHITE and a few of them might have negligible amounts of Indian blood (but not enough to make them ugly).  Have you ever watched Univision?  Are the starlets 5&rsquo; brown peasants, or are they 5&rsquo; 10&#8221; European beauties?</p>

<p>There is more than one type of beauty. How, then, is it surprising that people get bored of one type over time and then a different type becomes popular? Trends rise and fall. Just because the current falling trend is the white standard of beauty doesn&rsquo;t make the article white-bashing for pointing it out. Reality is not always flattering.</p>

		<p>Liane Membis&rsquo; article presents no evidence that women&rsquo;s magazines are shifting away from European looking models for their cover girls.  Membis&rsquo;s article presents no evidence that men&rsquo;s magazines like Playboy are doing so with their centerfold models.

Whites MUST not only build-up our numbers,but take the utmost care in producing the best possable offspring as well.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but most of the ethnic &#8220;beauty&#8221; you see in the media is centered on features garnered from white genetics.  For decades white models have attempted to see how close to skeletal they could become without having clothes slide off of them.  It was disgusting and became the norm in high fashion.  But normal white women have all of the features claimed to be predominately &#8220;ethnic&#8221; (as if white is not an ethnicity at all to these people).  CNN is once again trying to stir a nonexistent pot.  No amount of media brainwashing is going to ever convince the world that white women take a back seat on beauty.  If that was the case, don&rsquo;t they think minorities might pass on white women instead of seeking and harassing them?<br>

<p>This entire thesis is not about &#8220;appreciating&#8221; beauty in non-whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about trying to flim flam readers into believing that beauty isn&rsquo;t really beauty and it is something that can change over time and circumstances, childishly thinking&hellip;on the author&rsquo;s part&hellip;. that public preferences and human instincts can be altered simply by putting forth a concept the author wants people to believe.</p>
<p>This story was not for the purpose of reporting truthful information.  It was for the purpose of trying to create a different concept regarding beauty in women, probably because of black hatred toward white women for being so pretty.  This isn&rsquo;t liked by the above Lian Membis who probably is a black with a big butt, and thinks all she has to do is lie about something and that will make her lie reality.</p>
<p>Blacks do this constantly, not with just points like this, but everything.  If they&rsquo;re not lying about the Roman senate being 1/3 black, their lying about the ancient Egyptians being black, rather than Egyptian slaves as they surely were.  It&rsquo;s painful for them to realize they&rsquo;re the most unattractive race on earth, and the only race that has ZERO accomplishments so they lyingly seek to try to convince people of the opposite of reality. <br>
Determination of beauty is an intuitive thing that is recognized instantly by humans and not something that changes, because some unattractive black or other non-white wants it too.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful women in other races, but white women by far have the greatest numbers, and, like everything else, black lies or childish psychological attempts to alter reality aren&rsquo;t going to change a thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I question whether the truth is that many of you actually see the appeal of ethnic beauty but don&rsquo;t want to admit it, hence the defensiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with beauty in women among non-whites, nor failing or reluctant to recognize it.  You&rsquo;re misconstruing  the point entirely.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Just because the current falling trend is the white standard of beauty doesn&rsquo;t make the article white-bashing for pointing it out.&#8221;  </p>
<p>There is no &#8220;falling trend,&#8221; but you would love it if people believed that, wouldn&rsquo;t you? </p>
<p>&#8220;Reality is not always flattering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s why this article was written.  The author&hellip;and you&hellip;stupidly want us to believe a reality that doesn&rsquo;t exist, because the reality is that blacks have nothing if they don&rsquo;t lie. <br>

		<p>&#8220;I think that Christie Brinkly and Cindy Crawford I.Q. is significantly higher than a Naomi Campbell.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Cynthia Ann Crawford was valedictorian at her high school, and she studied chemical engineering at Illinois&rsquo;s Northwestern University.</p>
<p>And of course, since she is White, she did all that by showing talent and working hard, because there was no affirmative action for her.</p>

		<p>This article has it all so backwards it is laughable.  Blacks, Latins, and Asians were just recently the focus of articles about how detrimental attempting to look like white women was to their mental health, physical health, as well as their pocket books.  And of course, the subliminal blame was laid on white women for being &#8220;unfairly&#8221; attractive.  I have known of many cases where attractive white women are attacked in schools and even later as young adults, simply because they are attractive.  </p>
<p>Regardless of the fashion world, that is in the business of attempting to foist new silliness onto the rest of the world, successful men, from OJ to Tiger, to King Hussein of Jordan&rsquo;s fourth wife, Queen Noor, an American born blonde and Kofi Anan (and his son&rsquo;s) blonde Swedish wife, the current Indian obsession with white women, sexually exploitive Japanese Haini cartoons, where white girls are the objects of torment and sexual abuse, the proof of an unhealthy (for the white women and the white race) obsession with white beauty is plain.  Ridiculous attempts to supplant it, is a temporary fashion and political maneuver.  But the only way to protect whites from their own beauty is for whites to raise their children in full conscienous of the larger world that is waiting to ravage them.</p>

		<p>#18&rsquo;s comment is ridiculous because she starts out with an ad hominem comparing those with whom she disagrees to &#8220;cornered animals&#8221;. And then follows it up with assertions that those who disagree with her secretly harbor a secret attraction. Where have I heard that argument before? Oh, yes. Militant homosexuals use the same tactic when they say &#8220;homophobes&#8221; secretly harbor homosexual tendencies. But neither of those claims are true. Those using them are simply counting on the revulsion to the allegation to shock their critics into silence. </p>
<p>But the thing that makes your argument even more ridiculous is that we&rsquo;re constantly hearing blacks claim the fashion industry discriminates against them and that even black models tend not to be representative. And now Etcoff is basically saying the exact opposite. </p>
<p>There is a reason the fashion industry has suddenly started showing a few tokens. And its the same reason a few designers have started using &#8220;fatties&#8221;. It&rsquo;s to shut their critics up. But don&rsquo;t insult us by saying we are secretly attracted to something like <i>this</i>. Because it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>

		<p>Beautifully written article below. </p>
<p>The female celebrities of our age are the likes of the slatternly Cheryl Cole, the tattooed and substance dependant Amy Winehouse and the largely bionic Katie Price, women whom a generation earlier would have been lucky to appear in the red lighted windows of Amsterdam or the Reeperbahn, if in Europe at all, rather than the front pages of children&rsquo;s magazines.</p>
<p>Today, little girls play with dolls called Bratz, which appear to represent mixed race, botox enhanced, re-pubescent sluts in minuscule, buttocks exposing, skirts, and nobody views that as unhealthy. From an early age, the next generation of women are being taught to admire females who are one step up from being backstreet hookers, some less than a step, and informed that the ultimate female ambition is to be a pelmet skirted executive at work, and a slapped up gangsta&rsquo;s Ho at home.</p>
<p>I used to think that the type of girl who fell for the &ldquo;spread your legs and show your power&rdquo; school of feminism were victims of cynical male voyeurs, but I now suspect that the aims behind it are more sinister than that, can it be that those who seek our downfall believe that by turning the sort of people who our parents would have viewed as the lowest of the low in to social icons, they can undermine the values which built our society&hellip;</p>

		<p>I laugh at what is passed off as exotic beauties these days. To me,  a Slavic woman with long hair, blue, green or gray eyes and all the right curves in the right places is beyond compare. The same is true of ladies of Celtic ancestry, and clear, white skin is a mark of beauty. While some Asian women are incredibly beautiful too, I prefer Caucasian women for many reasons, starting  with the fact I feel our race is dying out and the only way to preserve it is to have enough children to perpetuate it.</p>

		<p>The above article is just more multicultural propaganda from the Communist News Network (CNN). In truth, almost all of the &#8220;exotic&#8221; women who are glorified and idolized in pop-culture look like white women with very deep tans. Non-whites know that white women are the most beautiful in the world and that&rsquo;s why they prefer their women to look as close to ours as possible. Case in point, most Latin American beauty queens and actresses have fair skin and Caucasian features, often with blonde hair and green or blue eyes. I was watching a Korean soap opera with English subtitles a while back and virtually all the actors had long narrow noses and light skin with minimal folds over their eyes. With sunglasses on the actors could have almost passed for white if it was not for the fact that they had high cheek bones. Bollywood has the same fetish with light skin as Latin America. Many of their actresses could &#8216;pass&rsquo; for Italians! <br>

<p>You have got to be kidding me right? Did you take a survey of every nonwhite to arrive at that assertion?</p>
<p>I am an east asian man and do NOT find white women beautiful or attractive at all from the likes of Marilyn Monroe to Gisele Bundchen. Other asian men I know feel the same way. I won&rsquo;t elaborate the reasons lest I hurt some feelings here. </p>
<p>One of the major problems with white nationalism I see is this pattern of one-upmanship (hint: i am better/prettier than you). It&rsquo;s just plain silly/stupid in light of the fact that white nationalists are attempting to secure some future for their race.</p>
<p>In other words, why would any far-sighted white nationalist promote the image that white women are the most beautiful, the most emulated, meanwhile denigrate nonwhites as ugly? Do you want &#8220;ugly&#8221; nonwhite males to chase &#8220;beautiful&#8221; white women and breed with them? What kind of future are you trying to secure?</p>
<p>As an east asian man who only finds full-blooded east asian women attractive, you won&rsquo;t see me bragging to the world how great asian women are and rubbing it in to the non-asians (like some comments I&rsquo;m reading here). It reeks of insecurity and it&rsquo;s just not smart&hellip;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true at all. I&rsquo;m looking at the data. Yes, black women get the lowest average reply rate (34.3), but white women are next lowest (42.1) followed by Native American women (42.3), Hispanic women (42.5), Indian women (42.7), Asian women (43.7), Other women (44.4), Pacific Islander women (46.0) and Middle Eastern women (49.5).</p>

<p>White women come 8th out of 9 places, Asian women come 4th. 1st place goes to Middle Eastern women, by a significant margin too. I wonder if you are now going to dismiss this data as &#8216;multicultural propaganda&rsquo; as well. Which would be strange, considering you were the one citing it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I question whether the truth is that many of you actually see the appeal of ethnic beauty but don&rsquo;t want to admit it, hence the defensiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m White and am attracted to Whites but I agree that there is beauty in all races and don&rsquo;t mind seeing different races in fashion. What I find annoying however is the way &#8220;ethnic&#8221; beauty is pushed excessively in majority White countries. It&rsquo;s one more subtle way of pushing White culture aside. In majority non-White countries, you don&rsquo;t see other races excessively pushed over the majority culture. In Asia for example, most people in fashion or most models are Asian though you occasionally see others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am an east asian man and do NOT find white women beautiful or attractive at all from the likes of Marilyn Monroe to Gisele Bundchen&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is fully understandable as everyone has their own idea of beauty and  most people of any race are  attracted to those of their own race. </p>

<p>Because, generally speaking, it&rsquo;s true.  My question to you is why do you refuse to accept that?</p>
<p>On another topic, let me say this:  You came to this country, because your own was a failed society and it was that way, because the people there do not have the ability to construct a first rate civilization, yet the first thing those like you do when you feel secure in this country is brag about how great yours is/was, and you insult us with vulgar names for being honest.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with staying in your own country and trying to better it instead of coming here?  How you view us or our women means very little, because you belong to a failed people who can achieve nothing of any significance of your own.  And, yes, I&rsquo;m sorry to have to say so, but your race, overall, is ugly. </p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; nonwhite males to chase &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; white women and breed with them? What kind of future are you trying to secure?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, we want ugly non-whites to go home and live where their ancestors lived.</p>
<p>The unchecked inundation of third world non-whites into this country has brought it to the brink of civil war, 24/7, especially now that Western economies, especially the US one, is on the brink of an unavoidable depression that will have all the tribes in the US fighting each other for their share of bread.  Will you be glad you came here when the fighting begins in earnest?</p>
<p>And if you think what I say isn&rsquo;t true, all you have to do is wait until the end of this year or the first of the next and it will be obvious that we are heading for economic collapse and breakup to anyone with the intelligence to see.</p>
<p>The best argument in the world is one that can almost immediately give a living example of what it purports to be true.  If you don&rsquo;t believe what I say, can you believe what your eyes show you?</p>

<p>Not really surprising. Colombia and Venezuela (which are basically non-white countries)  are famous for their international beauty queens.  All of them white!  Some of the best looking people I&rsquo;ve ever seen were in Colombia   &mdash;   members of the all-white upper class. These people, over the generations, have obviously been very particular about whom they marry.  In Peru, it was explained to me by a woman of Scottish ancestry (named Stewart!) that the upper class, particularly the British and the Germans, do not marry outside their race, contrary to the general national custom of mixing.</p>
