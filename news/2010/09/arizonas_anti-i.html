			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Klawonn, Time, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donations from people like Acheson [Robert Acheson of Dixfield, Maine] have fed the political frenzy surrounding illegal immigration and framed key Arizona debates {snip}. Having people outside of Arizona&rsquo;s borders help shape its border policy may be one of the state&rsquo;s great political ironies.</p>
<p>{snip} In response to criticism that the law [Senate Bill 1070] would promote racial profiling, Brewer created a legal defense fund to give the cops some cover. Now the fund has more than $2 million, a Brewer spokeswoman says, and much of that is coming from people outside Arizona. In-state contributors have accounted for $320,544, according to data on AZcentral.com. Contributions from California, Texas, Florida, New York, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Virginia have accounted for $703,171  &mdash;  outspending Arizonans by more than 2 to 1. And that excludes money from the rest of the country, because people from all 50 states have donated.</p>
<p>Although more Arizonans have donated to the fund than residents of any other state, they have been eclipsed in per-capita giving. In-state contributors have given an average of $50.76 per person, while donors from Alaska, Wyoming and Hawaii have given $57.97, $55.83 and $52.05 per person, respectively. {snip}</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the only signs of outside influence in Arizona&rsquo;s illegal-immigration debate or in the political fortunes of its candidates. On Aug. 11, almost two weeks before Arizona&rsquo;s primary election, Sheriff Arpaio turned in campaign-finance reports that showed he had pulled in $480,669 over the summer, bringing his total to $2.3 million. Arpaio&rsquo;s campaign manager Chad Willems says the last official number-crunch they did on the numbers was six months ago, and at that time, 26% of the money was coming from Arizonans. The rest was from out of state. {snip}</p>
<p>The fundraising looks more like a major congressional campaign than a stumpfest for a local sheriff&rsquo;s office, and it&rsquo;s even more astonishing considering Arpaio is not up for re-election until 2012. He spent much of the new funds on advertising that pummeled his political opponents  &mdash;  even if they weren&rsquo;t running against him. Interim Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, a Vietnam veteran and moderate Republican who has often clashed with Arpaio, says the attack ads cost him his job and run counter to donors&rsquo; intentions for the money. &#8220;But the real factor was that I believe he illegally used the money to influence this election,&#8221; Romley says. &#8220;It was really a fraud on the people who gave to his re-election campaign.&#8221; County election officials agree. They ruled against Arpaio&rsquo;s use of the election funds for the attack ads, fined his campaign and, last week, gave his campaign 20 days to produce more documentation of the expenditures. The Arpaio campaign is appealing the ruling.</p>

		<p>This is why magazines like &#8220;Time&#8221; are dying.  Everyone knows the vast majority of the white middle class in Arizona are strongly opposed to the Mexican invasion of their state.  Yet magazines like &#8220;Time&#8221; imply the uproar is due more to donations from Maine and Alaska than a widespread concern that Arizona will eventually become the third-world.  </p>
<p>Our media have become a complete joke.  We&rsquo;re fast becoming like the former Eastern Bloc countries where everything printed is a lie and everyone knows it&rsquo;s a lie.</p>

<p>What I find very amusing and a bit ironic, is that Comrade Klawonn sees &ldquo;sinister forces&rdquo; from across the country at work here when it comes to donations from outside the state supporting this, but I bet he never said a peep when it came to the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; outside boycotts against Arizona over this issue. How odd and unexpected!</p>
<p>With this issue and in the current economic crisis we are in, I think the forces of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; and multiculturalism may have finally reached their Stalingrad moment. Moreover, this crippling meat grinder that is progressively processing their rainbow hopes and Red dreams into inedible sausages, holds a secondary irony; this being the fact, that it is their mulatto &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; that is the one cranking the handle on it. One can almost tangibly feel the fear oozing out of the &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; these days, simply because they now hold almost total power and it is predictably turning this country into a Third World dystopia.</p>
<p>The dreams of his father, the one their King held, and their own, are all the products of idiocy and/or madness!</p>
<p>What more to say?</p>
<p>Well, may God let it be so!!! </p>

		<p>Hawaiians giving big donations to enforce the Arizona immigration law is very interesting.  I actually would expect them to give the least given the racial make up of the state.  Another noteworthy observation is states with overwhelmingly white populations except Wyoming did not give as much as those with large non-white and racially mixed populations.  I guess if it&rsquo;s not in their backyard white people don&rsquo;t care.  Once these white Pleasantvilles are destroyed they will care.</p>

		<p>No, the &#8220;frenzy&#8221; has been fueled by the leftist news media that has made a huge deal out of nothing-that is the right of a nation to defend its&rsquo; borders and the right of officials to check one&rsquo;s papers, something most nations around the world, including Mexico, already have. </p>

		<p><i>Time</i> makes a big deal of the pro-AZ cause funded by people in other states.  The real scandal is that the anti-AZ effort is being funded by hostile forces from other countries   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve said on this medium ever since 1070 passed that one should follow the opposition&rsquo;s money, and find Hispanic drug gangs, the Muslim Middle East and George Soros on the other side.</p>

		<p>Arizona is the first-line defense against illegal immigration into this country. Helping Arizona helps the whole USA. Why should other Americans stand by while Arizona is overrun? They&rsquo;d be next.</p>

		<p>Harvard-educated foreign service officer, David Timmins, now retired, illustrates what&rsquo;s at stake in the Obama administration&rsquo;s battle with Arizona in &ldquo;Mexicans migrate to &lsquo;their land,&rsquo;&rdquo; (Deseret Morning News, Salt Lake City, April 19, 2006)<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2695q6w" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2695q6w</a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexicans see the Western U.S. as part of Mexico that was stolen from them 150 years ago. They believe this with all their heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived in Mexico 20 years ago, and during that time I reported without much attention being paid in Washington on the evolving Mexican government policy of passively promoting illegal immigration as part of a deliberate and long-range strategy to regain control of the border and mountain states it lost during the Mexican War of 1847-48.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;I was visiting the Museum of National History in Mexico City where I observed a class of perhaps 40 10-year-old school kids sitting on the ground in front of a huge mosaic map that was labeled &#8216;Mexico Integral,&rsquo; or &#8216;Greater Mexico.&rsquo; Their teacher expounded on how the Norteamericanos stole half of Mexico in 1847. The map showed Mexico to include Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, California, most of Idaho, and Oregon and Washington up to the Alaska panhandle.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Referring to the large numbers of Mexicans streaming into the United States and to the Anglos who once streamed into Texas, California, and the rest of the Southwest:</p>
<p>&#8220;They have an undeclared policy to retake by infiltration what they lost by infiltration.&#8221; <br>

		<p>So who cares if alot of money to support Arizona is coming from out of state. There is more at stake here then just what is happening in AZ. Numerous states have their own problems with illegal invaders and of course this money is given voluntary. Unlike the federal government that takes our money and then uses it to wage war upon us for not going along with it&rsquo;s dictates.</p>

<p>Excuse me, idiot, but don&rsquo;t you realize that donations from out- of-state are not at ALL the same thing as the federal government forcing Arizona to let illegal immigrants run free and wild? I don&rsquo;t see how this Comrade Klawonn makes a connection between the two.</p>

		<p>It began in 1946, Americans were told to have fewer children. We complied and as the birth rate for Whites went sharply downward the birth rate for Hispanics and Blacks rose. What is going on is nothing short of a RECONQUISTA and the sad part is the Federal Misgovernment is their ally. If the white race does not raise it&rsquo;s birth rate it does not matter anyway, the land will be populated by the race that has the most children.</p>
