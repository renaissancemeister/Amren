<h1>Feds Spent $800,000 of Economic Stimulus on African Genital-Washing Program</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Cover, Cybercast News Service, September 13, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), spent $823,200 of economic stimulus funds in 2009 on a study by a UCLA research team to teach uncircumcised African men how to wash their genitals after having sex.</p>
<p>The genitalia-washing program is part of a larger $12-million UCLA study examining how to better encourage Africans to undergo voluntary HIV testing and counseling  &mdash;  however, only the penis-washing study received money from the 2009 economic stimulus law. The washing portion of the study is set to end in 2011.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because AIDS researchers have been unsuccessful in convincing most adult African men to undergo circumcision, the UCLA study proposes to determine whether researchers can develop an after-sex genitalia-washing regimen that they can then convince uncircumcised African men to follow.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Entitled &#8220;Community-Based HIV VCT: South Africa,&#8221; the name of the broader umbrella project, the program plans to test how well received the penis-washing regimen is among South African men.</p>
<p>If most of the men in the study wash their genitals after sex, are willing to do so after the study ends, and report that their partners accept the regimen, the researchers will develop another study to see if the &#8220;penile cleansing procedure&#8221; actually works to prevent HIV infections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s lead investigator Dr. Thomas J. Coates was the fourth highest-funded researcher in the country in 2002 and is currently conducting HIV research on three continents.</p>
<p>CNSNews.com asked both Coates and NIMH the following question: &#8220;The Census Bureau says the median household income in the United States is $52,000. How would you explain to the average American mom and dad  &mdash;  who make $52,000 per year  &mdash;  that taxing them to pay for this grant was justified?&#8221;</p>
<p>Coates, who was unavailable for comment, directed CNSNews.com to ask grant-related questions of his assistant, Darya Freedman, who did not respond.</p>
<p>The NIMH also declined to respond to CNSNews.com&rsquo;s question.<br>

		<p>It could be worse:  About five years ago, I read a story that stated that some American government agency spent some six-figure amount to help facilitate was was essentially a black superstitious ritual about how to cure AIDS:  It involved men having to get completely naked, chain themselves together, and shower with some sort of &#8220;magic water.&#8221;  Women were allowed to keep their bottom panties on, though they had to be topless.  I thought to myself   &mdash;   That had to be some clever holy AIDS-curing water, such that the drops know the gender of the person it landed on, and whether the person of the particular gender was in the right state of undress.</p>
<p>The country was either Ethiopia or Eritrea.  </p>
<p>Then again, just who are we to argue with black science?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just in Africa.  Get a load of this:</p>

<p>We all like to make jokes about &#8220;underwater basket weaving,&#8221; as a metaphor for easy college courses, especially those that only seem to be available to certain scholarship athletes of certain hues playing certain sports.  I predict that &#8220;Showering 101&#8221; will soon become one of those.</p>

		<p>So they will waste all this money teaching, ahhh&hellip; hygene to Africans&hellip; and then, if they seem to learn, they will pay more to develop a study to see if it really works? Talk about throwing good money after bad&hellip;.<br>
Also if &#8220;washing&#8221; were the only problem, what of African-Americans, who for the most part have a comparatively higher level of personal grooming than their counterparts in the &#8220;Motherland&#8221; but are still infected at far higher rates than whites of comparative risk?</p>

		<p>Good Grief!  Teaching these Africans how to clean themselves??? After thousands of years and all the missionaries and White do-gooders going to Africa all these hundreds of years and they haven&rsquo;t learned anything? </p>
<p>Spending taxpayer dollars to do it?  Wonder if they are going to teach the African women anything about hygiene also? I am sure they need some lessons with the taxpayer dollars on how to go about it also&hellip;bet it will not do any good whatsoever just as everything else has failed trying to teach these people anything productive.</p>

		<p>Our government doesn&rsquo;t care about you or your family.  Our government considers YOU an inexhaustible source of income (taxes) from which they can pay their salaries, take their trips, dole out favors to their family and friends, and run around the entire world trying out their insane ideas.  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter   &mdash;   from lack of out-houses in Pakistan to improper genital-washing in Africa, no amount of YOUR money is too much to spend to solve all the world&rsquo;s problems.  </p>

Well, no, that wouldn&rsquo;t work in Africa. <br>
 <br>
So then, it would have to be incorporated into some sort of religious mumbo-jumbo, as with Islam, where superstition requires certain rote proceedures to be followed, or else Allah will get you.</p>

		<p>Stimulus money, eh?  I guess that&rsquo;s the only kind of &#8220;stimulus&#8221; blacks understand.<br>
But how many JOBS were created with the almost million bucks?  Count - two.<br>
The researcher, and his assistant.  So likely two, unless money was payed out to the <br>
test subjects to persuade them to undergo the awful and painful fondling necessary.<br>
Do you notice how all this stimulus money seems to wind up in black hands?  Black car dealers or dealers in black areas get money.  White dealers or dealerships in white areas, closed.  Black mortgage bailouts.  Black banks and small businesses.  If it&rsquo;s black, it gets money.  If it&rsquo;s white, it doesn&rsquo;t.  Do you understand NOW why there is so much stimulus money unspent?  Not all that many black businesses around.  And, of course, the corrupt Black Caucus and other pols are waiting long enough to believe we aren&rsquo;t looking before they raid it for their own pockets.  Oh wait!  Many of the Black congressional caucus have ALREADY raided it on behalf of themselves.<br>
Jumped the gun, they did.  Goes to show you, even in corruption blacks are stupid and whites are smarter.</p>

<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m against circumcision. To me, it&rsquo;s like saying we can potentially end breast cancer if we remove breast tissue from young girls. Nature gave men foreskin and unless there&rsquo;s a problem in adulthood, they should keep them. Personally, I see it as a form of society sanctioned child abuse. I don&rsquo;t care what circumcision MIGHT POTENTIALLY prevent. If an adult wants the procedure, that&rsquo;s there choice.</p>
<p>As for this program, the researchers seem to be grasping at straws. &#8216;IF we can get African man to wash themselves after sex, THEN we&rsquo;ll start another study to see if our theory has any validity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I guess they gave up trying to get African men to get married and remain monogamous (or even use condoms). That would end the transmission of HIV.</p>

<p>Not  quite true,  given  that  the  areas  of the  world where  libertine  attitudes  towards sex  are  coupled  with  minimal  circumcision  or  handbooks  and  &#8220;recommendations&#8221; as  to  post-coital practices  have very low  HIV  transmission  rates  &mdash;  no worse  than  other  areas.  I  am referring  to  the  nations  of Scandinavia.</p>

<p>I know you were being sarcastic, but this is EXACTLY what our government has spent our money on.  When I visited Papua New Guinea in 1983, there was an on-going campaign to teach the &#8220;Nationals&#8221; how to use outhouses and wipe afterwords, instead of defecating in the rivers, which caused problems for drinkers downstream.  Cartoon posters written in pidgin were in all the villages showing how to &#8220;Go im straight long hole, tasol.&#8221; and &#8220;Klen um gut as belong you.&#8221;    &mdash;   i.e., Go straight into the hole, that&rsquo;s all. </p>

		<p>Every race and every ethnic group has their own customs.  This is called &#8216;Diversity&#8221; and is our Greatest Strength!  We have no right to try to remake Africans in our own image.  It is both arrogant and reprehensible to think that we have the right to tell Africans how their culture should be.  </p>
<p>Set those people free!  Let them live their lives the way they want.  We have been over there for 300 years telling those people how to live.  Stop sticking our noses where they don&rsquo;t belong, and stop spending my tax money to do it. </p>

		<p>I cringed when I read that the prostitute involved with the Duke Lacrosse party was, upon arrest, found to have been the recipient of 5 different Black proteinaceous donations.  What white person could even stay in the same room with people like that.</p>
<p>A friend, whose Physician father had a large IM practice in Los Angeles during the 50s, 60s and 70s,  told me that has father would say &#8220;Whites will never understand how promiscuous Blacks are&#8221;.  I wish that I had the opportunity to ask him questions but the father is deceased and the son is very liberal.</p>
<p>This brief article brings to mind several of the maligned sterotypesof the Black sub-cultue.  The presentable Blacks that are allowed to have national coverage in the U.S. do not reflect the cultural and genetic horrors that exist in the dark inner-city.<br>
Tours, using reinforced vehicles and procedures modeled after the jeep excursions though African wildlife parks, which sought out these denizens of our great cities would be lucrative. Resistance amoung the objects of study would be confusing and even helpful to the Tours bottom line.  The Jerry Springer Show demonstrated that these fascinating people can handle it because of ludicrously high self-asteem, no embarrasment,baseless pride, spontaneous showmanship and a puzzling low level of self-awareness. </p>

		<p>The whole exercise is  just sheer Western  voyeurism under  the  dubious  guise  of science.  In fact, Africans  bathe  much  more  often than  Europeans.  This was noted  by  European  travellers  to  Africa  during colonial  times  and  before  that  by  trans-Saharan  Arab  travellers.</p>
