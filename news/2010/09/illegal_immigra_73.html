<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A fire that blackened nearly 900 acres in San Diego County was caused by illegal immigrants who were apparently lost and set off a signal fire.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities said they were still trying to find those who sparked the blaze. The illegal immigrants had called Mexican officials &#8220;and advised them that they had been lost for two days, were stranded, dehydrated and were going to light a signal fire to attempt to get some help,&#8221; Cal Fire spokeswoman Roxanne Provaznik told Fox 5 San Diego.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigators from Cal Fire and the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service determined that there was evidence near the area of origin [of the blaze] of illegal aliens traveling through that area, which supports this report,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Oh, the poor things!  How could any Evil White Racist be so Xenophobic and Hatefully Bigoted as to harden his heart against such suffering?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The illegal immigrants had called Mexican officials &ldquo;and advised them that they had been lost for two days, were stranded, dehydrated and were going to light a signal fire to attempt to get some help.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Wait a minute.  These impoverished migrants, who can&rsquo;t make an honest peso in their own country and only want to come to the US to do the menial jobs amerikans won&rsquo;t do&hellip;have cell phones?<br>

		<p>The setting of forest fires has been used by illegal gangs to thwart aerial surveillance of the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>When the Chinese communist troops moved south to fight the UN forces in Korea, 1950, they did the same thing. Set forest fires of biblical proportions to render UN aerial surveillance useless. </p>
<p>Some folks arer just so smart!</p>

<p>If the truth were known, I&rsquo;m pretty sure a large number of the forest fires in the West could be traced back to illegals, many of them on purpose.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve observed increasing numbers of large (dozens in a &#8220;family&#8221;) Hispanic family gatherings at picnic and outdoor grill facilities in my area. Aside from speaking exculusively Spanish, an odd choice for people who claim to at least have green cards and to be Americans just like us, I notice that there is garbage (and small kids) near the grill fires, and often no effort to put out the fires when the mob leaves the once-clean area. The white park maintenance and ranger personnel have to clean up after these &#8220;guests&#8221; and put out any fires. </p>

		<p>Most Mexicans have little or no appreciation of nature or its conservation.  Yet most people who call themselves &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; believe in unlimited immigration from Mexico.  Just another example of leftist idiocy.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;signal&#8221; fire in bone-dry, late-summer SoCal, and these illegals can&rsquo;t be bothered to make a rock-lined fire pit and clear the area around it?</p>
<p>The dry tinder they would have access to this time of year burns quite cleanly, but for a signal fire to be effective, one needs wet wood to produce volumes of smoke.</p>
<p>This one utterly fails a reality check unless one assumes that the perps were complete and total idiots who were completely unconcerned with the possible consequences of their becoming trapped in the middle of the major conflagration they actually started.  Accordingly, I am calling this one a deliberate arson; they set a major fire on purpose and then bugged out.</p>
