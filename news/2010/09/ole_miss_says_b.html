<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ole Miss students and alumni are hotly divided, struggling to find a new mascot replacing antebellum plantation caricature Colonel Reb, school officials say.</p>
<p>{snip} but allegiance to Colonel Reb is as divided as the old North and South, The New York Times reported Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no more of a noble cause than continuing the tradition of Colonel Reb,&#8221; said Levi West, Colonel Reb&rsquo;s doppelganger. &#8220;Everyone loves the guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are new times, we need a new image. But we also just need a mascot,&#8221; said Ellison Brown, 21, an African-American junior from Jackson.</p>
<p>As far as merchandising goes, this summer Ole Miss announced a ban on the sale of anything with Colonel Reb&rsquo;s image on it {snip}.</p>
<p>Colonel Reb diehards are not going quietly into the southern night and a group of them have gathered 2,000 signatures on a petition against a new mascot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over. My. Dead. Body,&#8221; said Mack Allen, 36, an alumnus from Memphis, who wore a T-shirt to a recent football game that read, &#8220;Colonel Reb  &mdash;  Loved by Many, Hated by Few.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really give a damn what the naysayers, Blacks, the PC crowd, and the ultra-liberal commie pinkos say, keep Colonel Reb no matter what it takes.  I hope all the Ole Miss alumni feel the same way as Mr. Allen.  Let their checkbooks do the talking, and fight like hell.</p>

		<p>Watching the Ole Miss game saturday I noticed the hip hop music being played and not one note of Dixie. I also noticed the stands were not full and not one Rebel flag in sight. Ole Reb was again missing from the sidelines.All of this because the school adm. didnt want to offend anyone. The Rebel name was to honor the young soldiers who formed a company in the war between the states and all were killed in battle. Is this the way we are going to honor these brave student soldiers from now on,doing away with the mascot,not playing Dixie not flying the Rebel banner? The citizens of Mississippi that used to fill the stadium think not.</p>

<p>Activism is what&rsquo;s needed.  There is no way they can stop private individuals from manufacturing and distributing patriotic Colonel Reb images.</p>

		<p>When the Ole Miss marching band is on the field, they are in the habit of playing &#8220;Dixie&#8221;, but very slowly. And usually, the cameras focus on the black band member. The media is fond of doing that. There is supposed to be a contradiction here? But there is not. ONLY perceived in the minds of those in the control room?</p>

I see a locative trade in black market Colonel Reb tees and accessories.</p>
<p>At each game, I&rsquo;d like to see people come in with Colonel Reb gear under their coats and such. As soon as the game starts, everyone takes off their coats to reveal a sea of Colonel Rebs.</p>

		<p>The Ole Miss football team has exactly three white starters and 19 black starters. Most top teams in college football are at least half white (Ohio State, Michigan State) or more than half white (Boise State, Wisconsin, Stanford).</p>
<p>Why would any white person cheer for such a team or even care who the mascot of this team is? It is a black team run by people who essentially practice black supremacy when it comes to fielding a team.</p>
<p>Why disgrace the legacy of Colonel Reb by associating with New Miss?</p>

		<p>Obviously Ole Miss ain&rsquo;t what she used to be, perhaps if current students started boycotting sports events and Alumni tightened the purse strings the current libtards in charge at Ole Miss will get the message.</p>

		<p>I have already been through this process&hellip;..de-Confederate.</p>
<p>All of my earned degrees are from Middle Tennessee State University, which used to have General Nathan Bedford Forrest as our school mascot. The sports teams are still called &#8220;Blue Raider&#8221; but the new mascot is a damn flying horse&hellip;..for some reason. </p>
<p>We had the bitter debate every year on campus. (I was there from 1973-1983.) The Confederate battle flag had already been banned, as was the case at Old Miss. But the anti-confederates were not satisfied until every mention or vestige of our Confederate heritage was completely banned from campus.</p>
<p>Without thinking, they are establishing a precedent for the same purge taking place in the future&hellip;..which could restore our Confederate heritage and ban those who oppose it. Yes, it can happen.</p>

		<p>The best course of action is for all Whites to completely abandon Ole Miss, physically, emotionally, and financially. <i>White Flight</i> should commence immediately. The flow of White money to the university should completely stop. White students should enroll elsewhere. White alumni should permanently close their wallets.</p>
<p>Do not make idle threats to do so. Do not attempt to negotiate and find &#8220;common ground&#8221;. Simply pull out and withdraw, en mass!</p>
<p>Show them once and for all that the knife of diversity cuts both ways and is decidedly sharper on one side!!! Apply this principle to all walks of life!</p>
<p>The freedom to segregate and the freedom to terminate the flow of money are a couple of the few remaining freedoms that Whites still enjoy. I encourage everyone to exercise both to their fullest extent! There is <b>nothing</b> the egalitarians can do to stop you, and they will damned well feel the affects of the White gravy train stopping!</p>
<p>Once the Whites are gone, the undesirables will be completely free to change the school&rsquo;s nickname to the Ole Miss Kings. The new mascot will be the graven image of Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>
<p>Good riddance, Ole Miss!</p>
<p>By the way, in the aftermath of White Flight, when the customary surveys come pouring out in an effort to determine why Whites not longer support Ole Miss or attend college there, make sure you let them know why   &mdash;   in vivid detail!<br>

		<p>Ol Miss may have really screwed themselves. If they refuse to make any products with the rebel mascot then it can no longer be protected as a trademark. No trade? No mark! They may have the rebel protected with a copyright, but given the genericness of the longhaired, white haired, white suited Southern gentleman it is doubtful they would prevail.</p>
<p>What this means is they no longer control the Colonel and cannot stop anyone else from making and selling it. The only thing they could do is prevent students or others from entering the stadium if they were wearing Rebel gear, but if they did that they would be committing political and cultural suicide.</p>
<p>So start cranking out Rebel gear, you tee-shirt makers, hat makers, and sweatshirt makers! Keep the Colonel alive and make all the money that Ol Miss has scored to throw away!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been familiar with the long-standing &#8220;controversy&#8221; over Colonel Reb, as it has been a big issue for the CofCC in Mississippi for a long time.  This is why I &#8220;lovingly&#8221; called the Ole Miss Chancellor who first wanted Col. Reb gone Osama bin Khayat.  Also, it seems to me that Ole Miss&rsquo;s strategy is to wear down the opposition to the point that they give up.  Poster 3 Kogle indicates to me that the strategy seems to be working, for their side.  </p>
<p>Back in the days when Ole Miss fans were actually &#8220;rebelling,&#8221; the stadium security guards would prohibit the flags using such excuses like &#8220;the flag pole is a dangerous weapon.&#8221;  So when fans bought flags attached to cardboard poles, they were daring security to prohibit them, in order to force it into court as a First Amendment issue.  But this was about 15 years ago.</p>

		<p>The same bunco artists pulled the same &#8220;holier than thou&#8221; phony, politically correct controversy stuff at the University of Illinois. The Indian mascot of the Fighting Illini was racist according to these folks. It did not bother them a whit that the university and the state derived their name from the same Indian tribe, it was the depiction of an Indian chief that had to go.</p>
<p>A few miles further up the road, the minor league Peoria Chiefs dropped their team logo of an Indian chief and returned with a cartoon dog wearing a fire department chief&rsquo;s helmet. </p>
<p>Stupidity is the stock in trade of the liberals.  </p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;ve got James Meredith on tape, stating ; &#8221; It was never about education, it was about bringing down the status quo .&#8221; Why sould we be surprised or dismayed at what is going on at Ole Miss or across the country . It could&rsquo;ve been predicted over forty years ago . Those who did not establish the nation, whom we consider to be &#8220;less&#8221; than ourselves, are going to school and getting their law degrees and kicking our little red wagons till they&rsquo;re blue . And we are perplexed by it all ? For those too young to remember, real conservatives (and we had them back then) in the sixties told us this is what would happen if the civil rights bill of 1964 ? And the Immigration Bill of 1965 passed . You think it is bad now, wait until we are the minority . And it will not be a long wait either .</p>
