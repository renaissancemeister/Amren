			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nikole Hannah-Jones, The Root, September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>No one knows why Bethany Storro decided to mutilate her own face with acid late last month. Obviously deeply troubled, she was sane enough to make a calculated decision to maximize sympathy and deflect suspicion. She blamed it on a black person.</p>
<p>And the fake acid attack became the latest twist on a tactic as old as America itself, one that plays into every long-held stereotype of black folks as criminal and violent: the racial hoax. The racial hoax &#8220;plays into long-standing fear and part of American folklore, that the main victims of blacks are white women,&#8221; says Adrian Pantoja, a political scientist at Pitzer College in California who specializes in American racial attitudes. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very strategic because they know they will get the most attention if they claim the perpetrator is black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police, as in many of these cases, were skeptical from the start. {snip}</p>
<p>The Columbian, the daily newspaper that broke the story, turned off comments to its site as they became openly racist, and white supremacists staked out the page. Commenters called the alleged attacker a savage beast who deserved the death penalty. Someone said the black woman attacked Storro because of a &#8220;lifetime of hostility and resentment&#8221; toward a woman who is &#8220;white and pretty.&#8221; Another person suggested the attacker should &#8220;fear for her life.&#8221; These were some of the gentler comments.</p>
<p>Random black women who met the very vague description were stopped and questioned. Money for the victim poured in, and fundraising fliers posted around the 83 percent-white Vancouver called on the community to &#8220;help one of our own.&#8221; When a few bloggers and online commenters and, later, some mainstream media questioned the credibility of Storro&rsquo;s story, they were attacked for even raising a doubt.</p>
<p>Katheryn Russell-Brown is director of the Center for the Study of Race and Race Relations at the University of Florida and author of the book The Color of Crime: Racial Hoaxes, White Fear, Black Protectionism, Police Harassment, and Other Macroaggressions. She has tracked more than 100 racial hoaxes. White people  &mdash;  usually white women  &mdash;  perpetrate the vast majority of them. Black men are almost always the targets. &#8220;The image of criminality and race, and African Americans and crime, are very linked in the public mind,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You get additional sympathy for these attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tactic used by white women that once had black men swinging from trees and led to the writing of the renowned book To Kill a Mockingbird. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The connection in many Americans&rsquo; minds between black people and criminality is so strong, Russell-Brown says, that white perpetrators lean on the stereotype even when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Storro case is unusual in that the blame was placed on a black woman instead of a man. Russell-Brown did not find a single other instance of this in her files. But Lori Brown, a sociologist at Meredith College, the largest women&rsquo;s college in the Southeast, says Storro still had the savvy to lean on stereotypes when creating the phantom black woman. &#8220;That plays on the whole idea that black women are jealous of white women,&#8221; Brown says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s so offensive in this case because there are so many media stereotypes of black women being mean and tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already, Storro is being painted as the victim, and the harm done to the black community is being pushed aside, says Russell-Brown. {snip}</p>
<p>But that sympathy seemed to have been waning Monday as Clark County Deputy Prosecutor Tony Golik filed three counts of second-degree theft by deception against Storro for the thousands of dollars in donations she received after the incident. That puts the Storro case in the minority of racial hoaxes. {snip}</p>

		<p>She blamed it on a black person, yes.  And you, Nikole with a &#8220;k&#8221;, were undoubtedly among those who refused to mention race when the original story broke, but who are over-eager to do so now.</p>
<p><br>
Nikole is mentally ill.  You&rsquo;d have to be, to write about the &#8220;long-held stereotype of black folks as criminal and violent: the racial hoax.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
If it&rsquo;s a hoax, then I dare her to go around alone at night in a black urban area.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a hoax, then I suppose there are no violent black gangs, no reason for the prisons being filled, except for &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>You, Nikole, make me sick.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strategic because they know they will get the most attention if they claim the perpetrator is black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.  Witness the original failure to focus on race, precisely because the supposed attacker was black.  The attention-getters are blacks who blame whites.</p>

		<p>Amazing how everything in this article is exactly the opposite of reality.</p>
<p>Blacks commit almost all the racial hoaxes in the U.S. - almost always against whites.</p>
<p>I know of 4 cases in the last 25 years where whites have blamed blacks for a crime. But in not one of these cases did the white say he was attacked because of his race.</p>
<p>Unlike Miss Storro, the blacks in these hoax cases almost never are charged with a crime. Some - like Tawanna Brawley and the Duke lacrosse hoaxer - are treated as heroes by blacks.</p>
<p>But the sad fact is, people such as Nikole-Hanna Jones and Katheryn Russell Jones get to set the racial agenda in the U.S. They get to write for Microsoft funded publications and run university centers on race.</p>

		<p>Wow! No one ever heard of Tawanna Brawley or the Duke rape hoax or OJ Simpson or, or, or?? The Zebra killer was never caught. FBI statistics show that blacks commit 90 percent of all interracial crime. Is this a hoax too?</p>

		<p>There is a huge difference between someone making up lies and someone throwing acid in their own face.</p>
<p>Unless this woman has a serious psychotic type mental illness, there is simply no way, NO WAY AT ALL, that she did this.  Being garden variety nuts doesn&rsquo;t cut it with self mutilation, setting yourself on fire, splashing acid in your face etc.  Only an actual psychotic break would explain this type of behavior.  And that doesn&rsquo;t just happen, one day.  Someone like this would absolutely be under the care of professionals, unless they occupied the absolute bottom of society (ie a crackhead, living on the streets).</p>
<p>Once you admit this.  You can understand the seriousness of this incident.  There is just no way this story is true.  She recanted her testimony against the criminal who did this to her.  Only one reason a person does that&hellip;.death threats.</p>
<p>Who made the death threats?  Friends of the woman who was caught based on this victims description?  Possible.  But based on how this story is being used&hellip;..as a way to set the stage to deny the incredible scope and breadth of racist &#8220;crime&#8221; against whites, it&rsquo;s almost certainly likely she received death threats from the communist left, probably infiltrators into the local government, courts and/or law enforcement.</p>
<p>What disturbs me is roughly half the people who read this story (among white nationalists), actually believe it.  Shame on you.  You people, more than anyone else, know just how deeply the media is controlled and how flagrant and institutionalized anti-white racism has become.  Your immediate, kneejerk reaction to this should be, it&rsquo;s an obvious lie.  She was obviously victimized&hellip;..and forced to recant.</p>
<p>You should be looking for evidence of who forced her to recant&hellip;.and marking who they are.  That information may become very important in the near future&hellip;&hellip;because race war has graduated from rape, robberies, muggings to throwing acid in our women&rsquo;s faces.  We are very close now to OVERT race war&hellip;..not the &#8220;dirty war&#8221; that has been waged against us for decades now.  That&rsquo;s what incidents like this mean.</p>

		<p>Well, of course, this article was edited with the intent to psychologically disarm potential victims of &#8220;Black&#8221; crime. I doubt this tactic will work any longer. Too many people have been victimized by &#8220;Black&#8221; crime and &#8220;Black&#8221; criminals to believe their own eyes are lying to them.</p>

<p>Oddly both Comrades Pantoja and Hannah-Jones, fail to make any mention of the Duke &ldquo;rape&rdquo; Hoax, Tawana Brawley, or any of the other 100s of hate hoaxes committed by blacks and blamed on whites. That is to say nothing of the millions of real and disproportionate numbers of actual hate crimes perpetrated by blacks against whites, such as the Knoxville Horror, that happen on a near daily basis in the USA. Somehow I am not surprised at all!</p>
<p>For far too long, blacks have been given a pass in this country for both their hoaxed and genuine hate crimes that they commit against whites. Personally, I think that capital punishment should be visited upon them whenever they engage in either form of these crimes against our race. Of course, that is only my opinion and what do I know from this or that?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>First, look at the source of this piece. &#8220;The Root&#8221; - a one-sided, race-baiting, dumbed-down web site (owned, apparently, by The Washington Post Co.) ostensibly for blacks. </p>
<p>It views all life through the prism of the oppressed African American and sanitizes selected news. It&rsquo;s basically just lowbrow nonsense one step removed from the Al Sharpton School of Journalism. The writers (I wonder how many are white) apparently have a free hand to make up whatever they want since no one bothers to criticize it - probably because no one reads it. It presents the tired, warped viewpoint that is not taken seriously and I suspect it&rsquo;s existence is due, in large part, to &#8220;diversity money&#8221; from corporations hoping to polish their image (and fend off lawsuits).</p>
<p>As for the article, all you can say is that with the staggering amount of black crime of course everyone would believe a story with a black criminal, even liberals. Yes, there are a few hoax incidents (gee, more perpetrated by blacks but we&rsquo;ll let that go for now) however that doesn&rsquo;t change the outrageous criminal behavior of blacks - which should be the real focus of the article.<br>
 <br>
Lastly, here&rsquo;s the blurb from another story appearing on &#8220;The Root.&#8221; I rest my case.</p>
<p>The Root<br>
Rosa Parks&rsquo; Other (Radical) Side<br>
The flesh-and-blood Rosa Parks was a lot more interesting than the one we read about in history books. A new book details how she was a warrior for justice for black women who were brutally raped by white men in the segregated South.</p>

		<p>The reason, &#8220;The connection in many Americans&rsquo; minds between black people and criminality is so strong,&#8221; is because blacks have a rate of violent crime that is seven times the white rate.<br>

		<p>Right, the FBI stats that point out black commit most of the violent crimes (and especially against whites) are all just lies and hoaxes.  Because we all know that blacks NEVER make up lies about white racism, do they?</p>
