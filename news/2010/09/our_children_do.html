			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Slack, Daily Mail (London), September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black children fail at school because they do not concentrate, not because they are the victims of &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;, a leading black academic claims today.</p>
<p>Tony Sewell, the son of Caribbean migrants, attacks the view that black pupils are held back by teachers who see them as &#8216;miniature gangster rappers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The former teacher, who runs an educational charity for black children, instead blames poor parenting and the youngsters&rsquo; own lax attitude.</p>
<p>In a blistering article for the Left-of-centre magazine Prospect, Dr Sewell says that while it was once true that black pupils were held back by racism, &#8216;times have changed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He writes: &#8216;What we now see in schools is children undermined by poor parenting, peer-group pressure and an inability to be responsible for their own behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are not subjects of institutional racism.</p>
<p>&#8216;They have failed their GCSEs because they did not do the home-work, did not pay attention and were disrespectful to their teachers.</p>
<p>&#8216;Instead of challenging our children, we have given them the discourse of the victim  &mdash;  a sense that the world is against them and they cannot succeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The view that black children are being held back by racism was reinforced by the last Labour government.</p>
<p>Labour leadership hopeful Diane Abbott has said that &#8216;black boys do not have to be too long out of disposable nappies for some teachers to see them as a miniature gangster rappers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Sewell  &mdash;  director of the Generating Genius charity and a consultant at Reading University  &mdash;  says that Miss Abbott and researchers imply that white teachers have low expectations of black boys and this is partly why they underachieve.</p>
<p>He admits evidence proves that &#8216;African-Caribbean boys are still at the bottom of the league table for GCSEs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They start school at roughly same level as other pupils, but then fall further and further behind their peers.</p>
<p>However, he also writes: &#8216;I believe black underachievement is due to the low expectations of school leaders, who do not want to be seen as racist and who position black boys as victims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2008, the Department for Education reported that only 27 per cent of black boys achieve five or more A*-C GCSE grades.</p>
<p>African-Caribbean boys are also the group most likely to be excluded from school<br>

		<p>At a time when the quality of the average working class white male in England is at an all time low, why do they need to flood the country with low class males of other races and cultures?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how they say in America here when the soaring poverty is mentioned - well, stop importing more poor people and the level will go down!</p>

<p>Willie Giest and Jon Meacham were on MSNBC this morning gloating about the Whites, especially Meacham&rsquo;s wife Ms. Keith Meacham, who are working so hard to show that blacks in New York can demonstrate greater academic achievement than White students. Then Meacham said the typical &#8220;It&rsquo;s a civil rights issue, and we must put it in moral terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>White Humanity must sacrifice itself for the uplift of blacks, as usual, because &#8220;it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nietzsche would be sickened by this nonsense.  We should only invest ourselves in those who have potential to be great, not the &#8220;least of these.&#8221;   We don&rsquo;t do the right thing, and we are suffering the degeneration of White America as a result.  All our great White thinkers warned us what would happen, and now it has.</p>
<p>Anytime you encounter an articulate, educated, well-dressed, white-acting black, look behind him for a train of dispossessed Whites who were forced into misery for his sake.</p>
<p>To elevate one black, you must submerge ten Whites.  The advancement of ten Whites comes at same expense as advancing one black.  We waste our best to help their worst.  We are near the end of the hoax, and the collapse will be very ugly and bitter, but refreshing and regeneration.    I wish William Gayley Simpson and Savitri Devi were here to guide us through it and onto the glittering shores ahead.<br>

<p>This is the sort of nonsense that gets publicly trotted out now and then to give the governmedia an air of &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;balance&#8221; by presenting &#8220;alternative viewpoints.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, but it&rsquo;s not working.  Black children fail at school because they are genetically incapable of reaching the same level as White and Oriental children.</p>
<p>When the fawning marxist governmedia start printing <i>that</i>, I&rsquo;ll start believing in &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;balance.&#8221;  Until then, it&rsquo;s just more smoke and mirrors to distract the lemmings from the obvious.<br>

		<p>Usually, a half truth is more truthful than a lie.  But in this case, a half truth is just as big of a lie as an actual lie.  While Sewell is right that &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; (no such thing) isn&rsquo;t to blame (because it doesn&rsquo;t exist, duh), he then turns around and blames a bunch of externalities (bad parenting), which also exist among whites, but for some reason, have not meant that white students don&rsquo;t do well in school.  </p>
<p>He also adopts the George W. Bush bromide, that black boys don&rsquo;t do well because we don&rsquo;t expect them to do well.  I&rsquo;m not a neurosurgeon   &mdash;   Am I not a neurosurgeon because all my teachers and my parents were derelict in their duty to expect me to be a neurosurgeon, or could be be a much simpler answer, that I didn&rsquo;t have the intelligence to handle the pre-med and medical school education to become one, nor did I have the strong stomach to deal with the sight of human innards, nor do I have a stable enough hand to deal with delicate tools around a delicate organ?</p>
<p>Here, we have nuggets of truth interspersed with lame excuses borne of the same egalitarian nonsense which spawns other excuses that Sewell rebukes.  In other words, an Overton Window style of &#8220;permissible opposition&#8221; to liberal race orthodoxy that isn&rsquo;t really an opposition.  So, FAIL.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p><i>They start school at roughly same level as other pupils, but then fall further and further behind their peers.</i></p>
<p>That one is obvious   &mdash;   I know I&rsquo;ll get some opposition here, but the best explanation is the one that Rushton provided, the one I&rsquo;ve brought up here to explain why Head Start succeeds/fails   &mdash;   blacks mature more rapidly than whites as infants and toddlers and in early childhood, including brain development.  But they level off around age 10, give or take, while white brains keep on maturing for a number of years more.  So if you are a preschool teacher, blacks seem smart.  If you teach first grade, then blacks and whites are about equal.  But if you teach 7th grade, then it&rsquo;s going to be obvious that whites are smarter.  If you teach upper level high school courses (&#8220;sixth form,&#8221; in the Brit parlance), you&rsquo;d be lucky to see any blacks in your class room.</p>

<p>The above statement is at the heart of Black under achievement. It isn&rsquo;t lack of ability for most. It isn&rsquo;t racism. It is the mindset of being the victim in a racist and hostile world. There would be far more academic success if the Black community would move past this self destructive mindset.</p>

		<p>Despite the overwhelming testimony of teachers, black and white, in the US and in Britain, that blacks in middle school and above are lazy and disruptive, Obama and the bureaucrats pump billions into black and &#8216;minority&rsquo; so called schools. And Buffet and Gates, now joined by Mr Facebook Swindler Zuckerberg, pump billions into nonprofit education research centers which consult to troubled school systems. </p>
<p>With practically no real result except for a few points increases in worthless standardized tests that do not provide lasting knowledge, do not prepare anyone for college or a practical career. The teacher unions are the new scapegoats, the new Jews if you will, for the failings of African American and immigrant Third World kids. </p>
<p>The Asians, some of them, may be the exception to the rule. Culture and race predict education success, not mindless spending of borrowed and billionaire dollars into ridiculous schools that preach that &#8220;anyone&#8221; can learn what anyone else can learn. </p>

<p>I have a little bit of good news for you.  Zuckerberg really didn&rsquo;t give anything to the Newark schools.  Yeah, Facebook&rsquo;s press releases say that he donated &#8220;$100 million worth of FB shares,&#8221; but the dirty little secret is that Facebook is a private company   &mdash;   Its shares aren&rsquo;t traded on the open market, so there&rsquo;s no way to tell how much &#8220;private&#8221; shares are worth.  Even if FB goes public, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that these &#8220;private&#8221; shares automatically translate into owning real shares.</p>
<p>A writer for Forbes mag thinks this is all a PR stunt because Facebook is developing a Facebook-themed smartphone.  In other words, pretend to donate money to schools so all those parents will have no problem buying their teenagers a FB phone.  Of course, the internet is a fickle mistress, and what&rsquo;s here today is literally gone tomorrow.  Except www.amren.com, which has been the web&rsquo;s rock of stability all along, and will continue to be for a very long time.  (Pardon me while I go clean the brown off my nose.)  Even in the Web 2.0/ning world, MySpace was as big 5-7 yrs ago as FB is now.  AOL was once so &#8220;big&#8221; that it had the market capitalization to be able to buy an old line giant media company (Time-Warner).  Buy a FB phone now, and you&rsquo;ll look as foolish in 5 years as someone with an AOL-themed laptop looks today, except that the FB phone will probably be made in some no-name slaveshop in China, so it&rsquo;ll fall apart in 2 years.  </p>

		<p>The problem is no the equal and opposite of the one fifty years ago. When legal discrimination existed against blacks, it was hard to determine this community&rsquo;s actual capabilities. Now the same community labors under a different burden - the decadent culture of the racial spoils system. The current subsidy of poverty and bad behavior offered by schools, government, and mass media, creates a perverse incentive, and and incentive towards perversion.  As with the use of recreational drugs, bad behavior in one community does move over into those adjacent to it.</p>
<p>We can remove the disabling conditions by abolishing the poverty industry, re-legalizing self medication, and deleting affirmative action programs. The Aframerican community must get back to the sold values it still had half a century ago. Only then can we run the experiment to what is the content of its character.</p>

		<p>Yes, they never mention IQ and genetics, but is that even possible? Readers of amren often get agitated that so many &#8220;academics&#8221; omit a fact, that to us, should seem obvious, but think deeply about what that would mean. Imagine if the elite of the world finally admitted the truth, despite the expected outcries, what would happen? Riots maybe? Societal breakdown? Is there anyway possible we could go on continuing on this path that we are on now? Of course not. I&rsquo;m sure many in charge have thought about this, but they are paralyzed to do anything about it knowing the tremendous consequences that would be sure to come. </p>
<p>It sometimes seems like we&rsquo;re slowly walking into the lions den and we&rsquo;re afraid to turn around and run, because we know that they&rsquo;ll take chase and kill us. What we need to do is back away bit by bit. If we can first get leftists to admit that Black dysfunction isn&rsquo;t the fault of White people, then that&rsquo;s one step. Let&rsquo;s focus on that foot and make sure it stays planted long enough that the other foot has a chance to take a step back as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They fail because of &ldquo;poor parenting, peer pressure and an inability to be responsible for their own behavior.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Since their obvious low average I.Q. would still hold them back if they were in perfect homes, I&rsquo;m wondering why this is never mentioned.</p>

		<p>Sewell sounds much like our own Dr. Sowell.  And he&rsquo;s right.  While I decline to acknowledge that all races are intellectually equal, all races can contribute to human progress on some worthwhile level if all are held to the same standards of behavior and intellectual effort.</p>
<p>Tragically, blacks are not, and in fact holding them to those standards is all but illegal in our mad world.  In failing to do so western societies have doomed them to permanent members of an unproductive and largely criminal class.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tony Sewell, the son of Caribbean migrants, attacks the view that black pupils are held back by teachers who see them as &lsquo;miniature gangster rappers&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>This statement is absurd. Not because teachers &#8216;see every non-white as a miniature gangster rapper&rsquo;, but because every teacher in the system would see a real or potential gangster-rapper as someone more vital, more in tune, and more deserving of his tutelage than any vanilla white student. </p>
<p>I disagree with the poster who says that racism is not mandated at our schools &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s real. Favoring certain races seems to be job one for our media and government. The left seem gravely confused, however, as to which races are being favored and which are being discriminated against. And in confusion, the choice seems to be to redouble the effort. </p>

<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;They start school at roughly same level as other pupils, but then fall further and further behind their peers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>Blacks do not start school at the same level as White pupils.</p>
<p>Jensen writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Black-White IQ difference shows up before 3 years of age on most standardized test batteries, even after matching on maternal education and other variables&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/hsuuw</p>
<p>One of many reasons Head Start is an utter failure AND a tremendous waste of taxpayer money.  But be careful voicing this, you will be called a racist and hater.</p>
<p>And Murray:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;All the data about the trajectory of IQ scores over the life span indicate that they stabilize around ages six to ten and typically remain unchanged until old age&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2g7tqa7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2g7tqa7</a></p>
<p>Of course PC-wisdom blames any IQ  gap on culture, not on inherent intelligence or lack thereof.  The educational establishment, as always, will turn a blind eye and blame (pick one, several or all) White teachers, White oppression, institutional racism, ad nauseam and demand more money to remedy the situation.  And so it goes.</p>
<p>And, do not leave out inherent black vs. White behavioral issues.</p>
<p>From Ian Jobling:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The racial gap starts even before students get to school&hellip; Black preschoolers score considerably lower on ability tests than white preschoolers.</p>
<p>Behavior differences make it hard for blacks to learn. Black kindergartners are less persistent, less eager to learn, and less able to pay attention than white kindergartners, and these differences continue through high school&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/25vf3pg" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/25vf3pg</a></p>
<p>Poor black children have half the vocabularies as White children when they enter school.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby and Alan Poussaint write:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Teachers report that in poor neighborhoods children often begin school not knowing their colors or the letters of the alphabet&hellip;.Some have limited vocabularies and little knowledge of numbers. These deficits are hard to correct later on. Sharp-eyed teachers can identify the children who will become high school dropouts the day they walk in the kindergarten door. The damage is already done&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3mtm32" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3mtm32</a></p>
<p>No, black children do not fail because of White Racism or White Oppression.  They fail because they are not cognitively or behaviorally suitable or able to function in a society built by and appropriate for those at least one standard deviation above them in intelligence. </p>

		<p>WHAT IF&hellip;the article said this:</p>
<p>It was never true that black pupils were held back by racism because intelligence is innate. Perhaps at one time black opportunity was held back but not the ability to learn.</p>
<p>He writes: &lsquo;What we now have to admit is that in schools black children are undermined, if you will, by low IQs and intellectual incapacity. Perhaps 1 in 10 can compete with white students. Obviously, low IQ black parents can do little, if anything, to help their children in academics.&#8221;</p>

<p>This explanation is not being discussed, in part, because it requires a complete change in thinking and the admission by liberals of an error that cost America 50 years and billions of dollars. It also forces the writer of the above article to tacitly admit that the odds are that he isn&rsquo;t all that bright.</p>
<p>Lastly, it would stop everyone in their tracks because the new question would be: Now what do we do?<br>

		<p>In Britain black Africans are doing better than black Caribbeans and are almost at par with white Britons - but all these three groups are far behind Chinese and Indian pupils:</p>
<p>In maths:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-five per cent of Chinese pupils and 31 per cent of Indian pupils who took GCSE maths last year achieved an A, according to figures from the Department for Children, Schools and Families. <br>
Among white British pupils, the figure was 16 per cent. For black African pupils it was 14 per cent, for Pakistani 13 per cent and black Caribbean 8 per cent.&#8221; </p>
<p>In English:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese pupils were most likely to get As, with 29 per cent getting the top mark, compared with 21 per cent of Indian, 15 per cent of white British, 11 per cent of black African, 9 per cent of Pakistani and 8 per cent of black Caribbean.&#8221; </p>

		<p>@4 Question Diversity,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&hellip;blacks mature more rapidly than whites as infants and toddlers and in early childhood, including brain development.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I think it is more than this.  I think there are major differences in prefrontal cortex, myelin coating thickness, Corpus Collosum axonial pathways, total brain volume and convolute densities.  And a host of other issues, all of which are buried in long sequence DNA with potentially millions of grouping and folding variables.</p>
<p>That said, I think if you could sit down an _honest_ first year &#8216;brain surgeon&rsquo; (neuro chemistry studies) medical student, he could point out these racial anatomical differences from dissection studies and microscope tissue slides as VISIBLE differences.</p>
<p>That said, if you are right and blacks simply outgrow learning in an evolutionary adaptation to a hostile environment that requires rapid reproductive largesse, the first thing to do is to keep them kids longer, letting their brains soak in knowledge instead of early-onset testosterone as the approach of puberty.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s morphological and multi-gene sequence driven, the truth will prove itself.  If it can be simply medicated, with marked SES improvements, that too is worth it, if only in terms of prison costs.</p>
<p>I also think that the neuro surgeon ideal is dishonest because the elites are clearly shaping society to breed the best from the best and create an independent upper class for whom &#8216;color is not an issue&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, blacks start at such an enormous deficit and there is such a poor (public) understanding of the racial genetics behind _recession to the mean_ statistics, even in brilliant people&rsquo;s children, that we risk a lot, even by cherry picking brilliance, for miscegenative purposes.</p>
<p>@9 Anon,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The problem is now the equal and opposite of the one fifty years ago.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  The problem is -buried- now when it was -obvious- fifty years ago.  In 1957-64 segregation allowed schools to be judged meritocratically, on the basis of their funding and teacher qualifications, independent of color.  The Coleman report, which led to bussing and all the other things, in fact stated that black Southern Schools were -better- funded than white ones as the Jim Crow states rushed to make segregation as palatable as possible.</p>
<p>Now you could argue that this was a symptom of racism and that as soon as they got what they wanted, it would all have been undone, back then.  But not today.  Where it would be simple to legislate equal dollars for equal matching federal funds or whatever.  As truly &#8216;affirmative but separate&rsquo; equal opportunity.</p>
<p>Instead, knowing the truth must be suppressed to meet their own warped agendas, the Elites force the races to work together and in the process &#8216;adjust scores&rsquo; to make sure that whites are dumbed down by lower achievement standards and blacks look good because they are part of white scoring schools.  This MUST stop.  Because standards everywhere else around the world are not being graded on a curve.  That&rsquo;s why they are called standards.</p>
<p>@16 Middle American</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Lastly, it would stop everyone in their tracks because the new question would be: Now what do we do?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Are you at all cynical?</p>
<p>If you victimize a man, you do more to keep him in a labeled class group than if you force him to fight his way through the system.  An excuse to be nothing means that the successful support his/her failure as the cost of keeping him/her out of Elite lives which -endorses- the sense of competing only amongst themselves.  Paying for their own sense of superiority with your tax dollars is not such a bitter pill for them.</p>
<p>If you are however in the mood for true charity, we have the technology, within 10 years, to make exogenics a viable means to apply genomic therapies, in the womb (it&rsquo;s not just the genes but when they express that matters).  If you splice or virally insert genes from X race into Y race&rsquo;s genome, theoretically, their high degree of sub-species commonality will allow rapid biochemical and morphologic &#8216;improvements&rsquo;, with minimum thalidomide disastrous consequences.  Bigger skull volumes, thicker myelin coatings, changes to prefrontal inhibitory and inter-hemisphere communicative capacities.  Not all of them, by any means, &#8216;white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, again, if you want leverage SES for whites/asians/jews/parsi (as elites defending their restricted access to wealth) as a _non competed_ ethnic advantage, you do this for everyone.  If nothing else, it would mean the end of class ranked capitalism as we know it because egalitarianism has to apply to everyone and there aren&rsquo;t many 120IQ ditch diggers.</p>
<p>@17 Linnea,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;The Chinese pupils were most likely to get As, with 29 per cent getting the top mark, compared with 21 per cent of Indian, 15 per cent of white British, 11 per cent of black African, 9 per cent of Pakistani and 8 per cent of black Caribbean.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And there is the proof.  Statistically, we are being divided up into cross-racial cladograms precursors to the &#8216;next step&rsquo; sociologically if not genetically.</p>
<p>Even the Elites may not fully know this but by selectively entitling those of high IQ to class privilege through a common educational system standard of grading, the Elites are creating the precursors for &#8216;Humanity Superiensis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is ironic that this very system of submergence of Nazi ideology across all economic/racial/cultural boundaries was discussed by no less than Martin Bormann in his 1943 meeting with German industry to set up a Capital Flight Program.  To own the world before flooding it with internal cultural change.</p>
<p>Do not doubt that once they have achieved a certain political critical mass through &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; which cannot be defeated because it is a universal grouping ideal with appeal to every underclass, that &#8216;suddenly&rsquo; it will become okay to talk about pan-racial genetics as a means to improving all colors.  But only via certain classes.  Once the new Elite have been chosen.  Once the cybernetics of transhumanism meet up with the genetic factors from the previous leading races which have been selectively defined for cross pollination into other groups.  Once there is no stopping the madness based on a group affinity preference for advantage and inheritance.  Once all the rest of us are properly positioned and groomed to be slaves.</p>

Blacks have never concerned themselves with the truth. What matters is what they believe. What they believe is what feeds their paranoia that they&rsquo;re eternal victims of the white mans racism.</p>

		<p>A book I am reading now is called &#8220;Bad Students Not Bad Schools&#8221; by Robert Weissberg. It argues that intelligence and motivation are key to academic success, whereas pedagogy, resources, and instruction are less important. He argues that even if a child is weaker intellectually, he often can compensate with proper motivation. I do think motivation foes hand in hand with family support. This is the key weakness with our inner city schools IMO!</p>

<p>Yes, but it&rsquo;s easier when a child at home sees his parents are successful and working some kind professional job. Success builds on success. Those who save a lot of money often started out with a small amount saved somewhere. Successful bodybuilders are those who see results after one or two workouts. Even the intelligent youngsters in school often can&rsquo;t really see how their success at school will translate into something good in their later life. </p>

		<p>A cry in the wilderness, but it&rsquo;s too little, too late&hellip;Britain is on the verge of collapse because of their emberacing of diversity to the point of self-destruction. The men and women in uniform who sacrificed everything to save England from the Nazis must be turning over in their graves to see the country as it is today.</p>

		<p>As post #3 states: </p>
<p>&#8220;Black children fail at school because they are genetically incapable of reaching the same level as White and Oriental children.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the real truth at the core of the matter.  And I suspect that these people who are dancing around this reality know deep inside that this is the real reason why blacks fail.</p>
<p>A friend of a woman I knew taught a class one summer whose purpose was to show black children how to use a computer.  By the end of the course, she felt nothing but frustration.  She stated that despite the eagerness of most of the students to learn, they were simply incapable of doing so.  The ability just wasn&rsquo;t there, and no amount of instruction made any difference.</p>

<p>Richard Fuerle makes a similar argument in Erectus Walks Amongst Us, <a href="https://erectuswalksamongst.us/Chap11.html." rel="nofollow">https://erectuswalksamongst.us/Chap11.html.</a> Specifically, he claims that black infants develop certain abilities much faster than whites.</p>
<p>Even mainstream sources agree that black girls start menstruating earlier than white girls, which by definition means that they are maturing faster.</p>

		<p><i>Yes, they never mention IQ and genetics, but is that even possible? Readers of amren often get agitated that so many &ldquo;academics&rdquo; omit a fact, that to us, should seem obvious, but think deeply about what that would mean. Imagine if the elite of the world finally admitted the truth, despite the expected outcries, what would happen? Riots maybe? Societal breakdown? Is there anyway possible we could go on continuing on this path that we are on now? Of course not. I&rsquo;m sure many in charge have thought about this, but they are paralyzed to do anything about it knowing the tremendous consequences that would be sure to come. </i></p>
<p><br>
This is the essence of the dilemma. Can you imagine what would happen if a grade school principal or university dean stood up and said that there are genetic differences which cause disparities in learning outcomes? It simply would not be accepted and would, no doubt, lead to mass violence. Look at what happened to Stephanie Grace over at Harvard for simply mentioning this in an email. She was forced to apologize for stating an scientific truth.</p>
<p>It can be argued that since we live in a multiracial society, there must be some public common ideology to keep everyone from killing each other, and liberal PC is it. But it means this society is living a lie. And a lie which is going to doom the West. If there is no difference in inherent intelligence, then there can be no reason to stop third world immigration, or mass reproduction of the low-IQ end of the populace. And if there are disparities in outcomes, then via ideology, it must be the fault of &#8220;racism&#8221; or some other such scapegoat. So the end result is going to be either more subjugation of White people, or civil violence.</p>
<p>Perhaps we have painted ourselves into a corner and the only way out is the collapse of current civilization?</p>
