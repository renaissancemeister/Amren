<h1>&#8216;Pre-Crime&rsquo; Comes to the HR Dept.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Elgan, datamation.com, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Santa Barbara, Calif., startup called Social Intelligence data-mines the social networks to help companies decide if they really want to hire you.</p>
<p>While background checks, which mainly look for a criminal record, and even credit checks have become more common, Social Intelligence is the first company that I&rsquo;m aware of that systematically trolls social networks for evidence of bad character.</p>
<p>Using automation software that slogs through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, LinkedIn, blogs, and &#8220;thousands of other sources,&#8221; the company develops a report on the &#8220;real you&#8221;  &mdash;  not the carefully crafted you in your resume. The service is called Social Intelligence Hiring. The company promises a 48-hour turn-around.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s illegal to consider race, religion, age, sexual orientation and other factors, the company doesn&rsquo;t include that information in its reports. Humans review the reports to eliminate false positives. And the company uses only publically shared data  &mdash;  it doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;friend&#8221; targets to get private posts, for example.</p>
<p>{snip} The company mines for rich nuggets of raw sewage in the form of racy photos, unguarded commentary about drugs and alcohol and much more.</p>
<p>The company also offers a separate Social Intelligence Monitoring service to watch the personal activity of existing employees on an ongoing basis. {snip}</p>
<p>The service provides real-time notification alerts, so presumably the moment your old college buddy tags an old photo of you naked, drunk and armed on Facebook, the boss gets a text message with a link.</p>
<p>Two aspects of this are worth noting. First, company spokespeople emphasize liability. {snip}</p>
<p>In other words, they make the case that now that people use social networks, companies will be expected (by shareholders, etc.) to monitor those services and protect the company from lawsuits, damage to reputation, and other harm. And they&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>Second, the company provides reporting that deemphasizes specific actions and emphasizes character. It&rsquo;s less about &#8220;what did the employee do&#8221; and more about &#8220;what kind of person is this employee?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because, again, the goal isn&rsquo;t punishment for past behavior but protection of the company from future behavior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Future of Predicting the Future</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Cambridge, Mass., company called Recorded Future, which is funded by both Google and the CIA, claims to use its &#8220;temporal analytics engine&#8221; to predict future events and activities by companies and individual people.</p>
<p>Like Social Intelligence, Recorded Future uses proprietary software to scan all kinds of public web sites, then use some kind of magic pixie dust to find both invisible logical linkages (as opposed to HTML hyperlinks) that lead to likely outcomes. Plug in your search criteria, and the results come in the form of surprisingly accurate future predictions.</p>
<p>Recorded Future is only one of many new approaches to predictive analytics expected to emerge over the next year or two. The ability to crunch data to predict future outcomes will be used increasingly to estimate traffic jams, public unrest, and stock performance. But it will also be used to predict the behavior of employees.</p>
<p>Google revealed last year, for example, that it is developing a search algorithm that can accurately predict which of its employees are most likely to quit. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All hiring and promotion, and some firing, are based on predictions about the future. They take available data (resumes, interviews, references, background checks, etc.) and advise hiring managers on what kind of asset a person will be in the future. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following the current trend lines, very soon social networking spiders and predictive analytics engines will be working night and day scanning the Internet and using that data to predict what every employee is likely to do in the future. This capability will simply be baked right in to HR software suites.</p>
<p>When the software decides that you&rsquo;re going to quit, steal company secrets, break the law, post something indecent on a social network or lie on your expense report, the supervising manager will be notified and action will be taken  &mdash;  before you make the predicted transgression.</p>
<p>If you think that&rsquo;s unlikely, consider the following two facts. First, think about how fast we got to where we are today. Three years ago you had never heard of Twitter and were not a member of Facebook. Today, you could be passed over for a job because of something you or even someone else posted on one of these services.</p>
<p>Second, contrast personnel actions with legal actions. When you stand before the law accused of wrongdoing, you get to face your accuser. You can&rsquo;t legally be thrown in jail for bad character, poor judgment, or expectations of what you might do in the future. You have to actually break the law, and they have to prove it.</p>
<p>Personnel actions aren&rsquo;t anything like this. You don&rsquo;t get to &#8220;face your accuser.&#8221; You can be passed over for hiring or promotion based on what kind of person you are or what they think you might do in the future. You don&rsquo;t have to actually violate company rules, and they don&rsquo;t have to prove it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;are they trying to latch on to any excuse not to hire a right-wing white person?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is my guess as to what it would be. Certain sites on the Internet designated by SPLC as &#8220;hate&#8221; sites [whatever hate is] and who visits them or makes posts, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t hire that person&#8221; would be the refrain!<br>

		<p>I guess everyone that post here is will now be profiled as right wing extremist along with those that log on to Foxnews, Glenn Beck,and Rush Limbaugh just to name a few. It sounds like most of white America will be disqualified from the workforce. </p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&rsquo;s illegal to consider race, religion, age, sexual orientation and other factors, the company doesn&rsquo;t include that information in its reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company doesn&rsquo;t have too. Just one look on Facebook will answer most of those questions. I guess one could change their surfing habits in order to create a profile for a particular company. As Southern Hoosier I can be a right wing Obama hating radical, supporter of the Tea Party and the Minutemen, but under my real name I can be mild mannered liberal supporter of Obama and everything else that is wrong with this country. </p>

		<p>@1: Probably it is neither. It is a technology, not an ideology, and it will be used, and misused, by various men, for various reasons. There is, in my opinion, some danger that corporate diversity types will use such technologies to identify men whose opinions are not like their own, or that they will come to be used for, e.g., jury selection, and with a similar purpose.<br>

		<p>Let me guess - this software will warn employers if your facebook page is &#8216;friended&rsquo; by felons, contains glorification of violence and drug use, along with sexual impropriety?  Sounds like that would snag a much higher percentage of blacks than whites, leading to &#8216;discrimination&rsquo;, lawsuits, etc.  </p>
<p>Since &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo; discrimination lawsuits are won by racial head counting, regardless of facts or actions, this software will ultimately be used ONLY against white heterosexual males.  Big surprise.  Whites should abandon social media to protect themselves.  </p>

<p><br>
Interesting that they chose this example.  Being naked in private circumstances isn&rsquo;t illegal, nor is being armed, and photographs don&rsquo;t display blood-alcohol contents.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this software is more about political correctness reinforcement than crime and liability.  </p>

		<p>I heard somewhere that it was always good to do a &#8220;google&#8221; search on yourself.   Most things will pop up, and then you can pretty much check to see how you &#8220;look to the world&#8221;..  I even found a review of a book I did on Amazon&hellip; So you need to watch comments there!!!  The book was the &#8220;Wilding of America&#8221; by Charles Derber.. It was a book that was suggested reading in Sociology class.  And&hellip; anyone can visit your wish list there too, all the need is your email address, so don&rsquo;t put nasty things in your wish list.  Ha!</p>

I don&rsquo;t believe this is about race. It&rsquo;s merely the logical next step in the use of data mining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stayed away from all &#8216;social networking&rsquo; sites but even so, every time you connect to anything, your IP address is attached.</p>
<p>Just connect to this webpage to see how easy it is for you service provider to track you.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.find-ip-address.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.find-ip-address.org/</a></p>
<p>Internet algorithms are growing exponentially and soon (if not already) everything you ever sent anywhere to anyone can be connected and traced to you. </p>
<p>What people in positions of power do with that information in the future is anyones guess.</p>
<p>As I said, I don&rsquo;t believe this is a black/white, left/right, conservative/liberal issue. It&rsquo;s merely about collecting information that can be used against you when the time comes by people who don&rsquo;t like your views. And those people can be liberal or conservative; it&rsquo;s all about the potential of abusing power.</p>

But then again, I&rsquo;m just old enough, angry enough and fed up enough to tell anyone who cares to listen exactly what I think and what my views are. Lucky I don&rsquo;t need a job right now huh?</p>

		<p>I have always been very careful not to use my real name online and to be mindful of posting personal email addresses anywhere that have been shared with coworkers. The power of the Google must be respected.</p>
<p>The whole real name social networking thing is crazy, people reveal their quirks and interests and odd friends/contacts to the whole world. Professional networks are one thing but your real identity and your internet persuits should never ever cross.</p>

		<p>Well, if folks are smart they would use social networking sites deliberately to polish their image and do their trash talking only in person. On the other hand, how can you prevent your friends and enemies from putting incriminating stuff about you on the web? In the Internet Age, it&rsquo;s best to have no friends and a very common name, like&hellip;James Smith. Soon there will be consulting companies telling you how to achieve total John Doe status.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why you should use <a href="http://www.anonymizer.com/" rel="nofollow">Anonymizer</a> or other anonymous proxy when surfing the Web. (I just visited the &#8220;find IP address&#8221; link, and all the parameters came up &#8220;anonymous proxy&#8221; or &#8220;unknown.&#8221;) You should also get <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3173/" rel="nofollow">this Firefox extension</a> to thwart search engine profiling and this one to block Web analytics and ad networks.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, of course, that all personal social networking sites should be avoided like the plague.</p>

		<p>I remember in 2000 I was at a bar with an internet professional. I asked him about the possibility of searching for a person by their image. He assured me that such a thing was impossible. Now the technology is available and free at sites like tineye and google similar images. </p>
<p>My point is that technology evolves in unexpected ways. Putting a lot of personal information on the internet doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea to me.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve expected this sort of thing for years, and still post under my own name.  My reasoning is that if a company wants to screen out conservative whites as potential hires, then their management consists of politically-correct moonbats I would not be happy working for.  Working for jerks for six years gave me a blood-pressure of 175/105 by my 31st birthday.  Now that it&rsquo;s back down to the same 90/45 I had in high school, I&rsquo;m not keen on a return to hypertension.<br>
