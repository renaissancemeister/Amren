			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Poulter, Daily Mail, September 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 70 per cent of the New Zealand lamb sold in Britain comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label.</p>
<p>All the slaughtermen in these establishments must be Muslim and say a prayer when making the cut across the animal&rsquo;s throat which kills it.</p>
<p>The New Zealand meat industry has taken the step to ensure its lamb can be sold in Muslim markets round the world.</p>
<p>It emerged last week that British restaurant chains and venues such as Wembley and Ascot are serving up different types of halal meat without telling customers.</p>
<p>In conventional slaughterhouses, animals are stunned before they are killed by having their throats cut. However, in most Muslim countries, halal means the animals must not be stunned first.</p>
<p>The trade body Beef &amp; Lamb New Zealand said the form of halal slaughter used there does allow for the animals to be stunned.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;In New Zealand the process for halal slaughter is virtually the same as for non-halal slaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said there was no need to label the meat as halal on animal welfare grounds and it would too expensive to introduce labelling simply to provide the information.<br>

<p>Lol!</p>
<p>They rightly concluded that most whites would boycott anything labelled &#8216;halal&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Just the image of an animal being killed and drained by a prayer-spouting, knife-wielding Muslim is enough to turn anyone off.</p>

		<p>whats wrong with eating halal meat? I personally could care less. The question or issue isnt the meat or practice. It is where and why and how do we stop it or overcome it ect. If I went to the middle east I would be more than happy to try their food and culture. I think I made my point&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Where is ours?</p>

		<p>This could not occur in the U.S.?</p>
<p>This is a caste system? Is that the right term? You must have a Muslim do the cutting because ONLY a Muslim can say the prayer that accompanies the throat slitting? Is that right? I know they have slaughterhouses already that do the halal stuff, but that is a very small minority of the slaughterhouses in this country, right?</p>
<p>And only now this is all coming out in England. The English are ONLY NOW finding out that this has been done to them behind their backs. For a very small portion of the society, to make them feel &#8220;at home&#8221;, all sorts of absurd things are being done - - and none of it is working!</p>

		<p>The British government claims that there are &#8216;only&rsquo; 1.5 million muslims in Britain.<br>
 As evidenced from this story, this simply cannot be true.New Zealand is a very big exporter of lamb to Britain, Britain being a key market for that product.If the muslim population of Britain was negligible, then obviously, then obviously, by default, lamb exported to Britain would all be non-halal.</p>

		<p>Good article.</p>
<p>We need to get White Western animal rights activist at war with Muslim immigrants who abuse animals. Brigitte Bardot did a good job of this a few years back and the lying PC media was forced to take the side of the animal abusing Muslims and persecute the great French film star for being &#8220;Racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since we are going to be persecuted for being &#8220;RACIST&#8221; for just about anything we say in defense of our people, our culture, we might as well pick issues where our accusers are forced to take the side of animal abusers, women abusers, environment abusers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see pompous PC anti racist Liberal types have to defend things like Female Genital Mutilation, honor killings, stoning of adulterers, killing gays etc.</p>

		<p>It didn&rsquo;t occur to me before, but I suppose this means that they can only employ Muslims.  So at this point, that would mean that 70% of the jobs in this industry are Muslims, and that can&rsquo;t change, because the rules of Halal aren&rsquo;t going to change.</p>

		<p>In reply to the previous poster:<br>
Only the person killing the lambs needs to be Muslim, not the other workers of the slaughterhouse.</p>

		<p>INSIDER INFORMATION:</p>
<p>A New Zealander, whom I met while in Riyadh, who was working for the meat export trade told me this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting a &#8216;HALAL&rsquo; certificate is a matter of paying money and putting a few Muslims on the payroll.&#8221;</p>
