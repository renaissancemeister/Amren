			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diana West, dianawest.net, September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} [The] extraordinary global campaign against this stunt [burning a stack of Qurans] is yet another concerted effort, aided by an army&rsquo;s worth of useful fools, to bring our constitutional republic into conformance with Islamic law.</p>
<p>Islam demands &#8220;respect&#8221; with an intensity and strategic purpose well beyond other beliefs. (Still) don&rsquo;t believe me? For indelible culture contrast, imagine the worldwide body count in reaction to a hypothetical NEA-funded project entitled &#8220;Piss Mohammed,&#8221; or the absence of a worldwide body count in reaction to the Army&rsquo;s actual decision to discard and burn a bunch of Bibles on a U.S. base in Afghanistan last year for fear of offending Muslims in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan  &mdash;  a land where Christian converts (Abdul Rahman) and promoters of (minimal) women&rsquo;s rights (Sayed Pervez Kambakhsh) must flee with their lives, by the way.</p>
<p>{snip} Islam in fact means exempting this religious-political ideology from &#8220;slander,&#8221; &#8220;defamation,&#8221; any mockery, criticism, analysis, resistance, denunciation or rejection  &mdash;  or else. And we all know what &#8220;or else&#8221; means  &mdash;  or else murder and mayhem will convulse some region where Muslims live, leaving behind a permanent threat of death to non-repentant &#8220;offenders.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Islam is demanding, then, is a separate speech code for itself. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} That [Islamic] narrative, or rationale, tells us that burning a Quran causes murder and mayhem, putting our troops, our citizens, our cities and our interests at increased risk. In this narrative, the actual bad actors are absolved of both volition and blame. Similarly, drawing cartoons of Muhammad (Kurt Westergaard, Lars Vilks)  &mdash;  or not drawing cartoons of Muhammad (&#8220;South Park&#8221;)  &mdash;  sermonizing about violence within Islam (the Pope), and critiquing Islam (Geert Wilders&rsquo; &#8220;Fitna&#8221;) are increasingly viewed as unacceptably &#8220;insensitive&#8221; and &#8220;disrespectful&#8221; provocations in Western society, regardless of their free-speech protections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Instead, of course, they [inanimate objects] go down in history as a kind of murderer and victim, with the non-Islamic world assuming all responsibility  &mdash;  all guilt  &mdash;  for the actions of barbarians who pillage and kill at the drop of, well, a Quran. This is rank capitulation to dhimmitude, the non-Islamic state of deference to Islamic law, {snip}.</p>
<p>Repeat after me: The Constitution trumps Islamic law.<br>

		<p>Well spake, Ms. West.  Mockery, ridicule, and contempt for all other religions in &#8220;the West&#8221; is both allowable and routine, particularly in the case of Christianity and its more devout practitioners, fundamentalists and Catholics.</p>
<p>Only Islam is exempt, not because it&rsquo;s above criticism, but because its practitioners threaten violence against infidels, to include murder.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all supposed to feign shock and outrage that a perhaps  rather eccentric Christian minister proposes to burn a stack of Korans.  Indeed, were Muslims to threaten retaliation by spreading feces and urine on a pile of Bibles, everybody would breathe a sigh of relief and congratulate the Muslims on their noble show of &#8220;restraint.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, progressives the world over try to pass off simple cowardice as &#8220;true courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Repeat after me:  Demography is destiny. </p>
<p>Repeat after me:  The Constitution will only trump Sha&rsquo;ria Law if the historical racial demographics associated with said Constitution is far greater than the Muslim demographic in our country&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Other than that, Miss West hits on an important point:  Terrorism is a tactic;  Implementation of Sha&rsquo;ria is the ultimate end game.  Muslims will drop terrorism if it becomes counterproductive to the ultimate end game   &mdash;   They will then shift tactics to infiltrating the legitimate political system through peaceful means, and, taqqiya-like, engage in two-faced double-talking pseudo-tolerant rhetoric about &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;our rights&#8221; to snooker dorky liberal do-gooder (not hard to do), then drop the Sha&rsquo;ria hammer (at first, only among Muslims, then later on top of everyone) when they have enough power, either on their own or through white liberal proxies.</p>

		<p>If Islam is really a religions of peace (and of course it&rsquo;s not), why is everyone warning of dire consequences if their Koran is burned?  </p>
<p>Christians never went on a murderous rampage as a result of some &#8220;artists&#8221; putting a crucifix in urine, or having a picture of Virgin Mary surrounded by cow dung.  </p>
<p>Also Jews have had their holy books burned in the past.  But they never went on killing sprees as a result.  </p>
<p>So why do we walk on eggshells with these Muslims?  Our troops in Afghanistan are in a war zone, so there will always be danger from insurgents.  But General Petraeus never advocated bringing them all home.  </p>
<p>None of this would be an issue if we didn&rsquo;t have these people in Western countries.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Repeat after me: The Constitution trumps Islamic law.&#8221; - Close! While I agree with the rest of the article, I believe the author has an incorrect perception regarding the constitution.  In order for a constitution to have meaning (and to trump all others), you have to have a population of people who will protect and follow the constitutions&rsquo; guidance, and defend it and society from infringement by others. The Islamists have their own constitution (the Koran) which they follow and put above the U.S. constitution. That we allow those who follow the social-political-legal-religious code of Islam to stay in our Country is in itself and act of treason against our Nation.  The Islamists aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong in their world view, and the blame falls to us for letting them in to spread their influence.</p>

We hear and read reports about airline bombers, 9/11, London bus bombings, Madrid train bombing, suicide bombers in Africa and the Middle East, attacks on American service men, burning churches with Christians inside, burning Bibles etc&hellip; and with each report, Muslims insist they&rsquo;re THE pre-eminent religion of peace. The underhanded surprise attacks on the innocent continue and our elected leaders bow to Muslims to assure them WE are not a threat to them. And it&rsquo;s true. We are NOT a threat to Muslims. We are their sitting ducks.</p>

		<p>The pandering from Obama, the phone call from Gates, and the whining from Petraeus does nothing but prostrate this country to the muslims. Would Obama have us running scared from them?</p>
<p>I fought in Iraq; trust me when I say the average line troop is not the least bit scared that the hajjis will get hyper over burned korans. I can guarantee you the attitude is &#8220;Fine, let them get worked up. We&rsquo;ll send them straight to allah.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Islam is a cult and Muslims are not prepared for the republic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, North Africans are unacceptable in white society and as racially mixed people they should atleast be responsible to know it on top of their want for money.                    </p>
<p> If Muslims remain in the United States, Islam&rsquo;s highest contribution to the west will be no more than a miscegenated United States marked by crime and unable to surface economically because its only strength is its over gorge and the will to intimidate the citizenry in an attempt to maintain it.</p>
<p>The irony of this episode against one pastors right to exercise his freedom on the anniversary of the bombing of the world trade center is proof that our government has handed over the helm to the corporations and cut short the defense of the American people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Muslims demand special treatment for Islam &mdash; or else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muslims kill whites, burn the US flag, commit terrorism everywhere in the world and are the most overzealous, unreasonable hateful fanatics on planet earth.  </p>
<p>But they require that they and their koran be treated as things of special importance, and if they are not, they will kill anyone or any group that they feel deserves it.</p>
<p>Tonight on the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor, Fox was showing Muslims trampling/burning the US flag, screaming death threats, and all the while O&rsquo;Reilly was denouncing the Pastor in Florida who wants to burn the koran as a nut or a kook, never once condemning the pictures flashing on the screen depicting outrageous muslim violence, intolerance and plain unadulterated hate.</p>
<p>In fact, O&rsquo;Reilly and a bunch of US elites were voicing their fear of muslim violence and killings.  Can there be any better way to encourage these hateful nut cases to do more of the same everytime the tiniest issue presents itself?</p>
<p>The US empire has finally turned cowardly and has run up a white flag begging for muslim mercy.</p>

		<p>Ah, but THEY say that Allah&rsquo;s law trumps man&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>And therein lies the nub. We disagree.</p>
<p><br>
PS. QD has it right: &#8220;Demography is destiny&#8221;, and it will ultimately trump all else. Also &#8220;terrorism is a tactic&#8221; indeed.  It has proven to be, for them, a very successful tactic  (we don&rsquo;t know quite how to respond).  And so too, I might add, is zealotry; intensity of zealotry can compensate for lack of numbers.</p>
<p>PPS. I disapprove of burning peoples&rsquo; holy books   &mdash;   of whatever religion.  What&rsquo;s the point? What possible benefit can come of this? It only incites hatred and provokes violence, and gains us nothing. Deportation would be another matter, but burning a book accomplishes zilch.</p>
<p>But in the end all, of this is moot, as it will ultimately come down to a matter of numbers (plus force and willingness to use it). At present, their numbers are mushrooming while ours are dwindling. Yes, demography is destiny!</p>

		<p>Islam is far more than just a religion. It is a code of laws, a social/legal system, and an entire way of life.</p>
<p>Our constitution, as written, was unprepared to deal with something like Islam.  In trying to be fair to all and to ensure freedom of conscience and speech, we are defenseless before it.</p>

		<p>There were Islamofascist precursors in the Bible, too. When the hero Gideon tore down his dad&rsquo;s altar to Baal, they insisted that Gideon die.<br>
 <br>
His dad, however, had second thoughts about that stupid altar, and confounded them: &#8220;If Baal is a god, let him contend for himself since his altar has been torn down&#8221; (Judges 6:31). </p>
<p>If Allah is an all-powerful &ldquo;god�?, let him contend for himself. Who needs Islamofascist thugs to shriek, burn, and murder to restore his &#8220;honor&#8221;? He should ignore the insults as not worth the trouble, as does the true God of the Bible. Allah isn&rsquo;t worth worshiping.<br>
  <br>
Islamists who threaten violence are blackmailers and bullies. Murder mysteries make short work of blackmailers. In real life, rulers should terrorize evil people, and not bear the sword in vain (Rom. 13:3, 4). But our rulers look as ineffective as a teacher who admonishes the kids to always give in to the bully, instead of stopping him. <br>

		<p>Psychologically, Islam to some people can be overpowering.  In particular when considering modern day multiculturalism.</p>
<p>There is this overriding political correctness that has seeped into all Western societies where we aren&rsquo;t supposed to offend anyone, regardless of how offensive they may be to us.  The civil rights movement is somewhat in the same vein.  It&rsquo;s this constant complaint that you are somehow discriminating against us and making us feel different or inferior to you.  And that&rsquo;s not allowed.  You need to accept our beliefs and even encourage them as proper to your family and others.</p>
<p>If not, then we will intimidate you through fear of personal harm, political pressure or societal pressure so that you will yield and let us have what we want.</p>
<p>That constant psychological pressure coming from multiple fronts is extremely difficult for people to deal with.  Most people would rather just get along.</p>
<p>In the end what you have is a transformation from Western laws and values to those of Islam.    </p>

		<p>From my perspective, burning a pile of Korans today isn&rsquo;t really offensive, because most were mass produced for profit by a printing company somewhere that Muslims neither control nor operate. I challenge a scriptorum to hand produce as many of these books as there are Muslims in the world today&hellip;a near impossibility.</p>
<p>Burning books in the days of antiquity was so outrageous because there were SO FEW of them to go around that the information contained therein, either valued or not, was simply lost to the flames of indifference.</p>
<p>Even the Muslims have found use of today&rsquo;s internet, an advanced contrivance where mass information can be stored redundantly and shared rapidly on a scale never imagined before.<br>

		<p>Liberals (i.e. Marxists) defense of Islam using our own Constitution must be the greatest in high irony ever. Perhaps their affinity for the religion of peace stems from the fact that Liberals actually respect the Muslims ability to lie, double talk, and shift the topic of conversation in order to achieve their goals. Indeed, they have a lot in common. </p>

		<p>When American white men caved into the demands  of black militants and their supporters, they manifested their weakness to non-White men all over the world. Weakness and wealth are a great attraction to normal men. It is no surprise to me that such men are flocking to the U.S. to take advantage of the juicy pickings available. It&rsquo;s not only Muslims from the middle east, but Hispanics from South America, Asians from China and Indochina, Indians from India, blacks from Africa, etc.,etc. Each group may use different tactics, but their goals are the same: loot while there&rsquo;s still something left to loot.</p>

		<p>Wrong.  Only courage trumps tyranny.  Not pieces of paper.</p>
<p>The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t trump anything unless we as a nation have the courage, the committment and yes, the faith, to make it mean what it is supposed to mean.  Reality disabuses us of this notion that the Constitution is a magical cloak that we wrap ourselves in for infinite protection.  The barbarians of Ishmael&rsquo;s clan care not for our superstitions in comparison to their own. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Well then&hellip; look at how the world works in most places.  It&rsquo;s the law of the gun and the sword.</p>
<p>We give the Muslims about 50 more years, unimpeded.  Not only will they TRUMP us, they will remove our seat at the playing table.  They will trump the USA out of existence, along with the rest of Western Civilization.</p>

		<p>The MSM belligerently refuse to see the irony of condemning the pastor&rsquo;s right to burn a koran and condemning Americans who wish to not see a victory mosque built at ground zero.  I do think, as others have pointed out, that it would do to tone down the koran burning a couple of notches.  Why not, as others have pointed out, burn xerox copies of pages from the koran.  The reaction would be the same  &mdash;  muslims would riot and commit acts of violence  &mdash;  but the excuse for drawing moral equivalence would be muted.  Certainly, the media would feign as much outrage  &mdash;  &#8220;my god, they may as well but burning a koran!&#8221;  &mdash;  but people with brains, who could be swayed, might be.  I, personally, am doing what I consider to be my part in provoking outrage in the islamic world:</p>

		<p>The Constitution does not trump Islam. Bombs and bullets do. Islam is perpetual war, genocide and oppression against us. There can be no compromises, and if they cannot handle some Qurans being burned, that&rsquo;s their problem. Islam is more than a dangerous cult, it&rsquo;s a twisted political system and way of life that abuses and kills it&rsquo;s followers as well as non-Muslims.</p>

		<p>the Muslims expect to win the current clash of civilizations as for a very simple reason:</p>
<p>while they are fighting to win, most Europeans worldwide have already surrendered, because they are locked in denial: <br>
the more power and territory the Muslims win, the more white emit gibberish about multiculturalism and religious tolerance (i.e. calling the mosque at Ground Zero &#8220;a community center&#8221;: only PC idiots believe in fixing the world via vocabulary choices).</p>
<p>while our military is trying to get Afghanistan sorted, the Muslims are setting up households throughout the European Union and North America.</p>
<p>not only is this invasion unopposed, it is being encouraged as a matter of government policy.</p>
<p>the Muslims regard Western civilization as flimsy, cowardly, consumerist, undisciplined, narcissistic, infantile, and effeminate.</p>

<p>unfortunately, much of this is correct, and Europeans worldwide are going to have to pull themselves together and show some spine if we want to survive as a race.</p>

		<p>Comment: A symbolic logic problem: </p>
<p>Person A1: Preacher who burns a Koran to make a point. </p>
<p>Person B1: Some American other than person A1. </p>
<p>Person C1: A fictitious muslim who, because he is enraged by the actions of person A1, murders person B1. </p>
<p>If you believe that A1 is responsible for the death of B1, then, to be logically consistent, you must also believe the following: </p>
<p>Person A2: NEA funded artist who makes a piece of &#8220;art&#8221; involving a crucifix submerged in urine to make a point (and get an NEA grant). </p>
<p>Person B2: Some emo hipster somewhere, someone other than person A2. </p>
<p>Person C2: A fictitious Christian who, because he is enraged by the actions of person A2, murders person B2. </p>
<p>Both are logically equivalent scenarios. Only the religions of persons C1 and C2 have changed, but I don&rsquo;t recall the POTUS, Bush Sr. at the time, sending FBI men to &#8220;talk to&#8221; the artist, Andres Serrano BTW, who made &#8220;Christ in Urine&#8221; out of fear of a potential person C2 killing person B2; even though that was exactly the justification for &#8220;talking to&#8221; the FL preacher. In fact, that artist was operating on an NEA grant. To be logically consistent, then the FL preacher who plans to burn the Koran should get an NEA grant too. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you agree or approve of the actions of persons A1 or A2, if you believe that A1 would be responsible for the death of B1 at the hands of C1, then, if you are a rational person, you have to believe that person A2 would be responsible for the death of B2 at the hands of C2. You&rsquo;re also an enabler of evil, but that&rsquo;s another issue. At least, you&rsquo;re logical. </p>
<p>But, if you believe, as I do, that the only criminals in these examples are persons C1 and C2, and that A1 and A2 are merely obnoxious people who are covered under first amendment protection but shouldn&rsquo;t be given government grants to express their own personally favored religious bigotries, then that is also logically consistent and makes you a proponent of free speech and smaller government. Congrats.</p>
<p>But if you are the kind of person who thinks that the FBI should be sent to &#8220;talk to&#8221; person A1 because he plans to defile a muslim religious icon but that person A2 should get financial support from the government to defile a Christian icon, then you are not a rational person but merely subjectively anti-Christian or subjectively pro-muslim, probably because you&rsquo;re not afraid of Christians but you&rsquo;ve been successfully cowed by muslims.</p>

		<p>They simply don&rsquo;t belong in the west.  Their culture is not compatible with ours, so long as they take Islam seriously. </p>
<p>BTW, Rev. Jones, like the rest of us, can burn any book he wants, any time he wants. There&rsquo;s no need to consult a calendar or alert the media.  If he has a camera ready, he can post the book burning on YouTube &amp; see if anyone is interested in watching.  If he has a pile of them, he can burn one every day until they run out. So can each one of us.  Why is this an issue anyway?</p>

		<p>Reply to AvgDude:</p>
<p>The difference between C1 and C2 is that, while A1 and A2 are exercising free speech as American citizens, American troops are actively killing hundreds of thousands of fellow members of C1&rsquo;s religion over the last decade, while American troops are not actively killing fellow members of C2&rsquo;s religion. That puts A1&rsquo;s free speech in a different context to A2&rsquo;s free speech. There is no danger that America could appear to endorse A2&rsquo;s message, but A1&rsquo;s message appears to be endorsed by the actions of the American troops. Therefore there IS a need to categorically condemn A1&rsquo;s message, whereas there is no need to condemn A2&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&#8220;you are not a rational person but merely subjectively anti-Christian or subjectively pro-muslim&#8221;</p>
<p>No. If American troops were bombing Christian countries, I would support condemnation of A2&rsquo;s message also. Understanding that Muslim countries are the innocent victims of American military aggression is not being &#8216;pro-Muslim&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>You can burn and desecrate the American flag, a copy of the Constitution,the Declaration of Independence, any book, any picture, and of course, the bible. </p>
<p>This country&rsquo;s First Amendment protects such conduct.</p>
<p>EXCEPT!</p>
<p>One must never desecrate or even say anything negative about either Muslims or the Koran. Hello? Anyone ever heard about the concept of the First Amendment or equal protection?</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t it ever occurred to anyone that by allowing disparate treatment for any group [in this country] everything that this country [is suppose] to stand for is violated? That has long been my beef about affirmative action. </p>
<p>What about that gibberish: &#8220;I disagree with what you say but I shall defend to the death your right to say it?&#8221; Well hello? That sure doesn&rsquo;t apply to some loony tune preacher in Florida does it? </p>
<p>But rest assured, if it ever gets to this Supreme Court the court will find away to write around the issue with some kind of five to four plurality decision, with all kinds of concurring in parts, dissenting in parts,references to case law, to learned treatises, to cross references etc. etc. etc. and in a language that only a drunk Harvard Law professor, replete with his copy of Blacks Law, would understand. </p>
<p>There is exactly one and only one thing that Muslim Terrorists understand and it sure as hell ain&rsquo;t turning the other cheek! </p>

So, Islam demands &#8220;respect&#8221; with an intensity and strategic purpose well beyond other beliefs, as does Judaism. It&rsquo;s time to dump all these desert dwelling religions and return to our roots.</p>
<p>Constitutional law should be SUPREME. </p>
<p>As far as religion goes, I prefer the pagan beliefs of our Greco-Roman-Germanic forefathers myself.</p>

<p>Yes, he can. But SHOULD he? The question is: <i>is it wise? </i> There&rsquo;s no doubting that it&rsquo;s legal. But what purpose is served?  Is it prudent, is it sensible? </p>
<p>We can do many things that are legal but which are stupid. There is no law against being stupid.</p>
<p>I can  insult my neighbors, yell at their kids, and chase their dog. But is it wise?  Not if I want to get along with them and have peace on the street. </p>
<p>Moslems, unfortunately, are quite fanatical about their precious but primitive beliefs. And in this world they are likely to make life hell for OTHER people, somewhere else, completely uninvolved people, in retaliation for the stupid (if fully legal) behavior of some tactless jerks here. Thus, it is other people who will suffer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard for me to side with one religious fanatic against other religious fanatics. Let them battle it out between themselves, but keep me out of it.</p>
<p>We do need someone to stand up for us and champion the values of the West, in an intelligent way; but a fundamentalist preacher is hardly the one. I&rsquo;m sure that my reasons for opposing Islam are quite different from those of Rev. Jones. And when it comes to race, if he ever had a thought on the subject, he is probably on the side of Islam.</p>
<p>In this squabble between fanatics, I have no sympathy for either side.   </p>
<p>Burning those Korans is not illegal, but it is tasteless and stupid. And innocent Christians somewhere are going to suffer.</p>

		<p>Anonymous: You cannot build a logical argument upon a fallacy.</p>
<p>You are starting with the fallacy that muslim countries are the innocent victims of American agression. I&rsquo;m not sure who your debate coach was, but you must have missed the day they taught that arguments must be based upon provable information; i.e. facts.</p>
<p>In the early grades, we often are taught a lesson in telling &#8220;fact&#8221; from &#8220;opinion&#8221; by marking an &#8220;O&#8221; or an &#8220;F&#8221; next to a statement. You would have failed that beginning exercise.<br>
Your &#8220;agression&#8221; statement is an opinion, not a fact.</p>

<p>WRONG! let&rsquo;s make this clear, we DO KNOW HOW TO RESPOND, to the muslim terrorists AND to the narco terrorists, BUT our ROE and Christianity will not allow us to. Get rid of the ROE, stop fighting this war with continental army tactics and get serious about KILLING our enemies, STOP making nice with them, STOP trying to make them see reason, STOP trying to appease them and STOP STOPPING us from killing them, and STOP letting them into America.</p>

		<p>I had been expecting the muslims to do something mean in America on 9-11 and nothing happened of note. I suspect that the reason for this relative tranquility is that the Saudis said NO! Their muslim take over of the U.S. is going so smoothly, they didn&rsquo;t want to upset things again&hellip;.and it IS going smoothly.</p>

		<p>A newspaper article we would NOT have seen in 1943.</p>
<p>Dateline United Press December 5th, 1943. Today, President Roosevelt called on the members of the Woman&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union in Devenport, Iowa not to burn a Japanese Flag in remembrance of Pearl Harbor. The flag was captured by Lcpl. John Olafson USMC, during the campaign at Guadalcanal. Lcpl Olafson is the son of Myrtle Olafson, treasurer of this chapter of the WCTU. The Japanese ambassador, speaking through the Swiss Embassy  warned US troops of the dire consequences that would befall them if the Japanese nation &#8220;lost face&#8221; due to this action. The Attorney General of the United States, Francis Biddle is currently in consultation with John M. Rankin, the attorney General for the state of Iowa over the legality of this celebration. </p>
