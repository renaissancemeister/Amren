<h1>Bolivian President Evo Morales Tells Obama &#8216;Stop Deporting Immigrants&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Annie Correal, Feet in Two Worlds, September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As heads of state gathered here to attend the United Nations General Assembly, Bolivian President Evo Morales ended a speech at Hunter College on Monday by calling on President Barack Obama to stop &#8220;expelling&#8221; Latin American immigrants who are trying to eke out a living.<blockquote> &#8220;Here there&rsquo;s a lot of talk about policies that aim to expel immigrants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are deep asymmetries between countries, between continents, so of course our brothers in Latin America come here to improve their economic situation. But our brothers who come to the U.S., to Europe, to survive, to reach a better station in life, they are thrown out. What kind of policy is that?&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Morales&rsquo; message: &#8220;I call on President Obama to halt these policies that aim to deport the Latin American people here, because we all have the same rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Morales was at Hunter to promote his biography, recently translated into English. {snip} said the indigenous Morales, &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that one discriminated party would discriminate against another.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Evo Morales was born to a poor indigenous family in the high plains of Bolivia, and grew up to be a union organizer who represented coca farmers. His rise to power was characterized by fierce opposition, including detention and torture in Bolivia, and more recently, ridicule abroad, where he has been called a puppet of Hugo Chavez. His policies have sought to nationalize natural resources and basic services, and The New York Times described his diplomatic relationship with Washington as &#8220;tense.&#8221; In an 2009 article, the NYT said it &#8220;might be the worst in the hemisphere, except for the one with Cuba.&#8221;</p>

<p>If they came here peacefully, orderly and legally, they would not be thrown out.</p>
<p>I know that is hard to understand for some.</p>

		<p>To see how Whites will bow down and back peddle to any race but their own I came across this video of a Republican candidate trying to &#8220;explain&#8221; his &#8220;racist&#8221; views. Look and listen to that interviewer and his aggressive rant!  The GOP is totally against this &#8220;racist&#8221; candidate. So much for the GOP and for any politician telling the truths. </p>
<p>So, yes, Evo Morales,  let us bring in millions more legal and illegal immigrants since the politicians, political parties and Whites are so neutered when it comes to defending the White race.</p>

		<p>Hasn&rsquo;t this moron gotten the memo yet? There ARE no jobs here! All the textile mills in small NC towns went south of the border or overseas. The US is on the verge of bankruptcy. What part of this can&rsquo;t these people understand? It&rsquo;s not OUR job to employee the world. Fix your own damn countries and they wouldn&rsquo;t have to &#8220;eke&#8221; out a living elsewhere! But again, that just makes too much sense doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Will the US ever have a leader who will say, &#8220;This is it? My first act as President will be to close the borders and put a moratorium on ALL immigration for ten years. Anyone in this country without paper must leave. You have 30 days. If you don&rsquo;t, you will be serving jail time,then be deported. I will see to it that the people of this country have jobs and our economy is thriving once more before anyone else is allowed in. I intend to put Americans first for a change.&#8221; Now, that&rsquo;s the change we all hoped for.</p>

		<p>So I can travel to Bolivia with out a visa, stay as long as I want, take free courses at universities that offer free tuition to Bolivian citizens, and use the heath care system at will?(I know,who would want to use their system. But there probably is  a competent doctor in that perpetually poor and unsuccessful nation.). </p>
<p>Bolivia&rsquo;s real problem is it has too many dull-witted Indians,and not enough European- descended residents, like Argentina or Chile.</p>

		<p>Another hypocritical exercise for the &#8220;Elite&#8221; Latin Americans to rid themselves of their underclass by sending them to us as do the Mexican elite.<br>
At least Castro was honest about it when he shipped the Marielitos from his Manicomios and Cárceles to Florida.<br>
It&rsquo;s a win win scenario. They get rid of their underclass and destroy us at the same time; the latter being their ultimate goal and all with the conscious or unconscious cooperation of OUR so called &#8220;elected&#8221; leaders. </p>

<p>It is the leaders of Latin American countries and the people of those countries that are responsible for being able to have a better life&hellip; in their OWN countries. THEY are not our responsibility.</p>

<p>There are countries people want to leave; and there are countries people want to get into. </p>
<p>And there are REASONS why which ones are which. </p>
<p>Despite their hatred of the anglo, every Bolivian   &mdash;   including Senor Moralies   &mdash;   would LOVE to get into the US. </p>
<p>The last Americans to go to Bolivia, however, were Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. </p>
<p>And we all know what happened to them&hellip;</p>

		<p>Memo to Bolivian President Evo Moron-es:</p>
<p>President Obama can&rsquo;t &#8220;stop deporting immigrants.&#8221;  You can&rsquo;t stop something that you never started to begin with.</p>
<p>Deportation?  Yeah, that&rsquo;s about as funny as &#8220;border.&#8221;</p>
