<h1>Speech of Filip DeWinter of the Vlaams Belang on September 11, 2010</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Filip Dewinter, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> September 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Let us first of all start with a minute of silence for all the victims of the 9/11 attacks, nine years ago.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The 2.750 fatalities in New York (the people in the Twin Towers, the passengers on the planes and the more than 400 firemen and police officers).</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The 184 victims of the attack on the Pentagon.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  The 40 victims of United 93.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for attending this protest demonstration against the building of an Islamic centre with a mosque near Ground Zero, the place where on 11 September 2001 almost 3.000 people lost their lives after the largest Islamic terror attack ever.</p>
<p>The American President Barack Obama  &mdash;  or should I say Barack Hussein Obama?  &mdash;  defended the construction of this mega mosque. Obama said that &#8220;Ground Zero is indeed sacred ground&#8221;, but he affirmed &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; as an essential American value. I do not oppose freedom of religion. But this form of freedom of religion gives everyone the right to build any kind of religious construction wherever they want.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Today, we are told that a mosque next to Ground Zero should be tolerated because of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I wonder what the reaction of the politically correct establishment would be if:</p>
<p>  &mdash;   a Shinto shrine in remembrance of the Japanese WW II victims would be built near Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>  &mdash;   a Serbian orthodox church would be constructed near the mass graves in Srebrenica, Bosnia.</p>
<p>What would the Islamic world say if a church were to be built near the Kaaba in Mecca? What&rsquo;s more is that the city of Mecca is forbidden ground for non-Muslims. The hypocrisy in the Islamic world about the mosque near Ground Zero is appalling.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>The Muslim community has no right to speak of open-mindedness, tolerance, and freedom of religion. In countries as Iran, Indonesia, and Sudan, Christian and other religious minorities are being sentenced and even murdered. In Saudi-Arabia, Iran, Mauretania, Sudan, and Malaysia, conversions to other religions than Islam are sentenced with the death penalty. In Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, and Egypt, someone who converts himself to Christianity can be given severe sentences, such as the nullification of marriage, the annulment of citizenship, the confiscation of identity documents, and the loss of economic and social rights. In countries such as Algeria, Saudi Arabia, or the Maldives, even possessing a Bible or wearing a cross is punishable. The Muslim world has to stop giving the West lessons in democracy and freedom of speech! Islam&rsquo;s green fascism contradicts every form of freedom of assembly, freedom of press, freedom of speech,  and freedom of religion.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>The construction of a mosque near the place where thousands of people were killed in the name of Islam is simply unacceptable. It is a slap in the face of all the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their surviving relatives.</p>
<p>Let there be no doubt whatsoever. The building of a mosque near Ground Zero is nothing more than a provocation that shows how much the power of Islam has increased, to the extent that it is even capable of building a gigantic Islamic centre near the sacred ground of 9/11.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>The imam behind this mega mosque, Faisal Abdul Rauf, is supposed to be an example of moderate Islam that strives for peace with Christians and Jews. However, more and more evidence shows that imam Rauf does not at all aspire to peaceful coexistence, but the extension of Islam&rsquo;s power. In Arabic books and articles, he cracks down on governments that do not abide by Islamic laws and pleads for the introduction of the Sharia. A few days ago, imam Rauf said on CNN that &#8220;giving up the construction plans would in the Islamic world be regarded as a defeat of Islam,&#8221; which would lead to an &#8220;increased terror threat&#8221; against America. In other words: give us what we want or there will be new attacks. What a nerve! Furthermore, to this day it is still not known who finances the Islamic center that will cost about 100 million Euro.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Opinion polls show that two out of three Americans are opposed to the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero. The American people clearly possess more common sense than their President Barack Hussein Obama. Today, there is a protest demonstration in New York as well, where among others Geert Wilders will address the public.</p>
<p>I received a message from the president of the organization that coordinates the protest manifestation in New York, Miss Pamela Geller of SIOA (Stop Islamization of America). This is what she mailed to me: &#8220;Dear Filip: This is a good initiative in Brussels. Building the Ground Zero mosque is not an issue of religious freedom, but of resisting an effort to insult the victims of 9/11 and to establish a beachhead for political Islam and Islamic supremacism in New York. We cannot allow this. Good luck with your protest demonstration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Not only in New York and Brussels, but in other cities as well, demonstrations are being held. All these people know why they raise their voice. The Ground Zero mosque is not an isolated fact, but symbolizes the increasing arrogance and hunger for expansion of Islam in the West. In the part of the world that is controlled by Islam, however, the most fundamental human rights are not being respected, such as freedom of religion. Furthermore, Islam becomes more and more demanding in the West, for example with regard to the Islamic halal food prescriptions and the increasing presence of headscarves, veils, niqabs, and burqas in our streets.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>I would like to say that I do not agree with the pastor who wants to hold a Koran burning. We should not burn the Koran. Everyone should read that book! Than they will realize that the Koran preaches hate and violence towards every non-Muslim. The Koran is a license to kill. It is the source of inspiration for the 9/11 attacks and the manual for Muslim terrorists and fundamentalists around the globe.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Today, the American ambassador who is appointed by Barack Hussein Obama does not want to receive our delegation of senators and Flemish federal and European Members of Parliament. The embassy is officially closed. The American ambassador has no time for the allies of the USA, but President Obama does make time for the USA&rsquo;s enemies. He recently organized an Iftar halal meal in the White House, because of Ramadan. Furthermore, the American ambassador organized a similar meal in Brussels as well, on September 2nd.</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Is this naivete, electoral propaganda, or something else? The Islamic world laughs at our so-called multicultural tolerance. They laugh at us and consider our naive tolerance as a sign of weakness. Radical Islam is just like communism  &mdash;  and I quote Ronald Reagan  &mdash;  an &#8220;empire of evil.&#8221; Winston Churchill once said, &#8220;Civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism. The forces of progress clash with those of reaction. The religion of blood and war is face to face with that of peace. Luckily, the religion of peace is usually better armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>We do not want a Ground Zero mosque! The West has to remain Western and cannot be sacrificed to Islam. The American president, Barack Hussein Obama, has still not realized that Islam is a threat to the West and that concessions to Islam are quickly followed by new demands. By supporting the building of a mosque near Ground Zero, Obama shows that he is a collaborator of radical Islam. Enough is enough! With this demonstration, we make clear that we do not want a mega-mosque near Ground Zero. Stop concessions to Islam! Stop Islamization! No Ground Zero mosque!<br>

<p>You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot give white countries to non-whites and expect that things will remain the same.  They will do, what they want to do, with what WAS your country and eventually they WILL kill all of you.  </p>
