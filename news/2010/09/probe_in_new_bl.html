			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon, Washington Post, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s internal watchdog is investigating allegations that its civil rights division enforced voting laws in a racially discriminatory manner, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The review by Inspector General Glenn A. Fine is an outgrowth of the political controversy over a 2008 voter intimidation case against members of the New Black Panther Party. Some conservative lawyers, politicians and commentators have said that the civil rights division improperly narrowed that case, part of their broader allegations that the Obama Justice Department has failed to protect the civil rights of white voters.</p>
<p>The department&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility is looking into the matter, and two Republican congressmen, Frank R. Wolf (Va.) and Lamar Smith (Tex.) asked Fine to also investigate the department&rsquo;s handling of the case, according to letters the congressmen sent Fine over the summer.</p>
<p>Fine, in a letter Monday to the congressmen, wrote that his office will not investigate the New Black Panther case specifically but is initiating a broader review of how the Justice Department enforces voting rights laws.</p>
<p>The letter, released by both congressional offices, said the review will focus on what types of cases the civil rights division&rsquo;s voting section brings and whether it enforces the law &#8220;in a non-discriminatory manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But conservatives contend that the Obama administration has itself become politicized, and they have focused their ire on the New Black Panther case. Filed weeks before the Obama administration took office, it focused on two of the party&rsquo;s members who stood in front of a polling place in Philadelphia on Election Day 2008, one carrying a nightstick and identifying himself as &#8220;security.&#8221; The men were captured on video and accused of trying to discourage some people from voting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former Justice Department lawyer J. Christian Adams recently told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which held a series of hearings on the matter, that he believed the case had been narrowed because some in the civil rights division were interested in protecting only minorities.</p>

		<p>Did the Black Panthers actually prevent a white person from voting?  Has a white person stepped forward to claim that they were actually intimidated?  Ultimately these are the questions that must be answered.  </p>

		<p>Get ready for new, harsher tactics against White Humanity&rsquo;s rising and regenerated intolerance of the Diversity Privilege.</p>
<p>The stakes are epic.  White Humanity has been submerged so far down that we accept politicans who refuse to accept that our nation has borders, we work for companies who actively promote blacks while leaving us stagnant in our careers, and we keep watching blacks make millions while entertaining us in sports while the advertisers push every non white ethnic group into our homes in larger and larger numbers.</p>
<p>Even though the Tea Party will fail for lack of a racial identity, there is a rising awareness among some Whites that we have a real Race Problem that is permanent because it is natural. Our frustration level is rising as our prospects for future happiness and successful children are decreasing, and a black president is changing everything for the worse for White Humanity.</p>
<p>The Left knows that we are close to outright acceptance of Racism as a strategy of survival, and they must attack now, and hard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you will see this Black Panther business come to nothing.  It is only used now by the Republican as a vote getter, but once they get the vote and get into office, they are back to business as ususal- open borders stay open, Amensty stays an option, Affirmative Action is untouchable, and the Federal Reserve is your friend, and we will not tolerate bigots at CPAC.  They will let this story die a quiet death because it will get stuck in committee who is supposed to do nothing</p>
<p>I see not hope for us.  If things get hot in a few places, Obama will orgainze the new Civilian Army, and the Republicans will back him just to prove they aren&rsquo;t raciss.</p>

<p>OH NOW THAT JUST CAN&rsquo;T BE TRUE!  The fact that a black has NEVER and I mean NEVER been charged with a hate crime even in such cases as Newsome and Christian is just a coincidence.  Let a white man simply call a black man the N word, and it&rsquo;s a hate crime.  Let a gang of black thugs rape, mutilate, beat, terrorize two whites for days because they are WHITE, then kill them and it&rsquo;s just youthful exuberance gone wrong.  Obama has nothing to do with it.  The DOJ civil rights office is systemically anti-white and corrupt from it&rsquo;s inception, as are all agencies INSTITUTED TO FAVOR BLACKS OVER WHITE.</p>

		<p>As much as I hated having a black president, at least this will wake up more and more whites to our side.  It&rsquo;s a blessing in disguise.</p>

		<p>Let us all hope that the Justice Dept. IG investigation fails miserably. Eric Holder and the Justice Dept. racism are the true driving force behind rank and file angst in the tea party movement, the racialist elephant in the room that tea party leadership refuses to discuss.</p>
<p>I am owe a debt of gratitude to the teleprompted Messiah for tapping Holder to run Justice, Holder is the greatest recruiting tool that White Nationalism has had in over 40 yrs. He has a galvanizing effect on conservatives Sarah Palin can only fantasize about. The best part is that neither BHO or his Chief of staff see Holder for the Achilles heel he will be in 2012, and even if they did they would neva sell a brutha out. Good times.</p>

		<p>One of the dumber things Uncle Kenya did was try to cover this up.  It keeps coming back to haunt him because Americans have been taught for decades that this sort of thing is wrong for white people to do.  So suddenly saying it&rsquo;s OK for blacks sent a very loud and disturbing message across the nation.  Following it with this nut&rsquo;s iconic &#8220;I hate every iota of a cracker&#8221; and the ever cheerful &#8220;you&rsquo;re going to have to kill some crackers and their babies&#8221; speeches and Obama is soon to be forced to decide on the issue.  I doubt he will.  I bet he keeps trying to push the broom toward the rug because he&rsquo;s betting on the stupidity of Americans.  Democrats routinely bank on American ignorance, short attention spans and shorter memories.  In the information age this is no longer true.  Even the dumber Americans are waking up as they are flooded with these stories.  You can&rsquo;t even pump gas these days without media assault.  What I find most intriguing is how Obama did all this with such blatant disregard as if there was ever a chance to get away with it all.  If we have a secondary recession period, he might have a chance.  But he made the mistake of shoring up all his wealthy co-conspirators who are now turning on him.  I love when a plan falls apart!<br>

		<p>Actually he&rsquo;s a jewish Civil Rights attorny, used to own the village voice. Did all the MLK programs in the 60&rsquo;s and he said this was the worse case of voter intimidation he&rsquo;d ever seen, worse than anything he&rsquo;d seen in the south in the 60&rsquo;s. But Holder shut him down. </p>

<p>If the White has a career that he/she is interested in keeping, they dare not! Weapons and ammo (and MREs) are our friends, get them before the Obamaster and his regime make it impossible.</p>

		<p>This investigation will go absolutely nowhere, because the DOJ will simply stonewall and refuse to provide any information, even if it is subpoenaed, pretty much the way they&rsquo;ve already been doing.</p>
