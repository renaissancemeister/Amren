			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Hawley, USA Today, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many people in Latin America have requested legal visas to come to the USA, but the wait can be decades, if approval is given at all. Diversity visa programs aimed at increasing the USA&rsquo;s cultural mix are skewed against Latin America because there are so many of its people already here. All of which provides a powerful inducement to sneak in, critics of the U.S. immigration system say.</p>
<p>U.S. visa laws have changed and become so much more complex since the days of Ellis Island that it is simply impossible for many hardworking people around the world to legally immigrate to the USA, they say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration-control advocates say the system is doing its job and the true problem is that the USA cannot afford to take in more people.</p>
<p>&#8220;America is already at an unsustainable level of hyperlegal immigration,&#8221; said William Gheen, president of the Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee. &#8220;Anybody that&rsquo;s complaining about us not letting enough people in legally is full of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These days, U.S. immigrant visas are limited mostly to the educated, the affluent or people who have spouses or parents in the USA, said Gustavo Garcia, an immigration lawyer in Mexico City. If the ancestors of most Americans had tried to immigrate to the USA under today&rsquo;s rules, their American Dream would have ended before it began, Garcia said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under today&rsquo;s rules, most immigrants must be sponsored by a family member or by an employer, who must prove to the U.S. government that the immigrant has skills that are in short supply.</p>
<p>Even for those who meet the requirements for a visa, getting approval to immigrate to the USA can take 20 years or more {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, U.S. citizens trying to bring a spouse or young child to the USA can get visas for them almost immediately, said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Other people face a longer wait.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens trying to bring an adult, Mexican-born son or daughter to the USA face an 18-year wait before a visa becomes available, according to the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s monthly visa report. For a U.S. citizen trying to help a Filipino sibling immigrate, the wait is 19 years.</p>
<p>Bentley said the system works well, noting that about 1 million people legally immigrate each year and the biggest backlogs are for a handful of countries that have historically sent large numbers of people, mainly Mexico, India, South Korea, China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So how does an unskilled worker from Mexico, with no job offer and no family in the USA get to legally immigrate there?</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t, said Mike Franquinha, a Phoenix immigration lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no vehicle for these people to immigrate. It just doesn&rsquo;t exist,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>From March 2007 to March 2009, about 300,000 people either entered the USA illegally or overstayed temporary visas, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a non-partisan think tank based in Washington. Half of them were Mexicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Making more visas available for Latin America and nearby countries. The shortage of visas and the resulting 18- to 25-year wait prompt many people to enter the USA illegally, Garcia said.</p>
<p>* Reinstating Section 245(i), a provision in the immigration law that expired in 2001. It allowed spouses and children in the country illegally to stay while awaiting an immigrant visa and after paying a fine.</p>
<p>* Passing the Dream Act, which would allow children brought to the USA illegally by their parents to achieve permanent residency if they attend college or serve in the military.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The real troublemakers, said ALIPAC&rsquo;s Gheen, are employers who hire illegal immigrants, politicians who praise their contributions and authorities who make them feel welcome by, for example, offering forms and services in Spanish.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you follow the (immigration) rules, you&rsquo;re penalized; if you break the rules, you&rsquo;re rewarded,&#8221; Gheen said.</p>

		<p>Wow! USA today makes it sound like the immigration problem has been solved and no one told the rest of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;From March 2007 to March 2009, about 300,000 people either entered the USA illegally or overstayed temporary visas, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a non-partisan think tank based in Washington. Half of them were Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 150,000 illegal immigrants a year and 75,000 of them are Mexicans. I wonder how many were terrorist?</p>
<p>&#8220;The local increase in removals mirrors a national trend. Nationwide, more than 234,000 people have been deported this fiscal year compared to about 210,000 at this time last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>https://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/0807/080711seattle.htm</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see we have only 150,000 illegal immigrants a year and ICE is deporting over 200,000 a year. </p>

		<p>If the US enforced strict policies of no welfare of any kind for illegals and first generation legal immigrants, the amount of non-white immigration both legal and illegal would immediately drop to zero and a mass exodus would begin.</p>
<p>Complete collapse of the welfare system will likely have the exact same result.</p>
<p>There was little to no permanent non-white migration before welfare, despite the mexican border being wide open for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Welfare and racial problems are really the same exact issue.  Want to end all racial problems all over the world?  Dismantle welfare in every single white country.  Make it illegal and write that permanently into the constitutions of every white country.  Non-whites&hellip;.nearly 100% of them will vanish in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>They do NOT want the &#8220;opportunities&#8221; that a white nation affords them.  What they want are handouts&hellip;and ONLY handouts (the more they can funnel into the drugs, guns and the sex slave trade, the better).</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t need more immigrants, legal or not. The USA is already taking in 2 million LEGALLY a year and half receive some form of public assistance. That&rsquo;s 20 million a decade and 10 million welfare recipients a decade. No nation can take on constant legal immigration and still retain its&rsquo; culture and not be colonized not to mention we don&rsquo;t have the jobs or ecology to support this. The USA does NOT belong to the world and coming here is NOT an entitlement. These people need to stay in their own damn countries and fix them.</p>

		<p>My suggestion to simplify this admittedly unfair and complex situation is to stop all &#8220;legal immigration&#8221;, deport everyone with a green card or temporary visa(so-called) and throw anyone who employs an illegal immigrant into a labor camp keeping gas and oil right of ways in Alaska nice and clear. 24/7, 12 months a year. Free transportation and a baggie of heroin for every illegal immigrant back to their own nation.</p>
<p>Then all the would be immigrants and illegal immigrants from all origins will be equal. </p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what the Marxists, the SPLC, the ACLU, LaRaza, the NAACP, Hussein Obama,  and immigration lawyers want:  Equality. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Americans, real Americans, don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>All men are not created equal.  We need a new Constitution.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So how does and no family in the USA get to legally immigrate there?&#8221;</p>
<p>First, anybody wondering about such a proposition has to be at least a half degree above imbecility to understand the answer, which is that a nation with few jobs would not want to bring in people that are going to have to go on the public dole.</p>
<p>An unskilled worker from Mexico or the third world, with no job offer, needs to stay home and look for work there.</p>

<i>&#8220;Many people in Latin America have requested legal visas to come to the USA&#8221;</i></p>
<p>90% of humanity wants to move to the US. What makes Latin Americans special?</p>
<p>The world wants to move here for a &#8216;better life&rsquo; meaning a well subsidized life of government handouts.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of people wanting to move here for the opportunity to work to improve their station in life. The first thing they do when they get here is they&rsquo;re given directions to the local social service agencies by their &#8216;refugee resettlement&rsquo; non-governmental agency workers.  </p>

		<p>I can relate and agree with the article. I live in Medellin Colombia 3 months a year and have a girlfriend there. By the way, she is as white as any of us, pretty, educated,good white collar job, good family but not rich or poor, and speaks good english. If you met her on the street you would not think she was anything but an attractive american girl. BUT, she cant visit me here, the US goverment wont give her a visa even to visit for a week. We can get a 90 fiancee visa but only once in 2 years, and even the 90 day fiance visa takes about 9 months with loads of fees and paperwork. Unless you are in such a situation, nobody knows how frustrating and difficult this is. Even my dentist, a 45ish woman who is well to do, owns a nice house, car ect was denied a visa just for a vacation to the USA. She had had a visa but it expired, she had visited the USA 2 times before. This year she instead spent her vacation dollars in Europe, and has a bad taste for the american governmental visa policies. I went to the american embassy myself to try to talk to them and was treated like a moron, they did not give me any time to state my case, just said they could not help, next&hellip;. Our tourism industries are losing a lot of money by these policies.  I, a born and bred american also suffer because of these policies.   Kingfish     </p>

<p>Immigration and visiting are two different things. It&rsquo;s one thing if someone is going to visit. I don&rsquo;t have a problem giving someone a visa for that and if are education/welfare for citizens laws were enforced, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much danger of large numbers of peoples overstaying their visas. However, what the article was talking about was permanent immigration.</p>

		<p>&#8216;It takes an adult child of an immigrant 18 years to get through&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I am sorry but an adult child is just that, an adult and has ceased to be a ward of his parents and is self-responsible.</p>
