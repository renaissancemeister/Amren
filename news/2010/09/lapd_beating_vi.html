			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Thompson, Daily Mail (London), September 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police brutality victim Rodney King is to marry one of the jurors who awarded him over £2m in damages for the shocking assault.</p>
<p>King and Cynthia Kelley first met in a pizza restaurant hours after a jury made the civil award in 1994.</p>
<p>But as they were both married their romance remained a secret and they eventually drifted apart.</p>
<p>Four months ago King, 44, called Kelley and after they began dating again asked her to marry him.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;We hadn&rsquo;t spoken to each other for many years, and it just so happened that we reconnected. It was like we were never apart from one another.</p>
<p>&#8216;She is a godsend, a blessing in my life.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done without her in my life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can&rsquo;t wait to make her my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The $3.8m award followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers who were charged with beating the black taxi driver in 1991.</p>
<p>The assault on King was captured on video film and he became a symbol of police brutality.</p>
<p>The acquittal of the four officers in 1992 led to race riots in Los Angeles that left 55 people dead and more than 2,000 injured.</p>
<p>King later sued the city of Los Angeles and was awarded the $3.8m in damages. Over half the money is thought to have gone on legal fees.</p>
<p>Kelley was the lone black on the jury and at the time spoke of how she had to fight to get King his money.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;During deliberations, the other jurors said, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s just award him $100,000, you know he&rsquo;s just gonna blow it anyway.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since the infamous 1991 beating King struggled with a drug problem but after an appearance on a reality show celebrity rehab has not touched drugs or drink.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The $3.8m award followed the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers who were charged with beating the black taxi driver in 1991.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The assault on King was captured on video film and he became a symbol of police brutality.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not sure what they are talking about here. Are they talking about the ex-con who was drunk and on drugs and went after the cops four times with intent to do them harm?</p>
<p>The ex-con who went after the cops and even executed the Folsom roll. The technique the cons in prison teach one another to knock the cop off his feet, get in a wrestling match on the ground, take the cops gun away and then kill the cop?</p>
<p>The ex-con who laughingly pistol whipped the Korean store owner and then fell during his attacks on the cops and hit his head?</p>
<p>Is that who they are referring to?</p>

		<p>What a load of rubbish;</p>
<p>1)&#8221;As they were both married their romance remained a secret&#8221;..</p>
<p>In other words they were both guilty of committing adultery and betraying their spouses. And don&rsquo;t most married people keep &#8220;romances&#8221; outside of their marriages a &#8220;secret&#8221;?</p>
<p>2)&#8221;&hellip;awarded 3.8 million in damages. Over half the money is thought to have gone on legal fees&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Even if true, 1.6 million dollars is a fortune and should have set him up very comfortably for life. In reality King blew his money, mostly on a failed rap company.</p>
<p>3)&#8221;&hellip;the four Los Angeles police officers who were charged with beating the black taxi driver in 1991&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>No mention of Kings&rsquo; extensive criminal record and the fact he was on parole on the night in question.</p>
<p>Only the British press could print such nonsense.</p>

		<p>This is not even close to being important about Rodney King (people should ask themselves what is being covered up by tabloid stuff like this in the &#8220;news&#8221;).</p>
<p>What IS, in fact, extremely important is that, after being found 100% innocent in a fair trial (which should not have even happened), policemen were illegally tried again in a kangaroo court and sent to prison.  The fact that this extremely disturbing event did not cause white people to riot has caused the rule of law to vanish in many places in the US.</p>
<p>Instead, a tenuous existence is maintained in many places with strong de facto segregation and limited police enforcement.  There are black areas where whites can expect to go without police protection and be victimized and white areas where blacks can expect to be gunned down without mercy and barely any interest by authorities in a &#8220;self defense&#8221; context.</p>
<p>The US is ruled far more &#8220;by the gun&#8221; rather than by the law then most people realize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become much more obvious recently as the authorities seem to be losing interest in even keeping up the pretense any longer.  Or rather, seem to be too weak to even keep up the pretense any longer.  It&rsquo;s a little of both.</p>
<p>Many people worry about a US police state.  What they should worry about is its exact opposite (the collapse of centralized authority).  I cannot emphasize enough that in some places (Detroit for example) this situation is far advanced.  One step before police stations, court houses, and government buildings boarded up and abandoned.  The excuse given is lack of money.  But that is only so much nonsense.  The real reason is the state lost its grip on its sanity a long time ago.  Too many incidents like Rodney King.  The sicker the system gets, the less power it is able to effectively wield, no matter how much money, resources and manpower it has under its umbrella.</p>
<p>Pay very strict attention to the types of people who are likely to fill in the power vacuums left in the wake of this.  Where you live is extremely important now.</p>

<p>These weren&rsquo;t &#8220;race&#8221; riots, they were the usual &#8220;BLACK&#8221; riots with the usual burning, looting, robbing, raping and assaults along with the usuall murders.</p>

		<p><i>&rdquo;As they were both married their romance remained a secret&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>In other words this was a typical black marital arrangement. As Austin Powers would say, &#8220;Everyone was shagging everyone. Yeah, baby!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll always remember the image of poor &#8220;Rotney&#8221; after his &#8220;brutal beating&#8221; by the police (who were likened to the Waffen SS) standing before a bank of microphones holding a press conference about 45 minutes after he arrived at the hospital.<br>
Blacks have such resiliency e.g. the &#8220;mothers&#8221; of children who died in a fire talking to reporters while the fire fighters are still on the scene. Most &#8220;other&#8221; mothers would have to be sedated after such a tragedy.</p>

		<p>Who wants to bet that something is going to end badly for one or both of these people? I wonder if Rodney will pass away in a couple of years and this woman can win the &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; by writing a book, and/or selling the movie rights. </p>
<p>From the picture, Rodney looks like he is close to 60, not 44. I guess the alcohol, angel dust and the cocktail of other drugs have a tendency to age people. From his past record, I&rsquo;m sure all will be wine and roses in this marriage. </p>

		<p>I give this &#8220;marriage&#8221; a few months to a year, tops. How long will old Rodney behave himself before he hits her, beats her, stabs her, impregnates her sister/daughter, picks up another transsexual hooker, gets shot in the rear end again, has another run-in with the authorities, gets back on the rock, and who knows what else? Perhaps all of the above. No one in the degenerate media, here or abroad, likes to remind us peasants that this &#8220;victim&#8221; was pursued by the police for driving like a nut at 100MPH, flying high on PCP, and endangering lives.  And he was roughed up for fighting with the exasperated cops after they tried to subdue him. Even back then, when the Reds were working daily to gin up their desired riots with glee, they always referred deferentially to this clod as &#8220;black motorist Rodney King.&#8221; And just coincidentally, somebody in those pre-cell phone days was hanging about with a video camera and the Ministry of Truth played that brief thrashing every day on continuous loop. I saw plenty of FAR worse beatings back in school, usually perpetrated by&hellip;guess who? Like the cops pulled over and beat Frederick Douglass and not a low-living creep. Alas for them, some of us have functional memories.</p>
