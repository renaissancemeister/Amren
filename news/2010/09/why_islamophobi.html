			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Marquand, Christian Science Monitor, Sept. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is Europe, not the United States, where the West and Islam exist in closest daily proximity. Some 20 million to 30 million Muslims live here, making up about 4 percent of the population compared with less than 1 percent in America. Mosques, once an urban phenomenon, are found in far corners of the Continent. Muslims are more visible on European streets, and most are not professionals, but work in retail, agriculture, food service, and labor.</p>
<p>In the US, the controversy over the proposed Islamic center near ground zero has brought some of the most visible instances of public Islam-bashing, mostly on the right side of the political spectrum  &mdash;  a departure from the line taken by President Bush after 9/11 not to equate Islam with terrorism.</p>
<p>But in Europe a pushback against immigrants, many of whom are Muslim, has been under way for much longer. A postwar Europe long priding itself on cosmopolitan tolerance is facing a population seen as different  &mdash;  at a time of concern about the economy, jobs, and when mainstream Europe isn&rsquo;t quite sure about its security and its future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The past year has a brought a wide range of anti-Islamic measures. Switzerland passed a referendum to ban minarets on mosques. Belgium has prohibited the burqa, or full-length veil worn by Muslim women, and France is about to.</p>
<p>In June, voters in the Netherlands  &mdash;  whose second-largest city, Rotterdam, has a majority population of ethnic minorities  &mdash;  made the party of anti-Islam political figure Geert Wilders the third largest in Dutch politics. Mr. Wilders&rsquo;s platform calls for banning the Koran and new mosques, taxing head scarves, and ending immigration from Muslim countries. Wilders is now in negotiations to join the ruling coalition. He is also scheduled to appear on Sept. 11 alongside former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich at a ground zero commemoration in New York.</p>
<p>Such politics has engendered Muslim antipathy in parts of both the right and the left. Over the past five years, &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; has become more mainstream and more comfortably settled. Social politeness and taboos on talking about Islam are eroding at a time when Europeans aren&rsquo;t exactly sure what they think about Islam.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After 9/11, a small industry of literature, much of it produced in the US, predicted a coming &#8220;Eurabia&#8221;  &mdash;  a tsunami of Islam that will make Europe unrecognizable, where Muslim birthrates overwhelm older populations, mosques are as plentiful as McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants, and Islamic sharia law supplants European constitutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Justin Vaïsse, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, argues that actual data about Muslim birthrates in Europe (which are declining as Muslims assimilate and have smaller families) and immigration (500,000 a year) belie the dire projections of the Continent becoming Eurabia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The paradox of this genre is that it dwells on the heated controversies and tensions taking place in Europe while at the same time claiming that Europeans are in denial of their problems,&#8221; says Mr. Vaïsse, coauthor of &#8220;Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France.&#8221; &#8220;And the emphasis on the anecdotal tends to obscure the fact that, from the fight over minarets in Switzerland to the debate over head scarves in France, current tensions are part of a normal and democratic process of adjustment, not the first signs of an impending catastrophe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Often absent are views of Muslims themselves. Much of the discussion aimed at Islam takes place as if the Muslims weren&rsquo;t in the room. Scant attention is paid to vast religious and cultural differences between groups. French Muslims tend to be from Arab and African states, British Muslims from South Asia, Dutch Muslims from Morocco and Indonesia, German Muslims from Turkey.</p>
<p>Muslims, interviewed at mosques, offices, and cafes in Paris and London, say they often don&rsquo;t recognize common depictions of themselves. They resent the fact that Islam is a subject of derision and reject the stereotype of Muslims as being one uniform, slightly sinister group.</p>
<p>Tufyal Choudhury, a law lecturer at Durham University in England and the primary author of an 11-city study on Muslims in Europe, notes that Muslim concerns are not about spreading the faith, but housing, education, and neighborhood safety. Young second-generation Muslims have high expectations but often feel excluded. &#8220;Their parents had less expectations and less disappointment,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>A recent French government study found that job applicants with Arab Muslim names had less than half the chance of getting an interview than applicants with French names.</p>
<p>One Muslim, Said from Cameroon, interviewed at a Paris mosque before prayers, points out that Europe is a place of liberty for Muslims, many of whom have escaped repressive states. Some come to escape orthodox Islam while still being devout. More Muslim women find Europe a harbor to challenge older &#8220;cultural&#8221; models of Islam that restrict their freedoms. Muslims agree that some younger adherents get radicalized. But others are eager to integrate. They want to be European, or French, or Dutch. In university settings and among some Muslim moderates, frank reappraisals of the Koran are under way, which includes a tougher look at its calls for militancy.</p>

		<p>This CSM article, with its gently reassuring &#8220;don&rsquo;t worry; be happy&#8221; tone illustrates what&rsquo;s wrong with what passes for Christianity these days.  I suggest that Robert Marquand be sentenced to a few years of living in one of Paris&rsquo; Moslem ghettos.  <i>Then</i> he might understand why White Europeans are &#8220;aren&rsquo;t exactly sure what they think about Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;current tensions are part of a normal and democratic process of adjustment, not the first signs of an impending catastrophe.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Keep telling yourself that, Robert.<br>

		<p>Twice previously Islam has entered Europe through military force and twice it has been expelled. This time military force is NOT being used and perhaps Islam will NOT be expelled. But the consequences are no less dire?</p>
<p>Having different groups of people trying to live together in the same place is usually, almost always, a receipe for disaster. Where ever it is, it is not material, and what ever the differences are, there is always that element of distrust and hate!</p>
<p>And it all leads to NO GOOD!<br>

If you dislike or disapprove of something, you&rsquo;re not &#8220;phobic&#8221;. A phobia implies an irrational fear, an ILLNESS. The use of such a slanted term is a prejudicial one, skewed to malign the accused. It&rsquo;s really nothing but a cunning piece of propaganda to shame and silence the opposition. The Left is masterful at coining these propaganda terms.</p>
<p>There are irrational fears, and there are very well justified dislikes.  Opposition to Islamification and the desire to resist its suffocating embrace are not in any way irrational or &#8220;sick&#8221;. Given what we see of Islam,  they are very sensible and justified responses to an unwholesome and repressive cult.</p>
<p>Our ancestors fought for a millenium and a half to avoid conquest by Islam.  Were they all irrational and sick, suffering from a so-called &#8220;phobia&#8221;? </p>
<p>We want to preserve ourselves and our way of life. Is that wrong?  These other people are perfectly free to practice their own ways of life in their own countries. They already have many countries. Are we now to admit them into our countries and make accommodations to them, misled  by the (false) notion that we are being enlightened and tolerant?  That is the first step on the path to subjugation and dhimittude. That is the hiss of the Serpent, coaxing Eve not to be afraid but to come and take a bite.</p>

<p>The multicults have been working overtime a lot longer than over here.  That only means they will be the first to self-destruct, howsever.</p>
<p>Just think what a horrible scene it would be if the Euro economies crashed and the jihadist hordes were cut off from their freebies.</p>
<p>Hey&hellip;..wait a minute&hellip;.if I&rsquo;m not incorrect, that&rsquo;s what is happening right now, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Too bad they can&rsquo;t eliminate the entire bunch of rabid multicult idiots instead of watching their societies go up in flames.</p>

<p>Oh, so, because it may not come as quickly or to the same extent as predicted, that means that the underlying concerns and worries are groundless? </p>
<p>This Vaïsse is as much as admitting that they are not. Otherwise, he would say, &#8220;Why shouldn&rsquo;t Europe be overwhelmed by Islam? It&rsquo;ll be good for all of us! Multiculturalism and diversity and all that!&#8221; </p>
<p>No, he doesn&rsquo;t dare argue that, and so he&rsquo;s by default admitting that the pamphleteers are right in their concerns about cultural and ethnic displacement.</p>

		<p>Typical propaganda piece by one of our &#8220;conservative&#8221; newspapers.  No need to worry about Muslims, most are just a tad darker and go to the mosque instead of the church.  Don&rsquo;t listen to that propaganda about Tours and Vienna.</p>
<p>Journalists are taught to close out a piece with the point they are trying to make, and in this case we learn &#8220;frank reappraisals of the Koran are under way.&#8221;  Ha-ha-ha!            </p>

		<p>an estimated 30 million Muslims, birth rates tiple that of Europeans, and 500,000 arriving annually??</p>
<p>what does that means in 10 years??</p>
<p>twenty??</p>
<p>thirty??</p>
<p>If only journalists could do arithmetic&hellip;.</p>
<p>Even if Muslim immigration is cut off permanently tomorrow, their birth rates insure that they will be a large proportion of Eurpe&rsquo;s population in 10-20 years.</p>
<p>Europeans are worried about being DISPLACED by a people that OPENLY despises everything they stand for.</p>
<p>If not for the Stalinist censorship that blankets the continent, with jail terms for simply questioning the wisdom of Muslim immigration, and a Thought Police more concerned about repressing Europeans&rsquo; free speech than about exploding Muslim crime rates, we would be hearing loud and clear:</p>
<p>NO!!!! to govenement-subsidized imams preaching teror, no to hoodlums ruining Europe&rsquo;s cities, no to the invasion, no to the Europeans worker SUBSIDIZING HIS OWN DISPOSSESSION.</p>

<p>100 per cent correct GHW.<br>
The same gaggle of insidious fools (the left) invented the terms, &#8216;homophobia&rsquo; and &#8216;racism&rsquo; and for reasons that will always confound me, the majority are running scared! I&rsquo;ve even heard the term &#8216;transphobia&rsquo;! I didn&rsquo;t make that up!<br>
Have you noticed that &#8216;climate change deniers&rsquo; are also tarred with the same brush? Verging on metal illness for calling the party line into question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be very curious for the author of the article to give us a few names here : precisely what &#8220;Muslim moderates&#8221; in Europe and which European universities are proceeding to &#8220;frankly reappraise the Koran&#8221; ?</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this is all wishful thinking. All right, I know of <i>one</i> French Muslim who has said publicly that he wanted some parts of the Koran to be changed or cancelled. </p>
<p>His name is Pascal Hilout, he is of French origin and has converted to Islam. He is an activist within Rispote Laïque, which is vilified as &#8220;Islamophobic&#8221;, &#8220;fascist&#8221; and &#8220;racist&#8221; by a great many French Muslims, including some officially &#8220;moderate&#8221; ones such as the journalist Mohamed Sifoui.</p>
<p>I cannot name one French Muslim of Muslim origin who has called for a reappraisal of the Koran.</p>

<p>What percentage of &#8220;European&#8221; Muslims are unemployed and living on welfare?  And how do Muslim crime rates compare with native crime rates?  Did Mr. Marquand think it best to ignore these questions, because the answers might have undercut the point he was trying to make?  </p>

		<p>Quite true that having a phobia suggests a mental illness. It implies that your dislike is irrational and pathological, rather than justified or reasonable.  It is connected with unreasoning emotion rather than good sense and logic. It suggests that you need mental treatment, and that nobody should take you seriously.</p>
<p>Coining propaganda words like xenophobia is a masterful coup of the left.</p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;d say it has to more do with their historical experience with religious wars and persecutions of the past, especially the two World Wars of the 20th century. These have raised tolerance of all to the level of some kind of a religious virtue (or at least a civic virtue)&hellip; and made it a fundamental dogma of modern life that is not to be questioned. </p>
<p>Above all is their fear of association with anything that seems faintly &#8220;nazi&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t think it has any connection with rejecting their Christian heritage.</p>
