<h1>Monica Conyers to Begin 3-Year Prison Term Today at W.Va. Camp Cupcake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press, September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But come 2 o&rsquo;clock today, Monica Conyers&rsquo; fight to stay out of prison should be officially over when she begins her 37-month prison sentence at the Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia.</p>
<p>The facility, nicknamed Camp Cupcake, is nestled among the bucolic foothills of the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia along the Greenbrier River. It looks like a college campus  &mdash;  and is called that by locals  &mdash;  and has housed celebrity convicts such as Martha Stewart.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conyers pleaded guilty in 2009 to taking bribes to vote for Synagro Technologies&rsquo; $1.2-billion sludge disposal deal.</p>
<p>Her last-ditch effort to stay out of prison was shot down Thursday when a federal appellate court denied her request to remain free on bond until it considers her appeal.</p>
<p>Conyers is trying to withdraw her guilty plea. A federal judge has already refused her request. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At sentencing March 10, she tried to withdraw her guilty plea, saying: &#8220;I just don&rsquo;t feel that I should go to jail for something that I didn&rsquo;t do.&#8221;<br>

		<p>For those of you who never had an opportunity to watch her on television during a Detroit City Council meeting I can tell you her behavior was arrogant and outrageous beyond belief.  She would actually refuse to shut up when speaking out of order and attacking the Chair or anyone else.  Meetings had to be adjourned because they just couldn&rsquo;t conduct any business.  And all the time she was acting self righteous and indignant because she wasn&rsquo;t in absolute control.  What a truly stupid obnoxious person.  Got a lot less time than she deserved.  If Congressman John Conners wasn&rsquo;t her husband I am sure she would have got a more deserving sentence.</p>

		<p>One thing is true..Ms Conyers really and truly doesnt <br>
believe she did anything wrong. She could in fact pass<br>
a lie detector test. She could be forced to listen to <br>
audio tapes with her voice accepting the bribes, and<br>
say&hellip;&#8221;thats not my voice&#8221;. She could be shown video tapes<br>
of  her taking cash bribes and counting it bill by bill..<br>
and say &#8220;thats not me&#8221;. Such is the absolute lack of conscious<br>
thought in most blacks. First comes the &#8220;emotional need&#8221;..ie<br>
&#8220;I am a victim&#8221;..this is so strong that no facts stand in the way,<br>
no proof means anything. The emotional need must be fufilled and <br>
fact, proof, evidence, reality itself cannot stand in the way.</p>

		<p>Federal prisoners are classified according to their escape risk and threat to staff and other inmates.  I&rsquo;m sure Conyers scored pretty low on these items.  She will do the same kind of time that many former politicians, cops, and attorneys do.  </p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll start out in the laundry or kitchen and then move up to a better job, maybe tutoring inmates in reading or shelving books in the library.</p>
<p>If she escapes and is caught, or attacks someone, then she will be moved to a prison with high fences and closer supervision.  I&rsquo;m glad she got some time but I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with where she is doing it.</p>

<p>There is no hope for whites in &#8220;our country&#8221;, we have been set aside by AA and EEoc.</p>
<p>The objective of the ruling elite is to obliterate the middle class through debt and regressive value systems, and to offer major solutions, all of which rob of us of freedoms.</p>

		<p>(Shrug)  I did a 36 months on 41 for something I said, so I think 37 for a bribe-taking public official is light.  Out of 37 months, Conyers will serve a hair over 32.5, with maximum time off for good behavior.  In all fairness, the two-point lowering of her sentence on the Federal Sentencing Guidelines sentence table should be revoked, because in spite of a guilty plea, she clearly is not taking any real responsibility for her criminal behavior.<br>

		<p>Does anyone really think she will spend 37 months in prison?  She will be pardoned because Obama needs John Conyers&rsquo; support.  Of course, the pardon will be done quietly and after the Nov. election.</p>

		<p>Short of a Presidential pardon or a successful appeal of her sentence, it is legally impossible for Conyers to serve less than 32.5 months out of the 37.  Up to four months of the 32.5 can be at a halfway house, but those places aren&rsquo;t much fun, either (the staff knows that the residents are almost home and don&rsquo;t want to go back to prison, so they cheerfully bully them).  Conyers can not appeal the conviction itself, since a guilty plea waves the right to do that.  I unfortunately have quite a lot of first-hand knowledge as to the workings of federal sentencing law and BOP rules: the maximum time off for good behavior is one day for each seven actually served, and up to 10% of one&rsquo;s sentence (maximum of six months but at least one month) will be at a halfway house.</p>
<p>She probably has three years of supervised release.  This is not parole, because parole was abolished in the federal prison system in about 1986, so only inmates - like Leonard Peltier - who were sentenced before then (under the old law) get parole hearings.  It&rsquo;s basically supervised probation.  One fills out a monthly report listing income and expenses, describes the vehicles one owns/drives, submits to random drug and alcohol tests and provides proof of employment or proof of attempts to obtain employment. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think POTUS will pardon Conyers before 2012, and that&rsquo;s only if Obama loses the election - he will be in office for two months after the election, so an avalanche of pardons can safely be expected then.  The blowback from an early pardon would make Obama in particular and the democrats in general stink out loud, and they&rsquo;re already facing serious trouble in November.  They&rsquo;re political ding-dongs, but they aren&rsquo;t total idiots, so don&rsquo;t expect an early pardon for Conyers.</p>
