			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Budapest Times, September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8216;Politically correct public discourse in Hungary has for decades prevented the solution of problems&rsquo;</p>
<p>The far-right party Jobbik has called for legislation that would make the denial of &#8220;inherent criminality&#8221; among the country&rsquo;s Roma minority punishable by up to three years in jail, five for politicians and other public figures.</p>
<p>The draft proposal for an amendment to the Criminal Code was submitted to parliament last Monday. One of its three sponsors, Jobbik politician János Volner, told reporters last Wednesday that the aim was to ensure there is &#8220;honest debate&#8221; about certain issues, &#8220;for example about the question of Gypsy criminality, as is currently taking place in France and Italy&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Sociological relationship&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The proposed amendment to criminalise &#8220;the denial of facts that are common knowledge&#8221; does not mention Roma or Gypsies explicitly: &#8220;Whoever should in front of the wider public deny, cast doubt on, or paint as insignificant any sociological relationship that is relevant to criminal law and is common knowledge  &mdash;  especially with relation to public safety, a type of crime, or characteristic criminal groups  &mdash;  is guilty of a criminal offence and punishable by three years&rsquo; imprisonment.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is in the &#8220;justification&#8221; section of the document that the Roma are name-checked: &#8220;The so-called politically correct public discourse in Hungary has for decades prevented the solution of problems, which are well known among the public but not recognised at the state level, such as Gypsy criminality, and investigation and research into causes.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Other anti-Roma initiatives</b></p>
<p>Jobbik won 17 per cent of the vote in April general elections, following a campaign with promises to stamp out &#8220;Gypsy crime&#8221; through initiatives such as setting up local gendarmeries.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s support was strongest in the poor rural northeast, where the proportion of Roma is in many places far higher than the national average of around seven per cent.</p>
<p>Jobbik spokeswoman Dóra Duró acknowledged in an interview in March  &mdash;  which can still be read on Jobbik&rsquo;s website  &mdash;  that one of the reasons the far-right party enjoyed little support in Budapest&rsquo;s District XI was that there was &#8220;no significant Gypsy crime&#8221; in the area.</p>
<p>Jobbik&rsquo;s mayoral candidate for the eastern city of Miskolc, Márton Szegedi, called last month for ethnic Roma repeat offenders to be isolated in internment camps and stripped of their Hungarian citizenship. Local government elections will be held on 3 October.<br/>

		<p>I have been following Jobbik and have been reasonably impressed.  This, however, makes me quite happy.  One should not be allowed to lie and thus cause damage to ones&rsquo; own people without suffering the consequences.  Reverse-political correctness, I love it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander.&#8221; - ancient maxim</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m not a fan of putting limits on earnest and intellectual discourse, at the same time it&rsquo;s hard to feel sorry for leftists who will suffer if this bill becomes law.  After all, they&rsquo;ve only been doing things like this for decades in Europe, North America &amp; Australia.</p>
<p>As it stands in this case, denial of the inherent criminality in Gypsies is like denying the validity of Darwinism: ridiculous.  The danger is this law is so vaguely worded it is easily subject to abuse.</p>

		<p>I can see the appeal of this particular law.  Perhaps we can get something like this going here in the States regarding black and Hispanic crime.  No, I don&rsquo;t actually support any restrictions on free speech.  But we have suffered from infringements from the left so long, it is refreshing to see this suggested.</p>

		<p>I would agree with poster #3.  This law is too vague and too draconian.  And it could be abused by future regimes, in ways that have not been anticipated.</p>
<p>But a law clarifying that denial of realities (realities commonly acknowledged and clearly verifiable by objective standards) in a way which endangers public welfare (by impeding definition and thus resolution of statistically significant problems) constitutes Abrogation of Duty, would possibly achieve the goals that have been expressed here.</p>

		<p>Not good, </p>
<p>Our movements should be built upon freedom of speech, always.  In many countries we are ourselves denied this and we must not go down that road if ever in power.</p>
<p>Our arguments can win out, every time, on their own merits&hellip;. this kind of thing is just ammunition for the other side who love calling us Nazis given any excuse.</p>
<p>Curtailment of free speech on opinions, ANY opinions is authoritarian at best and fascist at worst.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need it because as Jared Taylor says, we are right.</p>

		<p>Slander is illegal here, and much politically correct rhetoric is slanderous. Saying that whites are responsible for the antisocial behavior of blacks, for instance, is a dangerous lie that could easily come at someone&rsquo;s expense. This law is just building upon established codes of conduct.</p>
<p>That being said, I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about it. This kind of legislation could be easily abused by Marxists.</p>

		<p>Have Gypsies spent one second in  the past 2,000 years wondering why they are so unpopular?  I know they don&rsquo;t care, but every so often they are massacred or driven off by force. Most European and American Jews for example make some effort to assimilate or conform to white majority customs and values. What is it with the Gypsies?</p>

		<p>Yes, it should be a criminal offence to lie to the electorate whether knowingly or unknowingly. </p>
<p>After all, the onus should be on officials <b>and</b> journalists most particularly, to first examine the evidence of a case and check their facts accurately before pronouncing publically on a given subject. </p>
<p>It should also be decreed a criminal offence to compose and propagate hateful propaganda against indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>It should also be decreed a criminal offence to attempt the dispossession, desinfranchisement, usurpation and racial and cultural destruction of native peoples by the imposition of  mass importation of alien peoples and the additional elevation of them, their origins and their cultures over those of the indigenous.</p>
<p>It should also be degreed a criminal offences to support,conspire with and facilitate open border, mass alien immigration, Affirmative Action, anti-White racial discrimination and enforced multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the above would hopefully represent merely a handful of measures that would constitute the beginning of an all-out clampdown on those who can be considered as belonging to the Far Left and other Communist offshoot organisations along with those of alien ethnicities and belief systems as well.</p>

<p>I agree. I think most of us know by now that laws such as these would be used against WHITES even more!  We are already demonized for all the world&rsquo;s woes and blamed for ALL oppression of any nonwhite, so this is nothing but smoke and mirrors to make us &#8220;think&#8221; we will now have a voice. Sure we will, when we are 6 feet under.</p>

		<p>Philosophically, I would love to hold the high ground and denounce this up and down. But given the political climate in Europe, and the penchant on the part of some for laws criminalizing thought, why not fight fire with fire? Perhaps then some groups will be forced to re-examine their insane, selfish ideas and how they effect the lives of real people.  </p>

<p>Easily fixed, by moving the Gypsies into District XI.  They won&rsquo;t object, because they&rsquo;re good lefties.  The Gypsies won&rsquo;t object, because the Hungarians are good lefties.  Everybody wins!</p>

		<p>All well and good (denial of &#8216;communally known and objectively verifiable&rsquo; problems as a criminal offense by those in a fiduciary position to monitor and act in the publics&rsquo; best interests&hellip;).</p>
<p>The problem then shifts however to the mutability of interpretation or outright suppression of the statistics themselves.  What we face here is a moral problem where the threat are acting like small children.  If they know that X avenue is cut off to them by threat of punishment, they will avoid acting in Y good conscience by using Z methods to change the definition of what is good or conscience.</p>
<p>Such negative legislation is always open to corruption by those who are themselves already corrupt.  The only thing you can do is remove those corrupted.</p>
<p>While I am not opposed to criminal consequences to certain acts, I would much rather have it be on a positive basis:</p>
<p>You WILL honestly report the degree of criminality in X/Y/Z racial groups on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>You WILL honestly, and fully, televise opposed opinions, without suppression or intimidation or biased ridicule, helping them gather and present supporting evidence on A/B/C subjects (the reality of immigration, who it really benefits and what the economic consequences to the rest of us are).</p>
<p>Finally, you _will_ begin to broach open and honest information from real experts in the field about the nature of expressed behaviors as genotypically derived from evolutionary traits.  Race is not skin deep.</p>
<p>If there are quotas of honest reporting of both sides of the story, I think we can begin to win the &#8220;Sorry for the ugliness of the truth but do you now -want- to deny the facts while their consequences crash like a tidal wave, over you?&#8221; wars among and between racial groups.</p>
<p>I want equal time for the same subject.  Not another form of suppression for those who disagree with me.</p>
<p>After all, if nobody is allowed to debate -anything- then the very process of reaching those &#8216;communally well known and acknowledged&rsquo; viewpoints is interrupted in terms of defining the performance of those we put above us to mind the store.</p>
<p>If we could get something like this, the only thing left would be to make damn sure &#8216;our expert&rsquo; was not himself either a mole or somehow turned to act in willfully stupid or ignorant fashion.  Jared Taylor, Steve Sailer and Paul Brimelow are emminent examples of the kinds of persons who, with their pedigrees, if allowed to speak openly, in half hour segments, with all their backing knowledge, could really make a difference to this nation&rsquo;s understanding of a lot of previously buried subjects.</p>
