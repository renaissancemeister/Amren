<h1><a href="http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2010/09/the_case_of_the_racist_doll_pr.php">The Case of the Racist Doll Pricing at a North Miami Target</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gus Garcia-Roberts, Miami New Times, September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A disturbing scene unfolded while Riptide was waiting on line at Target on Wednesday night. A woman later identified as Ketrina Brown came to the cashier with two boxed dolls: <i>Baby Alive,</i> the creepily animatronic doll that &#8220;digests&#8221;. They were exactly the same dolls, except one was black and the other one was white.</p>
<p>They were both priced on clearance, on sale from $44.99. But the white doll cost $22.48, and the black doll cost $31.48.</p>
<p>Brown was none too happy about this. &#8220;Let me ask you something,&#8221; she said loudly after having the cashier check the price. &#8220;Why are these two dolls, that do exactly the same things and the only difference between them is a paint job, priced ten dollars differently?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a bad question. We already know <i>Baby Alive</i> eats, burps, urinates, and sometimes poops. But is <i>Baby</i> also subtly racist? That seems a bit too life-like.</p>
<p>That Target&rsquo;s &#8220;Leader on Duty&#8221;, who, citing corporate policy, gave her name only as Elise, {snip} said that the prices are set by corporate headquarters, and speculated that the white doll was cheaper because it was discontinued by Hasbro.</p>
<p>She even offered, speaking to Brown, who is African-American, that &#8220;most people are happy to hear that their doll isn&rsquo;t being discontinued.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones just grew more and more disconsolate. &#8220;When is this sort of thing going to stop, man?&#8221; she asked Riptide, who had identified ourselves as the press. &#8220;I feel sick right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So we called headquarters, and eventually received an e-mail with a statement from Target spokersperson Tara Schlosser. {snip}<blockquote>At Target, we are dedicated to offering exceptional prices on items throughout our stores. While we can&rsquo;t go into great detail on Target&rsquo;s pricing strategies, items are put on clearance based on their popularity and sales. The price of individual items is not at the discretion of our Store Team Leaders.<br>
</blockquote>Wait, did they really try to turn a racist-doll-price story into an ad for &#8220;exceptional prices&#8221;? Are they <em>trying</em> to lose to Wal-Mart?<br>

		<p>Meanwhile whites are probably killed in the parking lot of Target. But don&rsquo;t worry, we will learn it wasn&rsquo;t racist. White friends and family members will insist their dead friend wasn&rsquo;t racist in court. </p>

<p>My sentiments exactly.  When <i>is</i> this childishness going to stop?  I&rsquo;m feeling pretty sick myself.</p>
<p>If it had been the black doll that cost less, they&rsquo;d be whining that it shows how undervalued blacks are.  It would be an insult to their Black Pride; yet another manifestation of Institutional Racism.</p>
<p>This infantile blubbering continues only for one reason: because Whites <i>always</i> give in to it.<br>

		<p>This is a situation you cannot win, unless you keep the shelves stocked with the exact same number of black and white dolls, and price them EXACTLY the same, regardless of which sells and which does not. If the white dolls cost more, it is &#8220;de-valuing&#8221; the non-white dolls, If the white dolls cost less, it is taking advantage of the non-white parents who would (supposedly) buy the dolls for their children. <br>
I have an idea, quit making non-white dolls altogether, after all, with our &#8220;oppressive legacy of slavery&#8221; the selling of a non-white doll might remind the child playing with it of the sale of their purported ancestors, and cause them some psychic pain&hellip;.</p>

		<p>So since the white doll was cheaper blacks are whining that they have to pay more for black dolls.</p>
<p>Had the white dolls been more expensive blacks would grouse that the store did not value black children as much as whites.</p>
<p>Either way they pose as victims.</p>

		<p>Among the biggest mysteries in this ridiculous story is the customer&rsquo;s lack of economic understanding of what a price signals. </p>
<p>A price is a piece of information used to communicate a perceived VALUE as determined by the market. Therefore, item X priced at $1 is more highly valued than product Y priced at $0.50. </p>
<p>This economic concept, as applied to the story, reveals that the black doll&rsquo;s price is an indication that it is more highly valued by consumers, who are willing to pay a premium to possess it, while the white doll&rsquo;s lack of success as a consumer commodity is evident in its substantially reduced price, which acts as an inducement for customers to buy up the store&rsquo;s remaining, unpopular stock of the item. </p>
<p>So she is angry because a black doll is a more highly valued commodity than a white doll?</p>
<p>Furthermore, both dolls were reduced from their original prices, thus indicating that neither were great sellers. Does the sale reduction in pricing of both dolls, in and of itself, mean that Target is racist toward both whites and blacks, albeit allegedly slightly moreso toward blacks?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Would it not be just as likely that this ignorant woman, who seems to be an archetype of a class of perpetually aggrieved citizens, would be outraged if the black doll were, say, substantially less expensive than the white doll, indicting that the white doll was &#8220;more valuable&#8221; and subjectively &#8220;better&#8221;?</p>
<p>In the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; America of 2010, you just can&rsquo;t win.</p>

		<p>Huh?  Wouldn&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d be HAPPY that the black doll is priced higher, since that would suggest it&rsquo;s valued more highly by prospective purchasers?  Or is that kind of basic economic thinking beyond her abilities?</p>

		<p>Ketrina Brown might want to shop around  &mdash;  a few years ago, a local store was offering various &#8220;ethnic&#8221; Barbie dolls at a steep (and I mean to-the-bone) discount  &mdash;  the more &#8220;ethnic&#8221; (or &#8220;exotic&#8221;) they were, the bigger the discount. I considered getting my daughter one (or two, or three  &mdash;  you could easily get a whole troop of darker Barbies for the price of one white one), but when she was in the store with me, she showed zero interest in them. The law of supply-and-demand at work, or is that racist too? </p>

		<p>This could have been avoided by placing the White and Black dolls in different sections of the store or some place where they aren&rsquo;t side by side for some overly sensitive person to compare them.  Perhaps put the Black dolls up at the register and the White dolls on a discount table in the toy department.</p>

		<p>I guess the half-white half-Hispanic Comrade Gus doesn&rsquo;t understand that the black doll and white doll simply didn&rsquo;t sell as well as one another, and so there was a pricing disparity. The fact that the white doll was discounted means that it sold worse than the black one, right? not the other way around? So she shouldn&rsquo;t be offended at all, she should have assumed that Target valued the black doll more than the white one, and showed it by changing ten dollars more.</p>

		<p>I can think of no more perfect illustration as to how one can NEVER satisfy blacks.<br>
One store discounts the black doll lower than white doll - that&rsquo;s raciss.  A different store discounts the WHITE doll lower than the black doll - THAT&rsquo;S ALSO raciss.</p>
<p>How about we make NO black dolls.  And tell blacks we are sick of their games.</p>

		<p>Really? Seriously? Fact is, if the pricing was in reverse and the White doll cost more, blacks would say that the black doll was undervalued and that the pricing was once again, racist. More and more black is just a euphemism for idiot.</p>

		<p>Only last May Walmart was criticism because the black Barbie dolls were selling for less than the white barbies.  Seems the black dolls had less market appeal and were being discounted to move inventory.  This was interpreted by some to indicate that Blacks were worth less than whites.  Now in the most recent Target case the Black doll is worth MORE than the white.  And that is offensive.  There is no winning.  </p>

		<p>All it means is, blacks are stupid enough to pay $31.48, and whites are stupid enough to pay $22.48 for a doll. The stores only charge what they can get for a product. Just as in housing, there will always be suckers willing to pay double and triple the value of the product. </p>

		<p>I recall another case like this, several months ago.<br>
This type of fuss, racial at that, is not worth it to the store.  They should have a strict  policy of equal pricing for the same type of doll, when the only difference is race. It&rsquo;s just a lot easier on the store in the long run.  Even if they lose some money, they come out ahead by avoiding a racial scene or lawsuit or bad publicity.</p>

		<p>Price the black dolls cheaper then the White ones and you are &#8220;demeaning&#8221; and &#8220;insulting&#8221; blacks. Price them higher then the White ones and you are &#8220;ripping off&#8221; blacks. As I have always said, when you are dealing with blacks, you just can&rsquo;t win.</p>

		<p>This incident graphically shows how for large numbers of blacks, race is the alpha and omega - the totality - of their existence, and how society humours and even encourages this.  If anyone else had said in effect &#8220;I am going to politicize clearance sale items at big box stores&#8221;, they would be ridiculed as a crackpot.  Instead, this obsessed lunatic is taken seriously - because she&rsquo;s black.</p>
