<h1>Mexico Marks Anniversary of 1847 Battle With US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seattle Post Intelligencer, September 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Felipe Calderon on Monday criticized both Americans and Mexicans for their roles in the 1846-1848 war that cost Mexico half its territory during a ceremony commemorating the definitive battle of the conflict.</p>
<p>Speaking on the 163rd anniversary of the Battle of Chapultepec, Calderon called the war an &#8220;unjust military aggression motivated by clearly imperialistic interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexico lost about half its territory to the United States in the war, including much of what later became Arizona, Nevada, Utah and California.</p>
<p>But Calderon also said Mexicans deserved some blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost because of the invasion and expansionist desires of our enemy, but also because of divisions among Mexicans,&#8221; the president said, noting a widely cited theory that Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna refused to send reinforcements to another general because of bad blood between the two, contributing to a key U.S. victory that allowed the invading troops to advance to Chapultepec.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We only prosper when we are united,&#8221; Calderon told the crowd as Mexico prepares to celebrate the bicentennial of its 1810 independence Wednesday and Thursday. &#8220;That is the great lesson of our history.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Note the biased set up of the story.  Mexico &#8220;lost&#8221; half of &#8220;its territory.  Its claims to that territory were derivative of Spanish imperial claims, and they tried to claim the territory be default as the Spanish empire receded.  It barely held onto the territory, and could not handle the Indian tribes there.  Accordingly, its claims are bogus.  The U.S. had to fight for its claims to the Northwest Territory and to the Louisiana Purchase in the War of 1812, and did so.  In the competition for territory lost to European empires, the Mexicans could not enforce their claims.  Tough!  I hate that the media uncritically accepts the Mexican lies.</p>

		<p>Give me a break.  Calderon presently cannot even govern his own country.  Let&rsquo;s not talk about the past.  Mexico is a third country and has always been.  Talk is cheap.  Mexico dumps the population that it does not want onto this country.  Actually, back then, Mexico asked if we wanted more land at a certain price.  This country said no.  Every modern invention enjoyed by Mexicans, not a single one was invented by a Mexican.  So there.</p>

		<p>Common sense news flash: Calderon, and his predecessor, Vicente Fox, are ostensibly White men.</p>
<p>They play the &#8220;Brown Card&#8221; to appease the ignorant peasants that they don&rsquo;t dump into the United States.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen a picture of Vicente Fox, the last Mexican president, picture a 6&rsquo; 4&#8221; White man towering over the 5&rsquo; tall mestizos, telling them about the various injustices committed by &#8220;them&#8221; (the White man!) against &#8220;us&#8221; (the brown masses!).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real riot.  Vicente &#8220;Fox&#8221; changed his name from FUCHS  &mdash;   he&rsquo;s German and Scottish, mostly.</p>
<p>White traitors, trying to throw up smoke and mirrors to avoid the truth that like the rest of South America, Mexico is ruled (on very shaky grounds!) by a White elite.  Surprise, surprise.</p>

<p>Various Mexican Politicians have already noted that Mexicans remain Mexican, wherever they go, including when they immigrate into the USA.  </p>
<p>Does this mean that the 30-million Mexican that are currently living in the USA remain &#8220;united&#8221; with Mexico?  Is Calderon correct?  Is it good for the USA to have large numbers of foreigners living here who are &#8220;united with Mexico,&#8221; and who think that California and Arizona belong to Mexico?  </p>

		<p>There is a little revisionist history going on here.  The real cause of the war was a confrontation over the US annexation of Texas.  Fact is the US had nothing to do with the Texas break away from Mexico.  Texas was an independent country recognized by us and all the major European powers and  it had an absolute right to join the US. Mexico&rsquo;s refusal to recognize reality was about as stupid as if the British had refused to recognize the US 10 years after our independence.  By sending Mexican troops into sovereign US territory after the annexation and directly attacking US troops in brought the war and its consequences on its own head. </p>

		<p>This chronic complaining of how Mexico &#8220;lost its territory&#8221; is not only getting tiring, it&rsquo;s patently false.  Neither the Spaniards, who actually claimed these lands for Spain, but ceded them to Mexico in the early 19th century, nor especially Mexicans, ever settled or colonized these lands. There were a few old forts and missions in California, and what would become (lower) New Mexico, but virtually no people of Spanish blood, and almost certainly no &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; there.  The lands were not settled, farmed and developed until done so by the white, Anglo-Saxon pioneers who trekked westward under very difficult conditions from the early 1820s until the 1880s.  As a matter of fact, due to the Comanche menace (and it was an horrific menace), little settlement was done beyond what is now mid-Texas.  It was first, the Texas rangers, and then the U.S. Army, along with the settlers, that pacified these areas and created Arizona, Nevada, Utah and California.  Mexico WANTED and ASKED the U.S. to make the Gadsen purchase to create a buffer to protect it against the Comanche, who constantly raided into Mexico during the winters.  Look it up.  This is all historical fact.  The Mexican politicians need a scapegoat to distract their populace from their failures.</p>

<p>Mexico didn&rsquo;t lose anything. Both nations agreed on a truce and then both sat down and agreed on where the border would be. Mexico sold the USA this territory which at the time was a mostly unpopulated desert wasteland. The USA paid a huge sum for it and Mexico was getting good money and dumping their wasteland. Mexico didn&rsquo;t care until gringos moved in later and made a success of it. Then suddenly, they started screaming about their land. What they don&rsquo;t understand it land means nothing, it&rsquo;s the people that make the land.</p>

		<p>Ever since that battle back in 1847, Mexico has been our number one enemy. Not Russia, not China, not even Nazi Germany or Japan, even though all have murdered or killed Americans in battle. Mexico has been working to attack us covertly, from within and with wave after wave of their locust like invaders all this time. Back in World War One, they conspired with Germany against the United States, but our intelligence intercepted communications between the two countries and Washington put a stop to it. Mexico has likely killed and injured more Americans through it&rsquo;s gangs, drug cartels, and illegal alien law breakers than those who died fighting in wars abroad.</p>

<p>This is NOT how a good neighbor talks about a neighbor. A demarche or whatever they call it needs to be filed with the Mexican Ambassador.</p>
<p>NOW, I do not agree that this was unjust military aggression. But let us suppose that it was, 100 %. Well, GOOD. Those places that became American territory are so much the better off because of it. Does anyone disagree with that? I think not.</p>

		<p>They lost because they were out-brained and out-gunned.  Then, just as now, they were a disfunctional nation.  Had they maintained control of the territory we aquired from them, the death toll down there today would likely be even greater than it is.

		<p>The war of 1847 was the result of mexican aggression. The USA and the rest of the world considered the Rio Grande the border while the mexicans considered a river farther north to be the border. The first two battles were fought north of the Rio Grande River.<br>
   We did not take land from Mexico. We bought the land that mexico considered worthless and most of the area was controlled by the Commanches. They thought they were giving us a lemon. The USA developed this land though hard work. We paid for this land (we did not have) so that they use the money to pay the debts they owe to other nations. I don&rsquo;t know what they did with the money. In twelve years, the French had to come to get Mexico to pay up.<br>
   Why is Calderon in such a lather over this? He got a chance tostand in front of our congress and dictate to us the laws he wants us to pass. These thir world types are never happy.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true that divisions can cause a people or nation to lose key battles. Because legal citizens, particularly white Americans,are divided on immigration, the nation built in 1776 in morphing into a Third World Basket case with a debt load only a Goldman Sachs banker could love. Mexico may yet get its lost territory back, although after it sucks up immediate cash and mineral assets, it will do as good as providing jobs for its citizens squatting in California and Texas as it does for its current citizens who live in Mexico&rsquo;s currrent boundaries. Ironically, a middle class Mexico might arise if Mexico shed some of its drug run states and Indian-populated states, focused on where its whiter and more prosperous populace live. dnariecuritheodrsuckugh b a</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Mexico was in a constant state of civil war, revolution and dysfunction upon achieving independence from Spain. To wit, several Mexican states rose against Santa Anna&rsquo;s centralist govt in the same time period as that of the successful Texas Revolution. Wealthy, semi-autonomous Zacatecas, with its own well-equipped militia, as well as Yucatan and another state ( I believe Cohuila? ) rebelled as well, but Santa Anna&rsquo;s army managed to crush them all. If they had prevailed Mexico would likely have fragmented into several states. Texas rebelled in part because Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution, to which Texians had sworn allegiance. Brave but corrupt, brutal and venal, Santa Anna served as El Presidente something like 14 times.  Also, Mexico later sold the U.S. hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory in the Gadsden Purchase, when Fillmore was president, when our nations were at peace. In 1846, when war loomed, the Mexican army was larger and more battle-experienced than the U.S. regular army and Santa Anna boasted that he would march to Washington. But American regulars/volunteers possessed greater initiative, better artillery, better generals, and an innate dogged stubborness that allowed them to not know when they were beaten. <br>
   Also, Latin American nations have ripped territory from one another for centuries in scores of carnage-laden slaughters. Study the War of the Pacific, the War of the Triple Alliance, the suicidal (for Paraguay) Paraguayan War, or the vicious and futile Chaco War, all in South America. The U.S  wasn&rsquo;t responsible for a one of those. </p>

		<p>One would think that the so-called leadership of Mexico and most of Latin America would display just a small hint of embarrassment between the disparity in wealth, peronal freedom, technological, and medical advancement between North America and the mainly squalid and backward condition of their own nations.  Instead they rail and carry on about us as though the wealth we&rsquo;ve created somehow was stolen from them.</p>

		<p>The rules on this planet have been very simple for centuries; you keep the land you can defend.  Only in modern times does this seem to be a fluid concept in the minds of some.  But I fully agree that the Mexicans lost a lot of territory because they didn&rsquo;t pull together after independence and remained feudal for the most part.  The feudal nature of white Americans is the very reason we are so easily invaded by the whole of Latin America.  Until we as a race and ethnicity pull together for the common good of white Americans, we will continue to fall from leadership to mediocrity.  America fools us all because there are so many white people.  We fail to realize as a planet we white people are a fading minority.  If we want to preserve our ethnic heritage, we have to draw a line in the sand and stand united.  <br>

Mexico hates the U.S. because America&rsquo;s history is one of<br>
freedom, democracy, political stability, and incredible prosperity.<br>
America is the greatest success story of any nation EVER.<br>
Their history is one of bloody anarchy, dictatorship, endless corruption, and grinding poverty.<br>
Mexican&rsquo;s just do not have the guts to take responsibility for<br>
the failure of their history.<br>
In 1808, Charles IV of Spain abdicated the throne to his son Ferdinand VII.<br>
Ferdinand VII was so pro-British and anti-Fench that Napolean invaded Spain and replaced him with his older brother Joseph Bonaparte as king.<br>
The incident lead Spain to rebel causing a breakdown in the Spanish government which subsequently lead New Spain (Mexico) to rebel against their colonial rulers in Europe.<br>
When King Ferdinand VII regained his throne in 1814, he needed money to suppress the Rebellion in New Spain.<br>
In 1819, under President James Monroe&rsquo;s instructions, <br>
Secretary of State John Quincy Adams concluded a deal with Ferdinands Foreign Minister Luis De Onis called the Adams-Onis Treaty.<br>
The US paid Spain $5 million for 70,000 square miles of Spanish Florida and Spain recognized the validity of the Louisiana purchase, thus selling the U.S.-New spain border.<br>
Ferdinand now had the capability to suppress the New Spain rebellion but the General in charge, Augustine De Iturbide, decided to rule New Spain for himself.<br>
In 1821 he made a deal with the rebels, who put him in charge of their rebellion, leading Ferdinand to capitulate, signing the<br>
Treaty of Cordoba on August 24.<br>
But Mexico&rsquo;s actual independence came on September 16, 1810 when a Catholic priest named Father Miguel Hidalgo called for his<br>
flock of people in a small town called Dolores in Guanajuato<br>
province to rebel against their Spanish rulers.<br>
Iturbide is an embarrassment to Mexicans because once the Treaty of Cordoba was signed he declared himself emperor of New Spain, which he renamed Mexico.<br>
Iturbide then repudiated all the treaties made by Spain,<br>
Adams-Onis in particular, except ofcourse for the Cordoba Treaty which put him in power.<br>
Hardly a year passed by when a general in Iturbides army, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna overthrew him causing years of coups and counter-coups and the breakup of a dozen Mexican states in<br>
open rebellion against the central government in Mexico city.<br>
Several of these states formed their own governments but <br>
Santa Anna suppresed them all except Tejas, which in 1836 became the repblic of Texas.<br>
Mexico demanded it back and warned the US if it annexed Texas, there would be war.<br>
When James Polk became President in 1845, he promptly moved to accept Texas into the union.<br>
In 1846, the Mexican government was such a chaotic mess that it had 4 presidents, 6 war ministers, and 16 finance ministers that one year.<br>
Nonetheless, the Mexicans got what they wanted when 2,000 Mexican soldiers attacked 63 US soldiers on a border patrol at the Neuces river killing 11 and bringing on the Mexican-American war.<br>
InMarch of 1847, US forces secured most of Northern Mexico.<br>
Then General Winfield Scottlanded 12,000 soldiers at<br>
Veracruz, among them Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, and  Thomas Jackson later nicknamed &#8220;Stonewall.&#8221;<br>
After securing Veracruz, Scott marched to Mexico city to defeat the forces of Santa Anna who by then had seized the presidency for the sixth time at the Batte of Chapultepec of 1847.<br>
The war was over.<br>
General Winfield Scott was governor of Mexico city.<br>
The Mexican government existed in name only and many a US congressman and senator demanded that the US annex the entire<br>
country of Mexico.<br>
POlk turned this demand down.<br>
He declared instead that in exchange for the US upholding Mexican independence and ending the US military occupation,<br>
Mexico was to relinquish any claim to the territory of Texas and the Louisiana purchase, and that Mexico was to cede to the US its territory between the western border of the US (meaning Texas and the Missouri Territory of the purchase) and the Pacific Ocean, an area of over 500,000 square miles.<br>
Today we have 20 million illegals waiving signs as the Democrats and Republicans express their masochistic desire to see their own country destroyed.<br>
American&rsquo;s must vote our treasonous politicans out of office.</p>

<p><br>
He&rsquo;s right, of course.  But what he fails to mention is that mexico started that war and refused to give up until severely beaten into submission by the US.</p>
<p>And, of course, the US paid them a ton of gold for that land, after the fact.  One of the prime weaknesses of our country is we don&rsquo;t accept the simple fact that a nation has a right to win wars.</p>
<p>That attitude is behind much of problem with mexico today.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We lost because of the invasion and expansionist desires of our enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this mean that the US victory had nothing to do with the fact that Santa Anna was a tryannical despot with virtually no popular appeal among his own people?</p>

<p>Back when I used to watch his program I remember Bill O&rsquo;Reilly once had Vicente Fox on as a guest.  My first thought when I saw him was &#8220;white man.&#8221;  Then I was surprised to learn that indeed his grandfather was of European ancestry and hailed from either Cleveland or Cincinnati, don&rsquo;t remember which, one of those big cities in Ohio.  But still just another oppressed &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; in the eyes of your average unenlightened American.</p>

		<p>US Grant on the Mexican-American War of 1848</p>
<p>&#8220;For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory&#8221;</p>
<p>Worth noting that famous Whigs such as Henry Clay, and less famous ones like Abraham Lincoln, agreed and said such in public. Ironically and tragically, Clay&rsquo;s on son volunteered and died in the conflict.</p>

		<p>regarding Whig opposition to the Mexican War, I have long known about the anti-war sentiments of many abolitionists and others that feared-correctly- that slavery would spread into the west. </p>
<p>That being said, the Mexican War is truly a fine example of a war fought for the national interests of our country. A better result could not have been predicted and surely the victory over Mexico and purchase of all the lands north of the Rio Grande was a good thing. Only the War for Indepence and the Louisiana Purchase brought comparable gains in territory. </p>
<p>In general I follow Cicero&rsquo;s opinion that the only just wars are fought for self-defence or revenge, but in the case of the Mexican War I&rsquo;ll make an exception! BTW I would not have supported the Abolitionists in any case. </p>
