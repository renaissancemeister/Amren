<h1>Wal-Mart at Midnight at the End of the Month</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AR News, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bill Simon is head of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s American operations. At a conference on September 15 put on by Goldman Sachs, he said that there is a big jump in sales at the beginning of the month, when welfare payments arrive, with an &#8220;ever-increasing amount of transactions being paid for with government assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you need not go further than one of our stores on midnight at the end of the month. And it&rsquo;s real interesting to watch, about 11 p.m., customers start to come in and shop, fill their grocery basket with basic items, baby formula, milk, bread, eggs, and continue to shop and mill about the store until midnight, when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. government electronic benefits cards get activated and then the checkout starts and occurs. And our sales for those first few hours on the first of the month are substantially and significantly higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you really think about it, the only reason somebody gets out in the middle of the night and buys baby formula is that they need it, and they&rsquo;ve been waiting for it. Otherwise, we are open 24 hours  &mdash;  come at 5 a.m., come at 7 a.m., come at 10 a.m. But if you are there at midnight, you are there for a reason.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Along these lines, I used to notice that grocery stores were more crowded than usual around the first of the month.  But some time ago, they stopped being that way.  I asked the manager of one of the stores I frequented why this was, and he told me that the food stamp administration started not only using electronic cards to dole out food stamps, (in what turned out to be a futile attempt to stop fraud), but they&rsquo;re staggering the distribution dates based on the first letter of the recipient&rsquo;s last name, i.e. as you progress through the alphabet from A to Z, the later in the month you get your whole month&rsquo;s benefit.  The food stamp administration got so many complaints about really crowded grocery stores in certain areas at the first of the month, that it was crowding out cash customers.</p>

		<p>Now that&rsquo;s unsettling; how many people are paying for neccessities all over the country by actually shopping in the minutes just before their welfare benefits switch on at midnight every month? What are all those people doing the rest of the time? I could always find a day &#8220;cash&#8221; job doing yardwork, painting houses, turning over lawns with a spade and a pitchfork and even washing windows to supplement my income, but relying only on welfare, who lives like that?</p>

		<p>There is more to the story than just midnight grocery runs.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, the first day of every month is called &#8220;Mothers Day&#8221;. On Mothers Day the liquor store parking lots are jammed beyond capacity with past-their-prime Mercedes and Beemers and battered domestic dinosaurs that hadn&rsquo;t had gas in them for 28 days. Taxis and limos are rolling or double parked all over Lake Street and Broadway Avenue. The bars are jumping and the bootleggers and drug dealers will get no rest. Absentee fathers become temporary family men. The  Little Six Casino, Canterberry Park and the dog track over in nearby Somerset, WI are overran with noisy gamblers who are rich for a day.</p>
<p>This is repeated on a smaller scale on the 3rd of every month when the SSI payments hit the mailboxes and bank accounts of all the people who feigned mental illness and bad backs. First thing on every SSI recipient&rsquo;s TO DO LIST: Pay back or avoid the relatives and friends who financed their fun on Mothers Day. </p>
<p>A few days later the Target and Wal-Mart customer service lines will stretch all the way across the front of the store as the  broke moms and pseudo-handicapped people start bringing back all of the clothes and toys that seemed like a good idea 2 or 3 days ago when they were wealthy.</p>

		<p>I was brought up Catholic and am still very socially conservative (and dislike &#8220;dissenting&#8221; types).  But Jared Taylor&rsquo;s suggestion than welfare recipients be required to have lasting contraceptive implants for the duration of their welfare dependence was so eminently reasonable, so obviously right, that I couldn&rsquo;t help but be dragged along by the force of its logic.</p>
<p>What on Earth are we doing rewarding the multiplication of people who be definition are unwilling or unable to take care of themselves?  Who has the unmitigated gall necessary to present those supporting him with another mouth to feed?</p>

		<p>Wow I can remember when I was working on the road selling chemicals. I went to this town called Cotton Plant AR.. The whole damn town is on food stamps. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder we can&rsquo;t get a decent governor all of these folks know which side their bread is buttered on. There are hundreds of communities all across the delta in AR, MS, LA and TN. These communities are hold overs from the Lyndon Johnson era and the old war on poverty. </p>

		<p>Well, the latest statistics show one in seven Americans living in poverty or close to the poverty level. If things continue to get worse, the needy will grow in number. No one is going to put down a family with Mom and Dad both working, struggling to make ends meet, and getting some help via food stamps to feed the kids. The ones who wish to eventually earn more by whatever means so that they don&rsquo;t need food stamps, or those who are really trying hard to find a job to get off welfare are to be considered in a fair manner, with this charity as a temporary blessing no doubt. The truly disabled and elderly are the exception.</p>
<p>But the cheats, the bums, the welfare baby makers, the illegals, etc. who swap the food stamps for cigarettes and booze and drugs give the food stamp program a bad name and drain the resources (your pocket book). It&rsquo;s sad and a disgrace to say that too many of them do not intend to ever give up this assistance. How to solve the problem I don&rsquo;t know. If the government tries to monitor and regulate to a higher level with the goal of improving the situation, it will only end up becoming more abused and costly. In the case of food stamps, how do you determine of the forty million on the program who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? That&rsquo;s the question. What&rsquo;s the answer?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that even during the Great Depression, people received handouts from churches and other organizations, and soup kitchens kept people from starving. Charity is not a bad thing. Theft is.</p>
<p>As a footnote: in it&rsquo;s basic form government welfare can consist of: cash, food stamps, and medical assistance. It&rsquo;s gets complicated of course when other government programs are thrown in, and all the rules and factors involved in the recipient(s) home state are determined for qualification; but if anything, it seems the food stamps are the easiest to obtain, making it the easiest to manipulate.</p>

		<p>The schools take a huge hit on &#8216;Mother&rsquo;s Day&rsquo;, the first day of the month, as the loading up of the cards calls for an immediate all-day, all- family outing to the local Swap Meet, Kmart or Foor 4 Less to unload the new-found wealth (all in one day, it seems).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen kids desperately call home asking wether the &#8216;card is loaded&rsquo; or not, and if so, receive parent (in the singular) permission to leave school immediately.</p>
<p>The card may be loaded up at midnight, but the &#8216;parent&rsquo; in families such as these rarely functions before noon, if that.</p>
<p>Guess they want to hit the Swap Meet before all the good stuff is gone.</p>
<p>On another note, I&rsquo;ve noticed lately that many fast food joints now have signs displayed in the front window stating &#8220;We Accept EBT Cards!&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you know your local Subway and Dominoes are being subsidized by the government? (meaning YOU, the taxpayer, as the government has no money of its own).</p>
<p>As for Wal Mart, acceptance of &#8216;government assistance&rsquo; in exchange for goods is one more in a long line of transfer of wealth from the US to China  &mdash;  wealth they use to buy up American land and infrastructure.  Seems they don&rsquo;t like holding onto to the debased American dollars we continue to shovel into their coffers.</p>

		<p>If one is out shopping at midnight, I suppose we can presume they have no plans to go to work the following morning - which may explain much about their welfare situation. </p>

		<p>I think the &#8220;one in seven&#8221; in poverty statistic is a bit skewed. Just recently the requirement for food stamps was raised but is still 21,000 for a family of three. There are hardly situations where a two parent home is struggling and making it with foodstamps. More than likely dad is working two jobs, possibly even mom and barely seeing each other or the kids. I have worked delivering pizzas and often seen people in projects ordering 30 or so dollars worth of pizza. Of course they stiff the driver and were exceptionally rude. However they had all the new electronics, late model cars and nice jewelry.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who the good guys are, but I can tell you with complete certainty that the  bad guys are not the obvious suspects.</p>
<p>The bad guys are not the women who churn out a bunch of babies so that they could get bigger and better welfare benefits, nor are they the welfare-raised teens who get pregnant so that they can get their own place and their own check. The bad guys are not the convenience store owners who let people pay for their beer and wine with food stamp cards, the drug dealers who get a big dog&rsquo;s share of all of the welfare benefits paid out in the U.S., nor the guys who father children and leave it up to the taxpayers to feed them. </p>
<p>All of those people are just playing the game that our progressive leaders invented.</p>
<p>The bad guys are the politicians and the social-engineering political action groups behind them who developed and continue to maintain the programs that turned so many of our countrymen into dependents and gave them an entrenched place in our society.</p>
<p>The real question is:  How do we UNDO it? </p>
<p>We have on our hands a huge segment of our population whose only skill is to stick their hands out to the progressive system that gave birth to them. </p>
<p>It is politically impossible and more than a little bit cruel to just throw everybody off the dole. Besides, as gratifying as that would be to all of us who have been working overtime while the welfare class live off our tax dollars, such a solution would only create the more expensive problems of controlling and containing hordes of hungry, desperate people who have never had to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very helpful to tell them to get a job when there are no jobs to get. The same progressives who gave us the gift of welfare simultaneously blessed us with massive immigration of unskilled laborers. </p>
<p>Most of the jobs that used to be performed by Americans without skills have either been shipped to the third world or are now being performed by guest workers with green cards or illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>We need to fix this before we kick our state-raised countrymen out into the cold world. Until we control immigration and discourage off-shoring, the roads that lead away from welfare will remain closed.<br>

<p>A regular reader of my blog informs me that the major supermarket chain in the city where he lives, the grocery chain from which he worked before going to college, quietly accepted food stamps for just about anything, including alcohol.  He was told that blabbing would get him fired.</p>
<p>Now, this city is in a certain state, and I&rsquo;m trying to protect his identity, but I can tell you it&rsquo;s a state that the Federal government seems to like to sue these days.  There was a State Senator who wanted to crack down on this, to limit state-issued FS benefits (partially state funded) to be used only for items allowed under Federal guidelines.  According to to my reader, the Feds wanted to sue this state for passing this legislation, for enforcing their own food stamp law.</p>

		<p>My husband works for the VA Hospital. He said that towards the end of the month, they get a lot of vets who know how to manipulate the system to get themselves admitted to the psych ward, where they can avoid paying the drug dealer that they owe money to. They usually get discharged around the first of the month when their VA check is in the bank. This cycle repeats itself every month.</p>

		<p>Here in California they&rsquo;ve caught welfare recipients taking money out from their welfare cards at the casinos in the areas.  </p>
<p>It is also not uncommon to see people with more than one EBT (food stamp) card because they either have several identities or have &#8220;bartered/traded&#8221; in some fashion.</p>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that most welfare recipients no longer see it as a &#8220;helping hand&#8221; so they can &#8220;get on their own feet.&#8221;  Many view it as simultaneously a right, an entitlement, and something they are guaranteed because they&rsquo;re an American citizen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fed up with seeing my property taxes go up every year with a corresponding increase in county expenditures for &#8220;social services.&#8221;  Those of us that work and own our homes are subsidizing many these slackers in a lot of counties and states.  Our property taxes aren&rsquo;t fixing roads, upgrading utility services, etc.  They&rsquo;re buying groceries, gas, alcohol, and cigarettes for a bunch of people who refuse to better themselves or their situations.</p>
<p>Who really pays in the end - the people these programs were originally set up for: the ones that REALLY need it for awhile.   </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Many view it as simultaneously a right, an entitlement, and something they are guaranteed because they&rsquo;re an American citizen.</p>
<p>They view it as a right because they claim they&rsquo;re victims of White oppression.  This is explicitly told to them by the schools, media, their race-based advocates and the government.</p>
<p>Therefore Whites &#8216;owe them&rsquo;, for life  &mdash;  including any/all new immigrants, illegal or legal (who are told by race hustlers, ethnic studies teachers and regular schools that Whites &#8216;stole&rsquo; this land from their ancestors).</p>
<p>  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m fed up with seeing my property taxes go up every year with a corresponding increase in county expenditures for &#8216;social services.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet our government continues to import large numbers of non-White, unskilled, low IQ, fecund, life-long welfare dependents.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Who really pays in the end - the people these programs were originally set up for: the ones that REALLY need it for awhile.</p>
<p>We Whites will really need it soon, after the government has extracted our last dollar, redistributed our property and locked us out of every college and career possible in favor of non-Whites.</p>
<p>I am seeing, with increasing frequency, desperate, middle-aged White homeless along the freeways, on the streets, begging at the bottom of off-ramps, approaching me for a handout.  What ever starts here in California will move across the nation.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t expect to receive anything from your government if/when you or your loved ones might need food or shelter.  To them, you are a worthless, expendable White Kulak, good only until you&rsquo;re landless and broke, your pension gone and then&hellip;..</p>
