			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Spector and Alexandra Berzon, Wall Street Journal, Spetember 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michael Thomas, a Pequot Indian with a brash leadership style and a checkered past, was a driving force behind turning Foxwoods Resort Casino into one of the world&rsquo;s largest casinos, and for making tribal members rich in the process. These days, he&rsquo;s being cast as the man who triggered a financial crisis.</p>
<p>With gambling revenues sinking and a showdown with lenders looming, Mr. Thomas vowed last summer to protect dividend payments to tribal members  &mdash;  as high as $120,000 a year for some  &mdash;  before reimbursing creditors owed more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>That audacious move spooked banks and bondholders. Other Pequot leaders, fearing a backlash, disavowed Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s comments and ousted him as chairman of the tribal council. As the crisis worsened, the tribe stopped making debt payments. In July, tribal leaders did exactly what Mr. Thomas said he wouldn&rsquo;t: They said they will halt the payouts that have put two or more BMWs in the driveways of some tribal members, and have made the Mashantucket Pequots the envy of the Indian gambling world. Lenders are now trying to hammer out a debt-restructuring deal with the tribe.</p>
<p>The financial mess on this tiny reservation in rural eastern Connecticut has rattled the once-booming business of casinos run by American Indians, drawing attention to the ramifications of their unique legal status. Tribal-owned casinos can&rsquo;t be forced into bankruptcy, many experts say, because tribes are sovereign nations. And federal law allows no one but Indians themselves to operate casinos on reservations, which effectively prevents creditors from seizing them and selling them off.</p>
<p>The showdown between the Pequots and their lenders, which include Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., has raised what was once an unthinkable question: What happens if a sovereign tribe defaults?</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual route through which these problems are resolved is that equity disappears,&#8221; meaning that owners are wiped out, said Mr. Thomas, 42 years old, during an interview at his reservation home. &#8220;My people are not equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s vow has stoked fears among other Indian leaders that it will become more difficult for tribes nationwide to borrow money. His letter to fellow Pequots &#8220;was a statement that investments in tribes are not safe and that tribes will try to figure out some way to get out of them, and that is not the case,&#8221; says Bob Garcia, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in Oregon.</p>
<p>Wall Street used to shy away from lending to tribes. But in the late 1990s, after lawyers crafted language in loan documents waiving tribes&rsquo; sovereign protections from being sued in state or federal courts, the Indian-gambling debt market took off. Loans were secured by cash flow from the casinos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another development that alarmed investors occurred in April, when a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that a $50 million bond deal was invalid because it violated federal Indian casino law.</p>
<p>The decision, which is under appeal, could mean that the 3,500-member Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians won&rsquo;t have to pay back its lenders. That worried investors, even though the bond terms that the judge found problematic are unique to that deal, Indian-gambling lawyers say.</p>
<p>Many tribes haven&rsquo;t amassed debt burdens as large as the Pequots did for Foxwoods. Only a handful have defaulted on debt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That, in turn, could hurt the tens of thousands of Indians across the country who rely on casino revenue to fund local governments and economies, says Mr. Garcia of Oregon&rsquo;s Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use the money from casinos to fund scholarships for students and health-care benefits, pay for things for elders,&#8221; he says. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Pequots failed to pay about $7 million of interest on $500 million in bonds, putting the tribe in default. They also missed a July 13 deadline to repay a $700 million credit line from banks. The banks have agreed to forbear to give the tribe time to cut a deal with bondholders, who rank below the banks in the pecking order of creditors.</p>
<p>In most debt restructurings, lenders agree to forgo some or all of the money they are owed, often getting new stock in return. But because federal Indian gambling law bars anyone but tribes from having ownership stakes in casinos, Foxwoods&rsquo; lenders can&rsquo;t take equity. That removes a big enticement for them to forgive debt. Federal law also bars Foxwoods&rsquo; lenders from operating a casino on Indian land, making foreclosure an unattractive option.</p>
<p>Those restrictions have given the tribe leverage in negotiations. The Pequots have asked bondholders to slash the total they are owed.</p>
<p>Bondholders don&rsquo;t want to do that, but some of them have offered to stop receiving interest for a time and to push back repayment deadlines. Last week, a committee of bank lenders proposed a middle ground, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>

<p>Well, no one ever considered this, did they?</p>
<p>Those American Indian nations have a legal standing UNIQUE in the entire world. Are sovereign nations with sovereign territory while the members of the various American Indian nations are also at the same time citizens of the U.S.</p>
<p>Who says whitey is prejudiced? NOW whitey has a debt to collect and cannot get the money back. That UNIQUE standing was not considered by lawyers representing the banks in the first place.</p>
<p>These casinos are a bad idea anyhow? NOT really jobs and money earned in the &#8220;honest way&#8221;? Those several BMW in the driveway do not make up for the &#8220;stuff&#8221; that goes with the gambling and &#8220;gaming&#8221; business? </p>

		<p>Mixed in with this is the odd and seldom-mentioned fact that the &#8216;Native American Nations&rsquo; get away with REAL racism; deciding who is and who is not a &#8216;real&rsquo; Native American and bestowing or withholding benefits accordingly; the example given here on AMREN not so long ago was the odd status of those persons descended from the slaves the Trail of Tears deportees like the Cherokees took with them to Oklahoma before the Civil War.</p>

		<p>How does this affect the casinos owned by the Mashantuckets that are being built in Pennsylvania but NOT on Indian lands? Would creditors be able to take possesion/ownership of the casino? </p>

<p>And those descendants of escaped black slaves that had fled to FLA to live with the Seminole as if they were tribal members. Same with them. Living as &#8220;freemen&#8221; but when resettled to OK never did attain full tribal status recently ousted. Excluded from the normal rights of a tribal member. ONLY a Seminole can be a Seminole. NO others.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #3  &mdash;  If the creditors have a valid recorded mortgage or deed of trust against a piece of property that has a recorded deed and plat in a PA county, then yes they can take over property. But if they repossess the property, they won&rsquo;t be able to operate it as a casino unless they are card carrying BIA Native Americans.</p>

<p>What we are dealing with here, with these Indian tribal reservations,  is the concept of ALLODIAL LAND   &mdash;    a very rare concept and just about non-existent in the English-speaking world.  Allodial title is absolute and unrestricted ownership of land,  independent of any superior authority, owing no recognition, indebtedness,  or obligation to anyone.<br>
 <br>
 <i>&#8220;Allodial land is land which is absolute property of the owner, held in absolute independence, without being subject to any rent, service, condition, or acknowledgment of any kind to any superior.  <br>
In the United States, all land is subject to eminent domain by the federal government, and  thus there is no true allodial land in the USA.  A slight exception to this rule would be the Indian reservations.&#8221;   [Wiki] </i> </p>
<p>As someone  said elsewhere, &#8220;No one really owns the land.&#8221; This is true. Traditionally, the king, czar, monarch, sovereign, was the only, the  final and ultimate owner of all the land in the realm.  The crown was the font and guarantor of all wealth, social titles, land titles, property, benefits.  All land was held under him, the sovereign.  In the USA,  upon receiving  independence, the state replaced the King of England as the ultimate owner of all real property. <br>
  <br>
[&#8220;The Treaty of Paris (1783) which recognized American independence, transferred the rights of the British crown  to the state as the new ultimate landowner.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Thus, in reality, the &#8220;owners&#8221; of the land  just &#8220;hold&#8221; it   &mdash;   for their lifetimes or that of their heirs&hellip; but ultimately that land comes from the crown and will revert to the crown  (or in republics, the state). The crown, or state, also reserves the right to reclaim the land (which is its land)  at any time if it so desires (as for a highway or other public need). Thus a &#8220;landowner&#8221; is really  just a land<i>HOLDER</i>. He does not &#8220;own&#8221; the land in any absolute sense.  His land  is subject to the law, taxation, police powers, and many other restrictions. He cannot do with it whatever he pleases. </p>
<p>However,  on the  European continent, in some exceptional cases,  an allodial grant was made to a member of royalty   &mdash;  -  a dowager queen, for instance, thus making her the absolute and total owner of her lands, in perpetuity,  beholden to no one, not subject to condemnation or eminent domain, owing no taxes, conscription, services, or anything else to a higher authority.  Nor could those lands be taken from her <i>under any circumstances.  </i> They were HERS, and forever.  Thus, she was sovereign on her own lands;  it was the closest thing to total independence. Church lands were also, once, allodial properties, exempt from authority or taxation of the crown, something that caused great friction over the centuries. I believe that allodial lands came to an end in England when Henry VIII confiscated church property. </p>
<p>There is no such thing today as  allodial land in England today(or in English common law) where all land is  held  <i>&#8220;of the crown&#8221;. </i>   Nor in the Commonwealth countries.  Some Commonwealth countries (particularly Australia) recognize &#8220;native title&#8221;, a form of allodial title that does not originate from the crown, and  which predates the authority of the crown.   Canada also recognizes a form of native title (&#8220;aboriginal title&#8221;).   We in the USA have approximated that with our Indian reservations which are also, considerably (but not totally), outside the reach of the civil authorities, being exempt from taxation and even having their own police forces and tribal law. </p>
<p>In Latin America, some universities  enjoy what amounts to allodial rights, where they have their own laws and are exempt from police intrusion. This tradition comes down from the Middle Ages.   (And some North American universities, and churches too, also like to <i>think</i> they have allodial rights!)</p>
<p>As I said above, regarding church lands, this concept of allodial title has always been a source of friction as to whose authority begins or ends where.  Historically, it has caused much trouble. But generally, except for the church, it was very rare. Most modern states have abolished it.<br>
