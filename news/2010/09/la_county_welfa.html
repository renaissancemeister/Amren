			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, September 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Welfare payments to children of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles County increased in July to $52 million, prompting renewed calls from one county supervisor to rein in public benefits to such families.</p>
<p>The payments, made to illegal immigrants for their U.S. citizen children, included $30 million in food stamps and $22 million from the CalWorks welfare program, according to county figures released Friday by Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich.</p>
<p>The new figure represents an increase of $3.7 million from July 2009 and makes up 23% of all county welfare and food stamp assistance, according to county records.</p>
<p>Last year, welfare and food stamp issuances totaled nearly $570 million, and the amount is projected to exceed $600 million this year. In addition, county taxpayers spend $550 million in public safety  &mdash;  mostly for jail costs  &mdash;  and nearly $500 million for healthcare for illegal immigrants, Antonovich said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shirley Christensen of the county Department of Public Social Services said the number of households with illegal immigrant parents and U.S. citizen children receiving welfare increased by 7% from January to June of this year.</p>

		<p>We have to face it. California is gone. Gone is the &#8220;Golden State&#8221;; the land of warm weather, crystal oceans, white beaches, the land the Beach Boys and countless others wrote and sang about from 1830 to 1975. It has been overrun by legal and illegal immigrants from every corner of the planet, and they were aided and abetted by rich and famous blacks and liberal whites in every political and entertainment venue in the country. From Madame Pelosi to Governor Terminater to every 3rd rate &#8220;actor&#8221; and &#8220;actress&#8221; that could get their face on the large or small screen. (All singing the praises of the Mulatto Messiah, naturally&hellip;)<br>
I&rsquo;ve lived in California, and up until about 1980 it was a halfway decent place to live, (*with the exception of the large cities on the coast.) You couldn&rsquo;t pay me to set foot across the state border now. Any white persons still living there need to get up and move out of the state as fast as possible. Soon their very lives will depend on it, if they don&rsquo;t already.<br>
If you live in California, ask yourself why you  move from your gated and baricaded home to your locked car, to your gated and barricaded  place of employment? Why do you fear to walk your dog, jog in the park, go to the beach, or let your child attend the nearest public elementary school? Is this the way to enjoy the riches heaven bestowed on California and sub-human, non-whites turned into Hell on Earth?</p>

<p>They tell us illegals aren&rsquo;t getting government money and yet they tracked an INCREASE. You can&rsquo;t record and increase unless you&rsquo;re keeping track of previous numbers.</p>

		<p>I went to wal mart last night, and got some food, not allot maybe $50.00 since that is all I can afford and thats all cheap stuff. In front of me was a rather fat Mexican woman about 22, 2 Mex men who looked healthy and able to work and 3 kids all under 6 years old. They had 2 shopping carts full of the best food and meats money can buy. When it was time to pay, she pulled out her food stamp card with a big smile and a twinkle in her eye. <br>
I sometimes wonder why I work because no matter how hard I work or how many hours, I will never live as good as Mexicans or blacks on welfare. This happened in Dinuba CA.. gotta give this little town its due respect.</p>

		<p>Welfare? welfare? How can that be? I distinctly remember the most honest President in American History, Bill &#8220;I Feel Your Pain&#8221; Clinton, swearing on Monica&rsquo;s dress that his welfare program did not include illegal immigrants, nor even green carders. Surely this is a Tea Party disinformation plot orchestrated by 100 year old Nazis hiding out in Paraguay?</p>

		<p>I debate the subject of illegal immigration as often as I can with as many people as I can, so I&rsquo;m slowly getting versed in the subject. One counter-argument I hear from those I talk to on the left is that well, yes, we may have to pay to feed their kids, pay for the entire family&rsquo;s health care, and pay to jail their dads, all to the tune of $1.5 billion per year in SoCal alone&hellip; but when the ledger is all balanced out, illegal immigration is a net economic positive for the economy, and thus, not as bad a thing as we evil, racist nativists make it out to be.</p>
<p>I say let&rsquo;s really get to the bottom of it. I would like to see a study that honestly tackles the issue of economic costs and benefits. They say we benefit, but who really enjoys most of the economic benefits of illegal immigration? My guess is that it&rsquo;s not the middle class, and certainly not the lower middle class. Factor in everything: the overcrowded schools full of kids who don&rsquo;t speak English (very common in LA), an overburdened, crumbling infrastructure, the effects of illegal immigration on unemployment, the straining health care system - even intangibles like the social tensions and alienation caused by migratory displacement. If I were a social scientist this study would be at the top of the list. If anyone knows any good studies I&rsquo;d like to read them.</p>

		<p>Birthright-based citizenship should be abolished as soon as possible. It&rsquo;s obvious that many children are being born for the sole purpose of guaranteeing welfare checks. Although ending birthright-based citizenship won&rsquo;t stop the blacks from having children to exploit the welfare system, stopping the Mexicans would make a good dent. </p>

		<p>It was a funny few days in LA&hellip;our slightly less communist paper the Daily News ran an article poo-pooing the idea of anchor babies, saying it just doesn&rsquo;t happen, while our Pravda downtown ran this article showing that anchors are nearly a quarter of the welfare/food stamp rolls.  You gotta make sure were all the on the same propaganda page, guys!</p>

		<p>Illegals also get section 8 housing and I read a report that stated they get over 60% of available section 8 housing in LA county. That includes all their gang members are living off our dime while they stab us in the back. Wish I could get a voucher for my rent since I pay most of my SSA check in rent.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #2, you&rsquo;re absolutely correct, but where do you suggest we Californians move?  Every state is being invaded now.  My friends and relatives in other states are all complaining that they have to deal with businesses whose employees don&rsquo;t speak English, that anchor babies are getting free lunches at their kids&rsquo; schools, Mexican mariachi music is blasting from the neighbors&rsquo; homes all night long, cars are repeatedly stolen or broken into, etc., etc.  &mdash;   all of the problems that we in California have suffered with for so long!  Other states might be a bit behind California, but they&rsquo;re being invaded, too, and it won&rsquo;t be long before there&rsquo;s no place left to run.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration is becoming a problem in Ohio, too  &mdash;  even in the more rural areas.</p>
<p>Contrary to what most believe, anchor babies are not, nor have ever been, American citizens.  People need to realize that.</p>
