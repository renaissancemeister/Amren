<h1><a href="https://www.edgefielddaily.com/aiken090410.html">Suspected Murderer Indicates &#8216;Hatred&rsquo; for White Race, Law Enforcement</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edgefield Daily (Edgefield, South Carolina), September 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man wanted in connection to two recent murders in Aiken County as well as arson is also suspected in the brutal beating of a female Richmond County business owner on Wednesday night who remains in critical condition as of Friday. Information obtained on Friday shows racial hostility could also be playing a roll in the choice of his victims. Franklin Wright, 55, of Aiken County is considered to be on foot, armed, and &#8220;extremely dangerous&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wright is described as a black male, 6 feet tall and weighing 195 pounds. No current clothing description is available.</p>
<p>According to a national broadcast obtained on Friday, Wright is &#8220;armed and dangerous&#8221; and &#8220;writings found in his home indicate hatred for (the) white race and law enforcement&#8221;. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Aiken County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has already issued arrest warrants for Wright in connection to the August 11, murders of 38-year-old Shalamar N. Byrd, of Bream Ave. in Augusta Ga. and 75-year-old Yana Peters Schenker of Aiken. Both women were strangled and then their bodies set on fire and discovered the same night in Aiken County. Both women were white.</p>
<p>No official press release from area law enforcement mentions the racial overtones and they are not indicating his crimes as &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; at this time. {snip}</p>

		<p>This shameful reporting call us all to a closer accounting of our systemic and institutional biases against the black community. Jesse Jackson said &#8220;Black folks are the moral story of this county,&#8221; so we should allow newspapers to report stories that reflect poorly on his community.  He also said that crime in New Orleans after Katrina was being over reported, which means any crime story about a black is over reporting.</p>
<p>These stories only give raciss more fuel for their hatred and extremism, and lead to violence against innocent blacks. Some stories are just too hateful to report.</p>

<p>Of course, the article then goes on to say that he should be &ldquo;approached with caution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps, it would be best, especially for law enforcement, to approach him with aggression and the intent of either subduing him or if need be, exterminating him. This is not a &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxpayer;&rdquo; this is a homicidal and nonwhite parasite, who has gone toward thinking that he is more important than the host he feeds off of. </p>

		<p>And why AREN&rsquo;T they considering it a hate crime?  Why is it universally that obvious hate crimes committed by blacks against whites are NEVER charged as such?  Simple.<br>
With Holder as AG and Obama in the white house, there would never be a conviction.<br>
A charge of &#8220;hate crime&#8221; is a FEDERAL charge and a FEDERAL enhancement to the primary charge.  Therefore it has to go before federal judges and they have their marching orders from team Holder/Obama.  Only whites can commit hate crimes. Also, in the cops favor, there is no death penalty on the federal level (except for treason or terrorism or the killing of a federal civil servant).  If they want to fry this guy, they need to keep the Feds (and Obama and Holder) out of it.  </p>

		<p>So he hits middle age, realizes he&rsquo;s a loser and isn&rsquo;t going to make it big, so he decides it must be the fault of the world.  What else is a brother gonna do?  He HAS to rape and murder white women, it&rsquo;s the only way he can gain self-respect in his convoluted racist world.  I&rsquo;m sick of hearing horrors at the hands of morons who blame my color for their failures and misdeeds.  The race card is SO over.  This guy needs to be executed.  But I&rsquo;d say the same about a white psychopath.<br>

		<p>A &#8220;hatred for (the) white race and law enforcement.&#8221;  Sounds like every black African.  The topic of race is always on black people&rsquo;s minds which is why it&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish an anti-white hate crime versus a non-racially biased crime commited by black people.</p>

A white perp expressing his hatred for blacks,law enforcement and this would be a story.Reporting blacks killing whites and making a big deal of it is bad for business.It&rsquo;s just the the same old story over and over.

		<p> We all know that if this murderer were a White man who had killed and burned two black women, and had expressed &#8220;hatred&#8221; of the black race, it would be nationwide news. The Mulatto Messiah would be making yet another of his speeches about &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and the like. The Revs. Al and Jesse would be doing a furious stomp about &#8220;White racism&#8221; and &#8220;open season on blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p> But since he&rsquo;s black, and his victims are White, the racial angle is being downplayed to the maximum extent possible. Anyone want to bet a steak dinner that we&rsquo;ll see anything about this on any of the mainstream media outlets? No fair including Fox News in the list, although I suspect they&rsquo;ll flinch, too.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;d have been no trouble finding &#8220;hate&#8221; if this had been a White murderer preying on black victims.</p>
<p>As it is, though, even if this black savage publicly announced his plans to slaughter the entire White race, you wouldn&rsquo;t hear a peep about &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; from anyone but us Evil White Nationalists.</p>
<p>Say, if this killer&rsquo;s crimes don&rsquo;t have any &#8220;hate&#8221; in them, what does that make them?  Love crimes?</p>

		<p>Another article states that Jenny Hope, the White lady that is in critical condition, had befriended Wright and allowed him to work odd jobs around her store.  It also said that she frequently worked alone at her store.  Though I feel for her, she seems like another bleeding heart liberal tempted fate.  Had she been reading American Renaissance, chances are great that she wouldn&rsquo;t be in the condition she finds herself in now.</p>

		<p>It would be &#8216;racist&rsquo; to suggest that blacks are afflicting whites. It&rsquo;s not racist, but &#8216;education&rsquo; to play up white violence against others, no matter that one type of violence happens 10 times more often than the other. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly these crimes will not even make it to the national news. But you can just imagine the consequences if the racial circumstances had been in reverse: Al Sharpton and Brian Williams parachuting to the scene; The Southern Poverty Law Center designating a 5-state perimeter &#8220;Hate Zone&#8221;; President Obama announcing this is not the time for calm; dead frogs dropping from the sky; the Attorney General threatening to &#8220;discuss race&#8221; (God, anything but that); the magnetic North and South Poles reversing their polarity; Hollywood rough-drafting the screenplay (with Morgan Freeman narrating) &hellip; </p>
<p>But then statistically speaking these things rarely happen in reverse. And, ironically, all we supposedly &#8220;angry &hellip; fearful &hellip; racist&#8221; white people just shake our heads in sadness and get up the next day and go back to our jobs.</p>
<p>All gallows humor aside, what a terrible, terrible tragedy for these innocent women and their families. Prayers and best wishes go out to them.<br>

<p>since no &#8216;official&rsquo; comment regarding the &#8216;hatred&rsquo; is being released, it&rsquo;s not being treated as a hate crime.   Ahhh. the wide brush of liberal justice paints another broad stroke over our &#8216;news&rsquo; and &#8216;justice&rsquo;.  </p>

That will be their big opportunity to jockey for tenure by signing a resolution that some forms of violence against White Humanity are &#8220;legitimate rage against injustice&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well, well. This makes me think about a host of things. Did anyone else notice how fast the story of the racist Hartford, CT shooter went away? The victims  &mdash;  how many again?  &mdash;  went into the cold ground, and that was the end of that. Will PBS be doing a documentary a few years from now, like they did on the Central Park Jogger, Freddy&rsquo;s Fashion Mart, Colin Ferguson, the shooting of little Kayla Rolland&hellip;.oh wait a sec, none of that ever happened. But they do still have the Selma march footage playing on continuous loop, I&rsquo;m sure. My point is this: these daily examples of cold, cruel bias are calculated slaps in the face of Euro-Americans, and of ALL Americans of good will. It almost seems the media relish grinding our faces in it  &mdash;  they KNOW what the social engineering of the cultural Marxists did to us, and they taunt us with it and order us to celebrate it. The brief coverage of the Hartford shooting, such as it was, focused more on how the shooter &#8220;felt&#8221; and how he CLAIMED to have been treated (no proof) than his victims or their families. Who even heard the victims&rsquo; names? File this one next to Chris Newsome and Channon Christian and Jake Robel. I suppose they were all mere eggs to be broken on the way to Multi Culti Utopia. And this extends even beyond racial crimes; how many people know, say, Jesse Dirkheising&rsquo;s name as compared to Matthew Shepard&rsquo;s? Only their protected classes matter, and to HELL on greased rails with everyone else. A FREE press might scrutinize the effects of racialist social engineering and Orwellian mind bending on four generations of white kids. It might examine the savage effects of abortion on demand on European-American demographics, and how that folds into the planned population replacement of whites who never got to be born with collectivist Third Worlders. It might study the social problems posed for white youngsters since disasters like busing, the &#8216;65 immigration act, etc. were perpetrated, who are minorities in their own communitie. (I lived that myself.) Kids who can&rsquo;t find enough compatible available whites of the opposite sex for dating, marriage, and relationships. It might explore the FACT that something just goes out of an area when white cultural life and mores diminish, European-American businesses close or leave, beleaguered whites give up and move away, hastening increases in crime, loss of neighborliness, familiarity and cohesion, loss of historical sense because the people who built the city/town are dead or gone, decline of classic architecture and infrastructure, loss of loyalty to American ideals and principles and on and on.  A real media might ask those questions.  Then the alarm clock goes off and I wake up. On the plus side, Lady Karma recently paid a little visit to one Mister Lemerick Nelson. Now THAT made my week.</p>

		<p>There is a story on the internet that I hope AmRen picks up, about a black U. of Florida football player who was arrested for stalking and threatening his ex-girlfriend. And yes the girl is white, and now wants the charges dropped saying the police overreacted.</p>

		<p>I first found AmRen a number of years ago while conducting research for a book I considered writing.  Almost twenty years ago I investigated a case involving the planned kidnapping, gang rape and torture of a white woman.  The black suspects decided to make a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to commit the crime and they followed through.  They viciously murdered the victim when they were done with her and dumped her body by side of a rural road.  Longtime AmRen readers probably remembers this incident, but for those that don&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t do a search for Joseph Martin Luther Gardner and probably still find the details on the site.</p>
<p>Despite the specific goal of choosing a white woman as the victim and despite the black racist literature and hate filled personnel writings found during the execution of search warrants, the lead investigators and police administration refused to call this a racially motivated crime.  Even after obtaining statements from several suspects that this was the case.</p>
<p>Two years ago I was blessed to make a trip to the death chamber and watch Gardner put to death.  One of the most satisfying moments of my career.</p>
<p>I still plan to write a book about the case, but I will wait until the victim&rsquo;s wonderful parents are deceased and won&rsquo;t be susceptible to any further wounds to their kind souls.</p>

Blacks are a race of haters and losers. I disagree that they commit violent crimes because of &lsquo;discrimination&rsquo; There are other groups of people have been discriminated and killed at much harsher and higher rates than blacks, but you don&rsquo;t see them going around and killing people and committing crimes, do you?<br>
 to repeat myself, If hate, discrimination and persecution/genocide were an excuse for criminal behavior then Jews should be the most dangerous people in the world.</p>
