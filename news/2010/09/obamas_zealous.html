<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Zealous Civil Rights Enforcer Gets Busy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron York, Washington Examiner, August 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt Tom Perez [head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division] is hopping a lot these days. Of all the transformations that have taken place in the Obama administration, perhaps none is so radical as that within the Civil Rights Division. Under Perez, it is bigger, richer and more aggressive than ever, with a far more expansive view of its authority than at any time in recent history.</p>
<p>Perez is playing a leading role in the Justice Department&rsquo;s lawsuit against Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law. He is promising a huge increase in prosecution of alleged hate crimes. He vows to use &#8220;disparate impact theory&#8221; to pursue discrimination cases where there is no intent to discriminate but a difference in results, such as in test scores or mortgage lending, that Perez wants to change. He is even considering a crackdown on Web sites on the theory that the Internet is a &#8220;public accommodation&#8221; as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>To do all this, Perez has come up with some novel ideas. For example, in a recent lending discrimination case, he forced the defendant  &mdash;  who settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing  &mdash;  to pay not only the alleged victims but to funnel $1 million to unrelated &#8220;qualified organizations&#8221; to conduct social programs.</p>
<p>Perez is pushing just as hard on smaller issues. In a little-noticed move last year, he threatened several universities because they took part in an experimental program to allow students to use the Amazon Kindle for textbooks. At the time, the Kindle was not fully accessible to blind students, and under pressure from Perez the schools agreed not to offer the e-reader to any students until it was fully accessible to all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Heading the Civil Rights Division is the opportunity of a lifetime for Perez. A former aide to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, he was an activist and later a councilman in Montgomery County, Md., where he made a name for himself pushing in-state tuition and drivers&rsquo; licenses for illegal immigrants. Now, he&rsquo;s on a much bigger stage.</p>

		<p>Tom Perez, a living breathing reincarnation, with chile pepper blood, of the late great murderer, rapist and drunk Ted Kennedy, Tommy&rsquo;s former boss. Thanks to Ted the Philander, our immigration restrictions flew out the window when the focus of the nation was fixed on Vietnam. (How come Teddy Boy, relatively young at the time, wasn&rsquo;t called up to Vietnam as part of the Army Reserve, which he was part of?)</p>
<p>Now Mr. Civil Rights, Tomas, won&rsquo;t let people use Kindle if the blind can&rsquo;t see it. Well,retarded and low IQ folks infest our schools, so why not enjoin all the standardized tests and SATs until everyone can pass them? In other words, send a retarded Hispanic black from Panama who is illegal to Harvard. </p>
<p>Well, I guess we did that already, at least the equivalent. We sent Teddy Kennedy, noted drunk D scholar. to Harvard on the back of his Daddy&rsquo;s whorehouse profits, Mafia payoffs, and stock market fraud. And Teddy then begat Tomas, of the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; division.</p>
<p>Lotsa Justice in Justice these days. </p>

		<p>The egalitarianism has finally grown beyond it&rsquo;s own boundries it seems.  The bit about the kindle is simply the most absurd thing I have ever heard.  Screw human progress unless everybody is invovled seems to be the message.</p>
<p>Maybe Perez should ban football and basketball next due to only one player at a time being able to touch the ball.</p>

		<p>A lawyer and civil rights experts comments on Disparate Impact Theory and the civil rights act of 1991</p>
<blockquote><p>The plaintiffs [suing over employment test results] rely on a controversial concept known as &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; theory - a sort of &#8220;guilty until proven innocent&#8221; approach to charges of discrimination. Instead of focusing on concrete examples of bias by identifiable bureaucracies or individuals, disparate-impact analysis looks to statistical disparities. It says courts should infer discrimination if the results of a test or policy don&rsquo;t parallel the community&rsquo;s racial makeup.</p>
<p>This insistence on a predetermined racial outcome doesn&rsquo;t square with common sense. Skills and aptitudes vary among people of every racial group, and all kinds of individual factors play a role in how test-takers perform on even the most objective exam.</p>
<p>Moreover, an employment test should be measured, first and last, by whether the questions test skills and knowledge that are essential for the job - especially with jobs that, like firefighting, are crucial for public safety.</p>
<p>Disparate impact may not make a lot of sense as an analytical approach, but that didn&rsquo;t stop it from being written into federal law. Congress adopted it as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, signed by President George H.W. Bush. <b>His White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray, acknowledged that the main goal wasn&rsquo;t really to fight discrimination, but to produce a more racially balanced work force.</b></p>https://community.pacificlegal.org/Page.aspx?pid=1206</blockquote>

		<p>sbuffalonative, that is exactly what they are doing to us here in Arizona.  Fortunately we are being helped financially by people from all over the country. They are trying to make an example of Arizona because they fear the entire nation will follow us, which they are.  </p>

		<p>The new totalitarians are far worse than anything we&rsquo;ve had before. To find anything similar it&rsquo;s necessary to read the policies of Stalinist Russia and the Maoist doctrines.</p>
<p>These people mostly are certifiably mentally disturbed, and I say that objectively with no malice intended.  Anybody who finds something to &#8220;hop&#8221; about while the country is in the process of crashing and burning needs his head worked on full time in an asylum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad commentary on the state of affairs for many people to be wishing for total governmental collapse ASAP, because it is the only thing that will get the ball rolling to oust these oddballs from positions of authority.  If the Republicans are in charge after November, it will make little difference to these fanatics of the community organizer and the community organizer himself.  They&rsquo;ll continue their &#8220;in-your-face&#8221; insanity unchecked.  They DO NOT live in the real world, but a perverted one of their own making.</p>
<p>The situation is deteriorating as forecast by the experts at a faster pace than orginally described, but the Obama factor has caused an acceleration.</p>
<p>There were 30,000 people who showed up in Georgia for 450 low housing units by the feds; food banks have been lower than at any time in recent memory, and they&rsquo;re not expecting them to be adequately replenished in the forseeable future.  </p>
<p>Sometimes thousand of applications are submitted for just one job, and what few low tier jobs blacks can do usually go to Mexicans.  Black unemployment is higher than it has ever been, and 41 million citizens are on food stamps so far this year with that figure expecting to increase each month, then an acceleration is expected in 2011.   So the pot is ready to boil over with the usual black discontent.  They aren&rsquo;t getting any immediate privileges from Obama&rsquo;s policies, so they are probably going to take to the streets to show their discontent.</p>
<p>The next important forecast has not arrived in all its splendor yet.  What is it?  </p>
<p>Unchecked crime.  Projections by those who do OBJECTIVE definitive tracking know that as the economy continues to deteriorate and falls to a certain level, large urban areas like New York, Chicago and LA, are going to be rife with kidnappings for ransom of VIP&rsquo;s.  Robberies, burglaries, muggings all will abound and it will be impossible to park overnight in many areas without a vehicle being stolen or ransacked and stripped down of all saleable items like the stereo, DVD, radio and tires. </p>
<p>And at about the point armed conflicts are common, these large urban areas will be on a par with the crime capital of North America:  Mexico City.  </p>
<p>So claim the experts, and, chillingly, they&rsquo;ve been 100% correct so far.</p>
<p>And what will Tom Perez be doing as the deterioration is in full swing?  Well, we can only guess, but if his claims to be happy &#8220;hopping&#8221; during the beginning of a depression, certainly he will develop his entire routine into a full fledged cha cha about that time.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s lucid enough at times to understand that all of this is going to make any gains he feels he&rsquo;s instigated null and void?  Or will he miss it all because he&rsquo;ll be interconnecting his fingers and reciting, &#8220;Here&rsquo;s the church, and here&rsquo;s the steeple, open the door and out come the people,&#8221; or something similar to keep him entertained when he isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hopping&#8221; around with glee.</p>

		<p>Civil rights has just degenerated into a racket. A large industry has grown up around this enterprise; lots of people have been making a good living out of all this. This one person seems to be taking it to bizarre lengths, but without anything being done to curb him he&rsquo;ll just keep running amuck. Most businesses are just hoping to avoid having people like this to focus upon them; they&rsquo;re running scared. From where will the fightback to this extortion come from?  </p>

		<p>You are right, Chicagoan, in all but one respect.  Civil Rights was ALWAYS a racket.<br>
It was ALWAYS about bludgeoning whites into giving to blacks things they had not earned, and often did not deserve.  It was ALWAYS about the money and defiling your daughters, and never about the vote, equal respect, or equal opportunity.  Too strong a statement?  Look up on wiki what Martin Luther King was doing his last night on earth.  FBI tapes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Disparate impact?&#8221; How could there not be a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; when almost all of the illegal aliens in Mexico are from Latin American nations? </p>
<p>The position of the Department of Justice is patently absurd. It reminds of the cocktail party scene in the motion picture adaptation of &#8220;Death Wish&#8221; in which someone accuses the vigilante of being a bigoted racist. Another guest challenges this statement by asking if it would be alright if the vigilante selected his targets on an &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; basis?</p>

		<p>The doctrine of &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; is easily one of the most evil and pernicious ideas ever promulgated by an American judge.  It is based upon the premise that there can&rsquo;t be any significant average differences among races, which is like basing a navigation system upon the assumption that the Earth is flat.  Any relevant standards will have &#8220;disparate&#8221;, whether for admission to a school, promotion in a job, or qualification for a mortgage.  It is simply a fact, for example, that on average a black person with the same income as a white person is less likely to pay back a loan in full.  By forbidding &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; the government is setting the banks up for another mortgage crisis.</p>

		<p>Federal taxes have a disparate impact on White Americans, as do these Justice Department lawsuits.  Both of which target and negatively impact Whites in far greater numbers than non-Whites.  Perhaps the Justice Dept&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division can look into this.  Then again, I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.  This (White) taxpayer funded department of the federal government has their orders, and that is to disproportionately go after Whites while giving others a pass.  Apparently &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; is okay as long as Whites are on the receiving end.</p>

		<p>Reading this I realize that we need to get this bum out in Nov 2012 even if we get a watered down Republican. Too much is at stake. Especially if there is another Supreme Court opening or two. It is definitely not a good thing to support a Palin or I don&rsquo;t know a Huckabee, but at least we wouldn&rsquo;t have as much dirt thrown on our graves.  </p>

		<p>If you want to find out who is responsible for what&rsquo;s happening in the world then follow the money trail. </p>
<p>We have been throwing money at minorities for the last 50 years and they are just a poor as ever so just who does have the money that we have been throwing away? </p>
<p>Imagine that you own a slum that you need to rent or some poor condition houses that you wish to sell at a huge profit. The people that you wish to con don&rsquo;t have the money to be conned  so you force the white tax payers to give them the money. Once they have the money it doesn&rsquo;t stay with them for very long because it&rsquo;s like taking candy from a baby. </p>
<p>The money that tax payers throw at minorities ends up in the pockets of the rich just as they planned all along. </p>

<p>Yes, and I believe we Whites are at a turning point right here and right now. </p>
<p>The Justice Department has declared War on us Whites.  It actively, brazenly, works against White interests by not defending our Civil Rights and filing charges against us when we try to defend our homelands from Third World invaders.</p>
<p>The DOJ is an enemy of Whites and should be viewed by Whites as such-along with the msm and K-12 government schools.</p>
<p>If things aren&rsquo;t turned around with the next election, The DOJ will step up its efforts to dispossess us Whites of any remaining rights  &mdash;  the media will continue to dehumanize us to low IQ blacks, hispanics and other non-Whites, setting us up for genocide at their hands as our numbers decrease.</p>
<p>As the economy continues to deteriorate, with no end in sight, the dollar continues to lose value, unemployment continues to rise, and the government has its boot on our White necks, I see nothing but a very bad outcome for the future of the White Race. </p>
<p>If you believe I&rsquo;m wrong, if you think this is not our White future, provide proof.</p>

(How come Teddy Boy, relatively young at the time, wasn&rsquo;t called up to Vietnam as part of the Army Reserve, which he was part of?)</p>
<p>I hate to defend Ted Kennedy, may he rot in hell, but he did serve active duty in 1951.  He pulled a tour in dangerous (sic) Paris as a member of the Honor Guard for the NATO command center.  This was during the Korean War.  By the time Viet Nam rolled around he would have been in his mid 30s.  Yes, he was a REMF, but he did spend more time in uniform than most of the other chickenhawks.  <br>
This doesn&rsquo;t make up for the destruction he brought to this nation.  But if we are going to attack a man, we should at least have the facts correct.</p>
