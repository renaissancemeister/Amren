<h1>The Evolution of Language in Diversity Management</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Raymond Arroyo, Diversity, Inc., September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Diversity management has come a long way since I joined in the early 1990s. Scores of books have been published on this business strategy. Hundreds of consultants earn their living by specializing in diversity management, and thousands of provocative articles have been published by a range of organizations on this topic. There are also diversity-management courses and certificate programs available at many universities. Some even offer a master&rsquo;s degree. Today, most major corporations have chief diversity officers (CDOs), some of whom report directly to their CEOs. In addition to focusing on racial/ethnic and gender diversity, many CDOs have added other, less-visible diversity dimensions such as sexual orientation/identity and religion, to name only two.</p>
<p>In the past few years, several in the field have also added &#8220;inclusion&#8221; to their diversity strategies (and titles) as a visible symbol that these strategies aren&rsquo;t just about diversifying the work force: They are about having systems and processes that are fully inclusive, where all stakeholders&rsquo; contributions are sought, valued and measured. Furthermore, an increasing number of organizations have expanded their diversity scope to encompass global markets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Precise Communication Needed</b></p>
<p>Despite significant progress, the language used today to communicate diversity has not evolved with the broader focus. Almost daily, I read or hear references to an individual being &#8220;diverse&#8221; or someone being a &#8220;diversity candidate.&#8221; If our diversity initiatives include multiple dimensions and are fully inclusive, those descriptions are too narrow.</p>
<p>In addition, many organizations still have &#8220;diversity recruiting&#8221; departments. But they don&rsquo;t advance diversity to its full potential. Often, recruiting departments focus on recruiting underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. {snip}</p>
<p>Diversity is about understanding and leveraging the diverse triggers that motivate different groups to create increased value for employees and their companies. It is about understanding the intrinsic value that a diverse set of individuals bring to our organizations so everyone is included. {snip}</p>
<p>If language is to catch up with today&rsquo;s broader focus of diversity, we should use terms that are clear and precise. The term &#8220;traditionally underrepresented minority&#8221; (TUM) can be used when referring to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans. An alternative for people who object to &#8220;minority&#8221; or &#8220;people of color&#8221; is the acronym formed from the groups above  &mdash;  ALANA, used by some in higher education. Another appropriate term, which is broader in scope, is &#8220;traditionally underrepresented group&#8221; (TUG). TUG includes ethnic/racial groups, women, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender people, individuals with disabilities and veterans. Many organizations&rsquo; diversity efforts are focused on TUG.</p>
<p>To capture the broader and fully inclusive meaning of diversity that does not exist today, you can use a phrase created by marketing consultant Ernie Mills, which is &#8220;Person with Intrinsic Cultural Knowledge,&#8221; or PICK. This term communicates that someone&rsquo;s cultural knowledge and understanding creates value for his or her company, whether those aspects of self are visible or invisible.</p>
<p>For example, since Mills is a U.S. Navy and Army National Guard veteran, he&rsquo;s in a position to help companies build government business by sharing insights into how military families live and think. As a Latino, I may intrinsically bring an understanding of the ways that many Latinos live in the country, and thus help to shape company policy effectively. The same could be said of a Chinese person who, due to specific cultural insights, might be able to identify stumbling blocks to potential sales by illuminating how family elders influence decisions. The same holds true for individuals who are Generation Y or X, LGBT people or those with deeply held religious beliefs. PICK gets to the core value  &mdash;  diversity monetized by population segment.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Like all business leaders who strive to explain important concepts clearly, those of us who manage diversity must communicate in precise language  &mdash;  and educate others. Our level of precision may mark the difference between making sustainable progress or overseeing initiatives that lack traction. Language can support or hinder a company&rsquo;s diversity strategy and, therefore, needs to evolve to remain relevant and garner organizational support.</p>

		<p>What does this guy produce for the economy?  Does he increase business efficiency or sales?  Are products and services made cheaper, faster, or better via his work?  Do his actions reduce our Nation&rsquo;s trade defict or help to lower taxes?</p>
<p>Or is he a parasite on business, academia, government, and society   &mdash;   lowering efficiency, clogging industry and sucking up resources that could be used to improve our Nation&rsquo;s economy? </p>
<p>At this sad point in our Nation&rsquo;s slow decline, every business, governmental agency, and University maintains an expensive &#8220;Office of Minority Affairs,&#8221; or similar organization by a different name.  Literally billions of Dollars are sucked out of our economy annually by these people so that they can further waste your time and money by their endless meetings, surveys, demands, symposiums, booklets, and interference.   <br>

		<p>This is about hiring non-whites for &#8220;the intrinsic value that a diverse set of individuals bring&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a throwback to the medieval practice of arranged marriages between royal families and between clans.  </p>
<p>When a patriarch married off his daughter in an arranged wedding to outsiders, he did so for strategic gain.</p>
<p>These marriages of convenience between white employers and non-whites will in practice have the same inherent hazards as Rome hiring barbarians to serve its empire.  </p>

		<p>Funny, I have worked in the corporate world all these years, and lately I haven&rsquo;t really heard anything at all about &#8220;diversity&#8221; as a &#8220;strategy&#8221;.  It was all the rage in years past, but now Instead of tricky acronyms like ALANA and TUG, why not just use &#8220;accurate language&#8221;, as the author desires, and say &#8220;non-white&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Now let me get this straight (no pun intended):  Japan is able to sell products SUCCESSFULLY in America (diverse), Europe (white), Africa (black), South America (latino, India (Indian), the Middle East (Muslim Arab) and the Philipines (mishmosh) because they flooded Japan with WASPS, Mexicans, Bantus, Hindis, Egyptians and Filipinos?  No, wait, that isn&rsquo;t it!  They made products that were well made and desired!  And all without Mr. Arroyo&rsquo;s insightful and meaningful guidance.  How in heaven&rsquo;s name?</p>

<p>The article spouts a lot of pompous, academic babble. The usual jargon to impress and make you think he&rsquo;s an expert.  But what does he actually SAY?</p>
<p>As poster #1, put it so well, <br>
 <i> &#8220;What does this guy produce? Does he increase efficiency or sales? Or is he a parasite&hellip;? </i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say &#8220;a parasite&#8221;!  A pompous, wordy parasite.</p>

How would an employer necessarily know what life experience or knowledge I have in my personal background, without extensive probing? I do not want any employer digging into my religious beliefs, my sexual tastes, my hobbies, my interests, or my political views. So how would they know?  Will we be filling out forms, as a condition of employment?</p>
<p>None of this is (or should be) any of their business! A job should be just a job&hellip; they don&rsquo;t own you! You&rsquo;re an employee, not a serf. </p>
<p>Where this could lead is scary.</p>

		<p>Diversity officers add nothing to productivity; they just add overhead costs to the company&rsquo;s product and make it less competitive.  How can American companies compete against Chinese companies where the brass, middle-management, and line workers are all Chinese? Chinese will always trump diversity.</p>

		<p>We need to review an excerpt from Orwell&rsquo;s 1946 essay, &#8220;Politics and the English Language&#8221; (http://tinyurl.com/yets):</p>
<p>&#8220;In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism., question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, &#8220;I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.&#8221; Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The inflated style itself is a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one&rsquo;s real and one&rsquo;s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as &#8220;keeping out of politics.&#8221; All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>And now we have Mr. Arroyo posing as the champion of clear language (!) who can&rsquo;t come right out and say, &#8220;Hire every race but White, and every sex but straight, and shun White men above all&#8221;; rather he must babble polysyllabically about establishing market traction by leveraging truly inclusive diversity initiatives.<br>

		<p>In a typical Chinese company you have 2 managers, 1 Political overseer, and 97 workers.  </p>
<p>In America, you have 10 managers, 3 Diversity Workers/Consultants, 3 Union stewards, and 3 accountants/bureaucrats to oversee Federal-mandated paperwork and regulations, and 81 workers.  </p>
<p>Guess which system produces more at a lower cost? Guess which system has more flexibility and can move more quickly to meet the changing needs of the marketplace?  But let&rsquo;s not worry about that   &mdash;   instead, let&rsquo;s shut down production for 2 hrs to have yet another company-wide Diversity Meeting. </p>
<p>By the way, China is now eliminating Political Overseers in industry and schools, in order to increase efficiency.</p>

		<p>America&rsquo;s greatest growth was before all this pablum became fashionable and became required for nonprofit, govt and corporate entities. Since we&rsquo;ve become so inclusive and paid consultants and corporate bureaucrats big bucks to focus on the right accent, skin color and sexual position, our dollar has fallen, our manufacturing capacity dwindled, and millions are unemployed or underemplyed. </p>
<p>Even the vaunted four year degree hasn&rsquo;t saved millions from joblessness or working somewhere that really doesn&rsquo;t need a degree. And now, the coup de grace. Educaton Nation. NBC&rsquo;s touting of the ruling class&rsquo; decision to eliminate local and private schools. Get those blacks and hispanics out of high school no matter what kind of group-based feel-good techniques plus rote tests will do the trick. </p>
<p>Individual thinking, elevation of the talented over the less talented, and training of the majority of students to do the jobs Goldman Sachs &amp; Co shipped to China years ago are not on the agenda of the media elite, Hussein Obama and the globalization crowd. </p>
<p>Diversity=Mediocrity=National Suicide. That&rsquo;s the New Math.</p>

		<p>Ask a leftist for a definition of &#8220;fascism&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll get something along the lines of &#8220;corporate control of the government.&#8221;  But it doesn&rsquo;t take much rubbing together of the brain cells to realize that it was Hitler who called the shots in Nazi Germany, not the Krupp family or any of the other powerful industrialists or financiers.  </p>
<p>The fatal error of every leftist is they don&rsquo;t realize that business can&rsquo;t reach the power it has in America without government inviting it in, because they view government as a benevolent savior that seeks to do only good for its people, as opposed to exploitive corporations that want to rape and pillage and worship only the almighty dollar.  No mention though of the fact that both are made up of men, who are fallible and do commit sin and often transit seamlessly between business and government, depending on which party is in or out of power at a given time.</p>
<p>What you just read here in this self-congratulatory piece of drivel by Comrade Arroyo, this is fascism.  Fascism is a blurring of the lines between government and business, a collusion between the two, so to speak.  Fascism is the CEO of General Electric coming into the White House to discuss strategy with Obama.  Fascism is the official government policy of &#8220;diversity&#8221; getting its tentacles in the board rooms of corporations at such a high level that many have vice-presidential level positions just for the diversity team.  Business is not greater than government in America.  Business equals government in America.  That&rsquo;s fascism. </p>
<p>Brainwashed Marxists would have you believe that fascism is the exclusive province of the right, blissfully ignorant of the fact that Hitler was a health food nut, discouraged smoking, elevated some races above others, and created the first national parks in Europe were created in Nazi Germany.  Now who in contemporary America champions healthy eating, anti-smoking crusades, racial privilege, and the federal government taking over an ever larger share of American land to &#8220;protect for posterity&#8221;? </p>

		<p>This is a minor point, but I object to the use of the term Native American to describe American Indians. The term &#8220;Native&#8221; basically means that a person is born in this country. (I&rsquo;d like to redefine it as a person born to a citizen of this country, but that&rsquo;s another issue.) People who use the term Native Americans do so, I think, because they inherently object to Whites doling out names for other ethnicities or races and because they have mistakenly used the term &#8220;native&#8221; instead of &#8220;aboriginal&#8221;. &#8220;Aboriginal&#8221; means those belonging to the first group to inhabit an area. </p>

		<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s greatest growth was before all this pablum became fashionable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in the 1950&rsquo;s when America was shamefully 90% White, we sold our products to every nation on earth, we enjoyed a favorable balance of trade, we had nearly full employment and a high standard of living, the best educational system in the world, and low crime and taxes.  </p>
<p>Now that we have embraced Diversity and Multiculturalism (supposedly because it will benefit us in a global marketplace),and Whites are reduced to 55% of the population, no one buys our products, our factories are shut down, everything we buy is made overseas, we have a gigantic trade deficit, crime and unemployment are up, and education and standard of living are down.   Yet, unbelievably, the Left is still claiming that multiculturalism is good for America!  </p>

		<p>Poster # 8 really gets to the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>Liberal diversocrats think that the only way a company will be able to sell a product to racial group X,Y or Z is IF there is a member of that racial group on staff who has some mystical knowledge that will give the company an edge.</p>
<p>But this is saying that people of different races CANNOT understand each other or reason with each other at all, and thus you need someone who can help them understand what you want to sell them.  This is of course complete rubbish.</p>
<p>It also assumes that each racial and cultural group in this country will live separately and not blend together and assimilate.  So the chinese will stay chinese in culture even though they live in america for generations, the latinos likewise, etc.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this, ahem, a recipe for disaster?  No unitary state has every survived for long if it was so multicultural that there was no center to sustain the nation.  The Romans only survived because they had an iron fist.  </p>
<p>When the Fed is reduced to squabbling racial fiefdoms, what do you think will happen to the &#8220;united&#8221; states then?  What reason would they have to stick together if New Mexico is another race and culture entirely from Vermont?</p>

<p>These are Professor Rummel&rsquo;s estimates.  He has spent his professional life studying and researching the numbers published in his book, Death by Government and welcomes any/all challenges.  He writes that some believe his numbers to be too low and over the years he has revised several of them  &mdash;  upwards.</p>
<p>61,911,000 Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State <br>
35,236,000 Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill <br>
20,946,000 Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State <br>
10,214,000 Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime</p>
<p><br>
5,964,000 Murdered: Japan&rsquo;s Savage Military <br>
2,035,000 Murdered: The Khmer Rouge Hell State <br>
1,883,000 Murdered: Turkey&rsquo;s Genocidal Purges <br>
1,670,000 Murdered: The Vietnamese War State <br>
1,585,000 Murdered: Poland&rsquo;s Ethnic Cleansing <br>
1,503,000 Murdered: The Pakistani Cutthroat State <br>
1,072,000 Murdered: Tito&rsquo;s Slaughterhouse</p>

<i> This is a minor point, but I object to the use of the term Native American to describe American Indians.

<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right, and I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. I have been fighting against that misnomer for some years now - without any success.  Any person who is merely born here is a &#8220;native&#8221; of the place. (Even an illegal alien, I regret to say.) The word simply refers to place of birth, nothing more.  </p>
<p>However, I don&rsquo;t think use of the term &#8220;native&#8221; is &#8220;mistakenly used&#8221;, but is quite deliberate. It&rsquo;s a clever device of the anti-white  Left to imply that the Amerindians are the proper possessors of the land, its true and legitimate inhabitants, and to imply that whites are intruders in a place where we don&rsquo;t belong. It&rsquo;s a way of discrediting our legitimacy in our own country.</p>
<p>But down through human history, land has changed hands many times among tribes, nations, races. This is even true with packs of animals who fight over territory   &mdash;   just as the Indian tribes fought incessantly among themselves and took land from each other.  The land belongs to whoever can possess it and hold it. There is no natural and guaranteed &#8220;owner&#8221; of the land.  </p>
<p>We won this land through war, through negotiation, and through purchase. And then we built this successful country called the USA upon it.  We have graciously permitted the vanguished to remain, and we have even invited them to participate! </p>
<p>It is ours now.  We are not interlopers. But unless we wake up and get off our laurels, it may not remain ours for long. The hungry billions of the Third World are eyeing our rich country enviously.</p>

&#8220;How would an employer necessarily know what life experience or knowledge I have in my personal background, without extensive probing? I do not want any employer digging into my religious beliefs, my sexual tastes, my hobbies, my interests, or my political views. So how would they know? Will we be filling out forms, as a condition of employment?</p>
<p>None of this is (or should be) any of their business! A job should be just a job&hellip; they don&rsquo;t own you! You&rsquo;re an employee, not a serf.</p>
<p>Where this could lead is scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not agree with you more!  All anyone has to do is show up for work, do a good job, and be professional and polite with all their co-workers.  I think all of us ought to be outraged that we are not thought capable of doing this on our own accord.  I really, really do not want my employer to know all that much about me.  My friends, my thoughts, my political views, what I do in my bedroom is none of my employer&rsquo;s business!  </p>
<p>All my employer needs to know is my education and work experience. PERIOD.  I am getting really sick of being treated like a child who needs to be babysat by my employer.  I am a full-grown adult with my own principles and beliefs.  I go to work to earn a paycheck, not to get a lecture in morality.    </p>

Precise language? This is the biggest bunch of nonsense and obfuscation I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Also one of the funniest.</p>

		<p>if they are truly rethinking the term &#8220;diversity&#8221; this is an indication of push-back.  look at the new term TUG &#8220;Traditionally Underrepresented Group&#8221; - if I have 99 non-whites and 1 white working in my company (no, this is not the start of a joke) I have 99 TUGs and 1 TOG.  This applies &#8220;minority status&#8221; and all the bells and whistles to any &#8220;TUG&#8221; regardless of how they are represented in the company, the industry or the population in general.  The TOG by definition will never be &#8220;underrepresented&#8221;.</p>
<p>Time to ratchet up the awareness to diversity training.</p>

		<p>Did anyone else want to throw up well reading this drain on productive societies essay?  The word diversity blurred together so much I couldn&rsquo;t even finish this jem. My step mum works for a pretty big company in Edmonton as a human resources and her company decieded to stop hiring minorities, unofficially of course. They did this because they got tired of getting human rights complaint every time they fired a minority</p>

		<p>20 ChemE &amp; 25 Browser: Absolutely.  The term &#8220;Native American&#8221; as a synonym for Indian was solely intended to deny the legitimacy of White existence in America.  In Canada they now say &#8220;First Nations&#8221;, making Whites the &#8220;second nation&#8221;.  Of course, the reality is that Whites are a &#8220;third nation&#8221;, behind all the diverse newcomers.  </p>
