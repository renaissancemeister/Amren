<h1>Black Farmers Call on U.S. Senate to Fund Settlement</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The head of the National Black Farmers Association renewed his call Tuesday for Congress to fund a historic discrimination case settlement involving minority farmers.</p>
<p>He slammed the sharply divided Senate for repeatedly stripping funding provisions from different bills, and urged President Obama to call for a decisive vote on the measure by the end of September.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd said black farmers are losing land at a rate three times faster than other agricultural workers. He said that it takes nearly 400 days to process a black farmer&rsquo;s loan request at the Agriculture Department, compared with less than 30 days for white farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress has money for everything  &mdash;  to bail out banks, Wall Street, AIG, everybody,&#8221; he said. But &#8220;we can&rsquo;t seem to get this done. There is something terribly wrong with that picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. Senate failed to approve $1.25 billion for the settlement between the U.S. Agriculture Department and black farmers, prompting finger-pointing by members of both parties and outrage among many black farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very, very, very disappointed that we are just caught up in such a larger political fight in the Senate, where it&rsquo;s just partisan division,&#8221; Boyd said after the August 5 outcome.</p>
<p>A 1997 case against the Agriculture Department, Pigford v. Glickman, was settled out of court 11 years ago, but tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Now THAT is funny.  Racial identity politics is used to steal money from the government but the actual &#8220;victims&#8221; that allow themselves to be used in this huge lie actually get stiffed for their slice of the loot.</p>

		<p>In case you&rsquo;re interested the National Black Farmers Association has a website. I checked it out. There&rsquo;s basically nothing about farming. The poorly designed and dated site is devoted to lawsuits, cries of racial discrimination, and endless demands for money and credits.</p>
<p>Below is an excerpt from the website detailing the organization&rsquo;s history and mission. You won&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>=========================================================<br>
https://www.blackfarmers.org/index.htm</p>
<p>HISTORY<br>
The National Black Farmers Association Incorporated is a non-profit, community organization founded in February of 1995, by John Boyd, Jr., of Baskerville, Virginia, a third generation farmer who is determined to hold on to his heritage, and to save his farm from foreclosure caused by racial discrimination under the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT<br>
To encourage the participation of small and disadvantaged farmers in gaining access to resources of state and federal programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture&hellip;<br>
=============================================================</p>
<p>Maybe if they actually paid attention to farming, or knew how to run a farm in the first place, this extortion would not be necessary.</p>

		<p>That headline is a real teaser. For a moment I thought that &#8220;settlement&#8221; referred to a place where all of the Blacks were going to settle. My knee jerk reaction was, forget the senate, I&rsquo;ll get everybody I know to clean out their bank accounts tomorrow and donate all of it to the cause.</p>

		<p>This is strange.  I&rsquo;ve hunted farms all over the East and much of the South (with permission) and have never encountered a black farmer. Admittedly, I&rsquo;ve never hunted in Mississippi or Louisiana, where there may be a few, but black agricultural land-owners seem to be relatively rare.  I suspect that the term &#8220;farmer&#8221; may be getting some definitional stretch in this instance.</p>

		<p>For some reason I&rsquo;m picturing a scam where many of the African American farmers are inner city con artist with a few tomato plants and cucumbers growing in the back yard asking for a loan of about one hundred thousand dollars.I wonder when big Al,Jessie, the NAACP and the rest of the race hucksters are going to join in for their share of the tribute and booty?</p>

		<p>Just throwing out an idea here, perhaps the reason white farmers get the loan applications processed faster is because they usually have substantial land? When it comes down to it, would you be quicker to help the farmer with 4000 acres or with 200 acres? You go with the one that would benefit more.  And I have to wonder, how many black farmers are there? I live in the midwest and other than African immigrants I hardly even see any black people!</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;Congress has money for everything&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Typically black failure of comprehension.  It isn&rsquo;t <i>congress&gt;</i> that has money for everything, it&rsquo;s <i>Whitey</i>.  That&rsquo;s <i>our</i> money that congress throws away right and left.  And Whitey is getting sick and tired of having our pockets picked every time some whiney nonWhite brays &#8220;gimme.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;He said that it takes nearly 400 days to process a black farmer&rsquo;s loan request at the Agriculture Department, compared with less than 30 days for white farmers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Given the amerikan government&rsquo;s notorious afrophilia, I find that extremely hard to believe.  Would it be Racist to demand proof of this assertion?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Even assuming that there actually <i>are</i> &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of black farmers, isn&rsquo;t that their own fault?  First they&rsquo;re offered yet another free handout and now they&rsquo;re whining because they failed to take it?<br>

<p>30 days for Whites, 400 for blacks. I think this has a simple explanation.</p>
<p>White people fill out the forms properly the first time, include all necessary documentation, and meet the deadlines.</p>

		<p>From what I understand there were probably fewer than 10,000 black &#8220;farms&#8221; when all the &#8220;discrimination&#8221; took place. But now there are over 90,000 claims. I&rsquo;ll bet Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and all the other civil rights racketeers have overalls they can wear to any protests.</p>
<p>Are there any black farmers? Growing up in Alabama I can remember a few, but they were mostly subsistence operations that feed themselves and their families and produced a little cotton as a cash crop. But most of them planted their acreage in pine trees or sold out when food stamps became available. In other words they supported themselves until they learned to be dependent.</p>
