<h1>Mexico Lashes Out at US After Migrant Massacre</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Las Vegas Sun, September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador said Friday he doesn&rsquo;t blame Mexico&rsquo;s government for the massacre of 72 mainly Central American migrants, and called for a joint effort to fight drug cartels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thirteen Salvadorans were among the dead identified so far in the massacre in late August, a killing blamed on one of Mexico&rsquo;s drug cartels, the Zetas.</p>
<p>In a separate interview Friday, Calderon said the migrant massacre doesn&rsquo;t undermine Mexico&rsquo;s moral authority to demand better treatment for its own migrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we have the moral authority, because Mexican officials are not shooting Central American youths at the border, but U.S. agents are shooting Mexican migrants,&#8221; Calderon said in an interview with the Spanish-language Univision network.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are talking about responsibility, at the root of this, in the case of immigration, is the lack of immigration legislation in the United States that would recognize this phenomenon,&#8221; Calderon said.</p>
<p>Funes, however, said during his joint appearance with Calderon that the home nations of migrants bear some of the responsibility for immigration problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;In part, the greatest responsibility lies with our governments, the Salvadoran government, for not having generated the employment conditions, the welfare conditions, that doesn&rsquo;t leave our migrants any choice but to look for other opportunities in the United States and Canada.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Umm, I&rsquo;m not quite getting this.  We&rsquo;re responsible because Mexican drug dealers are shooting Central Americans and Mexicans in Mexico?  I can&rsquo;t make the connection, unless, of course, that the US is the presumptive guilty party in any misfortune involving non-American Hispanics.</p>
<p>I suppose we&rsquo;ll be responsible in the event of earthquakes, violent weather, or volcanic eruptions.</p>

		<p>Right! I know someone was going to say this. That the USA is to blame for Mexican gangsters perpetrating atrocities.</p>
<p>If ONLY we would let everyone in, then no need for illegality. Change YOUR laws and favor the law breaker and then no more massacre.</p>
<p>WE in the USA are to blame for what the Mex criminal does. Sure!!</p>
<p>This calls for a diplomatic demarche or whatever they call it. A formal complaint to the Mex ambassador. But that will not happen. How hopeless the situation.</p>

		<p>this article stated the truth. Central America and Mexico are responsible for their citizens leaving their countries to go north. They do not provide any form of opportunity for their own people. The US and Canada are not obligated to accept migrants from south of the border because their own governments are not doing what they are supposed to do.</p>

		<p>The entire concept generated by Mexico and the Central American nations is that, because we in El Norte have been prosperous over the last 2 centuries, we owe a portion of it to them. What distorted logic makes them believe that? We owe them nada, nothing! </p>
<p>Due to the distorted generosity of the plutocracy that runs the U.S. we are witnessing the destruction of the assets and the savings of the middle class. But that&rsquo;s not enough! The oligarchs that run the show in Latin America are also of a mindset that middle class America somehow owes a living to its people! As a middle class white U.S. citizen there is little that I can do to stop this. Voting is to no avail. Whoever gets in completely turns on the electorate. I can&rsquo;t patrol the borders! But I can at least not visit any of these nations. They want my tourist dollars. There will be no chance of that! I can at least boycott these nations and not spend my vacation dollars there. I can try not to buy their goods as well. That&rsquo;s a harder trick! Don&rsquo;t vacation there. Cutting dollars off from them is a powerful weapon - and one of the few that a middle class white citizen of the U.S. has!<br>

		<p>The only immigrants that ever get shot at by the border patrol are those who first shoot at or threaten to shoot at the border patrol.  So Calderon is now saying we have a moral responsibility to welcome Mexico&rsquo;s criminals.  This is the guy the Democrats applauded when he spoke before Congress.<br>

<p>The US isn&rsquo;t shooting Mexican migrants, only those who have fired at police and Mexicans have fired or thrown rocks at our border patrol. Mexico doesn&rsquo;t have the moral authority on anything, they don&rsquo;t allow illegal migration, treat illegal migrants caught like dirt and have a dismal human rights record.</p>

<p>Canada is a signatory to the &#8216;Third Party Refugee Agreement&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>If the Salvadorans pass through the United States (a safe Third country) without making a refugee claim, they can be denied refugee status by Canada.</p>
<p>If Canada is a target of illegal migration from the south, Canada should participate in monitoring of the southern United States border. Canada and the U.S. share joint defensive roles in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which monitors air and water approaches to North America. </p>
<p>Canada, within its standing NORAD agreements, should actively participate in defense of the U.S. southern border.   </p>

		<p>If you want to have a clear example for not only diversity weakens a society but much more liberals do, the perfect example is Mexiko.</p>
<p>Nobody 100 years ago could ever think of why such a poor, weak and bad country like Mexico could play with the Super Power of the World and cause so many Problems.<br>
We have on the one side Mexico a poor, land and on the other side the Super Power of the world. And Mexico is invading and conquering the Super Power because liberals have weakened it so much.<br>
Yes liberalism is a disease, a illness like AIDS causing the country can not defend itself anymore.</p>

		<p>So 72 Central American immigrants were killed in Mexico by local gangsters and it&rsquo;s all America&rsquo;s fault: after all, if we had open-borders the drug thugs would be living in the US and would not have been able to commit this massacre!</p>

		<p>This is one of the most outrageously mendacious statements I&rsquo;ve ever read.<br>
Le&rsquo;s see - Barabric Mexican criminals cold-bloodely murder their mestizo brothers from south of the border - over some trifling incident - and somehow it is spun that White Americans are responsible, somehow Whites managed to possess the murderers by remote control, impant thoughts into their heads and cause them to slaughter their co-ethnics.<br>
 That&rsquo;s in effect what is claimed.<br>
&#8216;Logic&rsquo; that an honest 5 year old child would reject.&rsquo;Logic&rsquo; that would disgrace the most primitive tribesman.</p>

		<p>The fantasy world that Mexicans and many south of the border inhabitants dwell in, grows more bizarre each day. Whatever evil befalls them, they point north. US is to blame for everything no matter where it happens. But where do Mexicans bring their criminal ways? Good old USA. Santa Claus to the world. We&rsquo;d very much appreciate you doing your complaining in your own miserable countries. Gracias!</p>

		<p>If according to this arrogant dork Funes, the United States must take the blame for Mexican criminals killing Central American criminal invaders, I see no other option but to man-up and take full responsibility for these killings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my fault.  Yes; that&rsquo;s right; we&rsquo;re living in an age when politically-connected blowhards can blame anyone for any thing, so these killings are all my fault .  Not only that, but I&rsquo;m not one bit sorry, and I&rsquo;m afraid these killings will continue due to my wicked unwillingness to stop them.  So there.</p>

<p>Right, even if they are throwing a brick at your vehicle with the intent to harm you, that is still not grounds to use lethal force to defend yourself. These Border Patrol agents have to really be in a super bad situation before they use their firearms. They are NOT using them in an indiscriminant manner at all. Hardly.</p>

		<p>the United States has been mucking around in El Salvador for century, and has done a lot of damage there.</p>
<p>as for Mexico, the United States is partly at fault for the chaos there:</p>
<p>all of those stupid globalizing trade agreements passed by the Clinton administration allowed US agribusinesses to dump their cheap commodities on Mexico, thereby driving hundreds of thousands of subsistence farmers off the land and into the already bloated cities.</p>
<p>a good deal for both countries would be the following:</p>
<p>a TALL border fence for us, and deportation of all illegals, with Mexico&rsquo;s full cooperation.</p>
<p>they would get:<br>
more US military assistance in crushing the cartels, strong protectionist measures to keep out American agricultural products, strong environmental and labor laws for US businesses operating in Mexico.</p>
<p>globalization has been a catastrophe on every level, and mass Third World immigration into the first world is only one aspect of it.</p>
