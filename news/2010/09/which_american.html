			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Razib Khan, Discover, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} I&rsquo;ve probed the international differences in total fertility rates before, but what about in the United States? You probably won&rsquo;t be surprised which segment of the population has the highest fertility, but what about the lowest? {snip} So according to the Census Bureau the TFR&rsquo;s in 2008 were:</p>
<p>2.09  &mdash;  All races<br>
1.84  &mdash;  Non-Hispanic white<br>
2.11  &mdash;  Non-Hispanic black<br>
1.84  &mdash;  American Indian, Native Alaskan<br>
2.06  &mdash;  Asian &amp; Pacific Islander<br>
2.99  &mdash;  Hispanic</p>
<p>Yes, Native Americans have the same TFR as non-Hispanic whites! Total surprise to me. The profile in relation to within wedlock and out-of-wedlock differs between the groups a fair amount. Here are the percents born to unmarried mothers:</p>
<p>40.6%  &mdash;  All races<br>
28.6%  &mdash;  Non-Hispanic white<br>
72.3%  &mdash;  Non-Hispanic black<br>
65.8%  &mdash;  American Indian, Native Alaskan<br>
16.9%  &mdash;  Asian &amp; Pacific Islander<br>
52.5%  &mdash;  Hispanic</p>
<p>So Native Americans combine low total fertility with a high proportion of out-of-wedlock births. I actually found births per 1,000 trend lines broken down by Hispanic ethnic group. There&rsquo;s an interesting pattern [below].</p>
<p>As you can see, the &#8220;high Hispanic fertility rate&#8221; is really the high Mexican American fertility rate. Cuban Americans have fertility below non-Hispanic whites (Cuba&rsquo;s TFR is 1.6, though Cuban Americans are highly unrepresentative of Cuba demographically and culturally somewhat isolated from the island), and Puerto Ricans seem to track black Americans. The latter aligns with the sociology I&rsquo;ve seen that indicates American Puerto Ricans share many norms and vital stats with the blacks next to whom they settled in Manhattan (Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico have a TFR which is the same as non-Hispanic whites). Interestingly, the Native and non-Hispanic white fertility has only converged in the last generation or so. One issue to consider is that there&rsquo;s been a large increase in the number of Americans identifying as Native American since the 1980s, so this may have altered the fertility simply because of a change in the demographic composition of those who identify as Native American. Another point is that Mexican Americans have a TFR which is much higher than in Mexico, which is now around ~2 (though if you look up the data, you&rsquo;ll see some underdeveloped southern Mexican states are around ~3).</p>

		<p>No doubt a huge number of one-eighth Amerindian (or whatever small fraction) mostly-white liberals reported themselves as Amerindian to the government, and thereby artificially depressed their chosen race&rsquo;s birth rate. The irony drips.</p>

		<p>Wow, a media report that does not hide statistics on Asians.  I think statistics on Asians should be broken down into smaller categories since Asia is the largest continent and has different racial groups located there.  East, South, and Central Asian and Middle Eastern should be the categories.  Asian birth rates are going up.  You can&rsquo;t take that breeding gene out of them, the one that created Beijing, New Delhi, Manila, Tokyo, Soeul, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Mumbai, Shangai and the list unfortunately goes on.  </p>
<p>Mexicans clearly are having a lot of children to tie themselves to this country by making it harder for the immigration system to deport them and because of all the entitlement programs.</p>

		<p> While lamenting the low total fertility rate for American Whites overall, one should remember that White birth rates in the New England states (abysmally low) drag the overall average down. In Utah, on the other hand, the White TFR is in the neighborhood of 2.6 (largely due to the Mormons&rsquo; propensity for large families), and it is higher than the national average in Arizona, Idaho, and other states in the Mountain States.</p>
<p> A noted political column from late 2004 showed that the 26 or so states carried by George W. Bush in that year&rsquo;s election had significantly higher White TFRs than those of the states that voted for John Kerry. Hence, the low TFR for non-Hispanic Whites is a long way from universal. Besides, the Amish and the Orthodox Jews, almost entirely Caucasian groups, also have significantly higher TFRs. All is not lost, AmReners!</p>

		<p>Yes, BlueBlood, I&rsquo;d like to see the &#8216;Asian&rsquo; and &#8216;Asian-American&rsquo; groups identified separately, too.</p>
<p>The last I heard, Japanese-Americans have the highest rate of high school completion and the lowest rate of imprisonment. They are also among the least fecund of Americans and over half of the Japanese-American women getting married are marrying outside the Japanese-American tribe.</p>
<p>Population and fecundity projections and extrapolations are simply hifalutin guesswork because we have no real idea of how today&rsquo;s 5-year-olds will behave two decades from now. At the time the Shah was overthrown, Iranian women were having lots of babies, six or seven or more. Now - thirty years later - a new generation is down to European reproduction levels and college-educated Iranian women in cities are having babies below the standard reproduction rate of 22 babies for every 10 women.</p>
<p>As for Indians, thanks to widespread contraception and incessant birth-control propaganda, the educated middle classes of Mumbai - like those of Shanghai - are certainly not going to overwhelm the planet with their offspring; they&rsquo;re down to European levels already.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that those having most babies are those whom we least want to breed. Which brings us to the dreaded word &#8216;eugenics&rsquo; and all that it implies.</p>
<p>As for me, I had a vasectomy after my second child was born.</p>

		<p>Everywhere in the world birth rates are declining.  This is because most people, and certainly most women, would rather raise one or a few children well than many poorly.  It is also good for our over populated planet.<br>
 <br>
I do not fear for the future of the white and Oriental races.  The future belongs to those with intelligence and education.  </p>

		<p>The things which aren&rsquo;t being shown are the time:resource scaling issues.</p>
<p>If a white society needs white surroundings to teach it&rsquo;s kids the benefits of our folkway and a flood of other ethnies degrades or alters that &#8216;this is the message, do you get it?&rsquo; implicit understanding, change can occur as a function of ours joining theirs as much as by outright extinction.</p>
<p>And -culturally- that kind of extinction is harder to bring back because there isn&rsquo;t the easy identification of group.</p>
<p>Also, I read somewhere that the majority of Hispanic births in California, some ridiculously high number like .72 are teen-driven before highschool graduation.</p>
<p>So, in terms of creep effect becoming a sudden mass of voting/social empowerment; you have to think: &#8216;If family line X get 6 generations per century while indigene line Y get 4-5&hellip;&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the turnkey point at which their geometric enablement exceeds our containment?  Given the census guesses as to true illegal population counts are just that, I personally think it&rsquo;s going to happen a LOT faster than most people understand.</p>
<p>Quite possibly well before 2050.  Even 2040.  Holding back on occulted population figures until legitimization through &#8216;reform&rsquo; becomes amnesty is thus a cheap way to pop a bomb of massive demographic honesty on us, long after the actual breeding rates between cohort as much as generation groups have done their deed.</p>

		<p>When the most intelligent people have the fewest children and the least intelligent people have the most then you end up with a population that is less intelligent. And I&rsquo;m sure the zero population growth malthusians commenting on this blog realize that. But what they apparently fail to realize is that this isn&rsquo;t simply a matter of one race with below average intelligence having more children and another race with above average intelligence having fewer. No, not at all. In fact, even within each race the people with the lowest IQ&rsquo;s have a higher fertility rate than those with higher IQ&rsquo;s. With such a powerful dysgenic trend I don&rsquo;t see how they can possibly advocate fewer children. After all, the less intelligent people aren&rsquo;t going to listen and aren&rsquo;t going to care. It will only encourage the more intelligent people to have fewer. Is that a good thing? I think not.</p>
