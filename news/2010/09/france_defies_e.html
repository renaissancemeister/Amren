<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&amp;sid=2054289">France Defies EU Criticism on Gypsy Expulsions</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Raf Casert, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy upended a European Union summit to defend his own nation&rsquo;s honor, vowing Thursday to keep clearing out illegal immigrant camps despite accusations that France is being racist and unfairly targets Gypsies.</p>
<p>The summit was supposed to be a forum for molding a unifying European foreign policy, but it turned into a drama of discord  &mdash;  with the outspoken Sarkozy usurping the podium to preach his policies and lash out at his critics.</p>
<p>Sarkozy said comments by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding that linked the expulsions to the mass deportations of World War II were &#8220;disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am head of the French state. I cannot let my nation be insulted,&#8221; Sarkozy told reporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy insisted France&rsquo;s expulsions of Gypsies, or Roma, are a matter of security and said France doesn&rsquo;t have to take lessons from anyone, as long as it respects human rights. He called more than 100 Roma camps dismantled in France in recent weeks havens of crime and undignified living conditions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Britain, so often at loggerheads with France over all issues European, backed Sarkozy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Members of the Commission have to chose their language carefully as well,&#8221; said Cameron, a fellow member of the center-right. He added that &#8220;you should, of course have the right to remove people from your country if they are there illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reding&rsquo;s office has said she expressed regret over the wartime comparison, but maintained her threat to take France to court for targeting an ethnic group in the expulsions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Romanian President Traian Basescu accused EU leaders of &#8220;hypocrisy&#8221; over the Roma expulsions to his country, and warned that those expelled from France may quickly return.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just so like the Left?  Everything has to be decided by some liberal judge.  Guess what, lady?  There are no camps of Germans plotting crimes and befouling the French countryside.  It&rsquo;s the gypsies, and they&rsquo;re the ones who have to go.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the real hypocrite.  Why doesn&rsquo;t he take in his fellow countrymen and make life attractive for them in their own country?</p>

		<p>Surely France should be able to find a place in their great nation for a people who have an average IQ that is even lower than that of African Bushmen. Judging by what I&rsquo;ve read about the Roma, their expertise in pick-pocketing and prostitution should make them well-suited for political positions and jobs in the the public sector.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work out for the deported Roma back in Romania, then maybe they should set their sights on on America. We just love diversity, we don&rsquo;t protect our borders, we are extremely good at making up excuses for people who lack the cognitive abilities required to function in a complex society and we have a very generous federal government. You will also have more civil rights than the people who built America. It&rsquo;s Roma heaven.</p>

		<p>In regards to Anonymous 6:24-<br>
The Roma do not &#8220;originate&#8221; in Romania, despite the name. The Roma or gypsies originated in India centuries ago, and made a slow migration towards Europe.<br>
The gypsies still have a nomadic lifestyle, and often have extended families in various countries. The Romanians don&rsquo;t want the gypsies any more than anyone else does. A higher proportion reside in Romania and Hungary, but are despised by the settled populations there.</p>

[anonymous]<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I disagree with the above poster. I&rsquo;m sure Romania&rsquo;s president  has enough gypsies already to contend with. So understandably, he doesn&rsquo;t  want to see any more being shipped back there, once he was rid of them.  All you&rsquo;re doing is shuffling them around the map of Europe. And I doubt that he regards them as his &#8220;fellow countrymen&#8221; either   &mdash;   just a burdensome bunch of unwanted, troublemaking outsiders. </p>
<p>As for the silly suggestion of  &#8220;making life attractive for them&#8221;   &mdash;   country after country has tried, over several centuries, to settle them and educate them   &mdash;   all wihout success. The gypsies prefer their own casual way of life. They don&rsquo;t want to be like you.</p>
<p>Actually, as has been recommended here numerous times by others, the best solution  (the ONLY solution!) would be to send the gypsies back to India, from whence they came. No country in Europe wants them, and none ever has.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You should of course have the right to remove people from your country if they are there illegally&#8221;so says cameron,so when does he propose to start,for all assylum seekers are here illegally,along with half a million &#8220;economic&#8221;migrants.The worlds basket cases are not the responsibility of the English people,let them sink or swim,for they would certainly do the same for us.</p>

		<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s get the facts straight!</p>
<p>Roma are Indian not European.  </p>
<p>Back to Pakistan (former Hindustan, Roma ancestral territory) is where they should be headed.  Any other non-White non-European nations that volunteer to take several million Roma should be offered handsome one-off inducements for their efforts on a clear premise and undertaking that it shall be a one-way-ticket deal only.</p>
<p>Secondly, all Third World trespassers need to be made to accept the above fact along with all suitable action implemented to effect their necessary repatriation.</p>
<p>Did not these same trespassers who are presently colonising White homelands, banish White Europeans from their own respective homelands during the course of the last century?</p>
<p>Are not White Europeans presently residing in South Africa, currently being subjected to genocide by one of these Third World breeds?</p>
<p>Thirdly, it&rsquo;s time to redress these outrages once and for all regardless of the methods needing to be employed.<br>

		<p>The main reason Sarkozy is taking action on the Gypsies is because there is an election coming up in France, and with this action he takes the wind out of the Front National&rsquo;s sails.I dont think the Romanian President is a hypocrit for pointing out that they will just return to Western Europe once deported, it&rsquo;s just a fact. These Romany Gypsies are beyond the pale and if you gave them all 1 million Euros each they would still live like pigs.</p>

		<p>Sarkozy is making all the right noises now, but let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;s still making them a year from now. A single splashy gesture isn&rsquo;t enough to solve France&rsquo;s problems or anyone else&rsquo;s.<br>

		<p>Gypsy expulsions are pointless. They generally hold EU citizenship (from Romania) and can be back without the slightest hassle. It is like deporting a Pennsylvanian to Ohio. </p>
<p>If we want to make REAL progress, EU nations are going to have to start stripping citizenship of malcontented  Muslims and blacks and shipping them back to their ancestral homelands. Nobody has the guts to do this so they go after the low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>Gypsies while subsisting almost totally on crime and welfare, not unlike blacks and muslims, at least have no pretension of destroying Western civilization, and can be a affable entertaining lot when they want to be, gypsy music can be good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elyQ4ShVw-Y" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elyQ4ShVw-Y</a> and half of them are mostly white at this point, the Pakistani blood is quite diluted at this point after hundreds of years in Europe&hellip;.</p>
