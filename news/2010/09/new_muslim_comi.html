			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edith Lederer, Washington Times, September 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Comic book fans will soon be getting their first glimpse at an unlikely new superhero  &mdash;  a Muslim boy in a wheelchair with superpowers.</p>
<p>The new superhero is the brainchild of a group of disabled young Americans and Syrians who were brought together last month in Damascus by the Open Hands Intiative, a non-profit organization founded by U.S. philanthropist and businessman Jay T. Snyder.</p>
<p>The superhero&rsquo;s appearance hasn&rsquo;t been finalized, but an early sketch shows a Muslim boy who lost his legs in a landmine accident and later becomes the Silver Scorpion after discovering he has the power to control metal with his mind.</p>
<p>Sharad Devarajan, co-founder and CEO of Liquid Comics whose company is now turning the young people&rsquo;s ideas into pictures and a story line, said the goal is to release the first comic book  &mdash;  launching the disabled Muslim superhero  &mdash;  in early November in both Arabic and English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Initially, 50,000 Arabic-language comics will be distributed throughout Syria, and subsequent issues will be distributed elsewhere in the Middle East, Snyder said. The comic will also be available worldwide for free in digital formats through the Open Hands and Liquid Comics websites.</p>
<p>It will be the first in a series of comics with international superheroes, and while one will have disabilities others will not, Devarajan said. {snip}</p>

		<p>This sounds like a Marvel Comics rip-off. A combination of Professor X (X-men) who is in a wheel chair and his arch-enemy Magneto who can move metal with his mind. How original!</p>

		<p>I am a proud owner of a &#8220;Blackman&#8221; comic from the 1970s, created by a local black Gary cartoonist (and an artist with an Irish name). The black superhero character could fly by pulling on straps at the back of his boots (&#8220;lifting himself up by his bootstraps&#8221;). Alas, the comic didn&rsquo;t last past a few issues. Blacks just don&rsquo;t seem to be large consumers of comic books (or graphic novels, in today&rsquo;s terminology). And I doubt muslims are, either.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out that this muslim invention is nothing more than a combination of two white comic book characters&hellip;.Professor X (a wheelchair bound genius with strong mental powers) and his arch nemesis Magneto (a survivor of a nazi concentration camp who can control metal with his mind)&hellip;..from the old (and very famous) X-Men series of comics.</p>
<p>Cheap imitation of white imaginations rather than something new.  I&rsquo;m sure it will gain the amount of attention and following it warrants.</p>

		<p>Certainly I have no problem with Arabs having their own fictional heroes. If this were Marvel Comics or DC trying to sell the Silver Scorpion to amerikan audiences, I&rsquo;d feel differently (although it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me in the least).  But what Arabs do in their own countries in really none of my business.</p>
<p>The only disquieting part is the information that it&rsquo;s all being brought about by &#8220;U.S. philanthropist and businessman Jay T. Snyder.&#8221;  Just who <i>is</i> this guy, and what are his motives?  The website for the &#8220;Open Hands Initiative&#8221; seems to overflow with essentially noninformational platitudes:</p>

<p>Superhero by committee.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they came up with:</p>

		<p>A landmine accident.  Politically correct term for an IED planted by the jihadi.  We already have one muslim comic book sort, Tariq Ramadan, portrayed here:</p>

		<p>Will this super hero leave in the middle of prayers to save human lives?<br>
Will he save non-Muslim lives or just let the infidel dogs die?<br>
Will he take up the banner of holy jihad against the west?</p>

		<p>Oh brother.  What a stupid idea.  I wonder if there will be a muslim slave-woman who can fly with the power of her barqa.</p>

		<p>Pathetic. You would think the fool would use his powers to maybe come up with some legs, metal maybe?</p>
<p>Reminds me of the X-Files with the genie, where the idiot in the wheelchair has three wishes and not one of them is for his body to be made whole again. He tosses around ideas like a gold wheel chair while the genie gives up trying to help him in disgust.</p>
<p>Blatant X-Men ripoff which only gives me MORE reason to hate muslims.</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.upon further research, even the name of this character was copied from white people&hellip;..albeit from a comic before my time.</p>
