<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11251653">UK &#8216;Blind&rsquo; to British Black Female Artists</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Paterson, BBC News, September 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chair of the Mercury Prize has claimed that black British female artists are being ignored by the British public.</p>
<p>Simon Frith told the BBC that &#8220;Britain has a blind-spot&#8221; when it comes to new female urban acts.</p>
<p>The xx  &mdash;  this year&rsquo;s Mercury winners  &mdash;  have seen sales of their album increase by 300%, but last year&rsquo;s victor, Speech Debelle, struggled to shift copies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black female music has always had a particularly tough time,&#8221; Frith said.</p>
<p>The xx&rsquo;s eponymous debut album is expected to climb into the top five on Sunday, its highest chart position after more than a year on release.</p>
<p>Debelle&rsquo;s Speech Therapy, by contrast, sold fewer than 3,000 copies in the week following her triumph, rising to 66 in the charts before dropping out the following week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&rsquo;ve known over the years that British tastes have sort of blind-spots,&#8221; Mr Frith said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be radio play or playlists, promoters or whatever it is. Some sort of music instantly has appeal which gets lots and lots of attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s other sorts of music which will struggle whether they win the Mercury or don&rsquo;t win the Mercury.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are no black British female singers in the UK singles and albums charts, unless they have featured on a TV talent show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you are in the mode of a certain type of entertainer it&rsquo;s very hard space to occupy,&#8221; said Mr Frith.</p>
<p>Sales of urban music in the UK are on a high  &mdash;  up 32.9% in the first eight months of 2010, compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Within the genre, black US-based females, such as Rihanna and Beyonce, fare well. So do their male British counterparts  &mdash;  with Taio Cruz, Chipmunk and Tinie Tempah all scoring top 10 hits in the 12 months.</p>
<p>This weekend&rsquo;s singles chart, meanwhile, will see new entries from Alesha Dixon and 2008 X Factor winner Alexandra Burke  &mdash;  whose Start Without You is expected to debut at number one.</p>
<p>Mr Frith has been the chair of the judges for the Mercury Prize since it started in 1992.</p>

		<p>The most natural question to ask would be:</p>
<p>How do these Black women &#8220;artists&#8221; win awards for their &#8220;music&#8221; when they can&rsquo;t sell their records in the first place?</p>
<p>Virtually every industry and profession has been contaminated with &#8220;quotas&#8221;, even if they&rsquo;re not defined as such.  It would appear that Blacks get awards simply because they&rsquo;re Black, irrespective of how popular or &#8220;good&#8221; their music and singing is.  I think that most folks know that most Black so-called &#8220;music&#8221; today is nothing but junk.  Now the old Black artists in the Motown days were legitimate and great artists.  Coincidentally, or perhaps, not so coincidentally most of the old Black singers and musicians were mulattoes.  Mostly all of them had a good deal of White Blood or were heavily influenced by White standards of musical composition.  To give some examples:</p>
<p>Johnny Mathis<br>
Nat King Cole<br>
Smokey Robinson<br>
Levi Stubbs<br>
Dianna Ross<br>
The Shirelles<br>
The Chiffons</p>
<p>All you need to do is do a Google search for their images and you can plainly see just how much White ancestry they had.  And there were others as well.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care how much &#8220;White blood&#8221; they had. Wish they had none.  That is the problem. Obama also has &#8220;White blood&#8221; and look at his hatred of Whites.  Those you listed all see themselves as black and always will and they do not even like the &#8220;White&#8221; part and are even more prone to be anti-White than any all black person.</p>

<p>If the music and the artist do not appeal then they will not succeed. Period.</p>

<p>Ella Fitzgerald<br>
Nancy Wilson<br>
Johnny Hartman<br>
Billy Eckstine</p>
<p>And as for music written by blacks, countless artists of all races have done &#8220;Sophisticated Lady&#8221;, &#8220;Take the &#8216;A&rsquo; Train&#8221;, and &#8220;Lush Life&#8221;, songs written by Billy Strayhorn. He was Duke Ellington&rsquo;s arranger and pianist and was a composer in his own right.  His music sold, and it sells today, because it was good.  And as either Ellington, or Count Basie put it so well, &#8220;If it sounds good, it IS good&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have the solution:<br>
Let&rsquo;s make some laws forcing the people to buy black music, how about that?<br>
One after another they see that multiculturalism but instead of saying &#8220;ok, nice idea but doesn&rsquo;t work&#8221; they always keep on saying &#8220;We have to change this no matter what it costs and which rights we have to destroy to fix it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To add to commentator #2&rsquo;s insightful comment about the mainsteam soul and r/b singers of the late fifties and sixties, one can consider today&rsquo;s more talented &#8220;black&#8221; singer-musicians like John Legend, Alisha Keyes and Nora Jones. Note the normal names. They all are trained in music theory and composition, speak like intelligent white people, and have melody tinged with jazz, and yes, occasionally a little rap. But so much that you throw up. All three are light skinned and Ms. Keyes and Jones each, I believe, have a white parent who also was a musician or music teacher. Quality, not quantity always is the yardstick in art-whether literature,music or painting. There are only a few talented artists of any background in any society,and the best always at least begin with strong links to prior tradition and custom. </p>
<p>Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, also trained in classical music, is another example of a black artist who should be commended for taking the route of complex, tradition  -rooted music without pandering to the untrained, no-talent electronic thump two-note beats 99% of black wannabe &#8220;musicians&#8221; embrace.</p>
<p>In otherwords, the Conservative Mind, as Russell Kirk described. Not the George W Bush/Karl Rove/Glenn Beck &#8220;inclusion&#8221; nonsense or Obama/Holder Diversity (Oh God, those tacky White House music carnivals this minstrel man President sponors!) </p>

<p>I disagree. What&rsquo;s played over and over on the radio, is what&rsquo;s liked. Being &#8216;good&rsquo; music is important but that&rsquo;s far from the most important thing for it to be liked or become popular. I&rsquo;m surprised black, female artists are not the most popular artists in the UK&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is getting so ridiculous.  It&rsquo;s gone beyond companies not being black enough.  Now award shows are criticized for not having the right number of black winners and consumers have a &#8220;blind  spot&#8221; if something by a black doesn&rsquo;t sell.  Just the other day Regina King complained bitterly about the Emmys being racist because there weren&rsquo;t enough black winners.  You might argue with a black or &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; that there are an infinite number of fields in which the races are represented differently, for example most crime, AIDS rates, and professional basketball players.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there are more sociological measures in which blacks and whites differ than ones in which they are similar.  Since popular belief has it that whites commited the original sin of enslaving blacks, any different representation advantageous to blacks is entirely whitie&rsquo;s own fault and serves him right.  Any skewed representation disadvantageous to blacks is racist and must be remedied immediately.</p>

<p>Certainly true.  My point was that their &#8220;White part&#8221; or &#8220;White ancestry&#8221; was responsible for their talent, creativity, and abilities.  Let&rsquo;s not forget that that was a different time too.  I&rsquo;m fully aware that it is our own genes that are coming back to bite us in the backside.  It only takes a smidgen of White blood to make a mixed race individual hate us, because they have much of our intelligence and individualism.  In this sense, our ancestors mistakes and indiscretions are hurting us today in the 21st Century.</p>

		<p>@AWAKENED,</p>
<p>Your  thesis  is all  wrong.  Just  check out(google) the  enormous  musical talents  that  are  constantly  produced  on the  African continent. Think of Youssour  Ndour,  Hugh  Masakela,<br>
Franco(late  of the Congo: he composed  over  1,000 pieces), Salif Keita, Ami  Koita, Lucky Dube, Fela Kuti(and  his  son), Ali  Farka Toure, etc.  Add to  all  those  cited the creative kora players  of West Africa.  </p>
<p>Point is: having some  European  ancestry  has  nothing to do  with  black  musical  talent and creativity.</p>

		<p>Comment #11, I don&rsquo;t believe that Norah Jones (truly one of my favorites!) can be classified as &#8220;black&#8221;.  Her father is the Indian musician Ravi Shankar and her mother is an American woman, to my knowledge.  I guess I don&rsquo;t consider that as &#8220;black&#8221;, though some might.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, good music knows no race.  Talent can be found everywhere.  I can enjoy Miles Davis and Anita Baker right along with Kenny G and Diana Krall.  It&rsquo;s all about the music.  If it&rsquo;s good, people will buy it regardless of the singer&rsquo;s race.  It sounds as if they are trying to blame the British public for somebody&rsquo;s lack of talent.</p>
<p>But &#8216;urban&rsquo; music?  Isn&rsquo;t that code for rap/hip-hop? IMO, that is not even music.  I can appreciate many genres, but that is not one of them. </p>

		<p>There is a really posh new branch of my gym: luscious exterior, with giant Corinthian columns, and smaller Ionic ones&hellip;gorgeous apricot stucco&hellip;makes me feel like I&rsquo;m in Positano or Monaco, just pulling into the parking lot&hellip;not five minutes, door-to-door from our home.  Safest town in the Jackson Metro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the manager prefers a cable music channel that includes &#8216;Soul&rsquo; and &#8216;Funk&rsquo; from the Sixties and Seventies.  I have gone there three times, and each time had to leave after only minutes.  I refuse to be subjected to Black music, regardless of whether it is supposed to be &#8216;Classic&rsquo; and &#8216;Good Tyme Listenin&rsquo;. I find black music of all genres to be trite, discordant, and obnoxious.</p>
<p>So, I drive for half an hour, through a less safe area, to my gym&rsquo;s scruffy old &#8216;hardcore&rsquo; branch, where the music, when present, is the far more white (and tolerable) &#8216;Power Rock&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Each time I&rsquo;ve been to the beautiful-but-musically-blighted branch, I&rsquo;ve heard younger people complaining about the awful music, before blocking it out with headsets (a gaggle of studly blond building contractors also made some wonderfully obscene comments about the &#8216;music&rsquo; I wish I could repeat).  I think today&rsquo;s (white) teens are vastly more wise than the generations immediately preceding them.  I notice these supremely fit kids also ignore (black-dominated) sports.  Maybe there is hope for the future.</p>

		<p>Kitty, I liked Miles Davis, too, until I read interviews in which he stated that he fervently hated White people. I find this ironic since Whites buy most of his music. I won&rsquo;t listen to a guy who despised me for my skin color even though he never met me&hellip;that is the classic definition of a RACIST!</p>

		<p>Soprano Fan (#4) said: <i>Wait a minute- aren&rsquo;t the Brits forgetting Shirley Bassey, whose rendition of &ldquo;Goldfinger&rdquo; sold millions of copies?</i></p>
<p>Also the themes from <i>Moonraker</i> and <i>Diamonds are Forever</i>, a 007 theme record that still stands. Turns out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Bassey" rel="nofollow">she&rsquo;s half English and half Nigerian</a>.</p>
<p>Adding my $.02 on good black musicians:</p>
<p>The Platters<br>
The Fifth Dimension (Marilyn McCoo is talented <i>and</i> gorgeous)<br>
Gladys Knight<br>
Roberta Flack</p>
<p>Getting back on topic, I&rsquo;m afraid German (#10) is on to something. Given the totalitarian trend in the UK, whites will soon be forced to buy CDs by black musicians, and will be subject to random police inspections to insure they didn&rsquo;t throw those CDs away.</p>
