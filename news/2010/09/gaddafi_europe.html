			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Squires, London Telegraph, August 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Col Muammar Gaddafi has warned that Europe runs the risk of turning &#8220;black&#8221; unless the EU pays Libya at least €5 billion (£4.1 billion) a year to block the arrival of illegal immigrants from Africa.</p>
<p>His remarks, made during a controversial three day visit to Italy, were condemned as &#8220;unacceptable blackmail&#8221; by Italian MPs, who likened the demand to the protection money that mafia gangs demand from businesses.</p>
<p>Speaking at a ceremony in Rome while standing next to Silvio Berlusconi, Italy&rsquo;s prime minister, Col Gaddafi, 67, said that unless his request for money was met, Europe would otherwise become &#8220;another Africa&#8221; as a result of the &#8220;advance of millions of immigrants&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow Europe might no longer be European and even black as there are millions who want to come in,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know if Europe will remain an advanced and united continent or if it will be destroyed, as happened with the barbarian invasions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of desperate African refugees and economic migrants have reached Italian soil by boat from the North African coast, although the influx has been stemmed by the Libyan navy in the last year under an accord with the Berlusconi government.</p>
<p>An MP from the opposition Italy of Values party, Silvana Mura, accused the Libyan leader of holding Europe to ransom, demanding mafia-style protection money in return for a promise to safeguard the continent from unchecked immigration.</p>
<p>Another opposition MP, Luigi de Magistris, accused the Libyan regime of keeping tens of thousands of African migrants in &#8220;concentration camps&#8221; in the desert.<br>

		<p>The Colonel speaks the truth much to the chagrin of the Leftist opposition MP&rsquo;s (many themselves in the direct pay of the Mafia). Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s Right-wing coalition government is spot on and the rest of Europe should emulate his agreements with frontline Libya to keep out the poor ignorant disease ridden criminal blacks. As for the Colonel, my advice to the corrupt feckless Socialist EU is <b>PAY HIM!!!<b></b></b></p>

<p>I have no quarrel with any of those statements, which are plainly self-evident.  But if a <i>White</i> leader had made them, he&rsquo;d have been shouted down as a Hateful Racist Bigoted Xenophobe, if not put under actual arrest.</p>
<p>Apparently only nonWhites are permitted to speak the truth on racial matters.<br>

		<p>Hmm.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that early in this country&rsquo;s history, when the Barbary Corsairs of North Africa were blackmailing us, Congress sent Stephen Decatur not once, but twice, to teach them the errors of their ways.</p>
<p>While I was never a fan of Ronald Reagan, I approved of his bombing of Libya in retaliation for the terrorist bombing of La Belle Discotheque in (West) Germany.  My only criticism is his insistence on &#8220;surgical strikes&#8221;, which history has shown time and again to be useless and actually counterproductive (think Afghanistan).  Had I been President, I would have decimated the city of Tripoli in retaliation to teach Gaddafi and all tinpots like him to mind their manners.</p>
<p>&#8220;From this arises the following question: whether it is far better to be loved than feared, or the reverse. The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far better to<br>
be feared than loved if you cannot be both.&#8221; - Niccolò Machiavelli: &#8220;The Prince&#8221;, Chapt. XVII, 1517. </p>
<p>The EU, which was a bad idea from the get-go, is too weak and effete to mount any effective opposition to someone like Gaddafi, and he knows it!  It&rsquo;s so-called leaders, leftist and neo con &#8220;global federalists&#8221;, are more concerned with making money than in defending their dying civilization.  The West is in big trouble.</p>

		<p>I wonder how much the drug cartels would charge to make it impossible for anyone to come to the US.</p>
<p>Think about this a second. A border state gives them $4 million a year to prevent any motion over that part of the border, no questions asked.  Saves $4 billion a year in needed police state to keep these criminals under control.  </p>
<p>Everything is done illegally and off the books.  No federal government intervention or public knowledge.</p>
<p>There are advantages to having criminals now running our neighbor to the south.</p>

<p>Well, this is exactly the case. In an authoritarian, dictatorial society as run by the Colonel, &#8220;migrants&#8221; can only move about at the sufferance of the local authority, the Colonel by himself having the say whether or not anyone can even BE in Libya, much less travel through the place onward toward Europe.</p>
<p>Italy has made a pact with the devil once [EU], and has now made a second pact with another devil [the Colonel].</p>

		<p>If he does a good job then he&rsquo;s worth it. It&rsquo;s not blackmail, he doesn&rsquo;t have to go out of his way to do anything. The Europeans would have to step in to pick up the slack, so they should go ahead and subcontract out some of the security work. It&rsquo;s probably cheaper since they&rsquo;re well situated to implement it. Pay them for results; cut off all illegal migrants and get paid a bonus. They&rsquo;ll do the work the Europeans won&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>The individuals in charge of running the EU are actually collaborative and sympathetic to the on going mass immigration to Europe of people from Africa. The policy of migration is being actively pursued whereby an intended 50 million Africans are being sanctioned to enter the EU to offset the population decline of the indigenous populations is in full swing, one look at the average city scene today in many a town or city in Europe is proof enough of this staggering yet developing phenomenon. </p>
<p>The high and mighty one world government backing decision makers apparently care little that this influx will cause the creation of a multitude of Detroit type habitats across Europe turning much of a once flourishing continent in to inhospitable surroundings similar to those festering in Black Africa.</p>
<p> When the Europeans finally wake up to this fact it will be too late to do anything about this new condition much like the slow passing away in to a state of decline and urban decay that was the fate of most of the major US metropolitan areas in the 50`s and 60`s of the last century.<br>

		<p>As I said in a previous post Gaddhafi might act the clown but is certainly no fool.</p>
<p>The tone of his race realistic remarks suggests that he not only keeps a copy of the Camp of the Saints in his tent alongside his beloved Koran but also  possibly other material not too dissimilar from what we read on Amren&hellip;I have relatives in Italy that are practically terrified of an black African invasion by stealth.</p>
<p>To think of a great civilization and country to largely go the way of a crime, disease ridden third world place in a generation or two is sometimes too difficult to contemplate &hellip;much easier to bear if its happening slowly before the your eyes even if the horrifying results will be the same.<br>
   <br>
Gaddhafi is only echoing what the anti immigration Northern League and a key partner of Berlusconi&rsquo;s govt has been saying for some time.     <br>
 <br>
The real tragedy is Libya is fulfilling the mercenary role which the Italian navy could do just as well if not better but is constrained by the political correct loonies of the Italian opposition, EU and UN to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>Down under we also face an influx of boat people from Asia rather than Africa and our own Aussie navy similarly constrained by the same mad political correct disease which has infected the entire western world&hellip;what a sick joke!           </p>

Mo&rsquo; has built quite a society that has the top highest regional living standard and an ethnocentric state that supports traditional values and actually enjoys popular support.

<p>Pay the money.</p>
<p>If delivers on his promise to stop the Camp of the Saints invasion, it&rsquo;s well worth the money. Consider it part of the national defense budget - what good are $300 million advanced bomber jets if Europe goes under to this Black African invasion?</p>

<p>* He is shaking down Europe and making no bones about it.</p>
<p>* He is telling the truth about what immigration will do to Europe</p>
<p>* He is actually providing a service.</p>
<p>* He is showing us how contemptibly timid Europe is.</p>
<p>* Gaddafi&rsquo;s message should be a warning to the U.S.  </p>

<p>Im sorry &#8220;ice&#8221; but what an utterly ignorant comment, unworthy of any white nationalist or conservative/Libertarian. For starters the hordes of black Africans that enter Libya are mainly in transit en route to Europe. They must pass through Libya to get to Italy (the nearest point to North Africa). It costs the Libyans £Billions to police their huge borders properly and catch these sub-saharan Africans before they enter. There is also a cost in holding them in detention centres before sending them back. All Gaddafi is saying is, if the EU wants to prevent its &#8220;blackening&#8221; it should fork out some of the cost that Libya must spend.</p>
<p>You mention invading Libya, why? because the Colonel speaks the truth? Have you learnt nothing from Afghanistan. Afghanistan was bombed into submission. 100 000 American troops are present there. Yet drugs, and people flood out of Afghanistan into Europe daily. This heroin ends up on the streets of Europe as do the wretched moslem Afghan illegal immigrants (invaders). Iraq was also invaded and yet hundreds of thousands of third world Iraqis stream into Europe each year. </p>
<p>I know Amren doesnt like personal insults and I hope the moderator can understand im trying to educate the masses of whites (much the same way as Jared Taylor does, although I have to say when I read &#8220;ice&#8221; type comments it does seem to be in vain). People here should <b>READ<b> and educate themselves. I dont expect to see such silly comments here such as the one above from &#8220;ice&#8221; that quite frankly belongs on the &#8220;hip hop board&#8221; (if such a thing exists) or some such other Black American low-IQ forum.</b></b></p>

This is just a form of &#8220;outsourcing&#8221;.  Outsourcing your security to an enemy does not seem like a good idea.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Gaddafi is telling the truth about what immigration will do to Europe. He is showing us how contemptibly timid Europe is.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about that.  He is saying right out loud and openly what nobody inside Europe dares to say. If they did, they would be arrested for xenophobia. Only Ghaddafi can get away with it.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make Ghaddafi brave; it just makes Europe contemptible.</p>

		<p>RIR,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to defend Ice by saying that Americans do think strategically and yet we come from stock that was dirt poor when it came here in during our immigration period and so the notion of handing over 4 billion pounds a year to a terrorist who blew up 259 of us is very offensive when you have evidence from the likes of the the Iran/Iraq war highlighting the effectiveness of relatively small surface group task forces in providing Big Stick protection to tankers (Earnest Will/Armilla Patrol) facing swarms of small boats and occasionally hostile airpower.</p>
<p>On the cheap.</p>
<p>I doubt seriously if these people are swimming.  I further doubt that they are chartering oil tankers or container ships.  They are using small pleasure craft and fishing boats fitted with extra tanks.</p>
<p>Use a network system to ID craft using cellular phone systems with unique, GSE based, encryption chips as self-ident interrogator transponders.</p>
<p>Enforce (with .50 or more) a strict policy of stop and inspect on boats which you suspect are smuggling or which have no network ID code.</p>
<p>Find human smuggling and sink the boat.  Send the Africans back and jail the smugglers.  For life.  Or just shoot them and put the video up on Youtube to spread the word.</p>
<p>I guarantee you, that if you put such an enforcement scheme into the hands of an &#8216;entrepreneuring American&rsquo; they could manage it for significantly less than Ghaddafi is asking for.</p>
<p>As an example of how ridiculous his Jizzya policy is:</p>
<p>year  employees agents  support staff  budget in millions<br>
2009  10,784    5,233   5,551          2,602 </p>
<p>DEA Year By Year<br>
https://www.justice.gov/dea/agency/staffing.htm</p>
<p>2.6 billion for the entire defense of the United States, internal and external against drugs.  The Italians have roughly the same coastal area and configuration as Florida.  DEA would -love- to defend Florida with 2.6 billion dollars.</p>
<p>The Italians also have Predators to act as mini-BAMSes (Broad Area Maritime Support) so it&rsquo;s not like an invasion fleet is gonna crest the horizon with no warning.</p>
<p>And given the distances are so great, it will be hard to increase the transport costs that such low value cargo brings as would make (for instance) a Go-Fast or Airborne campaign farher up into the Adriatic really practical.</p>
<p>Do not assume that because whites are a warrior/explorer derived culture from our wanderjar days in the Ice Age that we are  stupid when it comes to money.  Money is just another representation for resources that we spent a lot of millenia learning to hold very dear.  We also understand distances as logistics modifiers and force on force effects at range really well.</p>
<p>You could say it was in our genes.</p>
