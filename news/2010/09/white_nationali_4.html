<h1>White Nationalist Group to Protest &#8216;Machete&rsquo; Movie With Machetes This Weekend</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Smiley, San Francisco Weekly, August 31 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of white nationalists will protest the new Robert Rodriguez movie Machete  &mdash;  which depicts a Mexican renegade attempting to assassinate an anti-immigrant senator played by Robert DeNiro  &mdash;  at Bay Area cinemas this week. {snip}</p>
<p>Frequent readers of this site may recall the Bay Area National Anarchists  &mdash;  BANA for short  &mdash;  the white nationalist group that showed up at the May Day immigration reform rally at Civic Center Plaza to instead show support of the Arizona &#8220;papers please&#8221; SB 1070 immigration law. BANA founder Andrew Yeoman and two other members were allegedly beaten while leaving the rally by black bloc anarchists, two of whom are now charged with misdemeanor assault.</p>
<p>BANA is also known for showing up to protest the Folsom Street Fair. But they will be doing a warmup act from Friday to Sunday at movie theaters showing the slasher film in the city, North Bay and East Bay, Yeoman says, &#8220;along with like-minded individuals and grassroots organizations nationwide.&#8221; He even started a Facebook page to promote the protest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a press release, Yeoman writes the people of Arizona &#8220;valiantly stood up for Western Culture and state sovereignty vis-a-vis a recent law that prescribed penalties for those who aid in the invasion of our country.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.bayareanationalanarchists.com/?p=147">Armed Anarchists to Protest Anti-White Film With Machetes</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Andrew Yeoman, Bay Area National Anarchists, August 31, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Hollywood&rsquo;s latest anti-White film, the hero is a blood-thirsty illegal alien of Latino ethnicity who slaughters white people with a myriad of weapons. White people are presented as the &#8220;bad guys.&#8221; Even the trailer of the film {snip} begins with the militant Latino telling the viewers that he has a &#8220;special message&#8221; for the people of Arizona, who valiantly stood up for Western Culture and state sovereignty vis-Ã -vis a recent law that prescribed penalties for those who aid in the invasion of our country.</p>
<p>Machete was able to be produced in part by tax incentives and access to locations that were provided by the Texas Film Commission  &mdash;  a division of Gov. Rick Perry&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeoman, the founder and spokesman of BANA, said, &#8220;The members of my organization plan to protest outside theaters that are showing this film. We are bringing our own machetes; it is time our people stand up and say, &#8216;Enough is enough! No more Hollywood filth!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The protesters will be armed with flyers as well.<br>

		<p>It goes without saying, of course, that a film depicting angry <i>Whites</i> going on a violent rampage would never have been made in the first place.  My respect for DeNiro just dropped considerably.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m curious about these &#8220;Bay Area National Anarchists.&#8221;  When I hear &#8220;anarchist,&#8221; I think of unrecovered hippie radicals, yet they are apparently proWhite activists.  Anyone know anything about them?<br>

		<p>Here again is an article that uses the term White Nationalist vs White Supremacists. Perhaps I&rsquo;m being overly optimistic, but I can&rsquo;t help but think of this as a move in the right direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not sure it&rsquo;s a good idea to protest this movie with actual machetes either. Protest for sure, but keep the weapons out of it.</p>

		<p>Welcome to Thunderdome America!! I have an idea to solve the illegal alien problem. We should have a nationwide campaign to buy bus tickets for illegal aliens to move to Hollywood!! We should give them all the diversity they can handle. I&rsquo;ll donate 10 bucks if about a million other Americans will. </p>

		<p>Hollywood is a snake attacking its own tail.<br>
As a corporation it is deliberately blind to the values of America.<br>
Hollywood builds wealth on violence and the violence depicted against whites in films like Machete is a red light that Hollywood is pursuing a greater audience outside America by tapping into the side of less educated people at our expense.<br>
The trade-off in the corporations relentless efforts to amass wealth.<br>

		<p>I learned my trade from a cackling soldier of fortune who would loudly proclaim, &#8220;Alway carry two machetes&hellip; Throw the first one!&#8221;  Which brings me to the point that I hope the indigenous crowd doesn`t claim this cultural artifact as their own, much like hip-hop!

		<p>My first reaction to this piece of, er, &#8220;trash&#8221; movie was that it reminded me of the kind of thing you see on the Spanish language soap operas. </p>
<p>My second reaction (which the story supports) is that I&rsquo;m staying away from any theaters that decide to screen this (I don&rsquo;t really want to get involved in a use of force incident, since everything I&rsquo;ve ever posted here and on other similar sites is discoverable). </p>
<p>My third reaction was that there is nothing Hollywood will not try to make money from, unless it&rsquo;s a movie with Nazis as the good guys. Absolutely nothing.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that this movie, plus many anti-white things the community organizer does&hellip;like pardon the Black Panthers for committing felonies and siding with a ghetto talking trash mouth professor who was in the wrong, because he was black and the cop white&hellip;&hellip;.drives a deeper wedge between the tribes in this pitiful empire than what already exists, and the result is not going to be favorable to the non-white side as the Hispanics and the community organizer want and to believe is going to occur everytime they reveal abject bias and anti-white hatred.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re touch and go right now.  If these fools had half a brain they would be working toward mollifying whitey instead of raising his ire, because he&rsquo;s still the 800 pound gorilla in the room.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t do that, because they&rsquo;re too arrogant and dense to see what is right before their eyes.</p>
<p>And they will pay dearly for it, right along with the white self-haters. </p>

		<p>Good evening,Hollywood strikes again.It is too obvious to mention that the Swifty Lazars of today would never make a pro white film.Too left,too anti white.Propaganda like this is actually quite damaging when one considers the appalling adult illiteracy rate,the dearth of unadulterated news and the literary tsunami of books about vampires.I wonder what the premise?A violent illegal slaughters gringos who are miffed at his presence in their country,he has the right to steal American jobs,create babies and drive drunk to his heart&rsquo;s content.This stuff has to stop.In my experience modern anarchists are a scruffy and odiferous lot who are typically work shy.I can&rsquo;t imagine it going well,especially if weapons are present</p>

<p>Anyone who sees this movie and acts out against a whitey what is in the film is subjecting this Richard Rodriguez to a law suit - - Richard having established a climate of hate leading to a crime being committed.</p>
<p>&#8220;the protesters will probably be arrested for bringing weapons to a public venue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just tell the police you are a farm worker and the machete is what you use on the job. Sort of like those persons who say they need a box cutter for their work, opening cardboard boxes.</p>
<p>I speak in jest.</p>
<p>This BANA is a &#8220;false flag&#8221; operation? Sounds fishy to me.</p>

<p>To be honest, just for once, I would like to see a world where: Latinos, Asians, Arabs, and Africans (be they of the American type, or otherwise) &ldquo;harmoniously&rdquo; dealing with each other and bereft of their great excuse (i.e., &ldquo;whitey.&rdquo;) for being feral, was not something they could feed off of.  I wonder, what kind of &ldquo;unity&rdquo; and &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; would seep from such a boil, like pus transformed into a &ldquo;white&rdquo; wine. </p>
<p>Just how would they occupy themselves or figure out, that 2+2 is not 5?</p>

		<p>I am a Danny Trejo fan thanks to Rob Zombie. That guy ain&rsquo;t no actor but the real deal. There is a documentary about Mr. Trejo&rsquo;s life and it is quite brutal and quite real.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t trust any organization with the word &#8220;anarchist&#8221; in its name. I&rsquo;m a very traditional, old-fashioned persion, and topbe honest I don&rsquo;t understand how someone can support something as liberal - MARXIST, in fact - as anarchy and, at the same time, promote somethign like &#8220;white nationalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, maybe there&rsquo;s a deeper meaning behind the name. Does anybody know?</p>

		<p>Ads for this movie have been all over some channel I watch  &mdash;  probably G4, which has Cops episodes on it.  I thought the lead was supposed to be Native American, but no surprise it&rsquo;s Hispanic.  It looks like nothing but the usual dumb shoot-em-up, attempting black comedy of the yuck-yuck variety with Cheech Marin as a gun-toting priest.  The Hispanics themselves should be protesting such a disgusting image  &mdash;  which tells me a lot!</p>

<i>Bay Area National Anarchists &mdash; BANA </i></p>
<p>I call &#8216;shenanigans&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>No pro-white group uses the term anarchist; it&rsquo;s a leftist term.</p>
<p>This group sounds like the Hollywood idea of what a white nationalist group would be like. Being Hollywood leftists, they mistakenly used a leftist term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet if you slipped into this group and you could mingle with them after (if they&rsquo;re wearing normal street cloths), you would uncover the truth about this Hollywood staged production.<br>

		<p>deNiro must really need the money to agree to play the bad white guy in this schlock slasher film with racial undertones. That&rsquo;s all we need, a movie to excite the Hispanic hordes to rise up and kill whitey&hellip;can you imagine the outcry if a movie were made about a group of Whites who were fed up with diversity and targeted Hispanics with violence?! The Hollyweird double-standard again&hellip;</p>

		<p>So now violence against white people is being promoted in film.  This type of stuff influences people.  Latinos who see it will begin to think it is natural and right to do what this film is suggesting.</p>
<p>Gangsters in Mexico are already known for insane violence that is on par or worse than the fascists of Europe of ages past.  So now we have to worry about Latinos chasing us down with - machetes!</p>

		<p>I can provide some background on BANA.  They are neither a false flag group, nor a bunch of scruffy hippies.  They are a serious attempt to meld white nationalist thought with anarchist principles.  The leader, Andrew Yoeman is a contributor to Alternative Right, among other sites. </p>
<p>Andrew believes in the anarchist ideal of voluntary communities organizing for their own self interest.   In his case he sees that community as being white people in the bay area.  He is opposed to the many layers of government above telling he and his tribe that they must integrate with all comers.  His organization is hated by the more traditional anarchsts and there have been some street hassles between them. </p>
<p>Essentially he is another component of White Nationalism 2.0 where the core ideas of WN are taken but the debris of older organizations, symbols and attached ideas are junked. BANA is white nationalism for San Francisco, which inherently is quite different from White Nationalism for Alabama. </p>

		<p>Ironic&hellip; while this anti-White piece of trash fantasy portrays White people at the enemies of hispanics, in the real world it&rsquo;s the blacks in New York and Maryland who have been attacking and/or murdering Mexicans. But then that wouldn&rsquo;t be politically correct no matter what the evidence is. </p>

<p><br>
Thanks for the clarification, Zeke, most informative. Although I&rsquo;d never heard of BANA, I suspected the explanation was something along these lines: that BANA is NOT some false-flag op, but rather a peculiar new manifestion of WN, in a place known for peculiar new manifestions of older ideas. </p>
<p>And yes, there is such a thing as WN 2.0. It&rsquo;s only in its very earliest stages, and nobody yet knows what further fantastical forms WN might take before this decade is out. In the near future, I expect to see WN thought enter all sorts of new and previously verboten areas. It&rsquo;s what a political movement does when it comes into bloom: it expands into non-traditional (and even non-political) areas. And WN   &mdash;   however frustratingly S-L-O-W-L-Y   &mdash;   <i>is</i> coming into bloom. </p>
<p><br>
<i>BANA is white nationalism for San Francisco, which inherently is quite different from White Nationalism for Alabama.</i><br>
 </p>
<p>Quite so. Although I have no love for Mao Zedong, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that what Mao implemented in China was what he called &#8220;Communism with Chinese characteristics.&#8221; That is, the basis of Maoist thought was Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism, but Mao was smart enough to adapt their &#8220;principles for universal revolution&#8221; to &#8220;principles for CHINESE revolution.&#8221; He customized Communism for his own local purposes. Because Mao did this, his Communist Party is still in power in China after 60 years. Without modifying Marxism for the needs and tastes of his people, Mao&rsquo;s Long March might well have faltered or been turned back long before they made it all the way to Peking. </p>
<p>IOW, Mao succeeded because he understood his market. </p>
<p>Which is why I suspect Zeke and BANA are right: what works in Alabama will not necessarily work in SF   &mdash;   and vice versa. </p>
<p>No, anarchism is not usually something that gets paired with WN   &mdash;   and in some ways seems antithetical to it   &mdash;   but let&rsquo;s all try to remember that there are &#8220;right-wing&#8221; strains of &#8220;anarchism&#8221; (e.g. Libertarians are somewhat anarchistic) as well as the more familiar (and more smelly) left-wing hippie/punk brands of anarchism. Even Ron Paul is, in his own way, a bit of an anarchist in that he&rsquo;d like to see as little govt as possible. </p>
<p>So if Maoism is &#8220;Communism with Chinese characteristics,&#8221; then maybe BANA is just &#8220;White Nationalism with San Francisco characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, whatever gets the job done, right?</p>

		<p>A stupid piece of agit-propaganda disguised as entertainment-what I&rsquo;m worried about is the inevitable copycat attacks on innocent people from this piece of race-baiting, venomous garbage-many of the dumbed-down masses don&rsquo;t need much to be incited to violence.  I&rsquo;m also shocked at Jessica Alba (thought she had some sense/class) to be involved in this type of nonsense-DeNiro i&rsquo;m not surprise-tough guy on outside-total liberal inside.  Guards up all!!</p>
