<h1>Reform Group Argues Canada Lets In Too Many Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter O&rsquo;Neil, Vancouver Sun, September 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pillar of the Canadian establishment, brushing aside the risk he could become embroiled in one of the country&rsquo;s most sensitive political issues, is endorsing a new organization challenging Canadian immigration policy.</p>
<p>Derek Burney is a former senior corporate chief executive, former ambassador to the U.S., one-time chief of staff to Brian Mulroney, and served as the head of Prime Minister Stephen Harper&rsquo;s transition team after the Conservatives won the 2006 election.</p>
<p>Canadian society, he said, needs to stop treating immigration as an untouchable &#8220;third rail&#8221; that can&rsquo;t be debated without prompting allegations of bigotry.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s joined the advisory board of an organization being launched Tuesday on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The Centre for Immigration Policy Reform will be headed by Martin Collacott, a former ambassador who writes frequently on immigration and refugee policy at the Fraser Institute, and James Bissett, a former director-general of the Canadian Immigration Service.</p>
<p>The new group argues the benefits of a high level of immigration aren&rsquo;t worth costs that include considerable government expenditures and higher housing costs, pollution and crowding in big Canadian cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately immigration and refugee policy is a bit like health care in Canada,&#8221; Burney said in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s being denied rational debate at the political level, and this is despite the very clear evidence of abuse of the system, of fraud in the system and a lack of coordination in the country in terms of screening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says his major concern is that Canada&rsquo;s economy has been chronically plagued by relatively low economic productivity, yet the large number of unskilled workers and family-class immigrants weakens productivity further.</p>
<p>Burney said politicians of all stripes refuse to discuss such concerns because some immigrant communities that lobby for high quotas of family-class immigrants are &#8220;very active&#8221; in federal politics.</p>
<p>Burney, 70, acknowledged he was courting controversy that could damage his legacy as a business executive and senior public servant who played a key role in the successful negotiation of the 1988 Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>He is an Order of Canada recipient, has several honorary degrees, and had a street named after him in his hometown of Thunder Bay, Ont.</p>
<p>In 2007-08, he was one of five members of Harper&rsquo;s independent panel studying Canada&rsquo;s future role in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But he said he felt it was time to take a stand in support of Collacott and Bissett, who have argued in relative obscurity for years that Canadian immigration policy needs reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a third-rail kind of issue, nobody wants to talk about it, it&rsquo;s not for polite company,&#8221; said Burney, now an adviser to the Ogilvy Renault law firm and formerly chief executive officer of Bell Canada International and later of the CAE Inc. aviation firm.</p>
<p>Collacott and Bissett &#8220;have a great deal of knowledge about the subject, and they&rsquo;re not irrational, they&rsquo;re not emotional, they&rsquo;re not racists.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re simply trying to acquaint Canadians with the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Centre for Immigration Policy Reform is an organization dominated by academics and former senior bureaucrats, many with links to Canada&rsquo;s conservative movement, who argue that immigration levels are far too high and that refugee screening policy too lax.</p>
<p>Canada has in recent years brought in roughly 250,000 immigrants and refugees annually, and since 1990 has accepted more per capita than any country in the world, according to the Fraser Institute.</p>
<p>There are also 300,000 or so skilled and unskilled &#8220;temporary&#8221; workers in Canada, of which 192,500 arrived in 2009. And the government admitted 79,500 foreign students last year.</p>
<p>The critics say Canada&rsquo;s policy is essentially hijacked by self-interested groups  &mdash;  employer groups seeking cheap labour even when there&rsquo;s high unemployment, lawyers, advocates and consultants in what they call the &#8220;immigration industry,&#8221; and urban MPs from all parties who depend on immigrant groups for political support.</p>
<p>They also cite statistics and reports, including several from federal government researchers, showing that Canadian immigrants since the 1980s have struggled economically compared with the average Canadian.</p>
<p>Others backing the new group include Gilles Paquet, a frequent public commentator and professor emeritus at the University of Ottawa&rsquo;s Centre on Governance, and Salim Mansur, a University of Western Ontario political scientist, columnist, former federal candidate for the Canadian Alliance party under Stockwell Day&rsquo;s leadership, and author of Islam&rsquo;s Predicament: Perspectives of a Dissident Muslim.</p>
<p>Collacott said his group is trying to avoid, rather than import, what he calls the &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; hostility that exists today in Europe against immigrants and minorities. To do that, mainstream parties need to debate the issue openly, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we&rsquo;ve done better than the Europeans in terms of integrating immigrants into society, there are lots of signals that we&rsquo;re not doing well enough,&#8221; Collacott told Postmedia.</p>
<p>Canadians need to debate the questions &#8220;without being called ant-immigrant and racist.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Right now Canada is almost 30-40% non-white.  Indian &#8220;nations&#8221; are reasserting themselves ever more militantly.  Most major cities are majority non-white.</p>

		<p>Many older people alive today can actully remember a time when Canada&rsquo;s population used to be nearly all-white. The only home-grown problem that Canada ever faced was linguistic in nature and not racial, as was/is the case with the US with its long established white and black populations. So shortsighted and arrogant elites decided to create their own racial problems for Cananda by importing people from the third-world. And many of these people have beliefs and practices utterly incompatible with a country that is for the most part the offspring of France and Great Britain.</p>

		<p>Bad news for us.  If Canada does the right thing, it will limit immigration, which will just send even greater  swarms of Muslims to us.  </p>
<p>We are headed toward something horrible, but long overdue.  Thank God Jesus Our White Savior that only about 25% of the population is tainted with a college degree.  That leaves hordes of White teens who can think clearly on issues of race, class, and gender, that is, they put Whites first, Whites always, Whites until the end&hellip; </p>

		<p>Derek Burney could serve the same role as did Britain&rsquo;s Enoch Powell some 42 years ago, in trying to alert the slumbering masses of the dangers of mass 3rd world immigration. </p>
<p>Just avoid any mention of blood and rivers in the same sentence, and he could be Canada&rsquo;s answer to needed immigration reform about twenty years too late.  </p>

		<p>Rational debate about immigration has been discouraged in Canada by the people making the most money off it.</p>
<p>Speculators and land developers are at the top of the immigration industry.  In cities across Canada, they have been enjoying an unprecedented past three decades of housing construction, low vacancies, and rising land values.</p>
<p>At this moment, they have many shovels in the ground and more projects in the planning stages. They&rsquo;re like drunken revellers at a party, and they&rsquo;ll attack anyone who attempts to shut them down.</p>

		<p>If you want to protect your standard of living, of course, allegations of anti-immigration and racism will come into play from third world freeloaders.  A nation is like your home, after working years to keep your home, why would anyone in their right mind invite free-loaders to live for free?  Policitians would stop this nonsense immediately if they were forced to support all these third worlders.  You cannot expect someone coming from an inferior culture and not expect any freeloading.  It is like those islanders who expect those magicial planes to continue coming to drop goodies from the sky.</p>

		<p>This is a huge development for Canada. Finally we have a group of blue chip Canadians calling for immigration reduction. I&rsquo;ve been trying to educate people for years on the topic and its been a handicap not having a prestige organization to back me up. I hope they put out a brochure that we activists can buy in bulk and distribute in our neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>Still, I do think they are being naive about having an open debate like other government policies. To say immigration is a problem is to say that many people now living in Canada shouldn&rsquo;t have been let in. It&rsquo;s saying that Canadian citizens have a right to take avoidance precautions if immigration is allowed to stay high. There&rsquo;s no way this will be debated until 51% of our government agrees and lowers immigration. Instead I think we need to get a much smaller critical mass of dissent. Fearing widespread debate and discontent, all government parties will quietly agree to cutback immigration. </p>

		<p>The population of Canada was 97% white in 1961, is under 80% white today and, if things continue as they have done for the past twenty years, will be only 60% white in 2030 with minority status following soon thereafter.</p>
<p>This news is the first sign that things may not &#8220;continue as they have done for the past twenty years&#8221; and we may hope, cautiously, that the Centre for Immigration Policy Reform has the same effect of legitimising the discussion of immigration as Migrationwatch UK has had in Britain. The calm and unimpeachable factual studies of the disbenefits of immigration produced by Migrationwatch have done a great deal to silence those who always scream &#8220;racism&#8221; whenever the subject is raised,so let&rsquo;s hope that the new Centre has the same effect in what was once &#8220;the great Britannic empire of the north&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Thanks to Pierre Elliot Trudeau to start the tide of immigrants.  Policy continued by Mulroney, Chretien and now Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>It does not matter whether it is conservative or liberal government&hellip;..The result is the same continuation of mass immigration.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is wrong with white people and their current white leaders, but the immigration policies are leading to our destruction.</p>
<p>How can it be?</p>
<p>I can remember when Vancouver and Toronto were 97% plus white.</p>
<p>I guess all good things come to an end.</p>

		<p>Social Altruism comes with Personal Greed.</p>
<p>You grow up in a society so &#8216;perfect&rsquo; (dominated by an upper class of elders as experienced hunter gatherers, keeping the tribe stable, safe and well fed) that the first thing you think to do is _leave_ so that you can have your own dominant group hierarchy rather than be a beta male waiting for someone to die of old age.</p>
<p>Bam.  You make it on your own or are invited into some other group that is down on it&rsquo;s luck, grab yourself a girl and make a few babies.  And suddenly &#8216;it&rsquo;s all about the sharing&rsquo; becaue your benevolent despotism gets you more hands to do your bidding and make -your- old age worthwhile.</p>
<p>A few hundred generations of this and whites have a system that is entirely different from the rest of the world&rsquo;s where tribalism severely limits the notion of beneficial altruism and any kindness given is a perceived weakness to be exploited over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Fast Forwards 10,000 years.  And now it&rsquo;s the 1960s and Imperialist Expansionism is dead thanks to Hitler, and everyone is living in their father&rsquo;s 1950s dream, jealous of the perks and priviliges given to a generation of HGs who went overseas to &#8216;hunt&rsquo; the Nazis.</p>
<p>Since there are no unconquered, empty, lands to deprive locals of, what&rsquo;s a folk to do?  Why sell each other out by the droves.  Using social altruism to ride a wave of ungrateful immigrants displacing and dispossessing the legacy population.</p>
<p>THIS is what is meant when it is said that &#8216;whites only want to compete with whites&rsquo;.  This is what happens when you become so good at war that there is literally nothing left to conquer.  And so you cannot escape your HG tribe to found another.  But have to turn inwards and rob them blind, using class wealth and political betrayal to separate yourself from your own.</p>
<p>It is also why so many people work so hard to deny us all the realities of race as a short list of inherited genetic traits.  Because of course this horrific vision of self-exploitation can only continue so long as there is a white population base large enough to breed back into.  When whites lose their political power, hispanics, asians and blacks will gain their own.  And the only people who will be invited into that party are pretty white girls.  The daughters of the last betrayers.</p>

		<p>Developers, bankers, elite investors and speculators all contribute heavily to pro-immigration lobbying, through political donations and planted media stories. </p>
<p>They have no other mission than to make money, and immigration growth is a dumb-easy way to make return on investments.</p>
<p>It is left to independent think-tanks to raise the alarm, as there is not a politician in the Western world who doesn&rsquo;t know that the knives will be aimed at his back if he dares speak out against mass indiscriminate immigration.</p>

		<p>Ryan has queried the figures on non-whites in Canada. The 2006 census showed indigenous non-whites (Amerinds, Inuit, and Metis) at 3.8% and immigrant and immigrant descended non-whites at 16.2%, a total non-white population of 20%. I very much doubt if the proportion has declined in the past four years which is why I said in my post that the white population is &#8220;under 80% today&#8221;.</p>
<p>The forecast that the non-white proportion will double in the next twenty years if things go on as at present has not been plucked out of the air by me, but comes from Statistics Canada.</p>
