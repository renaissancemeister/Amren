<h1>Black Panther Leader: Whites Use Black Babies As Alligator Bait .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"ZIP," Weaselzippers, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;This is what King Samir, the Philadelphia Chapter, along with the guidance and leadership of Attorney Malik Shabazz has been doing that you don&rsquo;t hear about from Fox Jews, I&rsquo;m sorry, Fox News.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Standing up to neo-nazi groups who consistently threaten our people dead. Now most of them media blood-suckers lies at Crucifox Jews wanna talk about me killing white babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let me tell you stop jumping up and down like the devils you are, creating negative press to keep our people from joining something black and progressive. Yes, I said if you want freedom, you&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with this enemy the way he brings it to us.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot tell a slave how to feel under the pressure of white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not a committer of reverse racism, I am a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Born, brought stolen to the hills of North America. Let&rsquo;s talk about the little black babies that YOU use as alligator bait.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This guy isn&rsquo;t spouting delusional paranoid fantasies, he&rsquo;s just expressing &#8220;legitimate rage&#8221;&hellip;just ask any liberal.</p>
<p>Most of the comments on the original site, however, look like they could have come from Amren, except for one: &#8220;Where are the real Black Panthers?&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect this guy is as real as they come. The heroic image of the Black Panthers came mainly from the MSM.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure anyone uses or used bait to hunt alligators; shooting them with rifles while they&rsquo;re laying on riverbanks does not seem to require bait of any sort.  Does this lunatic think people catch them with fishing tackle?</p>

		<p>This rant would definitely earn a charge, a Court case and a stiff sentence even if it is only a big fine in the UK.   After all if in the UK you can get fined for telling the truth, what would you get for committing slander?</p>
<p>Surely someone in the USA will act on this one and lay charges?  This is not freedom of speech, this is hate mongering.</p>

		<p>Is this not the same man who was involved in intimidating voters in Philadelphia?  Is this not the same racist who stood beside another man, also dressed in the uniform of the New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia and insulted white voters?  And the other man beside him was an elected official, a Democrat.  Yet the mainstream media tells us it is the Tea Party folks and the Republicans who are racist.  A man who with a megaphone publicly urges killing of white babies and who cahorts with an elected Democrat and his NBPP party is excused from charges of intimidation by the Obama Administration - what more can be said.</p>

		<p>They do catch alligators with fishing tackle, sort of. Check out the show &#8220;Swamp People&#8221; on the History channel.</p>
<p>But they use spoiled chicken for bait, the smellier, the better. Spoiled chicken is cheaper than black babies.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen silly old postcards that refer to black children as alligator bait.  They were meant to convey nothing more than sick humor, not something that actually was happening.  Of course, low IQ blacks and the race baiters that prey upon them will try to use such low-grade nonsense as a bugaboo.  Minds that are suspectible to superstition and magical thinking could easily believe such tripe.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be silly.  Black muslims in the UK say far worse than that and the authorities are under orders not to interfere in any way.</p>
<p>You are kidding yourself if you believe &#8220;laws&#8221; like what you are referring to apply to anyone but white people.</p>
<p>Want to see your future?  Look a short distance to france&hellip;..where muslims block whole streets in acts of ethnic intimidation and whites are not allowed to leave their homes.  Despite the extreme illegality of it, the police do nothing.</p>
<p>France also, is the place where a black serial rapist of white women was allowed to argue that racism against him, so enraged him that he was justified in his rape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what is what YOUR government thinks of you.  More to the point, the situation exists because your government does not fear you.  Allowing yourselves to be disarmed several years ago was a huge mistake.</p>
