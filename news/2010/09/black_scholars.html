			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, Sept. 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group probing whether President Obama is addressing issues of concern to African Americans will discuss the issue Saturday at the annual conference of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, hours before Obama is scheduled to address conference attendees. </p>
<p>Political scientist Ron Daniels formed the Shirley Chisholm Presidential Accountability Commission in late 2008 as a mechanism for black leaders to hold the nation&rsquo;s first black president accountable. Eventually, the group hopes to issue a &#8220;Report Card on Obama&#8221; about how well the administration is working to close racial disparities. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The subtext is that there seems to be some hesitancy  &mdash;  to put it mildly  &mdash;  on the part of the Obama administration to overtly address issues of race,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;There is talk about a rising tide lifts all boats. But if there is unevenness in terms of how the boats are situated, then maybe you should look at that instead of some across-the-board notion.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniels, along with some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, has called on the White House to push for initiatives specifically targeting minorities, such as job programs to address high black unemployment. </p>
<p>Obama, who has addressed supporters on black radio and at a reception of historically black college professors this week, has declined to support targeting programs. He says his policies, such as overhauling health care, will help blacks and other minorities who face disparities  &mdash;  along with other Americans. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Faye Anderson, a political blogger who created the Tracking Change wiki to follow the stimulus money and document whether a proportionate share reaches the black community, said she is supportive of the commission&rsquo;s aims. </p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&rsquo;t like what they are doing,&#8221; Anderson said of political leaders, &#8220;then black folks should be holding them accountable.&#8221;<br>

<p>The best news right now would be for afro Obama to come out in favor of racial identity politics, or failing that, for his afro brothers to start making LOTS of noise about what he isn&rsquo;t doing for them because he&rsquo;s scared of the racists in the &#8220;overwhelmingly White Tea Party&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s your answer:  Don&rsquo;t endorse him or vote for him in 2012.  Go around convincing black voters that he, like recently ousted D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, is a secret white tool.  That&rsquo;ll teach Obama.</p>

<p>And what mechanism will be put in place to enable <i>White</i> leaders to hold the Big Chief accountable?  Oh, well, their own cowardice should be &#8220;mechanism&#8221; enough to keep White critics under control.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;the Congressional Black Caucus, has called on the White House to push for initiatives specifically targeting minorities&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose the Congressional <i>White</i> Caucus has made any demands?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Obama, who has addressed supporters on black radio and at a reception of historically black college professors this week&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No doubt I missed his addresses to <i>White</i> radio and historically <i>White</i> professors.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;there seems to be some hesitancy &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; on the part of the Obama administration to overtly address issues of race.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Well, my fellow Whites, looks like it&rsquo;s time for us to step up to the plate.  Oh, wait   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s only <i>blacks</i> who are permitted to &#8220;overtly address issues of race,&#8221; isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Seriously folks, the Big Chief must be laughing over his halal dinner at this childish fuss and bother.  Blacks will <i>never</i> vote against him, and he knows it.  The good comrades at the <i>Washington Post</i> can stop blowing smoke rings trying to pretend otherwise.<br>

		<p>Poster #4 is on to something.  Where I&rsquo;m at, there have been black mayors, black city councilmen, whole districts are populated and governed exclusively by blacks.  There are huge numbers of black people in this city who pass the whole day without ever seeing a white face.</p>
<p>Once in a while the odd-white bohemian do-gooder passes through on his journey of redemption or an old white lady who was too poor to move when all the other whites did so 30 years before shuffles by - but in most parts of my city, I&rsquo;m the only white person I ever see in most places.</p>
<p>Yet they will still cry white racism, even though it&rsquo;s latinos pushing them out and taking their jobs and asians raking in all their money at the stores and such.</p>
<p>When the last white person has left the town, city or even state, they will still blame whitey for all their troubles!  Funny thing is, white people are the only people who give blacks the time of day and fall for their permanent victim line. </p>
<p>Latinos, Asians, Arabs, Turks, Indo-paks - they all HAVE NO TIME for blacks and do not integrate with them or mix with them or GIVE THEM JOBS.  </p>

<p>Obama can&rsquo;t truly fight for them anyway. <br>
He&rsquo;s 50% white/50% black. </p>

		<p>Long story short, the Mexicans are getting the Blacks LBJ (Great Society) promised money. The Blacks are upset that their welfare is getting shorted. What the Blacks don&rsquo;t realize is that their demographic is now a sub-minority. They aren&rsquo;t needed. The Establishment has found a new champion of our displacement with the Hispanics. The Blacks are simply too infantile and unintelligent to achieve the desired results. Conquest by the baby as opposed to the bullet, welcome to Atzlan. The Blacks embrace our displacement in a race (Hispanics) who loathe them as we do. Won&rsquo;t they be surprised? You can complain or do something about it. I am a married (Anglo-Texan Wife) Anglo-Texan father of 6, yes 6 children. I am country, college educated (TA&MU;) and heavily (constitutionally) armed. I&rsquo;m from the country and I like it that way-Tracy Byrd. I own my own small business amd employ 9 (of 9) White young men who themselves have families. I&rsquo;m doing something, I&rsquo;m doing what comes natural. What are you doing? Stop trying to be faux intellectuals and actually do something to help our people. Anything helps. I&rsquo;m not hiding, I am active in my local Tea Party and have submitted my E-mail in this post. I authorize AR to release my personal E-Mail address to the public. Let&rsquo;s see how serious we all are here.  </p>

When blacks were discriminated against it was obvious that they performed and behaved worse than whites.  The question was, &#8220;Are that way because they are discriminated against, or are they discriminated against because they are that way?&#8221;<br>
 <br>
For nearly two generations blacks have not been discriminated against.  They have been discriminated in favor of.  Their performance has improved only marginally.  Their behavior has gotten worse.</p>
<p>Because most of the arguments presented in American Renaissance cannot be refuted, they are suppressed.  As time goes on, this will become less possible.  </p>

There is another reason why blacks will never be satisfied, no matter how much they get. There&rsquo;s a huge industry involved in fighting racism, and a lot of jobs are dependent on it. Between the NAACP, the various government offices which enforce affirmative action, the &#8220;reverends&#8221; who always harp about race, etc. a lot of people would be unemployed and a lot of organizations would lose funding if it was ever decided that a nonracist society had been achieved. As more doors are opened to blacks, the more outrageous the claims of racism become, whether it&rsquo;s racist graduation cards, allegations that minorities face &#8220;barriers&#8221; if the want to go fishing, and the list goes on. </p>

		<p>The only time most blacks will not back another black politically is if they are convinced he cannot win or if they believe another black is more desirable.  If the candidate is not Democratic, he has a big hurdle, but otherwise he&rsquo;s their guy.  <br>
A small number of blacks are visible in the Tea Party, and probably more will eventually join the movement, despite the left&rsquo;s neverending attempts to paint every individual involved as a hood-wearing race-hater.  Interestingly, the NAACP&rsquo;s Ben Jealous, on MSNBC&rsquo;s Ed Show, said the Tea Party should purge the racists from their midsts.  Ed Schultz probably didn&rsquo;t like the statement and quickly moved on  &mdash;  after all, aren&rsquo;t ALL white people, including Ed himself, virulent racists?  I think all these white race-baiters should give their jobs to a black, don sackcloth and ashes, and walk the streets with protest signs!</p>

		<p>Barack Obama was elected president of a country where most of us recognize that black social pathology, especially black crime, are serious problems.  Rather than expect special favors from him, blacks should be glad that one of theirs made it to the White House.  They should also hope that the rest of his presidency is more successful than the first year and a half have been. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s possible to get the average black to believe any kind of conspiracy at all if it presented in a way that makes them victims or makes them into achievers and great scholars.</p>
<p>Aid was introduced by whites to kill off blacks; drugs saturated the black community to bring them down and destroy the black community.  The levees in N.O. were blown up to drown N.O. blacks, etc.</p>
<p>Well, the thing to do is a have few right wing conspiracy bloggers start putting forth the story that Obama despises his black blood and is looking to decimate the black population, because they embarass him for their inability to achieve on an intellectual level.  Reducing the black population by eliminating all the black dullards will elevate blacks as a group it must also be maintained.  Non-stop.  Constantly.</p>
<p>Success will be realized when Obama has his first full-scale riot based on complaints that Obama is racist and wants to eliminate blacks.  </p>

		<p>Let it be clear that I believe Obama to be a socialist, and inimicable to the growth of a healthy economy. Neither blacks nor whites benefit from this fraud. However, it does give me pleasure to hear the whining of the black intelligensia, such as it is. </p>
<p>What they should have known from the beginning of this very vapid person&rsquo;s campaign, is that he stood for nothing.  <br>
BTW, &#8220;black&#8221; spokespeople, this fraud is not black. He is not white. He is something out of Twain&rsquo;s fiction.<br>
 <br>
The Minstrel Man has entertained, but as usual has not delivered.</p>
<p>Thank goodness he has not delivered to the nontaxpaying population. He&rsquo;s doing enough damage in many other ways.</p>

		<p>This is why Blacks don&rsquo;t join the Tea Party movement which stands for less taxes and less government. Blacks are appear to be the least self-sufficient people, and they utterly depend on the government largesse. Obviously they don&rsquo;t want any part of independently minded Tea Party activism?</p>

		<p>Oh my. Isn&rsquo;t this getting to be an old, tired refrain. The names of the black organizations change through the years, the targets of their thinly veiled threats change and might even be of the same race. And the wording might change. But it all boils down to wanting new programs instituted for blacks. TRANSLATION: WHICH WAY TO THE FREE STUFF!</p>
