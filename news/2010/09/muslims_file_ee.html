			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vickie Elmer, Washington Post, September 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 160 Muslims have enlisted the federal government in two discrimination lawsuits against JBS Swift meatpacking plants, where they allege blood and bones were hurled at them, bathroom walls were covered with vile graffiti and company supervisors disrupted their efforts to worship during Ramadan, ultimately firing many Islamic employees.</p>
<p>The two Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuits filed last week allege a pattern of religious and national origin discrimination and a hostile work environment at two plants  &mdash;  in Greeley, Colo., and Grand Island, Neb. The cases may rank among the largest Muslim discrimination lawsuits since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, unleashed a backlash against Muslims in the United States, government officials said. In the last five years through fiscal 2009, religious charges have grown 44 percent overall, and 58.4 percent for Muslim workers, according to EEOC data.</p>
<p>The JBS Swift cases, which involve mostly Somali refugees who joined the plants&rsquo; diverse and often immigrant-based workforce, stand out not only for their size but also for their details, EEOC officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s fairly egregious when you have your co-workers throwing bloody animal parts at you,&#8221; said Justine Lisser, the EEOC&rsquo;s acting communications director in Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hassan Abdi Farah, 70, worked processing meat in Greeley and said through a translator that he was given progressively more difficult assignments. Sometimes, he said, other workers threw meat and fat at him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When he complained to a supervisor, Farah said, he was warned not to file a complaint or he could lose his job.</p>
<p>The Greeley case alleges supervisors also threw animal parts at Muslim workers. In addition, workers said that they were harassed when they tried to pray during scheduled breaks and that their requests to pray during bathroom breaks were denied. The bathroom graffiti included denegrating references to Somalia, anti-Muslim language and use of the N-word.</p>
<p>Then in 2008, as they began their holy month of Ramadan, complainants allege, the situation escalated.</p>

		<p>A civil rights suit by Somalis?  <br>
Somalis wouldn&rsquo;t know how to file a lawsuit or even what a lawsuit is, without someone guiding them every step of the way.<br>
So who?  Look to the usual culprits who are always seeking to stir the pot.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve asked this before but never could find an answer. Isn&rsquo;t Swift Meats a pork processor? If so, how would a Muslim justify working there even under ideal conditions?</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s probably something to this. Just the same, years ago I worked at a restaurant where Muslim cooks became the majority or at least there were a lot of them. The would openly make fun of the whites. I doubt any equal employment opportunity claims were filed however, they would have been laughed at. Well, maybe one of the Muslims did make a claim. </p>

		<p>Swift and company are getting what they deserve.  This is the same company who advertised for Mexes south of the border and provided transportation for them to get up here.</p>
<p>With this recent lawsuit, they&rsquo;re getting a taste of what true multiculturalism really is.</p>
<p>Like Tyson, I wonder when they&rsquo;ll be instigating for Somalis to come over and do their dirty work at starvation wages.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if Swift and Tyson both were targeted for jihad.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Maybe hiring immigrant Muslims is more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiring ANY black or muslim OR black muslim, isn&rsquo;t worth the trouble or the potential danger. Like other posters though, I have no sympathy for these companies that bring these damn muslim blacks into America for cheap, federally subsidized labor, hope the companies go bankrupt with no bail out to teach other companies (especially those with stockholders) a lesson. A further affront in all of this is that after the companies dump the muslim blacks, they end up on the local welfare systems flooding it and the local hospitals with their incessant ailments.</p>

		<p>If non-whites and non-Christians don&rsquo;t like how we do things, then leave!  I&rsquo;m curious as to how muslims treat non-muslims back in their homelands?  (That was a rhetorical question)</p>

		<p>Back when White and Black Americans (Mostly white though), worked at meat packing plants would we have ever dreamed that that this nonsense would be upon us? I&rsquo;m trying to think if I can remember John Chancellor, Walter Cronkite, or Harry Reasoner opening the nightly news with an announcement like this. &#8220;Today, the FDA has ordered a recall of 5 million pounds of beef processed by the ACME meat packing company of West Boondock, Nebraska for suspected Ecoli contamination.&#8221; Is it just me, or does it seem like we have a lot more food recalls than we did in the past? </p>
<p>A friend from high school used to drive a truck and occasionally deliver meat to packing plants out west. He told me of going into one of these places that had been overrun by the Somalis. (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here) &#8220;As bad as the projects were when we went to high school, these people just aren&rsquo;t second class citizens, there ninth class illegals. Heck, I prefer the Mexicans over this bunch any day of the week. These Somalis make Cabrini Green look like Rodeo Drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were he still alive, Upton Sinclair could probably have a field day with a rewrite of &#8220;The Jungle&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I live in Grand Island, Nebraska. This use to be a nice quite town with very little crime, especially violent crime, but that was when it was majority white. Then all these people from Sudan and Somalia were brought here by the liberal diversity loving idiots and now this town is a little Chicago. And with the influx of illegals adding to the problem, crime is so bad the city wants to hire more police officers which means property taxes will increase. And it is the white homeowners that are paying this tax. I am always amazed when I see these Sudanese and Somalians driving their expensive cars and talking on a cell phone. Where do they get their money? How do they get loans with no credit? How do they get a credit card? You would think these people would be glad to be in America, and would be law abiding, but no they want everything for free, will work only on their own terms. Murder, rape,assaults, and robbery are common occurrences in Grand Island now. If you are white you don&rsquo;t want to move here or even visit. And one other thing I have noticed that is common in this town, the number of black men with white women. What a town, what a country.</p>

		<p>Damn shame.  I&rsquo;m from the Midwest.  It&rsquo;s a shame to see it being overrun with non whites and as the last poster pointed out, seeing our women with non whites.  Goodbye, whites.  It was fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>Olewhitelady, don&rsquo;t give up on that thought, I know the muslims and our government (as most of us do) and they will soon make that demand AND! our government will support said DEMAND!</p>
