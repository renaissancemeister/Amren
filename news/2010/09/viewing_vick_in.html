<h1>Viewing Vick in Black and White</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Les Bowen, Philadelphia Daily News, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I WAS TALKING to an ex-NFL player last week, guy I hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while, and eventually we got around to Michael Vick. The ex-player is African-American, from the rural South. His take was that Vick&rsquo;s prison term for dogfighting was way too harsh, and that people should let that go, as Vick remakes himself as the quarterback of the Eagles. The ex-player recalled seeing Sunday-afternoon dogfights in a park where he grew up, witnessed (and presumably wagered upon) by the local police.</p>
<p>This was not an isolated occurrence. I think if you surveyed the largely African-American Eagles locker room, that guy&rsquo;s take would be the perspective of a huge percentage of the players.</p>
<p>Race is such a tricky, hot-button thing, so many of us just try to pretend it isn&rsquo;t a part of the issues we deal with, even when it obviously is. The Eagles&rsquo; locker room shocked much of the (white) fan base by voting Vick the Ed Block Courage Award last year. Hmmm. What do you think that was about?</p>
<p>Another conversation last week, with a (white) agent. He was talking about going to a Super Bowl party many years ago, when Vick was near the start of his career. The party was largely African-American, and the agent remembered being surprised at how Vick&rsquo;s presence resonated with other famous players and guests  &mdash;  &#147;It was like Michael Jordan had walked in,&#8221; the agent said.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Roger Goodell was so interested in Vick&rsquo;s rehabilitation was Vick&rsquo;s standing in the African-American community. Pre-dogfight scandal, by 2007 much of white America might have seen Vick as a sideshow, a quarterback who never took his craft seriously enough to win anything. Black America saw an artist, an elegant, unstoppable performer. (They now see him as an elegant, unstoppable performer who has been persecuted by white people.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, here we are, with Vick starting for the Eagles, and playing well. All over the Internet, people (mostly African-American) argue that he has paid his dues and should be embraced. Other people (mostly not African-American) argue that torturing and killing dogs over a period of years isn&rsquo;t something you just shrug off because a guy went to prison for a while and is now playing real well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vick has been nothing but decent and courteous to me. I can&rsquo;t reconcile what he has done with the guy I talk to in the Eagles&rsquo; locker room. {snip}</p>

		<p>I am of two minds about Mr. Vick.  I agree with the main thrust of Mr. Bowen&rsquo;s article.  Americans of African descent tend to see shades of White persecution in Vick&rsquo;s treatment.  However, the same group (mainly Afrcian americans) overlook some of the other points outlined in the article such as the award Mr. Vick won from the mostly white fan base.</p>
<p>As a born-and-bred Southerner, my biggest fault with Vick is the insouciance in which Mr. Vick treated his position and status as the NFL&rsquo;s point man in Atlanta (and by default the South.) Even before the dog-fighting allegations, Mr. Vick was not eaxctly reading from the NFL&rsquo;s script on how a prized &#8220;asset&#8221; should behave when in the public&rsquo;s eye.  </p>
<p>But since sports is entertainment, and athletes are &#8220;entertainers&rsquo;, Mr. Vick&rsquo;s peccadilloes are par for the course in a field which includes sociopaths like Ty Cobb (a fellow Georgian unfortunately), ladies&rsquo;s man Ben Roethlisberger, and accused paedophile Lawrence Taylor.  Good company indeed!</p>

<p>Is there a racial divide in perceptions of Vick? Fo sho. All those nice white NFL fans with pampered golden retrievers can&rsquo;t be too comfortable even with a &#8220;rehabilitated&#8221; Vick. </p>
<p>As far as black people believing he was persecuted, that&rsquo;s all too easy to believe, what with all the conspiracy thinking that was the subject of an AmRen article posted a few days ago.</p>
<p>This kind of double-think required of a fan (Vick-Evil/Vick-Awesome) is a big reason why I&rsquo;m not much of a sports fan any more.</p>

<p>Right. Vick used sadistic training methods and was in the habit of hanging dogs [lynching?] dogs that did meet his criteria for acceptable performance. It was Vick that acted as the &#8220;beast&#8221; and not the other way around.</p>
<p>And something is forgotten about all this. It was not just the mistreatment of the dogs. His operation and the betting that was going on was BIG TIME. The guy had to be into big time gambling with big time wagers, win or lose. He might have owed someone a lot and that could translate into throwing games, etc. </p>
<p>The man is totally incorrigible as far as I am concerned. He should not have been given a chance at all.</p>

		<p>Michael Vick is a mediocre NFL quarterback.  To paraphrase Al Campanis, Vick lacks certain necessities required for that position.</p>
<p>With regard to his torturing of dogs, I believe Vick&rsquo;s prison sentence was commensurate with the crime.  </p>

		<p>Michael Vick is a violent sociopath. Dog fights are an ignorant and vicious form of entertainment, bad enough by itself. But what the black community tries to downplay is the pure torture and brutal acts perpetrated on these poor dogs by Vick and his cohorts. Slamming their heads repeatedly into concrete floors until the dog was dead and much, much more.</p>
<p>And of course black people will say he paid his dues and give him a free pass -  they do that with any black person who screws up. Marion Berry, just to name one, who the black community kept re-electing as mayor of D.C., despite knowing he was smoking crack, screwing prostitutes and misappropriating funds. Sure they support people like this - which shows just how miserable their lives are. Remember the old proverb &#8220;Misery loves company&#8221;?<br>
Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of truth in proverbs.</p>
<p>I used to like Whoopi Goldberg until I heard her on The View defend what Vick did by calling it a &#8220;cultural&#8221; thing that people of other cultures would have a hard time understanding. Other cultures being code for white people. I lost all respect for her with that ignorant comment. There is no defense for Vick, he&rsquo;s just another violent sociopath trying to hide behind has race. And anyone who would defend has actions would have to, at the very least, be one cold hearted creep. The lowest of the low are people who prey on defenseless animals and children. <br>

<p>Well, viewed in that historic context and being supported by the author ties, I suppose lynching was no big deal either.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that Mr. Vick didn&rsquo;t just have dogs fight, he hanged, drowned, electrocuted, and slammed them on the ground as well.</p>

<p>AR isn&rsquo;t snipping articles to simply make selective points.</p>
<p>Most newspapers don&rsquo;t take kindly to having their content posted in full without permission (It&rsquo;s called copyright infringement). So what web sites like this are forced to do is cut the piece down so it&rsquo;s only quoting from the article. If people want to read the whole article for full content, the link is provided. That way, AR can post the story but readers are then directed to the original link.</p>

		<p>As a long time Eagle fan, This is my opinion of the situation:<br>
1-The only people whose opinion matters are Eagle fans.<br>
2-If Vick plays well and the Eagle win, he will be their hero.<br>
3-If Vick does not play well, he will be a bum to everybody.</p>

		<p>Yes, there, there.  Poor black man.  It&rsquo;s not his fault.  It&rsquo;s our fault.  We didn&rsquo;t give him opportunities.  We made him turn to crime.  We need know to apologize by giving more affirmative action jobs to blacks, more Section 8 housing, more white women, more (anti-white) blacks to positions of power, more talks about the &#8216;racist history&rsquo; of America, etc.  Remember, it&rsquo;s always our fault why they are in the mess they are.

		<p>People forget that until this became a federal case it looked like Vick was going to get off easy even in the face of all the pressure from the animal rights groups.</p>
<p>If this never crossed state lines Vick would have gotten just another slap on the wrist and we&rsquo;d be talking about him in the past tense because the years of getting smashed to pieces by linebackers who are too fast for the old college scrambling quarterback routine would have taken their toll by now and he&rsquo;d be washed up.</p>

		<p>What I took away from this article is that most blacks are alright with fighting dogs to the death. Torturing and slaughtering dogs mauled too severely to repair or for poor performance is just good fun. Just imagine the exciting thrill they get when duct taping a bait-dog&rsquo;s snout shut when making it ready for practice for their fighting dog.  </p>

<p>The whole description wasn&rsquo;t much different from what Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome suffered at the hands of those other &#8220;Americans of African Descent&#8221;. I assume that the dogs weren&rsquo;t raped and sodomized before being killed. But then who knows. The story of the two S.African &#8220;youths&#8221; who raped a German Shepherd comes to mind. </p>
<p>May those early slave traders and plantation owners roast in the eternal flames of Hell (I REALLY hope that there IS such a place)<br>
for what they wrought upon the South and later, the rest of us.<br>
Just think of what a country this would be without that segment of the population. We could then concentrate on ridding ourselves of the White sociopaths without being fettered by fear of being called racists. </p>

<p> I totally agree with you and I would refuse to close ranks around any degenerate white dog fighter/torturer as well. Blacks lose sympathy from whites by supporting the criminals and sociopaths within their community. Michael Vick should have been banned for life from Professional Football, but the greed of the mostly white franchise owners triumphed over decency.</p>

<p>Hanging? He didn&rsquo;t just hang the losing dogs (dogs that were already torn up and bleeding from the fight). His little friends also beat the dogs to death, electrocuted them and had fun drowning them.</p>

		<p> This is not to condone or excuse the sadistic nature of Vick and his action&rsquo;s, but had they been committed against people you would hardly hear a peep of outrage. This would be true if the victim&rsquo;s were black and more so if they were white. Black&rsquo;s as a group will defend almost any bad behavior by a famous black, even against other black people, this seems to be a part of their nature. Could someone explain why so many white people defend and make excuse&rsquo;s for them? </p>

		<p>Growing up in rural Florida where cockfighting is still a pretty big underground sport I have to say race has nothing to do Mr Vick prosecution. Animal rights groups rabidly push law enforcement to make arrests and fully prosecute anyone caught taking part in bloodsports of any kind. An interesting note about cockfighting is under the Adams-Otis treaty where the US acquired the territory including the state of Florida. Cockfigting was a specifically protected sport and would remain so in perpetuity. The government got around that legal obligation by simply charging people with animal cruelty rather than the technically legal act of cockfighting. Even though taking actions to circumvent or defeat the spirit or intent of a law is a crime in itself. Too bad no one holds the government to the standards they hold us to.</p>

		<p>The key point I think is raised at the end with the mention of Imhotep Charter School.  You cannot be rewarded for something you did that enabled you to do something else that is criminal.  Not and act as a spokesperson to children and young adults.</p>
<p>And a middle class Michael Vick would never have bought that kennel or abused those dogs.  It took serious money to make that happen.</p>
<p>Just like it takes serious commitment to be an example for others to follow.</p>
<p>By stating that the Eagles organization is proud to have Mr. Vick return as &#8216;front man&rsquo; for the franchise, what Joe Banner (President of the Eagles) is saying is that it&rsquo;s okay for Mr. Vick to be a role model who is looked up to by others and seen as deserving of that respect because he is a good player or a rich black, not a _decent man_.</p>
<p>The kind of &#8216;exemplary&rsquo; behavior that crushes a dog&rsquo;s skull on the ground, that hangs a dog or ok&rsquo;s electrocuting one, is not the kind of person you want to be held up as a role model for kids at a High School to try and emulate.</p>
<p>I have no problem with Mr. Vick becoming a successful businessman outside the NFL.  Even simply a retired athlete who lives well off what he has made.  But to say that he should be considered by the team or the fans as some kind of persecuted hero is wrong.</p>
<p>And it points to the race issue.  Because I thought that one of the conditions of a &#8216;raceless&rsquo; society was that we all held to a common set of values.  That those family and societal values which we all shared were what made us all equally deserving of a chance at success.</p>
<p>Yet now, it looks like &#8216;post-racial&rsquo; really only means &#8216;nothing is true, everything is permitted&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And that is also wrong.  Because if it had been a white man who had done these things, I would be the very first to say &#8220;I do _not_ want him admired by young people&#8221; or allowed another chance at the same career whose rewards had enabled his prior crimes.</p>
<p>And that apparently makes me different from blacks who want blacks in power because they are black.  That makes me better.  </p>
<p>So the question you have to then ask is why would blacks want to defacto admit that, unless he&rsquo;s also willing to admit the corellate: that all&rsquo;s he cares about is social dominance and exploitation without a code of limiting ethics at all?</p>
<p>And how far can you trust that kind of attitude?</p>
<p>By being selectively amoral, they have made it about race.  Not me.</p>

		<p>Typical black stupidity and ignorance!  Blacks don&rsquo;t have the intelligence, forsight and/or knowledge of human behaviour to see anything except in terms of race!  Also, anyone like myself who had to lve among them or work with them can attest, their standards of what&rsquo;s acceptable behaviour are lower than ours. Finally,due to their high levels of only a rudimantary educational atttainment at best, and lack of perceptivensess regarding different types of human behaviour, they certainly don&rsquo;t know what sociopathy is.  I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but one of the hallmarks of sociopathic behaviour is cruelty to animals. Plus Vick never seemed to express any real remorse for what he did to those dogs.</p>

<p>I cannot write what I&rsquo;d like to here about vick without being either censored or banned from this site.</p>
<p>Question:  If vick were White would he be playing for the NFL?</p>
<p>Here is a link to the Michael Vick dog chew toy  &mdash;  you can choose from an Eagle&rsquo;s uniform or a Prison uniform  &mdash;  plus a bonus video showing pit bulls chewing on an effigy of Vick  &mdash;   dogs&rsquo; revenge.  </p>
<p>AND a poll:  Do you support The Eagles decision to hire Michael Vick? (so far):</p>
<p>Yes:  22%</p>
<p>No:  12%</p>
<p>Hell No:  66%</p>
<p><br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2n5whn" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2n5whn</a></p>
<p>How long before that toy is declared &#8216;Racist!&rsquo; and banned  &mdash;  guess I&rsquo;d better order one today  &mdash;  make that two, one for each of my dogs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the toy in the prison uniform, which as far as I&rsquo;m concerned is where vick should still be.</p>

		<p>Being from outside (praise the Lord)) Atlanta, we had to eat, sleep and s*** &#8216;Mikey&rsquo; daily from the time he joined the Falcons. There were all the skirmishes he got in locally - every month or so Mikey was in trouble again - dog fighting issues from suspicion through arrest, trial, sentencing, jail time, probation, until after he was hired by (God knows why) by the Eagles. Years of it. Also during that time two of his younger brothers, who were college football players, were also arrested, one several times. One was [finally] expelled from the team. Several uncles are also felons.</p>
<p>Michael is nothing more than a typical black punk whose only attribute is that he can temporarily run fast - just like the males in his family, and the majority of males of his race. Once some greedy, morally bankrupt sports team owner lavishes the big bucks on them, they are officially on another plane - in their feeble mind they are bigger and better than the rest of us and are to be worshipped, no matter how they act. All because WHITE PEOPLE tell him so.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s see, a &lsquo;racist&rsquo; is forever a racist but a dog torturer and killer can be a complex individual with good and bad qualities but ultimately a stand-up guy&#8221;.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a stand up guy because he&rsquo;s bigger and stronger than other players&hellip; And that&rsquo;s just what the white kids must believe.</p>

		<p><i>The Eagles&rsquo; locker room shocked much of the (white) fan base by voting Vick the Ed Block Courage Award last year. Hmmm. What do you think that was about?</i></p>
<p>I remember that.  He got that award for (supposedly) not misbehaving after he got out of prison.  Not misbehaving after you get out of prison is what you should do.  It&rsquo;s the minimum expected behavior of paroled felons.  You shouldn&rsquo;t get an award, &#8220;courage&#8221; or otherwise, for behaving at the minimum expected level.  That would be like making the all-C student the valedictorian.</p>

<p>Ummmm&hellip;if Vick was convicted of murdering 7 humans via sadistic hangings, drowning, electocution and beatings he would be considered a minor league SERIAL KILLER and YES people WOULD care. He surely wouldn&rsquo;t be playing for the NFL after a 2 year prison sentence. </p>

<p>Remember that there&rsquo;s the law, then there&rsquo;s public opinion.  A black man recently shot up a beer distributorship after getting busted stealing and all anyone could talk about was &#8220;did his racist co-workers drive him to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Never underestimate the ability of Americans to miss the key issue, Sonya.</p>
