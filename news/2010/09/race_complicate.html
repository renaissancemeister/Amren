<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100905/US.Who.is.an.Indian/">Race Complicates Reservation Crime Fight</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sudhin Thanawala, Comcast News, Sept. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For more than two hours on the night of May 16, 2007, Shane Maggi terrorized a Native American couple at their home on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, pistol whipping them and firing bullets above the husband&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Maggi, who suspected the couple had stolen his drugs, was convicted by a federal jury in 2008 and sentenced to more than 42 years in prison. But an appellate court here found Maggi did not meet its definition of a Native American and, as a result, had been prosecuted under the wrong federal statute.</p>
<p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Maggi&rsquo;s conviction in March.</p>
<p>The case illustrates a hazard of the complex legal system used to mete out justice on American Indian reservations  &mdash;  a system that relies largely on race to determine jurisdiction, and then charges police and prosecutors with the sometimes delicate task of determining a person&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole flaw in the system is that it&rsquo;s premised upon being an Indian defendant or Indian victim, and yet we have no clear-cut definition of who an Indian is,&#8221; said BJ Jones, director of the Tribal Judicial Institute at The University of North Dakota law school.</p>
<p>In most states, federal and tribal authorities can arrest and prosecute Indians on Indian lands. But criminal offenses by non-Indians are handled by federal or state authorities, depending on whether the victim is Indian.</p>
<p>That means when a crime is committed on Indian lands, authorities must determine the suspect and victim&rsquo;s race before they can answer fundamental questions like which agency can make the arrest and try the case, and sometimes which law applies.</p>
<p>Tribal officials and legal experts say this process creates confusion that can lead to delayed cases and even overturned convictions on reservations, which already endure high crime rates and shortages of law officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody in law enforcement wants to do the right thing,&#8221; said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just, you have this very complex, Byzantine jurisdictional system that impedes effective law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legislation introduced by Dorgan and signed into law in July aims to increase the powers of those tribal police who are unable to arrest non-Indians on their reservations.</p>
<p>Tribal officials say enrollment cards generally make it clear who is a tribal member, but difficulties can arise when that identification is lacking. Matters also can be complicated by intermarriage with other races and the movement of Indians to other tribes&rsquo; reservations.</p>

		<p>Right. Each and every tribe has their own definition of WHO is a tribal member or WHO is an American Indian.</p>
<p>1/2, 1/4, 1/4, 1/8, etc. And grandparents on one side are or grandparents on both sides are, etc.</p>
<p>All based upon blood relation. And if tribal intermarriage too, that also complicates things. A Blackfoot and a Ute makes a? That is the question.</p>

<p>Who cares?  And why does it matter anyway?</p>
<p>I say give them all a state right next to a couple of states with blacks and mestizos, build a 100 foot wall around them charged with a million volts of electricity, and let them do or die on their own merit.</p>

		<p>As much as possible, the feds should butt out of the business of states, territories, and Indian reservations.  It&rsquo;s amazing that Native Americans are still being treated like colonials, scarcely different than they were 150 years ago.  <br>
Anyone who steps on Indian land should be treated to their laws.</p>

		<p>Indian Reservations are distinct governmental jurisdictions, just like cities, counties, states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the various territories.  If you commit a crime on a reservation you should come under the jurisdiction of that reservation just as if you had committed a crime in Baltimore or Alaska.  If the reservation needs to have you extradited because the  perpetrator escaped then you go for extradition.  Leave the whole racial thing out and make the law consistent across all jurisdictions.  Pretty simple solution because the Indian Reservations, while nominally &ldquo;nations&rdquo; are in fact less independent than even Puerto Rico and it is time to end the charade.<br>

		<p>If a person commits a crime on Indian lands, they should be under the law of those lands, regardless of race.</p>

		<p>I just got back this morning from Seattle Wash. (2752 miles). Ive only been home for 3 hours now. I stopped at an Indian reservation in Montana, as a matter of fact, to get gas and I have to say that eventhough me and my son were the only White People there they were pleasant and cordial to us. No attitude, no &#8216;stern looks&rsquo; like you get from blacks as you attempt to take hang a right around a corner while they stand there waiting for the bus.</p>
<p>Apparently they didnt believe us to be any kind of threat to them.</p>

		<p>I think the laws about federal prosecution for felony crimes committed by Indians on Indian lands came about because it was expected that an Indian would not easily get a fair trial in a state court.</p>
<p>That said, I am suprised that non-Indians are not subject to federal prosecution for felonies they commit on reservation lands (tribal courts take care of the misdemeanors).  My understanding was that Indian reservations are like airports, post offices and military bases; that the feds have jurisdiction<br>
over everything that happens in these places - if they want it.</p>

<p>I sort of doubt there are many blacks on Indian reservations in Montana.  &#8220;Shane Maggi&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t sound like a black name either.  </p>

		<p>Just an update: it does appear that the perp is not black.  In fact, it seems he doesn&rsquo;t fit into any recognizable category:</p>
<p>&#8220;In his appeal, Maggi did not challenge that he pistol-whipped the Hoyts for allegedly stealing illegal drugs from him, but he contended he is not a Native American for purposes of prosecution.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that Maggi has very little Indian blood, is not an enrolled member of any tribe, is not eligible to be an enrolled member of any tribe and does not receive any tribal benefits.&#8221;</p>
