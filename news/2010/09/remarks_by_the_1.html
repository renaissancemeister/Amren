<h1>Remarks by the President at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute&rsquo;s 33rd Annual Awards Gala</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The White House<br>
Office of the Press Secretary<br>
For Immediate Release<br>
September 15, 2010</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you to Senator Menendez, and to the Chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congresswoman Velázquez, for those extraordinary introductions, but more importantly for the outstanding work that you do each and every day. Please give them a huge round of applause. (Applause.) Thank you to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute for inviting us this evening. Michelle and I are thrilled to be here with so many friends to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I also want to acknowledge and thank all of the outstanding Latino leaders serving across my administration because I am proud that the number of Latinos I&rsquo;ve nominated to Senate-confirmed positions at this point far exceeds any administration in history. (Applause.) And I&rsquo;m especially proud that a whole bunch of them are Latinas. (Applause.) </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> Some take advantage of the economic anxiety that people are feeling to stoke fear of those who look or think or worship differently  &mdash;  to inflame passions between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have news for those people: It won&rsquo;t work. There is no &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them.&#8221; In this country, there is only &#8220;us.&#8221; (Applause.) There is no Latino America or black America or white America or Asian America. There is only the United States of America  &mdash;  all of us. (Applause.) All of us joined together. Indivisible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Today, the folks who yell the loudest about the federal government&rsquo;s long failure to fix this problem are some of the same folks standing in the way of good faith efforts to fix it. (Applause.) And under the pressures of partisanship and election year politics, most of the 11 Republican senators who voted for that reform just four years ago have backed far away from that vote today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why states like Arizona have taken matters into their own hands. And my administration has challenged that state&rsquo;s law  &mdash;  not just because it risks the harassment of citizens and legal immigrants, but it is the wrong way to deal with this issue. (Applause.) It interferes with federal immigration enforcement. It makes it more difficult for law  &mdash;  local law enforcement to do its job. It strains state and local budgets. And if other states follow suit, we&rsquo;ll have an unproductive and unworkable patchwork of laws across the country.</p>
<p>We need an immigration policy that works  &mdash;  a policy that meets the needs of families and businesses while honoring our tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. We need it for the sake of our economy, we need it for our security, and we need it for our future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, the Senate is going to have a chance to do the right thing over the next few weeks when Senator Reid brings the DREAM Act to the floor. (Applause.) Keep in mind, in the past, this was a bill that was supported by a majority of Democrats and Republicans. There&rsquo;s no reason why it shouldn&rsquo;t receive that same kind of bipartisan support today. I&rsquo;ve been a supporter since I was in the Senate, and I will do whatever it takes to support the Congressional Hispanic Caucus&rsquo; efforts to pass this bill so that I can sign it into law on behalf of students seeking a college education and those who wish to serve in our country&rsquo;s uniform. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. We should get it done. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Now, I want to be straight with you. To make real progress on these or any issues, we&rsquo;ve got to break the Republican leadership&rsquo;s blockade. {snip}</p>
<p>For example, consider the public servants I&rsquo;ve nominated to carry out the people&rsquo;s business. Most of them had been supported widely and approved unanimously by Senate committees. But they&rsquo;ve been held up for months by the Republican leadership. We can&rsquo;t even get an up-or-down vote on their confirmation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And then they use their voice to drown out yours. To let Wall Street write rules that take advantage of Main Street. To let insurance companies write rules that let them cover or drop folks whenever and however they please. To go back to that &#8220;exact same agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, tell me you something. That agenda didn&rsquo;t work out so well for the Latino community. It didn&rsquo;t work out for anybody here in America. It is not going to solve the challenges we face. We can&rsquo;t go backwards. We&rsquo;ve got to go forwards. </p>
<p>So let me say this, not just to the folks who are in this room, but to the Latino community across this country. You have every right to keep the heat on me and keep the heat on the Democrats, and I hope you do. That&rsquo;s how our political process works. (Applause.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So let me close by saying this. Long before America was even an idea, this land of plenty was home to many peoples. To British and French, to Dutch and Spanish, to Mexican  &mdash;  (applause)  &mdash;  to countless Indian tribes. We all shared the same land. We didn&rsquo;t always get along. But over the centuries, what eventually bound us together  &mdash;  what made us all Americans  &mdash;  was not a matter of blood, it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of birth. It was faith and fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard audio from this speech all over talk radio the last two days.  What I noticed was that when Obama said:</p>
<p><i>So let me close by saying this. Long before America was even an idea, this land of plenty was home to many peoples. To British and French, to Dutch and Spanish, to Mexican &mdash; (applause) &mdash; to countless Indian tribes. We all shared the same land. We didn&rsquo;t always get along. But over the centuries, what eventually bound us together &mdash; what made us all Americans &mdash; was not a matter of blood, it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of birth. It was faith and fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear.</i></p>
<p>The applause was real loud after he said &#8220;Mexican.&#8221;  There was no applause, loud or otherwise, for any other ethnicity mentioned.</p>
<p>BTW, Obama might be right about the Mexican thing   &mdash;   Archaeologists have even unearthed the trash to prove it.</p>
<p>This part also piqued my interest:</p>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s why states like Arizona have taken matters into their own hands. And my administration has challenged that state&rsquo;s law &mdash; not just because it risks the harassment of citizens and legal immigrants, but it is the wrong way to deal with this issue. (Applause.) It interferes with federal immigration enforcement. It makes it more difficult for law &mdash; local law enforcement to do its job. It strains state and local budgets. And if other states follow suit, we&rsquo;ll have an unproductive and unworkable patchwork of laws across the country.</i></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want Hillary Clinton to be President no more than Obama.  However, this illustrates an important tactical difference between pragmatics like the Clintons (by pragmatic, I mean for outward appearance only), and hard core ideologues like the Obamaites.  If HRC were President, and Arizona passes SB 1070, and a bunch of other states would follow suit, a Hillary Clinton-run White House wouldn&rsquo;t sue Arizona and the other states.  She nor her WH staff would make no public statement in opposition, in order to to rile up political blow back at the Democrats.  But, she would quietly order ICE not to process any illegal aliens that these sorts of state laws would yield. </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a win win for the Democrats   &mdash;   they get their quiet backdoor amnesty, but by not mouthing off about it, they get no conservative backlash.  </p>

		<p>They have you there, they are autochtonous, you are not and you screwed yourselves when you cut off your ties to England in the 18th Cent, not to mention setting several toxic precedents. But your argument&rsquo;s strength lies in the superiority of your traditional pre-modern culture over their&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Obama: &#8220;It (the Arizona law) interferes with federal immigration enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Correction! The Arizona law enforces federal immigration law while the federal government refuses to enforce the same law. Why do we bother to pay ICE and Border Patrol if Obama and Napalitano have ordered them to stand down??</p>

		<p>Putting aside the fact that this president promotes divisiveness by making such appearances, and especially by his speeches, he is historically correct in his pandering view of &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; being here before there was an America.  First, &#8220;Mexicans&#8221;   did not live north of the Rio Grande. There were a few, VERY few, Spaniards in northern New Spain, and they were certainly not what we or anyone else would consider &#8220;Mexican.&#8221;  (Of course, Mexico as a nation didn&rsquo;t exist until 1810 or 1821.)  Second, once Mexico became a country unto itself, it failed to colonize or populate north of the Rio Grande, and requested whites to come in and settle.  Third, once the US had PURCHASED northern New Spain, Mexico asked the US to purchase the lower part of what is now New Mexico to protect against the predations of the Comanche (the Gadsden Purchase). So his view of history is defective.</p>
<p> By the way, what is the pressure he expects the &#8220;Latino&#8221; (whatever the heck that means) community to keep on the Democrats?  Condoning, promoting, forgiving and acceptance of illegality?</p>

		<p>Where to begin&hellip; &#8220;There is no Latino America or black America or white America or Asian America. There is only the United States of America&#8221; - This may be the way it used to be, but not anymore. We are now more categorized by race than anything else. That the left (President in particular) keeps telling us we are not so categorized only reaffirms that we are.<br>
&#8220;We need an immigration policy that works&#8221; - NO immigration right now would work quite well.<br>
&#8220;We all shared the same land&#8221; - Like heck. No one shared any part of the land.  It was very much &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;, or more like &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221; and &#8220;them over there&#8221;, etc., and we all had weapons to keep it that way.<br>
&#8220;It was faith and fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear&#8221; - Oh, he means the ideas written in the constitution&hellip; written by White men, who considered themselves mostly to be of one extended family (birth and blood). This is more a speech by the anti-President than anyone else.</p>

		<p>Any Mexicans that were here before the Southwest was settled by whites, were so small in number as to be insignificant.  And speaking of settlement and building, the anti-white community organizer isn&rsquo;t bright enough to understand that the land here in the US is not in dispute, it is what whites created on the land that is desired by third world hordes, including blacks, of course.</p>
<p>As by design and stupidity, he&rsquo;s creating a scenario that never existed and giving credit to people who did nothing, all because he wants to diminish whites and white achievement to nothing, while, at the same time, he denigrates whites for nearly everything.</p>
<p>This is what happens when blacks and other third worlders are allowed entry to this country.  The community organizer is giving credence to radical mestizo claims that the Southwest is their land, although their people are not responsible for the civilization that exists on it.</p>
<p>This kind of stupidity moves us more rapidly toward civil war II.  </p>
<p>My, my, my.  How much this evil black despises whites.</p>

		<p>Oh, yes, EVERYBODY was here before whites.  </p>
<p>And they built everything after settling the remote areas too, didn&rsquo;t they, community organizer?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering, however, if he agrees that the indians were racist for wanting to kill all whites who crossed their lands.  Or is that sort of behavior o.k. if the victims are white?</p>

		<p> What is it with the white race? Build the greatest nation on the planet and everybody else suddenly lays claim to it. Build the greatest canal the world has ever known,(Panama Canal) give it away. Produce the world&rsquo;s greatest military, the world claims it as their personal police force. Elect a president that goes completely against the white interest just to prove you are not racist.<br>
 Say no to anything, then you are called xenophobic, racist and all kinds of vile names. This guilt complex has gotten completely out of hand. I hate to say this; but it seems that the white race is on some sort of death wish.</p>

<p>Teddy Roosevelt said the same thing.  Evidently it still doesnt mean anything.  The last time I checked, the Americans who referred to themselves as &#8220;FILL IN BLANK HERE&#8221;-Americans were not self-described as &#8220;WHITE&#8221;-Americans.</p>

<p>THEY really don&rsquo;t feel this way. Those are just words for public consumption and nothing more than that. They DON&rsquo;T feel that way.</p>
<p>And I see other forum members feel the same way I do. Came to the same exact conclusion and did so instantly. We all read the same thing and came to the same conclusion and did so at once. Amazing.</p>

		<p>The issue is not who was here first in this country or any place else but what kind of society/culture did certain racial groups/gene pool created.  This country was built on white brain power and now hordes of third world peoples are coming for the milking.  Third world peoples have their own lands/resources but no brain power to build a prosperous nation.  So they are all come here demanding in convoluted ways for the handouts.  Then the politicians like obama lusting for the power, votes, and money manipulate these third world peoples into believing that they are entitled to what the whites created.  This milking will not stop until the whites have enough will power to say enough is enough.  At first, there will some dirt kicking but the message will sink in.  Otherwise, the whites will continue to  get robbed.      </p>

<p>Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but before the United States was formed there were no Mexicans inhabiting any part of the southwest. There were Indians and there were Spanish but no Mexicans. Mexico didn&rsquo;t gain independence from Spain until 1821.</p>
<p>Nice pandering Mr. President! </p>

<p>This is of a piece with Hussein&rsquo;s comment a few weeks back that &#8220;Islam has always been a part of America&#8221;&hellip; in spite of the well-known fact that prior to the past three or four decades there were virtually ZERO Muslims in America&rsquo;s first 200 years. </p>
<p>Both his previous whopper praising America&rsquo;s newfound Islamic history and his latest whopper praising America&rsquo;s newfound Mexican history, show the workings of a mind determined to give credit for America to ANYBODY except white people. This is the sort of kneejerk anti-Western rewriting of history one would expect to find in some smug Professor of Critical Race Theory, not in a President. It&rsquo;s just astounding to me to hear this insane Faculty Lounge claptrap in official White House pronouncements!</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t stress enough that, not only are Obama&rsquo;s statements insulting to heritage-stock Americans, what&rsquo;s more important is that they are FACTUALLY WRONG! They are LIES! The President is standing up in front of crowds and cameras and telling OUTRIGHT FALSEHOODS that anybody with a history book or access to Wikipedia can disprove in a matter of moments! </p>
<p>And the MSM lets him get away with it. </p>

		<p>The majority of Mexicans and Hispanics I know are so ignorant of history they are incapable of historical discussions.</p>
<p>When you see Hispanics going about your daily life have you noticed that when you view Mexican TV stations you don&rsquo;t see the same types of people.  The only difference between a Mexican and an Hispanic is that river (Rio Grande), but why the different body types, the different skin complexions, the difference in the eyes? when that river is crossed.</p>
<p>Please notice.  And remember this, they are the racists otherwise you would be seeing the same types of people across the spectrum.</p>
<p>Believe me, they are racists.  La Raza, and what they think about blacks is well known, and the fact they feel whitey is to be used in anyway possible.<br>

<p>When do we get a white caucus to rebutt this nonsense?</p>

<p>&#8220;This guilt complex has gotten completely out of hand. I hate to say this; but it seems that the white race is on some sort of death wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say at least 90% of Whites are in the throes of that death wish. They have no righteous racial morals, no courage, a complete &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; of what Christianity really is about, afraid of their own shadows, brainwashed to such a degree that they are impotent in more ways than one, or are mentally incapable of TRUTH. </p>

Has it really?  Or is Obama paying actors again to provide the audience he wants.</p>
<p>Usually, when Obama shows up and gives a speech, he gets heckled, and it&rsquo;s not by conservatives.  The far left has been hassling him mercilessly and basically wants him gone.</p>
<p>But the far left is only a tiny portion of the population, mostly non-white.  The vast majority of people in the US just don&rsquo;t oppose immigrants, they MILITANTLY (as in stocking up guns and ammo) oppose immigrants.  And that is a bipartisan thing.  Heck, it&rsquo;s even among spanish speaking Americans for various reasons (like white spanish speaking people hate black spanish speaking people and indian spanish speaking people).  There is no such thing as a &#8220;hispanic&#8221; and among spanish speaking people in American, only a certain racial stock wants amnesty.</p>
<p>With all these people so opposed to immigration, I find it very unlikely that a spontaneous group listening to Obama&rsquo;s speech on this, support him, or immigrants.  Obama has been caught, multiple times, creating an &#8220;audience&#8221; of hand picked actors, while keeping real people out of the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, he&rsquo;s doing it again here.  Don&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>

		<p>If anyone really believes Mexico was here before the US was even an idea, the United States was the product of a lengthy period of the best European thinking and traditions - from ancient Greek democracy, the Roman senate (a quick look at Washington DC&rsquo;s governmental architecture shows this Classical influence, and the Washington Monument is really just an obelisk, for crying out loud), to the Magna Carta, which established that citizens have some rights that royalty must respect, and the Enlightenment, which extended the idea.</p>
<p>Mexico, on the other hand was merely the result of some trappings of post-Reconquista Spanish monarchical &amp; feudal culture plastered over traditional Mesoamerican despotism.</p>

		<p>How can Obama claim there is no white America, no black Amerca, no Latino America and no Asian America on the one hand, and celebrate &#8220;diversity&#8221; on the other? Then, he laughably says, &#8220;we are joined together, indivisible&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t think that even HE is stupid enough to believe it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the James Bond movie, &#8216;Die Another Day&#8221;, where Bond (Pierce Brosnan) says to &#8220;Jinx&#8221; (Hallie Berry), &#8220;Just because we&rsquo;re on the same side, it doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re after the same thing&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why would anyone think Mexico is somehow more legitimate than the US? In addition to the points already made   &mdash;   such as that the US is the oldest independent nation in the New World, and Mexico even agreed to sell more land (the Gadsden Purchase) after the Mexican War   &mdash;   Mexico, never a democracy, is at least as much a product of European colonialism as we are. Do Mexicans break and enter because the US is really Mexico or because we&rsquo;re not?</p>
<p>The Spanish utterly subjugated the natives, and were genocidal towards the Aztecs. That they later mixed with them and created a mestizo people changes &hellip; what? If the European-drawn boundaries of their former colonial empire matter more than those drawn by independent countries later, then does Mexico still belong to Spain and the Thirteen Colonies to Britain? The Aztecs lived around Mexico City, and had zero to do with the land north of the Rio Grande, and neither do their descendents.</p>
<p>Mexico lost the war it started with the US, and then signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo accepting payment and agreeing to peacefully solve future disputes. The US, occupying Mexico City, could have claimed all of the country but President Polk wisely took just the empty lands and refrained from making Americans of the mestizo masses. The US assumed Mexican debts, offered citizenship to the tiny few Mexicans in the Southwest and guaranteed their property. In short, both parties settled over 150 years ago. How do we owe them?</p>
<p>Is a house my ancestors owned for a short time, long ago, rightfully mine? We could go on; the absurdities pile up. Worst of all, ignorant Americans actually listen to this nonsense, and the so-called President of the United States is the worst anti-American of them all.   </p>
