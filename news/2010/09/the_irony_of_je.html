<h1>The Irony of Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s Stripped SUV</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Payne, Detroit News, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Following the embarrassing news that Mayor Dave Bing&rsquo;s GMC Yukon was hijacked by criminals this week, Detroit&rsquo;s Channel 7 reports that the Reverend&rsquo;s Caddy Escalade SUV was stolen and stripped of its wheels while he was in town last weekend with the UAW&rsquo;s militant President Bob King leading the &#8220;Jobs, Justice, and Peace&#8221; march promoting government-funded green jobs.</p>
<p>Read that again: Jackson&rsquo;s Caddy SUV was stripped while he was in town promoting green jobs.</p>
<p>Add Jesse to the Al Gore-Tom Friedman-Barack Obama School of Environmental Hypocrisy. While preaching to Americans that they need to cram their families into hybrid Priuses to go shopping for compact fluorescent light bulbs to save the planet, they themselves continue to live large.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need an economy that creates employment that can&rsquo;t be shipped overseas,&#8221; the Green Rev wrote for CNN about the march. &#8220;Home-grown American labor will be installing windmills and solar panels. A green economy is not an abstract concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Even now, the only sector of the economy that has seen job growth during the recession is the green job sector. Time is of the essence.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Real jobs produced big, profitable SUVs like the one Jesse prefers to ride in. His SUV has been stripped by thugs  &mdash;  a fitting metaphor for what Jesse and his pals have done to the auto industry for the last 35 years.<br/>

I don&rsquo;t see it so much as a metaphor for what Mr. Jackson did to the auto industry but what blacks did to Detroit (and other blacks).</p>
<p>I bet that&rsquo;s the real message only the reporter couldn&rsquo;t phrase it as such; take and destroy.</p>

		<p>The irony of JJ&rsquo;s Caddy being hijacked is funny. But why didnt he arrive from Chicago or wherever he hangs his expensive hat these days in a Limo?? A stretch limo. Dont tell me the Rev can&rsquo;t afford one after so many productive years of extortion of Toyota, Madison Ave and any corporation stupid enough to pay him off, and there were plenty.</p>
<p>Indeed, my regret about the early demise of Dr. King is that he would have outdone Jackson in extortion and wealth to an infinite degree. We would have had a gold plated Memorial to Rev. Red King on the Mall, while he was still alive,with juicy threats of boycotts and strikes against any fool dumb enough to oppose it.</p>
<p>Well, Rev. Jackson does create jobs. GM workers will just have to roll out another Escalade. Question. Will JJ pay for the replacement or will his insurance go up?</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>Actually, black buyers are more likely to buy American made cars, but no American demographic is doing too many favors for Detroit, actually. </p>

		<p>When Jesse and his thugs and rent a thug used to commute daily to Decatur IL from Chi to hold the local schoo&rsquo; district hostage, they were the worst road hogs in the world, driving in a convoy at top speed, everyone in a big SUV, etc. Took over the road and made a bad nuisance of themselves. And did that daily over a course of weeks.</p>

		<p>For fear of losing his job the author can&rsquo;t mention the destruction of Detroit by a certain racial group.</p>
<p>Instead he brings up another salient point: the hypocrisy of liberal environmentalists like Bing, Jackson, Al Gore and Barbra Streisand who travel in SUVs, limos and private jets while lecturing the rest of us to trade our car in for a bicycle and to live like the Flintstones. </p>

		<p>Jessie never was anything more than a thug running a protection racket.  He is no better than the guy who would tell pawn shop owners they better share some of the profits with him and his friends or maybe his shop would get burned down or at least his store window would get broken.  Jessie would rant and rave about so called greedy corporations and then extort them so he, his friends and family would secure franchises and dealerships from those same companies or else boycotts (breaking the store window) after he secured the dealerships he would throw crumbs to his people showing appreciation for their part in the extortion racket.  If people were paying attention they would have noticed what Jessie and his buddies were really up to instead of believing the mainstream media telling us all about Jessie&rsquo;s fight for so called social justice.  If people were paying attention Jessie&rsquo;s phony ideology would have been stripped bare long before his SUV was.</p>

		<p>I heard Jesse say on TV last night that inner-city criminals should be hired to &#8220;landscape&#8221;.  Sorry, rev, your liberal friends have already given that job to the Mexicans!</p>

		<p>When I worked at a black-run business the bosses had to have the latest cars. Top guy rolled in a Mercedes. Meanwhile, we stiffed our vendors for six-figure bills&hellip; details, details. </p>

		<p>I always &#8220;read the signs&#8221; before parking. It does not matter how sweet the deal a local business is offering for services or products if one has to risk life or property to shop.</p>
<p>The signs I notice the most are the ones sitting on steps, or standing on sidewalks, idle, and with necks craning at each<br/>
car or individual that appears before them.</p>
<p>Jackson was just a person we do not feel so bad about it happening too. Jesse should have known better since even he has stated his relief when alone and hearing footsteps approaching when realizing those feet are white.</p>
