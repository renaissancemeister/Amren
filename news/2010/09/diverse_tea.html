<p>I say good and let it go!</p>
<p>Look, my brothers and sisters of the race, there are just certain things that we must: adapt to; use; exploit; and finally seeing things our way, never end unless we have to. When I write about, &ldquo; finally seeing things our way,&rdquo; have no doubts. A Germany with nothing but Germans in it; an Italy with Italians only concerned about what happens to sturdy the Tower of Pisa and not some toppling Mecca; a Westward Russia, strong and sound; and a USA that is 88% white and not caring how the MLK Idol there in Washington DC is done away with: be it by bombs or crowbars!</p>
<p>If certain Spanish (by this I mean Spanish whites, not Latinos or Hispanics) elements prove reliable, why not let them in?</p>

		<p>I went to the first Tea Party here in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Thats the only one Ive been to. I thought it was going to morph into a White Thang,but just as my wife suspected&hellip;a dud.</p>
<p>The Tea Party knows full well who their enemy is but yet too scared to profess it.</p>
<p>They are scared of their enemy&hellip;&hellip;.so they support it.</p>

		<p>Glen Beck and the Tea Party   &mdash;   both started out hopefully, then sold out to the Diversity Borg. It seems that the best way to co-opt anyone in this country is to accuse them of &#8220;Racism.&#8221;  As they rend their hair and don sackcloth and ashes to absolve themselves, they inevitably come around to embracing approved liberal values, especially on race.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Respectable Conservatives(tm) always lose.<br>

		<p>In a certain sense, I can see why the Tea Party has to promote some diversity. In order to be a force, it must get those who are pro-White but skittish about coming out of the closet so to speak. The Tea Party does demand and end to illegal immigration and closed borders. Also,  there are some Blacks and Hispanics who do hold Tea Party values.</p>

		<p>What is it about us White people and our aversion to being seen to as grouping up together with our racial identity being the bonding factor?</p>
<p>Do we subconsciously see it as low or tribal or as somehow primitive and hence a step backwards or something? Or do we see ourselves as being inherently evil?</p>
<p>There was some talk last week of the group dynamics of Whites and non-Whites when fighting and how we have different ideas about fairness, honour and chivalry. <br>
Are these internal ethics we have being used against us to stop us banding together?</p>
<p>For some reason it&rsquo;s considered a crime for us to group up, just see how these Tea partiers are squirming at the accusations of being too White.</p>
<p>Is there the fear that we&rsquo;re going to start genocide on an industrial level, a la WW2 if left to our own devices?  <br>
We Whites surely don&rsquo;t have the monopoly on genocide.</p>
<p>In a natural disaster us White&rsquo;s spirits truly shine on the group level.<br>
Remember the story from Hurricane Katrina where the Whites who were in the Superdome, indentified the violent and chaotic dangers surrounding them, encircled their group &lsquo;wagon train style&rsquo; with woman and children in the centre and then the men slept and took guard duty in shifts until the authorities could be summoned for evacuation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange how we Whites never get given the victim status, we&rsquo;d probably be too proud to take it, but it is never given to us.<br>
We&rsquo;re actually called supremacist&rsquo;s when we group together, yet we (at least those who I proscribe to) don&rsquo;t ever claim that mantle.<br>
It is inferred by those outside of our group that we must be superior, by their fear of us uniting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that we are superior, I have immense pride in what makes our group unique and I want to live in a culture made by my people for my people, but I appreciate that our gifts are a mixed bag and it is our weakness&rsquo;s that are letting us down, such as our inability to collectively take our head out of the sand and weather the shame of maybe not always taking the high road in matters.</p>
<p>As we have indentified in left wing Whites, it is their &lsquo;White arrogant&rsquo; need to be seen to be superior in all moral deeds by paradoxically claiming equality or inferiority, that actually makes them the two faced supremacist&rsquo;s in their own twisted indirect way. <br>
And the only time they ever show any back bone is at the easiest of targets, themselves i.e. &lsquo;us&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Far from being a supremacist, I think we need to group together for more pessimistic reasons, as all the numbers associated with our people are winding down or declining. Perhaps it is that part of us that thrives in a disaster which is reacting now, from seeing the storm clouds gathering on the horizon, and the instincts are saying that we need some solidarity here.<br>
You could say it is because of our weakness, that we need the strength of numbers. </p>
<p>Us being the &#8216;anti-group&rsquo; does us no favours and only benefits every other racial, ethnic, religious group. Nationally we are disappearing whilst still maintaining the numerical majority! While internationally we already are the minorities! And the guilt mechanism that has been used to keep us externally and internally separated is going to make sure that when we are the national minorities, that none of that chivalrous, &lsquo;high road&rsquo; behaviour we&rsquo;re hoping will be forthcoming, is going to be paid back to us when we are the vulnerable group. <br>
A revenge mentality will be more likely for our combination of smugness and weakness, neither of which originated from this side of the political spectrum.  <br>

<p>Problem is, it is NOT White Spaniards they are promoting. They want Mexicans, Blacks etc. Just look at all the black speakers they have at their &#8220;parties&#8221;. Look at who they are backing for political office. Black after Black. This is what far too many so-called White movements do. They ALWAYS cave. They are all for diversity and to make excuses for them and think they even care about their own RACE, or even have any thoughts of racial solidarity, is futile. Many of the TP&rsquo;ers are Christian and try to go into any of their churches and speak about racial truths will get one banned for life.</p>

		<p>White Hispanics or just &#8220;Whiter&#8221; Hispanics are almost always, solidly on our White side and can be counted on, especially to take a very strong, no nonsense line with Blacks, Black criminals.</p>
<p>Whites in Spain fought a 700 year war with invading, occupying Arab Muslim Moors - and the White Spanish side, our side&hellip;</p>
<p>WON! </p>
<p>Full victory - non Whites, Moors expelled from Spain in 1492.</p>
<p>Then Spanish Whites in Spain go off to explore, conquer huge amounts of South America, Cuba etc. The victorious Whites have strong racial polices where only Whites born in Spain could serve in Spanish colonial government - race mixing with attractive Indian women was noticed as a problem.</p>
<p><br>
Throughout the 20th century, no South American nation ever, EVER participated in White vs White World Wars in Europe. Even Leftist Spanish parties, nations like Communist Cuba are very pro White and don&rsquo;t let Blacks cause trouble, get to high.</p>
<p>Blacks in Miami once tried to do their same old urban riots/uprisings over some White Spanish cop killing a Black criminal and the Cuban led government just put down the riots, did offer and concessions like weak WASPs, White libs to here in the States.</p>
<p>Look at the great South American soccer teams from Argentina, Uruguay, Chile - all White and great teams.</p>

		<p>Intent vs. Space.  In go, it is not the control over the territory you sit on but the &#8216;fenceline&rsquo; behind which your assets sit and through which the totality of your own color reigns supreme that matters.  By encompassing that color, you can flipflop control several times until the space is filled.</p>
<p>In chess, it&rsquo;s always the piece itself that matters and ownership of the space it is on requires destructive removal of the prior occupier from the board overall -which becomes more empty- (and thus ripe for new exploitation) as the game moves towards it&rsquo;s conclusion. </p>
<p>I think, going back to at least the manorial period and quite possibly to prehistory, whites have, culturally, known that we are individually at a disadvantage in a group environment due to this very group behavior vs. individual opportunity analogy.</p>
<p>It is also inherent to our sense that &#8216;only another white&rsquo; can truly compete with us because they desire the influence of our surrounding space (without occupation) and will go through us to get control over what we hold in fallow potential.</p>
<p>This is a large part of why Medieval Warfare was a setpiece affair centered around COGs of localized (long line of sight, advantaged traffic choke control for passage tolls) fortification while the population as a whole was largely left out of it since their value was not as a replaceable population group (class as ethnic awareness was much greater obviously) threat as a taxable support base.</p>
<p>At the same time there was a large element of admiration and gratitude for those who -were- able to control a region for a long enough period to establish a stable society, even among those nominally subject to their unwarranted control (i.e. paying of protection racket to one vs. many threats).</p>
<p>This kind of capability to spread out and stake claims that increased the value of a landscape without being a part of the group was lost as Europe filled and the subjugation to authority became absolute and overriding.</p>
<p>It was rediscovered in America where a homesteader could contribute greatly to the value of the nation with his harvest or trade while not being enveloped by the group dynamic of European monarchial despotism as national gaming.</p>
<p>And it is being lost again because, in refusing to fight for the emptiness which makes us stronger in isolation than we are, dominated, as a group-think, we are allowing a pestilential infiltration to confine us and drive us towards extinction.</p>
<p>IMO, it is therefore time to try out the Oriental Strategy of go again.  Not at a national level where &#8216;white power (base)&rsquo; critique is so readily raised as a spectre of racist/nazi excoriation by other, fearful, (herdlike) racial groups.  But rather in small groups.</p>
<p>It never fails to amaze me that we SEE the advantages of a Mexican family bringing 10 people into a 3 bedroom home to fake our lifestyle.  But we will not turn to our neighbor and ask them to help us pay for our mortgage, as we pay for theirs, on a shared, short term, property basis.</p>
<p>As a function of controlling space AS intent.</p>
<p>Three or Four people pulling down 45-75,000 dollars a year can rent out one home, pay off a shared accomodation in another in 2-4 years and then revert to separate families again to pay off the rented unit.</p>
<p>And provided you choose well your initial location as partnerships, nobody can stop that from happening.  Not bank, not government, not employer, not screaming masses.  Because the binding agreements are all internal and private.</p>
<p>It certainly makes more interest level sense to dial up that loan company number which pays off your mortgage in 8 years than it does in 30.  Because in 30 years, this nation won&rsquo;t be here as it is today.</p>
<p>Expand this, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood as a &#8216;covenant selective community environment&rsquo; and whites can regain power in a go-like fashion by connecting fencelines and backfilling with their own color as a way of intent-investing together, privately.  And the way their communities hold common property values, as space, will assure them buying power, by generation.</p>
<p>If we -cannot- manage to cooperate at this local, familiar, level, what strategic goal or function can we possibly achieve at a national, political, one when surrounded by strangers?</p>
<p>Solidarity begins internally with an assumption that you WILL commit to something.  Once you know you are commited to it, your motivation to change it to fit your needs goes up because you know you aren&rsquo;t going to back away from that loyalty.  And can only improve it.</p>
<p>Lacking such a from-within committed attitude is what will keep the 3rd Party and Tea Party organizations from ever amounting to much because they are not reaching out and teaching these kinds of useful partisan skills to build a power base from a grass roots level.</p>
<p>Without gratitude to the organization itself, members are simply too shy of saying how they really feel and seeing whether or not that is what the others are secretly or otherwise there for.</p>
<p>Racial Solidarity will always be radicalized and _fragmented_ when it is not tightly fused, internally.  And that fusion process has to be learned before it can be used.</p>

		<p>#6 - Yours is the kind of post that every &#8220;on-the-fence&#8221; white man and woman should read. A collective white racial awakening will not arise because of any desire for or thoughts of supremacy, but rather from the recognition that we as white people are in very real danger from the relentless race-based attacks of blacks and mestizos and their allies, the left-wing white race traitors. We do not wish to rule other races; on the contrary, we&rsquo;d prefer to be separated from them. We simply want to be able to live our lives and raise our children in peace and with white cultural values.</p>
<p>This increase in white racial awareness that we&rsquo;re beginning to see is also coming about because the hateful, broad-brush attacks coming from the political left are making it virtually impossible to be a moderate conservative. Consider Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. Most people first heard her name when the (often manufactured) outrage over SB 1070 erupted, and many may not know that Gov. Brewer has a fairly moderate political record. In fact, there was a very real fear, not entirely unjustified, that she would veto the bill. The instant she signed it, however, the Left directed a torrent of rage and hatred towards her, calling her a racist and a Nazi, etc. &hellip;the standard liberal rhetoric. She will never go back now, she&rsquo;s on our side for good. If the Left had instead issued a statement like, &#8220;Gov. Brewer, your record shows you are a moderate. Please reconsider your support of this bill&#8221;&hellip;she may well have done just that.</p>
<p>Of course, it goes without saying that I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest in any way that SB 1070 or its supporters are &#8220;extremist&#8221; or out of the mainstream, the quote was simply speculating what rhetoric liberals might use if they had a better grasp of strategy. Indeed, there is a rather hilarious irony in the opponents of a bill that has the support of 70% of Arizonans calling the bill&rsquo;s supporters &#8220;extremist&#8221; and &#8220;out of the mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Left&rsquo;s tactic of using no political mode other than &#8220;Full-On Attack&#8221; on all their opponents, no matter how moderate, has led conservatives to realize that we have nothing to gain by playing nice with our opponents and nothing to lose by standing strong against them. I&rsquo;m an agnostic, but sometimes I do believe that God has blessed us with really stupid enemies.</p>

		<p>On the original subject&hellip;although I don&rsquo;t object to blacks and mestizos participating in the Tea Party, or even to posting profiles of individuals belonging to those groups on the Tea Party website, this pandering to the diversity-mongers is ridiculous. Let&rsquo;s see some profiles of regular white people on the website, I&rsquo;m sure many have interesting stories to tell. And if a black or mestizo Tea Partier is a genuine conservative (as in: not an affirmative action sellout like Colin Powell) and has an interesting story, there&rsquo;s no need to place their profiles in a special section just to show how &#8220;diverse&#8221; and politically correct we are. Also, as someone who&rsquo;s comfortable with her whiteness and comfortable with having part Jewish ancestry on her father&rsquo;s side, that website&rsquo;s separation of Jews from other whites is irritating, to say the least.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Tea Party should be to promote small government, individual liberty, a strong and free America, and the protection of white rights, which are steadily being eroded by the multiculturalists. We should not give a whit about political correctness.</p>
<p>As to the defense of the Tea Party against NAACP accusations of &#8220;racism,&#8221; all we need to do is point out that the Tea Party welcomes anyone who shares their values, while the NAACP, as specified by its own name, exists for the specific purpose of advancing the privileges of one race at the expense of the rights of all the others. &#8220;Who&rsquo;s the real racist&#8221;, &#8220;Clean up your own house&#8221;, etc. would be better things to say than all this diversity-mongering.</p>

		<p>#10 - There are many misguided individuals, including some who post here, who are under the false impression that Spaniards are not &#8220;true whites.&#8221; This charge of not being white enough also sometimes falls upon Portuguese, Italians, Greeks, and Russians, all of whom are as white as you and me.</p>
<p>White unity, folks, not white division. White division is just what our enemies want.</p>
