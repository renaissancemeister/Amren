<h1>France Bans Full Veils in Public</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France-Presse, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The French parliament passed a law Tuesday prohibiting wearing a full-face veil in public, meaning a ban will come into force early next year if it is not overturned by senior judges.</p>
<p>The Senate passed the bill by 246 votes to one and, having already cleared the lower house in July, the bill will now be reviewed by the Constitutional Council, which has a month to confirm its legality.</p>
<p>The text makes no mention of Islam, but President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s government promoted the law as a means to protect women from being forced to wear Muslim full-face veils such as the burqa or the niqab.</p>
<p>Once in force, the law provides for a six-month period of &#8220;education&#8221; to explain to women already wearing a face veil that they face arrest and a fine if they continue to do so in any public space.</p>
<p>A woman who chooses to defy the ban will receive a fine of US$195 or a course of citizenship lessons. A man who forces a woman to go veiled will be fined and serve a jail term.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not about security or religion, but respecting our republican principles,&#8221; Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie declared before the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;France, land of secularism, guarantees respect for all religions (but) hiding the face under a face-covering veil is against public social order, whether it is forced or voluntary,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some other European countries are mulling similar bans, but critics of the law in its proposed form believe it is too broadly framed and that it will eventually be overturned as unconstitutional and discriminatory.</p>
<p>The vote comes when some of France&rsquo;s other policies  &mdash;  especially a drive to round up and expel Roma Gypsies  &mdash;  have led to accusation of racism, and the tough new law is expected to draw further criticism from rights groups.</p>
<p>The policy also has the rare distinction of being condemned in advance by both the United States and Al-Qaeda, with both US President Barack Obama and Islamist militant Ayman al-Zawahiri criticising it as an insult to Muslims.</p>
<p>While Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s determination to halt what some here see as the spread of the use of the niqab won enough votes in parliament, opponents argue it breaches French and European human rights legislation.</p>
<p>The bill defines public space very broadly, including not just government buildings and public transport, but all streets, markets and thoroughfares, private businesses and entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Similar laws are pending in Belgium, Spain and some Italian municipalities, but the ban is particularly sensitive in France, whose often rundown city suburbs are home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Critics say the law exploits a non-problem  &mdash;  only about 1,900 women among France&rsquo;s five to six million Muslims wear a full veil  &mdash;  and panders to anti-Muslim sentiment while distracting from France&rsquo;s economic woes.</p>
<p>Most French Muslims come from France&rsquo;s former colonies in North and West Africa, where wearing the veil is rare, rather than from the Arabian peninsula or Pakistan, where niqabs and burqas are a cultural tradition.</p>
<p>Some Muslim leaders say they support steps to discourage women from wearing the full veil, but that a law would unfairly stigmatise a vulnerable group.</p>
<p>Mindful that a law with a broad scope might be struck down by the European Court of Human Rights, which protects religious freedoms, Mr. Sarkozy&rsquo;s own ruling party asked for the text to be examined by the Constitutional Council.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ban enjoys broad popular support. An international poll conducted in April and May by the Washington-based Pew Research Center found that more than eight in 10 French voters supported a ban.<br>

		<p>Friends who work with addicts (drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc) have told me that their first goal is to get the addict to accept what the key problem is: their addiction. Until they do, cannot begin to control their addiction, and their addiction will continue to control them.</p>
<p>Islamic habiliment is only a symptom; France&rsquo;s problem is massive and alien immigration. Until the French people accept this, France will continue its plunge into oblivion. </p>
<p>I also note France&rsquo;s loss of sovereignty to the EU Human Right court, but apparently the French are indifferent to such minor concerns as loss of sovereignty </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know about France, but in most U.S. locales, wearing a mask in public is against the law unless it is part of a gala event. In NYC for instance.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with John Derbyshire on this one. A constitutional republic such as France really ought not to be in the business of dictating what people wear, within the bounds of commonly understood standards of decency. The problem stems entirely from importing alien cultures whose dress (in this case) is antithetical to the majority culture.</p>
<p>Banning full face veils is treating symptoms, not the problem.</p>

Because the problem is not full-face veils in France but rather the fact that Islam is incompatible with Western culture and tradition, the ban is merely a palliative. It does nothing to cure the disease, which is fatal. <br>

		<p>This sort of thing (banning the veil) is merely tinkering at the edges of the main problem and getting nowhere - fast.  It feeds the deviant Human Rights industry and will probably end up overturned through the lobbying of both Muslims and their Far Left busy-bodying fellow travellers.</p>
<p>What is needed is compulsory repatriation of all Muslims including indigenous converts who must be sent to the Arabian desert if they&rsquo;re refused entry into Muslim lands.</p>
<p>International Human Rights agitators should be arrested and charged with engendering civil unrest, Treason, Sedition and Subversion in a sovereign nation even if it requires the present definitions of Treason, Sedition and Subversion having to be broadened.  </p>
<p>The non-Muslim world should be looking at taking over Islamic nations so that the cult of Islam can be proscribed from within by whatever deterrent methodology found necessary.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s one-child-only policy coupled with enforced sterilization wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad start!<br>

		<p>The easiest way to get rid of an unwanted entity is to persuade it to leave on its own.  Devout Moslems will presumably not want to stay where they can&rsquo;t behave devoutly, and new ones won&rsquo;t want to come to such a place.  <br>
The French have dealt with adversities much greater than a bunch of third-world barbarians who riot in the streets.  </p>

<p>Not a bad count for &#8220;our side&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it definitely was a vote for our side against &#8220;them&#8221; - other, hostile, alien people.</p>

<p>WN in America need to find issues like NW Muslims insulting, oppressing gays and women, non White gangs abusing animals in dog fighting - these issues play well to White liberals, Whites on the Left.</p>

		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t Muslims who wear face veils.  The problem, more simply, is Muslims.  Why are they in France to begin with? </p>

		<p>The French insurance companies are paying quite a bit for the burned cars. Muslims burn somewhere between 100 and 200 cars each and every night all across France. On special festival or riot days the numbers can easily be twice that. Comparing France to the USA, that is equivalent to about 250,000 cars per year.</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Absolutely! There is a strategy that will work.  However, those issues are generally played down or suppressed as being not politically correct. The Left knows very well that this is where they are exposed and defenseless, so they try to evade the whole discussion.</p>

As was stated in the article, less than two thousand women in France actually wear the full veil (<i>le voile intégral</i>). Thus, this is only a palliative being  used to appease the French right in order to draw support away fron LePen and the Front National. It has very minimal significance.</p>
<p>And those few women who do wear the full veil probably will be kept at home and won&rsquo;t be allowed to venture out at all. When I was in Morocco, I was told that there are some women  (many?)  who have NEVER been outside the house.  They are kept ignorant of the outside world. Their husbands do all the shopping and everything else. This will be the fate of those women. Is this helping them?</p>
