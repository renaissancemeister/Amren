			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Boyle, D.C. Daily Caller, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dick Armey&rsquo;s conservative organization FreedomWorks is readying for the launch of a comprehensive political program aimed at debunking the NAACP&rsquo;s race-charged attacks on the Tea Party movement.</p>
<p>FreedomWorks President and CEO Matt Kibbe said the organization will roll out Diverse Tea, a platform and advertising campaign that will showcase diversity in the Tea Party movement, sometime this week or early next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to create a platform for African-American Tea Party leaders, Hispanic Tea Party leaders and Jewish Tea Party leaders to get out there and talk about why they&rsquo;re involved and why these issues matter so much to them,&#8221; Kibbe said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s ironic that the left that so eagerly celebrates the notion of diversity is attacking what I believe to be the most diverse political movement in my lifetime,&#8221; Kibbe said. &#8220;They [the left] are afraid of the Tea Party and, frankly, they&rsquo;re afraid of the diversity of the Tea Party. If you actually take the time to get to know the people in the Tea Party movement, you see an amazing amount of diversity  &mdash;  not just different skin colors but people literally from all walks of life that have united around the idea that the government is too big and is spending too much money it doesn&rsquo;t have.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a part of FreedomWorks&rsquo; overall counter to the NAACP&rsquo;s teapartytracker.org, former Garland, Texas NAACP chapter president and current Tea Party leader, The Rev. C.L. Bryant, is developing a feature-length documentary called &#8220;Runaway Slave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bryant, who left the NAACP because he was upset with what he perceived to be the organization&rsquo;s focus on liberal politics and lack of interest in civil rights, said the film will show viewers how organizations like the NAACP use their clout to keep people under their control. He says he&rsquo;s a &#8220;runaway slave&#8221; in modern terms because he isn&rsquo;t accepting the status quo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kibbe doesn&rsquo;t think the left will ever stop trying to taint the Tea Party movement. If it&rsquo;s not charges of &#8220;racism,&#8221; it&rsquo;ll be something else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism is the latest in a long series of attacks trying to discredit the men and women of the Tea Party movement,&#8221; Kibbe said. &#8220;First, they were &#8216;fake,&rsquo; then they were &#8216;puppets&rsquo; for some corporate interest and, then, when those didn&rsquo;t work and reporters went out and actually started to talk to these folks and realize that they were real and their concerns were real, then they started with the more nasty stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanting the Tea Party to bust their selves in a mad dash to include blacks is exactly what the NAACP wanted.  Dick Armey ios the out-of-touch kind of Republican fool the psychology was aimed at.</p>
<p>Letting a bunch of low I.Q. blacks outsmart him puts himself about as low as he can go.</p>
<p>GET THE REPUBLICANS OUT OF THE TEA PARTY.  They&rsquo;re not clever enough to outfox the left. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The idea is to create a platform for African-American Tea Party leaders, Hispanic Tea Party leaders and Jewish Tea Party leaders-</p>
<p>Then doesn&rsquo;t it make sense to have a &#8216;European-American&rsquo; platform??? I used to be an avid TP fan, but not any more. They&rsquo;ve been subverted by the likes of that snake Dick Armey, [ he always sounds about half drunk whenever I&rsquo;ve heard him speak - like Dean Martin ] the TP is now just another bunch of PC groveling White folks. This snake should&rsquo;ve been booed off the stage every time he showed his face at a TP. We need something along the likes of an &#8216;Awakened White Peoples Party&rsquo;. Dick Armey was the trojan horse, these &#8220;platforms&#8221; are the soldiers!      </p>

		<p>Dick Armey is a fraud.  He believes in amnesty for the illegal aliens as well as dramatic increases in legal immigration.  His group is funded with large donations from wealthy lobbyists that are not in the best interests of the middle class.  HE made millions a year as a lobbyist.  His most passionate beliefs are low taxes for the elite and more &#8220;free trade&#8221; that results in shipping more jobs overseas and larger trade deficits.  He is trying to appoint himself as leader of the tea party.  He has to be resisted and exposed.  Please pass the word that Freedom Works does not represent the true tea party.</p>

		<p>Ron Paul&rsquo;s folks started the &#8220;Tea Parties&#8221; because the first modern Tea Party was Dec. 16, 2007. The Tax Day Tea Party was about frustration toward BOTH parties for the bailouts. But the Parties have been infiltrated by the Republicans and effectively neutered. A wannabe Tea Party leader in my state immediately began trying to appeal to local media to proclaim their diversity at the NAACP chide. I tried to explain that a response is counterproductive but it was to no avail. There are two kinds of Tea Party folks, fiscal conservatives and social conservatives. The problem is the social conservatives are the ones who want to force their idea of &#8220;good and moral behavior&#8221; on others, which is contrary to individual liberty. These are the folks that are always looking around at everyone else for leadership instead of looking within for guidance- the folks that the racism claims really work on. If you are wanting everyone to conform to what you are doing, then you have to look at everyone else. This makes sense to me&hellip;</p>

		<p>I remember when Pelosi and the left accused the TP of being &#8220;astro turf&#8221; instead of real grass roots I thought,  What a load of rubbish!&#8221; But then when I saw some of the neo cons slithering around I thought, &#8220;Maybe she has a point.&#8221; The truth is that the TP really is a grass roots movement. But the neo cons would like to rip it out and replace it with astro turf.</p>

		<p>This shows, once and for all, that the Left defines political discourse in this country.  It is a struggle between Far Left and Left of Center interests.  The legitimate Right (including Race Realist interests) has been completely erased from the conversation.  There is no national organization that can possibly overcome this obstacle&hellip;the Left has truly triumphed in the past 40 years.</p>

		<p>Whoever or whatever is running the TP, they are extremely intelligent to keep it decentralized and to court non-Whites while remaining essentially White because we fight the battles we can win and keeping out non-Whites is the way to lose in the present climate of fear, so there must exist a subtle cohesive awareness among strugling ethnic/racial kin that expedient concessions are not necessarily genuine.</p>

<p>Mr. Armey is pro-criminal alien. Mr. Armey has declared that Tom Tancredo is &#8220;destructive&#8221; to Republicans on immigration.</p>
<p>Mr. Armey is nothing but a opportunist neo-CON(man). You can not have a legitimate tax reform movement that believes in unrestricted illegal immigration or amnesty.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diverse Tea?&#8221; You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. Launching some kind of diversity PR initiative isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call &#8220;fighting back.&#8221; When a self-serving, hypocritical group like the NAACP accuses you of racism, the thing to do is ATTACK THEM, not grovel around at their feet apologizing and bleating about how much you love diversity. Breitbart showed how it&rsquo;s done the last time this happened. They smear you? You smear them right back. That&rsquo;s how politics is played in the real world. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;hard ball&#8221; and whites are going to have to start playing the game if they want to survive. This isn&rsquo;t some kind of intellectual debate. Do you want to be right or do you want to win? Anyway, as far as the Tea Party goes, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that they&rsquo;ve been captured and neutralized by the neocons and nothing serious is ever going to come out of their &#8220;Revolution.&#8221; If the neocons in the Stupid Party team up with the diversity-loving Tea Party to run Sarah Palin for President, we&rsquo;ll be looking at four more years of Barack Hussein Obama. </p>

		<p>The fact that FreedomWorks and the Tea Party movement feel the need to defend themselves against the charge of racism suggests to me that there is little future for a movement that makes overt appeals to hostility against blacks.<br>
 <br>
Black social pathology, and particularly black crime, are legitimate concerns.  These should be discussed candidly and publically even though some try to suppress such discussion as &#8220;racist.&#8221;  <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, there is a difference between criticizing what many in a race do, and hating those in the race because of what they are.  <br>

		<p>The fact of the matter is that most people are race-realists and couldn&rsquo;t care less if the Tea Party is &#8220;racist&#8221; or is accused of being so!  Apparently, Obama&rsquo;s win convinced the loony left that common white people are now politically impotent and that blacks and Hispanics can now be led into voting for an amoral, areligious society.  Republicans who were disgusted with McCain and the establishment and sat out the election are now rallying around the Tea Party or simply realizing that even a lesser-of-evils candidate is better than more of Obama and his far-left cronies.  Usurpers like Armey can try to jump aboard and push any policy they want, but the grassroots don&rsquo;t care what bleeding-heart liberals think of them.</p>

<p>Armey and his flaks are terrifed that the &#8220;racist&#8221; tag will stick to them.  And so the groveling (i.e., search for inclusion and diversity) begins.  They&rsquo;re lobbyists with spin.   </p>
<p>Forget the Tea Partiers and the Glenn Beck brigade, too.  They&rsquo;re astroturf/irrelevant.  Only a BNP-style political movement can protect the U.S. in the long run. </p>

		<p>When ever the liberals bring up racism at the tea party the reply should be AFFRIMATIVE ACTION is what&rsquo;s racist. Also, yes, where are the blacks? Any one can show up, why are they so lazy and apathetic as to not show? We have to play offense and stop always playing defense. I don&rsquo;t care what the other side thinks  &mdash;  they are dishonest. Take it to them, or get out of the way and let the ones that can and will do it.</p>

		<p>14 Anon:</p>
<p>I agree, but in my doing so, I&rsquo;m going to have the Monday morning quarterback the whole Breitbart/NAACP/Sherrod row from many weeks ago.</p>
<p>While I still don&rsquo;t and will never believe that Breitbart deliberately chopped the Sherrod video to make her look bad, (i.e. not showing her &#8220;epiphany&#8221; at first, though later events mostly belie that so-called &#8220;epiphany&#8221;), I will say that, with this hindsight being 20/20, and at the risk of sounding all mafioso and stuff, the hit could have been a lot cleaner and generate a lot less blood splattering back on Breitbart&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Per poster 17 Seek said above, the main problem with the way Breitbart went about this hit is that he fundamentally believes that racism is somehow wrong.  What Breitbart tried to do to defend the TPM from the NAACP resolution at its KC conference calling the TPM &#8220;racist&#8221; (Obama was behind that, mark me), is state that, &#8220;Yes, racism is wrong,&#8221; but &#8220;The NAACP is being racist, too.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s the same kind of dunder-headed response when, e.g. a criminal tries to defend his criminal charges in court by stating that there are other worse criminals.  When he should really do everything he can to convince the jury that he didn&rsquo;t commit the crime.</p>
<p>And the jury&rsquo;s job isn&rsquo;t to judge the criminality of past criminals, it&rsquo;s to judge the current criminal charges against the current defendant, based on whether the prosecution sold the deal.</p>
<p>Best way for the TPM to respond to all these &#8220;racism&#8221; charges?  </p>
<p>Two simple James Edwards words:</p>
<p>Racism Schmacism.</p>

<p>Maybe this classic Yiddish comic style response ought to become the response and campaign against the power and overuse of the word.</p>

		<p>Dick Armey is for illegal immigrant amnesty, and said, &#8220;&hellip; socially conservative Latino and African American voters are natural constituents for the GOP.&#8221;  Two thirds of Hispanics vote for Democrats, and 90% of blacks do.  Also, those &#8220;socially conservative&#8221; Hispanics have a 50% rate of illegitimacy, which looks good only compared to the black rate of 70%.  Armey hasn&rsquo;t the brains of an oyster.  So I assume that Freedomworks is a joke of an organization, and am unsurprised that it is wasting time trying to mollify the NAACP.</p>
