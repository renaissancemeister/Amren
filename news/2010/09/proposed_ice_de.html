<h1>Proposed ICE Detention Policy Change Opposed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Waldman, KGUN-TV (Tucson), September 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Letting illegal immigrants go free? Hard to believe but that could be the new federal mandate if a proposed ICE policy change is approved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the idea: If authorities pull someone over for a traffic stop and discover they are in the country illegally, authorities would be forced to let the illegal immigrant go without calling federal agents unless the individual is a convicted felon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff Tony Estrada of Santa Cruz County says nothing in southern Arizona would change if the detention policy changed. He says that&rsquo;s because his deputies turn these kinds of cases over to Border Patrol anyway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu is very upset about possible policy changes to ICE that read in part, &#8220;Immigration officers should not issue detainers against an alien charged only with a traffic-related misdemeanor unless or until the alien is convicted.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ariz. Sen. Jon Kyl weighed in, along with Texas Sen. John Cornyn, writing this to Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano:</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our review of these memos, we are concerned that these new policies would circumvent, rather than promote the enforcement of, immigration laws pertaining to illegal aliens.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So, not only can illegals from another country who may not speak English, not only can they get a drivers license, when I can&rsquo;t, but they wont have to go to prison either in a situation where I&rsquo;d probably be locked up for committing the same crime. </p>

<p>How soon till there is a social worker or interest group dedicated to helping these entrapped souls avoid conviction? It&rsquo;s probably not that hard. I bet all they have to do is move back to Mexico, or even to another state. Perhaps even a neighboring town would do. I bet there&rsquo;s a social worker there who can tell him what to do. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s official.  Obama&rsquo;s policy on illegal immigration is catch-and-release.</p>

		<p>I live in s.Florida and they have been letting illegal immigrants go since back in the 80&rsquo;s, when ICE was known as INS. An INS agent told me they simply didn&rsquo;t have the resources to deport all the illegals commiting crime. And when some were deported, most would find a way to sneak back in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ex law enforcement and our country has been lying to us for a long time. All this talk of changing ICE policy doesn&rsquo;t mean squat. Does anyone really think with all the budget cuts and our current admin. that ICE is going to enforce deportations? Not a chance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Gov. Brewer scares the feds so bad. She actually might get something done!  </p>

		<p>I firmly believe illegals should be disappeared after being caught.  Just never heard from again.  Gone.  Arrest records disappeared.  All traces disappeared.  The government will deny having ever detained or had custody of them.  No press releases.  No warnings that they may get disappeared. Just gone, like Jimmy Hoffa.  Once word gets out that illegals, when caught, don&rsquo;t get deported, don&rsquo;t get a hearing, they just get disappeared they will start self deporting.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Traffic related misdemeanor&#8221;<br>
It was getting a new drivers license that awoke me to the double standard at play. The man in front of me had no documentaion of any sort so they gave him a simple form to sign. When I got up to the counter I said, &#8220;I forgot my SS card. But I know the mnumber or just give me one of those forms he got.&#8221; The lady sent me home to get it and bring it back for verification. I went into irate mode asking, &#8220;You give him a license without any paper work and then won`t take  me at face value or look up my paperwork?!?&#8221;  I left when the DPS officer began to come around the counter. Which reminded me of the old saying, &#8220;Don`t hate the player, hate the game.&#8221; Frankly, I hate em both!!</p>

		<p>Someone correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t it a felony to present fake documents to obtain a job? Or isn&rsquo;t it a no-no to steal IDs? How about giving a false name? Just what do you have to do to convince the &#8220;law&#8221; that you should be taken into custody and then escorted back across the border posthaste?</p>

		<p>Clearly the US Feds no longer work for the taxpayers.  They confiscate our tax money and throw it away. Laws put in place to protect US are disregarded.  It is revealing to know Feds have given away USA for something else.   I am disturbed by the neglect of public safety deliberately intentionally ignored by officials in highest places.  USA is no longer itself but another entity. </p>
