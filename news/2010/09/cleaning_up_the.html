			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Tea, Wizbang (blog), September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Yesterday, I took a few swipes at the Southern Poverty Law Center. One of my swipes was at their &#8220;Hate Map,&#8221; the interactive web map of the United States that lists those they consider &#8220;hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>I noted that in New Hampshire, they listed one group twice  &mdash;  the Feeneyist &#8220;Slaves Of The Immaculate Heart Of Mary&#8221; in Richmond, NH are listed both under their own name and &#8220;IHM Media.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never heard of the Feeneyites, but my most casual research would indicate they&rsquo;re a Catholic offshoot, a bit of a nutty cult, but not overly dangerous. (OK, they seem really nutty. But as far as I can tell, harmless nuts.)</p>
<p>The other three groups listed as having a &#8220;presence&#8221; in New Hampshire are the Ku Klux Klan, the National Socialist Movement, and North East White Pride. I&rsquo;ve encountered a few of them, so I know they&rsquo;re real, but they&rsquo;re also very small and ineffective.</p>
<p>Bob Owens of Confederate Yankee took a look at how the SPLC rated his own home state of North Carolina. He found they listed 29 groups as active, eight of which were &#8220;black separatist&#8221;  &mdash;  the New Black Panther Party, five chapters of the Nation of Islam, and two chapters of the The Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That seems to be a bit of number-padding  &mdash;  if an organization has multiple chapters in a state, each chapter counts as a separate &#8220;hate group.&#8221; Taking just North Carolina, eliminating duplicates reduces the count from 29 to 18. Taking it a step further, lumping the six variants of the Ku Klux Klan into one would bring it down to 13 total.</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m amazing. In one fell swoop, I&rsquo;ve reduced the numbers of hate groups in North Carolina by 55% without even leaving my chair!</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s two states down, and 48 to go.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that the SPLC, with its remarkable resources (it pays its top ten (white) people an average of about $200,000 a year) could get something as important to them as their &#8220;hate map&#8221; accurate. But they haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s got serious flaws.</p>
<p>But instead of kicking them, let&rsquo;s help them out. Let&rsquo;s do the work they haven&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling on bloggers and blog-readers to go to the SPLC&rsquo;s Hate Map, call up the specifics for their home state, and report on just how accurate it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post semi-regular updates as folks tip me off to their states  &mdash;  preferably in their own blogs, but in e-mails or comments. For this project, I&rsquo;ve set up a fresh e-mail account:</p>
<p>HelpTheSPLC (at) gmail.com</p>
<p>Yeah, I could just kick them around some more, mock them for their sloppy work or even accuse them of hyping and exaggerating the number of &#8220;hate groups&#8221; in the US to boost their fundraising.</p>
<p>Instead, though, I want to be positive. I want to be pro-active. I want to achieve some good, not just slap around the bad.</p>
<p>So head on over to the SPLC&rsquo;s hate map, call up your state, and compare it to reality.</p>
<p>After all, with only two states checked, major flaws have been found in both. The odds are that there are a lot more mistakes in that list.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find &rsquo;em, folks!</p>
