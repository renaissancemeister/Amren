<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39291879/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Cops: Indiana Kids Died After 10 Hours in Closet</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Callahan, MSNBC, September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman charged in the deaths of two of her children told officers she locked them and three siblings inside a closet so she could visit a neighbor, then found the boy and girl dead when she returned about 10 hours later, authorities said.</p>
<p>An Indianapolis police report released Tuesday said Edyan Farah, 28, told officers she &#8220;was not in her right mind&#8221; when she allegedly put the five children in an upstairs closet about 6 a.m. Sunday and placed a bed in front of the door so they couldn&rsquo;t get out. Police said the closet was about 6 feet long and 18 inches deep.</p>
<p>Farah, an immigrant from Somalia, found her 5-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son &#8220;stiff and unresponsive&#8221; when she returned home about 10 1/2 hours later and opened the closet, the report said. She told officers she then carried them downstairs, but did not call 911 or try to revive them, according to the report.</p>
<p>On Monday, Farah was charged with two preliminary counts of neglect of a dependent resulting in death. She remained jailed Tuesday on a $200,000 bond and was scheduled to be formally charged Wednesday, said Julio Fernandez, a spokesman for the Marion County Jail.</p>

		<p>Great parenting. Reminds me of the Ohio woman who taught her two year old to smoke pot. </p>

		<p>I remember discovering &#8216;alternative&rsquo; magazines, about a decade back.  But I quickly realized the were just as much tools of the Mainline Orthodoxy as anything else published today (Amren Excepted, of course).  In my first &amp; LAST copy of either Utne Reader or Mother Jones, I read about how North Dakotans were (supposedly) enthusiastically welcoming Somalians as neighbors, because of all the FAMILY VALUES North Dakotans and Somalians had in-common.</p>
<p>Yes.  Oh, yes!  And it seems now that the people of Indiana are being treated to displays of Somalian Family Values.</p>
<p>Positively heart-warming!  By the way: are there any of the Ik People still alive?  You know?  The ones who put their children out at age three to fend for themselves&hellip;and if they returned home, they were walled-in and allowed to starve to death?  America could be enriched by those Family Values, too.</p>

		<p>I have read so many stories of blacks killing, abusing, torturing their children that it far outweighs the few Whites who have done the same. But watch for blacks and self-hating Whites to bring up Susan Smith again&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Is the distraught mom from Somalia a &#8220;legal&#8221; immigrant? If so, how? If not, why is she breeding and killing kids without the bothersome ICE shipping her back to her homicidal, dysfunctional &#8220;nation&#8221;?  I doubt this Administrtion deports anyone back to Africa. It hits home a bit too much, don&rsquo;t you think? </p>

		<p>Thinking about this, I was at first baffled that someone would die after ten hours in a closet, since these are not airtight, but further reflection produced the following: assuming a standard ceiling of 8 feet or so, we have the volume of this 6 feet by 18 inches closet at 72 cubic feet.  Even though the closet door would not have produced an airtight seal, this is a small space for five (!) people, and not enough fresh make-up air would have been coming in under and around the door to prevent a lethal carbon dioxide buildup.</p>
<p>The article also said the children appeared malnourished; this mother&rsquo;s parenting skills appear to be nonexistent.  It&rsquo;s a wonder she had five who lived even this long.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t these people believe in birth control?  If they don&rsquo;t want to be parents, they shouldn&rsquo;t have kids.  I am sure that some do gooder organization would be willing to pay for this woman to get her tubes tied.  Why not, they give them money for everything else.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, a few thousand remain, but I doubt there are many &#8220;in the wild&#8221;.  I suspect Uganda quietly broke up their settlements so Western reporters wouldn&rsquo;t follow up after the story came out.  </p>
<p>That book on the Ik People - <i>The Mountain People</i> by Colin Turnbull - was the most horrible thing I&rsquo;ve ever read.  It literally gave me nightmares.  It still boggles my mind that any group of people, even Africans, could be so <i>routinely evil</i> to their own children!  </p>
<p>I highly recommend that book to any liberal who believes the old &#8220;Noble Savage&#8221; myth.  There is absolutely no excuse for that pure evil, and it had nothing to do with Whites or Colonialism or Globalization.  Colin Turnbull made all sorts of excuses for them, but it was obvious from the book that he instinctively hated them (as would any decent person).  </p>
<p>From &#8216;Anthropology Today&rsquo; (sited by Wikipedia):<br>
<i>Consequently Turnbull advocated to the Ugandan government forcible relocation of random tribal members (with no more than ten people in any relocated group).</i><br>
