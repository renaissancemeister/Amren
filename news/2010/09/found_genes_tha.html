			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Leake, The Australian (Sydney), September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SCIENTISTS have identified more than 200 genes potentially associated with academic performance in schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Those schoolchildren possessing the &#8220;right&#8221; combinations achieved significantly better results in numeracy, literacy and science.</p>
<p>The finding emerged from a study of more than 4000 British children to pinpoint the genes and genetic combinations that influence reasoning skills and general intelligence.</p>
<p>One of its main conclusions is that intelligence is controlled by a network of thousands of genes with each making just a small contribution to overall intelligence, rather than the handful of powerful genes that scientists once predicted.</p>
<p>The researchers believe their work could eventually lead to genetic tests to predict babies&rsquo; academic potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kind of research could help us develop genetic tests to predict which kids are at risk of developing problems with their schooling, so that we could intervene to help them,&#8221; said Robert Plomin, professor of behavioural genetics at the Institute of Psychiatry at King&rsquo;s College London, who will describe his work today at a meeting of the Royal Society.</p>
<p>In his research, Professor Plomin built up a database on the academic ability of 4000 children, partly from teacher assessments and partly by having the youngsters sit a battery of cognitive tests. Then he and his colleagues analysed the children&rsquo;s DNA, looking for tiny variations in their genes.</p>
<p>There are potentially many millions of these variations, but the team restricted their search to looking at the million or so of the most common, to find out which gene variants were most frequently found in children with either a high or low level of academic achievement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the gene variants we looked at, a couple of hundred are emerging which seem to have a small but significant relationship with ability in maths and English,&#8221; said Professor Plomin.</p>
<p>Such research reflects a long-term trend away from the idea that particular aspects of human physiology, appearance and behaviour are controlled by just a few genes.</p>
<p>This idea arose from early breakthroughs in which illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and breast cancer, or features such as hair and eye colour, were found to be strongly influenced by variations in the structure of just one or a few genes. Some scientists then predicted similar results for anything from heart disease to intelligence.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, it has become clear that most aspects of human development, health and behaviour are controlled by huge networks of individual genes, of which humans have about 25,000.</p>
<p>Research into height, for example, has picked out 300 genes that affect how tall people will grow, but even these genes can only explain 15 per cent of the total variations in human height. It implies that hundreds more genes must also play a part.</p>

		<p>Obviously, genes are raciss.  Look for calls to mandate genetic testing on all Whites, and those with the smart gene will be sent to the anti-raciss gulag for training in self hatred. The will all &#8220;atone for the the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privlege.  We didn&rsquo;t earn our privileged genes, therefore, we owe all the benefits thereof to the people of color, whom we have wronged to too long by oppression and marginalization.  We will only allow blacks to breed with us, so that we can share our genes in a more just and equitable manner.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I predict that this research will be declared &#8220;Nazi,&#8221; denounced by the press and &#8220;civil rights groups,&#8221; and quickly flushed down the memory hole. The marxist establishment will not allow intelligence to be correlated with genetics.<br>

		<p>Shall I point out the elephant in the room here? Nary a time did they mention race in these studies. Four thousand British children could mean anything. I&rsquo;m sure if they did find a difference in genes between the races, they wouldn&rsquo;t dare publish it. I&rsquo;m sure none of them fancy losing their jobs.</p>

		<p>Months ago there was an article alluding to this in the magazine &#8220;The Economist&#8221;.  This article was mentioned here on AmRen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1109437" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1109437</a></p>
<p>The author predicted, among other things, there would be embarrassing revelations about who holds the short end of the intelligence stick, genetically speaking.  He also predicted this technology would be meaningless here in Fabian Socialist America, though countries like China would make great use of it.  Sadly, he&rsquo;s probably correct.</p>
<p>Racially and eugenically conscious Whites in this country need to network, and fast, because this country (in its present form, anyway) is due for a fall.</p>

In the future, if gene therapy ever pans out, you can be sure that the people who insisted that there was no connection between genes and intelligence are going to be the ones demanding that blacks are at the head of the line.</p>

		<p>Studies like these will help correct wobbly thinking of equality.  Our legal guarantee of equality has moved from equal rights to equal results.  The former a legal concept of an operating environment, the later what is produced by individuals in that environment.  Clearly we all come with different abilities, and clearly we do different things with those abilities should we chose.  Spending large quantities of money to provide a college track for those with sub-normal IQs has poor returns to society.  Of course this will take time as genetic testing might not show the kindest results for certain groups.</p>

		<p>When it becomes possible to predict the intelligence of a new born baby The Bell Curve will be proven.  Those who have ideological reasons for denying what the book says will continue to pretend that they disagree.  Their arguments may even become more hysterical.  Fewer people will pay attention to them.  Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein will be recognized as two of the greatest political scientists in American history.  </p>

		<p>It was pounded into my head (without success) that &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who your family WAS. What matters is who you are TODAY&#8221;.  I was not, however, a stupid child, and did not believe that &#8220;We&rsquo;re All Equal&rsquo; rubbish for one moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d read too much literature predating The Statue of Liberty, to be ignorant of the fact that over all the preceding millennia of Human History, family and bloodlines did SO matter.  Where heritable traits are concerned, the past is an awfully good predictor of the future.</p>
<p>Certain last names could easily suggest the possibility that a devastatingly dashing beau might become a drunken, wife-beating, lout of a husband, apt to gamble away the family land.  Other surnames and ancestral lines (and countries of origin) would indicate a good chance that a suitor would be a diligent worker, a kind and temperate spouse, and a wise planner.</p>
<p>Intelligence is entangled among all manner of other heritable traits.  Who knows where physique stops and the mind begins?  And if you view the individual as a whole package, some packages are clearly more viable than others. The tendency for that viability to be passed from one generation to the next has been assumed knowledge since time unknown.</p>
<p>It is ludicrous for anyone to present it as news, that intelligence is heritable and complex.  Geneticists have known this for as long as the science of Genetics has existed.  And before we knew there were Genes, we had other ways of knowing the same things.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: the results of this study will, as other posters have noted, disappear into obscurity, just as surely as have the results of all the other studies.</p>

		<p>Is it an implication of this research that uplifting IQ via<br>
genetic engineering is a far far more distant possibility than<br>
formerly supposed?   </p>
