<p>Unlike the U.S. mainland, failing to register as a sex offender in Puerto Rico is only a misdemeanor, not a felony. There are also no laws on the island that prevent convicted child molesters from living near schools or parks.</p>
<p>According to Puerto Rico police Capt. Margarita George, around six convicted sex offenders come to the island every month and register with the police.</p>
<p>But what the AP failed to report is what may be the main draw for U.S. child molesters to move to the Carribean paradise .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the age of sexual consent in Puerto Rico is only 14-years of age!</p>
<p>The following is a list of countries that have an age of sexual consent of 14 or lower (where indicated):</p>
<p>-Albania<br>
-Bulgaria<br>
-Chile<br>
-China<br>
-Colombia<br>
-Ecuador<br>
-Estonia<br>
-Hungary<br>
-Italy<br>
-Liechtenstein<br>
-Lithuania<br>
-Mexico (12)<br>
-Moldova<br>
-Montenegro<br>
-Nigeria (13)<br>
-Peru<br>
-Serbia<br>
-South Korea (13)<br>
-Spain (13)<br>
-Syria (13)<br>
-Vatican (12)<br>
-Zimbabwe (12)</p>
<p>Most Muslim countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia have no age of consent law, as it is illegal to have sexual relations outside of marriage. However, these countries allow adult males to &#8220;marry&#8221; multiple women, and very young girls.<br>

		<p>A pedophile is someone who is sexually attracted to children who have not attained puberty.</p>
<p>Someone who is attracted to adolescents who have not achieved adulthood is not considered a pedophile.</p>
<p>In the USA, some states have laws against adultery. However, adulterers are very seldom prosecuted. There aren&rsquo;t any laws against men pretending to love a woman to get her in bed, then leaving her when he gets bored. But if a man wants to marry a 14 or 15 year old girl, he is a sexual predator for life. Go figure.</p>

		<p>Kevin MacDonald argues that one of the distinquishing <br>
features of Western Civilzation is life long monogamy and more<br>
or less equality between man and wife. This is not the case<br>
in Africa, or Muslim society where one man may have<br>
a half dozen wives he visits occasionally and many children he<br>
barely knows. Osama Bin Laden for instance is one of 58 children by one man. In the West Life long marriage of adults and small<br>
families of  one or two children<br>
allows the devotion and nuture that produces highly individualized and emotionally developed children who are also <br>
guided through an longe educational process. Even these basic<br>
norms of Western Civilization are missing from most of the world<br>
and we should never forget just how different the West is from<br>
The Rest.</p>

		<p>I agree with the first comment. Pedophilia is the act of sex with a pre-pubescent child. While it&rsquo;s wrong for an adult to have sex with an emotionally immature girl, the age limit is arbitrary. An 18 year old can be just as incapable of having a responsible sexual relationship. Age of consent laws are partly designed to prevent older men from taking advantage of younger, more immature females, but more so to allow girls to finish their education, where in the past girls were regularly married by age 14. The laws are designed to promote gender equality.</p>
<p>If society actually considered it immoral for teens to engage in sex, then we should charge teens with a crime if they committed it. And we&rsquo;d prevent teen girls from wearing sexually explicit clothing as well.</p>

		<p>A child that has not attained puberty has also not achieved adulthood.  You have some nice sociological definitions there but in Texas the law defines the age of consent.  Adulthood is the age of majority.  It doesn&rsquo;t affect the laws of consent.</p>
<p>Stay out of Texas.  We protect our children.  We still run chain-gangs down here and chain is real cheap.</p>
<p>We NEVER run out of it.</p>

		<p>Canada&rsquo;s age of consent was 14, until very recently.  2008, I believe.  My father&rsquo;s mother had her first child at 14 (in Germany). </p>
<p>Also, a cutoff of 13 in Korea is probably different than a cutoff of 13 in an African country, as sexual maturity is reached earlier with Africans.</p>

		<p>Would be interesting to see the same country&rsquo;s drug laws. Lax or strict if caught abusing drugs? It may simply be a matter of keeping young men out of the (expensive to maintain) criminal justice system. Or a matter of keeping ordinary citizens from turning against their government. </p>

<p>NINE years old and a young girl can be married in Iran. One of the first things Khomeini did when he assumed power was to lower the age by which a girl can get married to nine years. That is from the example of Mohammad who married Aisha when she was nine. [Moe actually married Aisha when she was six but waited until Aisha was nine before he &#8220;knew&#8221; her!].</p>
<p>For a long time too Haiti was a &#8220;Pedophile Paradise&#8221;. Gay whitey from San Francisco found out they could travel to Haiti for vacation and &#8220;buy&#8221; a young boy for a week, the cost being about ten dollars! And do to that young boy whatever they wanted as well.</p>

		<p>Most Latin American countries celebrate Quinceañera  &mdash;  a girl&rsquo;s 15th birthday which symbolizes her transition from girl to woman. As the young Spanish prostitute La Dolciquita says in THE GOOD SOLDIER (1915)  &mdash;  &#8220;We Spanish women are horrors at 30.&#8221; Almost 100 years later this still rings true&hellip;the main reason why their men tag them while they&rsquo;re teenagers.</p>

<p>The requirement for girls in muslim law before sexual relations is that they must reach puberty first.  If a guy marries a girl who has not reached puberty, he must wait until she has even if she doesn&rsquo;t reach it until she&rsquo;s a teenager.  Most societies of the past have followed this tradition to one degree or another.  Minimum ages for marriage among europeans are a recent phenomenon.  In this country there are a couple of states that only recently changed marriage age for girls from 12 to 14.  In the 1800s girls could get married even at 9-10 years old in the Old West.  Don&rsquo;t forget the mote in our own eye!</p>

Biologically speaking, once you reach puberty, you&rsquo;re ready for sex.</p>
<p>The questions we ask as a society are are young kids emotionally prepared for the consequences of sex and are they vulnerable to physical and emotional &#8216;predators&rsquo; who can use their sexual sophistication to manipulate young kids?</p>

		<p>So No. 8,  14 and 15 year old girls are too young to marry and any one claiming otherwise is a sexual predator? The highly successful Roman Empire would disagree since the average age of marriage was 14. What is acceptable in terms of what actually works for humanity is simply different at times from what is acceptable in terms of a societies &#8220;moral&#8221; outlook. Indeed I would bet that had not early man and women joined in union at that age we wouldn&rsquo;t even be here given their average life span of less than 30 years.</p>

		<p>I believe that Korea has raised the age of consent to 18 or 19 for girls.</p>
<p>Age is revered in Korea, generally people are one year younger than their stated age. Hence the old limit of 13 would have been 12 by Western reckoning.</p>
<p>Due to Korea&rsquo;s  newfound wealth from industries, few or no families are hard up enough to sell their females any longer. Most marry in their 20s.</p>
<p>The Philippines should be somewhere on the above list shouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>One minor correction.</p>
<p>The age of consent in Mexico is set by the individual Mexican states as well as the Federal Mexican Government. Lower Baja (Sur) has an age of consent of 12, as do a few others, some are 15, some 16, and some 18. You can be prosicuted FEDERALLY for anything under 18 (a good thing IMO).</p>
<p>More here: <a href="http://bit.ly/bSpZ2j" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/bSpZ2j</a></p>
<p>Mostly those laws state in some areas (Mexican states?) you can marry a 12-year-old.</p>
<p>Mostly those are arranged in rural areas and are not entirely looked upon favorably by the Federals in Mexico, but they tend to turn a blind eye to the practice by the locals.</p>

		<p>While I do not argue with the idea that immaturity can lead to marital disaster isn&rsquo;t it also true that young people are maturing physically much earlier than a century ago?<br>
I think we here in the USA had better do a cultural critique. Because of enhanced diet, lax sexual mores, and media frenzy, anyone can see a sexualization of life by junior high for many young people. Young females wear low revealing shirts at age 13, and are fully developed by then. <br>
I don&rsquo;t understand the hyped-up Puritanism of certain posters here. If we have learned one thing, it is that &#8220;tough laws&#8221; simply make life tough for some, but don&rsquo;t fundamentally change behavior.<br>
Pedophilia seems to me to be perhaps a genetically linked predisposition. It is a constant in human life.</p>

		<p><i>Canada&rsquo;s age of consent was 14, until very recently.</i></p>
<p>That was the age of consent here for most of our history (14 is the common law age of consent) and it remained so in Mississippi until the late &rsquo;90s. </p>
<p>Here in Arizona, the <i>de facto</i> age of consent is 15. (The law states 18 in most circumstances, but there&rsquo;s a loophole that makes it all but impossible to get a conviction if the girl is at least 15.) </p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia, Mexican consent laws vary a bit, depending on which state you&rsquo;re in; they seem to vary between 12 and 14.  The national age of consent in Japan is (not mentioned above) is 13, but prefecture laws usually raise this (and again, it varies).  At the other extreme, in Tunisia the cutoff age is 20. (!)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a guy. When I was 15, an adult female counselor at summer camp seduced me. It was a good experience and totally consensual. If I had a 15 year old daughter I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;d be pleased if the equivalent happened to her, but sexuality is such a charged subject it&rsquo;s difficult to discuss it objectively. I suspect that at least some of the laws that designate 14 as the age of consent are in place to prevent 18 year old boyfriends from getting locked up and have caveats to specify this.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous (re Post # 8):</p>
<p>I disagree with you. If an adult man wanted to marry a 14 or 15-year old girl - legally of course - he should be able to do so. He would have to get parental consent, or, if the girl is an orphan, or runaway, a court decree allowing him and her to marry. In the latter cases, if marriage will improve the life of a minor girl who is an orphan or a runaway, then why not?</p>
<p>They give Olympic medals out to girls age 14, 15, and 16, as well as abortions in some cases, but they won&rsquo;t allow these girls to marry older men? That&rsquo;s stupid. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that after seizing the reigns of power from the Shah, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini legalized &#8216;medical transexualism&rsquo; (though he made male homosexuality a crime punishable by death).  As of 2008, Iran leads the world in sex-change operations (after Thailand).  The government is even willing to foot up to half the cost of the operation!</p>

		<p>There is a lot of conversation in here about ridiculously low ages of consent in some American state laws.  But a word of warning   &mdash;   Those aren&rsquo;t always as they appear.  For instance, Missouri&rsquo;s AOC is 14.  BUT&hellip;it&rsquo;s not that easy.  MO law defines stat rape as sex with anyone under 14, OR sex with someone under 17 if you&rsquo;re at least 21.  So, 14 is ONLY the AOC if the other party is 14-20 years old.  Full AOC is 17.  </p>
<p>Other states that have low AOCs have age differential stipulations for younger teenagers.  For instance, the AOC could be 14, but if you&rsquo;re 14-17, then the other party has to be no more than 3 years older, and the full AOC is 18.  Meaning that 50 year old can&rsquo;t touch 14-17 year old.</p>
<p>What makes MO law strange is that if 20-yo meets 14-yo, and have sex, that&rsquo;s legal.  But when they both turn a year older, it&rsquo;s stat rape.  And for the year after that.</p>
<p>Also, some states that have seemingly high AOC, like Arizona&rsquo;s 18, also have loopholes that make it impossible to prosecute stat rape unless the victim is under 15, and the reason for that is the Quinceañera thing poster 9 mentioned   &mdash;   Start prosecuting every Hispanic for doing a 15-17 y.o. young woman, and the Raza types would throw a fit and whine about &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; and &#8220;cultural insensitivity.&#8221;  </p>

<p>I disagree with you. Old people are likely to die a lot sooner - where the taxpayer must then support the surviving spouse with social security.  Youngsters don&rsquo;t always have good judgment. That&rsquo;s why we protect them up to 18 years of age and in some cases up to 21 years of age or even older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a separate issue&hellip; but it might not be fair to 14 year old boys if 14 year old girls are being married off to 25 year old or older dudes. </p>

		<p>The moral relativity of the vast majority of the posters here, is what worries me, more than supposed &#8216;ages of consent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We speak of older eras where mature men would wed younger girls, and consider it to be &#8216;cradle robbing,&rsquo; but: as a woman&rsquo;s sexual peak is in the early twenties, and men can procreate until quite elderly, when abortion and homosexuality were not &#8216;lifestyle choices,&rsquo; marriage of a young girl was the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>But then, adulterers, and prostitutes were publically stoned in those eras, as well. In other words, societal MORALITY (whether pagan or O.T. Mosaic) was the crucible that put it (april/september marriage) into proper perspective.<br>
 <br>
To relate this to a very specific case, many biblical commentators consider that the Blessed Virgin Mary was not much more than 14 or 15 when the Angel Gabriel made his momentous visit.</p>
<p>But we do not live in such a moral society, today. Also, we keep adolescents little more than children as long as we can, while society wants them to be &#8216;sluts in training&rsquo; as young as 12. THAT is perverse, and that is why many here (including me) find the idea of  ANY man marrying a child, morally and societally repulsive.</p>
<p>Until and unless society allows morals once more to be the framework through which social actions take place, this way of looking at sexual relations is invalid, and immoral. for &#8216;righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.&rsquo; Prov. 14:34 </p>

		<p>Not too long ago here in Maryland, there was a case of a 17 year old female student having an affair (repeated consensual sex) with one of her high school teachers. Charges were brought against the teacher and he was put in jail. I agree that in that professional setting a sexual relationship is inappropriate and distracting but besides that, what is wrong with it? I was appalled to see the comments about the alleged crime   &mdash;   &#8220;That poor girl, that man took advantage of her! He VIOLATED her!&#8221; etc. It was unbelievable but so representative of how our society is today. There is hysteria over &#8220;pedophilia&#8221; even though the perceived &#8220;victims&#8221; are usually sexually mature. It sickens me to think that my grandfather, bless his soul, would have been considered a pedophile by today&rsquo;s standards. He was 21 when he met my 14 year old grandmother. They had to get married in Kentucky because she was so young. A year later, she had my uncle, then my mom, then two more boys. They were happily married for 50+ years&hellip;. </p>

		<p><i>Most Muslim countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia have no age of consent law, as it is illegal to have sexual relations outside of marriage. However, these countries allow adult males to &ldquo;marry&rdquo; multiple women, and very young girls.</i></p>
<p>Yes the law allows up to 4 wives BUT most all women require a marriage contract and those contracts typically state, among other things, the first wife will be the ONLY wife. I am sure the peasants and uneducated do not insist on that, but the educated women in those countries always do. Islamic scholars believe Mohammeds first wife in the 600&rsquo;s had such a contract, which is likely why he only took multiple wives after her death.</p>
<p>Also the age of consent in Georgia was 14 up until 12 years ago or so.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I disagree with you. If an adult man wanted to marry a 14 or 15-year old girl - legally of course - he should be able to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, girls who are 14 or 15 are too young and immature to get married just like they are too immature to drink or vote. People forget that back in history, the life expectancies were much lower, such as the 30s, so people married much younger because they didn&rsquo;t live long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too long ago here in Maryland, there was a case of a 17 year old female student having an affair (repeated consensual sex) with one of her high school teachers. Charges were brought against the teacher and he was put in jail. I agree that in that professional setting a sexual relationship is inappropriate and distracting but besides that, what is wrong with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Teachers are in a position of authority or power, the 17 year old may be perfectly willing but he is taking advantage and should go to jail.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand the hyped-up Puritanism of certain posters here. If we have learned one thing, it is that &ldquo;tough laws&rdquo; simply make life tough for some, but don&rsquo;t fundamentally change behavior.<br>
Pedophilia seems to me to be perhaps a genetically linked predisposition. It is a constant in human life.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with Puritanism but everything to do with immorality and I don&rsquo;t understand how some on here can condone older men sleeping with 14-16 year olds. Face it, it IS immoral for a 25 or 40 year old or whatever to sleep with a 14 or 15 year old. These girls are not old enough to use good judgement that is why they can&rsquo;t drink, vote, sign a legal contract or marry. I don&rsquo;t care what two consenting adults do in their own bedroom or what two people who have reached the age of consent do but we are not talking about adults here and we have to legally draw the line somewhere. Laws against theft make it tough for thieves but too bad, should we not have laws against theft? Also, I don&rsquo;t believe pedophelia is &#8220;genetic&#8221;, it&rsquo;s a choice made by those that are EVIL.</p>

		<p>Actually, the age of consent in most states was 14 until the last 10 or 15 years or so, so I don&rsquo;t think any of this is much of a deal. I largely agree with the first comment. Speaking of &#8220;go figure,&#8221; the age of consent in Pennsylvania is graduated, like income tax. If a 20 year old has sex with a 16 year old, it&rsquo;s okay. But if a 21 year old does, he gets labeled a sexual predator for the rest of his life. This is nuts. Government has no business being involved in &#8220;morality&#8221; anyway. A flat 14 age of consent seems to make sense. We put 21 year old guys in jail and ruin their lives for often times doing what comes &#8220;naturally.&#8221; And though I&rsquo;m generally to the right of center, this raising the age of consent and all the stuff that came with it was an outgrowth of the Rise of the Right. It&rsquo;s caused more problems than it&rsquo;s worth.  </p>
