<h1>Poll: 65% of Texans Want Immigration-Enforcement Law Like Arizona&rsquo;s</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ross Ramsey, Texas on the Potomac, September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly half of all Texans would repeal the constitutional promise of citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil, and nearly two-thirds would favor Arizona-style state laws allowing the police to ask about the immigration status of anyone they stop for any reason, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants so-called birthright citizenship to babies born in this country regardless of the immigration status of their parents. Asked whether that provision should be repealed, 48 percent of respondents say yes, while 38 percent say no. The remaining 14 percent are undecided. Fifty-four percent of respondents &#8220;strongly favor&#8221; passing a Texas law mirroring Arizona&rsquo;s controversial new immigration law, and another 11 percent &#8220;somewhat support&#8221; passage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most Texas politicians have danced around immigration policy, not committing on the 14th Amendment and giving tepid responses on the Arizona law, saying they like elements of it but would have to see a proposal before taking a position. {snip}</p>
<p>Immigration and the economy dominate Texans&rsquo; answers to questions about the most-important issues.</p>
<p>They rank the importance of issues facing the country this way: the economy, 31 percent; unemployment/jobs, 17 percent; political corruption/leadership, 12 percent; federal spending/national debt, 11 percent; immigration, 5 percent. Their answers on the state level have a different focus: border security, 20 percent; immigration, 18 percent; unemployment/jobs, 14 percent; the economy, 12 percent; and political corruption/leadership, 9 percent.</p>

		<p>Good, but&hellip;Rick Perry has already said that he would veto a bill like SB 1070 if one got to his desk.  He&rsquo;s been amnesty and open borders for as long as I&rsquo;ve known about him.  Kathy Medina is a doctrinaire conservative who doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;get&#8221; race (she was against E-Verify).  Least risky bet in that primary was Kay Bailey Hutchinson, she was for E-Verify, so I figure she would have been most likely to sign SB 1070 like laws as Governor.  Which is why she would have gotten my vote.</p>

		<p>But they won&rsquo;t get it.  When has Texas ever called a state convention to investigate and hold accountable Federal employees who exercise powers over Texans that Texas never delegated to the Fed. Government?  They&rsquo;ve never held anyone accountable for the Integration disaster and the open borders crisis, so don&rsquo;t expect them to do anything but complain some, then less, then only among themselves, then keep quiet for fear of being called &#8220;raciss&#8221;.  </p>
<p>You all know how the game is played.  Can you send your precious White child to an all White public school?  Can you pursue happiness in your own White neighborhood without constant fear that HUD will give Section 8 vouchers to the ghetto and help them all move next door to you?</p>
<p>Texas talks and carries nothing but a big despair.</p>

		<p>As a resident of Texas (since 2005, but still), I can say that I am truly &#8220;proud to be a Texan&#8221; on hearing this. I only hope that our politicians will listen to the people on this one, and with the Tea Party movement doing so well around the country, it seems our politicans will have no choice but to submit to the will of the people, if only to retain their positions.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if this comment is not exactly on topic, but this topic will never come up, and it does have to do with illegal aliens, so I would like to throw it in now.</p>
<p>First of all, I am completely in favor of each and every law that is intended to turn down the flow of illegals (sorry, NAHJ), however, I don&rsquo;t think these laws will have an immediate effect. In the meantime, used toilet paper will continue to pile up on public and business bathroom floors all over the country. </p>
<p>I am not one to point out a problem without offering a solution, so here is my solution: Litter known &#8220;coyote&#8221; paths and Home Depot parking lots with flyers that have a semi-nude picture of Selma Hayek on the front and a note on the back that explains that it is OK to flush used toilet paper down the toilet in America. <br>
This may sound like a joke, but the illegals&rsquo; habit of not flushing toilet paper, which stems from using Mexican toilets connected to clay tiles that do not have the proper drain pitch, poses a serious health threat in areas heavily frequented by invaders from south of the border.</p>
<p>I admit that the Selma flyer idea might be a little bit insane, but I really would like for somebody to get the word out to our wonderful undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>I suppose that you liberals who poke around this sight looking for trouble thought it was inbred racist rednecks who have been leaving that mess.</p>

		<p>You cannot &#8220;repeal&#8221; the Constitutions guarantee of <br>
&#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; because the Constitution<br>
says no such thing. The 14th Amendment was passed<br>
to give citizenship to former slaves..and it specifically<br>
says.&#8221;those with legal presence&#8221; in the country.<br>
Have you ever wondered why the Pro Illegal/Amnesty<br>
groups have never taken this issue to the Supreme Court?<br>
Not once? Because they know that in any open court based<br>
on law&hellip;they will LOSE.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is DESPITE massive brainwashing and demoralization!</p>
<p>&#8220;You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can&rsquo;t fool all of the people all of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that ending birthright citizenship is even catching &#8220;mainstream&#8221; airwaves is  GOLDEN SIGN.  Keep in mind that most (all) news and opinion is completely manufactured for consumption.  This is an example of -true- popular consensus bubbling up through the murky swamp of political correctness!</p>
<p>Stay on message, White people.  Don&rsquo;t argue, make a point.  Don&rsquo;t defend, attack.</p>

		<p>As an older native Texan;I can say this, Texans have had enough of the Third World experience. Here in Texas we have ourselves a new system of checks and balances, The Tea Party. We are already witnessing the great RINO hunt and I&rsquo;m certain that Perry is aware of this. One would have to be foolish to believe that he doesnt have future Presidential aspirations. The Republican Party is being cleansed of liberals and moderates and in the end it will be a matter of what the Tea Party demands, not what any politician wants. Perry did in fact say that he would not sign any bill which mirrored Arizona&rsquo;s. He said that during an election year without sampling polls. As Texas&rsquo; demographics change, so will it&rsquo;s politics and it would be political suicide for the GOP in Texas to allow itself to become numerically inferior to a pack of Hispanic and Black Democrats. Can you imagine the 34 electoral votes lost by the GOP if Texas were to turn blue?. Aint gonna happen. Give Perry a little more credit for having a set, he does. We will thin our herd. I only hope that when he does he deports every Liberal Democratic Californian (Not all Californians, just the Hippies)that has moved here along with them. They are an equal threat to my Red State.</p>

		<p>No. 1 at 7:02&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you talking about Debra Medina?  Who is Kathy Medina?</p>
<p>I consider Kay Bailey Hutchinson and John Cornyn (sp?) to be nothing more than Obama Republicans.  Governor Good Hair is an open borders guy.  All of these are bad news.</p>

		<p>I live in a small mountian town in northen Orgon,about an hour away for Portland.To state a fact,about 60-70% of our 3,700 citizens are armed;and we take a dim view of not only illegals,but also non Nordic-Germanic types in general.<br>
Oregon is tryin&rsquo; to put together its own law,the only difference being that lawful citizens have the right to stop suspected border-jumpers on their own athority and deal with them as the situation dictats.WE THE PEOPLE,will no longer take in the huddled masses of the world&hellip;</p>

		<p>Perry, Hutchinson, and Medina never had any intentions of shutting down the border. Perry is hispandering to the illegals and eventually trying to run for President. Hutchinson is a liberal. And Medina, while conservative, didn&rsquo;t get the White man&rsquo;s stance on illegals. The one I&rsquo;m voting for is the Libertarian candidate, even though it is a woman. Haha, I heard Bill White the other day on talk radio say that under his administration that Houston was not a sanctuary city, and if he became governor that Texas would not be a sanctuary state. I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing at this guy.</p>

		<p>8:  My bad.  You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>KBH was no angel, but my point was that she was marginally less risky than Perry or Medina.  She still might have vetoed SB 1070 style laws, but of the three, I think she was most likely to sign them.  Perry has already said no, and Medina was too worried about the &#8220;libertarian&#8221; consequences.</p>

		<p>As much as I would like to believe that almost almost 2 out of 3 people in the once great state of Texas support such measures, I find it extremely difficult to believe.  Texas - along with California - has the &#8220;distinction&#8221; of being a &#8220;White minority&#8221; state, so  it would be almost impossible now for a strong majority to support border enforcement and immigration laws.</p>
