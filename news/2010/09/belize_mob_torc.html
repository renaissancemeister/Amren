<h1>Belize Mob Torches Americans&rsquo; Animal Sanctuary, but Their Will Endures</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Brice, CNN, September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An American couple in Belize struggled Tuesday to figure out their future, their dreams literally up in smoke after a mob of indigenous Mayans burned down their animal sanctuary in the belief the foreigners fed two missing children to crocodiles on their property.</p>
<p>Cherie and Vince Rose moved to the tiny Central American nation in 2004 to form a 36-acre sanctuary for two species of endangered crocodiles found in Belize  &mdash;  the American and Morelet&rsquo;s crocodiles.</p>
<p>Bit by bit, their hope turned into reality. They built a two-story octagonal house that rested on stilts and reached 30 feet into the air. They constructed two smaller cottages to house researchers and students. They dug out two acres of canals for the crocodiles. They acquired two boats.</p>
<p>They called the place the American Crocodile Education Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Most of it vanished Sunday morning, when a throng of angry villagers from a settlement about 10 miles away torched the buildings on their property. A local psychic had told the villagers that the Americans had fed the two missing children to the 17 crocodiles at the sanctuary, police say.</p>
<p>The Roses were rescuing three crocodiles on a distant island at the time, so were not home to ward off the attack  &mdash;  or possibly suffer a gruesome fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like something out of a Frankenstein movie,&#8221; Cherie Rose said Tuesday. &#8220;If we&rsquo;d been home, they would have killed us. They said they were going to chop us up and feed us to the crocodiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We love what we do, and the adventure is just incredible,&#8221; said Cherie Rose, who is 44 and said she has a biology degree from Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania. &#8220;We do more in one day than some people do in a lifetime.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to stay in Belize. We are going to fight this. I&rsquo;m not abandoning those crocodiles down there.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I had a friend some years ago  (1980&rsquo;s) that had a place in Belize - out in the jungle.  It wasn&rsquo;t much.  After about three years he gave up on it.  It seems when he would return to Houston, the locals would go in and strip the place bare.</p>
<p>After a while, you get tired of replacing the stuff.  He never liked Belize City.  Too dangerous.</p>
<p>I found out about six months ago that he died in Hurricane Ike as it went up the Ship Channel.  He was a good guy&hellip;I miss him.</p>

		<p>The best way to save the wildlife if for all whites and non-native peoples to leave all third world countries (and this means withdrawing all funding as well) and allowing the natives to lapse into the nativism and primitivism they obviously gravitate towards.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was like something out of a Frankenstein movie,&rsquo; Cherie Rose said Tuesday. &lsquo;If we&rsquo;d been home, they would have killed us. They said they were going to chop us up and feed us to the crocodiles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, this article does reflect on the laughable concept of multiculturalism. One can &ldquo;only guess&rdquo; at just what Mr. and Mrs. Roses&rsquo; politics are like, but I would hazard a million dollars that they of the rainbow Marxist sort. Most incriminating in this speculation of mine, is the fact that CNN (The Communist News Network) is so energetically mortified by what happened here to this crocodile sanctuary at the hands of Mayans, and what might have happened to the Roses had they been there; that they are directly reporting on the racial/ethnic makeup of the reddish brown &ldquo;Frankenstein&rdquo; mob in question, says a lot.</p>
<p>One wonders, had this been an orphanage full of white children attacked by Mayans, if such candor would be allowed on CNN or anywhere else in the 24/7 cable &ldquo;news&rdquo; abyss? </p>
<p>I sincerely doubt it!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Funny, I used to travel on business to the Third World country that is Belize back in the early Seventies.  I don&rsquo;t remember anyone there at that time who looked remotely Mayan.  The population appeared to be a handful of hapless British ex-pats surrounded by an all black-African indigenous population.  </p>
<p>I suppose there could have been Mayans out in the hinterlands, but the capital city of Belize City was purely salt-pepper.</p>

		<p>Just another sad example of third world mob mentality, fueled by superstition and jealousy. Even though I applaud what the Rose&rsquo;s are doing, I think they would be crazy to rebuild in that same location. Surely there&rsquo;s a safer one? If not, they would be wise to have 24/7 armed guards. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s much safer working with the crocodiles than being around the native people.</p>

<p>Belize is the country where the Mexicans of African descent were sent by the White and Hispanic Mexicans. It is not really a typical Hispanic Latin American or Central American country. It is more like Africa.</p>
<p>And the Roses need to get out.</p>

<p>No&hellip;.I think the Roses need to stay in Belize.  It keeps them from doing their thing in MY neighborhood and causing the good people where I live to suffer the consequences of their sick multiculturalism and extremist environmentalist beliefs.</p>
<p>The consequences of what they are doing gave them a break.  Rather than being home at the time and burned alive, they weren&rsquo;t and just lost some replaceable property.  That was a high cost but not something they won&rsquo;t recover from.  However, rather than learning from this, they INSIST on maintaining their insanity and INSIST on denying the inevitable consequences.  </p>
<p>They might not be so lucky next time.  But at least whatever happens as a result will stay in Belize&hellip;..again, not where I live.</p>

		<p>Multiculturalist fantasy and eco-lunacy led to the opportunity for awakening for these folks.  But as the old adage goes, you can lead a horse to water&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>White people will risk their lives for dinosaurs in the arm pit of the world but won&rsquo;t stand up for the legacy that grants them the means and ability to do so.  It&rsquo;s bittersweet to see that the can-do spirit, ingenuity and charity live on in us at the same time it&rsquo;s so horribly misdirected.  </p>
<p>And, proving Einstein&rsquo;s definition of insanity, they&rsquo;re going to go right back and do it again.</p>
<p>No wonder we&rsquo;re in decline.</p>

		<p>The woman is a fool. She says she isn&rsquo;t going to give up on the crocodiles. What a joke. Obviously, the natives don&rsquo;t care about the crocs being endangered, and these are residents of Belize!! <br>
I applaud their efforts to save the crocs, but at what cost? They need to get out of Belize and save their own lives.</p>
<p>And so much for multi-culti, feel good works. Is there any mention of the residents of Belize doing anything to save the crocs? Why is it Whites always seem to be doing environmental work? We use science and reason. The &#8220;more enlightened&#8221; browns use witch craft and superstition. What a joke. The sad thing is, these are the same sorts of people who will come running to white nations for aid money to do something about saving the environment or endangered species. Or else they will blame us for all of it being destroyed. Sigh. If only we, too, had a resident psychic to tell us of the dangers&hellip;..</p>

		<p>This is a common theme throughout portions of Central America. Americans are throwing children to the wild animals or are even eating the kids themselves. The Guatemalan people are particularly susceptible to this argument. They believe that children adopted by American parents are actually sent to what are called casas gordas [fat houses], fattened up, then slaughtered and eaten by Americans!! This is widely believed. NOT so long ago there was an advisory for Americans to avoid certain areas of Guatemala as the danger from attack by outraged Guatemalans was so great.</p>

		<p>Let me try to get this straight.</p>
<p>An American couple is living in a Third World country doing environmental stuff. Following the advice of a psychic, the locals threaten to destroy the Americans&rsquo; work. The police are notified, but can&rsquo;t respond because  of the vicious guard dogs. The mob attacks and destroys the facility, and somehow these dogs are suddenly not so vicious, and even survive the attack.</p>
<p>The American couple vows to stay on.</p>

		<p>If only people like the Roses could care for the genetics that gives rise to compassion for the crocodiles like they do the crocodiles. If only they cared as much for their own race as they do this other species.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about having the correct priorities and a correct understanding of the fundamentals of life in this world.</p>

		<p>Surely after the white people leave, the gators will find plenty of dark meat, esp when various natives feed more kids to the animals and blame it on the curse of white &#8220;oppression&#8221; even if they can&rsquo;t find a white man in 1000 miles. lol. </p>

		<p>They remind me of Christian missionaries. No matter what the natives do to them, they make excuses and decide to stay &#8220;to save their souls&#8221;. AS long as they stay there and not bring their mentality back to the USA, let them live in their la la land.</p>

		<p>Apparently, the Roses were from Aspen, Colorado and are very interesting, accomplished people. They were friends with the musician, John Denver, who gave Vince Rose one his guitars. Vince Rose was John Denver&rsquo;s general contractor and built him a house. The guitar, among many other things, was destroyed by the indigenous Mayan Indians who stormed their compound. So my original post was incorrect, although the police force appears to be heavily black and did little to nothing to stop this attack on the Roses and their compound, their attackers were Mayan Indians.</p>
<p>The Roses need to come back to Colorado. They seem like good people but they are casting their pearls before swine.</p>

<p>And these are the people who according to the PC wisdom were the ones who can accurately predict the end times but yet haven&rsquo;t improved themselves since the 16th century. OH wait, it was the evil White Spaniards who destroyed their civilization with help  from the indigenous tribes who were continually butchered by the Maya. Apparently the Conquistadores were the lesser of the two evils.</p>

		<p>in fairness..<br>
there was a recent occurance in central america / Panama where a transplanted white american couple were found to have murdered and buried mostly other foreign visitors staying on their property,<br>
who had indicated that no one knew/cared where they were.  I seem to recall they also found some native panamanians buried on the land as well, along with the ill-fated single tourists.</p>
<p>I dont know if this incident led to the extra suspicion of other lone-ouposts on central american beaches run by white american couples, but I do also recall that when a nicaraguan woman was murdered some time ago, her jewish american former boyfriend was ultimately tried and jailed, in spite of the fact he was not in the area at the time of the murder, and only came back to attend her funeral.</p>
<p>The basic deal is, these are racialist populations, that see the outsiders and frankly, WHAT THEY ARE, which is outsiders.</p>
<p>we are discouraged, to put in midly, from doing the same, to our severe future ill-fate.    </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that the two missing children may have fallen prey to the crocs. Alligators and crocodiles are vicious and dangerous creatures that don&rsquo;t make good neighbors for hunans.  The Mayans would doubtless be happy to be without them. Anyone who&rsquo;s feeding the crocs would be seen as a menace to the community.</p>
<p>I have little sympathy for crocodiles, or for people who love them. The Mayans probably regard anybody who devotes their lives to caring for crocodiles as complete raving nuts!  In this case, I have to agree with the Mayans.</p>

		<p>Watch a few shows on PBS, Animal Planet, Discover, Nat Geo etc., regarding saving the animal might they be Crocodiles, Whales, Gorillas, Chimpanzees etc., the one major observation I have noticed is leaders of these organizations, the doers and the donors are overwhelming White.   Personally I&rsquo;m a skeptic of many environmental causes especially the global warming scam which is really a multicultural collectivist scheme.  However I would certainly consider myself a conservationist, I want to enjoy and I hope future generations would enjoy the beauty of nature unmolested.  I believe one of the reasons that whites are so prevalent in this area as we have a greater ability to see a future where many of these animals will only be in zo&rsquo;s, unfortunately it&rsquo;s incompatible with are flawed altruistic streak of continued assistance to the muddy third world peoples which continually subsidizes their population growth. </p>

<p>Alligator attacks are not that uncommon in the US especially in Florida.I remember a case about ten years ago in which a 2 year old was killed by an alligator in Florida, and a few years later a 12 year old boy met a similar fate. </p>
