<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2062144&amp;nid=105">Caribbean Crime Wave Linked to US Deportations</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Melia, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), September 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The crime was horrifying enough  &mdash;  a nightclub owner, hacked to death with a machete, was found buried in pieces. But what really outraged people was that the accused killer had been deported from the U.S. to his native Grenada as a convicted felon.</p>
<p>As a foreign-bred criminal, the suspect never should have returned to the close-knit tropical nation, relatives of the victim and others said. Islanders called for more vigilance over deportees by the government, which says it needs help from Washington to handle the return of hardened convicts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The United States has deported thousands of convicted criminals to the Caribbean annually since 1996, when Congress mandated that every non-citizen sentenced to a year or more in prison be kicked out of the country upon release. In all, the U.S. is responsible for about three-quarters of the region&rsquo;s returning criminal deportees, with the United Kingdom and Canada accounting for most of the other ex-cons arriving in the islands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phenomenon that also afflicts many parts of Central America, where street gangs that grew out of Los Angeles spread to the region through massive deportations. Brutal and powerful, the &#8220;Maras&#8221; are blamed for rampant violent crime, extortion and more recently acting as enforcers for drug cartels.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean, governments say deportees are exacerbating crime in nations with high levels of violence such as Jamaica. On the smaller islands such as Grenada, once considered idyllic havens from gang violence, officials say the returning deportees are partly to blame for increasingly bold and sophisticated crimes and homicide rates soaring to record levels.</p>
<p>The United States is attempting to defuse tensions with island governments by exploring programs to help them reintegrate deportees. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the heart of the problem is the disparity of wealth between the United States, where migrants often learn their criminal ways, and their poor homelands, where jobs are scarce and police resources are limited. Moreover, islanders who often left their native lands as children return to countries they barely recognize, with no remaining family.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The biggest impact has been in heavily populated countries like Jamaica, where deportees are suspected in several violent crimes each week, according to Leslie Green, an assistant police commissioner.</p>
<p>But smaller islands are increasingly leading the calls for help from Washington. A Grenada government spokesman, Richard Simon, said they lack the counseling, monitoring and housing services needed to absorb deportees with serious criminal records.</p>
<p>In Dominica, at least one criminal deportee is suspected in a recent pair of brazen, daylight robberies by masked men, Security Minister Charles Savarin said.</p>
<p>In St. Lucia, an island of 170,000 people that received 18 criminal deportees from the U.S. last year, Security Minister Guy Mayers said some of the convicts were apparently recruited into local drug rings that exploit their contacts from overseas prisons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2007, the U.S. launched a pilot program managed by the United Nations&rsquo; International Organization for Migration to help reintegrate deportees. The $3 million project provided services including career counseling and housing assistance in Haiti, Guyana and the Bahamas.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The U.S. launched a $3 million pilot program to provide career counseling and housing assistance in Haiti, Guyana and the Bahamas.&#8221;</p>
<p>This rivals the million Dollar programs to teach Africans how to wash their wee-wee&rsquo;s and the Pakistanis how to dig latrines. </p>
<p>Do you ever wonder why the USA is bankrupt and why your taxes must increase?  How do Democrats keep from laughing as they push thousands of similar &#8220;essential&#8221; projects? </p>

		<p>THEY send their CRIMINALS here in the first place and now of course they blame us for deporting their OWN criminals!  I knew this was coming. Blame Whitey and America for their own crimes!  Watch Obama and the rest of his cohorts decide NOT to deport any 3rd worlder or their criminals. In fact, they will bring more of them to &#8220;atone&#8221; for &#8220;our&#8221; sins. If Whites do not start marching and making alot of noise about immigration, legal and illegal, then we are doomed and we KNOW it. We have sat for way too long while all this has festered to the point of insanity. Just look at all the MS-13 gangs here that will never be deported! </p>

<p>Right. Those Caribbean islands NEVER had any crime until these hard-core bad guys showed up. Crime was non-existent until recently. </p>
<p>Why, the Caribbean islanders are just such happy people and there is such an atmosphere of sharing that there is no crime to speak of and everyone is just content with their lot.</p>
<p>Crime free islands now made desolate by U.S. educated thugs.</p>
<p>Sure, that is what it is. I should have been able to figure it out for myself.</p>

		<p>I have some sympathy for the caribbean countries. Many carribean islands are relatively pleasant places to live. Many white Americans and Europeans even move to and live in West Indian islands, who would never dream of moving into a predominantly neighbourhood in the USA.<br>
The USA has a culture of criminality that a simpler society like say Grenada could not sustain. The Grenadan police could not deal with American criminal gangs, that even American police have such a hard time dealing with.<br>
While deporting the criminals is a correct policy, other options should also be considered, such as longer periods of incarceration, perhaps with sentences partly lived out in the Carribean country.</p>

		<p>Actually, bribing these countries to keep their criminals sounds like one of the better uses of foreign aid. Per capita, probably cheaper than incarcerating them here.</p>

		<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t even be here in the first place. And if that were so, there would be no issue of there returning.</p>

		<p>Well lets start with the gang structure of Americas black and brown -and youll see that the formation of so called gangs are an American invention-their are no native mexican gangs comparabole to the lifestyle of the cholo-the tattooos-signals-dress and longevity of some hispanic gangs surpass any gangs structure they might have had in their home countries.</p>
