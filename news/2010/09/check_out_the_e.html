<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America is known as the Great Melting Pot.</p>
<p>But a closer look at census data shows we&rsquo;re a lot closer to a dinner plate with the peas here, carrots here, potatoes here, and steak over there. In other words, a very high level of racial segregation.</p>
<p>This cool series of maps was produced by Eric Fischer, based on a map of Chicago from Bill Rankin&rsquo;s Radical Cartography.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<blockquote>

		<p>Asians tend to live geographically between white people and blacks or white people and Latinos but never between Latinos and blacks.  Asians have their businesses in black or Latino neighborhoods but don&rsquo;t want to live in those neighborhoods instead live just outside black or Latino neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Who are those Whites all clustered in that small area surrounded by the blacks?  They must spend a vast portion of their collective White GDP on private security systems and guards. I bet their White children are good little raciss, growing up surrounded by blacks.  </p>
<p>Newsweek should send in a team of crack investigative journalists who can audit the White private schools in there for implicit and explicit raciss biases.  Could lead to much needed ethical reform, such as teaching these obviously raciss Whites (they attend private schools! what could be more raciss than that!) that they must learn to continually search themselves for racism by finding the evil in themselves and the good in &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>
<p>This graph will become the undoing of all Chicago&rsquo;s White Communities.  HUD will use it to target them for more Section 8 public housing, thus importing the ghetto and helping it move in right next door.</p>
<p>During Lincoln&rsquo;s time, Illinois had laws against blacks living within the state.  Don&rsquo;t  you know that each of those red dots represents a concentration latent nostalgia for those good old days when White Humanity was sane enough to take its own side of an argument, particularly the dots on the boundaries  between red and the other colors?<br>

		<p>And so what is wrong with patterns of de facto separation of people?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about living with many of the Whites who&rsquo;ve purchased near me but it comes down to choice.</p>
<p>I can choose to move, choose to stay, or have nothing to do with Whites or any other Third World brown types.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, liberals never learn anything from this kind of thing. Liberals look at maps like this and say &#8220;Oh my, this shows how far we have to go, but we just need a few more government programs&#8221; rather than recognizing that it highlights a fundamental trait of human nature that will never be changed: like seeks out like. Liberalism is a lot like religion in this regard; the second coming never arrives, but they never give up waiting for it.</p>

		<p>After having reviewed all 22 maps, I can say that it looks like there&rsquo;s still a lot of white people in America&rsquo;s cities, and the suburbs look overwhelmingly white. I wonder if things will look much different in 40 years? (When whites are expected to become a plurality, rather than the majority).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  Their answer is always &#8220;get the blacks out of their neighborhoods and move them into white towns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait a minute!  Why don&rsquo;t they diversify the black areas by moving whites IN?  Starting with themselves!</p>

		<p>The melting pot was a term used to describe the mixing of various European ethnic groups not other races.  I&rsquo;m surprised there&rsquo;s so much red in a city that&rsquo;s minority White.  I can tell from the map that the upper part of the blue block with red intermixed is a neighborhood in demographic flux with White flight occurring. If these blacks know what&rsquo;s good for them they&rsquo;ll stay in their own neighborhoods because if Whites abandon Chicago they&rsquo;ll take their tax dollars with them.  I don&rsquo;t think Chicago is a very nice city but it could turn into a mega Detroit under the right circumstances. </p>

		<p>  This is yet more conclusive proof that people want to live with their own kind.  When white folks concentrate, it&rsquo;s de facto proof of racist bigotry, but any evidence of black or hispanic supremacy/separatists is embraced by the media and ignored by government bureaucrats as enriching diversity.  Of course this gives the liberal social engineers apoplexy.  60 years of forced Federal integration have not changed peoples&rsquo; desire to exercise their freedom of association to live amongst their own.  <br>
    Several questions do come to mind.  Why would white folks want to live inside a minority run city with horrible schools, white-hating bureaucrats, and crime which finds more affluent neighborhoods to plunder.  And what happens when the power fails?  The rioting and looting and burning spreads out to all the other areas.  Some access to the white enclaves are through dangerous parts of the city which become impassable in a crisis.  A white cop shoots a minority criminal, and segregated neighborhoods become targets rather than safe havens.  <br>
   The above distribution can&rsquo;t survive long term, as ghettos expand into beter neighborhoods leaving a core wasteland.  I observed this process in Richmond, VA.  The process can be researched for 100 years.  Some neighborhoods deteriorated so badly that dozens of blocks became uninhabitable and were razed to became an empty meadow for years.  I understand this is widespread in Detroit, and no doubt other cities as well.  Most people won&rsquo;t return to these wastelands as the crime from surrounding hellholes makes life untenable.  Seems it would be better to rebuild projects and concentrate minorities in the same area.</p>

		<p>The cities aren&rsquo;t even important. Population sinks in the worst; others, like NYC or Baltimore, are experiencing an uptick in educated whites Asian younger professionals. It&rsquo;s the suburbs and exurbs where blacks, who often work for the federal govt, state govt or govt contractors who yield to affirmative action rules, have moved. But even in the suburbs, some neighborhoods are darker than others. Thus formerly good suburban schools are sinking as braided, apathetic or disruptive middle class imports drag down their own education and that of the declining numbers of white students.</p>

		<p>Poster #5 brings up a critical point that all racially aware Whites should be familiar with. Back, primarily prior to World War 2, the term &#8220;race&#8221; was commonly used to describe what we today would call ethnicity; ie. French, German, Italian, Polish, etc. You see this in all manner of liturature prior to that point in time, though &#8220;race&#8221; is also used in the sense we think of today as well, which obviously lease to confusion among some -some genuine, some maliciously used for political ends.   </p>

		<p>this is actually the main reason that the ideas of American Renaissance have not really caught on:  most white people, if they aren&rsquo;t living in hinterland areas that are 95% white or more, live in overwhelmingly white neighborhoods within racially diverse metro areas.  Either way, they aren&rsquo;t dealing with the downsides of multi-racial living on a daily basis.  aside from having to commute a longer distance to work and having to pay higher taxes than they otherwise would, there lives are not that badly impacted.   </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing, by the way.  </p>

		<p>The great liberals of New York City have segregated Manhattan. It&rsquo;s a sight to behold.There are no more black neighborhoods in Manhattan. Even Harlem is 50/50 white.Playgrounds on the west side that were chock full of black kids 15 years ago are now completely white. The only blacks present are the nannies. It&rsquo;s their little secret While they love to tell us how to live: their daily lives are just like Mississippi in the 1950&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Time In and Terrain Matrix economic values matter more than anything here.</p>
<p>Looked at like a battlefield: How long has it taken for the blue color to infiltrate the red in the upper left?  What is the AA or axis of advance for those bridgehead clumps of blue in the far upper right?  How are they penetrating our lines?</p>
<p>Are there major thoroughfares or other &#8216;zoned for X&rsquo; economic areas (rentals or older neighborhoods next to noisy streets and commercial districts) that provide a means for low income groups to bypass white real estate tax values?  Or are they pulling the Hispanic trick of moving into places 10 at a time?</p>
<p>Usually international lakeside or riverfront property in towns has significant value because it is where you will see the importers and major industrial partnerships as well as some truly upscale housing if the scenery supports it.</p>
<p>Yet as the tree rots from the center, the large dominance of blacks in the downtown and middle lakefront areas, radiating outwards, dictates that these regions are at extreme risk to downtown resident criminals seeking higher value areas to prey upon.  And low incentive for further investment as whites leave in droves.</p>
<p>And of course there are seat of government and infrastructural issues.  Cheap government jobs attract minorities while non-detachable elements of social management that whites cannot simply walk away from keep them anchored to a city center (taxes and all) that they no longer feel community with.</p>
<p>Looked at like a disease: Treating the inevitable expansion of a lethal, terminal, illness; over time and with known vectors of likely metastization, you can both estimate the chances of long term survival &#8216;if treated/stopped now&rsquo; and the point at which economic viability as &#8216;quality of life&rsquo; goes to zero and it&rsquo;s time to stop fighting and simply treat the pain if not pull the plug.</p>
<p>THAT is the map I want to see.</p>
<p>Because as American Whites flee ever further from the centers of power that we (used to) do business in, we will become poorer and less able to fend off the pursuing hordes of &#8216;wait for us!&rsquo; dependents.</p>
<p>America the white decent nation will likely cease to be long before America the mongrel barbarian nation achieves population &#8216;balance&rsquo;; due to the economics of being ousted from our means of supporting ourselves as a separate people.</p>
<p>30-20-15-10-5 years ago expansion increments of this would then tell us whether Chicago has until 2050 like the rest of the country.  Or 2025.  Or 2018.</p>
<p>Which is how long term thinkers plan their lives and their children&rsquo;s lives, around survival.</p>

		<p>My current overpopulated urban area seems to be getting whiter in some areas.  I swear until last year I thought there were no more whites left in much of the city.  For the last 10 months or so, I&rsquo;ve been seeing more and more whites all the time.  It feels uncanny because for most of my existence I am around non-whites.  (Due to work.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel I don&rsquo;t even know how to interact with white people anymore, but when I do, it&rsquo;s so refreshing, so much more civilized.  Most blacks are LOUD.  Latinos run the gamut from loud to mute.  Asians mostly never respond nor acknowledge your presence, though some can be very nice.</p>
<p>I was also wondering about the publication of those maps.  The libs are salivating at all the well identified areas they can &#8216;integrate.&rsquo;  There&rsquo;s a whole white country out there to vanquish!</p>

		<p>I just love how liberals always seem to live in &#8220;whitetopias&rsquo;, but always want to dictate how the rest of us live!  This insanity even exists in my own family, as all of my siblings live in &#8220;whites only&#8221; areas throughout this country, while I live in a mid-size southern city which is 35% black. Plus, as a struggling college student, I live in housing which  has a sizable amount of black people, or should I just call them the noisiest people on this planet.  I can guarantee that ANY of these liberal fools, and yes that includes people in my own family, would change their tune if they really had to live among blacks!</p>

		<p>Peope prefer their own kind. This is simply preference and NOT prejudice, an important distinction that liberals are simply NOT able to compute. By the way, the phrase &#8220;melting pot&#8221; was meant to refer to all the &#8220;races&#8221; (actually ethnicities) of Europe, nothing else. Until 1965 immigrants to America (and Canada and Australia) were almost entirerly of European origin. Since these people were all Caucasians and Christians, the real differences were cultural and linguistic. Once a White, Christian, European learned English and absorbed American cultural views and values he (or his descendents) were essentially Americans, being recognizably as &#8220;ethnic&#8221; perhaps only by the nature of their surname. </p>
