<h1>Adams: &#8220;Throw the Bums Out&#8221; Code for &#8220;Throw the Blacks Out&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Celeste Katz, New York Daily News, September 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The breakfast preceding the West Indian Day Parade, as usual, drew politicians of every stripe {snip}.</p>
<p>There were the usual remarks {snip}.</p>
<p>And then there was Sen. Eric Adams of Brooklyn, who used his speech to give a shout-out to Senate Democratic Conference Leader John Sampson who Adams called &#8220;the highest-ranking elected official descended from the Afro-Caribbean community.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adams continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the press, when you look at The Times and look at The Daily News, they&rsquo;re talking about &#8216;throw the bums out&rsquo; and the dysfunction in Albany because we&rsquo;re not functioning the way they used to do business. This is about removing men of color from power. And that&rsquo;s not going to happen. We&rsquo;re going to retain the Senate and make sure there&rsquo;s checks and balances and complexity at the top ranks of state government. That&rsquo;s why John Sampson will continue to be the leader of the State Senate.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&ldquo;There are too many mental midgets out there. This is an intellectual giant that&rsquo;s leading the Senate.   You gotta recognize that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>A mental midget complaining of having too many of his kind, applauding another mental midget who he delusionally sees as an intellectual giant.</p>
<p>Well, these white Democrats are responsible for for this kind of loud, stupid back alley black to show his black stupidity and natural black arrogance.</p>
<p>It makes the entire party look like a pack of fools.  If there is even one AVERAGE black in that legislature I&rsquo;d be surprised.  Blacks have no business in roles that require at least some intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unavoidable that a few from black districts are in elected positions, but the white pols are fools for not ignoring them entirely.  Blacks cry uncontrollably to get what they can&rsquo;t get on merit, and there are white fools who accommodate them.  In every instance states like this one are having big problems. </p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s laughing when, some time in 2011 or 2012, State Senate leader John Sampson and Governor Andrew Cuomo beg U.S. House Speaker John Boehner for a bailout appropriation to head off the state filing bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I was flipping through the St. Louis radio dial late this afternoon, and landed on a local R&B; station for a few minutes.  They had the Michael Baysden (sp?) show on, and he&rsquo;s a national personality out of New York, whose claim to fame was holding a big rally to defend the Six Thugs Over Jena.  His show had national spots purchased by the DNC, which stated that &#8220;black people ought to get out there and vote Democrat, because Obama&rsquo;s doing such a great job!&#8221;  Baysden and his sidekicks inserted pro-Obama and pro-Democrat commentary in the next few minutes.</p>
<p>Even if that happens, it might not affect the ultimate result.  Problem is, most black voters are clumped up in already blue House districts.  Therefore, a higher black turnout won&rsquo;t mean that any more Democrats win House seats than would otherwise with a lower black turnout.  It MIGHT affect a few Senate races, and preclude the GOP taking back the Senate, but what really matters is the House   &mdash;   the House has appropriations power, and could defund the DOJ&rsquo;s lawsuits against Arizona, defund ObamaCare, and so on.  Meanwhile, many of the Republicans running for Senate seats are moderates, RINOs and check-pants types, so it&rsquo;s no big deal if a high black turnout knocks them out.</p>

		<p>Well, I suppose that given that the clear majority of corrupt  pols in NY are black, their fellow blacks could interpret the calls to &#8220;throw the bums out&#8221; as anti-black.  Of course, the more correct interpretation would be that it&rsquo;s a call to throw out all the corrupt politicians, the great majority of whom are in fact black.</p>

I wasn&rsquo;t aware of a racially motivated &#8216;throw the bums out&rsquo; campaign in the New York senate (though it may be true in the eastern New York area; I&rsquo;m in the west, Buffalo area). </p>
<p>Most of the anger seems to be directed at recalcitrant dinosaur liberals such as Sheldon Silver who is said to have too much power, is impervious to change, and makes &#8216;backroom deal&rsquo; which are secret and undemocratic. He basically sets the rules and agenda everyone is forced to go along with:</p>

		<p>Cop-turned-pol Eric Adams has always been a race-baiting black militant.</p>
<p>I remember him years ago accusing famed NY pol Herman Badillo for selling out by marrying a Jewish woman. Very little outrage resulted from the liberal media.</p>
<p>I searched online to see if anyone else remembered this incident and found that unsurprisingly it was recalled by the invaluable Nicholas Stix.</p>

		<p>sbuffalonative is right. I live in upstate New York, and even the local liberal rag of a daily has gone against Silver, who virtually has been running the state since Spitzer left office.  New York has a fundamentally dysfunctional and profoundly corrupt State legislature. Assemblymen and Senators from both parties participate in doling out unnecessary pork to keep themselves in office.  Then they gerrymander districts every ten years to ensure it. (Sound like any other legislative body we can think of?  Except here, BOTH houses get to set their own districts.)</p>
<p>Maybe  Adams is feeling sensitive to the fact that many of the most egregious elected criminals are &#8220;minorities&#8221; in the legislature who never have to to worry about re-election, never being challenged even within their own parties. (Again, sound familiar?)</p>

		<p>Wonderful! This type of laughable nonsense regarding crypto &#8220;racism&#8221; and the like just makes a complete mockery of the whole discrimination racket! Even the most race-neutered Whites now basically roll their eyes at these incessant, nakedly bogus claims of &#8220;racism&#8221; day after day. This is all good news and I cheer on each and every one of these ridiculous articles! </p>
<p>I know folks who used to work with Adams in the NYPD - as they tell it, he was universally despised and thought to be a complete a-hole from the get-go. The chip on his shoulder was known and obvious from way, way back.  </p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Brooklyn-born Sampson, he said, &ldquo;is one-third of the power in the baddest state in the baddest country on the baddest planet&rdquo; and added: &ldquo;There are too many mental midgets out there. This is an intellectual giant that&rsquo;s leading the Senate. <br>
You gotta recognize that&#8221;</p>

		<p>I moved to NYC a few years back from the whitebread midwest (though it&rsquo;s &#8216;changing&rsquo; too) and I must say that white liberals out here are quite a jumble of contradictions.</p>
<p>They FORECEFULLY defend and promote &#8216;diversity&rsquo; at all levels everywhere, as long as it&rsquo;s working class whites AND NOT THEM who have to experience it.</p>
<p>Whenever &#8216;minorities&rsquo; gain a foothold in their lily-white power structures, then these same liberals become rabid dogs, and they do use coded language to alert their minions about the threat to their own economic and political bases.</p>

<p>Westchester is less than half white and was recently sued by the Department of Justice for not building enough &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo; for minorities and is now atoning for this great sin by building more homes for its diverse citizens.</p>

Well, of course! They want to get YOU integrated.<br>
That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about. That way they can buy off the blacks, spare themselves, and divert black anger towards you instead of them. They can also profit off minority grudges against the majority.</p>
<p>They have nothing but contempt for working class whites. You&rsquo;re not their kind of people. All their compassion is reserved for non-whites&hellip;but not up too close, please.</p>

<p>Sorry, a GOP house might defund Obama care a little, but they love illegal aliens and affirmative action as much as liberals do.  It was Richard Nixon, not Lyndon Johnson who added new provisions to the original civil rights act making it mandatory that Whites be banned from so many jobs.  And of course the GOP is the party of big business, the group that has plotted and schemed to destroy the American working class with cheap immigrant labor since the immigration restrictions of 1924.</p>
<p>GOP contributors don&rsquo;t even advertise jobs in America any more.  They advertise in Mexican papers and provide transportation to the jobs all over the United States.</p>

		<p>A real estate code for ghetto is &#8220;civil servants&#8221; or &#8220;government employees&#8221;</p>
<p>When prospective tenants or homebuyers ask about the schools and neighborhood and the agent replies, &#8220;mostly civil servants&#8221; or even worse the &#8220;children of government employees&#8221; everyone knows it is a code for black and hispanic ghetto thugs with their affirmative action jobs and affirmative action mortgages and their thuggish children who have already destroyed the school system.</p>
