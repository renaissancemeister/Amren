<h1>&#8216;Machete&rsquo; Producers Lied About Racist Bloodbath</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Dykes &amp; Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, Sept. 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8216;Machete&rsquo; reached the #3 spot at the box office opening weekend. But after viewing the film, it is clear that its producers lied about the extent of the film&rsquo;s racial message, which includes vulgar atrocities, including the killing of a pregnant woman attempting to cross the border during one of the opening scenes. This deception about the film&rsquo;s message could bring its tax incentives, worth millions in production costs, into question.</p>
<p>When Alex Jones expressed concern in May that a leaked script portrayed white characters as vehemently racist and wantonly murderous, or that a Latino mob is roused to take on border vigilantes in racial conflict, director Rodriguez assured Ain&rsquo;t It Cool News, that he&rsquo;d &#8216;had too much tequila,&rsquo; and that those types of scenes wouldn&rsquo;t make it to the final edited version. Producer Elizabeth Avellan went on the attack just before the release, defending the tax incentives &#8216;Machete&rsquo; had practically already been assured. Avellan denounced the &#8216;uproar over the film&rsquo; as &#8220;unfounded and unnecessary,&#8221; stating there was &#8216;no reason for a denial of incentives&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people made up a lot of stuff in terms of what the movie is about and who the bad guy is,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There were a lot of things that people misconstrued &hellip; without even knowing the script and pretending they have a script.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there is no doubt. Everything Jones quoted from the script was on screen in one form or another  &mdash;  and its tone was clear: opposition to illegal immigration is tantamount to murder, white racism and vile Machiavellian scheming. One scene that was excised from the script repeated the one-sided demonization of the Freedom Force vigilantes, who were to murder a young child on the border at the end. However, that ending was left behind for a different sequence altogether.</p>
<p>Reviewers like &#8216;Big Hollywood&rsquo; panned the film as &#8216;Dull, Convoluted, Racist and Anti-American,&rsquo; criticizing that: &#8220;&#8216;Machete&rsquo; offers no middle ground, no reasonable, non-racist position against wide open borders for those fleeing from what one character describes as the &#8220;personal hell&#8221; that is Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who the illegals fight against on screen is one thing. What their words mean is altogether something else. That&rsquo;s the shell game Rodriguez plays and his racially divisive messaging goes way beyond the normal cinematic political posturing and button-pushing. And you will never see a more stereotypically racist portrayal of Southerners, who, in an obvious reference to the border Minute Men, are not only played for cheap laughs but portrayed as sub-human animals who hunt and murder illegals  &mdash;  kill a helpless pregnant woman and say &#8220;Welcome to America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Blood-soaked and dripping with hate<br>
</strong><br>
It wasn&rsquo;t the extreme levels of violence or its nudity that made this film so offensive; it was the one-sided approval of Hispanic revenge killings while uniformly demonizing the actions of the white groups involved. Though the head Mexican drug lord was the ultimate enemy, he was served exclusively by white politicians and radical groups; everyone in &#8216;The Network&rsquo; worked against him.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the film was marketed towards Hispanic groups, including widespread promotion throughout Latin America, featuring a poster with an image of a blood-dripping machete (the symbol of peasant uprising). Now Hollywood&rsquo;s exports aren&rsquo;t just American cultural hegemony, but a weaponized-subsection of radicalized Latino culture that draws in crowds by playing to Hispanic supremacy.<br>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not been such an openly racist film in America since the early days of cinema where the pro-KKK &#8216;Birth of a Nation,&rsquo; and films featuring Charlie Chan and other &#8220;coolies&#8221; epitomized a cruder era of filmmaking full of offensive stereotypes. 70s exploitation films don&rsquo;t come close to &#8216;Machete,&rsquo; despite inspiring much of its style. Today, such depictions from early cinema have been denounced. Why then would today&rsquo;s politically-correct culture who denounce these stereotypes accept and praise a racist filmmaker who pans to the Hispanic market?</p>

<p>Bienvenidos Estados Unidos! Sure. That is what the killers of the illegals down in Mexico recently must have been saying. What was it, 72 or folks from all over Latin American gunned down all at once.</p>
<p>And if anyone should be mad, it should be the gringo whitey. A half dozen to a dozen Americano are killed EVERDAY in this country by illegal aliens in one form or another. And that does NOT include the killings of illegals by other illegals, mostly drug dealers conducting a drug deal &#8220;gone sour&#8221;, as they call it.</p>
<p>And I am afraid too this movie will be taken seriously by impressionable illiterate meztiso Latins who really do think the gringo is an evil monster. This will make a bad impression with them.</p>

		<p>People who put an anti-white, racist bloodbath on screen also lied to us about doing so.<br>
I guess it goes to show that you just can&rsquo;t trust people who want to promote the wholesale slaughter of your race to tell you the truth.  Of course, lying is rather small potatoes compared to genocide, so I guess we shouldn&rsquo;t be too upset about the lying part.</p>

		<p>I watched &#8220;Machete&#8221; today; it is an overtly racist bit of anti-Caucasian, pro-illegal immigrant propaganda; negative stereotypes as far as the eye could see. To avoid spoiling the film for anyone who decides to see it I&rsquo;ll not comment further, except to say that the sociopolitical effect of the film will likely be the opposite of the effect intended.</p>

<p>Well, I normally hesitate to condemn a film without seeing it, but this certainly does not sound good.  I&rsquo;ve always been against censorship, but with bloody propaganda like this, I have to stop and reconsider my views. Trash like this truly incites people to violence. A lot of viewers - especially in the audience to which it&rsquo;s targeted - are very impressionable and will believe just about anything they see on screen. Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid some things need to be controlled. </p>
<p>Can we expect to see real incidents of violence stemming from this?  Could the film&rsquo;s producers be held legally culpable for incitement?  I hope so.</p>
<p>How much mischief and misery is this &#8220;work of art&#8221; going to stir up?  It this going to be the 21st century equivalent of &#8220;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&#8221;?</p>
<p>And, oh, I&rsquo;d love to know more about those, um, &hellip;&#8221;tax incentives.&#8221;   Please tell!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to know the racial makeup of the folks who went to see Machete. It&rsquo;s gotten a lot of praise from self-hating Whites so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Hispanics were actually a minority of viewers.</p>

		<p>Why, you ask?  Well, because the PC crowd is more than willing to play up stereotypes, incite violence against any who disagree with them or have a different answer, pander to the criminal and violent elements of other than whites, and demonize white American and especially southern culture, mores, and ideals.  That&rsquo;s why.  Because they get away with it.  We let them.  </p>

<p>All of us should applaud movies like this one and hope more will be made, right along with more anti-white hatred from the community organizer and his minions, because these types of things bring more support to our side than any amount of truthful words we could write in ten years.</p>
<p>This mestizo moron made this movie, because he actually thought he would scare whites into giving his tribesmen amnesty, which would help his dream come true of a mestizo controlled America, just as the community organizer and most ALL blacks want a black controlled USA.</p>
<p>It helps get whitey off the couch, and it encourages non-whites to violence.</p>
<p>If we had a contingent of mestizos periodically attacking and killing whites, as this racist movie is about, this feeble 2 million government force of police and military couldn&rsquo;t begin to control the millions of armed whites that would form militias consisting of millions, to say nothing of the military and police groups who would shift to white defense.</p>
<p>This empire is in serious decline, so whether the mestizos and blacks start killing whites doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway, because this multicultural mess is on the way out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.  All we have to do is watch and wait.  They&rsquo;re causing the wrath of destruction to come down on their own heads faster than anything we could ever do.</p>

		<p>Do not underestimate the power of the mass media.  This film will galvanize opinion in the Hispanic community.  The majority of humans (particularly those who are not too bright) are monkey-see/monkey-do creatures.  This is what Nietzsche termed the goat herd.</p>
<p>While the train is racing toward the cliff regardless, &#8220;Machete&#8221; will have the effect of shoveling a few more loads of coal in the furnace to ensure we get there more quickly.<br>

		<p>Such a movie simply provides another reason for Anglos to maintain hard feelings against Mexican illegals.  The U.S. presently has a Prez who bends over backwards trying to please Hispanics  &mdash;  either to desperately try to win back their dwindling support or to just poke whitey in the eye  &mdash;  but the nation will one day have a leader elected (probably in two years) by uprising conservatives.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve never been more outraged than I was by Obama&rsquo;s craven agreement with Calderone&rsquo;s condemnation of AZ and Congress&rsquo;s standing ovation to him.  To me, such actions smack of outright treason!<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s time Americans make a movie called &#8220;Pitchfork&#8221;.</p>

<p>Political Correctness, i.e., cultural Marxism, is not and never was about doing away with stereotypes; it&rsquo;s about breaking down white racial consciousness, instilling incurable feelings of guilt among white people, and manipulating whites to act against their own racial interests.  That&rsquo;s why obvious anti-white hate propaganda is either ignored, downplayed, or somehow justified whereas even the slightest suggestion of implicit whiteness - such as a Tea Party protest - is roundly condemned by the high priests of politically-correct culture.  </p>

		<p>Every review Ive seen of the film doesnt mention or plays down the race angle, not a big surprise. Its been getting thumbs up from several reviewers,and obviously large numbers of young whites are going if its at #3.

<p>Because turnabout is fair play, as far as the lefties are concerned, and two wrongs do indeed make a right. That&rsquo;s the way the left has been playing it for the last half century and it&rsquo;s going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p>Karl Ketzer, please stand up to accept your well-deserved award for having laser-beam-accurate insight and for being able to see into the diabolically evil minds of the Cultural Marxist enemy within.  </p>
<p>Also, if one studies the history of Communism - and how these radical, hard-core, anti-White, anti-Western, nation wrecking subversives have historically operated whenever they are in the process of agitating for a revolution against the majority population and their cultural dominance, these kinds of techniques are easily recognizable.  Many have written on the topic of Cultural Marxism - and noted that it, unlike the Bolshevik&rsquo;s in 1917 in Russia, have yet to resort to open violence - and it has been a much softer, more subtle, more devious method of overturning the dominant White Western culture in America.    At any rate, this sickness of Cultural Marxism is now being identified and exposed by more and more people in the pro-white nationalist community, and it&rsquo;s my sense that this exposure is causing considerable angst in the Cultural Marxism camp.    </p>
<p>Therefore, as these subversives see millions of whites around the world beginning to wake up and to begin to organize themselves - even if its only implicitly - to defend their legitimate ethnic interests,  it may be that they are now deciding to switch their tactics, and begin to openly foment for violence against whites.  This anti-white demonization and endless defamation of Whites, and White Southerners in particular - by our media -  has been going on for well over 50<br>
years - but I now detect a very pronounced effort by the Hollywood Cultural Marxists to ratchet it up and openly and brazenly incite non-whites to attack whites.  After all, the ultimate objective of the Cultural Marxist ideology is the genocide of White Europeans and the total destruction of White Western Civilization - and eventually, violence must occur for this objective to be reached.</p>
<p>Oh, and here is a News Flash to you white race chickens in the Tea Party:  Stop apologizing for being white. Absolve yourself of your media induced white guilt.   Stop pandering to minorities who by overwhelming and rock-solid majorities will never support 99% of the issues that the Tea Party claims to support.   Why?   Simple - those issues are primarily things that appeal to the white majority, and smaller government and lower taxes and sealing our borders are all things that send a very clear message to minorities.  What is that message?   Less welfare, less social entitlement programs, less redistribution of the income of white middle class taxpayers to pay for a whole host of goodies that minorities desire, but which they think someone else (whitey) should pay for.     </p>
<p>Oh, and here is another news flash to the white race chickens in the Tea Party:   Your movement is being coopted by the very same establishment &#8216;neo-cons&rsquo; who lied us into multiple wars and they are using you to get back into power in order to kick off even more wars.    Not only that, but when Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck appear at a rally for white people - and shower praise on a known Communist named Martin Luther King Jr., and fall over backwards with their digusting pandering to every non-white ethnic group in the nation - they are sending you a clear message, and that message is:  Whites do not matter to them. You are seen as useful idiots, nothing more.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin, Glenn  Beck, and every one of their globalist-internationalist ilk in the GOP equates to a return to business as usual.  Anti-White politics as usual, to be more accurate.</p>
<p>So, just how much longer are whites going to put up with being used and then betrayed by the lying, war mongering, crooked politicians who cleverly con us out of our votes and support?  Do whites secretly ENJOY being made fools out of, or what?</p>
<p>White Nationalists must have a European Nationalist political party that will unabashedly, and without apology, advocate for the legitimate ethnic interests of White European people.   Nothing else is going to be acceptable.  Stop letting our enemies set the terms and boundaries for the debate that involves the survival of White Western people!</p>

<p>Read the books if you can&rsquo;t see the movie.</p>

		<p>I too am one who would like to know what is meant by those &#8220;tax incentives&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
  <i>&#8220;If one studies the history of Communism - and how these radical, hard-core, anti-White, anti-Western, nation-wrecking subversives have historically operated whenever they are in the process of agitating for a revolution against the majority population and its cultural dominance &hellip;  it may be that they are now switching their tactics and begining, openly, to foment violence against whites. This anti-white demonization and endless defamation  of Whites by the media  &mdash;   of White Southerners in particular   &mdash;    has been going on for well over 50 years.  But I now detect a pronounced effort by the Cultural Marxists of Hollywood to ratchet it up, and openly and brazenly incite non-whites to attack whites. After all, the ultimate objective of the Cultural Marxist ideology is white genocide  &hellip;&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;  Luke</i></p>
<p><br>
And kudos to Luke for an excellent analysis of what&rsquo;s really going on, the maneuvering beneath the surface.  It&rsquo;s good to see that some people really &#8220;get&#8221; it.  Yes, unlike Bolshevik Russia, America has yet to see organized, open violence against whites. But that could be coming, as Hollywood &#8220;rachets it up&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Right now, with the fuss about immigration, border control, etc. this could seem the perfect time for Hollywood&rsquo;s Bolsheviks to start their pogrom against us. We will be the new Kulaks.  We already see them dreaming of this on the screen and peddling their dream to the masses.</p>

		<p>This is somewhat reminiscent of D.W. Griffith&rsquo;s &#8220;Birth of a Nation,&#8221; where images of of the Reconstructionist era caused a few deaths and real life lynchings to take place in the streets, after the movie had been shown in the theater.</p>
<p>As to how taxes relate to financing movies, it&rsquo;s more common in smaller countries with lesser film colonies, but a lot of times movies will be made with tax shelter money. Instead of donating to a charity or making a standard deferal, you can pay into a movie and even bring your family down to the set sometimes for a day, to witness a shoot.</p>

		<p><i>But if you&rsquo;re really afraid, go get a CCW permit. A gun beats a machete anyday.</i></p>
<p>Here in Arizona, we are no longer even required to have permits to carry concealed, and we&rsquo;ve never been required to have them to carry openly. Unlike in California, we were never stupid enough to relinquish our Second Amendment rights in exchange for false promises of safety from a bunch of political prostitutes. As a result, the types of histrionics displayed in <i>Machete</i> do not intimidate us, they anger us. Evidently, this has escaped the notice of the La Raza types. </p>
<p>I will definitely be packing at all times for the foreseeable future. </p>

		<p>So typical of blacks and hispanics.  They hate whites, but want our money and to be in our countries to further their agendas.  Must be something in darker-colored skin that makes them complete hypocrites when it comes to racial issues.  (Or maybe it&rsquo;s their collective single-digit IQs.)</p>

		<p>Machete is a spin off from the Grindhouse/Deathproof films. They are over the top, violent films filled with dark humor.</p>
<p>All the characters in Machete appear to be extremely whacked and no one (not even Hispanics) could take them seriously. These films (Machete, Deathproof, Grindhouse) appeal to an audience that really loves over the top satirical portrayals of violence. I am a fan of these films. This media hype and the mention of Arizona in the final trailers is 100% pure hype (as is the fact two Hispanics that worked on the film called Alex Jones to report the fact it had a violent script based on a race war).</p>
<p>Seriously people watch the trailer and see what I mean, you CANNOT take this stuff literally! This is a fun trashy movie made to appeal to a specific audience and you can be sure the rumors of &#8220;censored scenes&#8221; will make for great DVD rentals as this audience MUST SEE those censored scenes. All the hype on Alex Jones and the WN sites is great marketing.</p>
<p>Watch the trailer here and see what I mean:</p>

		<p>Also for those not familiar with the others in the series, Grindhouse came out in 2007 which means the script and filming had to likely predate it by at least a year (2006).</p>
<p>Grindhouse actually included a made-up &#8220;trailer&#8221; for Machete as all the films are linked. This film was conceived of at least 4-5 years ago, they are taking advantage of the recent illegal immigration debate because it just happens to be timely upon the release. </p>

		<p>If someone else hasn&rsquo;t noted this already:</p>
<p>Charlie Chan was NOT portrayed as a &#8220;coolie.&#8221;  He was a master detective and the hero of every plot.  His aid or son, I forget which, was a young Chinese man who was portrayed as a modern young American, virtuus and loyal to &#8220;Pop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Life with Luigi, Amos and Andy, Lum and Abner, Duffy&rsquo;s Tavern, Senator Claghorn on the Fred Allen show, Mister Kitzel on Jack Benny, the Goldbergs, the Life of Riley were all portrayed with affection and good humor.  Ethnic dfferences then were recognized, enjoyed, and celebrated.</p>
<p>They were definitely not the bad old days.</p>
