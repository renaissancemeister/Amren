			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ashley Powers, Los Angeles Times, September 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In recent months, Sheriff Joe Arpaio has tried to extend his political reach outside his home state of Arizona, where he has gained national notoriety for lightning-rod tactics to root out illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>With Arizona&rsquo;s controversial new immigration law, SB 1070, rekindling national interest in border security, Arpaio has appeared in Kentucky and Kansas and elsewhere as an emblem of a stern law-and-order approach. On Sunday, he is scheduled to speak at a Republican lunch in the key primary state of New Hampshire, which has led some observers to wonder if he&rsquo;s considering a presidential bid.</p>
<p>Last week Arpaio waded into the high-profile Nevada Senate race, cheering on Republican Sharron Angle, a &#8220;tea party&#8221; favorite locked in a tight contest with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio has recently been touting the power of his support, saying it carried more weight than that of Republican Sen. John McCain, at least in Arizona. Arpaio, sheriff of Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, won reelection in 2008 with 55% of the vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has been testing his political strength outside the Grand Canyon State by supporting candidates for Michigan governor, California Assembly and congressional seats in Florida and Missouri, among others. His political advisor, Chad Willems, said a number of GOP candidates have sought the sheriff&rsquo;s backing, though his track record out of state has been less successful than in Arizona.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though his endorsement of California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner made little difference in the state&rsquo;s GOP gubernatorial primary  &mdash;  Meg Whitman won  &mdash;  his backing has been highly coveted in strongly Republican legislative districts, said Allan Hoffenblum, publisher of the nonpartisan California Target Book.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reid and Angle hold polar-opposite views on immigration, as they do on many issues. Though in 1993 Reid supported a bill that would have denied citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants, he later called it the &#8220;biggest mistake I ever made.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I glad Joe Arpaio is not only fighting back but is taking the fight regarding immigration to his foes.  Joe may strike gold in Nevada which has been overrun with illegals, mostly in Las Vegas.<br>
The casinos attracted huge numbers of illegals to do the many low income jobs and the result is that Mexican children and social benefits have overwhelmled the system.  Hopefully Joe can help Sharon Angle retire Harry Reid. Reid has played a major role in assisting Obama pass Obamacare and other outrages.<br>

		<p>I WISH Arpaio would run for president. You can bet your life he&rsquo;d have MY vote! He is about the only person I know of who has stuck to his guns, and not given in to political pressure or out right intimidation. It&rsquo;s not surprising he has more clout than that two faced liar McAmnesty, who hasn&rsquo;t a clue of the meaning  of loyalalty to this Country. Lucky he had all that money to buy his primary win.</p>
<p>If there were more politicians who would stick to their guns and not grovel and apologize at the first hint of &#8220;scandal&#8221;, they might just be surprised at how much support they would get AND keep!</p>

		<p>An Arpaio endorsement could definitely persuade me to give a candidate another look.</p>

<p>I say why not?</p>
<p>When one considers the inexperienced and ideologically driven mulatto buffoon we have in the White House now, a well trained seal would be preferable. Sheriff Arpaio has been in office since 1992, through most of this he has been relentlessly hounded by the feds with nothing sticking. Sounds like a pretty good resume to me, and of course his tough stance on the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; issue doesn&rsquo;t hurt at all!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got mixed feelings about Arpaio. On the one hand, I like the way he stands up to the feds and I support his stand on immigration. On the other hand, I think he&rsquo;s a self-serving publicity hound with political ambitions who could easily turn into another Nifong. If I had any say in the matter, I&rsquo;d give him a strictly border-control and interdiction role and make sure he didn&rsquo;t have any responsibilities for jail administration. And I&rsquo;d make sure he didn&rsquo;t run for higher office. Sheriff Joe&rsquo;s perfect for chasing down illegals, but he&rsquo;d make a terrible DA or governor, let alone President. I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;d be worse than the Clinton-Bush-Obama crowd. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s possible.  </p>

<p>This was of course the only correct political position that Harry Reid ever took.  Does Mexico grant automatic citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants in Mexico?  Of course not.</p>
