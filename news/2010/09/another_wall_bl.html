<h1><a href="https://www.banderasnews.com/1009/edat-anotherwall.htm">Another Wall Blocks Route to U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Danilo Valladares, Inter Press Service (Rome), September 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Travelling without documents to the United States from Latin America can turn into an odyssey, in which migrants have to elude common criminals and drug traffickers along the way, not to mention the laws on migration. But now another obstacle is emerging: a wall between Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
<p>According to the head of customs for Mexico&rsquo;s tax administration, Raúl Díaz, in order to stop boats carrying contraband, the southern Mexican state of Chiapas is building a wall along the border river Suchiate, similar to the one the United States is building along its southern border with Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could also prevent the free passage of illegal immigrants,&#8221; admitted the Mexican official.</p>
<p>Smugglers use the Suchiate River to move products across an international border without paying duty taxes, but at the same time, thousands of Central and South Americans cross the river in their attempts to reach the United States in search of opportunity  &mdash;  and without the required documents.</p>
<p>Some 500,000 migrants cross Mexican territory without permission each year, according to Mexico&rsquo;s National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH).</p>
<p>The intention to build a border wall has triggered a wave of opposition from civil society and government organisations, with charges that it is a &#8220;senseless&#8221; measure that will not succeed in preventing undocumented migrants from crossing the border on their way north.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are watching the Mexican government&rsquo;s initiative with concern because the migrants are in a situation of highest vulnerability, as demonstrated by the massacre in Tamaulipas, where five Guatemalans died,&#8221; Erick Maldonado, executive secretary of Guatemala&rsquo;s National Council on Migrants, told IPS.</p>
<p>The cruelty to which undocumented migrants are often subjected was laid bare Aug. 23, when 72 people coming from Guatemala, as well as El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and Brazil, were brutally murdered in San Fernando, a town in the eastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. They were presumably killed by the Los Zetas drug cartel, which is also involved in kidnapping and exploiting migrants.</p>
<p>In addition, a total of 9,758 kidnappings of migrants were reported in Mexico from September 2008 to February 2009, according to the CNDH.</p>
<p>Putting up a wall on the Guatemala-Mexico border &#8220;is going to make the migrants&rsquo; situation worse, because to meet their needs they are always going to find blind points where there are no migration or security controls, which implies greater risks,&#8221; said Maldonado.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of the Latin Americans, and especially Central Americans, who emigrate &#8220;without papers&#8221; to the United States has remained at the forefront in recent months, not only because of intense violence like the Tamaulipas massacre, but also because of government measures taken to fight illegal migration.</p>
<p>Law SB1070, enacted Apr. 23 by the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona, authorises police to inquire into the immigration status of any person based on &#8220;reasonable suspicion.&#8221; Critics say the legislation leads to racial profiling and violations of civil liberties.</p>
<p>The long line of obstacles that migrants face on their way to the United States gets longer with the construction of the wall on the Mexico-Guatemala border.</p>
<p>However, the authorities in Guatemala have yet to receive any information from the Mexican government about the wall.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Maldonado expressed his concern this week to Mexico&rsquo;s migration representative in Guatemala, Alejandro Martínez.</p>
<p>Opposition to the project has even reached the highest circles: &#8220;Walls we can jump over; they are not a solution to the problem,&#8221; was the terse comment from the vice-president of Guatemala, Rafael Espada.</p>
<p>The Chiapas state&rsquo;s intention to build a wall in some ways echoes the United States&rsquo; controversial construction of the 1,126-kilometre wall along its southern border river  &mdash;  known as Río Grande in the U.S.; Río Bravo in Mexico  &mdash;  to prevent entry of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dramatic increase in the cost of &#8216;polleros&rsquo; (human traffickers) and the corruption of the authorities is the result of the walls the United States plans to build and has built along the border. We can transpose the Guatemala case to this situation and the results will be the same,&#8221; Catholic priest Francisco Pellizari, of the Casa del Migrante (Migrant House), told IPS.</p>
<p>According to the priest, walls are a &#8220;historic error&#8221; in many countries around the world, and have failed to resolve the problems associated with migration.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are supposedly intended to halt migration, but that hasn&rsquo;t happened. Instead they have triggered an economic haemorrhage and a shift in the migratory flow to inhospitable routes that lead to thousands of deaths,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Erick Zúñiga, mayor of the western Guatemalan municipality of Ayutla, better known as Tecún Umán, bordering Mexico, said the state of Chiapas has already begun construction of the barrier, which he said &#8220;looks like a wall to prevent the Suchiate River from flooding.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any case, said the mayor, &#8220;no wall will prevent migration. It won&rsquo;t stop people from crossing because they are going in search of job opportunities and a future for their families.&#8221;<br>

<p>NOT &#8220;have to&#8221;! The drug traffickers, the common criminals, the coyotes, the &#8220;mules&#8221; are all hand in glove and part of the total package!</p>
<p>I recall some years ago seeing in a National Geographic edition about the border between Mex and Guat. On the Mex side was bare land, barely suitable for grazing. On the Guat side was rain forest, the two areas separated by a small wire fence. I bet on both sides is all desolation now.</p>

		<p>What!? You mean to tell me those hypocrites in Mexico are not happy with folk from Guatemala entering their country illegally??? Why, how racist of them! Don&rsquo;t they know those people are just looking for a better life?</p>
<p><br>
How DARE any Mexican &#8220;offical&#8221; preach to us ever again about human rights and racial profiling, or question our immigration laws!</p>

<p>Lol&hellip;.so does the common practice of mexicans shooting them on sight.</p>
<p>Mexico is very different (and highly hypocritical) in how it deals with illegal immigration.  And illegal immigrant coming into mexico can expect to be beaten, have all their possessions taken, raped, and dumped back over the border, if they are simply executed extra-judicially.</p>
<p>Oh&hellip;.and then there are the ones who make it.  Usually, those people are tied up, shoved in the back of a tractor trailer and then put to work as slaves, minding drug crops in our national parks.  They don&rsquo;t live long.</p>
<p>Never forget the leftists who support &#8220;migrant rights&#8221; forget what they are actually allowing to happen.</p>

		<p>This is funny.  The wall is being built by the same government that says that any attempt on our part to enforce our immigration laws is a violation of human rights.</p>

<p>&hellip;And so the solution is to make the route to the US as hospitable as possible, isn&rsquo;t it then? It certainly isn&rsquo;t examining the mismanagement and corruption that has made the attempt to break another nation&rsquo;s laws so appealing in the first place.</p>
<p>As a typical MSM piece, I also notice all of the quotes were from those who thought the wall is simply terrible, but none that pointed out the gross hypocrisy of Mexico&rsquo;s lecturing of the US for its own border control while enforcing its own far more ruthless version.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;ve got an idea! Let&rsquo;s end birthright citizenship and make getting a job as an illegal in the US so difficult that there is no longer an economic incentive for immigrants to illegally come here. Would that satisfy the &#8220;experts&#8221; quoted in this article who are so concerned about the safety of these border crossers? Of course not, because they really consider it to be the job of the US to be the nanny state for the entire world.</p>

		<p>And if the Wall doesn&rsquo;t work, the Mexican military will drop napalm or worse on the rabble from Central America. The Mexicans are arch-hypocrites. But I  like their style in dealing with their  immigration problem.</p>
<p> I doubt there is much legal immigration in Mexico either unless you&rsquo;re a foreign businessman with mucho dineros to bribe govt officials.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mexico to build wall to keep out illegal immigrants and drug dealers from Guatemala.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess they figured it would draw less attention to their hypocritical bias of US insistence on legal immigration, after 72 Guatemalan immigrants were found murdered in a mass grave in the Mexican interior.</p>
<p>Luckily, they had the drug gangs to blame it on.</p>
<p>Have you heard of a drug gang wanting to kill penniless immigrants for some kind of gain?</p>
<p>Me neither.  </p>

<p>Read that book.  If you do, you will understand how the drug cartels became so powerful and why our government allows the lions share of welfare money to be funneled into the drug trade.</p>
<p>The cliff notes version is this.  Communism was starting to push up into mexico via immigration.  The US made a deal with the drug cartels to allow them to vastly expand if they would exterminate the communists and make them too terrified to move into mexico.  Now, the US is experiencing a huge cost in terms of &#8220;blowback&#8221; from this.<br>
