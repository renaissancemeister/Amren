			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>J. Christian Adams, Pajamas Media, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Today might have been the worst day of all. Former Voting Section Chief Christopher Coates testified to the United States Civil Rights Commission that Obama political appointees dismissed the case because they are opposed to enforcing civil rights laws in a racially neutral fashion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a dramatic hearing in Washington, D.C., Coates simply destroyed the year-long spin from the Justice Department regarding the dismissal. Coates is the former Voting Section chief, and served as lead attorney on the Black Panther case. He has practiced voting rights law longer than any other lawyer at the Justice Department. His testimony today was the worst possible nightmare for the Obama political officials responsible for the dismissal.</p>
<p>I testified before the Commission in July that Obama political appointee Julie Fernandes made it clear that the Voting Section at the Justice Department would not be bringing any more cases against traditional national racial minorities, like the members of the New Black Panthers. Under oath, Coates corroborated my testimony.</p>
<p>The public has been wondering for over a year why the case was dismissed. Coates testified why today: &#8220;[There is a] deep-seated opposition to the race-neutral enforcement of the Voting Rights Act against racial minorities and for the protection of whites who have been discriminated against.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coates verified that the DOJ is infested with racially motivated hostility towards equal enforcement of the law. Like me, Coates testified about the history of open and pervasive hostility inside the Voting Section to protecting the rights of white voters. This hostility first emerged in the case against Ike Brown in Noxubee County, Mississippi, going back as far as 2004:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coates confirmed that senior managers didn&rsquo;t even want to open the investigation into discrimination against white voters in Noxubee County: &#8220;The Deputy Chief who was leading that election coverage asked me: &#8216;can you believe that we are going to Mississippi to protect white voters?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Coates described how his memoranda were doctored by former Voting Section Chief Joe Rich, {snip}</p>
<p>Coates also testified that he was reprimanded by Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King when he asked attorneys in job interviews {snip} if they were willing to enforce the law in a racially neutral fashion, regardless of the race of the wrongdoer, even if the wrongdoer was black. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King wanted like-minded attorneys who were corruptly willing to turn a blind eye toward racial discrimination committed by national racial minorities. Soon thereafter, Coates was stripped of his power even to interview applicants. {snip}</p>
<p>He testified, as I did, that Justice Department attorneys and staff flatly refused to work on cases where the wrongdoer was black: &#8220;[An attorney told Coates in] no uncertain terms that he had not come to the Voting Section to sue African American defendants. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coates also said that he was testifying because the Department has made misrepresentations to Congress, to the Civil Rights Commission, and to the public, sometimes under oath.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coates provided even more detail about a disgusting case of racially motivated harassment that occurred in the Voting Section: &#8220;A young African American who worked in the Voting Section as a paralegal volunteered to work on the Ike Brown case, and he later volunteered to work on the NBPP case. Because of his participation in the Ike Brown case, he and his mother, who was an employee in another Section of the Civil Rights Division, were harassed by an attorney in that other Section and by an administrative employee and a paralegal in the Voting Section.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was much howling and complaining about the Bush administration hiring attorneys without experience working for left-wing civil rights groups. But now the public learns the truth: perpetrators of genuine racial harassment and gangster intimidation infest the Civil Rights Division, worked for civil rights groups, and were not hired by the Bush administration. {snip}</p>
<p>Coates also corroborated my testimony that Kristen Clarke of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund lobbied to have the lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party dismissed. {snip}</p>
<p>Finally, Coates testified as I did that the Department is unwilling to use Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to protect a white minority. Indeed, he confirmed, the Department refuses to even conduct an analysis whether a voting change will harm a white minority in places like Noxubee County, Mississippi.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, Coates painted a picture of racially motivated lawlessness inside the Department of Justice. I testified about the same circumstances, and there are many others who could provide sworn accounts of the same racially corrupt state of affairs.</p>
<p>America has only heard from two of us, but there are many more who know the truth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, Mike Roman had a blockbuster piece that reveals Philadelphia New Black Panther Jerry Jackson, one of the polling place stormtroopers, is a felon in possession of a firearm. The Holder Justice Department is failing to enforce federal felon in possession statutes against Jackson, which make it a crime for him to possess a firearm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finally, the DOJ inspector general assured Republican Congressmen Frank Wolf and Lamar Smith that he was opening an investigation into whether the Voting Section enforces civil rights laws in a racially discriminatory fashion and harasses employees who bring cases like the New Black Panther lawsuit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Breaking News- Political Alert</p>
<p>Watch for the White Tea Party to keep clear of this story and come out with a stunt showing how much they Embrace Diversity, Expand Tolerance, and Encourage Inclusion.</p>
<p>Instead of exploiting the exposure of pure anti-White hatred in our Federal government, the Tea Party Whiteys will miss their God-given opportunity to draw even more of White Humanity to them.  Once our People see a political movement that explicitly promotes our interests and fights against our enemies, then we can have hope, but not until.  As the economy worsens, the time ripens for our White Rising. </p>
<p>White Humanity can be fooled into all sorts of dispossession when times are good and prosperity is wide-spread, but no longer will our enemies so easily convince us to ignore the iron laws of nature- we&rsquo;re suffering too much to embrace Diversity.  We just can&rsquo;t afford race insanity any longer, and some of us are waking up to that fact.</p>

		<p>One of the other things Coates said in passing, relevant to Missouri and its Senate election, is that current Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, the Democrat nominee, refused to follow DOJ Voting Rights division edicts to clear the Missouri voter rolls of dead people.  Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t do that, because corrupt black poll workers voting in lieu of the dead person is how Democrats win close elections in this state and in many other states.</p>

		<p>I vote in Atlanta, God&rsquo;s shame on me. I&rsquo;ve never voted here without knowing that the majority black votes would nullify my White Rights.</p>
<p>QD- &#8220;because corrupt black poll workers voting in lieu of the dead person is how Democrats win close elections in this state and in many other states.&#8221;</p>
<p>You should see the big, fat, sloppy black poll workers in Atlanta, or as our mullato rap loving former mayor Franklin renamed it, &#8220;The ATL&#8221;.</p>
<p>Privileged looking White businessmen walk into the polling place and encounter these voodoo-fros.  We are being laughed at.  Those blacks know that they will nullify our votes either through machine malfunction, or just voting several times themselves. Blacks are smarter than Whites- they see votes as bullets, and we see votes as rights.<br>

<p>There has to be literally dozens upon dozens of non-white-hating-whites who know of this policy who work in and around the Congress and this administration, yet not a single one of them had the guts to jump up and yell fire, as he should have, until the two involved in this whistle blowing finally spoke up. </p>
<p>This anti-white attitude is rife throughout this administration, and it consists of people who are severely emotionally and mentally ill or severely troubled.   However, this same mindset was prevalent throughout the DOJ in prior Republican administrations as well.  We&rsquo;ve never had a political party that has looked out for white rights. </p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s this idiot community organizer trying to convince everybody that non-whites created and settled this nation and were here first, or whether it&rsquo;s the multiculturalists actively encouraging the importation of third world hordes who are proven anti-America haters, the country is slowly being shifted out of the hands of whites and into non-white control.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, if they were to succeed as much as they would like, they would be hating and fighting with each other instead of whitey, and the entire lot of them would be constantly embroiled in one kind of conflict or another, until civil war occurred.</p>
<p>We MUST break apart by any means necessary and start over with our own country.  That&rsquo;s the only way some semblence of America will ever survive.</p>
<p>This empire is a complete and total failure.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately there is nothing in this testimony that is surprising.  As Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the Commission on Civil Rights, has said, &#8220;Civil rights laws were not passed to protect the rights of white men and do not apply to them.&#8221;  The Justice Department is simply following her lead.<br>

		<p>Now let&rsquo;s think about this for a moment.  </p>
<p>Former Voting Section Chief Christopher Coates, a man that worked to ensure that Blacks could amass political power, is now confused because a black US President and the other blacks in that government will not protect the voting rights of WHITE voters.  </p>
<p>So what is he missing here, what are we missing here?  Whites gave the country to the blacks.  Whites bent over backwards since the end of WW 2 to DISENFRANCHISE themselves.  What did he, you, we, think they were going to do?  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise in this.  If the non-whites knew how stupid and weak white people really are they would pour into the streets and kill every one of you.  And don&rsquo;t think that they aren&rsquo;t thinking about that very thing every day.  <br>

		<p>Looking at this travesty of justice from afar (the UK) I would imagine the following comments from Department of inJustice officials and from Attorney General Loretta King ought to be enough to blow the lid clean off the whole farcical race-relations scam in the USA and finally open the eyes of slumbering white people: </p>
<p>&#8220;Coates also testified that he was reprimanded by Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King when he asked attorneys in job interviews {snip} if they were willing to enforce the law in a racially neutral fashion, regardless of the race of the wrongdoer, even if the wrongdoer was black &hellip; King wanted like-minded attorneys who were corruptly willing to turn a blind eye toward racial discrimination committed by national racial minorities. Soon thereafter, Coates was stripped of his power even to interview applicants .. . He testified, as I did, that Justice Department attorneys and staff flatly refused to work on cases where the wrongdoer was black: &ldquo;[An attorney told Coates in] no uncertain terms that he had not come to the Voting Section to sue African American defendants&#8221;. </p>
<p>Like the UK with it&rsquo;s ant-white Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) genocidal dispossession of whites in the nations they created is what this whole Marxist/globalist equality farce has always been about. Anti-globalist white people in the USA need to work tirelessly to ensure that these black racists and their government enablers are brought to justice and the whole stinking edifice of Cultural Marxism/political correctness is consigned to the dustbin of  history.</p>

<p>Conrad what you say is true in MOST places but not all. I live in the rural south and trust me the Whites around here are NOT weak, they are heavily armed and would kill an assailant just as easily as look at them. It is the first time in my life that I am surrounded by strong White men and it is a wonderful thing indeed.</p>
