<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/7/dc-mayor-race-defined-by-race/">D.C. Mayor Race Defined by Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Simmons, Washington Times, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The three leading candidates seeking the Democratic Party nod to be the next mayor of Washington are black, yet the issue of race and racial divisions remains an inescapable theme in the campaign as voters prepare for Tuesday&rsquo;s primaries.</p>
<p>Polls show a deep racial divide in the electorate, with the city&rsquo;s minority white population strongly favoring Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and blacks swinging toward D.C. Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray. Mr. Gray is seen as the front-runner in the race.</p>
<p>The third-place Democrat in the primary, Leo Alexander, said Monday that race will remain a huge issue in the predominantly black city until D.C. leaders address the &#8220;blatantly obvious&#8221; problems linked to abject poverty.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray injected the race issue into the campaign again Monday, telling reporters that Mr. Fenty&rsquo;s Cabinet does not reflect the racial makeup of the city &#8220;by virtue of his own appointments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Gray then noted that the top three positions in public education  &mdash;  the deputy mayor for education, the schools chancellor and the school superintendent  &mdash;  as well as the police chief, fire chief and attorney general, are not black.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can there not be one African-American leader in that cluster?&#8221; Mr. Gray asked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Fenty, who has struggled to connect in the campaign with voters in heavily black wards of the city, has said repeatedly while campaigning that he makes appointments based on individual qualifications, not race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor cites the new and newly renovated schools, libraries and recreation centers that were built east of the Anacostia River, where the mostly black population faces jobless rates that are two to three times higher than the citywide rate of 9.8 percent.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fenty&rsquo;s outreach still has left him trailing in the polls in his quest for a second four-year term, and the surveys of Democratic voters reveal a yawning racial gap.</p>
<p>According to a Clarus telephone poll of 501 Democrats conducted Aug. 15-16, Mr. Fenty had a 42-percentage-point lead among whites, while Mr. Gray had a 38-point lead among blacks. Mr. Gray was elected to the D.C. Council in 2005 and became chairman two years later.</p>
<p>The polls also reveal a stark racial divide in favorability ratings for the two lead candidates. Mr. Gray is viewed favorably by 70 percent of the city&rsquo;s blacks, but by just 39 percent of the city&rsquo;s white voters. In contrast, Mr. Fenty&rsquo;s favorability rating is much stronger among whites (63 percent) than among blacks (33 percent).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander cited poverty as the root cause of the race and class divisions, and said Hispanics are the &#8220;new people on the block being exploited&#8221; by politicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics and other immigrants are being exploited,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Crime and higher taxes are widening the economic gap.&#8221;<br>

Face facts. Race is the only thing blacks have to work with.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the smarts to devise and implement solutions. What solutions they propose are race-based and they always fail (Ex. busing and anything to do with school reform). </p>

		<p>-that race will remain a huge issue in the predominantly black city until D.C. leaders address the &ldquo;blatantly obvious&rdquo; problems linked to abject poverty.</p>
<p>Well then, please allow me to address what some of these &#8220;blatantly obvious&#8221; problems are - tons of out of wedlock children, large school drop out rates, entitlement attitudes, way overblown sense of self worth, idealizing thug mentality, intense self hatred that translates to jealousy and hatred of all others that are successful -especially WHITE successful people, a mindset geared toward destruction. Yes, this &#8220;coward&#8221; would love to be able to honestly address some of these &#8220;problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hispanics and other immigrants are being exploited,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd that they&rsquo;re being &#8220;exploited&#8221; but yet they not only don&rsquo;t leave, MORE of them keep coming. They hide in the &#8220;shadows&#8221; to avoid going back to THEIR OWN countries!           <br>

		<p>Blacks will never lose the stigma as uncontrollable racists until they elect a white conservative mayor of D.C.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t happened so far, because most blacks despise whites even though whites have bent over backwards being more than fair to them.  Blacks constantly give the impression that they are so evil and hateful they care nothing about anything or anyone but blacks and frivolous black causes the world over, not just in this country.</p>
<p>But before they can give consideration outside themselves they first must be able to reduce their unreasonable, despicable hatred of other races and be able to take care of themselves without looking to the whiteman for handouts.  And, unfortunately, that will never happen, because they just don&rsquo;t have the ability or intelligence to live on their own.</p>
<p>If proof is needed, just look at Africa and every black run government in the US.  It&rsquo;s really a sad, sad situation.</p>

They accused him of &#8220;airing their dirty laundry&#8221; in public.<br>
I would suggest that the &#8220;laundry&#8221; has been dirty for the past 60 years and is due for a &#8220;cleaning&#8221;.<br>

		<p>I was born in Washington and lived in the suburbs there for many years. I haven&rsquo;t been there since 1988, and I&rsquo;m surprised that there are any white people still living within the DC city limits. DC is a notoriously dangerous city with hundreds of murders every year and extremely tough schools. Many of the suburbs are almost as bad. </p>

<p>The one politician in the group who is telling the truth. He must be really desperate. </p>
<p>Interesting that this policitian admits Hispanics are being artificially held down (there&rsquo;s only so much racial spoils to be had and these are all grandfathered in to blacks, seemingly forever and ever held with an iron death-grip). What he doesn&rsquo;t say, but the implication is there, is that whites can be artificially held down or stunted to. Easy as pie, or the latest &#8216;diversity&rsquo; decree. </p>

<p>Ms Rhee&rsquo;s boyfriend, Kevin Johnson, is also Sacramento mayor.  There are allegations that Rhee was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.  I didn&rsquo;t think Koreans and blacks got along too well, but in this case true love conquers all. </p>

 <br>
In 2008 there were 186 murders in Washington, DC.  This was down from 482 in 1991.  <br>
 <br>
In 2008 the murder rate in Washington, DC was 31.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.  In 1991 it was 80.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. <br>
 <br>
Things are getting better, even though Washington, DC is still a dangerous city.  In 1960 there were 81 murders there.  The murder rate was 10.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. <br>

		<p>Michelle Rhee used to have a white husband but they got divorced.  When you see a pic of her, you wonder how ANY man of ANY race would want her, given that she has a permanent facial expression of &#8220;You&rsquo;re fired!&#8221;</p>
<p>In NYC the Koreans and the blacks have zero interactions, anywhere, which holds tru for virtually all asians out here.  How come they can get away with that and no one has called them on that?</p>

<p>What is blatantly obvious is that you can have a quiet, clean, orderly, low crime neighborhood with good schools and turn it into a noisy, trash ridden, broken down, crime filled neighborhood with hopelessly bad schools just by adding enough blacks.  I wish this was not so but this has been empirically demonstrated time and time again.</p>

		<p>Thomas S.  awesome observation. Blacks love freebies and when they feel they can&rsquo;t get them they cry foul about slavery. My place of employment was made up of 35% blacks in an all white area. Can you imagine a neighborhood made up of blacks with a 35% white work force?  The majority of those getting fired and rehired are blacks.   One final thought, the blacks in charge of hiring are not hiring whites, and no organization exists to file a complaint.</p>

<p>Interesting.  It is often the case that women &#8220;climbed the ladder&#8221; using the power of their man.  The fact that this women now finds her ticket to ride with a black man is telling.  Of course, within the context of DC politics, and especially in our Obama era, what else can be expected? </p>
<p>I suspect that blacks are very uncomfortable with a tough-minded Korean woman telling them how to &#8220;educate&#8221; their children.  And God knows what the teachers unions think about it all.  I don&rsquo;t know if Rhee can effectively use her marriage to an ex-NBA (and corrupt) Californian politician as leverage within the DC black community.  I suspect that deep-down inside blacks hold her with contempt, and see her (and her kind) as corrupting to the black man.  As I said, interesting dynamics.</p>

		<p>Two items. First, Rhee is a one person unemployment machine for black &#8220;educators.&#8221; Enrollment in DC schools is falling along with test scores and her solution is to fire lots of people, most of whom are black. Many of these folk have no economic atternative.Blacks in DC understand the true nature of education  &mdash;  jobs.</p>
<p>Second, like Nicole Brown (O. J.&rsquo;s wife) Rhee is &#8220;stealing&#8221; a good black male. There is a huge shortage of decent black males in Washington and elsewhere and why should a non-black get one?   </p>

		<p>If the liberal argument about equality among the races is correct then there should be an equal number [proportionally] of successful cities, states, and countries which are being run exclusively by Blacks as are those being run exclusively by Whites and/or Asians. Not only is that not the case but, help me here, is there ANYTHING being run by Blacks which either has been or currently is being run successfully   &mdash;   some obscure High School basketball team perhaps   &mdash;   somewhere in Texas or Haiti?  If so, could someone please point it out to me!</p>
<p>In my view there are none whatsoever and moreover, the Mulatto Prez we now have, if given enough time would put our whole country in the same economic condition as Zimbabweans now find themselves today! Tell me what can one buy in Zimbabwee for 10,000,000,000,000? Ans: Maybe an egg! Furthermore, doesn&rsquo;t Washington D.C. get unlimited federal money?</p>
<p>In two years the interest on Barry&rsquo;s debt alone will be more than our total defense budget is today! We are talking about a lot of money here! </p>
<p>Speaking of Washington D.C., if it is so safe today then one would expect to see individual whites walking up and down it&rsquo;s streets, alone, late at night. After all, this is our nation&rsquo;s capitol isn&rsquo;t it? If one can&rsquo;t be safe here where on earth could one ever expect to be safe? </p>
<p>Politically incorrect Germans refer to D.C. as the roach motel. When I first heard this term in a guest house in Bonn years ago I assumed that they were talking about actual roaches. Not so! But they were correct!</p>

<p>Jay, it&rsquo;s more complicated than that.  Blacks everywhere still continue to stupidly believe that their greatest enemy is The Great White Bigot  &mdash;  even as they&rsquo;re being ethnically cleansed by hispanics, by force, out of LA and other &#8216;traditional&rsquo; black areas.</p>
<p>Read on:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Michelle Rhee, Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools, is portrayed in a recent Education Next puff piece as a modern day Braveheart in high heels because of the way she ruthlessly chops the jobs of union teachers.</p>
<p>The rumor mill has it that most of the teachers who were cut were black women over the age of 40. </p>
<p>First, a shortage of teachers is declared. Rhee was hired by DCPS to solve the shortage. But many feel that chancellor Michele Rhee caused the shortage by firing teachers because it served the purpose of her former organization (Teach for America) which was supposedly going to solve a shortage problem that didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sure bet that Rhee, who was born in the USA to South Korean immigrants, will be hiring mostly Asians.</p>
<p>The replacing of American teachers with Filipinos in Louisiana with the recent firings of teachers in Washington DC. </p>
<p>According to the federal government&rsquo;s Foreign Labor Certification Data Center, D.C. Public Schools submitted 46 labor condition applications in 2007 and 2008, giving Rhee authority to import hundreds of foreign teachers on H1B visas without having to make any attempt to find eligible Americans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am seeing and have seen this same tactic in Los Angeles  &mdash;  filipino teachers brought in on Visas to fill a so-called teacher shortage.  Many speak little or unintelligible English and from what I can tell, they are being sent to the worst schools.  </p>
<p>The unions?  Bought off or in bed with the administration.  Black politicians?  Pounding the podium about the need for more food stamps, more welfare, more dependency while screaming about The Great White Bigot that continues to &#8216;keep down people of color.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I swear these people are their own worst enemy.  </p>
<p>If you click on the link here: http://tinyurl.com/22tweq5    You&rsquo;ll find  a photo (shopped) image of the South Korean warrior herself decked out as a mediaeval knight  &mdash;  you know the type found in WHITE European Cultures.</p>

		<p>Fenty is considered the &#8220;white candidate&#8221; while Gray- whose melanin is much more gray than Fenty&rsquo;s- is considered the &#8220;black candidate.&#8221;  The two most prominent members of Fenty&rsquo;s government are non-black: Education Chancellor Michelle Rhee, of Korean extraction, who just fired 250 of DC&rsquo;s worst teachers, all of whom are non-white; and white female Police Chief Cathy Lanier, who actually hails from the formerly poor white neighborhood of Tuxedo, Maryland, just over the District line.  </p>
<p>Fenty is regarded as a race traitor by many, if not most, of DC&rsquo;s blacks.  As the public schools in DC are regarded as 1) a jobs program and 2) a holding pen for DC&rsquo;s youths while their mothers are out working, DC&rsquo;s blacks despise the antics of Fenty&rsquo;s surrogate, Miss Rhee.  Ironically, Miss Rhee is engaged to former Phoenix Sun point guard Kevin Johnson, who is now Sacramento&rsquo;s mayor.  It is likely not to be a long distance marriage as it is very unlikely that Gray will retain Michelle Rhee as Chancellor.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Alexander cited poverty as the root cause of the race and class divisions&#8221;</p>
<p>NO Mr. Alexander! &#8220;Poverty&#8221; is an high level abstraction and not an entity that can cause anything else in the physical sense. He uses the term &#8220;poverty&#8221; to avoid saying &#8220;Blacks&#8221; as the root cause. To say &#8220;poverty&#8221; is like saying the &#8220;streets&#8221; cause crime instead of the people who do cause the problems in the streets. Simple semantics? </p>
<p>Since Blacks themselves control the politics of the District they have to turn to abstract bogeymen to blame for their own incompetence at maintaining a civil community. This fallacious way of thinking even has a name: reification (or hypostatization). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)</a>   Blacks have a habit of using reification quite often blaming abstract &#8220;racists&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; for most of their problems.</p>
