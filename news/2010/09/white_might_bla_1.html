<p>Few whites are aware of the nonsense that circulates about them among blacks. Ever since the days of the slave trade, when Africans were convinced that whites planned to eat them, to the present, when more than half of all blacks think that illegal drugs may be part of a genocidal plot, blacks have believed all sorts of foolishness about whites.</p>
<p>Patricia Turner, a black associate professor at the University of California at Davis, has looked into today&rsquo;s anti-white rumors and tries to explain why blacks  &mdash;  even successful, college-educated blacks  &mdash;  believe them. She says that they naturally expect the worst from whites because American society is so hopelessly racist that virtually any sort of white wickedness is plausible. Her book is therefore not just a study of credulity but also an exercise in it.</p>
<p><b>The Almighty Klan</b></p>

</table><p>One of the most persistent themes in the world of black rumors is the fearsome powers of the Ku Klux Klan. For example, during the 1980s and even up to the present, many blacks firmly believed that the Church&rsquo;s Fried Chicken fast food chain was owned by the Klan and that its food was doctored to sterilize black men. In 1984, a congressman actually had the FDA conduct mass spectrometry and gas chromatography tests on Church&rsquo;s chicken to see what was in it. Naturally, the FDA found nothing suspicious, but these results did not satisfy &#8220;the folk,&#8221; as Prof. Turner often calls blacks. Some of her informants explained that the Klan would have had no trouble persuading the FDA to lie about the tests.</p>
<p>Another recent Klan enterprise is said to have been the Troop Sport clothing company, which was founded in 1985 and sold 95 percent of its clothes to blacks and Hispanics. The Troop name reportedly stood for &#8220;To Rule Over Oppressed People,&#8221; and the linings of shoes and jackets were supposed to contain messages like &#8220;Thank you, nigger, for making us rich.&#8221; Some young blacks who wore Troop clothes despite the rumor and subsequent boycott were attacked as traitors by other blacks.</p>
<p>Troop spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to fight the rumor. It hired the black singing group Gladys Night and the Pips to improve its image and posted anti-Klan posters in stores. The campaign failed and Troop went bankrupt, though the company denied that the boycott was the cause.</p>
<p>Prof. Turner tells us that the most recent alleged Klan front has been the Brooklyn Bottling Company, which sells a soda called Tropical Fantasy. Like Church&rsquo;s chicken, the soda was said to be laced with a drug that would selectively sterilize black men. There is no odorless, tasteless substance that sterilizes anyone, much less only black men, but the FDA duly trotted out its mass spectrometers and cleared Tropical Fantasy. The rumor was unaffected and caused serious losses for Brooklyn Bottling. It also provoked violence; blacks attacked delivery trucks and roughed up storekeepers who stocked Tropical Fantasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The folk&#8221; credit the Klan with many achievements. It is said to have killed John Kennedy and to be deeply involved in the tobacco business. The eponymous founders of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are both said to have been important Klan members (despite the fact that Philip Morris was British), and Kool menthol cigarettes are suspect because of the brand&rsquo;s ominous misspelling.</p>
<p>The Klan is likewise thought to have killed Martin Luther King, though the government may have helped. As one informant said, &#8220;I heard it was the FBI or the KKK  &mdash;  one of those groups.&#8221; Prof. Turner notes that for many of &#8220;the folk,&#8221; there is no real difference between the two.</p>
<p><b>Genocidal Government</b></p>
<p>If the Klan has fearsome powers, those of the United States government are more fearsome still. As noted earlier, more than half of all blacks are either convinced that the government supplies illegal drugs to blacks or that it might well be doing so. Many blacks think it was Ronald Reagan who started spreading guns and crack cocaine in black neighborhoods out of a deep-seated hatred for blacks.</p>
<p>One reason many of Prof. Turner&rsquo;s informants give for believing that the government is spreading illegal drugs is their complete confidence in its ability to keep them out of the country. Since there are drugs in America it must mean that the government lets them in so that blacks will take them and kill each other.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was said to be behind the Atlanta child murders of the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that period 28 young blacks were killed before a black was finally convicted of the crimes. Even today, the conviction is commonly thought to have been a frame-up. The CDC employed the FBI to do the killings, because an essential ingredient for the manufacture of wonder drugs could be obtained only by extracting it from the sex organs of young blacks. The comedian Dick Gregory helped promote this rumor.</p>

</table><p>Many blacks, including the actor Bill Cosby, also believe that AIDS was invented by the government in order to kill blacks. Prof. Turner herself isn&rsquo;t quite sure what to believe. She finds it ominous that when government agencies deny that they invented the virus they argue that bio-engineering is too primitive for that. She hints darkly that this may mean that the government might just spread deadly diseases among blacks if only it knew how.</p>
<p>Suspicions about drugs and AIDS are so widespread and so ridiculous that they have broken into the news but there are always other rumors on the go among &#8220;the folk&#8221; that whites rarely hear.</p>
<p>The Reebok shoe company funnels its profits to South Africa to prop up apartheid. Whites adopt Latin American babies to kill them and harvest their organs for transplants. George Bush started the Gulf war because there are so many blacks in the military. Colonel Sanders stole his Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe from a black cook who worked for his parents. The offices of Planned Parenthood are located in black neighborhoods to keep blacks from reproducing. The police deliberately let the Los Angeles riots get out of hand so that blacks and Hispanics would look bad on television. Clothing designer Liz Claiborne said on the Oprah Winfrey television program that she didn&rsquo;t like to see black people wearing her clothes. Miss Claiborne has never been on that program, but many blacks threw out their Liz Claiborne dresses. Whites are always up to some kind of mischief.</p>
<p><b>Explanations</b></p>
<p>Why do blacks believe this nonsense? Whites usually look for a rational explanation. When a company is said to be trying to sterilize blacks, its officers suspect that a competitor is trying to do them down. When the government is accused of wanting to kill blacks, the CIA and the United States Information Agency go looking for Communist propaganda.</p>
<p>Prof. Turner is probably right to argue that this sort of thinking is a waste of time. &#8220;The folk&#8221; are sufficiently credulous and sufficiently ill-disposed towards whites to cook up and swallow rumors without any outside help. Prof. Turner does not quite put it this way. She says that whites have been and continue to be so implacably racist that any kind of anti-black evil is plausible even if scientifically impossible.</p>
<p>The first part of her book is therefore full of ancient Klan atrocities that are supposed to justify today&rsquo;s delusions, and the rest is sprinkled with the usual assumptions about contemporary white wickedness: random blacks are often beaten up while the police look the other way, television promotes anti-black stereotypes, the government is hostile to blacks, whites won&rsquo;t hire blacks, the police persecute blacks, etc. In Prof. Turner&rsquo;s world, affirmative action does not exist and it is always necessary to assume that whites are racists.</p>
<p>Her assumptions about sex take us deeper still into the world of black delusion. For example, we learn that the early Ku Klux Klan was primarily motivated by a sense of sexual inferiority coupled with latent homosexual desires for black men. Southern whites called blacks &#8220;boy&#8221; in unconscious acknowledgment of their Ganymead attractions, and lynched them because of this unbearable, suppressed homosexual lust. We also learn that Ku Kluxers stuffed wads of paper down their pants before they went calling on blacks so as not to appear insufficiently endowed.</p>
<p>Current anti-white rumors, Prof. Turner repeatedly points out, are filled with sexual elements: the KKK is trying to sterilize blacks, AIDS will exterminate blacks because it is sexually transmitted, white doctors need to extract something from black sex organs, etc. She stops just short of saying that all this is evidence of sexual obsessiveness <em>on the part of whites.</em></p>
<p>Prof. Turner cannot bring herself to admit that black beliefs are aberrant or deplorable. Though she concedes that they may be tough on innocent companies that are smeared, she thinks goofy rumors are <em>good</em> for blacks. Believe it or not, rumors are &#8220;tools of resistance&#8221; because the catharsis of naming oppressors  &mdash;  such as the Klan and the FBI  &mdash;  gives blacks &#8220;a sense of power&#8221; and &#8220;contributes to an atmosphere of communal problem-solving.&#8221; &#8220;Sharing the rumor and joining the boycott,&#8221; says Prof. Turner, &#8220;enables individuals to perceive themselves as powerful.&#8221; What must Prof. Turner think of blacks if she really believes that swallowing preposterous nonsense &#8220;contributes to an atmosphere of communal problem-solving&#8221;?</p>
<p>The truth about these rumors is more stark and unpleasant than Prof. Turner seems to think. If today&rsquo;s blacks think their government is trying to kill them or that the KKK can tell the FDA what to put into a report, they will believe anything. Of course, foreign correspondents in Africa stagger back to civilization with reports more amazing than these: sorcerers who can steal a man&rsquo;s genitals with a handshake, religious fanatics who believe they can walk on water  &mdash;  and then drown en masse, witches who call down lightening and must be burned to death. Africans are champions of credulity, ripe for rumor, superstition, and nonsense.</p>
<p>Another element in these rumors that escapes Prof. Turner&rsquo;s notice is the implied omnipotence of the white man. Whites <em>could</em> stop illegal drugs if they wanted, or invent viruses, or sterilize black men, or prevent riots, or just about anything else. &#8220;The folk,&#8221; on the other hand, are dolts who, with a little coaxing, can be made to buy shoes, eat fried chicken, take drugs, shoot each other, and get AIDS. This is powerful commentary on how blacks really see themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, a message that whites ignore at their peril is the implication of what <em>blacks</em> would want to do to a minority in their midst. Do not their delusions of genocide reflect their own desires and fantasies? Whether it be Idi Amin&rsquo;s massacres or South African necklacings or corpses by the truckload in Burundi, Africans often make short and bloody work of their tribal enemies.</p>
<p>Much as she tries to blame &#8220;the folk&rsquo;s&#8221; fantastic beliefs on white racism, Prof. Turner unwittingly points to the depths from which they flow.</p>

<p>The issue of December 18th contains 13 ads for astrologers and eight for spiritualists. One of the more flamboyant advertisers is Rev. James, whose motto is &#8220;See him in the afternoon, be happy at night.&#8221; He claims to have helped &#8220;many thousands of people who have been crossed, have spells, can&rsquo;t hold money, want luck, want their loved ones back, want to stop nature problems [?] or want to get rid of strange sickness.&#8221; &#8220;Satisfaction doubly guaranteed,&#8221; says Rev.

		<p>Most Blacks really have no clue about how the world works. It&rsquo;s all really like magic to them. They don&rsquo;t understand science and have no knowledge or interest of history. They live in the moment as perpetual children, able to use the most basic of our apparatuses, but with little understanding about how or why they do the things they do. </p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t read the article, because I don&rsquo;t want to be disappointed that they twist the good news and turn it into bad news for White Humanity: &#8220;Our work is unfinished and we need to do more to foce White babies to atone for the sins of segretation by teaching them how to demand that their parents send their college money to save starving Africans.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s odd that they didn&rsquo;t mention the plot that involves porcine tapeworms. According to the tale, dastardly racists have been spraying water laden with porcine tapeworm eggs onto food in buffets in Black neighborhoods. The PH balance of the human digestive system is too acidic for this species of tapeworm to survive, so the microscopic embryos migrate into the bloodstream and settle in the eyes or the brain of their host. There they remain in embryonic form and often grow to the size of a chicken egg. The embryos must be surgically removed. </p>
<p>I suspect that they didn&rsquo;t mention this fact-based conspiracy theory because they didn&rsquo;t want to spread this information to the crazies. </p>

		<p>One common theory among blacks is the whole bit of the CIA running in drugs.  (Which actually might have been true, or might still be true, to an extent).  Lucky for them, this is a very easy conspiracy to defeat:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use those drugs.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>

		<p>I remember when the Liz Claiborn thing happened.  The media interviewed blacks at the protest.  One reporter asked a black female protester, &#8220;Are you aware that Liz Claiborn was never even on the Oprah Winfrey Show?&#8221;  The black woman replied that she knew; in fact, she had even sent for a videotape of Oprah&rsquo;s program for the day that Liz was supposed to have been on, and someone else was the guest that day.  &#8220;So why are you out here protesting?&#8221; the reporter asked.  &#8220;Well, if there&rsquo;s a rumor that Liz said it, she probably did,&#8221; the black woman replied.  Facts, be d***ed, I suppose!  A &#8220;rumor&#8221; is enough to try and ruin some whitey&rsquo;s business.  Things like this used to surprise and puzzle me, but not anymore.  It&rsquo;s just how most blacks are.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I really should read the entire article prior to posting comments.  Oh well.</p>
<p>Historical fact -  Margaret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood with the stated intention of keeping blacks from reproducing.  She even verbalized that goal.  So, it would seem &#8216;the folk&rsquo; have that one correct and probably should be suspicious of a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic on every block.  As we can see when traveling any city in the U.S. however, Ms. Sanger&rsquo;s plan had either failed miserably, been overwhelmed or simply charged too much for the suck and flush service.  You blew it, Ms. Sanger, and not in a good way.  </p>
<p>As far as what &#8216;the folk&rsquo; plan to do when they finally reach majority, just read blogs like &#8216;South Africa Sucks&rsquo; on a daily basis and tally the number of whites murdered.  Murder all the white farmers, seize their land, then do absolutely nothing.  It is no wonder they are beginning to have food shortages there.</p>

		<p>A few thoughts,,,</p>
<p>What we are really seeing here is projectionism. Blacks are projectionists, throwing onto others their own base thoughts and impulses. This is particularly disturbing on black thoughts on White &#8220;genocide&#8221; of them. Likewise the black track record is worrisome. Whereever blacks assumed power they acted on these impulses. Look at what happened to the Indo-Pakistanis in African countries.</p>
<p>One other thing that went unmentioned here is black belief in Voodoo and other superstitions. Quite a few of them believe in this. This is particularly true in the West Indies. </p>

		<p>A lot of their goofy rumours paint the whites as being evil. They have to belief that the white man is evil, as this in turn implies that they are good. </p>
<p>They are predisposed to think certain hateful thoughts towards whites, thus it is logical that they would look for ways to justify these thoughts, hence the &#8220;evil whitey&#8221; rumours.</p>
<p>If these &#8220;evil whitey&#8221; rumours did not exist, they might have had to ask themselves; &#8220;why do they hate whitey without just cause?&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth might be to hard for them to face and this truth is that they have hateful thoughts towards whites, that are totally unwarranted, which implies that they are the evil ones.</p>
<p>These &#8220;evil whitey&#8221; rumours are symptoms of their inability to face up to what they really are and serve as an excuse to continue to hate the white man.</p>

<p>2) Disregarding the search for a real killer and subsequently distributing vials of &#8220;Blood Type OJ&#8221; for fellow officers to spread as evidence</p>
<p>3) Pricing dolls higher to lower blacks monetary powers</p>
<p>4) Pricing dolls lower to lower blacks self-esteem</p>
<p>5) Placement of charges on the levee to take advantage of the incoming Katrina</p>
<p>6) Assigning military clad members to stand outside of voting area with nightsticks to intimidate voters. Huh?</p>

I lived in Brooklyn in the &rsquo;90s, and although virtually none of my friends or acquaintances was black, I heard those rumors about Tropical Fantasy. The way I heard it was the secret ingredient was saltpeter; and although the substance would supposedly lower the sperm count in ALL males, it was still &#8220;a racist plot&#8221; by &#8220;The Man&#8221; against black reproduction because Tropical Fantasy was a brand consumed mostly by minorities. </p>
<p>Of course, I knew all this was nothing but paranoid ghetto nonsense   &mdash;   a &#8220;tropical fantasy&#8221;, if you like   &mdash;   but regarded it as an isolated incident. But as this article reveals, the Brooklyn Bottling fiasco was NOT an isolated incident, but merely another entry in A VERY LONG LIST of incredibly stupid, easily disproven, and socially <i>harmful</i> paranoid ghetto nonsense. </p>
<p>That America has large, swarthy swaths of the population suffering from a race-based persecution complex and lacking the intellectual abilities to separate fact from fantasy, is regrettable. What is worse is that we have &#8220;academics&#8221; from that group, like this Patricia Turner, rationalizing it all away; and excusing this reprehensible behavior as an understandable reaction to the racism that African-Americans experience from living under the white supremacy of the blah blah blah&hellip; </p>

		<p>&#8220;A lot of their goofy rumours paint the whites as being evil. They have to belief that the white man is evil, as this in turn implies that they are good&#8221;. </p>
<p>True, but I don&rsquo;t think this is just blacks. Perhaps this is where it started, but the whole of anthropology, sociology and &#8216;history&rsquo; seems dedicated to the idea that whites are bad white primitives, excuse me, the unsoiled, are morally superior. People just are looking for white misdeeds, and sometimes interprete even kindness or differences as discrimination. Witness the recent Doll story on AmRen? If the black doll is on sale at a lower price, this is racism, against people of color. If the white doll is on sale at a lower price, this is racism against people of color. I think this translates into the real world far too often. Wilmot Robertson observed something like, &#8220;What is it like to be hated, not for your vices but your virtues? To go on playing the game fairly with opponents who have long ago abandoned all the rules?</p>
<p>I think people who have suffered become more prone to superstition. Non-whites do often seem more superstitious than whites. Perhaps they are just getting in tune with their special vibrancy. These conspiracy ideas, though, have gone beyond just misunderstandings. For the most part they are wilful attacks on white people and their societies. And unwillingness to acknowledge this almost seems to be a form of &#8216;denial&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Perhaps all racial interaction is really some kind of &#8216;race-war&rsquo; and whites have yet to figure that out. After all non-whites can never be wrong, right?</p>

		<p>&#8220;One common theory among blacks is the whole bit of the CIA running in drugs. (Which actually might have been true, or might still be true, to an extent). Lucky for them, this is a very easy conspiracy to defeat: Don&rsquo;t use those drugs&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on Rush Limbaugh but Limbaugh has claimed pretty much the same thing. Interesting that Limbaugh doesn&rsquo;t combat the CIA - drug rumor. He doesn&rsquo;t give it credence but he doesn&rsquo;t deny it either (from what I&rsquo;ve heard). When he had his own TV show, once he claimed, &#8220;Our college newspapers. They&rsquo;re run by communists&#8221;. Looks like they graduated Patricia Turner. </p>

		<p>Actually, there is a substance  &mdash;  gossypol, found in cottonseed oil  &mdash;  that causes sterility in men. I believe the Chinese investigated it as a male contraceptive. I will leave it to someone else to remark on the irony of where this substance comes from. </p>

		<p>15 Anon:</p>
<p>I was almost a daily viewer to Rush&rsquo;s TV show when it existed, and I have a good memory, so I can provide what I think is the answer.  But when the CIA-drug story broke in the San Jose Mercury-News, I had two initial reactions that I really haven&rsquo;t changed to this day:  (1)  The one I said in Post #6.  (2)  Even if it&rsquo;s true, I really didn&rsquo;t mind.  After all, a lot of these black drug addicts were using government welfare money to buy this &#8220;CIA-trucked in&#8221; crack and heroin, and if the CIA was using that money to fund its black hat/black suitcase/black budget (no pun intended) affairs, then all it seemed me was going on was that the Feds were recouping some of their own money, i.e. in effect hiding the CIA black budget under the welfare budget.  Better that than &#8220;$400 screwdrivers&#8221; and &#8220;$800 toilet seats&#8221; as fronts for the CIA&rsquo;s off-budget secret expenses.</p>
<p>A few days later, Rush took it up on TV.  He had the same reaction I did about not taking the drugs as an easy way to beat this &#8220;conspiracy,&#8221; but didn&rsquo;t say anything about my second reaction.  I don&rsquo;t think Rush believed it, because he used the semantic vehicle of &#8220;even if this is true,&#8221; i.e. he didn&rsquo;t believe it, but grant it is for the sake of discussion.  So for outward consumption, he thinks it isn&rsquo;t but you might be right   &mdash;   He might have dropped enough clues in other venues to lead you think that he would tell you that the CIA was probably running drugs if you got him in private and off the record.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, Rush used to denounce people who researched and opposed extremist hate groups like the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) as &#8220;JBS conspiracy kooks.&#8221;  (Inside gossip   &mdash;   The Limbaughs are from southeast Missouri, and a lot of the family were Birchers.  Rush&rsquo;s antipathy toward the JBS is probably more a personal reaction to his being the &#8220;black sheep&#8221; of the family for the longest time (i.e. no college degree, not a lawyer like the rest of them), than anything else.  Never discount the personal motive.)  But now, after Dr. Angelo Codevilla wrote that essay (soon to be book) about the ruling class, it&rsquo;s acceptable in the his universe to denounce the CFR, as he does it all the time now.  Though it&rsquo;s using the Codevilla phraseology instead of a JBS-style set of word choices, though as far as that goes, to-MAY-toe, to-MAH-toe.  </p>

		<p>1. These &#8220;ghetto rumors&#8221; strike me as nothing more than an attempt by uneducated, simple tribesmen to understand a world they cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>2. The &#8220;CIA runs dope into the ghetto&#8221; rumor probably has some basis in truth, if you recall what Air America was hauling around Southeast Asia during the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>It is not only blacks who believe the &#8220;AIDS was Engineered&#8221; conspiracy theory.  A well-educated (Master&rsquo;s in Social Science plus a law degree) (and yes, you could argue that these are not real science degrees, but I digress) white South African woman of my acquaintance firmly believes it also.  This, because the virus was &#8220;too perfect&#8221;, working as it did on Black Africans&rsquo; inability to control their impulses, their hypersexuality, their childlike tendency to live in the day.  Maybe in response to the failure of aid programs to do anything but increase their numbers, she said, they invented the AIDS virus to do demographic catch-up work for Mother Nature, after having thwarted her by blunting the impact of famines and ailments on people who cannot control their own development.  She also firmly believed, having lived among them her entire life, that the virus had jumped species through sex and not through the eating of bush meat.</p>

		<p>There was a black racist on KDIA radio(Oakland, CA) a lot of years ago named Donald Warden,you may be aware of him. He goes by the name Mansour now, and is in Chicago,headquarters of the racist Nation of Islam.  He once said that the Neutron Bomb would be used on blacks if one of their riots got out of control.  Not too many years ago, he said that Whitey was waiting and seeing what blacks would do,and maybe he would eliminate them.  He approved of the murder of Oakland School Superintendent Marcus Foster by the idiot SLA.  On his radio show, he had nothing but approval by blacks  .He had only one hostile caller, a Jewish man whom questioned his criticism of Israeli actions.  He was extremely rude to him.  He was an attorney for Saudi Arabia,ranked the second worst violator of human rights, only after North Korea. </p>

		<p>I remember when as a student at the U of Mn I wandered in a minority area and  saw evidence of the superstition, in the form of a broadsheet stapled to a telephone post which hysterically announced that &#8220;Aids&#8221; is &#8220;in the drugs&#8221; and of course the drugs were distributed by the government. In other words there is no such thing as a virus; it is all make believe. Evil, darkly white scientists are busy injecting Aids into crack, weed and whatnot. I grant that no-one really trusts the bio-police all that much; they can turn on us anytime and who would know? But the primitively frightening message sort of got to me. Is it asking too much to think maybe the government indeed is behind all this?</p>
<p>I mean in the sense they are printing up the posters. What a breakthrough in disinformation!</p>

		<p>One thing whites should be very careful of is the grain of truth in these &#8220;rumors&#8221;.  Our crazy, crazy government is basically capable of anything.  And has engaged in large scale ethnic cleansing, primarily against whites, but also, recently against blacks (Los Angeles) using the criminality of non-white racial groups.</p>
<p>Think about this.  Blacks, since WWII (and probably earlier) were used as a biological warfare weapon to remove ethnic whites from the cities, mix them together, strip them of their white ethnicities and create generic &#8220;white people&#8221;.  They must have had some awareness of what they were being used for.  And they identify the government with &#8220;white people&#8221;.  So any rumor that comes along, seems completely plausible when they know what &#8220;white people&#8221; (government) is capable of.</p>
<p>Here is the really bad part.  Every once in awhile, they are right.</p>

		<p>The whole idea of victim-hood depends on and thus fosters the various conspiracy theories that run rampant in the black community.  They see themselves as helpless victims of white conspiracies because they can then justify their own aberrant behavior in the name of &#8220;resistance&#8221; to the white power structure.  One thing I have observed about blacks having lived and worked in close proximity to them for the past 25 years is that they always follow very predictable patterns of behavior.  One such pattern is the justification pattern&hellip;&#8221;I didn&rsquo;t really want to do it&hellip;the man MADE me do it!&#8221;, etc&hellip;  These nonsensical conspiracy theories are just a simplistic vehicle to justify their bad behavior.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this K paranoia firsthand during my lengthy employment with the Postal Service.  I&rsquo;ve never been and never plan to be in any K.  Still, there were Blacks in my workplace who were convinced I was in the K, to the point were one actually carved K letters on my timecard.  At about that time I was one of 3 Whites that were employed in my craft at my office out of about 25 employees.  I was also the union steward at that time.  When the thing with my timecard happened, I considered very seriously how I should respond to this and decided not to respond at all.  I did nothing to dispel this fantasy they had about me because those who believed it, believed they had something to fear from me and fear is the best deterrent to aggression. </p>

		<p>What I find amazing is the the &#8220;African&#8221; mindset of American blacks. Since the slave trade was banned in 1808, most blacks have been here for generations, but still think like Africans.</p>
<p>   American blacks do not believe that illness is caused by germ, viruses, ect. Illness is caused by someone casting a spell on them. I work in the mental health field, so this is often stated. Mind you, they become good patients because they believe the medicines prescribed are potions to ward off evil.</p>
<p>   One nurse told me that a black man who had a heart attack made a list of his enemies, trying to determine who cast the spell that caused the heart attack.</p>
<p>   Naturally, when you talk about prevention, exercise, and diet, they are baffled. How will that prevent evil spells from being cast.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m surprised the article didn&rsquo;t mention the Snapple fiasco, where some ill informed blacks believed that the Boston Tea Party, depicted on the fruit drink&rsquo;s label, actually portrayed a black slave ship. In addition, the &#8220;k&#8221; mark for kosher on the label indicated that Snapple was the official drink of the K! The controlled media encourages much of this black ignorance and resentment toward whites. The MSM doesn&rsquo;t do a good job of exposing and debunking these malicious anti-white rumors &mdash; such as AIDS was a CIA plot to exterminate blacks. </p>
