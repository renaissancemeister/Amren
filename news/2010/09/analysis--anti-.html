<h1><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE68D1Z520100914">Analysis  &mdash;  Anti-Immigrant Wave Spreads Across Europe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Noah Barkin, Reuters, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Few people outside of Germany paid much attention when a little-known Berlin politician named Rene Stadtkewitz convened a news conference last week and announced the formation of a new &#8220;Freedom&#8221; party.</p>
<p>But in the German capital, the founding of a movement modelled on the anti-immigrant party of Dutch populist Geert Wilders was a small political earthquake, whose tremors resonated in Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s office across town.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 45-year-old from the east Berlin district of Pankow [Stadtkewitz], who wants headscarves banned, mosques shuttered and state welfare payments to Muslims cut, is the newest face of a powerful anti-immigrant strain in European politics that is winning over voters and throwing mainstream politicians onto the defensive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But experts say public concerns about immigration have grown in the wake of the economic crisis and politicians across Europe are scrambling like never before to exploit these fears, breaking unwritten post-war taboos along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are witnessing is not a new trend, but a deepening and acceleration of something that was in place,&#8221; said Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations (Ifri) in Paris. &#8220;These politicians are playing with fire, because feelings on this issue run very deep and may not disappear when the economy recovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>THE END OF TOLERANCE</p>
<p>Wilders, who wants to ban the Koran and expel Muslims who commit crimes, has emerged in the span of a few months as arguably the most powerful politician in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>After an inconclusive June election, centre-right parties are relying on Wilders to form a minority government that could give him major sway over policy. If this coalition fails to come together and a new election is held, polls show his Freedom Party (PVV) would be the top vote getter.</p>
<p>In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy has taken pre-emptive action to prevent similar gains for the far-right National Front, announcing a crackdown on Roma people and criminals of foreign origin that has earned him rebukes from a United Nations human rights body and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>In Italy, which received the most immigrants of any EU country last year, Umberto Bossi&rsquo;s Northern League has wielded huge influence over domestic policy, pushing through tough laws that allow authorities to fine and imprison illegal immigrants, and even punish people who provide them with shelter.</p>
<p>Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society Institute in Brussels, says more European politicians are realising that by focussing on immigration, they can tap into voter fears about a range of issues  &mdash;  from the economy and jobs, to globalisation, change and an increasingly uncertain future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UPSETTING THE SYSTEM</p>
<p>One such country is Sweden, where an anti-immigrant party looks poised to vault the four percent hurdle in a September 19 election and enter parliament for the first time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rise of the new Left party and Greens in recent decades means that six parties now sit in the federal parliament in Berlin, a splintering that has severely complicated the formation of stable coalitions at the federal level.</p>
<p>Were a seventh party, led by Stadtkewitz or a more high-profile anti-immigrant crusader, to make it above the five percent threshold and enter the Bundestag it would shake Germany&rsquo;s political landscape to the core.</p>

<p>Really Comrade Dominique, who would have ever guessed?</p>
<p>Especially when elitist Marxists like yourself, have played with a similar fire for over 60 years. You and your fellow travelers, have in fact built a funeral pyre called &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; and made excuses for the: conquering alien, brazenly sadistic, and homicidally enraptured, elements of Third World that you have not just allowed into Europe&rsquo;s nations, but instead have viciously forced into them. You look the other way, or worse cover up the fact, that the children and young adults of Europe are being: beaten, raped, tortured, murdered, kidnapped, enslaved, and otherwise terrorized by these invaders. This is particularly true of the Muslim pirates and pillagers, that you claim practice a &ldquo;religion of peace&rdquo; and have only come to &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; your lands and labor forces.</p>
<p>If ending that kind of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; means that Europe is &ldquo;playing with fire&rdquo; Comrade Dominique, then I hope they also start playing with gasoline and even plutonium as well!</p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!</p>

		<p>phpWhile it might encourage us that White Humanity in Europe is now responding to the terrible waves of brown immigration, we shouldn&rsquo;t hold out hope that they will make a difference for themselves.  They voted in the socialist politicians who encouraged and profited from the immigration.   </p>
<p>The global forces will not permit natives&rsquo; taking back their countries.  If the nationalists gain enough ground to actual make a political and policy difference, look for something drastic, monumental, and shattering to happen as a response.</p>
<p>The enemies of White Humanity have come to far at overtaking our Western Civilization. They won&rsquo;t let a little nuisance like the democratic process halt their advances.</p>

		<p>Look at these leading captions:  &#8220;The End of Tolerance&#8221;, &#8220;Upsetting the System&#8221;, and more generally the term &#8220;anti-immigration wave&#8221;.</p>
<p>All this implies that there was previously a start to all these things.  &#8220;The Beginning of Tolerance&#8221; meant that bad things were inflicted upon an unwilling populace who had to learn to &#8220;tolerate&#8221;, as opposed to preserving the better former way.  &#8220;Upsetting the System&#8221; means that someone previously built such a bad system.  &#8220;Anti-immigration wave&#8221; means that there was previously a &#8220;pro-immigration wave&#8221; for no healthy reason whatsoever.<br/>

		<p>I think it is useful to always refer to the European population of Europe as &#8220;indigenous&#8221;.  Indigenous rights are something the left holds very dear to their hearts when they talk about non whites.  It makes it clear who are the victims and who are the invaders.  </p>

		<p>Could there be reason to hope for the survival of our people?  I sense the prevailing winds are changing direction, more rapidly than I would have imagined.  They will, I feel, gather significant force over the next decade and may, just may, be strong enough to clean out the non-white effluent that have polluted our lands these last forty years without the need for civil war and bloodshed.  I am witnessing white pride beginning to reemerge and our survival mode kicking in.  It is both cleansing and refreshing and I am starting to feel optimistic.  It is good.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll know the anti-immigration wave has really achieved some influence when reporters like this one are forced to write honestly. There are so many weasel words here it is insulting to the intelligence. </p>
<p>Sarkozy did not &#8220;earn&#8221; any &#8220;rebukes&#8221;. He is involved in a political fight with outside forces. I hope he actually responds to the rebukes by telling the outsiders to shove it instead of just ignoring them.</p>
<p>Those citizen &#8220;fears&#8221; are actually rational desires to preserve national societies. What is called the &#8220;far-right&#8221; is mostly centrist. It is the left that has gone too far. Politicians are not &#8220;playing with fire&#8221; they are responding to public opinion and social problems. Why say &#8220;even&#8221; punish people when punishing is a typical result of breaking the law?</p>

		<p>As much as I admire Geert Wilders, I believe that it&rsquo;s to late to save Europe from islamization. Even if new immigration is stopped immediately &#8220;which is not gonna happen&#8221;, even if welfare  is cut &#8220;not gonna happen&#8221;. Number of  isalmic population is to high already, and they  breed like rats. On the other hand birthrate of White population is declining. Banning <br/>
headscarves and burqas it&rsquo;s not gonna make any difference.</p>

		<p>Dutch MP Geert Wilders appeared at a rally this past Saturday (Sept. 11) in Zoo York City to commemorate the Moslem attacks on the World Trade Center and also to urge Americans to rid themselves of the pernicious influence of Islam (ex: the &#8216;victory mosque&rsquo; being proposed in downtown Manhattan).  I was there.  It was bodies as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/</p>
<p>Two blocks over, those who came out to &#8220;protest hate and racism&#8221; probably numbered no more than 1,500, and the bulk of them were Moslems and members of the loony left.  As usual, the media overstated their numbers and understated ours.</p>

<p>They do not explain WHY those feelings run deep or WHY they should disappear when the economy recovers.  Sounds like the underlying implication is that the survival of European peoples can only be justified if it is economically convenient.</p>

<p>This squealing elitist pretty much gives us the liberal view of these encouraging developments in a nutshell:</p>
<p>1: This is nothing new, so there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.  Nothing to see, folks, just move along.</p>
<p>2: Yet at the same time, it&rsquo;s very dangerous, and politicians who actually follow the will of those they claim to represent are &#8220;playing with fire.&#8221;  (Cue up some &#8220;Leni Riefenstahl&#8221; archive footage of a Nazi party rally, backed by lots of scary music).</p>
<p>3: And anyway,it <i>really</i> has nothing to do with race at all; it&rsquo;s nothing but a temporary manifestation of economic anxiety.  It&rsquo;ll all blow over when the economy improves.  Which will be any day, now.  Soon.  Trust us.  </p>
<p>Leftists are whistling past the graveyard these days, and about time.  Watching them soil their breeches as they see their raceless one-world Brazilian consumer state begin to face its first real opposition is going to be fun.<br/>

		<p>Relentless. The key to success against the Africanization and islamic transformation of Europe.The intruders expect the native inhabitants of Europe to yield,yield. That&rsquo;s been the history of Europe since WWII. Guilt over the Holocaust and colonialism. The collapse of upper class dominance. The supremacy of media fueled by profits by music of Third World and US black types. </p>
<p>But a stiff relentless resistance elicits nothing but harmless &#8220;you are racist&#8221; accusations and some futile mob actions that can be easily smashed by directed force and use of lowtech bio and other weapons the Asians and Arabs still don&rsquo;t wield. And if they do obtain them, curtains for the Muslims, etc, who take up valuable space and drain needed resources from the native residents of Europe. </p>
<p>Will Europe blink? Probably.And it will die as a Christian,humanist(if that&rsquo;s your thing) successful continent. If not, the heirs of the Renaissance and the Roman Empire can flourish for another few centuries. </p>
<p>At least in the Middle Ages however, the invaders weren&rsquo;t living in the hearts of Italy, Spain, France, Germany or Britain.</p>

I agree, though I think the same can be said for the world; not just Europe. The U.S. will follow suit, though it will likely be some years later. Islam is gathering steam now in the first big steps toward such a takeover using the guilt-ridden, indoctrinated liberals that infest our shores.</p>

<p>I think it is an induced crisis being very carefully wag-the-dog brought to subcritical mass so that -the next step- in the socialization of Europe can happen in a fashion that either:</p>
<p>A.  Is unopposed because internal race politics have distracted members and prevented unified action as all gather around the false flag of defending the zeigeist of anti-racism (read power sharing) with those who are hardnosed enough to be a threat.</p>
<p>B.  Becomes it&rsquo;s own excuse for further attacks on nationalism as &#8216;racist&rsquo; when in fact either events go so far as to require EU supranationalist intervention (easy to foresee when you understand how closely intertwined they are with the EADists on this Islamic thing).  Or when things relax and an equally by-design improving economy makes the fear mongers look ludicrous.</p>
<p>This is not designed to be a win folks.  It&rsquo;s a giant psyop operation based around the technique of spiritual disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>Build something up until it seems your only identity vestment option is &#8216;the success&rsquo; of theme/person/rationale X.  And then assassinate X morally if not physically so that the truth of what they represent is seen as a heresy that lets the wind out of the sails of all who associated with them.</p>
<p>The CIA and Britain&rsquo;s Foreign Service used to do this all the time in quelling third world wannabes -before- they could get out of hand.  Now those same skillsets are being turned on their own populations who, never having been victimized by a society built around truth, fail to see a structured lie approaching like a single point of light at the end of the train tunnel.</p>

		<p>The anti-immigration parties springing up all over Europe are not necessarily against all non-White immigration except from Muslim territories and the African continent, mainly.</p>
<p>Such a stance smacks of weakness and half-measures when it comes to what is truly required which is, a halt and complete stop to <b>all</b> non-White immigration not just certain elements of it, followed by the implementation of new laws enforcing mandatory repatriation of illegals and voluntary repatriation of predefined non-illegals.</p>
<p>None as yet are prepared to boldly place themselves in the above camp and openly commit to such a goal which I believe they must.</p>
<p>We must also bear in mind, the European Union which was activated following the end of WWII, was and still is an illegal political entity built on a foundation of Treason, Sedition and Subversion all of which are capital crimes committed by the architects, orchestraters and implementors of this illegal entity.  Capital crimes against sovereign countries and their indigenous peoples, to be precise.</p>
<p>Subsequently as a result, all non-European immigrants currently overrunning ancestral European and British territories regardless of past European colonial involvement in their native non-European homelands are, in reality, illegal aliens and as such have no rights of residence and citizenship in indigenous White homelands at all.</p>
<p>Similar facts and realities most likely also apply to all White homelands outside Europe too. </p>
