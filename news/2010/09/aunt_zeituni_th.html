<h1>Aunt Zeituni: &#8216;The System Took Advantage of Me&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBZ-TV (Boston), September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;If I come as an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen.&#8221; Those are the words from 58-year-old Zeituni Onyango of Kenya in a recent exclusive interview with WBZ-TV.</p>
<p>Onyango is the aunt of President Barack Obama. She lived in the United States illegally for years, receiving public assistance in Boston.</p>
<p>&#8216;I KNEW I OVERSTAYED&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Zeituni, as she has come to be known, first surfaced in the public light in 2008, in the final days of the Presidential election. Then-candidate Obama said that he was not against the possible deportation of his aunt. {snip}</p>
<p>Onyango had violated the law, and she knew it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ASSIGNED PUBLIC HOUSING</p>
<p>Zeituni Onyango said she came to the United States in 2000 and had every intention of leaving. Then, however, she says she got deathly ill and was hospitalized. When she recovered, she said she was broke and couldn&rsquo;t afford to leave.</p>
<p>For two years Onyango said she lived in a homeless shelter, before she was assigned public housing despite thousands of legal residents also awaiting assistance. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t take any advantage of the system. The system took advantage of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t ask for it; they gave it to me. Ask your system. I didn&rsquo;t create it or vote for it. Go and ask your system,&#8221; she said unapologetically.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s right. The system provided her assistance despite her status as an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>ORDERD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY</p>
<p>In 2004 a judge ordered Zeituni Onyango out of the country, but she never left. She stayed, hiding in plain site. In 2005 she attended her nephew&rsquo;s swearing in as the junior Senator of Illinois. In 2008 she was invited to, and traveled to D.C. for President Obama&rsquo;s inauguration.</p>
<p>However her nephew, she says, never pulled any strings for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen. Obama did not know my whereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE&rsquo;</p>
<p>When asked about cutting in line ahead of those who have paid into the system she answered plainly, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t mind. You can take that house. I will be on the street with the homeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>GRANTED ASYLUM</p>
<p>She is still living in South Boston public housing, unemployed, and collecting about $700 a month in disability, she says. And now, Zeituni Onlyango is in this country legally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Did her nephew, the President of the United States influence that immigration judge? &#8220;No influence at all, from nobody, from nowhere,&#8221; Onyango said.</p>

		<p>Of course the old fraud, along with her cosmopolitan nephew, ideally should be residing in Kenya&rsquo;s equivalent of where she now lives (in South Boston? The American Dublin? My God, things have changed since I lived in Boston, a wonderfully &#8220;diverse&#8221; white ethnic mix. This unpleasant old fool is not our problem; tens of millions other illegals, most young and soon to be child bearers, are the real problem. We must cut off their employment and education options, cut off federal and state benefits, and deport the ones who don&rsquo;t get the mssage after the subsidies we provide them cease.</p>

		<p>The $700 is likely pocket money for Aunt Zeituni.  She resides in a Section 8 housing project.  Rent and utilities are based on a percentage of net income.  Since Ms. Onyango has no income, she enjoys free rent and utilities.  Free health care is available at the nearest emergency room.  Quite frankly I&rsquo;m amazed anyone is still living in the Third World given the welfare programs of the Western democracies.        </p>

		<p>Aunt Zeituni is an advertisement for all that is wrong with the immigration and benefits systems in the US. She should have left and shoujld have been deported as the first judge ordered. But she was given benefits and housing even though she was illegally in the US and she sees nothing wrong with her an illegal alien getting benefits and housing that otherwise would should have gone to a citizen. In my opinion no non-citizens should get welfare benefits unless they are legal immigrants, not temporary<br>
workers of any kind, and the reason for the need isnot because of anything they did themselves or anything they failed to do.<br>
The US is not obligated to make her a citizen and she should be deported immediately if the reason she was granted refugee status changes. Anything else is cheating taxpayers and cheating those who came legally. No rewards for illegals.</p>

<p><b>&ldquo;If I come as an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen.&rdquo; </b></p>
<p>In other words, if I sneak into your house as a burglar, you have an obligation to make me a resident and adopt me as a family member.</p>
<p><br>
I have always been amazed at the absence of any sense of logic among blacks. The above is an example of it.  They make no rational connection of facts from A to B and beyond.   This is, I think, a distinguishing characteristic  of &#8220;black thinking&#8221;.  They connect A + B and suddenly they come up with Z, bypassing all logical steps in between. Is it any wonder they believe in juju and voodoo?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;If you have a dollar in your pocket, you owe it to me and it&rsquo;s rightfully mine&#8221;&hellip;. because blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s as if they can add 9 plus 4, and come up with 2,047. And they will insist that it&rsquo;s right and will stand their ground!   They will be quite indignant if you argue. How did they get that result?   Well, only the black mind can rationalize it.  The same mind that believes in witch doctors.  They have their own bizarre &#8220;logic&#8221;.  </p>
<p>But somehow that &#8220;logic&#8221; always works out in their favor, never against. How interesting.  So Aunt Zeituni comes out ahead. She wins and we lose.</p>

		<p>If we abolish birthright citizenship, stop providing social services and education to illegals, profile everywhere (nonwhite + foreign accent  = suspect), take the Oath of Allegiance seriously, crack down on treadonous employers and sanctuary cities, and insist   &mdash;   as a society   &mdash;   that foreigners respect our traditions and country, The US would be far less of a magnet for non-Whites. Terrorism and crime would plummet, we&rsquo;d be governed less despotically and by our own kind, and our media might actually do it&rsquo;s job   &mdash;  - and vet shady characters like those currently infesting the &#8220;White&#8221; house BEFORE they get their hands on the levers of power.

<p>No, Aunt Zeituni.  You never came here as an &#8220;immigrant&#8221;.<br>
You came here as an illegal alien.</p>
<p>This is evidence of the way the media have very effectively scrambled the meaning of words, to the point that by now, everyone who sneaks into the USA is an &#8220;immigrant&#8221; or an &#8220;undocumented worker&#8221;.</p>

But they DO love living in the whiteman&rsquo;s countries, don&rsquo;t they? (Even if they have to put up with all these dratted white people.) Who would ever want to go back to Africa?</p>

Apart from anything else, this shiftless and arrogant Luo tribeswoman has a very peculiar idea of the word &#8220;obligation.&#8221; The US is apparently &#8220;obligated&#8221; not only to let her stay, but also to make her a citizen! <br>
 <br>
But Barry&rsquo;s Luo sperm-donor baby-daddy, Barry Sr., apparently had NO such obligation to stick around and help raise all the various illegitimate and/or abandoned kids he sired, on at least two continents, during his brief, drunken, pointless (and eventually LEG-less) life. </p>
<p>Hey Hussein, maybe it&rsquo;s time for a sequel to your bestselling autobiography. You should write another book (or maybe get Bill Ayers to do it for you) and call it &#8220;Dreams From My Aunt: A Story of Race and Obligation.&#8221; </p>

<p>But how on Earth is it possible for a Kenyan to enter the United States illegally????  It&rsquo;s not like she swam the Atlantic Ocean or infiltrated by submarine.</p>
<p>Every time I go to the airport it&rsquo;s a very real possibility someone will take a look inside my rear end if I simply cut my eye at one of the non-white foreign TSA employees the wrong way, but somehow foreigners are able to steal into this country with the greatest of ease.</p>

		<p>In another MSM version of this story, Auntie Zeituni is quoted as saying that she deserves citizenship because the aunt-nephew relationship is of very high importance in Africa.</p>
<p>If she feels that way, then she should go to a place where she can experience that relationship to the fullest.  That place is Africa.  The only catch is that she would have to take her nephew with her.  Hopefully she&rsquo;ll also take Biden, Pelosi, Reid, Karl Roverrated and a bunch of neo-cons.</p>
<p>BTW, Laura Ingraham said today that she&rsquo;s technically not here illegally anymore, because she got asylum.  (She was here illegally at one point, because she overstayed her legal visa terms.  It&rsquo;s not easy to &#8220;sneak&#8221; into the U.S. from Kenya, for sure.)  She said that it is extremely rare for someone here illegally to get asylum.  So this is at least common sense proof that Obama had something to do with her getting asylum.<br>

		<p>Another sign of the impending doom of a once great country.  And that pretender president is so wealthy that he cannot lift a finger to help his relatives.  And that is relatives, there are five more living large on welfare, all illegals.  My family had a couple of members that were in need of assistance, we all took turns helping, that is our way, the White European way.  These blacks, especially africans, are truly nasty.  They will push you out of the way because, after all, you are a weak white man.  I have seen it all, illegals rewarded in industry with undeserved advancement, rank given in mil service, and high level senior management positions given to them in state government.  In all those instances, never once, did I find any of them appreciative of what they received.  </p>
<p>Many of my fellow classmates and I are thinking the same thing, most of us survived at least one tour in harms way, some multiple deployments to hot AOs.  We think that our last deployment, the one that will be here, in our homeland, will be our last.  Yeah, we are getting on with age, but many of us can still shoot straight.  And ladies and gentlemen, that in the end will be are only option.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Australia is absolutely right. Normally, this case would be a gift from heaven for the opposition. They should pounce on it.</p>
<p>But Obama is not a &#8216;normal&rsquo; politician. The media and the Republicans have been extraordinarly indulgent towards him and they will (once again) give him a pass, just as they did with his birth certificate and so much else. They are all terrified that any criticism of this holy man will be considered &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>And yes, the escapades of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan and What&rsquo;s Her Name Kardashian will continue  getting breathless attention from the media. Meanwhile,  Auntie Zeituni will be forgotten.</p>

I watched it. Arrogance is right.  And I was impressed too with how well dressed she is in some of the scenes shown. She doesn&rsquo;t look poor at all!   How does she manage this as someone who is totally indigent, living in public housing, and has never worked or earned a dime in this country?</p>
