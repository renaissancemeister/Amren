			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A South Side woman shot and wounded a 12-year-old boy Tuesday after weeks of being &#8220;terrorized&#8221; by the child and his friends, who threw bricks at her home, set her garbage can on fire and destroyed her grill.</p>
<p>The woman, who is in her late 60s or early 70s and known as &#8220;Miss Margaret&#8221; by neighbors, returned to her home in the 7600 block of South Coles Avenue Tuesday afternoon to find her windows broken, the Chicago Tribune reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman called police and was putting away her groceries when the boys showed up again, authorities said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman walked out onto the porch and the boys began shouting obscenities and throwing bricks at her, authorities said. The woman then pulled out a gun and opened fire, striking one of the boys in the shoulder, authorities said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbors told NBC Chicago that the boys, the wounded 12-year-old, a 13-year-old friend and some other youths, have been &#8220;terrorizing&#8221; the woman for some time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police told the Tribune that the woman would not be charged, and she was acting in self-defense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that how they portray ALL black criminals? Of course these ghetto thugs were stronger than she was and at the age of 12 they are as dangerous as any 21 year old. We see it all the time. They are not &#8220;kids&#8221; as Whites like to see them as.</p>

<p>Can you say payback is coming?</p>
<p>&#8220;The 12-year-old&rsquo;s grandmother disagreed with neighbors, telling the Tribune her grandson and his friend were just walking by the home when they were shot for no reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>You tell them Granny what a darling little grandchild you have. I&rsquo;ll tell you this much Granny, your darling little grandchild will either be dead of facing murder charges by the time he&rsquo;s 18.</p>

		<p>I remember a case like this from school. Except it was a gym coach who the boys were tormenting. They even called his elderly mother late at night to pontificating  on what a creep her son was. They had also stolen his house keys, wallet and hi top tennis shoes. It was those shoes that brought them down. When the investigation started to close in,one of the boys hid a shoe in his girlfriends locker. They found it and half the student body saw her being dragged from class sobbing by the authorities.  The partner in crime took the other shoe, hid it in his sweat top and snuck to the edge of campus. As an Illinois Central freight train went humming by, he heaved it into an empty boxcar. I think about that shoe and boy whenever I hear a train whistle off in the distance&hellip;</p>

<p>Black folks like bricks. Use of a brick as was used on Reginald Denny [LA riots] is lethal force. This woman was in the right to shoot.</p>
<p>This terrorism had been going on for about a year or so?</p>
<p>In some parts of Philadelphia they call a brick an alley apple. That is a question on the black IQ test ya&rsquo;ll!</p>
<p>This 76th and Coles is right where my cousin used to live. Funny they never used to have that sort of stuff in that neighborhood. I wonder what changed?</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t say what race Miss Margaret is, but I believe she is black. And while I&rsquo;m sorry she was pushed to the point of having to shoot the little thug, and she was right in doing so, I wonder if she would not be charged and found to be acting in self-defense if she were white? Or younger? Or male? Even though I think it should make no difference, that&rsquo;s not always the case, is it? </p>

		<p>Blacks generally tend to mature physically faster then other races. Those 12 and 13 year olds might have been as big and strong as 16 or 17 year old kids from other backgrounds. I hardly think a 70 year old woman is going to risk ruining the remaining, increasingly difficult, years of her life without very strong provocation. She must have been pushed hard&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a crying shame that so many senior citizens are trapped in combat zones that were still good neighborhoods when they paid off their houses years ago.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980&rsquo;s I moved next door to a woman named Trudy in North Minneapolis who had lived in the same house for 40 years. She had an accent that was just like Arnold Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s. She was the most fastidious homeowner that I ever met. She would stand across the street from her house to see if there was anything out of place that a passerby might see. She swept the alley that ran between her house and mine. More than once I saw her shovel all of the gravel from her driveway into a wheelbarrow, wash it, then put it back. She planted, she painted, she pressure-washed and trimmed.</p>
<p>Two years later the North side was instantly overran by Blacks from Detroit and Chicago who relocated to Minneapolis to get in on the welfare boom.</p>
<p>A year after that crack was available on every corner and drive by shootings were a daily occurrence and North Minneapolis was no longer a good place to raise kids.</p>
<p>I moved. Trudy couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think of her every time I read an article like this. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a refugee from Philly. My sister had an apartment on 13th Street between Spruce and Locust sts. Less than two blocks from  where Ptl. Daniel Faulkner was murdered by Wesley Cook AKA Mumiya Abu JaMOOLIE.  The street was tree lined with every tree being surrounded by wrought iron fencing. The tree holes always contained a brick or two. THey were deposited there so that there would be something with which to break into cars. I know because I was a victim of a car break in while visiting her one evening.</p>

		<p>The fact is, bricks can be used as a deadly weapon. If a brick hits you in the head, then  you can be seriously  injured or killed. She had every right to defend herself from such an attack. It would had been all the same difference if this story was about her being hit in the head by a brick and laying in some hospital as a brain dead vegetable. 12 year olds can and do kill. </p>

		<p>Just this week in Atlanta a 92 year old white WWII veteran was attacked and beaten in the head with a rock by two black males; a 14 year old and an 11 year old. The boys came to the man&rsquo;s apartment, asked for money, forced their way in and beat him nearly to death. Both boys were arrested and charged as adults, along with gang affiliation charges.</p>
<p>Likely payback is coming for Ms. Margaret, but I&rsquo;m on her side. If a few more of these hoodlums were blasted early in the confrontation, the more cowardly of them would think twice. Whites and other crime victims MUST start fighting back.</p>

Blacks and other non-whites have become a problem to the exact extent that we have allowed welfare.  They lived for hundreds of years previous to this without being much of a problem.</p>
<p>No welfare = no problem.  It&rsquo;s the Achilles heel of the marxists.</p>

		<p>Current law makes parents civilly liable for the deliberate misconduct of their minor children, and money damages can be awarded.</p>
<p>I wonder if a law making parents CRIMINALLY responsible for the criminal behavior of their minor children would be useful (or even constitutionally viable): 12 year-old Jamal heaves a brick at a retiree, and afterward, Jamal, his crackhead mother and her baby-daddy all face assault charges.<br>

		<p>How did we get the point were so many black teens find it so tempting to bully and menace? It is because our justice system has forgotten what any sane person would know. People learn by example. Never does our justice system inflict upon these predators a worthy punishment that would also prevents others of finding the prospect of imitating their behavior worth the toll.</p>
