			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Gardner, Daily Mail (London), September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman who admitted taking part in savage evictions of white farmers from their homes in Zimbabwe lost her bid for asylum after a High Court judge accused her of &#8216;crimes against humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Justice Ouseley threw out the widowed mother-of-two&rsquo;s appeal to remain in the UK after she confessed to beating up ten people during two land invasions.</p>
<p>The judge said the state-sponsored mob violence, which saw white famers&rsquo; land seized and shared out among President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s cronies, was akin to genocide.</p>
<p>A woman who admitted taking part in savage evictions of white farmers from their homes in Zimbabwe lost her bid for asylum after a judge accused her of &#8216;crimes against humanity&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;We are satisfied that the two farm invasions were crimes against humanity,&rsquo; he said, likening the 39-year-old woman&rsquo;s role to a concentration camp guard who followed Nazi orders during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Mr Justice Ouseley threw out the mother-of-two&rsquo;s appeal to remain in the UK after she confessed to beating up ten people during two land invasions</p>
<p>The woman, who cannot be named, came to Britain illegally in 2002 and did not claim asylum until six years later.</p>
<p>Her bid for refugee status was rejected on the grounds that her own violent actions in Zimbabwe disqualified her from humanitarian protection in this country.</p>
<p>She admitted to being part of a gang of thugs from Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF party who invaded two white-owned farms intent on causing maximum terror and driving away black workers.</p>
<p>The woman, referred to only as &#8216;SK&#8221;, agreed she had beaten up to ten people whilst their homes burned, &#8216;inflicting enough pain to get them to run away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said that on one occasion, she beat a woman so badly she thought she would die.</p>
<p>However, she insisted she had taken part in the raids under duress to prove her loyalty to Mugabe&rsquo;s regime and she had never intended to kill anyone.</p>
<p>Mr Justice Ouseley, sitting at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber said the farm invasions were &#8216;part of widespread, systematic attacks&rsquo; against white farmers and their black workers, carried out with the full knowledge of the regime &#8216;as a deliberate act of policy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The intention behind the &#8216;obviously inhumane&rsquo; invasions &#8216;was to cause great suffering or inflict serious physical or mental injury&rsquo; on victims and cow them into never returning to their homes or opposing the Mugabe regime, he added.</p>
<p>The woman insisted she had taken part in the raids under duress to prove her loyalty to MugabeÂ¿s regime and she had never intended to kill anyone</p>
<p>&#8216;The aim was achieved by the mob violence of beatings administered to men and women, burnings and lootings in a deliberately brutal and terrifying experience.</p>
<p>&#8216;They were undertaken for political reasons, the suppression of perceived opposition and for the financial advancement of the regime members and supporters,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>There was also a &#8216;clear racial element&rsquo; to the attacks, the judge said.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe had 4,500 white commercial farmers and agriculture was the cornerstone of the country&rsquo;s economy before the Mugabe government&rsquo;s controversial land seizures began a decade ago.</p>
<p>Of the 300 farms left, at least 152 of them have reportedly been targetted for eviction with foreign farmers at the top of the list to go.</p>
<p>The Tribunal accepted that the woman was a &#8216;lesser participant&rsquo; in the bloodshed and others were even more brutal.</p>
<p>However, she took &#8216;a voluntary, even if reluctant&rsquo; part.</p>
<p>Even though not a ringleader, the same could be said of concentration camp guards who &#8216;make a substantial contribution to genocide&rsquo; despite their peripheral role, said the judge.<br/>

		<p>This appears to be good news, but I have one question:  Will the woman really be sent back home?  If she is released from custody before she can be deported, it is unlikely that she will ever leave England.</p>

		<p>I had to read this twice to make sure I understood correctly that a court in the UK had taken a stand against blacks terrorizing whites.  I bet that judge won&rsquo;t be around much longer.  That is very much against the grain of the Brit&rsquo;s ruling class ideology it seems.</p>

		<p>Unbelievable, involved in racial violence against whites and the stealing of their land and now looking for whitey to have mercy on her and give her a place in a white society. This disgusting person should be placed immediately on a plane back to her black ruled &#8220;paradise&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight: a black woman terrorized whites in Africa to chase them off their land - and then she illegally entered a white country for asylum.  Justice was not done here.  She should be held and forced to labor in prison until she has paid earned enough to compensate her victims.  Only then should she be sent back to Africa.</p>

		<p>I resigned from amnesty international recently because they refused to explain to me their policy of NEVER!!!! condemning black african thug regimes like SA for genocidal teatment of whites.</p>
<p>A long stream of emails to various AI functionaries went unanswered.</p>
<p>Once we whites have finally regained our identites, dignity, and pride, we will read stories like the above one daily, becaise when non-whites have the chance, they do things to us we would never dream of doing to them, and there should be  stormm of protest over it.</p>
<p>The treatment of whites by non-whites is the big untold story worlswide - of jews and christians in muslim lands, of whites in back africa, etc.</p>
<p>there have been street protests in Europe against the genocide of whites in arab lands: about time.</p>
<p>what both race realists and libes miss is that black and arabs HATE US,  and always will, for the simpe reason that (whatever nonsense we choose to tell about them) they FEEL inferior to us, are painfully aware of missing something we have - the something that enabled us to build up an advanced civilization while they were still trying to figure out basic sanitation. </p>

<p>All too true.  Under the previous Labour government that judge would have been toast.  High level Politicians such as Peter Hain, a convicted criminal, were involved in the anti-apartheid movements in South Africa and the installation of Mugabe, saying:  &#8220;I was delighted when President Mugabe won the elections in 1980&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the tide is turning any time soon with the Conservative/liberal alliance, they&rsquo;re as politically correct as it gets where race is concerned.</p>
<p>This decision is an anomaly.</p>

		<p>Denial of asylum is good, but I find it bizarre that this &#8220;Weltanschaungskrieger&#8221; who helped ethnically cleanse the whites out of her own country decided she wanted to live in a country full of whites, after all.</p>

		<p>What is she doing in a white country, if whites are not welcomed in Africa, blacks must not be welcomed in Europe.  Send them all back, so there is room for all the whites that need to run for their lives.  It should not matter if the black is born in Europe or not.  Blacks don&rsquo;t care if you were born in Africa, they just want you out or they will kill you because you are white.</p>
<p>Finally when there is no white people in Africa, please do not send aid, let them build up their own society, we can just watch and see how they fail.</p>

		<p>She wants to live in the UK for the roughly $2,000 a month you get for being on the dole. Many areas are not particularly white, however. </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve mentioned this previously but it&rsquo;s worth repeating. Years ago, I saw a program on the BBC about how refugees from Zimbabwe were adjusting to life in the United Kingdom. All of the refugees featured on the report were black Africans, not a single white refugee was interviewed. I get the impression that white African refugees are not given any sort of preference by the UK government. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple Change of Duty station in service to the World Socialist movement.<br/>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why any whites would want to live in Europe.  Sooner or later that whole continent is going to look like the Congo as well.  In the recent words of Cardinal Walter Kasper, &#8220;When you arrive at Heathrow you think at times that you&rsquo;ve landed in a third world country.&#8221;  Note that Kasper is not planning to apoligize for having so accurately described the matter.</p>
