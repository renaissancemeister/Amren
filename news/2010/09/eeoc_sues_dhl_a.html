<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued DHL Express (USA) Inc., alleging it discriminated against black Chicago-area employees by giving them worse assignments than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>The EEOC has received more than 20 complaints of discrimination against the U.S. unit of Bonn-based Deutsche Post AG, including the allegation that black drivers were dispatched to predominantly black neighborhoods, and white drivers to white neighborhoods, according to a statement issued by the agency today.</p>
<p>&#8220;DHL assigned more difficult and dangerous work to black employees than white employees,&#8221; violating federal civil rights laws, EEOC regional attorney John Hendrickson said in the statement.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed today in federal court in Chicago, seeks a class-status on behalf of about 150 black DHL workers in the Chicago area, a court order barring the discriminatory practices and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.</p>

		<p>So the EEOC is admitting that making deliveries to African American neighborhoods is the equivalent to combat duty and that African Americans shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with their own kind.  Whites, who have an even poorer chance at surviving in a black neighborhood, should be the ones to be taken out?  Ugh!</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re admitting it&rsquo;s more &#8216;dangerous&rsquo; to be a delivery driver in certain ethnic neighborhoods. Is this news article about &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; or about how &#8216;dangerous&rsquo; blacks are? In either case, whites get harassed and abused while non-whites file the lawsuit, and the reality of the lawsuit translates into &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute!  We hear over and over that black kids learn best from black teachers.  We hear that black neighborhoods should be protected from white people moving in (gentrification).  We see black organizations, hear black radio stations, see hip hop in every kids&rsquo; show and teeny bopper production.  We hear how blacks are victims of white racism and are now a &#8216;protected class.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now these drivers are saying it is dangerous to go into black neighborhoods!  This is crazy!  You would think the black drivers would be happy to stay in the &#8216;hood and avoid those nasty white racist neighborhoods.  What about being a role model for the black gang-bangers on the corner.  &#8220;Look, there&rsquo;s a brotha&rsquo; with a job.  Tru dat!  Let&rsquo;s stop selling drugs and apply!&#8221;</p>
<p>I for one am wary when a black guy comes to the door and says he&rsquo;s a utility meter reader.  It is so tense - on both sides.  Yesterday, a black teenager rang my doorbell and said he was selling something for his school.  I waved him off through the window because it&rsquo;s not worth the 10% chance that he wants to invade my home and kill me and rape my wife.</p>
<p>By forcing a private company to send workers into a neighborhood that will make the housewives and little old ladies scared, the gov&rsquo;t is breaking down another barrier to race infiltration.</p>

		<p>It all depends on what you call &#8220;difficult and dangerous&#8221;.  If you want people to climb towers, get a White guy.  If you want someone to do a complex job up on those towers, definitely get a White guy.  But given the unreasoning hatred so many Blacks have for Whites, sending a White guy to a Black neighborhood is too hazardous, and DHL knows it.</p>

		<p> -including the allegation that black drivers were dispatched to predominantly black neighborhoods, and white drivers to white neighborhoods-</p>
<p>So now we must subject the White drivers to assault or death by putting them in black neighborhoods just to keep everything &#8220;fair&#8221;. Aren&rsquo;t blacks always saying they want &#8220;role models&#8221; for their kids. Wouldn&rsquo;t a black DHL driver be a good role model?</p>
<p>This reminds me of my 28 yrs. working at the Post Office. Mail carriers bid on routes by seniority, the more seniority, the better [ Whiter ] the route you can get. Without fail, blacks would never bid on any routes in the black parts of town but would bid like crazy when a route opened up in a nice White area. Then when they&rsquo;d get these White routes they&rsquo;d complain about all the &#8220;raciss&#8221; White folks they have to put up with [ of course these same &#8220;raciss&#8221; White folks would just shower them with cash and goodies around Christmas though! ] Most of the routes in black areas would receive NO BIDS so they would have to &#8220;assign&#8221; new hire rookies to them. I could write a book on my experiences as a White rookie delivering mail - on foot - in a black neighborhood. &#8220;White boy, what you doin on ma poch.&#8221; On MANY occations I would have to bring some of the route back to the station because of verbal\ physical threats and being spit on. One black supervisor said to me &#8220;we&rsquo;ve had alot of White carriers on that route and none have ever complained about being racially treatened.&#8221; To that I said, &#8220;no you&rsquo;ve just never had one that had the rocks to say something about it.&#8221; The look on her face was priceless.     </p>

		<p>1.  The aggrieved blacks admit a black neighborhood is dangerous? How can that be? Aren&rsquo;t all people equal?</p>
<p>2.  The EEOC, except for IRS and the NSA(which snoops on everyone) is the most dangerous agency in America. While even some Democrats have stopped forcing affirmative action down our throats, this agency never stopped. There is no concern about differences in efficiency, honesty, or skills between races or socio-eonomic groups by this self-perpetuating get Whitey agency. It grew under LBJ, it exploded under Nixon and Ford, and it keeps going and  going. A liberal civil rights activist I know (and yes like) worked for EEOC at a senior level for decades, He said that even Reagan couldn&rsquo;t slow them down, and that&rsquo;s when Clarence Thomas was Chair! I like and admire Justice Thomas, but his political ambitions led to his leading an agency he knows as a constitutional expert has no basis in law or reason.</p>
<p>Abolish EEOC.  Abolish IRS.  Abolish NSA, HHS and CIA.  Abolish the NID.  Abolish the FBI, ATF and the &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221; Division of DOJ. Abolish the Dept of Education.Remove Supreme Court jurisdiction over any case involving the right of an employer to hire whomever he/she wants to hire, or the authority of a school district to determine who attends local schools.</p>

		<p>So, if I or any white person says black neighborhoods are &#8220;dangerous&#8221; that would be construed as &#8220;racist&#8221;. But, that is exactly what this government agency is saying and admitting. And yet they have the gall to sue for &#8220;discrimination&#8221;.</p>

<p>The worst assignments are in areas populated by blacks.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t blacks say that the reason we need &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is because a diverse workforce is better able to understand the needs of minorities? Blacks are only being given the assignments that allow them to showcase the need for diversity.</p>

		<p>The great public pretense of the Liberal establishment that anti-white racist violence doesn&rsquo;t exist.  They themselves won&rsquo;t even walk in these streets much less work there.  The only result of this is that whites will be driven from this job,  which is probably the real goal of this suit.  Another good example of how the so-called &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; campaign is a form of particularly vicious class warfare.  </p>

		<p>This is one reason that there are fewer white taxi drivers than in the past.  The EEOC want to make it so dangerous for white drivers that all drivers will be Black.  The EEOC, like the Obama Justice Department, is not interested in fairness or justice, only in promoting Blacks.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

		<p>The problem with nonsense like this is that it is all very subjective. People will see what they want to see and throw in their own biases and agendas.</p>
<p>So they had more that 20 complaints. Big deal. How many employees do they have? It sounds like a small number. And who is to say that a group of blacks got together and went for the ghetto lottery?</p>
<p>This ultimately backfires, I believe. Companies like DHL, after the usual public groveling and diversity picnics, will let the attention fade away and then simply hire as few blacks as possible in the years ahead. Problem solved.</p>
<p>It really is an ongoing disgrace. Millions out of work and these clowns are not happy driving getting paid to drive around their own neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Back when I was working for a utility company, we used the same policy. Blacks were sent to Black areas and Whites were sent to White areas. I remember once, when a Black employee didn&rsquo;t show up for work and they needed someone to fill in for him in his assigned area. We had to draw straws to decide who would take his place; every White guy refused to go into his area. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;DHL assigned more difficult and dangerous work to black employees than white employee&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I wonder no one considered whether just the act of showing up on time, and doing one&rsquo;s work, was considered by some POC to be &#8216;difficult and dangerous work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every single &#8216;person of color&rsquo; I have EVER observed, (with the exception of one devout Catholic Black woman in an academic setting) from donut saleswoman, to manager in a bank, ALWAYS were a) slower at their job, and b) wasting of time for both customer/client and staff.</p>
<p>When I read that statement up above, I immediately thought of the fact that &#8216;just doing your job promptly and efficiently&rsquo; MAY BE the &#8216;dangerous and difficult&rsquo; element in this spurious suit by the EEOC&hellip;just like all previous suits of a like nature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for that &#8216;content of character&rsquo; MLK talked about, to kick in. So far, it&rsquo;s been forty years, and counting.</p>

		<p>Does DHL pay a strict salary, by the hour or by the package delivered?  Could it be that in areas with high white residency or employment there is more money?</p>
<p>Also, if this system uses seniority as a route selection privilege, what are the relative rankings of the blacks involved?  Do they have a legitimate &#8216;put in my time&rsquo; complaint or are they low man on the totem pole?</p>
<p>There should be more to this than an open admission that certain areas are dangerous and black drivers don&rsquo;t want to be in them because they (the regions) are black.</p>
<p>If the salaries are the the same, it should all pass to seniority.</p>
