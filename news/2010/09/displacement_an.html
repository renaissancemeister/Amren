			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs &mdash; Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Conditions in Mugunga camp for displaced people on the outskirts of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma are tough, but tougher still are those endured by hundreds of people from the Bambuti Pygmy community living just outside the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t plant seeds here,&#8221; said Bambuti chief Mupepa Muhindo, scratching the ground, which is littered with lava from a 2002 volcanic eruption [https://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=29831] . &#8220;It&rsquo;s not possible to cultivate the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bambuti are believed to be among Central Africa&rsquo;s oldest inhabitants. For generations they were nomadic forest-dwellers, living off the land, hunting and gathering.</p>
<p>For Muhindo, life changed in 2004 when he and millions of others fled the war in eastern DRC. Life was hard for all IDPs but even worse for the Bambuti, whose lives are blighted by violence and daily discrimination.</p>
<p>One international specialist described DRC&rsquo;s indigenous people as the most marginalized of all the marginalized people with whom he had worked.</p>
<p>The group quit Mugunga camp, in DRC&rsquo;s North Kivu province, after fights with other residents, which left one dead. Now they live with little if any support from humanitarian agencies. They have no electricity or running water; straw-covered roofs on makeshift shelters provide poor protection from the frequent rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the Pygmies do not receive plastic sheeting or other material assistance, UNCHR, through its partners in UN-Habitat and the government of North Kivu, is advocating for the development of nine hectares of land set aside for them by local authorities,&#8221; the UN Refugee Agency said in an emailed response to questions.</p>
<p>The agency said that around 300 Bambuti families were living in Hewa Bora, the settlement near Mugunga camp.</p>
<p>Lack of services</p>
<p>Hodi Nyiramajambere, an elderly woman, had been living in nearby Virunga National Park  &mdash;  home to rare and endangered animals, including mountain gorillas  &mdash;  which is protected land. &#8220;The government made me move from the park so the government is responsible for my life,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Of particular concern is the lack of access to even basic healthcare. &#8220;The nurses put us out,&#8221; said Nyiramajambere. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t give us medicine, because we have no money. Our children and babies are dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Lattimer, executive director of the London-based Minority Rights Group, says discrimination against Pygmies dates back hundreds of years and is deep and ingrained at all levels of Congolese society.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of their biggest problems is that they have great difficulty accessing any kind of public or social service, partly because they don&rsquo;t have the money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are routinely turned away. Officials or anyone in authority will simply say &#8216;you&rsquo;re a Pygmy, go away&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such attitudes mean parents rarely register new births so total population numbers are unclear. Lattimer estimates there are about 30,000 in North Kivu and 200,000-500,000 in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>War toll</p>
<p>Though they never took up arms, the Bambuti were victimised by almost all the armed groups. Brutal human rights abuses against Pygmies were common, particularly in the northeastern Ituri region in 2004 where MRG documented a campaign of rape, torture, murder and even isolated cases of cannibalism committed by soldiers from Jean-Pierre Bemba&rsquo;s Mouvement de libération du Congo (MLC) and the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie (RCD).</p>
<p>Bemba, DRC&rsquo;s former vice-president, is awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes in the Central African Republic.</p>
<p>MRG says such violence is linked to superstitious beliefs that Pygmies hold supernatural powers and that ailments can be cured by sleeping with Bambuti women, a frequent excuse for rape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt the perpetrators really believe this,&#8221; said Lattimer. &#8220;It&rsquo;s used as a justification. The real problem is just the impunity that surrounds any kind of attack on Pygmy communities and their complete marginalization in Congolese society.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are few programmes to improve their lives, with the attention of local and international aid groups focused elsewhere in DRC, though MRG has programmes to encourage children into school. Up to 90 percent of DRC Pygmies are illiterate, says Lattimer.</p>
<p>Muhindo says he cannot pay the school fees, about US$5 per month, or afford the uniforms. &#8220;Pygmy children don&rsquo;t study,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because we don&rsquo;t have any education, we can&rsquo;t consider ourselves people like others. The Bantu don&rsquo;t consider us people like others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Land issues</p>
<p>Also affecting their future, says Lattimer, is lack of land  &mdash;  a particularly serious problem for IDPs who return home to find the place where they lived for years has been sold off to someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bambutis are effectively refugees in their own country, because they do not have titles to their land,&#8221; said Lattimer. &#8220;In North Kivu in particular land is really the key to development. They have lived in the same place for generations, but they don&rsquo;t have a piece of paper saying they own the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>UN-Habitat is trying to ensure the Bambuti near Mugunga get land titles.</p>
<p>Some have moved to cities like Goma, the North Kivu provincial capital, to try their luck. Michel Nganga Buruki Kisolobo has opened an information centre  &mdash;  an empty wooden building with a guitar and bedroll on the wall  &mdash;  for those struggling to adjust to city life.</p>
<p>Nganga, a herbalist, has been able to support himself in Goma but says other Bambuti often find it difficult as discrimination follows wherever they go. &#8220;Pygmies want to get jobs, but it&rsquo;s not easy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nganga also worries that those who come to Goma could forget the old ways. &#8220;Our children must know about the animals living in the bush,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pygmies&rsquo; lives are &ldquo;blighted by violence and daily discrimination&rdquo; &mdash; from Africans.&#8221;</p>
<p>My advise to them is to move even further into the wilderness and for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t listen to the white fools in this country who will want them to seek refugee status, promising them positions with the NBA.</p>
<p>Leftist dregs are so out of touch I&rsquo;m pretty sure they see nothing wrong with pygmies trying out for the Boston Celtics.  <br>

		<p>A year or two ago I was surfing the news channels and on CNN on the crawler at the bottom of the screen it said that Pygmies in the Congo were being hunted for food or should I say &#8220;as&#8221; food.  </p>
<p>Of course, no one in the MSM talked about it, too busy bashing White racists, you know.  </p>

<p>NOT just for generations. Perhaps for tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>Dispossessed from their ancient ancestral land by the aggressive and expansionist Bantu speaking folks of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>A dispossession that has been going on for millenia and continues.</p>
<p>The Bushmen and the pygmy at one time were the ONLY humans found in southern Africa. They are now very marginalized, almost totally gone.</p>
<p>Bantu speakers - - the warring militias of the regions, KILL and EAT the pygmy, to gain the &#8220;power&#8221; of the pygmy for jungle survival.</p>

		<p>I really hope the story in this article is not used as an excuse to mass migrate the Pygmies into North America &amp; Europe. Even in the area in the article-the danger for them is probably over-hyped, and the potential for safety (for Pygmies) largely ignored. The Far-Leftist Anti-Racist&rsquo;s warm and fuzzy feelings notwithstanding, the Pygmies are not compatible with our Civilization.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more!  I don&rsquo;t care what these Africans do to each other. I only care what they do to White people. Does anyone care about what they are doing to the White South Africans? </p>
<p>Of course we will have these &#8220;Christians&#8221; not to mention our race traitor government, demanding to give them refugee status into our own country. If we do not wake up real soon this country will be lost to Whites forever. We need to out these Christian orgs (with their names) and flood them with phone calls and even protests asking WHY they want to displace Whites in their own homelands!! Don&rsquo;t give a DIME to any of these mainstream churches and choke them where it hurts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confused.  I am the product of a liberal arts undergrad education from way back in the 80&rsquo;s, but  &mdash;  I do remember, I think, the breakdown of IQ, at least as it was taught back then.  100 was &#8220;average,&#8221; meaning that someone with an IQ of 100 could function at a reasonable level  &mdash;  probably basic algebra, but certainly not trig.  Anyhow, if I remember correctly, IQ becomes increasingly difficult to peg when it goes both upward and downward.  I was under the assumption that anything lower than 60 was &#8220;iffy,&#8221; meaning that the person&rsquo;s intelligence was simply too low to gauge accurately.  An average IQ of &#8220;fifty&#8221; is unfathomable to me.  If what I was taught is correct, then you probably have a group of people who may range anywhere from 30 to 50, since you can&rsquo;t gauge stupidity below a certain point.  Please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

What you were taught was essentially the distribution for <i>adult</i> whites, where the Pygmy-like scores represent more than just low IQ.  </p>
<p>A white adult with an IQ of 60 is either congenitally retarded or brain damaged, so there&rsquo;s increased difficulty in testing them.  In other words, they&rsquo;re more than just low-IQ.  Pygmies around 54 are actually normal, so they can be tested reasonably accurately - testers don&rsquo;t need to adjust for myriad developmental delays or sensory damage.  African Bantus test around 70, FYI.  </p>
<p>Child IQs age-adjusted.  A 4th grader with a tested IQ of 100 has <i>actually</i> tested with a <i>much</i> lower numerical IQ (non-age-adjusted).  Accurate non-verbal IQ tests used for white elementary-age students could be used on adult Bantus and Pygmies without age adjustment.  </p>
<p>Extremely high IQs are a different matter to measure, since those individuals are clearly outliers in any population.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still confused, sorry.  I had to do some &#8220;volunteer&#8221; work to get full credit for a course  &mdash;  this was back when &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; handicapped kids was the fad.  Anyhow, I did my work at the &#8220;Washoe Association for Retarded Citizens,&#8221; basically a &#8220;make work&#8221; program for retarded people.  I am not knocking it, nor trying to be rude  &mdash;  it was one of those &#8220;pay by the piece&#8221; places that skirted minimum wage laws, and many of the people who worked there took home less than $10 per week.  It was no sweatshop  &mdash;  basically, you had retarded people doing &#8220;piecework,&#8221; like stuffing envelopes, or assembling goods for mailing, working at their own pace.  Essentially something that would be impossible today in our politically correct climate  &mdash;  &#8220;my god!  they are exploiting retarded people!&#8221;  They worked, got paid, and gained some self esteem in the process.  And the businesses that contracted out did a kind thing, but didn&rsquo;t get hosed financially in the process.  Anyhow, the reason I bring this up, is that part of my stint there involved &#8220;training&#8221; a poor soul named David (I will never forget that poor person) to try to, eventually, stuff envelopes.  His IQ was pegged at 60  &mdash;  but he was one of those iffy ones.  He was confined to a wheelchair, and that poor guy could not even clean himself properly after&hellip;taking care of business.  I am not trying to be in poor taste here  &mdash;  I have the utmost compassion and respect for handicapped people.  But I spent nearly three hours each day trying to teach this guy to pick up a piece of paper and move it to the other side of a desk  &mdash;  for naught, he always forgot the next day.  Is this the level of the pygmies?  God help those poor souls, if so.</p>

		<p>Regarding testing of the IQ of pygmies, I am not sure if it is any easier than for mentally retarded whites. I do not think that the pygmies tested were in an urban environment. Since almost all of them are foragers and illiterate, I wonder how much of this low IQ is because of the environment. Even identical twins growing in such different circumstances will show significant IQ differences.</p>
<p>The best way to factor this variable out is to test adopted pygmy children who were raised under the same conditions as others (including proper schooling). Unfortunately the prospects of this are indeed rare. The chances of a Bantu couple (or for that matter, that of any other race) adopting pygmy children are very slim. So we may never know their true unbiased IQ.</p>

David obviously had developmental delays beyond simple low-IQ.  That&rsquo;s why he was in a wheelchair and couldn&rsquo;t clean himself.  For instance, animals can take care of their own needs with IQs below David&rsquo;s - a really smart dog has an IQ around 43, could be taught to move paper a lot faster than David.  </p>
<p>But, the dog could never learn to speak English because dogs don&rsquo;t have human language centers in their brains.  It sounds like David had &#8216;delays&rsquo; in motor skills and memory, etc.  There&rsquo;s a lot more going on in a brain that just raw computing power - IQ is used for abstract thought, but not much is needed for simple tasks.  </p>
<p>Pygmies are designed for simple lives, and have adequate language and memory centers in their brains.  They&rsquo;re sociable, chatty, athletic and perform all the rote tasks necessary for jungle hunter-gatherers.  But they have very little abstract thought or computation ability.  The average Pygmy doesn&rsquo;t plan for the future or dwell on the past, which probably makes him happier than many of us, but also prevents him from functioning in advanced societies.  </p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read The Bell Curve, I highly recommend it.  The book is nothing like the paranoid liberal press told you, so don&rsquo;t let them scare you off.  It&rsquo;s a great review of mainstream IQ research over the last century and the role of IQ and future-orientation American society.  </p>
