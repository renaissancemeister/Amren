<h1><a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/racial-quotas-so-ordered-or-judge-of-the-day-harold-baer/">Racial Quotas? So Ordered!</a></h1>

	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As reported in the American Lawyer, earlier this week Judge Harold Baer (S.D.N.Y.) issued an unusual order. On Monday, Judge Baer directed two firms serving as lead counsel in a securities class action to &#8220;make every effort&#8221; to staff the case with at least one minority and one woman:<blockquote>ORDERED that Co-Lead Counsel, Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP and Labaton Sucharow LLP, shall make every effort to assign to this matter at least one minority lawyer and one woman lawyer with requisite experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
</blockquote>If federal judges can run school districts and prison systems, law firms should be a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Judge Baer&rsquo;s justification:<blockquote>This proposed class includes thousands of participants, both male and female, arguably from diverse backgrounds, and it is therefore important to all concerned that there is evidence of diversity, in terms of race and gender, in the class counsel I appoint.<br>
</blockquote>Judge Baer&rsquo;s reasoning could apply to pretty much any sizable class action. This case is a securities class action against an apparel company; it doesn&rsquo;t involve racial or gender discrimination claims. (In fact, defendant Gildan Activewear seems quite supportive of racial and gender diversity  &mdash;  check out the Benetton-esque models on their website.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More questions from Krauss:<blockquote>Presumably Judge Baer is not multi-sexual and is perhaps not multi-racial; yet presumably he can nonetheless decide cases impartially. Is Judge Baer making affirmative action a pre-requisite for appearances in his court? Perhaps he has clerks of different races and sexes? If so, is he implying that judges whose chambers are not &#8220;diverse&#8221; are incapable of rendering justice?<br>
</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>Alas, His Honor&rsquo;s ordering of race-driven staffing practices strikes me as, to quote Paris Hilton, &#8220;so not hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>P.S. If companies want to encourage racial or gender diversity by taking law firm demographics into account when hiring outside counsel, as many do, that&rsquo;s their prerogative  &mdash;  and it may very well be a laudable effort to encourage diversity in the legal profession. But a private actor using its pocketbook to create incentives for diversity is quite different from a federal judge ordering firms to staff a particular case with minorities.</p>

						<p>When it comes to diversity in the bar, most of the attention is paid to large law firms. But a New York federal judge appears intent on shining the light on plaintiffs firms.</p>
<p>In an order signed on Monday (pdf), Manhattan U.S. District Court Judge Harold Baer ordered two firms serving as co-lead counsel in a securities class action against Gildan Activewear  &mdash;  Labaton Sucharow and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd  &mdash;  to &#8220;make every effort&#8221; to assign at least one minority and one woman to the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;This proposed class includes thousands of participants, both male and female, arguably from diverse backgrounds, and it is therefore important to all concerned that there is evidence of diversity, in terms of race and gender, in the class counsel I appoint,&#8221; wrote Baer.</p>

		<p>Yep, isn&rsquo;t diversity of OTHER races just great? When will Whites wake up to the fact that they are the ones who are being oppressed? </p>
<p>Who are &#8220;The Young Turks&#8221;??? Notice the videos denouncing Pat B. for his racism are by the Young Turks.  Gee isn&rsquo;t diversity great. Our country is lost due to allowing all these anti-Whites, nonwhite races into our nation. </p>
<p>At least Pat defends what he says.  </p>

		<p>This is a fundamental violation of the right that a plaintiiff/defendant can elect counsel of their choosing, this concept is called natural justice.</p>
<p>For a Judge not to appreciate this is deeply disturbing.</p>
<p>Once this precedent is crushed, there no rule to stop a court (or government) appointing who will and will not represent you.</p>

<p>I wonder if this dork understands that it&rsquo;s his primary job to administer and oversee the law in his court, not concern himself with matters that are not pertinent.  Somebody should break it to him gently that he&rsquo;s not a social engineer but a judge.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s unable to grasp the explanation, he should be supplied with enough coloring books and crayons to keep him busy until his term expires.</p>

		<p>Is the law firm allowed stop working in order to avoid making the effort to hire women and minorities?</p>
<p>Are all the lawyers allowed to quit?</p>
<p>Can they then form a new law firm and still avoid having to carry out that order?</p>

		<p>When are they going to order the latino run companies here in California, which is a latino majority state of 40 million people, to start hiring whites? I can&rsquo;t find a single white in any latino run company and the big retail store chains don&rsquo;t hire you anymore unless you&rsquo;re bilingual. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been around the bigtime law firms in NY,Boston, Chicago, and DC.  They really have plenty of women at this point, indeed most of the law students now at the best law schools are women. So this is ridiculous. A law firm that doesn&rsquo;t staff a big case with women is probably not staffing its cases with its best lawyers, again if it&rsquo;s a big team effort, like this case.</p>
<p>As for minorities, Asians are appearing, more often in patents, a scientific area of law, but they are entering corporate law too.  But for blacks? The top Ivy Leaguers,Stanford, Berkeley and Chicago U grads who are black either stay for a few years and become judges or federal bureaucrats, politicians, or just flunk out because they don&rsquo;t want to work 70-90 hrs per week to make the 200 grand plus an associate with three yrs experience plus can make at a big firm. As for small firms? Except in the criminal or immigration areas, there is no plus for a majority white firm to recruit blacks or Hispanics. Blacks in criminal law like to run their own little fiefdoms, and get plenty of drug and DUI cases.</p>
