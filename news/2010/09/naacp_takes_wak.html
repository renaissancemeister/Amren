<h1>NAACP Takes Wake to Feds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung Hui, Thomas Goldsmith and Mandy Locke, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), September&nbsp;26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Claiming that the resegregation of Wake County public schools has already begun, the state NAACP has launched a far-reaching legal effort to stop the transformation of North Carolina&rsquo;s largest school district.</p>
<p>State and national leaders of the civil rights organization gathered at a downtown church Saturday to announce a federal civil rights complaint accusing the Wake County school system of racial discrimination over student assignment and disciplinary issues.</p>
<p>School board members Ron Margiotta and John Tedesco quickly denounced the legal action as lacking merit and distracting from their efforts to assign students closer to home and to improve academic achievement.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed late Friday, is part of an effort to block the new school board majority from moving forward with assigning students under a neighborhood zone system that would replace a diversity-based plan. Joining the NAACP as parties in the complaint were the youth group N.C. HEAT (Heroes Emerging Among Teens) and Quinton White, a high school senior who was reassigned by the school board this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It [the complaint] claims the Wake school system has violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits groups that receive federal dollars from engaging in discrimination. The Wake school system received nearly $78 million in federal funds last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The federal government rarely declares that groups are violating Title VI, said Wendy Parker, a Wake Forest University School of Law professor and expert on civil rights law. But judging by the national attention the Wake fight has received, Parker said it&rsquo;s likely that officials will investigate and put more of a spotlight on the situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>News and worship</b></p>
<p>Pastors and lawyers spoke passionately Saturday at a gathering at Christian Faith Baptist Church. It was part news conference, part worship service. A multiracial crowd of about 100 people cheered and sprinkled the speeches with echoes of &#8220;amen&#8221; and &#8220;tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben Jealous, the national president and CEO of the NAACP, spoke of the need for Wake County school officials to build upon the successes of the county&rsquo;s diversity policy, not tear it down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Margiotta, chairman of the school board, argued that the system is already broken. He pointed to low test scores and low graduation rates for low-income and minority children under the old assignment policy. He immediately dismissed the civil rights organizations&rsquo; claims as lacking merit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tedesco pointed out that the board is revising the suspension and expulsion policies questioned in the complaint. Those policies were in place when the new board took office in December.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school board is already facing a wide-ranging special review of its policy decisions, including its elimination of the diversity policy, from AdvancED, the Georgia-based organization that accredits Wake&rsquo;s high schools. That review was also generated by a state NAACP complaint.</p>
<p>Now investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Office of Civil Rights may also come to Raleigh in response to the new federal complaint.</p>
<p><b>3 NAACP arguments</b></p>
<p>Officials of the NAACP are basing their complaint on three legal arguments.</p>
<p>The first argument is that the school board approved reassignment changes for this school year that were based on the race of the students and thus &#8220;intentionally discriminatory.&#8221; The NAACP is citing the reassignment of minority students from Garner High School to Southeast Raleigh High School and the movement of mainly white students from Stough Elementary to Lacy Elementary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Capacity, not race</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP&rsquo;s second legal argument focuses on the new community assignment zones being developed to replace the diversity-based system. A school board committee is working on a new model, loosely based on current high school attendance boundaries, that would divide the county into 16 zones.</p>
<p>The complaint contends that the new zones will segregate schools and deny students of color access to educational opportunities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The third argument is that Wake suspends and expels a disproportionately high percentage of black and minority students. The new board majority has acknowledged that the district was suspending too many students and is overhauling the discipline policies.</p>
<p><b>More legal action?</b></p>
<p>The federal complaint culminates months of threats of legal action from the Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. On Saturday, he warned that the state chapter still may file a lawsuit in addition to this federal civil rights complaint.</p>

		<p>I agree with Blacks that the bricks and mortar in the schools in Black neighborhoods are racist.  The bricks and mortar in White sections of town are much less racist. </p>
<p>Also, a Black child simply cannot lean if he or she is near other Black children.  The only way that a Black child can learn is if they get away from other Blacks and become surrounded by White and Asian people.  Apparently, Whites have some sort of ju-ju that rubs off and suddenly and magically makes Blacks smarter.  </p>

Why don&rsquo;t they just admit they believe white people are smarter than blacks and that they know blacks can&rsquo;t achieve anything without the help of whites?</p>
<p>They believe whites are so superior that even being in the  proximity of whites is better than being in the company of other blacks. </p>

		<p>Like problems between non-whites and police, this whole thing could be solved by having black only schools and police districts. Any claims of racism evaporate.</p>

<p>What are the Wake County School Board&rsquo;s odds of receiving impartial justice from an Obama Department of Justice? Not good. </p>
<p>Two veteran lawyers from within the Department of Justice  &mdash;  one a former lawyer for the ACLU and more recently head of the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Voting Rights Section  &mdash;  have both offered sworn testimony before the U. S. Civil Rights Commission that Obama DOJ will not pursue voting rights cases when the victimx are white (for example: the New Black Panther voter intimation at a Philadelphia polling station) and the perpetrator is a minority.</p>
<p>Go to C-SPAN.org and type &#8220;Christopher Coates&#8221; in the search window to watch a few powerful minutes of Coates&rsquo; testimony before the U. S. Civil Rights Commission.  Direct link:<br>
https://tinyurl.com/2dlw7mx</p>
<p>The other veteran DOJ civil rights lawyer, who provided similar testimony to U. S. Civil Rights Commission in April, is Christian Adams.</p>
<p>Both Coates and Adams speak to the Department of Justice&rsquo;s long-standing &ldquo;culture of hostility to the race-neutral enforcement of the nation&rsquo;s civil rights laws.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>What this all boils down to, is the NAACP can&rsquo;t have all black and all white schools. They don&rsquo;t really care about segregation. What scares the hell out of them is when these school DO segregate, and go back to neighborhood schools, there will be nobody to blame all thier failures on, no way to explain the achievement gap and discipline issues among minorties. They have already admitted that thier majority black schools are a failure, because they say minorities will have better &#8220;educational opportunities&#8221; with this diversity based program. So I ask.. whose Civil Rights are being violated here? The white child forced to go to these same schools that blacks don&rsquo;t even want to go to of course. But as per usual, it&rsquo;s all about THEM.</p>

		<p>Total insanity!  We can&rsquo;t have children walking a few blocks to the school near them; heck no.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;better&#8221; to make them get up an hour or two earlier so we can bus them halfway across town.</p>

<p>Under the comment section of the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, a poster with the online name of &#8220;sbdance&#8221; made the following notable response to the third charge in the NAACP&rsquo;s complaint to the Justice Department against Wake County:</p>
<p>&#8220;The third argument is that Wake suspends and expels a disproportionately high percentage of black and minority students&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, a disproportionately high percentage of black and minority students are discipline problems   &mdash;  - many are also hyper-violent. Adhering to the Marxist model of racial conflict, the NAACP demands equal results with no regard for the truth or unpleasant realities.</p>

		<p>Other than disruption of these allegedly integrated schools that are so wonderful, what have the black students accomplished sitting with a few whites?  Do they go to 4 yr colleges, or even community colleges, at the same rate? How many of these intergration-mad blacks eventually go to the silly historical black colleges so they don&rsquo;t have to take hard courses against whites or Asians or Jews or deal with the fairly easy admission requirements of most public universities?</p>
<p>What are their SAT scores, compared with whites, and how many even take SAT&rsquo;s. And what are the suspensions for? Singing &#8220;We Shall Overcome&#8221;? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.I thought the new civil rights mantra was that you had a right to be where everyone looks like you. That used to be called segregation. Outside of this ridiculous county, blacks have little desire to go to school with whites, Asians or with Hispanics. Too much competition. </p>
<p>Ben Jealous really needs to get a life. Ben Embarrasing would be a more appropriate name.</p>

Going to white schools is about getting white tax money, where else is it going to come from.<br>
Then it is about intimidating whitey (or his kids) into submission, getting the white girls pregnant and having mixed breed kids.<br>
Great experiment by the US Government.</p>

		<p>North Carolina &#8220;shockingly&#8221; voted Obama in 2008, (Duh   &mdash;   Obama tried, McCain basically forfeited), with Raleigh and Wake County being the epicenter of NC&rsquo;s Obamamania.  I wonder if they regret that now.</p>

		<p>I wonder if our illustrious supreme court justices who heard Brown vs. Board of Education had any idea the the dispositional and intellectural differences that existed at the time were rooted in 60,000 years of evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>That their magic legal wand that they raised made the gods of genetic disposition laugh in their faces. This will never go away until either we do or they do. </p>

		<p>According to the article, the Wake school system got $78 million in federal funds last year. The solution is therefore obvious   &mdash;   simply refuse the toxic federal loot. Then the NAACP, SPLC, ADL, DOJ, etc. would have no legal standing. Besides, if the school board were to run the numbers they might discover that the cost of complying with all those federal mandates equals or exceeds that $78 million.</p>
<p>The long-term solution, of course, is for the state to repeal all compulsory-attendance laws, which would be the precursor to abolishing public schools altogether.</p>

		<p>As a grade schooler in San Francisco in the &rsquo;60s when Tricky Dickey unleashed the Bussing Bomb on white folks of an unenviable social class, I do recall a few things. The black kids bussed into MY neighborhood were, for the most part, hugely resentful. They liked their neighborhoods and their schools. At that time, no whites I knew of were being shipped off each day to majority black schools. There was a lot of trouble with this arrangement right from the start (&#8216;ya think?) and I only learned of the feelings of the black students after we had done with the fighting and started talking.  </p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s been an accepted fact for some time now that the NAACP wasn&rsquo;t started by &#8220;coloreds&#8221;, and has  never really been controlled by them. Just another &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organization formed by our enemies who&rsquo;s string-pullers use blacks to bash whitey over the head, literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>  Segregation&hellip;.it&rsquo;s only natural. </p>
