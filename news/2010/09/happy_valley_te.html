<h1>Happy Valley Teen Admits Hate Crime Hoax </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Krough, KGW-TV (Portland, Oregon), Sept. 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 16-year-old son of a Happy Valley family was found to be responsible for racial graffiti and threats found at the home earlier this week.</p>
<p>Sang Huynh and his family told police they found a note on their house Monday that told them to leave.  &#8220;Last warning. We will burn your house down if we have to,&#8221; it read. </p>
<p>Along with the note was a book of matches and bottle full of gasoline, said Clackamas County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office spokesman Det. Jim Strovink. The house also appeared to been vandalized with spray-painted racial slurs, he said.</p>
<p>Clackamas County investigators said the boy was &#8220;very remorseful about his conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This 16-year-old did not realize the magnitude of these actions and was surprised at the response to this activity,&#8221; detective Gil Millett said. &#8220;This child was distraught having to change school districts and apprehensive with the prospect of having to make new friends, in a new school environment and that is what generated these unfortunate acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No criminal charges were filed in the case and deputies said the family was taking care of the matter.</p>

<p>NO, he did absolutely realize what he was doing and what the reaction would be. That is what he wanted. HE did KNOW!</p>

<p>Well, since this was all a fabricated (more like calculated) anti-white &ldquo;hate&rdquo; hoax by theses Asians, maybe it should be a trip to an &ldquo;assimilating&rdquo; Melting Wok for an excruciatingly purifying stir-fry for them? Perhaps, then they will not confuse their chopstick sense of Marxist entitlement, with their &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; or some other such nonsense. </p>

		<p>This happened AGAIN?  Every time I turn around some non-white is pulling a hate crime hoax.  Somebody with a LexisNexis account should do a scan to see how many of these hoaxes have been uncovered in the last ten years.  I bet it would make an excellent presentation at a future AmRen conference.</p>

		<p>Here in NJ black and Jewish young people do this periodically.  Even the occassional white person will do it (Susan Smith).  Orientals are just catching on I suppose.</p>

		<p>Any white kid would be hit with a misdemeanor and ordered into therapy and community service.  You all know this is true.  But for a non-white kid, it&rsquo;s excuse after excuse and no consequences.</p>

		<p>Race baiting, set-ups, and instigation, often lead to racism against white Americans by minorities.<br>
The root causes of racism against whites is a mixture of social,economic, and political, forces residing in the complete unconsciousness or denial of America&rsquo;s constitutional<br>
beliefs and the avoidance and lack of knowledge of our constitution by whites to defend them.</p>

<p>C&rsquo;mon. When it is perceived by the media that a non White has been wronged in a racial way, the first thing they do is ASSUME that Whitey is at it again and it is a front page story. Usually for days or weeks at a time.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;No criminal charges were filed in the case and deputies said the family was taking care of the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, imagine that. A non White cretes a racail hoax where Whitey is the assumed perp and when caught, all is dropped. No charges. I wonder if charges would be forthcoming if a White did the same??? </p>
<p>Actually I dont really wonder. </p>

We had another &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; in Buffalo over the summer.</p>
<p>A white woman and here native American husband awoke to find their house, fence, and sidewalk covered in black spray painted swastikas.</p>
<p>There was no follow up to the story but it was clearly a hoax. There were about 20 swastikas everywhere and they were spaced fairly symmetrical and neatly identical. It seemed very unlikely to me that someone would spend that much time painting that many swastikas. A real criminal would have painted 1 and at most 3 (and very crudely) before they ran away in fear of being caught.<br>
 <br>
And as I said, there was no follow up story. What more proof do you need it was a hoax.<br>

		<p>Well, it figures that the Asian kid would be forgiven for his actions.  It is the way things are in this country now.  Just watch the Chris Matthews TV show every now and then, he&rsquo;ll always have someone on from the rag &#8216;Salon&rsquo; or some other leftist organization to explain it all, how the bad white people make these minorites do crazy things.  Why Pat Buchanan continues to appear on this program is beyond me.  </p>

		<p>Were the parents here or their parents Communist sympathizers or members in Indochina? Did they immigrate here under false pretenses that they were political refugees? This stupid (at best) kid may have opened up a rationale to poke into this &#8220;all-American&#8221; family&rsquo;s past and to send them all back to the polluted rice paddy they came from. No, I suppose not. Eric Holder is the Attorney General. </p>

<p>so much for the model minority. happy valley has the highest average family income of any place in oregon. yet this kid is clearly starving for attention. another virginia tech in the works? </p>
<p>one thing about the asians: they do well financially but they have no interest in assimilating. they are very insular and cling to their cultures for generations. i know some who have been here second, third, fourth generation who still take frequent trips back to the &#8216;homeland&rsquo;. </p>
<p>it is wise to keep these people out as well. if you want to know what a city is like overrun by asians, visit sydney or toronto or vancouver. they stick to their own and are quick to discriminate against whites in hiring or renting. i lived in south korea for a while - had a horrific experience working for a korean company that had separate teacher lounges for koreans and &#8216;foreigners&rsquo;. we had separate copy machines - koreans had a new machine and ours was about ten years old. it broke down ten times a day and the management blamed us for making too many copies. one korean &#8216;gyopo&rsquo; teacher sat with the foreign teachers for about a month and then was told she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to sit with foreign teachers. i definitely don&rsquo;t want to see more of these people in oregon. </p>

		<p>* Whenever I see a noose or a swastika I know it is a hate crime hoax.</p>
<p>* It is amazing how quickly non-black minorities learn to play the victim card. I thought blacks had done it to perfection.</p>
<p>*It will be interesting to sell how that mosque fire in Tennessee turns out. I haven&rsquo;t heard too much about it recently.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Jay</p>
<p>Not if the damage was over $500.  It would instantly be a felony in most jurisdictions once the $500 threshold was crossed, with the usual &#8220;hate&#8221; enhancements thrown in, along with probable prosecution as an adult and not a juvenile.</p>
<p>No criminal charges filed at all here, because the perp who wanted to viciously stigmatize every white living in the area is &#8220;remorseful&#8221; and was &#8220;confused&#8221; at the time he did it.  This script is so old most of us can recite it by heart.</p>
