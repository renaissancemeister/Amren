			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pensioner who took his dogs out for a walk returned to find a family had moved into his home.</p>
<p>George Pope, 72, was unable to get into his council house because the locks were changed.</p>
<p>Mr Pope left his home in Barking, Essex, to take his dogs out to nearby Parsloes Park last Thursday, September 16.</p>
<p>The arthritis sufferer, who needs a stick to walk, started feeling ill and decided to stay at a friend&rsquo;s house until he was well enough to go home.</p>
<p>But when he returned to his house on Saturday morning, he was stunned to discover his locks had been changed.</p>
<p>He claims a man then walked up the path to his house and accosted him. </p>
<p>&#8216;I said, &#8220;This is my place&#8221;. But he said, &#8220;This is our property and we intend to stay here unless you go to court&#8221;. It made me feel ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;I have been shaking ever since. I get panic attacks. It&rsquo;s just terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Pope immediately called the council and police.</p>
<p>But he claims they told him the new occupants could not be evicted because they were themselves victims of a scam.</p>
<p>Mr Pope said police claimed the residents, who he believes are from Lithuania, had paid Â£3,000 to a bogus estate agent to rent the property themselves for six months. </p>
<p>The retired Dagenham Ford worker, who was forced to stay with friends, said: &#8216;Police told me it looked like a civil matter.</p>
<p>&#8216;But the squatters were using my home, my gas and my electricity  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s absolutely disgraceful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Pope went back to his house on Monday morning to find all his belongings had been thrown out.</p>
<p>Neighbours then helped him gather up his documents, photographs and clothes.</p>
<p>Mr Pope suspects illegal estate agents of occupying buildings and letting them for money.</p>
<p>&#8216;I had been out for just two-and-a-half days. Someone must have been watching me,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;The rear door had been levered out with screwdrivers  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s how they got in.</p>
<p> &#8216;My neighbours are now too frightened to go out anywhere in case the same happens to them,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>A Met Police spokeswoman said: &#8216;Police are investigating a civil dispute where there may have been fraudulent sub-letting of the premises.</p>
<p>&#8216;Anyone with information concerning the person who has fraudulently advertised this property for rent and subsequently changed the locks should contact Barking and Dagenham Police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Pope, who has lived in the house for four years, was able to move back into his home last night after the family fled but said he is now scared to be there because next door is also being occupied by squatters.</p>
<p>He also claims some of his possessions, including a washing machine and an electric cooker have been taken and that the electricity system has been tampered with.</p>
<p>&#8216;The wiring has been ripped out and there are burn marks,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;The whole experience has been really traumatic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Barking and Dagenham council spokesman said council officers visited the house yesterday and found it to be empty, allowing Mr Pope to move back in.</p>
<p>&#8216;The council&rsquo;s repair service changed the locks and Mr Pope was able to return to his home,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;This was a highly unusual situation and we are working closely with the police to try and determine exactly what happened.</p>
<p>&#8216;By taking quick action we have been able to restore Mr Pope to his home without the need to apply to court for an eviction notice. This would have been a very lengthy process.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are also aware of a housing association property in this street that is also being squatted.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have contacted the housing association concerned and have asked them to try and resolve the situation.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are extremely pleased that Mr Pope is back in his own home.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Just a few thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>1) I could be wrong but I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if those &#8220;Lithuanians&#8221; were not possibly Gypsies. It just doesn&rsquo;t pass the smell test to me.</p>
<p>2) My understanding is that a council house is a government subsidized home and not private property. Is this correct? </p>

		<p>Interesting thing this story brought back to mind. Back when I was young and foolish I had overlapping apartment rentals. In other words I had three months left paid on the one I was moving out of. </p>
<p> So I took my sweet time doing it until the landlord moved all my stuff out and changed the locks. When the cop showed up he couldn`t believe the guy did it. Also, he got my 100.00 soda rack stolen when it went to the curb. He offered me the hundred and I took it and then I went back and I told him I wanted three hundred for it. He gulped and gave me two more and had me sign something. Twenty years on I wish I still had the thing, but I wonder where he got the idea he could pull that&hellip; His reasoning was that I didn`t need the apartment and he cold use the extra three months rent&hellip;</p>

		<p>I just paid three thousand Pounds to a very reputable-looking man who gave me a five-year lease on Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>As soon as the Queen goes to the Country, I&rsquo;m moving in and changing the locks.  </p>
<p>Apparently, that&rsquo;s how it works in England, now.</p>

		<p>I remember in Kosovo, they had -no problems- evicting people who had taken over homes, sometimes just because they were better than their own, when the original owners were forced to leave, at gun point.</p>
<p>If England can&rsquo;t immediately evict and rehouse (&#8216;at government expense&rsquo;) those who usurp it&rsquo;s resident&rsquo;s private property rights, then there truly is no hope left for them.</p>
<p>Occupation based upon illegal entry is NEVER &#8216;a civil matter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Theft, Vandalism and Removal of other&rsquo;s private property is NEVER &#8216;a civil matter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Just because someone from Lithuania claims they have rented a home (papers?  documentation?) from a fraud artist does not mean that the victim of THEIR illegal occupation of said home has to put up with the whole of the criminality!</p>
<p>I hope this pensioner sues his local housing authority, the city, the cops and everyone up to HRM QE2 for every pound they have.<br>

		<p>What a sad story.  I can&rsquo;t believe the slimy council government claimed there was nothing it could do.  Why not go in there with rifles, foce the intruders out, hand-cuff them, and lock &#8216;em up in jail until they can find a new place for them?</p>

		<p>The fact that the &#8220;new tenant&rsquo;s&#8221; first words to the &#8220;old tenant&#8221; were that the old tenant would have to get a court order to throw him out suggests strongly to me that the &#8220;new tenant&#8221; was NOT a victim of the scam, he was in on it from the start.  In fact, there may not have been a &#8220;broker&#8221; involved at all.  The guy probably used his own tools to break in and change the locks.</p>

		<p>This entire story makes my blood boil.</p>
<p>If I were Mr. Pope, after I went to the authorities and they absolutely refused to help, I would have returned to the home, killed all of the people inside who stole it from me, and burned the place to the ground using an accelerant. Then, I would have turned the gun on myself.<br>

		<p>Theres something odd about this squatter story, while it is illegal to evict a squatter without a court order, you can get an emergency court hearing for trespass within three days as opposed to to the normal 6 weeks.</p>
<p>However, if they used force to enter the property, which from teh guys comments they did, ask the police to enter and arrest those inside for criminal damage. Once the place is empty you take back without a court order.</p>
<p>Another point, you CANNOT squat in a property that has the means to support life with in, i.e some food and a kettle the police can and should reenter the place. </p>
<p>So I think theres more to this.</p>

		<p>Britain&rsquo;s previous Labour Party regime operated an &#8216;open borders&rsquo; immigration policy by stealth - foisting the policy on Britain whilst attention was diverted elsewhere.<br>
  Britain suffered from an acute housing shortage before the massive immigration and the situation has only got worse.This desparate scramble for what little accomodation that is available is a direct consequence of Labour Party policy.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take this so nonchalantly like some posters here seem to.  This is getting worse and worse.  Britain leads the way.  They&rsquo;re a country going downhill fast.  Five million public cameras, unchecked immigration, rock-and-rollers from the past who support this craziness, emigrants from the UK here in the U.S. (I&rsquo;ve spoken to a few of them) out of touch with reality and making up all kinds of excuses why they emigrated here to the U.S. - any excuse but the real one - a country whose very soul is lost.  How long is it going to be before the White Race wakes up?</p>

		<p>Enemies of Western Civilization could not beat us with their armies, so they have changed their tactics. Don&rsquo;t fool yourselves, we are at war, and we are losing. Our leaders only concern is greed and retaining their power base, at the expense of the common man/woman. The writing is on the wall, some refuse to read it.</p>

The police aren&rsquo;t stupid or evil, but they are obedient and trying to enforce the law. The problem lies with the lawmakers and those that set the official policies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My suggestion for a solution is to use this &#8220;flaw&#8221; in the law against them.<br>
If they can move into a house, and change the locks, then do the same thing to them.j<br>
Only, you hire some big men to do it in the middle of the night, and tossing the squatters out on their ears, with various bodily injuries.<br>
Then you move back in, switch the locks, and you have no idea what happened during the night, when it apparently wasn&rsquo;t even your house.</p>
