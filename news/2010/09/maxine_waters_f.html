<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/09/maxine_waters_favorite_bank_vi.html">Maxine Waters&rsquo; Favorite Bank Violated Its Pledge to Help the Poor</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Lasky, American Thinker, September 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Boston bank that is at the center of controversy involving Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who intervened with regulators to protect and reward the bank (her husband had a financial interest in the bank), apparently lied about helping poor people, reports the Boston Globe:<blockquote>{snip} [OneUnited&rsquo;s] president pledged to make loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars across Boston, with a special emphasis on low-income borrowers.</p>
<p>OneUnited said it would partner with the city to offer the mortgages to first-time and current homeowners, and provide financial literacy training to residents. {snip}</p>
<p>But no loan program ever emerged  &mdash;  one in a long list of failures by the nation&rsquo;s largest minority-owned bank, which is controlled by Williams and her [Maxine Waters&rsquo;s] husband, Kevin Cohee, the bank&rsquo;s chairman.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote><p>The spin that the bank would help the poor acquire housing and jobs was just that: spin. A few dollars trickled out to help some poor people  &mdash;  but not in Boston, Miami, or Los Angeles, where it opened offices. But large sums did go to wealthy developers in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, executives rewarded themselves with fancy cars and high salaries. The president had run-ins with the law; a sexual assault allegation (dropped) and a drug charge that was dropped after he agreed to counseling. The plight of the poor was a ruse to ransack.</p></p>
<p>{snip} She [Maxine Waters] should be ashamed, instead of defiant. And Congressman Barney Frank {snip} did favors to help her while attempting to keep her role hidden. He should be ashamed of himself, as well (let alone for his role in creating the housing crisis by his drive to promote home ownership among those who could not afford it).<br>

		<p>The rinky dink black owned bank in St. Louis didn&rsquo;t offer subprime affirmative action mortgages.  I&rsquo;m sure that minority-owned banks and certain banks who had &#8220;ins&#8221; with the CBC/CHC all across the country either didn&rsquo;t draw those mortgages or were given exemptions from those CRA mandates.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure the minority owners of OneUnited bank are as aware as we are that poor minority borrowers are a lousy credit risk, so avoided lending to them, knowing that they wouldn&rsquo;t be subject to lawsuits charging &#8220;redlining&#8221; the way a white owned bank would.  Instead they spent the money where it would do the most good, on their own salaries and fancy cars.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so very surprising to find that a bank is in the BANKING BUSNESS?  </p>

		<p>Well, this is little game the leftwing kleptocrats play all the time. They pretend to care about the &#8220;poor&#8221; while slamming the &#8220;rich&#8221; all in the hopes that no one notices how much money they are shoving into their pockets. It&rsquo;s a little class warfare game the Democrat party likes to practice as well.</p>

		<p>This is a prime example of how things are run in Africa = corruption, crime, poverty.  Hollering about racism = cover up to keep milking the system in this case, the whites.  In Africa, blacks milk blacks = hand outs from whites to keep the country afloat.  So in Africa, this type of behavior is considered pretty normal anything different = miracle.  These black folks are no different than drug dealers showing off their gold chains.  Are these blacks going to get away with it in this county?  Probably yes, waters, et al. knows that.  pelosi, franks, clinton et.al will make sure of that.   This is not good example for the younger generation = crime pays. </p>
