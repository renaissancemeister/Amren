			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My-Thuan Tran, Los Angeles Times, September 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez found herself in hot water this week after she said in a Spanish-language interview that &#8220;the Vietnamese&#8221; and Republicans were trying to take control of her seat.</p>
<p>Sanchez, who is up for reelection, was put on the defensive after her main opponent, Assemblyman Van Tran (R-Garden Grove), a Vietnamese American, jumped on the issue and called her statements &#8220;offensive&#8221; and &#8220;divisive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tiff highlights the political dichotomy of central Orange County, where two big voting blocs are Latinos and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>In an interview last week on Univision, a nationally broadcast Spanish-language television network, Sanchez said in Spanish: &#8220;The Vietnamese and the Republicans are  &mdash;  with intensity  &mdash;  trying to take away this seat, this seat for which we have already done so much for our community. [Taking] this seat from us and [giving] it to this Van Tran, who&rsquo;s very anti-immigrant and very anti-Hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her campaign released a statement saying Sanchez was referring to &#8220;those in the Vietnamese community who are supporting her opponent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanchez has worked for years to shore up support from Vietnamese Americans, who make up a sizable portion of her constituents. She attends Vietnamese festivals wearing traditional ao dai tunics and is outspoken about human rights abuses and political freedom in Vietnam, an issue dear to the hearts of Vietnamese Americans in Little Saigon, which has the largest population of Vietnamese in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sanchez is facing her toughest reelection race in years against Tran, the highest-ranking Vietnamese American politician in California and somewhat of a kingmaker in Little Saigon.</p>
<p>Tran said he believes her statements will damage her standing in the Vietnamese community. In an interview, he characterized Sanchez&rsquo;s remarks as a &#8220;racial rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a mischaracterization that there is an alleged wedge between the Vietnamese and Latino community,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tran wrote a letter to Sanchez&rsquo;s office asking for an apology for her comments. &#8220;With such a diverse immigrant population that call central Orange County home, you should know better than stoking the flames of racial division in our community,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 44% of voters in the district are Latino, and 18% are Asian, mostly Vietnamese, according to the California Target Book, a nonpartisan reference work that tracks legislative and congressional races.</p>

		<p>Just shows that donning all that Vietnamese garb by Sanchez is just a charade. When there becomes a threat, the mask gets ripped off and the race-baiter and hustler that this person really is gets revealed. Sanchez is also the person who was married to a white guy and used her married name &#8220;Brixey&#8221; when she ran for office as a Republican. The minute the district became heavily hispanic she changed party&rsquo;s and became a Democrat and went back to using her maiden name &#8220;Sanchez&#8221; to racially pander.</p>

		<p>Loretta Sanchez&rsquo;s problem is that only about one in four Latinos in her district is eligible to vote, and 80% of Latino voters won&rsquo;t bother to turn out. The election will be decided by the R:D split among whites. A unified vote by OC Vietnamese tacked onto Whites(R) will get Tran elected to Congress.</p>

		<p>Ironic that she&rsquo;s complaining about getting squeezed out due to demographics since she orginally got the seat because her district shifted due to an influx of hispanics.</p>
<p>And she wasn&rsquo;t even really hispanic.  Sanchez is her taken name.</p>

		<p>This, of course, was the district of &#8220;B2&#8221; Bob Dornan,  the archetypal pro-immigration Republican, a poster boy for Republican delusion on the immigration disaster.  Sanchez should be applauded for telling the truth, maybe if &#8220;B2&#8221; and his cronies in the Republican party and Conservative establishment had done the same over the last 30 years the Repubs might still hold the seat.  </p>

		<p>Why all the fuss?  East Asians privately make no bones about their views on a racial pecking order.  They place themselves and Caucasians at the top, blacks at the bottom, and Hispanics somewhere in between. And they&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a mischaracterization that there is an alleged wedge between the Vietnamese and Latino community,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><br>
Oh, there&rsquo;s a wedge between them, all right. Other posters are free to quibble with the following numbers, but I believe the latino IQ averages 89 or 90; while Asian IQ is usually pegged around 105-107. So there&rsquo;s a wedge between the two groups of at least 15 points, or one Standard Deviation. That&rsquo;s significant. </p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer to see the OC return to its 1960s status (under Gov. Reagan) as a stronghold of white Republicanism. But that doesn&rsquo;t appear likely to happen, so my support must go to the Vietnamese candidate   &mdash;   who is not only likely to be notably <i>smarter</i> than Senora Sanchez (see above), but who also appears to be running a cleaner, fairer, less race-baiting campaign. </p>

		<p>The Viets are not only the kind of immigrants we want, they are the kind of Americans we need.  Given how badly the US fought for and then abandoned them, it impresses me that the US is their country of choice for escaping the Communist tyranny in their homeland. </p>

		<p>In San Gabriel, California, the Hispanics are accusing the Chinese of racism, because there was an attempt to change the city motto from &#8220;City With a Mission&#8221;, a reference to the San Gabriel Mission established in 17something-or-other.  I wonder how long it will be before they start replacing these Spanish place names altogether. </p>

<p>Please tell me that you&rsquo;re are joking or that I&rsquo;m having a bad dream.  Far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the war ended over 30 years ago and their country is doing better economically.  They should all return.  We don&rsquo;t need any more immigrants, and if we do, they should all be white.  I wonder if people in Vietnam ever feel that they need more white people there&hellip;didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
