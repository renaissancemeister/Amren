<h1>Dreadlocks Not Permitted on Homecoming Court</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Roslyn Anderson, WLBT-TV (Jackson, Mississippi), September&nbsp;21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A week before Vicksburg High School&rsquo;s homecoming festivities several escorts found out that they would not be participating.</p>
<p>Patrick Richardson said he was told by school officials that his hair is keeping him from escorting one of the homecoming maids.</p>
<p>The sixteen-year-old is sad that he won&rsquo;t be in the next Vicksburg High School yearbook, pictured escorting his best friend Sa&rsquo;shia Jones, who was chosen junior class maid.</p>
<p>Patrick said after paying to have a tux fitting last Thursday, the principal called him to the auditorium and told him that he could not be a homecoming escort because he wears dread-locked hair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Patrick has been growing the dreadlocks since last October and said the hairstyle is not prohibited or addressed in any way in the school handbook.</p>
<p>Richardson&rsquo;s mother, Tammi Mason, said she is upset because her son&rsquo;s money was not refunded and that the school is not embracing his cultural expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s actually a form of discrimination to me, because if that&rsquo;s the case, then everybody who&rsquo;s fat shouldn&rsquo;t be able to be in it on the court,&#8221; Mason said. &#8220;They could say anything. Actually, they could say you have to be a Size 10 to be one of the maids.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another Vicksburg High School parent, Lynda Jackson, told WLBT that her son De-Marcus Jackson, a freshman, also wears dreadlocks and was humiliated to find out that his hair will prevent him from escorting the sophomore maid.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually a form of discrimination to me, because if that&rsquo;s the case, then everybody who&rsquo;s fat shouldn&rsquo;t be able to be in it on the court,&rdquo; Mason said. &ldquo;They could say anything.

<p>SIZE TEN!? Leave it to a southern black lady to say something like that.  LIke a school would require you to be a fatty to run for homecoming queen (I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s what a &#8220;maid&#8221; is?).</p>
<p>It really irritates me how some people name their children. Sa&rsquo;shia should be Sasha, Tammi should be Tammy, and De-Marcus should be Marcus.  You are not French, so why is there a &#8220;De&#8221; in your name?</p>
<p>But on a lighter note, I&rsquo;m glad to here this school is standing up to somethign as disgusting as dreadlocks.  They don&rsquo;t let us come to school naked, so why should they be allowed to wear dredlocks? Its almost as disgusting.  I&rsquo;m expectign a civil rights suit over this, however, considering the the fact that dreadlocks are almost exclusively a black fad (the whole &#8220;disparate affect&#8221; thing).</p>

		<p>Interesting this story follows the one about Muslims being allowed to wear beards and turbans at work. Back when blacks were doing killings left and right this would have never flown and the school would have let him dress however he wanted. Nothing like rewarding &#8216;success&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Rastafarians - A half baked &#8216;religion&rsquo; set up by fraudster Marcus Garvey, who just happens to be black. He stated that the next person to crowned in Africa would be a god, enter Haile Selassie.  </p>
<p>So we all have to fall into line with this rubbish or we are evil hate filed racists, despite the &#8216;religion&rsquo; calling for a black dominated world. </p>

		<p>All of the problems which are facing the public schools, and the administration there is worrying about hairstyles. If only the schools would apply the same discipline against gangs, drugs, disrupted classrooms, and violence as they apply against dreadlocks, the public schools might be usable again. </p>

		<p>Well, Patrick shouldn&rsquo;t be too morose. At least his parent,  gave him a real name. Patrick Richardson. His date was to be Sa&rsquo;shia.  In Mississippi. Not the Equatorial Congo or Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Have a nice life, Sa&rsquo;shia. You could do worse by changing your first name to Michelle. But you won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I have no problem with blacks expressing themselves as black. I hope they continue to define themselves so.</p>
<p>It is more of a concern when a person of Asian descent dresses in Western clothing, speaks a Western language, and adopts a Western name like &#8216;Kevin&rsquo; or &#8216;Britney&rsquo;, for example.</p>
<p>The black is doing me a favour by not trying to be white. The Asian is doing everything to put me at ease while he or she  pursues an agenda which trespasses on my racial interests.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with poster #5 (cpascal) on this one.  As a teen and young man during the &rsquo;60s-&rsquo;70s, I was often the object of discrimination because of my shoulder-length hair.  Before I graduated from high school and became a public employee, it had been determined that such discrimination was contrary to the 1st Amendment and Civil Rights laws.</p>
<p>That was some 40 yrs. ago, and to this day I still wear shoulder-length hair (usually in a pony tail) as a badge of non-conformity.  Since those days, my politics have taken a 180 degree turn to the right, but within reason, I still don&rsquo;t believe in persecution by public institutions on the grounds of personal appearance.</p>
<p>Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I believe that private institutions, enterprises, etc., should have every right to discriminate in any way they see fit.  This is where Civil Rights legislation went too far, ran afoul of the Constitution, and needs revision: curtailing the rights of others in order to enhance the rights of a select &#8220;protected class.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also think ANY institution has the right to ban clothing that can be used to conceal the identity of someone engaged in criminal activity, i.e., muslim scarves; afro hoodies; and yes, regretfully, even K hoods.         </p>

		<p>I agree with the school, those dreadlocks are disgusting!  On a lighter note, most assuredly these same dreadlock wearing thugs would raise hades if a student wanted to wave the Southern Cross flag at the homecoming, but this would just be his/her cultural expression.  Yet they better get ready to see that flag all over the 14 southern states VERY soon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that something as petty as a hairstyle should be the reason that a student is banned for participating in homecoming. His hair is an expression of himself, what about his rights. His hair is not causing physical harm to anyone. Hello people we are in AMERICA, it is 2010 not 1910. </p>
