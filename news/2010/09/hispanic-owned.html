<h1><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/09/20/daily30.html">Hispanic-Owned Businesses Rise 40% in Texas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Austin Business Journal, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A total 447,486 Texas businesses reported having Hispanic owners in a recent survey, ranking the state third in the nation for quantity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A majority, or about 56.7 percent, are based in Harris, Bexar, Hidalgo, El Paso and Dallas counties, about 80 percent of which are of Mexican origin. Sales by those businesses increased nearly 47.2 percent during the same period to $62.1 billion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The three Texas counties that reported the largest increase in Hispanic-owned businesses were near Dallas: Denton County rose 93.9 percent, Collin County rose 81.3 percent and Tarrant County rose 67.7 percent.<br/>

		<p>What isn&rsquo;t reported is that the vast, vast majority of these businesses are either taquerias, used tire shops, some sort of auto body/auto repair shop,or a grimy little bodega of some sort. They only exist to cater to other Mexicans &amp; a large part of them are simply fronts for drug activity and money-laundering. Real economic dynamos that will keep our wonderfully diverse nation at the forefront of economic progress. <br/>

&hellip;about 80 percent of which are of Mexican origin. Sales by those businesses increased nearly 47.2 percent during the same period to $62.1 billion.<br/>
&gt;</p>
<p>Which can only raise two questions: How much of Texas business and political voting blocks are in fact dependent on capitalization controlled by Mexico?  And how much of Mexico is owned by the Drug Cartels?</p>
<p>It looks like the perfect opportunity to launder money, keep the borders soft and sell out whites on a burg-by-burg basis of city and county infiltration.  And it&rsquo;s probably already too late to fix that either.</p>
<p>Great Job You Mighty Texicans!</p>

<p>Every racial group but blacks seem to have enough creativity to start up and run their own businesses.</p>
<p>Blacks are always crying about whites, Jews, or Koreans, owning stores in their neighborhoods, as if they&rsquo;ve been denied the same opportunities, but the truth of the matter is that, generally, they&rsquo;re not smart enough to build a community with attendant businesses themselves.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re not whining about that, they&rsquo;re complaining that not enough businesses hire blacks, then out comes old Jesse or Al to extort business positions and money from them, threatening to boycott or picket their establishments.</p>
<p>Any black with any sense at all would be embarassed with such nonsense.  </p>

		<p>Wait. If Mexicans don&rsquo;t start businesses, they are said to be a drain on the economy etc, which is bad, and if they do start businesses, they are narco-imperialists, which is also bad. Hard to win. Good, bad, or indifferent, I&rsquo;ll bet you a doughnut to a dollar  &mdash;  the doughnut is more valuable  &mdash;  that the trend continues in spades. Watch.</p>

		<p>Note to #3:<br/>
Before the 1960&rsquo;s and Affirmative Action, most businesses in black neighborhoods were black owned and operated. I went to school with the children of these black business owners. With Affirmative Action, blacks with the intelligence to run businesses, were pushed into better compensated jobs with little or no responsibility i.e. assistant directory of interregional diversity. Today there are few blacks with the intelligence and motivation to operate small businesses. </p>

		<p>ranger: As Jesse and Al prove, blacks have created successful businesses! Sharpton and Jackson are both black and both have very successful extortion businesses.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, I acknowledge your good humor in this, though I confess I don&rsquo;t see much cause for it.  What you are failing to understand here is that Texas doesn&rsquo;t need to turn into a 3rd world street market of dope peddlers and rat cookers on every corner to remain a rich and vital part of OUR nation.</p>
<p>We survived _before_ the Mexicans.  Texas could even be said to have MADE the United States, -without- Mexicans.</p>
<p>OTOH, if their LMI actions are so useful to anyone&rsquo;s economy, they should, first and foremost be desired by their own.  I have no problems with Mexican&rsquo;s perception of white elitist racism.  I know it&rsquo;s here and I&rsquo;m glad of it.</p>
<p>What I think is cowardly, opportunisitic and exploitative on their part is an abject failure to acknowledge that they are RUNNING FROM &#8216;the good fight&rsquo; in Mexico, the land whose patronage and culture they refuse to let go of, which is run by a 10% pseudo white majority.</p>
<p>Instead trying to drag their misbegotten, failed state, culture up here to the U.S. which is still a 68-75% white majority.  At least &#8216;by the numbers&rsquo; they actually will give us.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t graduate high school in ridiculously high numbers (70% in some areas) yet they -demand- special treatment in terms of free schooling and bilingual education.  They also want on-demand medical care when as many as 50% of their births are out of wedlock and teenaged.  Not satisfied with a million a year on in illegal immigration (just a guess, from the BP estimates of those they -don&rsquo;t- catch, it could easily be double this), they have the highest TFR of any group in the nation at 2.82 to 3.1.  In some States, particularly in the aftermath of criminal rewards, oops, &#8216;Amnesty&rsquo; programs, this TFR spirals up to 4.4 as &#8216;family reunification&rsquo; happens with vigour.  At home, dirt poor, Mexican women can only manage a TFR of 2.4 and many of those will die before 10, just like in any other THIRD WORLD NATION.  Again, if Mexicans are so valuable, why do they let them die off like flies in their own homeland?</p>
<p>If whites are doomed to racial failure and historical fadeout, let us prove it to ourselves.  America will be empty in another century and a half at current white TFRs of around 1.82.  OTOH, if constant burdens of unwanted aliens and massive social welfare is what is really causing our stress-response (note, up to the 1960s we were doing _just fine_ for replacement level birth rates), then it is our misdirected and ultimately traitorous national government&rsquo;s fault for insisting that EVERYONE have an exclusive homeland.</p>
<p>Except us.  Because THE FOREIGN NATIONALS are the ones who drive the psychology that says &#8220;Not safe to have many kids right now&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For better or for worse, God gave US, the whites, a temperate, empty, wondrously beautiful, America.  Crying Indians aside, thus far we have built it up while conserving it&rsquo;s wild emptiness.  Not so the steaming churning hellhole that is Mexico.  Not so the arid orifice of the planet that is SWA and the Middle East where apparently the only sport beyond slaughter is a 400% increase in population, since 1953.</p>
<p>You would think that, when Providence smiled so richly upon us, we would show our gratitude by not throwing it away to every Haysoos, Hussein and Habib.</p>
<p>But no.  The minority among us dictates the suicide of our cultural majority.  The culture which brought so much sanity, technology and legal humaneness to the world.  For no reasonable gain, culturally, ourselves whatsoever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just plain wrong.</p>
