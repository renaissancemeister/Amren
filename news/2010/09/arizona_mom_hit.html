			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, Sept. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arizona mother is suffering from severe burns to her face and chest after another woman allegedly threw a powerful acid at her face, MyFoxPhoenix.com reports.</p>
<p>Authorities said Derri Velarde of Mesa, Ariz., was getting out of her car at an apartment complex on Friday when a female suspect approached her and threw acid in her face, according to the station.</p>
<p>Investigators reportedly believe the incident was not a random attack and say the suspect hid behind Velarde&rsquo;s vehicle, waiting for the 41-year-old to get out of work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what could go through a person&rsquo;s head to do something like that,&#8221; David Dias, the victim&rsquo;s son, told KPHO.com. &#8220;I mean if it was jealousy or trying to hurt someone&rsquo;s appearance like that, it&rsquo;s disgusting and wrong and there&rsquo;s a special place in hell for people like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw her for the first time, when she was being wheeled out of the room, I saw the burn marks and the scars. and at first she was happy to see us. Then you could see she broke down, and it&rsquo;s tough to see your mom like that,&#8221; Dias told the website.</p>
<p>Police are searching for the suspect, described as 30 to 40 year-old Hispanic female, 5&rsquo;6&#8221; and weighing 140 pounds. The suspect is believed to have black shoulder-length hair, authorities said, and was reportedly wearing a black tank top and black sweat pants with a white stripe at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>The assault on Velarde comes just days after 28-year-old Bethany Storro was attacked in Vancouver, Wash., with an acid that disintegrated her clothing and left her with severe burns to her face and chest.</p>

		<p>Well, this appears to be a grudge attack between two female Hispanics of the same age and race.   So it wasn&rsquo;t a racial attack.  Also, as stated, the perp hid and waited for her, so it wasn&rsquo;t a random attack either.  I suspect when the story comes out there&rsquo;s going to be more to this - jealousy over a man, a job,  or something such.</p>

		<p>When I first heard of this, the report was that a black female was the perp.  I wish they&rsquo;ed get their stories right.</p>

		<p>This type of attack is particularly vile and I heard nothing about it in the mainstream media.  Sharia law might be useful against the perps where they get the same treatment.  I suspect that would stop this quickly.</p>

		<p>Back when I was a kid &amp; knew nothing about blacks, a newspaper item burned itself into my brain.  A black couple&rsquo;s argument had escalated to where the wife boiled a pot of water &amp; poured syrup in it, then threw the concoction into her husband&rsquo;s face.  Burning &amp; sticky both   &mdash;   &amp; quite deliberate.  I think in the back of my mind now that&rsquo;s something I associate with them, although surely other people do things equally horrific to each other.</p>

		<p>The attacker acted in no less a manner than a savage removing the heart from their sacrifical victim.<br>
Let Americans raise awareness toward this issue now so that the next white American be prepared.</p>

		<p>This is usually a Pakistani muslim thing done to non muslims, I bet the attacker was in fact black and muslim.</p>

		<p>The attack in Vancouver made me wonder if it wasn&rsquo;t somehow connected - at least philosophically - to the shootings of the 5 police officers in the restaurant by the black extremist.  I think Washington State might have some sort of problem with this black militancy stuff.  It&rsquo;s a very liberal state and I also have learned that it is sort of a mecca for black radicals of various shades and flavors.  Something to think about.</p>

As American&rsquo;s we must shed awareness and be prepared to point out violent persecutions when the mass media fails to provide it for us.<br>
Due in light of the ever emerging fact that white Americans are not being given the respect earned by the accomplishements of our people, our current situation must<br>
motivate us as Americans to become our own media bosses.<br>
We must make our voices heard across the internet and through<br>
the streets of Washinton D.C. to remind ourselves that government serves the people and the people are governed by a higher authority.<br>
Acid attacks should not happen here in America no matter the race of the victim or the inexcusable motives behind them.</p>
