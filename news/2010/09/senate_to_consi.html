<h1>Senate to Consider DREAM Act Immigration Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ABC News, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced today that he will offer the controversial DREAM Act as an amendment to a major defense bill expected to receive a Senate vote next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;This amendment will ensure that millions of children who grow up as Americans will be able to get the education they need to contribute to our economy,&#8221; Reid in a statement.</p>
<p>The DREAM Act, which has some bipartisan support, would allow young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. before age 16, and have been here for at least five years, to earn legal status if they pass background checks, attend college or serve in the military for at least two years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Richard Lugar has been a sponsor of the DREAM Act, but many Republicans see the bill as an &#8220;amnesty&#8221; and are wary of touching it in a hotly contested election year. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell today called Reid&rsquo;s move &#8220;needlessly controversial.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the White House has indicated, as recently as yesterday, that it would support DREAM legislation.</p>

		<p>This is not a surprise.  A few months ago, the Democrats said they would try to pass full or close to full amnesty by way of salami slicing, i.e. chopping the whole &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; bill into slices, and putting one piece at a time into bigger pieces of legislation that are expected to pass.</p>
<p>Sharron Angle better make an issue of this Reid trick in one of her upcoming ads.</p>

		<p>Many colleges just go ahead and admit illegals anyway and give them scholarships, to the detriment of US citizens, without a federal program. Harvard recently made a big deal out of protecting an illegal who was brought over here by his illegal parents, When ICE tried to deport him, all the powerful Harvard elite types pulled stings with chum Obama. The kid is staying, and there are thousands like him. The Nightmare Act would just compound the problem.</p>
<p>I have a DREAM too. That real American kids can get federal scholarships without having their heritage stolen from them by illegal immigrants and their kids.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Mr. Reid pays attention to much, but the economy is slowly but steadily shrinking, whether or not transnational corporations are having record profits.</p>
<p>The United States does not need 300 million people with a college degree. It also is not in need of Indian, Asian, and Mexican immigrants. What it needs are politicians who are willing to stand up to unfair trade policies that makes the private sector American worker dependent on federal handouts. If the jackasses and the fatasses (Dems and Repugs) keep listening to their &#8220;economic experts&#8221; we will soon resemble a nation like Mexico. 60% peasant, 20% small business/merchant, 10% government/corporate oligarchs. </p>
<p>If financial sector and other Wall Street workers start boarding their families on planes for Macau and Singapore en mass, my suggestion would be immediate arrest and confiscation of all their remaining property.</p>
<p>The &#8220;free market&#8221; has it&rsquo;s limits, definitely when it comes to selling out a nation.</p>

		<p>Where I live, you hardly ever see a white college kid, and I live near and pass by three colleges near my house.  (I attended one of them for about 7 years and recently graduated.  The only white people were almost all the professors and a few students in upper division Masters classes).</p>
<p>I wondered about that sometimes, never really seeing any other whites while walking through the sprawling campus.  Jews (the very middle eastern types), orientals, indo-paks and misc. latinos were basically what you saw.</p>
<p>Where I work they really push the dream act with great fervor, as most of the people there are illegals or supporters of illegals.  I will support the dream act only when other countries agree to give free tuition and citizenship to illegal alien youth that enter their borders.  </p>
<p>How come only white nations are expected to do this but the non-white world can practice as much &#8216;injustice&rsquo; and &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; as they like to outsiders?</p>

		<p>Both parties, politicans in general, need replacement.  If you can name your representative  then they need to go.  We have for years elected lawyers assuming them to be &#8220;best and brightest&#8221;, now wrong we have been.</p>
<p>The time has come to elect the village idiot or better yet the common everyday tax paying working person, after all the smart people have ruined this country&hellip;maybe the common everyday working person who loves this country can fix it.  They couldn&rsquo;t do worse.</p>
