<h1>Chuck Turner: Probe &#8216;Riddled With Racism&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurel J. Sweet, Boston Herald, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With less than three weeks until his federal corruption trial starts, City Councilor Chuck Turner claims in newly filed court documents he&rsquo;s the victim of a government probe &#8220;riddled with racism&#8221; and wants to avoid jurors bringing their baggage of biases to the table.</p>
<p>Turner&rsquo;s lawyers are seeking U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock&rsquo;s OK to pepper prospective jurors with a dozen prejudice-specific questions, including:</p>
<p>* &#8220;Do you believe that people of color are more likely to commit crimes than whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;Would you believe the testimony of a white person over that of a black person simply because of the color of their skin?&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;If people of color moved into your neighborhood, would you be more afraid of crime than you are now?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important to ferret out any potential bias a juror might have in order to have a fair trial. You need to ask questions that are going to get you honest responses from jurors,&#8221; he [Hub attorney William Korman] said.</p>
<p>In his six-page pretrial memorandum filed Tuesday, Turner, 70, put Woodlock on notice he intends &#8220;to show that the investigation in this case was riddled with racism and discriminatory conduct on the part of the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Turner, who goes on trial Oct. 12, is charged with attempted extortion and making false statements for allegedly pocketing a $1,000 bribe from a government informant who sought his help obtaining a liquor license for a nightclub. {snip}</p>

		<p>If having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer to those three questions that Turner&rsquo;s lawyers will ask prospective jurors will disqualify someone from serving on that jury, then Jesse Jackson wouldn&rsquo;t be able to serve on that jury.  After all, he would answer yes to the first and third question.</p>

		<p>Everything is racist. Much of the black community feels under attack ( White Might, Black Fright article anyone?) and sees anything as an attack. Now, there is real racism towards blacks, just as there is real racism towards whites, but the black community claims everything is &ldquo;racist&rdquo; and it has gotten to a point where they have screamed racism so much, that now you can&rsquo;t even take them seriously, they are like the boy that cried wolf. </p>
<p>* &ldquo;Do you believe that people of color are more likely to commit crimes than whites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe? We know they do, just look at crime records. Perhaps facts are racist as well? </p>
<p>* &ldquo;Would you believe the testimony of a white person over that of a black person simply because of the color of their skin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, because a white person can lie just as well as a black person. It all depends on the individual in court. </p>
<p>* &ldquo;If people of color moved into your neighborhood, would you be more afraid of crime than you are now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it is like %90 of cases where black families moved in than yes I would. I choose to live with my people.  </p>
<p>All of these questions have nothing to do with the case and they are all about race, so my question is who really is racist here? <br>

		<p>That tired old excuse? Please stop with the dread &#8220;R&#8221; word. You are nervous that the truth will come out and think white people will run from it like a vampire from sunlight&hellip;.*yawn*.</p>

Since I would not only answer yes to the three questions but included sources to back up my facts, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d be selected for jury duty.</p>

		<p>Today, I notice that the dangerous looking pedestrians in my neighborhood were all blacks, ergo, I&rsquo;m riddled with racism.  My acknowledgement of my sin does nothing to make the blacks less dangerous, ergo, I will re-embrace my racism and live longer.</p>
<p>Integration is Hell.  May MLK and LBJ receive the greatest damnation of all.<br>

		<p>Are they going to ask Black jurors and Mexican jurors the same questions? We all know they always tell the truth when it comes to race. (sarcasm)</p>
<p>If a White answers yes to those questions will that person be on a &#8220;list&#8221; somewhere? We all know that the answer to that one, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>As a former long-time Bostonian,let me defend Turner. White like the Kennedys and McCormicks ripped off the public treasury and abused power for decades. Aren&rsquo;t we for racial equality. Criticize the black man for apathy, sloth, excessive physical violence and sexual terror. Criticize him for ignorance of Western culture. For indifference to great orchestral music,opera, or classical paintings. But for God&rsquo;s sakes man, do not say that the descendents of slaves have lower public ethics than the Irish, Italian or Jewish immigrants who ran Boston from the late 19th century to the end of the &#8216;80&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>All of these groups together with today&rsquo;s Bostonian Blacks, have managed to flush the great heritage of the Puritans, the Revolutionary War generation and even the wacky but highly intelligent and basically honest Transcendentalists down the ancient, rat-filled sewers of Boston.</p>

<p>Note that the question has nothing to do with facts. They want to know what you &#8220;believe&#8221;. I would suggest someone believing something contrary to the facts would indicate bias. Though I don&rsquo;t suppose that&rsquo;s the way the question will be graded.</p>

		<p>Here it goes again. More lawyers for another black man playing the race card, with their defendant trying to hide behind his race. </p>
<p>How unique and novel. Pretending to ferret out the racists, which, by black people and the white libtards definition, can only be white.</p>
<p>If I was the one being questioned, at the end of the questioning I would ask the attorney what his defendant&rsquo;s race had to do  with the crime he&rsquo;s being charged with? And would he ask these same questions if his defendant was white? And, before they could drag me out, I&rsquo;d say &#8220;Sir, YOU are the racist!&#8221;</p>

<p>The correct answer to the question is not subjective or a matter of belief but simple objective fact.</p>
<p>Blacks by percentage commit more crimes, period.</p>
<p>To &#8220;believe&#8221; otherwise is to take leave of reality.</p>

		<p>Well, it looks like this is one more way for people to avoid jury duty&hellip;</p>
<p><i>White like the Kennedys and McCormicks ripped off the public treasury and abused power for decades.</i></p>
<p>Indeed. And let us not forget, also promoted open borders and forced busing while living in their own protected enclaves. </p>
