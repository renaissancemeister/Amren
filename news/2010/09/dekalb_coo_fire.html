<h1>DeKalb COO Fired Amid Charges of Improper Relationship With Subordinate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Matteucci, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>DeKalb County&rsquo;s CEO fired his second in command Thursday after learning that the official had had an improper relationship with a water department secretary.</p>
<p>As part of his termination, Chief Operating Officer Keith Barker will be paid $100,000  &mdash;  half of his annual salary  &mdash;  making him the second member of CEO Burrell Ellis&rsquo; Cabinet to leave within weeks with a sizable severance package.</p>
<p>Based on a tip, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained e-mails, text messages, photographs, cards and phone records documenting his nine-month relationship with Dana TraBue, an administrative assistant in the Watershed Management Department. Following this and other media inquiries, Barker was terminated.</p>
<p>TraBue, who spoke exclusively with the AJC, said Barker had discussed promoting her to a higher-paid position.</p>
<p>&#8220;He promised me a better-paying job,&#8221; TraBue said. &#8220;He kept saying we need to wait for the budget [to be approved].&#8221;</p>
<p>TraBue said the relationship was consensual and she has not filed any complaints to the county. She said she broke off the relationship &#8220;because I&rsquo;m tired of him lying to me and it&rsquo;s a dead-end situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barker&rsquo;s dismissal closely follows the departure of the county&rsquo;s chief communications officer, Sheila Edwards, who received $45,000 in severance pay in July when she resigned amid controversy over statements she made about a police-involved shooting.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the four-year contract Barker signed in January 2009 for an annual salary of $200,000, he will receive six months of salary and benefits as a result of the termination. According to the contract, which the AJC obtained, the only way he would lose that severance would be if he resigned or was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barker, who is married, and TraBue, who is single, exchanged several messages, including as recently as last month, talking about which jobs he could get for her, including one in human resources and one as a buyer&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>County commissioners chastised Barker last week about the advertising of several positions at the performing arts center without the commission&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>One of those jobs was supposed to be for TraBue, she said.</p>
<p>She said Barker would meet her when he was supposed to be at budget meetings, and that they also got together at her house &#8220;on county time and when he should have been working.&#8221;</p>
<p>TraBue said their relationship started in December when she saw Barker at a county meeting and sent him a friend request on Facebook. He subsequently began sending her e-mails and text messages from his county and personal cell phones, along with Facebook messages.</p>
<p>County cell phone records obtained by the AJC show Barker sent 13 messages from his county phone to TraBue over a three-day period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CEO said he had not conducted any investigations but decided to terminate Barker because of his own admissions and information from the media. Ellis said Barker previously had a good record at work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to Barker and Edwards, DeKalb County has also seen a large severance package given to school Superintendent Crawford Lewis. Lewis, who did not fall under Ellis&rsquo; supervision, was dismissed by the county school board in April and received an $85,000 payout and an additional $5,000 for a retirement account. Lewis has since been indicted on charges that he ran a criminal enterprise at the school system.</p>

<p>Darn!</p>
<p>And he was all set to take his high school GED for the third time, hoping to pass this time, so he could get a salary increase to $300,000.</p>
<p>When he won&rsquo;t be able to find a job in the private sector  paying anymore than a few thousand he&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s because of white oppression and racism.</p>
<p>Black men are treated outrageously in this society just like Jeremiah says.</p>

		<p>There are some nice neighborhoods in DeKalb, but I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for those Whites one bit.  They know they live in a black ruled county that is progressing steadily toward its inevitable and God promised third world status.</p>
<p>City of Atlanta is hardly better.  Drive down any street of any nice White subdivision in Atlanta, and start counting the for sale signs, especially in Buckhead where the really rich Whiteys live.   </p>
<p>People are fleeing Atlanta&rsquo;s taxes and black rule. But too late- bad time to sell a house.  Equity is vanishing.</p>
<p>You can have growth, prosperity, and performing real estate investments, or you can have Diversity, but you can&rsquo;t and never will have both.</p>
<p>Transcend Them All. Flee!!!</p>

		<p>Looking at Mr. Barker&rsquo;s picture (let&rsquo;s be honest here&hellip;that IS one fine-looking man&hellip;for a black, and a non-bodybuilder), I have to wonder whether he owes his own position to some sort of &#8220;improper relationship&#8221;.  After all, his recent behavior strongly suggests that he was not chosen for the $200,000.00 position because he possessed outstanding character traits or superior intellect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if the &#8216;down-low&rsquo; thing were not rampant among the &#8216;Black Elite&rsquo;.  Here in the Jackson Metro, there is a continuous supply of scandals and rumors about powerful black men sexually &#8216;imposing upon&rsquo;, or downright raping, other black men (and boys) over whom they have some sort of authority.</p>
<p>Posters who seem obsessed with what will happen if blacks get the upper hand and come for &#8216;our women&rsquo;, need also to worry about their own personal bodies, because, as Antoine Dodson so eloquently puts it,(my translation from Ebonics) &#8220;&hellip;and hide your husbands, because they&rsquo;re raping everybody, out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over history, the most blatant womanizers have tended to also have discrete dalliances with men.  Maybe they go after women in such a flashy and careless way, because they want to prove they&rsquo;re &#8220;really men&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that these observations are relevant or applicable to Barker&rsquo;s situation or mindset, or are in any way germane to this article.  Just wondering&hellip;</p>

		<p>Please understand the the DeKalb County school budget is completely separate from the DeKalb County Government budget.  Crawford Lewis has recieved NO DeKalb County Government funds!  The school system is not a DeKalb County Government entity.</p>

		<p>There are certain women that go after married men.  The men are to stupid to see through this.  I believe that these men have to prove  something to themselves.  The other woman is going to lie and tell them what they need to hear, the wife is going to tell the truth.  I work with a man that has 2 other women on the campus, a student and a staff member, he is very stupid too because if the student finds out about the staff member all hell is going to break loose..  This man is in his 60&rsquo;s with all kinds of health issues, what is he giving them besides some gas money&hellip;.  </p>
