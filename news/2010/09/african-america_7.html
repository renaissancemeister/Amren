<h1><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20100928/African-Americans-less-likely-to-ban-smoking-at-home.aspx">African-Americans Less Likely to Ban Smoking at Home</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Medical News, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;African-American homes have fewer full bans, and more people are allowed to smoke in those homes,&#8221; said Jessica Muilenburg, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the department of health promotion and behavior at the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>The study appears in the August issue of the journal Health Education &amp; Behavior.</p>
<p>{snip} About three quarters of the teens surveyed were African-American; nearly one quarter were white.</p>
<p>Sixty-one percent of teens reported having smoking bans at home that disallowed any smoking; 32 percent of teens noted they were not allowed to smoke at home although adults were; and 7 percent of teens reported no restrictions on smoking at home. {snip}</p>
<p>Overall, about 66 percent of white parents banned smoking at home completely, compared with 60 percent of African American parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;More people are allowed to smoke in those homes and, although it didn&rsquo;t seem to translate into behavior, it did look like quitting and the attempts to quit smoking were not as high as in our white sample. So ultimately, even though they wanted to quit as much as whites, black teens were less likely to make an attempt,&#8221; Muilenburg said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although African-American homes might be less likely to ban smoking at home, Unger said that African-American adolescents in general are much less likely to smoke than white teens, a finding supported by this study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some studies have shown that African-American parents impose stricter discipline on their children and make more absolute rules about substance use, whereas white parents are more likely to allow their children to experiment with smoking and make their own decisions,&#8221; Unger said. {snip}</p>

		<p>One thing about this story   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re assuming that the blacks just knew that when the topic was smoking, the object of interest was tobacco cigarettes.  I think some of them might have actually thought the survey was asking about weed.</p>

<p>Are we still suppose to buy into all this propaganda that &#8220;blacks are &#8220;better&#8221; than White parents&#8221;? Blacks have STRICTER discipline and more absolute rules about substance abuse????? Where do these so-called lying &#8220;experts&#8221; come from?  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with black teens for years and almost ALL of them smoke marijuana (and so do their parents and grandparents). I really don&rsquo;t know where this study is coming from&hellip;</p>

		<p>3/4 people surveyed were black and only 1/4 were white? What? Then re-read the last paragraph also. You gotta be kidding me! Good God. How dumb must one be to buy &#8216;Dr.&rsquo; Muisenberg&rsquo;s Bolshevik tripe? I&rsquo;m SO damn sick of them, I swear</p>

		<p>Gotta agree with the other posters. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense that black parents have a more lax attitude towards smoking in the house, and yet black teens are LESS likely to smoke cigarettes&hellip;unless they&rsquo;re smoking something else. </p>
<p>And as far as  black parents being stricter disciplinarians than white parents, then how do these &#8220;experts&#8221; explain rampant crime in the black &#8220;community&#8221; among black teens?</p>

		<p>I would strongly question the methodology used in this &#8220;survey&#8221;.</p>
