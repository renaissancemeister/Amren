<h1>Detroit Sees Rise in White Residents After 60 Years</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Wisely, Detroit Free Press, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After six decades of white flight, the percentage of white Detroiters has shot up dramatically, according to a new census survey released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The survey, more estimate than precise numbers, shows that the percentage of white, non-Hispanic Detroiters rose from 8.4% of the city&rsquo;s population in 2008 to 13.3% last year.</p>
<p>Much of the rise can be pegged to younger white people  &mdash;  along with some empty nesters  &mdash;  moving to the city, even as African Americans continue to leave for the suburbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&rsquo;re seeing is a move back to the city by a younger population that sees the city as cool,&#8221; said Kurt Metzger, director of Data Driven Detroit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Declines in many areas</b></p>
<p>The changes dropped Michigan from 31st to 35th among states in income, falling below neighbors Ohio and Indiana, where income also fell, though not as quickly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Help with food</b></p>
<p>The number of Michigan households that received food stamps or other food assistance rose to 14.5% in 2009. Hunger is showing itself even in affluent suburbs, said Gerry Brisson of Gleaners Food Bank, which supplies food pantries and soup kitchens across metro Detroit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The census survey also estimated demographic changes in addition to economic indicators. The data show a growing diversity in metro Detroit.</p>
<p>The data show that black people continued to move from Detroit to Macomb County, where the black population rose from 7.2% of in 2008 to 8% in 2009. The black population of Oakland County grew slightly, from 12.1% to 12.4%. The white population of Detroit increased from 8.4% in 2008 to 13.3% last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Metzger said part of the change can be explained by black people leaving Detroit faster than white people  &mdash;  making white people a bigger percentage of those who stay.</p>
<p>But there are definitely more white people, particularly younger ones without children and empty nesters, moving into Detroit, he said.</p>

		<p>If you are childless and can find a neighborhood to gentrify perhaps you can find some good deals but you better have a very good security system.  I would just be very leery to move there because blacks can drive into your neighborhood and rob/rape/murder you very easily.  A neighborhood that is known for being white and either an over 55 area or a gay area will be especially victimized.  And if you aren&rsquo;t old or gay and have children you have to pay for private school.  And the children must be driven to school because the kids wouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk the streets.  Seems like a bad idea for anyone.</p>

		<p>I am betting a lot of those &#8220;young whites&#8221; are gay white males snapping up lovely old houses for restoration. White gay males claimed a large part of the lovely old Atlanta ghetto neighborhoods and when they became the majority the young white families were able to move in.</p>
<p>Atlanta is now turning white majority after many decades.</p>

		<p>You can bet that as soon as these whites start to improve the neighborhood, two things will happen: blacks will yammer about gentrification and how whites are taking over their neighborhoods (blacks even call it &#8220;negro removal&#8221; instead of urban renewal), and the very whites who spent their money labor and lives (there will be blood, you watch) rebuilding a necrotic neighborhood will bend over with aplomb and accede to black&rsquo;s outcry that this is THEIR neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Sadly, this may be thge answer to reclaiming some territory.  After the blacks have completely laid waste to a zone and abandoned it to go fallow, whites can trickle in and take the cities back.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those clueless young whites are generally liberal &#8220;artists&#8221; (in other words, deadbeats) who also buy drugs in great quantities.  This will keep the gang economy going.</p>

		<p>Many cities are being gentrified by a return of whites.  Because I love cities, I welcome this.  Unfortunately, the pioneers of this movement are in nearly as much danger as pioneers on the American frontier were during white settlement.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The data show that black people continued to move from Detroit to Macomb County, where the black population rose from 7.2% of in 2008 to 8% in 2009.

<p>What is very interesting to speculate about,  is what if most major American cities (like Detroit or Atlanta) start to become majority white in the next 25 or 50 years, while the suburbs and the country as a whole become majority nonwhite. This would ironically put the USA into a similar position of South Africa during the &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo; old days of  Apartheid; most whites were concentrated in the cities, with the vast majority of nonwhites and a moderate smattering of agriculturally dominant whites living in the rural areas. </p>
<p>This would be to future white people&rsquo;s advantage, as cites are strategically located for economic and transportation reasons. Also, they allow for large groups of people social and cultural outlets at shorter distances. Or put another way, the offer a greater degree of opportunity for both technological progress and civilization&rsquo;s other benefits.</p>
<p>In a future where racial warfare is all too possible, such a situation, so long as agricultural and food distribution is protected, could unfairly tip the balance of resources to whites astronomically. Also, should these areas of &ldquo;gentrified&rdquo; prosperity suddenly be balanced against a now &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; but also deteriorating nonwhite suburbia, racial realties might begin to become more of a sociopolitical norm.</p>
<p>A speculative long shot, but one worth considering  &mdash;  John PM!</p>

<p>When I read this I thought, ok, there&rsquo;s an influx of Palestinians/Arabs or some other Census designated White group into Detroit but the article goes on to explain the real reason:</p>
<p>&#8220;Metzger said part of the change can be explained by black people leaving Detroit faster than white people &mdash; making white people a bigger percentage of those who stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words black flight is making the tiny White population grow in relation to the black population.  I don&rsquo;t think Detroit is the kind of place that can be gentrified.  Sure, you can buy some very cheap lots for less than a $1,000 but your yearly tax bill will be horrendous.  The city council members and the mayor would have to be thrown out of office to make any serious changes take place.</p>

PBS aired a program called &#8220;Flag Wars&#8221; in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/" rel="nofollow">https://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/</a></p>
<p>It documented the clash between gays moving into a black area of Columbus, Ohio and refurbished old houses.</p>
<p>The term Flag Wars came from the fact that as gays moved in, they put up rainbow flags while the blacks put up their black nationalist flags.</p>
<p>Something of the reverse has happened here in Buffalo.</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s, gays began congregating in an area called Allentown and fixing up all the old Victorian style houses. When AIDS hit, gays either died or moved out. Since then, blacks have reclaimed the area. It looks as ratty as it ever did.</p>
<p>A new gay-friendly area has since flourished further north which is now called &#8220;The Elmwood Strip&#8221;. The people who live their are an eclectic mix of white families, yuppies, college kids, gays, and some blacks and Hispanics. The area is very multicultural and seems to be thriving mainly because it&rsquo;s tightly controlled by gay dominated community groups.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe most multicultural communities actually work but this one seems to be working; but as I said, it&rsquo;s controlled by &#8216;the gay mafia&rsquo; who work to make it work. Think of it as a &#8216;gay benevolent dictatorship&rsquo;. As long as they remain in control, they take a live-and-let-live attitude about who lives there as long as everyone respect them and abides by their community standards.</p>
<p>I have no problem with it except that such an arrangement is never allowed for white communities. </p>

		<p>This is a heartening trend, whether or not it&rsquo;s a gay thing.  We&rsquo;re talking about more white people.  People who work, pay taxes, don&rsquo;t commit crimes, start businesses, and in general, mind their own business.  Besides, Detroit has a rich rock n&rsquo; roll tradition   &mdash;   think Ted Nugent, Bob Seger, Iggy Pop, the MC5, Outrageous Cherry, Marshall Crenshaw and Jack White (White Stripes, Raconteurs). And consider the new TV show, &#8220;Detroit 187.&#8221;  (Yeah, I know, a &#8220;187&#8221; is police talk for murder, but nobody&rsquo;s gonna mess with a TV production crew, especially if it expands the tax base). </p>
<p>This may be Renaissance II, baby. A rebirth for the Motor City.  Dig it.  And if white-haters don&rsquo;t like it&hellip;well, leave. </p>

		<p>Detroit is unique. No other non-warfare urban area has lost population since the 1950&rsquo;s, much less the half that Detroit has lost. Detroit can not do the traditional things and move back up. They really, really have to do something new. Maybe urban farming and massive non-children groups is their near-term solution. It actually makes sense to close half to two thirds of the city to residential &amp; commercial zoning and turn it into parks and farms. What other city anywhere would even consider this?</p>

<p>First blacks chase whites out of cities and into the suburbs. Then, later, blacks chase whites out of the suburbs and back into the cities. </p>
<p>Problem is, the KIND of young whites who would think the postapocalyptic milieu of bombed-out Detroit is &#8220;cool&#8221; are the kind of whites who are NO USE to us at all. In NYC in the &rsquo;90s we used to call whites who moved into ghetto areas of Brooklyn, &#8220;homesteaders.&#8221; These kinds of smugly suicidal young middle-to-upper-middle-class caucasians have post-grad degrees in Post-Structuralist Semiotics; they are stridently &#8220;post-racial&#8221; Obama voters; they are black-positive in general; and they have NO IDEA what they&rsquo;re getting into.</p>
<p>Gotta admit though, the prospect of owning a 3-bdrm house for a few thousand dollars   &mdash;   even in a horrible neighborhood   &mdash;   is mighty tempting&hellip; <br>

		<p>Urban pioneering is a great thing.  We built those cities in the first place, we may as well take them back.  After all, we now know the blacks are going to keep following us further and further- may as well head them off at the pass and retreat back to from whence we came.  It will take them much longer to catch up to us this way-they&rsquo;ll spend a long time in the suburbs we built for them, because they have long felt entitled to the suburban life.  They sit in the &#8216;burbs they&rsquo;re ruining and feel like they really stuck it to whitey, &#8216;cuz now whitey in da ghetto!</p>
<p>There are right ways and wrong ways to do this.  The right way- it should be an area with great, solid old architecture of some historic interest, close to the business hub of a city. It should have a level of abandonment, and be going for dirt cheap, fire sale prices. A little business strip helps a whole lot- you want to get the enterprising shop owners in there, too.  Plus, their business taxes speak very loudly to the city council!</p>
<p>Often it starts with the artsy types and.  Do not discount them- they do some great work, and they smooth the way as far as getting the neighborhood more used to whites.  A poster above said that they&rsquo;re all drug addicts that fuel the blight in the neighborhood- this is so very untrue.  No doubt, there will be a couple of those- gutterpunks- generally the Pioneers will put the pressure on them to clean up their act or move on. I&rsquo;ve actually seen this process change them into better people-they like feeling like they&rsquo;re part of something.  If not, they&rsquo;re the type that grumbles about &#8220;the Man being unjust and gentrifying&#8221; or somesuch, and they move on to the next blighted neighborhood and plant the seeds to start the whole process again there.  It works out for everybody.  Follow them. <br>
Next, the contractor, work with their hands guys that are usually pretty tough and well armed buy stuff and fix it up.  They stay, and sell some to the young and brave that want to be close to work and feel they can hack it.  Knowing that they bought a refurbished house for a profit, they try their hand at this.  The process repeats itself.  Soon, more people are looking to do things the sweat equity way.  The gays come along.  Fear not- they do beautiful work on old houses.  They make great, quiet neighbors and they call the police for EVERYTHING.  This is how you will bring police protection back to the area, get in Architectural Digest, and make your property values soar.  Thus encouraging yet more of the element that brings the place down to sell.</p>
<p>At this point, things are looking great.  Your neighborhood may have gotten attention in some architectural/style magazines.  Prices are going up quick- more people want to start getting in on the ground floor.  This is when the ghetto denizens start leaving.  It&rsquo;s a myth that they&rsquo;re being &#8220;pushed out by whitey&#8221;- bull.  They want to unload that heap that&rsquo;s been in the family for years, because suddenly, they can get money for it they never dreamed they&rsquo;d get.  At this point, a Historic Preservation Guild/ Neighborhood Association type thing forms.  Now there are RULES about what this neighborhood can look like.  If all this pans out, you end up with property that is now assessed at prices you could never have afforded- actual wealthy people begin to move in.  Ghetto people take the money and run laughing.  It annoys me when blacks grumble about gentrification- the ones grumbling are those that didn&rsquo;t have this happen to THEIR neighborhood, and they didn&rsquo;t end up with a sack of dough.</p>
<p>Grumble they will, and this brings us what can go wrong.  I&rsquo;ve seen this attempted in places like Seattle.  They work their butts off, pour money into it, jealous blacks grumble, and they immediately set about seeing how much section 8 housing they can develop for the poor dear blacks, so they can assuage their white guilt by moving in blacks who never even lived there before, but that&rsquo;s OK, they&rsquo;re black.  This will bring the place back to square one, quickly.  You CAN&rsquo;t backslide.</p>
<p>Make no bones about it, this is NOT an easy way to do things.  I came into my neighborhood when it was about 30% white.  It was pretty rough going, for quite awhile. This WILL involve security systems and dogs.  I&rsquo;ve heard some hair raising tales from the First Settlers.  Most people that do this don&rsquo;t have kids, but for those that do, it will involve private schools and close supervision with planned activities, play dates, etc.  I&rsquo;m taking for granted that you would be doing this in a city with a failure of a public school system, as is usually the case.  If not, that would be getting really lucky.  The goal is that eventually, enough of the surrounding area will follow suit that you would also get your district&rsquo;s public school to completely change.  I&rsquo;ve seen that happen.</p>
<p>My neighborhood went from a cracktown that nobody sane got within a mile of to being a very famous historic district with books about it, tourism, and a noted shopping/entertainment district.</p>
<p>Detroit is interesting, it has some great bones, and it just couldn&rsquo;t be cheaper.  At barely 13% white in a city that large, that&rsquo;s some VERY serious pioneering. Way too much for me, but maybe in a decade or so. I don&rsquo;t doubt it will happen on some scale, at least to some areas, but it will take a very long time.</p>

		<p>One important thing to note about the &#8220;white&#8221; people in Detroit: Most of them are Arab or Palestinian convenience store owners. In surveys that include &#8220;ethnic preference,&#8221; Arabs, Jews, and North Africans (!) are categorized, parenthetically, as &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is actually good news. I&rsquo;m embarrassed by the lack of fortitude that Whites display by running from Blacks. Whites run away claiming that they want to &#8220;feel safe,&#8221; but this is just another way to say that they&rsquo;re just too docile to cope with Blacks. Whites are some of the greatest warriors in the world and it&rsquo;s about time that we raised our young men to learn to defend not only themselves, but other Whites as well. </p>

		<p>This is good news - and make no mistake, the White folks moving back to Detroit - might be very liberal, lots of gays, but few will be idiots on racial matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just impossible to live in a city like Detroit - even in a better neighborhood and not be aware that you are surrounding by hundreds of thousands of dangerous, hostile Blacks.</p>
<p>These Whites going to Detroit might not be right wing Conservatives, fly the Rebel flag or be open White racialists, instead they will be working in areas like bringing birth control and family planning to urban areas. They will work to find decent Black or mixed race women to run city politics. </p>
<p>The Children of even the most liberal Whites growing up in such places will be very racially aware. If they aren&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll get killed off.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone reading Amren to get White American back in to the real world and experience racial realities. This is the best education, really the only thing that works.</p>

		<p>Detroit would be an ideal place for racially aware whites to move en masse, buy up the whole city and rebuild it.  We would be better off doing that than this idea of moving to the rural Northwest.  Cities are where the power and money are.  It&rsquo;s been this way since the dawn of civilization.  Who owns the cities owns the society.  </p>

		<p>Land in Detroit must be dirt cheap.  I can imagine an innovative entrepreneur (please forgive me if I misspelled that) buying up whole blocks of abandoned Detroit property, and turning the city around one neighborhood at a time.  Homes could be restored, security guards hired and a small fence put up, and rich whites would probably flock to the newly-gentrified neighborhoods.  Wealthy people love to live in the city center, provided it is relatively sheltered from the ills of the surrounding ghettos.  Just look at the property values in places like New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.  All are filled with minorities, and have high crime rates, but are still very attractive to cultural, educated, upper-class white people.  So I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all if the city made a miraculous turn around someday soon.  Detroit has, after all, reached a point so low that I honestly can&rsquo;t imagine it getting any worse, only better.</p>

I wonder if it would be possible to reconfigure some of the streets to divert the dangerous element out of the white areas?  With so much of the city now vacant land, it could be possible to make any streets connecting into dangerous areas into dead ends.  Other phyisical barriers between safe and unsafe neighborhoods could be rivers and canals.  Sort of like a medieval walled city.</p>

		<p>My guess is that it doesn&rsquo;t have as much to do with young whites thinking Detroit is cool as the fact that the economy is still very weak, especially in Michigan, and housing in Detroit is very cheap. The east end of the city still has a mostly white population and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if whites are slowly working their way westward across the city.</p>
