<h1>Canadians Don&rsquo;t Believe Muslims Share Their Values: Poll</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Thompson, National Post (Toronto), September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nine years after the devastating 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, a majority of Canadians don&rsquo;t believe Muslims share their values, according to a new public opinion poll released exclusively to Postmedia.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted earlier this week by Leger Marketing in Canada and Caravan in the United States, found that 55% of Canadian respondents and 50.3% of Americans disagreed when asked whether &#8220;Muslims share our values.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the poll reveals there are also significant regional differences in the way Muslims are viewed in Canada. While 72% of Quebecers said Muslims didn&rsquo;t share their values, compared to 19% who said they do, that rate dropped to 35.5% in British Columbia where 40.8% saw shared values with Muslims.</p>
<p>Ontario and Alberta were closer to the national average. In Ontario, 54.5% said Muslims don&rsquo;t share their values, compared to 34.9% who said they do, while in Alberta 57.9% of Albertans said values weren&rsquo;t shared, compared to 32.4% who said they were.</p>
<p>Jack Jedwab, executive director of the Association for Canadian Studies, which commissioned the poll along with the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, said the opinion Canadians have of Muslims has been deteriorating over the past few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the principal thing that worries me when you see these results is the tendency to generalize,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a tendency to see an incident arising with someone who is Muslim or a group of people who are Muslim are involved and there seems to be a ready tendency to generalize to the entire group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayman Al Yassini, executive director of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, agreed the situation is getting worse and suggested Canada&rsquo;s Muslim community reach out more to other Canadians.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have to communicate the true nature of Islam and build bridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Older respondents in both countries were more likely to feel that Muslims share their values. While only 43.5% of Canadian 18- 24-year-olds felt that way, the rate rose to 70% among those 65 years old and older.</p>
<p>One of the biggest divides was between English- and French-speaking Canadians. The poll found 49.7% of English Canadians didn&rsquo;t feel Muslims share their values (compared with 37.9% who felt they do). However, among French respondents, 74% said Muslims didn&rsquo;t share their values and only 17.4% thought they did.</p>
<p>Among those whose first language was neither English nor French, 52.3% said Muslims didn&rsquo;t share their values.</p>
<p>Jedwab said controversies and media reports in Quebec over the past few years on questions such as the reasonable accommodation of ethnic minorities or Muslim women wearing the niqab face veil likely contributed to the attitudes among Quebecers and francophones.</p>
<p>The surveys were conducted via the web during the week of Sept. 6 with 1,700 respondents in Canada and 1,000 in the U.S. The Canadian survey is considered accurate to within 2.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, while the American survey is considered accurate to within 3.5 percentage points.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;Canadian Race Relations Foundation&#8221;  That organization alone is proof that multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work.  If it did that organization wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Question to the Candian elites:  wouldn&rsquo;t it have made more sense to get Anglo-Canadians and Franco-Canadians to get along, to accept a common culture, a common Monarch, and a common future before really screwing things up with Haitians, Siks and heaven knows what else?  I mean if two weestern European peoples have a hard time getting on what ever made you think more ingrediants of radically different flavors would make things even better.</p>
<p>That is a question I would like to pose to American elites as well:  considering how little luck we have had assimilating blacks what makes you think Hispanics, Indians and Orientals will make things better?</p>
<p>If I put too much salt in my soup will adding pepper make it better tasting?</p>

		<p>Good to see there is sanity left in Canada.  Of course the first people that will refute the common sense attiutude displayed in this poll will probably be &#8220;conservative&#8221; politicians blabbering about stereotypes and islamophobia or other such nonsense.  I really can&rsquo;t think of anything worse than living in a country with a sizeable Moslem population.  </p>

		<p>Quebec&rsquo;s majority had it right 40 yrs ago. Get the &#8220;heck&#8221; out of Canada ASAP. Since 1970, Canada has become a dumping ground for the ilk of South and East Asia, as well as the Caribbean. The English values of Canada outside of Quebec are kaput. </p>
<p>And the European French Catholic values of Quebec are now in dire danger. Montreal, a great French metropolis and citadel of Western arts and culture, is toppling over into Toronto-like multiculturism.</p>
<p>France, trying to escape its own Muslim nightmare, would I believe, support a Quebec secession if done by nonviolent means. </p>
<p>The USA?  Ha. Ha. Toronto is Obama&rsquo;s dream for the USA.</p>

&#8220;While only 43% of (young Canadians) felt Muslims shared their values, the rate rose to 70% among those 65 years old and older.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
Many of these old retired folks who believe &#8220;Muslims share their values&#8221; are out of touch and have little knowledge of Muslims. In retirement, they look away from touble.</p>
<p>Youth can see it in their daily experience, on the internet, on social networking sites, and in the news.  They&rsquo;re less susceptable to heavy-handed media portrayals of multicultural bliss.</p>
<p>The generation gap is also the information gap.</p>

		<p>Muslim adherents don&rsquo;t share white people&rsquo;s values.  Right now Americans are being held hostage by muslim adherents over a proposed mosque near Ground Zero.  If the mosque doesn&rsquo;t get built muslims will threaten people&rsquo;s lives and might attack and if the mosque does get built it will be an ideological training center to breed muslims so hateful of &#8220;Westerners&#8221; that they attack.  Muslim adherents like black and Latino people like to make a fuss.  In the last several years muslim adherents have cordinated events to set up lawsuits to generate sympathic headlines and force themselves on Americans like a muslim woman who went to work at Walt Disney World only to turn around a few months later to sue them for not allowing her to wear a burka.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for another survey. Ask Muslims if they think other Canadians would benefit by joining Islam. Specifically in  what ways would other Canadians be improved by the conversion. Also ask Muslims if their own personal lives would be less if they abandoned the Muslim religion to become like other Canadians. </p>

North Americans do not need to look as far as the violent crime and terrorism committed by Muslims in Canada in the 21st century<br/>
to realize that Muslims do not share the values of whites.<br/>
In 1998 while visiting Victoria a Muslim nearly jumped <br/>
from a horse drawn carriage to attack me as he was celebrating with a bottle of alcohol.<br/>
Yet during my three week stay prior to the incident I traveled from morning to 2:00 am without incident due solely to the fact that the people in the area were entirely white.<br/>
A month later Muslims driving to Seattle from Canada had atttempted to blow up the Space Needle in Seattle Washington with<br/>
an unrigged bomb carried in the trunk of their car.<br/>
Canadians must realize that total and complete racial and demographic seperation is fundemental to keeping their values<br/>
togeather.</p>

		<p>Interesting that the negative feelings towards Muslims are highest in Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. That&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s where most of the Muslims in Canada have settled. There&rsquo;s nothing like direct contact with such persons to cure most white Canadians of multicultural delusions.</p>

<p><br/>
Wow! A Muslim who actually suggests that HIS side should &#8220;reach out&#8221; to white people   &mdash;   instead of saying that whites should reach out more to the minority in question, which is what they say 99% of the time. </p>
<p>But as much as I appreciate this uncharacteristic self-searching and self-criticism from a minority for a change, I as a North American white am NOT INTERESTED in being &#8220;reached out to&#8221; by Muslims. Muslims reaching out to Infidels will NEVER be about anything more than propagandizing the Infidels to accept either (a) Islam, or (b) the second-class status of a jizya-paying dhimmi under Islamic domination. </p>
<p>NRA supporters are fond of saying &#8220;You can have my gun when you can pry it out of my cold dead fingers.&#8221; Well my response to Islamic outreach is along the same lines: &#8220;I will accept either of the above options only after you saw my head off with a rusty scimitar.&#8221; </p>
<p>Do Muslims in Canada and other Western countries have a bad reputation among the locals that? Yes. Will outreach help? No. The only thing that will help is for the Muslims to GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. </p>
<p>The solution to &#8220;Muslim problems&#8221; in the West is incredibly simple: No more Muslims, no more Muslim problems. </p>

As they should ally with their cousins  in France. Muslims are here in North America for one thing only&hellip;.the total destruction of our values. And as such..need to be confronted forcefully.</p>

<p>Gosh, d&rsquo;you really think so?  Imagine that!  How horrible!  Time to rack up the Hate Speech penalties again and run more Diversity programming on Canadian TeeVee.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;However, among French respondents, 74% said Muslims didn&rsquo;t share their values&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d better make sure that plenty of that Diversity programming is bilingual, too.  Can&rsquo;t have those Frenchies getting away with all that Hate, eh?</p>
<p>It should surprise no one to learn that Jack Jedwab&rsquo;s &#8220;Association for Canadian Studies&#8221; is a well-funded mouthpiece for the Canadian government&rsquo;s diversicrats:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wnq9g2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2wnq9g2</a></p>
<p>And Jedwab himself is a hard-core multiculturalist:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/3xfkpsj</p>
<p>Just the sort of fellow to be deciding that Canadians aren&rsquo;t tolerant enough of &#8220;the true nature of Islam,&#8221; eh?<br/>

		<p>The first thing I noticed was that the study was performed the week of the World Trade Center bombing. So they were obviously looking for higher numbers of those who didn&rsquo;t think moslems shared their values. The second thing I noticed was that none of those quoted in this story bothered to consider that the people polled might be <i>right</i>.</p>

		<p>I wish White people were as quick to assert that Blacks, Hispanics, Southeast Asians, and Hindus to name but a few, did not share our values either! Muslims are still, for the most part, the safe non-white/non-western group to take issue with. There are others every bit as dangerous and destructive - moreso in certain cases.   </p>

<p>FRED! if you seriously believe that, YOU are part of the problems we have. BELIEVE THIS! the muslims are the greatest danger facing the civilized world today, and it will only end with the destruction of the muslim creed, to include the total destruction of Mecca and Medina or OUR destruction via submission, conversion, enslavement or DEATH under islamic sharia&hellip;so TAKE YOUR PICK Fred.</p>
