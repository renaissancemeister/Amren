<h1>But Why Do Blacks Distrust Hospitals?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Third Position, September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Medical journals this past week reported on a new study which tried to explain why so few blacks donate blood by claiming that they &#8220;do not trust hospitals,&#8221; but all ignored the obvious question: why?</p>
<p>The study, published in the official blood bank association journal Transfusion, revealed &#8220;that there is a significant distrust in the healthcare system among the African American community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Led by Beth H. Shaz, MD, Chief Medical Officer of the New York Blood Center in New York, New York, researchers apparently managed to create a survey which explored the &#8220;reasons for low likelihood of blood donation in African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Statistically, only one in ten blood donors are black, even though that community is a major user of donated blood due to a higher violent crime rate and subsequent greater attendance at emergency units.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the new study, 15 black churches in Atlanta participated in an 81-item self-administered survey, with 930 people responding to the survey.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s results demonstrate that about one in five African American individuals (17 percent) do not trust hospitals. This &#8220;lack of trust&#8221; was positively correlated with not donating blood even compared against other risk factors.</p>
<p>The study concluded that hospitals had to &#8220;increase trust&#8221; to overcome the problem.</p>
<p>Yet none of the journals which repeated the story, ever bothered to ask the simple question of why there was such a &#8220;lack of trust&#8221; in hospitals amongst blacks.</p>
<p>The answer would appear to be so obvious as to be unpalatable, and hence preferably ignored by the journals and academics, namely that the black community simply does not have the same degree of social responsibility that other communities, particularly the European-American community, has.</p>
<p>Rather than admit this obvious truth, liberal academics would prefer to invent all manner of &#8220;reasons&#8221; for the low black blood donation rate  &mdash;  hence the patently fabricated excuses of &#8220;no trust&#8221; without any attempt to explain why that &#8220;situation&#8221; has arisen.</p>

		<p>I am not sure if this is part of the enmity between Blacks and hospitals, but I have read numerous times over the years that many Blacks believe Aids and HIV are a government conspiracy against the Black community. If many do believe this, it could explain the distrust towards hospitals.</p>

		<p>Hospitals are a product of Western, i.e. White, civilization, hence Blacks do not trust them.  There are also several other factors.  Blacks will be confronted by the medical staff (White people) about their lifestyle and asked what behaviors they engage in that lead to their poor health - junk food diet, drug abuse, various criminal activites.  Said Doctors will then proscribe some kind of health regime and Blacks may take that as The White Man ordering them around. Finally there is the hospital bill.  Most of the money will eventually paid by the taxpayers and insurance customers through higher premiums but there is still all that paperwork, remembering names and addresses, and who wants to deal with that.</p>

<p><i>The study concluded that hospitals had to &ldquo;increase trust&rdquo; to overcome the problem.</i></p>
<p><br>
Maybe doctors can give their black patients lollipops at the end of their checkups. </p>
<p>But only if they&rsquo;ve been <i>good</i> little boys and girls, and have <i>behaved</i> themselves that is. </p>
<p>Otherwise, no lollipop!</p>
<p>Clearly I&rsquo;m joking   &mdash;   but isn&rsquo;t that what this is really all about? A &#8220;distrust&#8221; of medicine about on the maturity level of a white gradeschooler? Young children don&rsquo;t like going to the doctor or the dentist either, and sometimes for the same reason: out of a baseless fear rooted in ignorance and incomprehension. They don&rsquo;t understand why they have to go see the strange man in the strange room, and so they find the whole experience somewhat frightening. </p>
<p>Usually, however, by the time white children get to be about 12 or so, they&rsquo;ve matured enough to comprehend that the doctor is not there to hurt them; and that visiting the doctor may not be pleasant but it&rsquo;s <i>necessary</i> to keep yourself well. Consequently, virtually ZERO white people hold onto a childish fear of medical profession into adulthood&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;As opposed to almost one-in-five blacks, apparently. </p>

		<p>what does trust in hospitals have to do with donating blood? I don&rsquo;t trust hospitals all that much either because how can you trust an institution that charges you exorbitant and often not even disclosed prices for services whose usefulness and quality are hard to evaluate (and hard to take on faith in this age of incompetence and cynicism), as a result causing you all manner of long term headache?</p>
<p>Further, blacks constitute around 10% of American population at present. So, if anything, I am surprised that the number of black donors is so high.</p>

		<p>Oh, c&rsquo;mon, get real!  Blacks don&rsquo;t trust hospitals?  Since when? <br>
Go to any hospital Emergency Room, day and/or night, and the place is loaded with &#8216;em.  They use hospital ER&rsquo;s in place of doctor&rsquo;s appts.  They will sit in ER&rsquo;s with complaints of headaches, colds, coughs, drunkeness, etc.  They are constantly seeking medical attention for trivial complaints.</p>

<p>If you are a person with a relatively developed frontal lobe, and you, like me, have a chronic medical condition, and have had it for as long as you remember, you learn to look forward to doctors offices and ERs at an even earlier age. </p>
<p>Some of my formative experiences with the health care realm was that I woke up in the middle of the night finding it hard to breathe   &mdash;   The next thing I know, I was in the ER getting a shot in the arm with a syringue and needle of a drug (turned out to be adrenaline), and within a minute or so, my asthma attack was gone.  Eventually, as I progressed through childhood, I knew that seeing doctors when I didn&rsquo;t seem sick meant that they would give me medicine and suggest other things to keep me from getting sick as much as possible.</p>
<p>By the time I got to 12, my mindset was so advanced that I was able to deduce that when my new allergist changed my inhaler prescription, and I found no difference in my new inhaler and old inhaler in terms of dosage and active ingredient, and nothing else other than the drug manufacturer, and the new allergist not so coincidentally had ink pens, pads, and other accoutrements with the logo of that drug company, I came to understand that there were links between physicians and drug companies.</p>

		<p>I was in a doctor&rsquo;s office with relatively thin walls between exam rooms several years back. I saw a large, middle-aged black woman go into the exam room next to me. After a few minutes, I heard the doctor exhaustedly try to explain to her why she needed a myelogram, or dye test, on one of her legs. The response was a screaming, &#8220;Oh, no, no-suh!! No, no, you not gwanna do that! Dye&rsquo;ll make you die!!&#8221;</p>
<p>A large part of mistrust of hospitals (and doctors for that matter) by blacks is pure &amp; simple ignorance.</p>

		<p>Actually I wish Blacks would donate more blood. They have two problems.The first one is that Black blood does not have certain red blood cell antigens which are very commonly found in white peoples blood. So if they are transfused with white blood they often develop anti-bodies against most types of white blood. It becomes very difficult to find blood for transfusions. The fact is many times a unit of blood might be considered compatible based purely upon the race of the donor. The other problem is that Blacks are often born with sickle cell anemia. These people periodically receive transfusions mostly from white people. They develop antibodies where if they had been white they might not done so. Amren should do an article about the myth that all blood is equal. I would send a copy to Sam Waterson.</p>

		<p>Ronin - 3 hit this right on the head.  Hospitals, often using the most advanced technologies and highly educated personnel and management, are overwhelmingly staffed by whites, excepting maids and clean-up personnel. Hence, they are the province of de man.</p>

<p>It is not the function of hospitals to manipulate people&rsquo;s political or cultural outlook.  The hospitals must treat people with injuries and illnesses, and that is ALL, nothing more.</p>

<p>Most black folks are NOT EVEN AWARE of the Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221; STUDY! That is not even a consideration for them. This attribution is constantly stated but is not for real. Was NOT even an &#8220;experiment&#8221; anyhow, that is poppycock. There NEVER was a Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221;!</p>
<p>Most black folks too do not make for good blood donors or donors of any type anyhow. Too many medical problems from bad lifestyle preclude their being donors for ANYTHING!</p>
<p>AND black folks too because of stabbings and shootings ARE big time USERS of donated blood, most of that blood coming from the hated whitey. </p>
<p>I suppose too that those blacks donating blood, those that could, probably believed that their donated blood was strictly being used for treating a brother or sister in peril. Maybe was used for a transfusion into a whitey? </p>

		<p>Blacks mistrust hospitals?  Then why does every big hospital in an urban area seem to hire nothing but them these days?  I was in a big St. Louis hospital complex one day last week, and above their front entrance desk was a hanging banner welcoming their new  non-physician employees.  Most of the names (and they only showed first names, save duplicates which had the first letter of the last name,) sounded black.  Including &#8220;Deshontavious,&#8221; three instances of &#8220;Keisha,&#8221; and at least a half dozen names with the obligatory contraction.  </p>

		<p>I worked in healthcare for a long time and came to believe that blacks expect substandard care and are always on the watch for it.  Many of them refuse to allow very old, failing family members to go peacefully and insist that every measure be done to keep them alive.  <br>
As far as giving blood, I wonder what the racial percentage is among those who SELL their blood?</p>

		<p>There is another elephant in the room.  A lot of blacks are afraid that if they go to donate blood (which is screened and tested) they will find out they have aids or any number of other horrible diseases.</p>
<p>I am frankly happy that black donors are rare because I don&rsquo;t trust the blood supply as it is.  Can you imagine if every dequan and lashondalicious were donating blood?  </p>
<p>Do you want african DNA flowing through your veins, possibly tainted with diseases and viruses that the low class black &#8216;nurse&rsquo; expertly took from you, following all proper sanitary procedures (not)?</p>
<p>Also, donating blood is an unpleasant experience.  You have to sit there and have a needle in your arm draining your life away.  Only civic duty makes a person do that, and most blacks are not known for such altruism.</p>
<p>Since blacks use a disproportionate amount of blood due to gun violence, simply require that any victim&rsquo;s relatives must donate the blood to save their kin at the time of operation.  Problem solved.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white, give blood regularly, &amp; I don&rsquo;t trust hospitals either.  A better quesion is why does anyone trust them?  There&rsquo;s an endless series of horror stories coming from each of them.  The employees are often overweight or obese, &amp; many are non-white &amp; foreign.</p>

<p>Blacks have NO concept of altruism or helping others. Look at the difference between BLACK areas in katrina vs. whites. Whites helped each other, blacks ran out and looted.</p>
<p>giving blood is a act of altruism. Blacks have zero concept of this. I bet the real numbers are 1000 to 1. </p>

		<p>I see no obvious connection between giving blood and not trusting hospitals. I have donated blood at my work several times, at a number of shopping malls, at parks, at a carnival and one time at a local ribfest. I never had to go anywhere near any hospital to do so. I live in a heavily, racially mixed area where there are many blacks. In all my days I can recall only one single black ever giving blood. Essentially it is a selfless act of altruism. These are simply not characteristics of blacks generally or their communities. </p>

		<p>I find the rate of black blood donation cited in this article to be suspiciously high.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they are lumping &#8220;donations&#8221; together with &#8220;directed donations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if DeShawn is shot and rushed to the hospital, the staff may ask all the family members showing up to donate blood, because DeShawn might need it, and the family members will probably do so.  I&rsquo;d be willing to believe that blacks working for large corporations and government offices might go to the bloodmobile to give blood if it means getting out of the office for an hour while still being paid for the time.</p>
<p>I no longer donate blood due to health reasons, but when I DID donate, I never saw a black or Hispanic donate blood.  These donations were done at college campuses, so the only payoff would have been cookies &amp; juice.  No doubt blacks SELL their blood, but I don&rsquo;t think that they often GIVE it away for use by STRANGERS.</p>

		<p>Blacks may not trust hospitals, but they sure don&rsquo;t mind using them. Whenever they suffer from knife or gunshot wounds, or are ready to deliver a baby, or whatever service they need, they show up at the emergency room expecting, and getting, free service.</p>
<p>They are not about giving, but taking. They have no respect for anyone. How could they when they have no respect even for themselves?</p>

		<p>In Canada, immigrants from China and India are also hesitant to give blood and sign up to be bone marrow or organs donors.  I think it is because they come from corrupt, low-trust cultures, so they have that mind set.  Maybe it is the same with African Americans.  </p>
<p>Racial minorities in Canada typically have to wait much longer for bone marrow or an organ donation.  Sometimes various organizations have drives to try and encourage more of them to become donors. </p>

It is not only about benefiting whites. It has more to do with instant gratification and the inability to see long term benefits. That is why they don&rsquo;t care about school, saving money, or keeping their neighborhood clean. School is only a place to pick up girls and make drug deals. There is no need for them to safe money because evil whitey will always provide. And there is a white sucker born every minute to feel sorry for them and clean up their  neighborhood. It is true that blacks have the racial integrity to help their own people, unlike the animal known as the White Stupidicus Americanus.</p>

		<p>Actually, the fact that 10% of the blood doners are black fairly closely matches their representation in the general population.  There is no problem with this percentage of donation.  It is more of a problem to whites getting the blood.</p>
<p>And trust;  when someone with no money and no insurance such as your average black or Mexican, gets presented with a bill at least twice as high as the negotiated bill for a properly insured patient, they have reason not to trust!</p>

		<p>Another factor may be the belief that having their blood in another body may cause the donor to suffer supernatural damage. This was told to me by several Blacks, although they claimed that they did not believe it to be a major threat &hellip; usually &hellip; especially if the donor were a good Christian&hellip;but, &hellip; well,&hellip; you know, &hellip; why take chances with the Spirits.

<p>I would put the &#8220;health&#8221; in &#8220;health industry&#8221; in quotes. They are great for certain things, like healing wounds and taking out diseased organs, but not much else. Just look at all the hype over dangerous, untested and, at best, useless vaccines.</p>
<p>BTW - blood can&rsquo;t be sold, but blood plasma can be. At least that used to be the case. But I would hate to be a recipient of it &#8216;cause of who is selling it - drug addicts, active alcoholics, etc.</p>

		<p>As usual, when it comes to blacks, the true reasons will simply be ignored or media manipulated if it in anyway might cast &#8216;aspersions&rsquo; on the black population. Because nothing negative must always be silenced. Turning a light on a population whose very own leaders do not expect them to act in a socially responsible manner simply cannot be tolerated. Their black leaders and our ridiculously irresponsible power structure will simply label it RACIST. I mean, it&rsquo;s worked so well up to now, HASN&rsquo;T IT?  (sarcasm off)</p>
