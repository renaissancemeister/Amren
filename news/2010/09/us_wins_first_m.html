<h1>US Wins First Meeting With Iran, Stays Unbeaten</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Mahoney, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the political arena, Iran vs. the United States is a matchup that gets attention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The United States won it easily, earning a top seed in the knockout round of the world championship with an 88-51 victory Wednesday in the first meeting between the countries with a history of contentious relations.</p>
<p>The U.S. team, which downplayed the political aspect of the game, methodically pulled away in the first half, wearing down the Asian champions with its depth and athleticism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s one of the beautiful things about sports,&#8221; U.S. center Lamar Odom said. &#8220;If you think about the history of sports, you take people from different cultures, from different beliefs and bring them together. Sports is the one thing that can kind of bring people together and have a great atmosphere. It was great playing a game like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in a nod to the Iranian supporters in Istanbul  &mdash;  which included minister of sports Ali Saeedlou earlier in the tournament  &mdash;  dancers were ordered to cover up for their performances during the game. Islam prohibits women from exposing their skin in public, and Iranian officials had turned their backs when the dancers performed in earlier games.</p>
<p>The dancers wore long pants Wednesday.</p>

<p>Actually, going farther back in history the US once had good relations with Iran. There are folks in both countries, most likely, who remember that. &#8216;American exceptionalism&rsquo; meant something at one time (and it didn&rsquo;t mean exceptionally evil).</p>

<p>Iranian women do NOT cover their faces so what is this ridiculous comment about? They also wear makeup, snug jeans, designer shoes, etc&hellip;  Either ignorance on the part of the reporter, or intentional propaganda to confuse the simple minded.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think the Moslems were the Romans and the U.S. some weak little backwater state!  Why do we even consider dancing to their tune?  Now a top general (who the left once disparaged as General Betray-Us, no less) is afraid that Moslems may retaliate against his troops if an American preacher burns a Koran!  And, of course, the left is quoting the general as though he were the Black Messiah himself!  Can you imagine that, during WWII, someone had threatened to burn MK and Eisenhower had expressed terror that Germans might retaliate and kill Americans?!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of people in this country groveling to foreign Moslems and no one in the MSM questioning such obsequiousness!  MSNBC even had the gall to run footage of Moslems burning an American flag while whining that a so-called intolerant preacher wants to burn a Koran!  </p>

		<p>We need to stop pandering to these freaks and start actively mocking them.  Evil hates to be mocked  &mdash;  witness our fabulous president Hussein, who claims to have been talked about like a dog when someone criticizes him.  They should have worn pants with pictures of the Grand Ayatollah sewn onto their backsides.  If anyone wants to see someone mock these people incessantly, take a look at the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/27gcfnb" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/27gcfnb</a></p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/29geyr9</p>
<p>Tariq Ramadan is giving youtube hell about the first, and C.A.I.R. has contacted amazon.com over the second.  Burning Korans is counterproductive.  Mocking the Koran shows the thin skin of muslims.  If it&rsquo;s done enough, they&rsquo;ll eventually show their true intentions so well that even liberals may wake up.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for helping me out of my moral dilemma.</p>
<p>One of my very few disagreements with PJB was over the Mohammed cartoon controversy   &mdash;   He though they shouldn&rsquo;t have been drawn, because fundamentalist Muslims are that crazy.  I thought that we shouldn&rsquo;t tip toe around their sensitivities.</p>
<p>Yet, I wish this rinky dink church in Florida wouldn&rsquo;t do the Burn the Koran day on Saturday.  In fact, in spite of my better sensibilities, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if some government, Federal, state, local, whatever, finds some legal pretense to step in and prohibit it.  I can guarantee you that more American soldiers will be killed in Afg than would otherwise be killed if this thing on Saturday happens.</p>
<p>But these are contradictory opinions on my part.  Where you helped me is demonstrating that there is a big difference between mocking (i.e. the cartoons) and blatant disrespect (burning the Korans).  </p>
<p>Two points, though:</p>
<p>*  Evidently, there have already been violent protests in several heavily Muslim cities and countries over this Koran burning event, which hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.  Question:  How did the news get on the other side of the world before it spread through our own country?  I get the feeling that there&rsquo;s something quite not above board with this &#8220;church.&#8221;  I would not be surprised to find out that some radical Muslims are funding this &#8220;church,&#8221; and want this Koran burning to go down, in order to rally Muslims around the world, and to galvanize support for the G0M.</p>
<p>*  If this church is for real, then it is being hypocritical.  I looked at its website, and it&rsquo;s all for whatever prolonged occupation of the Muslim would that the neo-cons can dream up.  So, if, e.g. David Petraeus convinces Obama to convince Holder to send FBI agents in there to stop the Koran burning, then AFAIC, this church will be hoisted on its own petard.  Warfare always leads to the eroding of civil liberties, at least while the war is happening, and often in the long term.</p>

<p>I totally, and respectfully, disagree.  He has the right to do it, but I would not like to see the government stepping in.  Real Christians should protest and put a stop to this.  And  &mdash;  even if it proceeds, it&rsquo;s not this ignorant pastor&rsquo;s fault if our troops get killed.  It&rsquo;s the fault of Muhammad the pedophile, and his retarded followers.  Respectfully, it&rsquo;s like saying Salmon Rushdie was responsible for his death sentence.  Yeah, in a way, he was.  I totally understand the argument  &mdash;  why rattle the cage of a rabid dog, if there is a possibility that the dog might get out of its cage.  But  &mdash;  better yet  &mdash;  rattle that damned cage, and then put that dog down, when it crawls out.  Forever.<br>

<p>To be consistent, then I&rsquo;d have to blame Rushdie for his own execution.  But I don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   In my worldview, I put Rushdie and the cartoons in the same box, while burning Korans is going over a bridge too far.  And yes, I am aware of Muslims burning Bibles, and the famous Afg Bible burning incident a few years ago, wherein American military personnel ordered Bibles in Pashto burned.  But, per the BlueBlood Doctrine, we shouldn&rsquo;t exist just to live more than one iota better than the lowest common denominator.</p>
