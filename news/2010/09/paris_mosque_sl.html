<h1>Paris Mosque Slams Burger Chain&rsquo;s Muslim Outreach</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angela Doland, Google News, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As of this week, 22 outlets of popular French fast food chain Quick are serving burgers it says respect Islamic dietary law. And while many Muslims are delighted, the powerful main Paris Mosque complained Thursday that Quick&rsquo;s criteria aren&rsquo;t all-encompassing enough, and that the operation is meaningless.</p>
<p>Quick&rsquo;s meat is certified as halal, but Cheikh Al Sid Cheikh, assistant to the rector of the Paris Mosque, said the burger chain should have had the other ingredients checked as well, from its mustard to buns to fries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest must be validated too, or else there&rsquo;s no point,&#8221; he told The Associated Press. Quick responded that it has no intention of making any of its restaurants halal through-and-through  &mdash;  beer is still served there, for example, said spokeswoman Valerie Raynal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Quick, the No. 2 burger chain in France after McDonald&rsquo;s, is the latest group to enter the expanding French market for halal food, which has an estimated euro5.5 billion ($7 billion) in annual sales, according to a study by France&rsquo;s Solis marketing agency.</p>
<p>{snip} The Paris Mosque has high praise for Kentucky Fried Chicken France, which it says spent four months consulting with Muslim officials recently about its fare. The chain is a rarity in that it has offered halal food for years  &mdash;  though it never trumpeted the fact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beyond the political chatter, the Paris Mosque&rsquo;s reaction highlights disagreement among France&rsquo;s Muslims about what foods are really halal, who is qualified to decide, and whether the certification agencies are rigorous enough in making sure that animals are slaughtered properly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fateh Kimouche, founder of the French Muslim consumer Web site Al-Kanz, says most of the 40 to 50 outlets in France that provide halal certification aren&rsquo;t rigorous enough and don&rsquo;t have their own inspectors to verify that Islamic law is being respected.</p>

								<h2>Burger Chain Launches More Halal Outlets in France</h2>
						<p>
							<i>AFP, August 31, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A popular fast-food brand said Tuesday it would extend the number of halal only restaurants in its chain in France, after a controversial pilot project in February proved a success.</p>
<p>Some politicians reacted angrily to Quick&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of its first halal-only branches, saying the chain had deprived non-Muslims of a right to standard burgers and promoted social divisions.</p>
<p>But the Belgian chain said Tuesday it would switch 14 more of its French branches to serve only halal meat, certified as slaughtered in accordance with Islamic practices, bringing the total in France to 22 of its restaurants.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of the results of the experiment in February, we have decided to keep the halal service in the eight test restaurants and to extend it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from September 1,&#8221; said Quick chief executive Jacques-Edouard Charret.</p>
<p>Home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority, estimated at between five and six million, France has seen a series of controversies highlighting tension between the integration of Muslims and the demands of an officially secular state.</p>
<p>The red Quick sign is a common sight in France, as are the golden arches of the US burger chain McDonalds, and both outlets are popular in urban districts with populations of largely immigrant descent.</p>
<p>Charret told a news conference that 10 of the new halal restaurants are in the greater Paris region, including several underprivileged suburbs in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis, north and east of the capital proper.</p>
<p>Halal restaurants will now account for six percent of Quick&rsquo;s branches in mainland France.</p>
<p>The company said that for customers who wished to avoid halal meat, it would offer a non-halal burger that will be prepared elsewhere and heated up on-site.<br>

		<p>You will never be able to make them happy. It will always be something with them.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, it wil never be enough, will be too little too late, etc. Nothing can make them happy.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the more you do, the more and more will be the demands. A never ending stream.</p>
<p>Tell them to start their own burger bars and fast food places that they are satisfied with. Don&rsquo;t try to make them happy, it is not worth the effort. The return for what you put into it is almost a nothing.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct, muslims are never going to be satisfied (no different than American blacks in that respect) until anywhere the fools are is like Saudi or Afghan. Give them an inch and they&rsquo;ll take your head!</p>

		<p>Where exactly in the koran does it talk about the menu of French burger chains? </p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad to see leaders of the Paris mosque positioning themselves as a rival to the Michelin guide. </p>
<p>This is absurd. My advice to unhappy muslim junk food lovers: eat somewhere else. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Pope demanding that Denny&rsquo;s serve only fish on Fridays, &#8220;or else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another tip for French muslims: cook your own food if you don&rsquo;t trust the buns.  </p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that assimilation-integration thing working for your now, Nicolas?</p>

<p>Let me get this straight. If you&rsquo;re French, and want to buy a Quick burger in France, you don&rsquo;t get a fresh one, but a pre-made frozen one that is heated in a microwave.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only entitled to a fresh one if you&rsquo;re a Muslim that probably hates France and the French anyhow. Maybe Quick can staff their stores with the poor, disaffected Muslim youth that riot every year, now that their halal&hellip;.</p>
<p>This can&rsquo;t go on much longer.</p>

		<p>I agree with what some have said about Muslims never being satisfied. Everytime they have their demands met, they&rsquo;re never pleased. It&rsquo;s always one insatiable demand after another.</p>
<p>When are these countries going to wake up and see how much of a threat Muslims really are? It&rsquo;s not &#8220;racist&#8221; to stand up against Muslims, it&rsquo;s courageous! They deserve nothing but disdain.</p>

<p>I love a good piece of fried chicken now and then when I&rsquo;m away from home.  I have tried KCF in France several times. I must say, despite the French reputation for food, they just don&rsquo;t do fried chicken right. Col. Sanders would cry&hellip;.  (maybe because it&rsquo;s hallal? - which I didn&rsquo;t realize).</p>
<p>But I must say that the places were PACKED! All with Africans, not Frenchmen, black Africans at that.  They obviously adore it.</p>
<p>As for burgers at Quick, I&rsquo;ve never tried one. If you get a burger in France, it&rsquo;s likely to be horsemeat. McDonald&rsquo;s emphasizes pure beef,  but Quick leaves it unspecified. (I doubt that it would matter to Arabs or Africans, to whom meat is meat.)</p>
