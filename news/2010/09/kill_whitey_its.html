			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Dobbs, Wired Science, September 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A couple years ago, David Pizarro, a young research psychologist at Cornell, brewed up a devious variation on the classic trolley problem. The trolley problem is that staple of moral psychology studies at dinner parties in which you ask someone to decide under what conditions it&rsquo;s morally permissible to kill one person to save others. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This has generated scores of studies that pose all kinds of variations. (You can take a version of the test yourself at Should You Kill the Fat Man?) Perhaps the richest has been the footbridge problem. {snip} You&rsquo;re on a footbridge over the trolley track, and next to you, leaning perilously over the rail to see what happens, stands a very large man  &mdash;  a man large enough, in fact, to stop the train [which is running out of control]. Is it moral to push the guy over the rail to stop the train?</p>
<p>Researchers generally use these scenarios to see whether people hold a) an absolutist or so-called &#8220;deontological&#8221; moral code or b) a utilitarian or &#8220;consequentialist&#8221; moral code. In an absolutist code, an act&rsquo;s morality virtually never depends on context or secondary consequences. A utilitarian code allows that an act&rsquo;s morality can depend on context and secondary consequences, such as whether taking one life can save two or three or a thousand. In most studies, people start out insisting they have absolute codes.</p>
<p>But when researchers tweak the settings, many people decide it&rsquo;s relative after all: Say the man is known to be dying, or was contemplating jumping off the bridge anyway  &mdash;  and the passengers are all children  &mdash;  and for some people, that makes it different. Or the guy is a murderer and the passengers nuns. In other scenarios the man might be slipping, and will fall and die if you don&rsquo;t grab him: Do you save him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even if it means all those kids will die? By tweaking these settings, researchers can squeeze an absolutist pretty hard, but they usually find a mix of absolutists and consequentialists.</p>
<p>As a grad student, Pizarro liked trolleyology. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} He suspected we might be more fickle. That perhaps we act first and scramble for morality afterward, or something along those lines, and that we choose our rule set according to how well it fits our desires.</p>
<p>To test this, he and some colleagues devised some mischievous variations on the footbridge problem. {snip}</p>
<p>As Pizarro describes, the variations are all of a piece: All explore how the political and racial prejudices  &mdash;  and guilt  &mdash;  of both liberals and conservatives might affect where they stand on the absolutist-consequentialist spectrum.</p>
<p>Perhaps most revealing is what Pizarro calls the &#8220;Kill Whitey&#8221; study. This was a footbridge problem  &mdash;  two variations on a footbridge problem in one, actually  &mdash;  that the team presented to 238 California undergrads. The undergrads were of mixed race, ethnicity and political leanings. Before they faced the problem, 87 percent of them said they did not consider race or nationality a relevant factor in moral decisions. {snip}</p>
<p>    Participants received one of two scenarios involving an individual who has to decide whether or not to throw a large man in the path of a trolley (described as large enough that he would stop the progress of the trolley) in order to prevent the trolley from killing 100 innocent individual strapped in a bus.</p>
<p>    Half of the participants received a version of the scenario where the agent could choose to sacrifice an individual named &#8220;Tyrone Payton&#8221; to save 100 members of the New York Philharmonic, and the other half received a version where the agent could choose to sacrifice &#8220;Chip Ellsworth III&#8221; to save 100 members of the Harlem Jazz Orchestra. In both scenarios the individual decides to throw the person onto the trolley tracks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the guy on the bridge kills either Tyrone to save the New York Philharmonic or Chip to save the Harlem Jazz Orchestra. {snip}</p>
<p>Turned out the racial identities did indeed, ah, color peoples&rsquo; judgments, but it colored them differently depending on their political bent. Pizarro, who describes himself as a person who &#8220;would probably be graded a liberal on tests,&#8221; roughly expected that liberals would be more consistent. Yet liberals proved just as prejudiced here as conservatives were, but in reverse: While self-described conservatives more readily accepted the sacrifice of Tyrone than they did killing Chip, the liberals were easier about seeing Chip sacrificed than Tyrone.</p>
<p>But this was just college students. Perhaps they were morally mushier than most people. So the team went further afield. As Pizarro describes in the talk:<blockquote>We wanted to find a sample of more sort of, you know, real people. So we went in Orange County out to a mall and we got people who are actually Republicans and actually Democrats, not wishy-washy college students. The effect just got stronger. (This time it was using a &#8220;lifeboat&#8221; dilemma where one person has to be thrown off the edge of a lifeboat in order to save everybody, again using the names &#8220;Tyrone Payton&#8221; or &#8220;Chip Ellsworth III&#8221;.) We replicated the finding, but this time it was even stronger.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering whether this is just because conservatives are racist  &mdash;  well, it may well be that conservatives are more racist. But it appears in these studies that the effect is driven [primarily] by liberals saying that they&rsquo;re more likely to agree with pushing the white man and [more likely to] disagree with pushing the black man.</p>
<p>So we used to refer to this as the &#8220;kill whitey&#8221; study.<br>
</blockquote>They offered some other scenarios too, about collateral damage in military situations, for instance, and found similar differences: Conservatives accepted collateral damage more easily if the dead were Iraqis than if they were Americans, while liberals accepted civilian deaths more readily if the dead were Americans rather than Iraqis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Or as Pizarro told me on the phone, &#8220;The idea is not that people are or are not utilitarian; it&rsquo;s that they will cite being utilitarian when it behooves them. People are aren&rsquo;t using these principles and then applying them. They arrive at a judgment and seek a principle.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since JFK, Americans have voted for leaders who put the rights of the unproductive,African descendents, Latin illegals, and Hollywood decadents first. Americans knew this. They keep on cutting their own throats. Education declines, music is coarse, the arts in the sense of traditional beauty are dead, and sexual gratification trumps everything. Americans deserve what they have: a broke,debt-ridden nation. Rome was in better shape than America in its dying stages: At least Byzantium carried on for a while,and medieval society eventually restored some of the core principles of the West. We don&rsquo;t even know what questions to ask any more, let alone generate answers. Survival is the core element of every species. It means nothing to reality show TV, virtual reality America.</p>

		<p>I need to get this off my chest.</p>
<p>10 years ago as a substitute teacher in California, I was left with a &#8220;who gets thrown off the lifeboat&#8221; problem for the class to discuss.</p>
<p>The class, about 70% hispanic and black, overwhelmingly decided that the rich white 8 year old girl should be the first to go because she was characterized as spoiled.</p>
<p>No matter how I tried to reason with them, they insisted that the little white girl should die.</p>

<p>Of course he did, we live in a society that constantly tells us liberals are right. Notice, though the implication may be there, the study can&rsquo;t come out and say &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; did better on the test than liberals. They just did different. As opposed to most studies which set out to prove that whites, and only whites, are racist. That&rsquo;s seemingly all research ever sets out to uncover. Nothing else matters&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one problem with the test, however. We live in a liberal society. Most likely most of the participants are lying. This test is meaningless. It would take a real event before we see what participants would actually do.</p>

<p>Well, I guess if this study proves anything, it is that &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; or as I like to call them Reds, are exactly what we on the &ldquo;racist right&rdquo; have always known them to be: traitors with an alien ideology and a perverted lust for a white genocide. Trust me, as far as these sub-vile Reds are concerned, the feeling is more than reciprocated on my part!</p>
<p>However, I digress.</p>
<p>The real issue here (by extrapolation, as is so often used in interpreting behavioral science research results&lsquo; ramifications) is that &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; are an abnormal pack of degenerates, who value others over their own, up to and including their own children. They seem to have an unnatural knack for the freakish and hideous when it comes to commonsense and survival; this is particularly true, when one considers their sanctimonious deftness at taking such concepts as freedom or tolerance, and twisting them into the exact opposites of their definitions, both in rhetoric and reality. </p>
<p>In the end, it is comforting to call this &ldquo;stupidity,&rdquo; or worse &ldquo;well intentioned ignorance.&rdquo; However, it is neither of these, for what fool or uneducated individual could concoct so monstrous a thing as multiculturalism? Quite the contrary, with their suicidal diversity raptures and irrational utopian Marxist fantasies, these people are clearly mentally ill, as any cognitive process that celebrates death and destruction must be indicative of. It is the worst form of mental illness, since in destroying the mind, it also rots the soul into seeing evil as &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and it cannot be cured with a pill or therapy. </p>

		<p>Yup, liberals are the enemy. </p>
<p>Now what is the benefit to themselves, and/or the societies they inhabit, for their kind of behavior/attitude?  Or is it merely an aberration that hasn&rsquo;t been cleaned out of the pool. I can understand the tension between co-operation and competition but not recognizing your own??  And if you don&rsquo;t recognize your own, how can any other group accept you, seeing as how you&rsquo;ve abandoned one already?</p>

<p>That white liberals have accepted the notion that white people are uniquely guilty of most, if not all, of histories &#8216;crimes against humanity&rsquo; and must be sacrificed or even eliminated for the sake of humanity, is a troubling and dangerous precedent.</p>
<p><b>&rdquo;The truth is that Mozart, Pascal, Boolean algebra, Shakespeare, parliamentary government, baroque churches, Newton, the emancipation of women, Kant, Marx, and Balanchine ballets don&rsquo;t redeem what this particular civilization has wrought upon the world. The white race is the cancer of human history. Susan Sontag&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Liberalism is a mental illness characterized by an inability to see reality. That Ms. Sontag and liberals would gleefully throw the white man onto the train tracks and few people acknowledge and grasp the resolve of this mindset only means that white genocide is considered a noble and both absolute and utilitarian option for many.<br>

<p>To add something to what I just wrote above and in relation to this finding, it is a cold comfort to see that no matter what the long term outcomes, &ldquo;right wing racist&rdquo; are in a no lose position both philosophically and practicably. If we succeed, if we wake up the country or better still the entire white world, we survive and dominate cultural and technological progress. If we do not and subsequently go extinct instead, then a sub-Dark Age is entered and progress not only slows, but most likely ends. This is what &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; miss; that is at least, until they are personally exposed to nonwhite pillage and rape. At that point, with their fragile ego driven psychologies forces most of them toward reality and sanity.</p>
<p>I say most, since the more hopelessly deranged in their cadre, derive a sense of absolution and sanctity from such brutality being visited upon them. Hence, Western &ldquo;journalists&rdquo; that find succor in being gang raped by Muslim terrorist gangs, or white parents that make a fetish of groveling apology to the nonwhite killers of their children, such as happened with the case of &ldquo;saint&rdquo; Amy Biehl.</p>

		<p>On the lighter side. The trick in these scenarios is you are set up the moment you agree to make a decision because the question has locked you into making a &#8220;moral&#8221; decision. You fall for it because you see your self as a &#8220;moral&#8221; person. Instead view the situation as simply one where you are not obligated to make any decision whatsoever any more than god is obligated to intervene.  As we know he lets free will operate without restriction as to consequences. For example he certainly won&rsquo;t sober up the train engineer about to crash the train if such were the case.  Starting from that basis you can simply let the train crash no matter how horrific with no guilt whatoever since you clearly have no more obligation than god.    Next if you have any reason, race or otherwise, to not like the person on the bridge you can chuck him off with no fear of prosecution because you will  have prevented the greater harm. Or if you like the people on the train you can save them for that reason alone without consequence to yourself. Therefore it is simply  a rare opportunity to exert tremendous power and influence by making whatever decision pleases you without any consequences. What&rsquo;s the problem, huh?</p>

		<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;ve always wondered what motivates white elite liberals.</p>
<p>If I had to choose between an American or an Iraqi, I choose the American because he has paid taxes to support me, helped fight to defend me, just as I would for him. This is the healthy behavior of any society. I would expect an Iraqi man to choose his people over me for the same reasons. Of course it&rsquo;s never this simple in real life.</p>
<p>But here we have these liberals who choose the foreigner who has done nothing for our country over the native who has made countless sacrifices for them. They are traitors, yes, but how does this benefit them?  It seems like they lose out too. </p>

		<p>Read the comments section on any major news website and you&rsquo;ll see the same thing, no study required.  Liberal Whites engage in daily self-flagellation and only need a mirror to practice their Two Minutes Hate.</p>
<p>So when Americans who are conservative would prefer to see Americans survive over Iraqis, while liberal Americans prefer the opposite, which group is the one who&rsquo;s thought process is malfunctioning, when it&rsquo;s human nature to favor the group to which one belongs?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me though from people who crusade against child abuse during the day and get abortions in the afternoon, then accuse me of being overly emotional as an expectant father when I talk about how sick it makes me that people kill their unborn.</p>

		<p>All of these &#8220;studies&#8221; are hypotheticals.  People aren&rsquo;t actually pushing someone off a footbridge onto the tracks of an oncoming trolley.</p>
<p>What people do and what they say they will do are often two different matters entirely. Moreover, the scenarios are never real world scenarios, but are just fantasies put onto paper. (Ask yourself how likely would you be at the bridge at the right moment? Or how could you tell that the trolley was out of control versus running fast?  Or what makes you think that a person, even a fat one, would stop it or prevent it from causing an accident? But, I digress, since to ask these questions is to buy into the game, which is all that this type of &#8220;research&#8221; is. It&rsquo;s nothing more than that, a game. It is not science.)</p>
<p>And yet, in the real world, real world problems exist, and I guess these &#8220;researchers&#8221; at Cornell would rather delve into fantasyland than study something real.  Well, Cornell&rsquo;s a private school and formerly a good one, and I hope that no tax dollars went to pay for this &#8220;research.&#8221;<br>

		<p>One thing is crystal clear from these studies, and that is that Liberals, even though most of them are White, hate Whites.  They&rsquo;re self-hating and are more likely to destroy themselves and other Whites for the sake of any other race, creed, or color.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pathology.</p>

		<p>This just shows how stupid these people are. After all, they depend on the white man to take care of them. As you can see around the world, the worst thing that can happen to black people is to have to rely upon one another.<br>

		<p>I clearly remember an NFL game where a black offensive lineman was standing over 2 players on the ground-one was his White teammate and the other a black opponent. He paused briefly, then extended his hand to the black defender and helped him up. This, to me, spoke volumnes about him and his &#8220;brothers&#8221;. <br>

		<p>Apparently, the study didn&rsquo;t separate thoughts from actions. The study should have (1) asked the interviewee what he thought was the right thing to do, and then (2) asked him what he thought he would actually do if placed in that actual situation. For instance, while I might agree that sacrificing one (hopefully &#8220;useless&#8221;) person for the greater good would be the right thing to do, I know that I could never do it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8221;Yup, liberals are the enemy. &#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm certainly liberals are but we have to define who/what is and isn&rsquo;t liberal. Most mainstream &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; and many who vote in their support are also very liberal cepting perhaps certain fiscal issues. Cultural Marxism has permeated our national institutions from head to toe. There is NOT ONE Republican who will stand up in specific support of us. While many stand in support either explicitly or implicitly of all kinds of anti white groups, laws and polices.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t everybody know this? White liberals promote affirmative action against lower and working class whites. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they sacrifice the life of a white person to save precious blacks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of blacks were in this study on the liberal side. Given the amount of racial murder they commit this result can hardly be surprising to anyone who reads amren.com.</p>

		<p>So many things here&hellip;</p>
<p>First off, there are too many variables being assigned, associated and outcome tested for and not enough group variations to make the results statistically valid.</p>
<p>If you use white and black names, you have to use white and black test groups, each racial test group split 50:50 with each scenario.  That&rsquo;s four groups.  If you further subdivide for political bias within the races, you have to have conservative whites and blacks looking at Chip and Tyrone, equally.  Ditto liberal white and blacks doing the same.  That&rsquo;s 16 groups.  You should probably also include a &#8216;control&rsquo; group of hispanic or asians to help weight with.  Thats 20+.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have just two groups representing all four factors of race and political leaning with such biased scenarios without creating a race-baiting scenario.</p>
<p>Nor can each group take one test after the other or answer both questions at once.  Because that will lead to gaming psychologies.</p>
<p>If you want to &#8216;deontologicalize&rsquo; the scenario, you should also remove all labels which could be considered biased.  Which means it cannot be a trolley, much less an orchestra, it has to be something which both groups feel equally threatened by.  Like a lion or an avalanche.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to give null-vote or &#8216;spoiling&rsquo; options.  Do you let the lion eat Chip or do you yell a warning so that another member of the pride sees and kills you?  What about the ten other people on the safari that don&rsquo;t know how to get back?</p>
<p>Or do you throw Tyrone a rope knowing that if you do another section of the snowslide which washed him over the cliff will come down on you?  What about the ten elderly people (race not specified) tied to your line?</p>
<p>As to liberals being sickos, let&rsquo;s just say that they are instead innocents driven by genetics.  Social evolutionists have long known that whites get along for the principle reason that we believe in selfish and social altruism.  i.e.  What&rsquo;s good for you may be good for me, even if it overrides my genetic legacy by getting me killed IF, in the long run, it effectively enhances the group survival percentages for my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you do something for the group that results in their benefit, you may rise in their ranks, even as an outsider.  Thereby in fact enhancing your ability to create gene flow between groups, whether as conqueror or innovator.</p>
<p>Now imagine that, to make these &#8216;fierce innovators&rsquo; truly welcome in a society, there are &#8216;intergroup accomodators&rsquo; whose life role, often as rebels, is to mediate trouble and negotiate for both sides with an eye to improving -their- mating prospects by betting on the darkhorse.  The bad boy.  The new blood.</p>
<p>If they can enable that outsider, to add his genes to the group, then they rise on his benefit/dominance as well.</p>
<p>Anyone who inhibits or denies this attempt to assimilate and personally benefit from intergroup mixing is fighting a deep genetic instinct as they effectively deny that traitorous personality the social role for which their genes optimized their brains.</p>
<p>Obviously, if this person is female, no matter what else happens they can breed the genes into the group, assuming the group doesn&rsquo;t deny her and her children social privileges.  But this is only a passive act which still does not empower that individual.  If she undercuts the existing powerbase AND breeds it&rsquo;s replacement then she is able to rise herself based on the accession of her offspring and mate.  Assuring that both will be successful.  Empathy in this case can be supremely successful because it is _ultimately selfish_.</p>
<p>In this, it is important to note that an intergroup accomodator doesn&rsquo;t gain much by actively aiding their own, because that is seen as &#8216;normal&rsquo; behavior by the dominant, conservative and often male leadership.  Only by allying to outside threats do they gain affirmation and acknowledgement.  Even if it is negative, fear based, resentment from the racial parent group itself.</p>
<p>Until and unless we stop demonizing liberals as &#8216;the mentally ill&rsquo; and start realizing that they are acting with the viciousness and power of genetic instinct driven behaviors, we will never be able to effectively, with compassion, rechannel their actions back towards in-group driven altruism.</p>
<p>Right now, liberals run roughshod over our national policies because they are acting like unsupervised children, on instinct, without volitional willingness to acknowledge or perhaps even cognitive ability to understand some complex and hard to grasp facts about the genetic potentials of intelligence and social conformity between groups.</p>
<p>Much like blacks and hispanics themselves.</p>
<p>Specifically, this is the fact that whites and some asians are the only people to have a sense of social altruism rather than the group entitlement/dominance that all the tribal cultures of the world bring with them as Darwinistic selective legacy.</p>
<p>In particular, it is important to de-victimize those that intergroup accomodators attempt to ally with because, like children, they resent the dominance of and feel alienated by the very group/social system which created them and so ally with the new and strange based on a feeling of co-oppression.</p>
<p>If you make the outsider into a brutal threat that dominates the IA personality as soon as they are themselves empowered, liberal accomodators will rapidly see that the world is the same whereever you go, whomever you empower by support, and begin to accept that instinctive altruism as selfish empathy is not the means to proper government or sustainment of society.</p>
<p>But we shouldn&rsquo;t wait until it all falls apart just to teach them a lesson.  Thats a nose cutting to spite our own faces.  Even as, displaced by other racial groups, we will have nothing left to offer to bring them back into our own group.  And thus (as females) to assure our genetic legacy through their wombs.</p>
<p>Feminism and Liberalism are closely tied.  But they are also essentially self destructive in their willfulness as a lack of rational balance.  And it is the failure to realize this which ultimately makes them so dangerous.</p>

		<p>Liberalism is a mental disorder.  I was speaking with my lefty loon friend the other day and related to me how it made him feel &#8220;good&#8221; that he was in the post office with muslim women in headscarves.  This is a guy that rails about Christianity and its confines.  </p>
<p>I think there is a reflexive action to go against the perceived mainstream rooted in some dark place in the mind of liberals.  They live in the world of &#8220;the world should be&#8221; and pretend that it is so.  </p>

		<p>Liberal altruism is an evolutionary adaptation that worked very well during times when whites only dealt with other whites.  There are many other examples of an evolutionary adaptation that was advantageous at one point but then turns sour when the circumstances change.</p>
<p>I am willing to believe and indeed, it accords with my personal experience, that many liberals are very good hearted people&hellip; in neolithic and archaic white hunter gatherer society their altruism would have been very beneficial to the development of white progression and cooperation.</p>
<p>But now?  That&rsquo;s the problem.  These same types of people are incapable of seeing that their traits are perverse in a multi racial world because the races are not the same.  It&rsquo;s a wasps and bees scenario.</p>
<p>This is the main problem&hellip; the key is to show that the main racial differences black/everything else, exist.</p>
<p>There needs to be a sea change in this attitude or the liberal altruistic ethos will continue to prevail until we sink to the level of the blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a once advantageous evolutionary adaptation now inappropriate to the situation.</p>

		<p>People are quick to blame &#8220;the liberals&#8221; and contribute findings like this in terms of who the enemies of whites are (ie which whites should be lumped in with non-whites as racial enemies).  Many more are willing to describe liberalism as a &#8220;mental disorder&#8221; as if what is wrong with these people is intrinsic to whom they are&hellip;.or simply just treason.</p>
<p>Consider this.  One cannot turn on a television for five minutes without seeing sophisticated brain washing techniques that often have a blatantly anti-white message.  The tsunami of this brainwashing is both relentless and insidious.  And quite sophisticated&hellip;.evolving over time.  And TV is just one of the sources we all come into contact with every day.</p>
<p>I propose that the ONLY difference between a liberal and a conservative, a communist and a white nationalist, is that person&rsquo;s innate resistance to brain washing.  Further, resistance is not immunity.  You might want to think about that, CAREFULLY, when noticing that others are brainwashed.  They don&rsquo;t know it.  And neither do you.  A big part of doing something about this is first noticing it in yourself and dismantling attitudes, philosophies and beliefs (not to mention behaviors) that were put there by someone else.  You won&rsquo;t like the amount you find.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer is a technique as old as warfare itself.  And part of the point of this brainwashing is divide and conquer.  Bother liberals and others run a continuum from, that &#8220;evil person&#8221; should dangle with the rest of them on the &#8220;day of rope&#8221; (made infamous by the Turner Diaries) to well, they will just all suffer when society collapses/our side takes over.  I have my canned foods, and well oiled guns ready.</p>
<p>That is exactly the wrong attitude to have.  Or rather it&rsquo;s something someone else wants to program into you&hellip;.divide and conquer.  Instead, concern yourself with the brainwashing and how to break it off of yourself and others.  Eventually, one particularly smart person will figure out how to break it off for large groups of people at a time.</p>
<p>Then the real fun will begin.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Guilty white libs care more about a downtrodden group overseas than poor whites across town&#8221;</p>
<p>I fear that&rsquo;s not completely true. A white lib cares more about the person standing beside him. More so than the poor whites living across town and more so than the downtrodden overseas. The motivation is about making the person beside him feel bad, and not so much about their good-thoughts &#8216;helping&rsquo; folks a world away. To change society we would need to change the way punishment and reward are handed out. Surely libs would be the first to follow. But this message board is really about the (long neglected?) question of what is or isn&rsquo;t best for whites. Someone should at least be asking that question. So I suppose, to a certain degree we should be politically neutral, or at least encourage liberals to join us in this endeavor. </p>

		<p>This is what I have noticed in the schools among my black &#8216;colleagues&rsquo;:</p>
<p>Blacks, often at each other&rsquo;s throats in the most vile, accusatory manner possible, will actively seek out White teachers like me to take their side against a black opponent.</p>
<p>Yet those same black teachers, mortal enemies only a few moments before, will instantly band together in any situation against any White.  Always.  That black teacher who considered you his &#8216;friend&rsquo; when he needed your help will never support you in any manner.  And, don&rsquo;t count on Whites to come to your defense either (except behind closed doors).  They won&rsquo;t risk their reputation or career for the likes of you and, in fact, are more likely to support blacks over you in a dispute. </p>
<p>I have never known it to be any other way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that Whites will not only not support one another but often support blacks over Whites while blacks support only one another, always, even to the point of lying.</p>

<p>I noticed on this thread a lot of posters claiming that &#8216;Liberals are Mentally Ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hardly.</p>
<p>What may appear to be mental illness to you is not. Lefties&rsquo; Primary Directive  &mdash;   Destruction Of Whites, White Americans and White Civilization, is construed as mental illness because it is so unbelievable, so fantastic and so unimaginable that it can&rsquo;t be possible true.  </p>
<p>The displacement and destruction of White America, couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been planned out could it?</p>
<p>No one would do this on purpose&hellip;would he?</p>
<p>Who on earth would want the destruction of the White race?  The race that gave us Western Civilization, that which has gifted the world with advanced technology, medical breakthroughs, rational explanations of nature, financial systems that work  &mdash;  a civilization that has made life longer, easier and healthier For All Mankind Everywhere. </p>
<p>Who would wish genocide on this race of people?</p>
<p>Plenty, as it turns out.</p>
<p>The Destruction of American White Civilization is a carefully detailed, rational, triangulated plan (involving the media, government and academia) put in motion 50 years ago to bring about the downfall of White America.  </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working, brilliantly, exactly as intended.</p>
<p>Call them anything you wish, but do not call them mentally ill.</p>

Using Susan Sontag as an example of a <i>white</i> liberal is stretching it. You americans do not understand the difference between caucasian and white. Susan Sontag merely acted in ethnic self interest and I find nothing controversial or for that matter new in her statement. </p>
<p>A better example of a white liberal traitor would be Al Gore, who happily sells out his own countrymen for a buck - Al Gore owns shares in companies that would benefit greatly from carbon trade legislation. Or any of the white liberals who happily supports civil rights causes yet move away when the first black family moves in. The numbers of white liberal traitors are endless. </p>

_____________________</p>
<p>I agree with you. It&rsquo;s an exercise in masochism. That applies to  the true zealots.  For all the others, the self-serving opportunists who just go along but profit from it, they sacrifice the benefits of OTHERS, but not their own. They, the latter, are the ones who will go with whatever is the winning team, according to how the wind is blowing.</p>
<p>But I wonder if the liberalism you describe  (actually extreme left-wingism) could be a combination of both a religious mania AND a personal mental disorder. After all, many religious zealots are already mentally disordered people.  (Just look, for example,  at that Storro woman in Washington, who threw acid in her own face in order to get on television and &#8220;tell people about Jesus&#8221;.) For such people, I suspect it doesn&rsquo;t really matter very much what particular &#8220;god&#8221; they worship. Multiculturalism, or any other fashionable cause will do. They just need a cause that&rsquo;s larger than themselves, a cause that makes them feel important and think they&rsquo;re doing God&rsquo;s work.  It&rsquo;s what gives meaning to their otherwise empty, twisted  lives.  </p>
<p>They can be very dangerous people. Carried to an extreme, it produces fanatics who fly airliners into skyscrapers&hellip; because they are on a heavenly mission, carrying out God&rsquo;s plan. They know what&rsquo;s best for the rest of us   &mdash;   even if it&rsquo;s death.</p>
