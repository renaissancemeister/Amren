<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MOVIE fan Martin Smith landed in court on a racism charge after he downloaded part of the soundtrack from the 1980s comedy film Rita, Sue and Bob Too! and installed it as a ringtone on his mobile.</p>
<p>Martin, of Holmewood, north Derbyshire, claims friends and workmates got used to hearing the voice of an Asian actor reciting the words &#8220;I can&rsquo;t help being a Paki .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;.</p>
<p>But a woman from a mixed race family wasn&rsquo;t amused when Martin&rsquo;s Nokia went off as she queued alongside him at a village shop.</p>
<p>Over-hearing the clip from the movie  &mdash;  which chronicles the exploits of two schoolgirls growing up on a rundown estate in Bradford  &mdash;  the woman went home and lodged a formal complaint with the police.</p>
<p>Officers arrested the 36-year-old at home two days later and locked him in the cells at Chesterfield for four hours before charging him with contravening race relation laws.</p>
<p>Angry warehouseman Martin hit out after magistrates fined him £191 with £85 costs for using racially aggravated threatening or insulting words or behaviour.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Arresting me was a total over-reaction  &mdash;  surely the police have better things to do with their time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Channel 4 can put Rita, Sue and Bob Too! on TV all the time, as it does, then why can&rsquo;t I play a clip from the soundtrack on my phone?</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s good enough for prime time TV then it ought to be good enough for me and my mobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ringtone wouldn&rsquo;t have suited everybody, but the film&rsquo;s my all time favourite. I&rsquo;ve seen it 15 or 20 times and I should be able to download what I want without the police hauling me off to the cells and calling me a racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve had the ringtone for a year and nobody&rsquo;s ever complained. All my friends and workmates thought it was hilarious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of Asian friends, who&rsquo;ve seen the film and they thought it was really funny as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded if the police had taken me to the station and told me to get it changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get on really well with Asian people and the last thing I wanted to do was upset anyone. I just did it for a bit of fun because I love the film so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll not be taking any chances with the ringtone in future though. I&rsquo;ll be sticking to plinky plonky music like everyone else from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court was told the unnamed woman, who was from a mixed African-Mediterranean background, overheard the ringtone while she was waiting to be served at the grocery store near Smith&rsquo;s home in Holmewood.</p>
<p>Jon Barber, defending, said his client denied making a racist remark in front of the complainant, but accepted the woman may have been offended by the ringtone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought it was amusing  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s a lesson learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Geoff Wallage said the woman had made no complaint to his staff at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very sorry for Martin, he&rsquo;s a really decent bloke with a great sense of humour and he didn&rsquo;t deserve all this trouble. I feel that it&rsquo;s been a complete waste of public money. They should have told Martin to swap his ringtone and left it at that, instead of dragging him to court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve got a Pakistani accountant and he couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I explained what had happened. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&#8221;<br>

<p>He loses the argument at:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of Asian friends, who&rsquo;ve seen the film and they thought it was really funny as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Typical White person who tries to prove how anti raciss he is by having a truly and wonderfully Diverse group of friends.  That&rsquo;s the first signal to the Diversity Curse that he is an easy mark and will accept any and all harassment without putting up a real fight.  By showcasing Diversity, he proves that he won&rsquo;t fight for his race, which sends message that when attacked for racism, the only honorable thing to do in never fight back, but give in, give up, and go away back to some hell hole neighborhood surrounded by &#8220;the other&#8221; and keep your mouth shut forever.<br>

		<p>I guess the British still haven&rsquo;t caught on to the whole &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; thing. Helps me understand better why we revolted against their government all those years ago.</p>
<p>In America, even under Obama&rsquo;s regime, the police telling a man to CHANGE HIS RINGTONE, for any reason, is completely unheard of. I just hope that our new Civil Rights gestapo (the guy who said he will greatly expanding hate crime legislation and all that; I can&rsquo;t remember his name) doesn&rsquo;t change this.</p>

		<p>Another in a long list of examples of how freedom of speech and expression are myths in the UK (and the EU).  There was also something sad and pathetic about Martin Smith having to &#8216;prove&rsquo; he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Face it: the English are now strangers in the land of their forefathers, at the mercy of the black and brown hordes that have inundated it.</p>

		<p>And I thought thought control was bad in the US&hellip;</p>
<p>Notice that the accused didn&rsquo;t even have the right to face his accuser. If anyone was using &#8220;racially aggravated threatening or insulting words or behaviour&#8221; it was the unnamed woman who reported him.</p>
<p>And notice how everybody quoted in this story was quick to insist not that freedom of speech and freedom of thought are under assault, but simply that they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racist,&#8221; using a variation of the old American line, &#8220;Some of my best friends are black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am absolutely flabbergasted by this story.  He&rsquo;s arrested because a stranger was offended by his ringtone? Would she be arrested if the ringtone on her phone was the Islamic call to prayer? Unbelievable.  I&rsquo;m wondering how soon this degree of idiotic thought policing will be enacted in the USA.</p>

<p>Soon the left and then most of the popular TV shows will take up a position that, saying that the phrase, &#8220;some of my best friends are black&#8221; is a sure sign of racism, against blacks.</p>

<p><br>
Yes, I noticed. I noticed the groveling, the frightened backing down.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; has obviously become the new equivalent of the old term &#8220;heretic&#8221;&hellip; the most horrible and dangerous thing you could be accused of, once upon a time.  They don&rsquo;t burn you at the stake anymore, but you are crucified professionally and personally in every other way and nobody will want to know you. You are considered contaminated. You are ostracized. </p>
<p>It seems the religious wars are not over.   &mdash;   In modern Europe, they have just taken a new twist.   A racist is the worst demon in the new state religion of Diversity and Equality. A racist, by definition, implicitly contradicts the basic tenets of the new religion, and so all racists have to go. They are a threat to the state.  They are the new witches and heretics, and will be dealt with appropriately.</p>
