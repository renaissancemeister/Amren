<h1>Teen Substance Use Seems to Differ by Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>HealthDay, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new California survey suggests that Hispanic middle-school students are more likely to smoke, drink and use marijuana than other kids their age, while Asians are the least likely to experiment with these substances.</p>
<p>Researchers studied 5,500 seventh- and eighth-graders at 16 schools in California. More than one-fifth of the students said they&rsquo;d consumed alcohol, while 10 percent said they&rsquo;d smoked and 7 percent reported smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>About one in four Hispanics said they&rsquo;d consumed alcohol, compared to 21 percent of blacks, 18 percent of whites and just below 10 percent of Asians. The higher rates for Hispanics and lower rates for Asians held up even when researchers adjusted their figures for factors such as gender.</p>
<p>The study is published in the September issue of the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.</p>

		<p>Those two drugs, when used in moderation, aren&rsquo;t exactly what I call terrible when they are used by adults.</p>
<p>The problem this article points out though is that the users are quite young.</p>

		<p>White dysfunction.  Life is hard enough without addictions but many people including white people want to make it even harder.  There are many shows on TV now showcasing white dysfunction from drug addiction to hoarding to obesity.  This is another reason why white students underperform in school because they are burdened by people around them or themselves with addictions.  I looked at statistics a couple months ago of drug treatment facilities and saw how bad drug addiction is among white people.  Although I doubt the sample was represenative of the population at large because of the expense of these facilities it did show that white people seeking help for most of the drugs listed peaked between the ages of 18-25 and for black people 38-45.   Black people either have a long run of addiction before seeking help or become addicted later in life.  The statistics for Latinos were varied and for Asian low across the board.</p>

		<p>Surveys like this are pretty useless. They only report what people SAY they do, not what they ACTUALLY do. And, of course, they can be rigged by selecting certain populations to survey.</p>
<p>Using such surveys, the National Institute of Drug Abuse claims that white high school students are bigger drug users than all other ethnic groups (blacks, hispanics, asians) except native american.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of whites who thought drugs made them cool. And I&rsquo;m not just talking about poor whites, either. Rich whites probably use them even more. That foolishness disgusts me.</p>

		<p>Most Asian cultures frown very highly upon putting your laundry out in public; seeking counseling services, group therapy, and even drug treatment are things that could put the laundry in view of others. </p>
<p>Heroin is back in a big way where I am at. White, Black, Asian, Mexican its up across the board. My wife is a counselor at a drug treatment, and rape crisis center. The news talks about methamphetamine, but is heroin, and alcohol that 90% of the people are there for. </p>

		<p>Yeah, BlueBlood&hellip;youre right. This meth is destroying Our People, Our Culture, Our Identity.</p>
<p>I dabbled with that trash at a period in my life, years ago. Never again. I preach and teach to other Brothers and Sisters about what it does to Our People.</p>
<p>That drug meth is something right out of the pits of hell.</p>
<p>Whites on meth is like blacks on crack.</p>
<p>Course I have nothing to say about marijuana and alcohol&hellip;.except stop prohibition of marijuana.</p>

		<p>I am indifferent on these issues. Neither pot, nor alcohol is particularly bad for you and if you are a reasonable, hard working person you can use both of these substances and be fine.</p>
<p>Most dysfunctional people abuse some substance or another but not all substances users are dysfunctional. For example in my profession, the law, attorneys have extremely high rates of alcohol and drug abuse but are quiet successful.</p>
<p>Dysfunctional people on the otherhand, welfare recipients, criminals and others losers, also have high rates of substance abuse, but would likely be in the same or similar situations regardless of substance use due to their lack of innate work ethic, morality and determination. </p>

		<p>Another illustration of why it&rsquo;s sooooooooooo necessary to replace White Americans with Hispanics.  The Tobacco Industry, those who manufacture and distribute liquor, and the drug lords, all want to import a demographic who will be better customers for their products.</p>
<p>In Mexico, those people have little money with which to purchase booze, cigs, and drugs.  But bring them here, and they have welfare money, money stolen from elderly widows they&rsquo;ve murdered, money from credit cards they&rsquo;ve stolen or opened in other people&rsquo;s names&hellip;. occasionally, even, they have money from doing &#8220;the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I remember my doctor being disturbed by the fact that I and my family do not touch Alcohol.  Apparently, doctors (the dullards who went to Ole Miss, anyway)consider White America&rsquo;s dwindling use of Alcohol to be a disturbing trend.  But then, docs seem to have become tools of powerful interests&hellip;and so I regard their <br/>
&#8216;opinions&rsquo; as little more than reflections of the intent of powerful interests.</p>
<p>Powerful interests do not like White People, anymore, because we aren&rsquo;t the gullible consumers we once were.  They want gullible consumers.</p>
<p>The fact that we generate ALL the wealth in the Western World, seems not to concern them.  They seem incapable of equating the world&rsquo;s current financial contractions with the dwindling percentage of whites in the world.  We must be replaced, ASAP.</p>
