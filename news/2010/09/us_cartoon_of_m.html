			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Frayer, AOL News, Sept. 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An American cartoonist&rsquo;s rendition of the Mexican flag is causing controversy south of the border, where Mexicans say it&rsquo;s offensive to taint their national symbol with images of drug violence. </p>
<p>Political cartoonist Daryl Cagle&rsquo;s drawing, which ran on the front page of several Mexican newspapers this week, shows what&rsquo;s normally a regal-looking eagle at the center of Mexico&rsquo;s flag riddled with bullets and bleeding. It&rsquo;s a reference to the drug wars that have riled Mexico and left more than 28,000 people dead there in less than four years. </p>
<p>&#8220;Editorial cartoonists look for readily recognizable metaphors and that&rsquo;s an obvious one for Mexico,&#8221; Cagle told CNN.</p>
<p>But some Mexicans say they&rsquo;re offended by the cartoon. Like the American flag, Mexico&rsquo;s banner is a national symbol under which many soldiers and civilians have given their lives. They say Cagle overstepped his creative license in this case.<br>
&#8220;It is a shame that a patriotic symbol like our flag, which is so beautiful to me, can be mocked by a stupid cartoonist,&#8221; one angry reader complained to the Mexican newspaper El Universal. &#8220;I think there are many other ways to graphically protest what&rsquo;s happening in our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican Embassy in Washington weighed in on the issue, with a spokesman Ricardo Alday saying Thursday that Mexico &#8220;respects and defends freedom of speech and freedom of expression&#8221; but &#8220;differs&#8221; with Cagle &#8220;on the use he makes of the Mexican flag and the message it conveys.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On his blog, Cagle acknowledged that many people consider his cartoon &#8220;scandalous&#8221; and that it &#8220;struck a nerve with Mexican readers.&#8221; He said he&rsquo;s received some &#8220;interesting, outraged emails&#8221; from readers. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think your idea of bringing the violence in Mexico to light is excellent. Too bad you butchered it along with the Mexican Flag,&#8221; Ramon De Leon wrote on Cagle&rsquo;s blog comments section. &#8220;Laws in Mexico with regards to the use and depiction of the flag are in place to prevent this sort of stuff. Please consider taking it down and issuing an apology to the Mexican American community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cagle has not yet issued any apology, and newspapers continue to reprint his cartoon despite the controversy. The cartoonist also sought to defend his choice of material as a freedom that comes with his profession. </p>
<p>&#8220;National flags are common fodder for editorial cartoonists around the world, so the reaction to this cartoon was surprising to me,&#8221; Cagle wrote. </p>

<p>Mr. Cagle. Please wake up and smell the coffee. These are very proud people. You have insulted their honor and pride. They are so very proud. Do not you realize this? All gringo should realize this. They are very proud and proud of being so proud. </p>

<p>Someone please remind me of the last time &#8220;the Mexican American community&#8221; apologized for Mexican disrespect to the American flag.  I don&rsquo;t suppose Lauren Frayer will be doing any stories on <i>that</i> topic in the near future.<br>

		<p>Mexicans tend to be just a little bit like muzlims in that they are rather thin skinned, very aware of their own short comings. This cartoon is very much spot on, and for that reason it would naturally be considered unbearably offensive to mexicans. If the shoe fits &hellip;</p>

		<p>I used to love Cagle&rsquo;s cartoon website and logged on every few days.  Then, during the last presidential campaign, I became disgusted because Obama was treated with kid gloves in virtually every featured cartoon  &mdash;  obviously because a black could never be subjected to satire.  Now, Cagle will be lucky if Obama doesn&rsquo;t call him stupid and apologize to Calderone for his outrageous behavior.  The eagle may just come home to roost.</p>

		<p>Cagles cartoon depiction of a bullet riddled Mexican flag is on the mark.<br>
Every year the U.S. Navy seizes several tons in illegal narcotics from ships and planes bound to the U.S. from Mexico.<br>
Yet counter drug expeditions have been ongoing for decades.<br>
If Mexicans are angered by one thing depicted by this cartoon its that 90 million American drug users, our politicans, and millions of Mexican drug trafficers refuse to call a spade a spade.</p>

Every time I see a Mexican flag flying in this country, I&rsquo;m offended, and who cares?  Certainly, none of these Mexican invaders care. </p>

To the point of this &hellip; the flag thing? Yeah,  I found it a little offensive. My first reaction was not a giggle or a smirk.</p>
<p>Just like I find burning the American flag offensive.. <br>
Beating up Muslims.. because they are Muslim.<br>
Beating up hispanics..because they THINK they are Mexican.</p>

		<p>So live with it.  The mexicans we have seen in demonstrations about immigration are mobs, and mob rule has nothing to do with fairness and democracy.  We have seen how you treat the American Flag, you have no respect for anything apart from taking from American what you don&rsquo;t deserve.  You&rsquo;re a mob.</p>

		<p>Right.  And how often have Mexicans, here illegaly, BURNED our flag while making outrageous demands?  The cartoonist drew a cartoon of the Mexican flag!  He didn&rsquo;t enter Mexico illegaly, protest, whine, make ridiculous demands and finally BURN the Mexican flag!</p>
<p>Perhaps Ms. Lauren Frayer should put things into perspective before trying to open our eyes to such &#8220;controversy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If I have this straight, they&rsquo;re &#8220;offended&#8221; by the cartoon, but are not offended by the grotesque level of violence that permeates their whole society - violence perpetrated at every level, from Narco-Jefe to the gunmen on the streets to the corrupt police and politicians to the federales and soldiers who join the Zetas - by Mexicans themselves.  Cagle&rsquo;s cartoon does nothing to taint the symbol of their nation that remotely approaches the tainting Mexicans themselves - together with their coke-head and meth-addict enablers north of the border - have done.</p>
<p>Any Mexican with an ounce of self-respect would insist that their flag be changed, once the dust settles after this lunatic narcotics bings ends.  Germans, it should be remembered at least had the decency to use a completely different flag when they were occupied with their 1933-1945 orgy of national self-degredation.  While we&rsquo;re on the subject, I think a return to the Gadsen flag would be appropriate here, assuming we can ever return the US to constitutional rule.</p>

		<p>Is this REALLY a controversy?  The media is starting to use this manipulative catchphrase alot.  Arizona&rsquo;s &#8220;controversial&#8221; immigration enforcement law, for example.  They keep repeating that word, &#8220;controversial&#8221; in front of something hoping it will manipulate how people feel about an issue.</p>
<p>However, real controversy involves strong opinions, often diametrically opposed, held by MANY people.  Before seeing this article on Amren, I didn&rsquo;t even know about it.  I suspect only .0000001% of mexicans know about it.  Of those, maybe 1% are offended&hellip;..and about half are extremely concerned because the meme of the cartoon is true.  They literally fear the flag of mexico falling one day soon&hellip;..and not to be replaced by a more enlightened government that has its best interests at hear.</p>
<p>Pay attention to that word &#8220;controversial&#8221; when it shows up in a context like this.  You are being manipulated.  It&rsquo;s playing on your emotions to be offended by others daring to be offended by this.  When in reality, nobody is offended and certainly nobody is rioting in the streets over this.  Pay attention to real issues and real behaviors that have real effects that are in YOUR self-interest.</p>

		<p>Since when are we Americans supposed to be governed by laws that Mexico has in place to dictate appropriate uses of the Mexican flag?  This is sheer hypocrisy of the first order, since we&rsquo;ve all seen Mexicans time and again desecrate the American flag in many ways, including flying it upside down below the Mexican flag.  I applaud Mr. Cagle&rsquo;s skills as a cartoonist, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of his commentary on Mexico and Mexicans.  I hope he NEVER apologizes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they shall beat their ploughshares into swords and their pruning hooks into spears.&#8221;</p>

<p>That &#8220;NY Girl&#8221; is one reason why we need to shut down the Mexican border, not just because of the illegals, but so the narcotics can&rsquo;t get in. That would make a huge reduction in the drug wars.</p>
<p>&#8220;United States of prejudice hypocrites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Americans don&rsquo;t illegally immigrate to our neighbor south of the border, wave American flags in THEIR streets and demand the right to be there illegally while at the same time allowing no illegal immigration and very little legal immigration, like the Mexicans do to us. If you want to see hypocrites, head on south of the border.</p>

<p>It is illegal under Mexican law for Americans to own beachfront property there.  In the meantime, mortgage companies - until recently - were writing home loans to criminal hypocrite Mexican invaders.</p>
<p>Before admission to a hospital in Mexico, an American must pay cash up front or provide proof of insurance up front.  In the meantime, we provide free hospital services to their criminal invading hypocrites.</p>
