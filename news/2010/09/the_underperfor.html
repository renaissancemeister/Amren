<h1>The Underperformance Problem</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell K. Nieli, Minding the Campus, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This state of affairs [the gap in SAT scores] is well known uncomfortable though it may be to bring up in public. Less well known is what in the scholarly literature is called &#8220;the underperformance problem.&#8221; Once in college blacks with the same entering SAT scores as whites and Asians earn substantially lower grades over their college careers and wind up with substantially lower class rankings. This gap in grade performance, moreover, is not reduced by adding high school grades or socio-economic status to the criteria for matching students. Blacks equally matched with whites or Asians in terms of their entering scholastic credentials and socio-economic backgrounds simply do not perform as well as their Asian and white counterparts in college. And the degree of underperformance is often very substantial.</p>
<p>This is contrary to what many people have been led to believe. Standardized tests are &#8220;culturally biased,&#8221; it is said, and do not fairly indicate the abilities or promise of racial minorities growing up outside the dominant white, middle-class, Anglo-Saxon culture. {snip} The &#8220;cultural bias&#8221; argument, however, is not only questionable on its face  &mdash;  since the clearly non-Anglo Saxon Asians do better than whites on most standardized tests of mathematical abilities including the SAT, while the equally non-Anglo Saxon Ashkenazic Jews outperform everyone else on tests of English verbal ability  &mdash;  but fails to account for the fact that in terms of grade performance blacks in college consistently do worse, not better, than their standardized test scores would predict. Standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT overpredict, not underpredict, how well blacks will do in college, and in this sense the tests are predictively biased in favor of blacks, not against them.</p>
<p>This &#8220;underperformance problem&#8221; has been well documented for over forty years. It first received widespread attention with the publication in 1985 of Robert Klitgaard&rsquo;s outstanding monograph, Choosing Elites, which dealt with admissions to America&rsquo;s most prestigious colleges and professional schools. It was also an important topic in William Bowen and Derek Bok&rsquo;s The Shape of the River (1998)  &mdash;  the highly influential defense of racial preference policies at elite universities by former presidents of Princeton and Harvard. It was an important topic, too, in the two subsequent River Books sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation  &mdash;  The Source of the River (2003), by Douglas Massey and his colleagues, and Taming the River (2009), by Camille Charles and her colleagues.</p>
<p>The scope of the underperformance problem is suggested in The Shape of the River. Using the College and Beyond (C&B;) database consisting of detailed statistics on students at 28 highly selective liberal arts colleges and research universities, the authors found that blacks and whites were separated by a rank-in-class gap of 30 percentile points  &mdash;  white students averaged at the 53d percentile, blacks at the 23d. {snip} &#8220;This unmistakable pattern,&#8221; Bowen and Bok add, &#8220;is found not only in the C&B; colleges but in professional schools as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Stereotype Threat</b></p>
<p>{snip} Much of the problem that black college students encounter in achieving grades commensurate with their proven abilities, Steele [Claude Steele, a psychologist] believes, is due to their tendency to internalize the image of black intellectual inferiority projected by the wider culture. As a result of this internalization, blacks often experience heightened test anxiety, Steele says, and do more poorly on college exams than would be the case in the absence of such a race-linked handicap. Steele and other researchers have shown within laboratory settings that black students do considerably worse on tests if they are told that the test is designed to determine their intellectual abilities than if the test is presented in a less threatening manner as a simple exercise in showing the mechanics of problem solving. (While Steele will only say so when pushed, our current system of racial preferences that places blacks in institutions where they must compete with whites and Asians who have usually gained entrance under more exacting standards almost surely contributes to this stereotype vulnerability.)</p>
<p>{snip} Two salient and undisputed facts limit its [the stereotype threat theory&rsquo;s] explanatory power. First, the problem of underperformance has been shown to extend far beyond the kinds of majors where test-taking is a central part of a student&rsquo;s overall evaluation. In many humanities, social science, and history courses written assignments and term papers  &mdash;  not timed, in-class exams  &mdash;  are the basis of a student&rsquo;s academic assessment but the underperformance of blacks has been shown to be an across-the-board phenomenon that is found even among black students majoring in these areas. {snip}</p>
<p>An even more serious problem with the stereotype threat explanation is the fact that {snip} blacks with the highest SAT scores and high school GPAs, many of whom have scores higher than the typical white or Asian student at the colleges they attend  &mdash;  and thus have good reason to feel intellectually superior, not inferior, to most of their classmates  &mdash;  are those underperforming the most. Those least likely to be troubled by feelings of intellectual inferiority or lack of academic self-confidence show the greatest performance gap when matched with whites and Asians of equivalently high SAT scores and high school grades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Disincentives of the Affirmative Action System</b></p>
<p>While acknowledging the probable effect of &#8220;stereotype threat,&#8221; authors like Bowen and Vars [William Bowen and Frederick Vars] realize that such an explanation goes only so far and cannot explain why blacks in all college subfields do worse than comparable whites and Asians, nor why it is the smartest blacks who underperform the most. The underperformance problem, however, is not nearly as enigmatic as these and other writers contend. Its most fundamental cause has been well explained in the past by critics of affirmative action in a manner that anyone with common sense can easily grasp. The real culprit here in discouraging black students to do their best and perform up to their potential, these critics explain, is the all-pervasive system of racial preferences that makes it much easier for black high school students to get into good colleges, and for black college students to gain access to good graduate schools, professional schools, and corporate sector jobs. The black students know that they don&rsquo;t have to do nearly as well in school as their white and Asian classmates to reach the same level of acceptance and achievement</p>
<p>The Manhattan Institute scholar John McWhorter, a linguist by training, explains the situation in its most cogent terms drawing from both his own experience as a black high school student in a mixed-race Philadelphia private school and from his many years of teaching black college students at Berkeley. &#8220;I can attest,&#8221; McWhorter writes, &#8220;that in secondary school I quite deliberately refrained from working to my highest potential because I knew that I would be accepted to even top universities without doing so. Almost any black child knows from an early age that there is something called affirmative action which means that black students are admitted to schools under lower standards than white; I was aware of this [from] at least the age of ten. {snip} In general, one could think of few better ways to depress a race&rsquo;s propensity for pushing itself to do its best in school than a policy ensuring that less-than-best efforts will have disproportionately high yield.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Racial preferences, says Steele [Shelby Steele], send out the message to black students that &#8220;mediocrity will win for them what only excellence wins for others.&#8221; In view of this message, for many black students the most attractive strategy becomes one of sitting back in class, taking it easy in school in terms of studying and hard work, and letting the whites and Asians toil away to get their good grades. The black students, says Steele, know that they don&rsquo;t have to perform at nearly the same level as their white and Asian schoolmates to advance along a similar career path. They can make up through race what they lack in performance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The high-SAT blacks, who are often the most intellectually gifted and have the highest IQs, know that professional schools and graduate schools look high and low for black students of their intellectual caliber and will admit them with much lower grades than their white and Asian counterparts. Since it is the most competitive graduate and professional schools that extend the greatest affirmative action boost to black applicants, it is not surprising that it is the best and brightest blacks who underperform the most. They know they need not get grades in college that come anywhere close to those of their white and Asian classmates to gain places in the most prestigious graduate institutions and in the most sought after corporations and law firms. While some students are internally driven to achieve at their maximum regardless of external rewards, and others receive relentless grade pressure from home, this is not how typical American students behave, and certainly not typical black students. (Participant observer studies have shown just how half-heartedly many black teen subcultures support academic striving even when there is no overt subcultural hostility of the kind that would stigmatize getting good grades as &#8220;acting white.&#8221;).</p>
<p><b>A Threatening Truth</b></p>
<p>Despite its common sense appeal and the testimony of many prominent black commentators, the &#8220;preference disincentive theory&#8221; is rarely taken up by proponents of affirmative action. It appears to be too threatening to their policy preferences even to be considered very seriously lest it turn out to be true{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Academic work in college is often arduous and demanding and surely less attractive for most young people than the alternatives of socializing with friends, listening to music, playing sports, and the like. Trade-offs will be made, and if black students are told that they can advance just as fast and go just as far in their career trajectory as similarly talented white or Asian students while doing much less demanding academic work than these other students, it is a deal many black students will readily accept. {snip}</p>
<p>None of what I have said here is rocket science or string theory. The failure of the academic establishment to acknowledge the obvious here in understanding the underperformance phenomenon can only be chalked up to a fear of discrediting the affirmative action policies they have long championed.<br/>

		<p>Absolutely no surprise here!  Unfortunately blacks especially in this country hvae been taught to expect that everything will be handed to them.  Never mind consistent hard work, dedication and discipline. Then add that old devil, &#8220;racism&#8221; to the formula, and of course blacks consistently underachieve.  Frankly, I&rsquo;m more than sick and tired of having to pay taxes for such a  dysfunctional race of people.</p>

		<p>Thomas Sowell has written that there are less than 1000 black students annually who score 700 or better on both sections of the SAT (under the old test). Since this number would not begin to meet the quotas at the Ivy League schools, guess what they admit a lot of marginal minority students. Most of the blacks admitted to places like MIT could do really well in a top notch state University. But in an MIT type environment, they are usually out of their league. (Read: Michelle Obama). </p>
<p>This trickles down even to the community college level. I would imagine that most everyone reading this blog who went to college at a place other than North Dakota State (or some REALLY white college) has been in class with an utterly unqualified minority. How many professors hand out the equivalent of a &#8220;Gentleman&rsquo;s C&#8221; even though the student had no clue of what they were doing there. I&rsquo;m sure the professors don&rsquo;t want to be accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; for failing this person. </p>

If stereotype threat is real, blacks should be thriving in majority black schools and historically black universities.</p>

<p>Follow the graduates after college. You&rsquo;ll find Asians and whites who earn the same degrees, even if they have higher grades, earn less money. Affirmative action doesn&rsquo;t stop at the university.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very substantial, because there&rsquo;s some cheating going on with these tests.  That&rsquo;s the logical answer.  </p>
<p>Too, it&rsquo;s suspicious that more than a tiny few blacks sciore the same on ANY tests than whites or Asians.</p>
<p>This just points up something else crooked about black scores.</p>
<p>Personally, I can&rsquo;t believe that the black group I.Q. average in the US is 85.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure some manipulation is going on by academic oddballs who do the testing or make up the tests for the sake of political correctness.</p>

		<p>Much of this article is true.  For black people failure is always an option like going on welfare, living off your girlfriend(s), dropping out of high school or going to prison.  Failing is a lot easier than succeeding and in the black community failure is seen as &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also a very destructive mindset in the white community that is never talked about.  How many white people are fine as long as black people are at the bottom.  The bottom becomes the standard at which these white people live their lives not the top.  So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you underperform in school as long as black people are doing worse everything is a-ok.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that Chinese have taken over your neighborhood as long as they are not black everything is swell.  Doesn&rsquo;t matter if your job is sent over to Asia as long as black people don&rsquo;t control the company life goes on.  In this mindset nothing matters except the position of black people in relation to white people.</p>

		<p>8 BlueBlood:</p>
<p>Re your second paragraph, I think I&rsquo;ll call it the BlueBlood Doctrine.  I&rsquo;ve kinda noticed it myself, in other ways.  </p>
<p>For instance, how many white people of mediocre talent, situation and circumstance feel better about themselves after having watched Maury Povich&rsquo;s &#8220;Wild Teens&#8221; shows?  (Native St. Louisan Sally Jesse Raphael loved that topic too.  To be honest, I think most of those &#8220;wild teen&#8221; stories are made up.  Teens that are as wild as these shows make them out to be would be either dead or in prison for a very long time.  Either way, they couldn&rsquo;t be on these trash TV shows.  My own mother once saw one of these shows, and asked me later on when talking about it, &#8220;you&rsquo;d think there&rsquo;d be at least one cop in that audience with arrest powers, who would arrest those girls after what they admitted.  This (expletive) is all made up.&#8221;)  </p>
<p>How many white administrators, teachers, staff and students at white schools best described as average or maybe &#8220;a bit rough&#8221; think they don&rsquo;t need to get any better after watching movies like &#8220;Lean on Me&#8221; or &#8220;Dangerous Minds&#8221; or &#8220;High School High?&#8221;</p>
<p>White parents   &mdash;   Do you like your teenagers listening to questionable white music artists, just because the black rappers and hip-hoppers are so much &#8220;worse?&#8221;  Eminem is not the sublime to the ridiculous of an Ice Cube.  Do you give your white sons a pass because he exposes an inch of his boxer shorts while sagging his pants, because the average for ghetto men is six inches?  Do you let your daughters dress less than respectably because &#8220;at least she&rsquo;s not wearing panties with &#8220;bootyho&#8221; stitched on the back end?</p>
<p>When you excuse low standards to spite even lower standards, you&rsquo;re still going to end up way down there.</p>

		<p>One simple explanation is that some blacks go to college simply to collect the financial aid, never considering what future value an education would have. Foresight is a trait lacking in most blacks.</p>

		<p>First the happy news. A few, very few, blacks do graduate college, do well there and end up on merit in grad school, med school,or in a profession. Good for them.</p>
<p>Bad news. Most blacks don&rsquo;t speak English. Many whites don&rsquo;t either. The difference is that whites, even most worker/high school grads but not college types, can come up with several or more synonyms for common words, and at least one word for a complex idea, e.g., &#8220;paradox&#8221; or inter-connection. Critical thinking is the dividing line:  anti-social behavior is inferred to be undesirable by the vast majority of whites; a lesser majority, if that of blacks.</p>
<p>And what makes anti-social behavior is quite narrow by black standards. Dumping your pregnant girlfriend is considered normal, not disgusting. </p>
<p>Being stoned all the time, which some whites are guilty of, is a widespread young black practice. Since there are relatively few blacks over the age of 40, due to anti-social behavior, these definitions do count.</p>
<p>Finally, an inability of practically all blacks to study for hours on end, a trait necessary for excellence in college and thus admission to top professional and grad schools, seals the deal. </p>
<p>Note I said &#8220;practically&#8221; all blacks, for those PC spies out there. </p>
<p>Poverty too is no excuse; those Jews or Italians, or many Irish,sixty years ago, and Asians for the past thirty years didn&rsquo;t have on the whole much money. They do now. And their obsessive dedication to learning paid off.</p>
<p>Hopefully the children of white immigrants won&rsquo;t donate any to the NAACP or the Black College or United Negro College Fund. (The Bush family does though, but then they supported Hitler too).</p>
<p>Blacks also attend to a large extent the mediocre laughable colleges like Tuskegee or Howard, or the numerous fifth class black-dominant state colleges in the South or Border States that somehow evaded desegregation by the liberal Justice Dept. </p>
<p>These high schools posing as colleges should be torn down, the land to be redeveloped as parks for Boy and Girls Scouts, most of whom are white since the Big Tough Blacks don&rsquo;t want to learn how to learn to start a (legal) fire, complete public service, swim, survive in the forest, or tie a knot.</p>
<p>Slave stuff you know.</p>

<p>To solve a problem, you must understand that the problem exists in the first place. Then secondly you must undestand the true nature of the problem. Otherwise, you cannot solve the problem. In all instances here, the problem cannot be solved, because the true nature of the problem is KNOWN, but not acknowledged. </p>

		<p>I often wonder how long it will be before some well-known black scholar goes on TV and matter-of-factly states that most American blacks are &#8220;not college material&#8221;.  The latter phrase used to be in common usage (referring primarily to whites) before political correctness and cultural sensitivity made it verboten.  This constant drumbeat for blacks with 70 IQ&rsquo;s to become PhD&rsquo;s has got to be extremely frustrating for the blacks concerned.  Society has made it all but impossible for a black man to, say, become a shoe-shiner because of forbidden racist images.  Low-class black culture has sunk to a level of pathological self-loathing, with its women treated as badly as any field slave ever could have been by a ruthless white man.  Men dress in garb reminiscent of beltless jail attire and exist in a crime-saturated environment.  Even the black man in the White House hasn&rsquo;t made things right, so what&rsquo;s there left to hope for?</p>

		<p>Mamy blacks don&rsquo;t do well in college because they have no business being there in the first place. They didn&rsquo;t do well in high school but could put a ball through a hoop or fulfilled a diversity quota so they get in instead of a more qualified White kid.</p>

		<p>My theory:  many of these black kids are in fact very bright.  However, because they went to a typical, dumbed-down black school, they never developed ANY study habits or other skills.  They simply had to show up and could make an A+ in everything.  Just because you&rsquo;re bright does not mean that you are going to be able to write an academic paper if you were never taught to.  </p>
<p>Basically, these schools FAILED their brightest kids because they made everything too easy.  These kids are being challenged in college for the first time and they really have no idea how to cope with it.  They developed no study habits because everything always &#8220;came easy to them.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I became interested in this subject while an undergraduate at UCLA in the 1980&rsquo;s. While mining the data on the grades of incoming frosh I discovered that 5 out of 6 black students were admitted as either a legacy (parents involved in the school), an athletic admit or an affirmative action admit. As 5 out of 6 blacks were starting their academic careers they stood in the batters&rsquo; box with an 0-2 count.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that the incoming class of black students were very clannish. It didn&rsquo;t take long for most to realize they were academically overmatched. I noticed that blacks almost universally did not join the informal study groups that students arrange among themselves to meet and discuss the material they are supposed to know. I watched a brand new black freshman pout and throw a fit in a study session because one of us writing on the board used cursive writing instead of printing everything out in block letters so he could decipher it. The blacks fill up &#8220;certain&#8221; classes because the professor had a well-known affection for athletes. I was unable to bust a group of cheating black athletes in a test I was monitoring because the prof. was afraid of being branded a racist. </p>
<p>Everything possible is done to make life easier for the incoming blacks. Minorities benefited at UCLA from the AAP Program. This meant that any incoming minority student got first crack at hard-to-get classes. White and Asian students close to graduation would have to wait for a chance to get into these classes until the new minorities had chosen. Everything was smoothed out for them as much as possible.</p>

		<p>I find odious the entire emphasis on &#8216;ranking&rsquo;, &#8216;toiling&rsquo;, &#8216;striving&rsquo;, and &#8216;competition&rsquo; in colleges.</p>
<p>One should be there to learn, not to &#8216;make grades&rsquo;.  My seemingly endless years in college were made miserable by the unrelenting need for grade-grubbing.</p>
<p>I was constantly distracted by the course material, which I found very interesting.  Unfortunately, mastering and absorbing the course material had little to do with jumping through the hoops one had to jump through, in order to &#8216;excel&rsquo;. While I frequently got perfect, or better-than-perfect (&#8216;bonus&rsquo;questions) scores on exams, for the duration of a course, I plotzed miserably, when it came to the inane and extraneous &#8216;project&rsquo; busy-work. I struggled to maintain a &#8216;B&rsquo; average.  I barely made it into the higher levels of my degree program. I lived on &#8216;Academic Probation&rsquo; for years.</p>
<p>In the business world, now, people who did far better than me in school, come to me as if I were some sort of magical mystic. &#8220;How do you KNOW that? It&rsquo;s like you just pull this stuff out of the air.&#8221;  And I wonder how they don&rsquo;t know &#8216;that&rsquo;, considering it is basic knowledge from basic course-work&hellip;or could easily be synthesized from that basic knowledge.  I guess they were too busy making straight &#8216;A&rsquo;s to learn anything. I suppose I&rsquo;ve become the proverbial &#8220;C-student who employs the B-students who were taught by the A-students.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I suspect that much if the insanity forced upon us by our &#8216;elites&rsquo; comes from them because they are the kind of mindless little grade-grubbing hoop-jumpers who excel, not at UNDERSTANDING, but at satisfying objectives set by others.  Once people like that reach positions of authority, they are dangerously incompetent at tasks actually requiring an empirical knowledge base, synthesis, and invention.</p>
<p>In America&rsquo;s Golden Age, colleges were places where one went to LEARN, in order that one might achieve, produce, and innovate.  Now, and immigration has much to do with this, they are places where one goes to COMPETE, merely in order to gain rank within groups of people&hellip;often, now, completely unproductive or counterproductive groups of people.   </p>

		<p>There is a sector of blacks who do well in college.  They understand the value of study and hard work and long term goals.  But these skills are not in the wider community.  A point which has been made to me by numerous inner city grade school teachers is that the large number of illegitimate births to young black women, on top of the welfare-drug culture, leads to a lack of interest in education.  All these things reflect choices that a lot of blacks have made.  But when it comes to the consequences of those choices, there is little accountability other than to use affirmative action to push aside qualified Whites.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>If stereotype threat is real, blacks should be thriving in majority black schools and historically black universities.</i></p>
<p>Or, indeed, in black run countries in Africa&hellip;</p>

<p>Until the 1950&rsquo;s or 60&rsquo;s (depending on the state), most public HBCU&rsquo;s were mandated to take only black or mulatto students. There was a HCBU in West Virginia that became predominantly white some years after WWII. (Bluefield State College). There are two problems with trying to force integration on these institutions. First, most whites will not tough them with a 10 foot pole. Second, you are not forced to attend college by the government (as of right now). I&rsquo;ve known ONE white person who attended a HBCU and he got in on a full ride baseball scholarship. After two years, he tried his hand at minor league ball. I think he made it to Double A. Since his abilities did not meet the expectations of Major League Baseball, he gave it up and became a police officer.  </p>
<p>What passes for poverty now is pretty ridiculous. If I could claim some sort of disability and round up 6 kids to get their &#8220;crazy checks&#8221;, I could make a rather tidy sum tax free. Think the 1930&rsquo;s and the Joad family; that&rsquo;s poverty. </p>
<p>About 550 - 600 people a year earn a PhD in Economics in the US. Of those, 9 - 12 are black. Unless they are a Serial Killer on the side, they have the red carpet rolled out when it comes to jobs. If some University or Corporation deems blacks with PhD&rsquo;s in Economics as valuable as finding a 1968 Dodge Charger with a 426 Hemi and only 10,000 miles, so be it. Are there blacks who can operate in a white world, yes there are. But not enough to satisfy all of the quotas. </p>

<p>To add to your point, I read earlier this year that for the first time in almost forever, Crenshaw High School in (what used to be called) South Central L.A., the high school made famous by the 1991 movie &#8220;Boys in the Hood,&#8221; and due to Hispanics pushing out enough blacks in those neighborhoods to make things safer for a few adventurous whites who want to live there, has a white basketball player.  The rest of the team is black, and the school is still majority black in spite of recent Hispanic demographic onslaught.  The article (from a &#8220;mainstream&#8221; sports magazine), admits that he&rsquo;s a constant victim of racial harassment from his teammates and other blacks in the school.  After all, his being on the team means that some black isn&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Deep in the article, it said that he has a B average.  </p>
<p>I thought to myself, &#8220;c&rsquo;mon man.  Can&rsquo;t we do a little better than a B average at a ghetto high school?  Getting a B average at a school like Crenshaw is having a pulse and three brain cells.&#8221;</p>
