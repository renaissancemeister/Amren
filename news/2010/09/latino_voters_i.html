			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cathleen Decker, Los Angeles Times, September 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latino voters, who have helped to propel California&rsquo;s leftward political swing over recent years, remain reluctant to embrace Republican candidates as the November general election nears, a new Los Angeles Times/USC poll shows.</p>
<p>Registered voters who identified themselves as Latino backed Democrat Jerry Brown by a 19-point margin over Republican Meg Whitman in the race for governor, despite Whitman&rsquo;s multiple appeals to Latino voters during the general election campaign. Registered voters who identified themselves as white gave Brown a slim 2-point margin.</p>
<p>In the race for U.S. Senate, incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer held a 38-point lead over Republican Carly Fiorina among registered Latino voters, five times the lead she held among white voters.</p>
<p>Latino views are keenly watched by political candidates and campaigns because of the state&rsquo;s demographic march. A 2009 study by the Field Poll found that white voters had declined from 83% to 65% of the electorate in the previous three decades. At the same time, the percentage of Latino voters had almost tripled, to 21%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not even the most optimistic Republican oddsmaker has presumed that the GOP candidates could win the Latino vote outright, but the party has long sought to at least boost its standing among Latinos enough to narrow the traditional Democratic edge among other groups, such as women and nonpartisan voters. This year, Whitman has fought Brown to a near-draw for much of the campaign, but that has been due to her gains among nonpartisan voters and women, not Latinos.</p>
<p>Whitman has reached for Latino support in myriad ways. She began airing ads on Spanish-language television stations after her June primary victory, highlighting her opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law. She also noted her opposition to the particulars of the 1994 California measure, Proposition 187, which would have denied taxpayer-financed services to illegal immigrants. She erected billboards in Latino communities, opened a campaign office in East Los Angeles and spoke to Spanish-language media outlets.</p>
<p>But she remains the favorite of only one-third of registered Latino voters, the survey found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When voters were asked whether they preferred a governor with experience in government or one who has &#8220;real-life experience in business,&#8221; white voters sided narrowly with the government veteran. Latinos, however, gave a 12-point advantage to the business world outsider. When voters were asked whether they were more concerned that Whitman would side with big corporations or that Brown would bow to labor unions, white voters cited Whitman and corporations by 8 points. Latinos were less worried, expressing the same concern by a mere 3 points, and they were no more concerned than whites with the personal money Whitman has spent on her campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whitman herself has long hoped that her business background and the growing small-business pursuits of Latinos would provide some common ground. &#8220;Latinas are the fastest-growing segment of the market in starting new businesses,&#8221; she told supporters at an Orange County event in May 2009, explaining why Latinos were a key component of her plan for victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, while white voters gave Brown a net unfavorable rating, by a 47%-42% margin, Latino voters gave Brown a favorable rating, 34% to 26%. Whites (48% to 36%) and Latinos (34% to 22%) both gave Whitman a net unfavorable rating.</p>
<p>{snip} Because they constitute smaller percentages of voters, the views of African American and Asian voters could not be compared in a statistically meaningful way.</p>

		<p>Meg Whitman wouldn&rsquo;t get my vote either! Any politician, whatever their party, who panders to minority interests deserves only the contempt of mainstream voters. When will Republicans learn that they can *never* appeal successfully to minority voters. The question really is: why would they want to? Is it simply that they&rsquo;ll do anything to achieve or retain office? They make me sick.</p>

		<p>I doubt the most ardent advocate of restrictions on immigration could effect substantial reduction in the Latino (or Asian) explosion and dominance in the most populous counties of that state.  </p>
<p>California is lost. Perhaps there are some counties or towns north of Sacremento and the Bay area that can retain their European identity simply because the welfare and schools in the Southern part of the state suit the Latinos better.  The Asians have their stronghold in San Francisco and the Bay area. The state universities and the towns around them are seas of yellow and brown.</p>
<p>Jerry Brown: You couldn&rsquo;t save Oakland. You won&rsquo;t save California either. But you are a true radical left-wing Catholic, not far from where most of your priests and Bishops stand these days. Mad, but sincere. </p>
<p>At least you believe in something, unlike Boxer and the PC Liberals who destroyed the once-Golden State.</p>

<p>Start listening to your white voting base that got you into power and not hispanics and blacks, most of whom vote against you nine times out of ten.  </p>

		<p>Time for the application of Occam&rsquo;s Razor.</p>
<p>Outgoing New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was a Clinton cabinet secretary before and would have been an Obama cabinet secretary save a show-stopping scandal, was asked what Hispanic voters really want.  Those asking him the question asked something along the lines of, &#8220;Do they want the American Southwest returned to Mexico or something like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Richardson&rsquo;s answer started something along the lines of &#8220;no, it&rsquo;s not a hard answer at all.&#8221;  He then followed that with these exact words I&rsquo;ll remember even if I get to be a thousand years old:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fully funded welfare programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is why Democrats will always win the Chicano and Afro/Mulatto Hispanic vote.  They can always promise more welfare than even the most obnoxious RINO.</p>

<p>Of course!  Why is it republicans (Whites) are so stupid? They &#8220;think&#8221; they have to &#8220;reach out&#8221; to so-called &#8220;Latinos&#8221; now more than ever to get their votes, instead of reaching out to their base, WHITES, for once!  What a farce!</p>
<p> Latinos want what the DEMS give them, period. Freebies.  Do they not know that being for illegal and legal immigration is a sure fire way to make sure that the White Republicans will NEVER win a race again? Demographics rule and the Repubs would have to become just like the DEMS to ever win again. They need to be pushing for deportations, putting the military on the border with orders to shoot, no more LEGAL immigrants from any 3rd world country, no more anchor babies and make that retroactive, no housing, jobs, schools, medical care for any illegal.</p>
<p>But of course we all know that the GOP is too wimpy and cowardly to any of the above. </p>

		<p>This happens year after year, election after election.  Republicans (the stupid party) pander to mexicans only to lose time after time.  Then they assume they lost because they didn&rsquo;t pander enough. Republicans only have a few election cycles left before they are completely overwhelmed by immigrants and ethnics voting for democrats. </p>

<p>And this worthless white RINO harlot, thinks that life is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; because only 33% of Latinos are going to vote for her?</p>
<p>It should be a question as to why so many whites (almost half) do not see her as a possibly competent candidate for the California Governor&rsquo;s mansion? Is it because of her pandering record of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; treason, or simply a case of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; disgust for whites? I would hazard a guess, that it is a weary synergism of the two in the white electorate&rsquo;s minds. No matter what they do, they get the short end of the stick; even when legally passing a law like Proposition 187, it gets ignored and they get degraded as &ldquo;racists&rdquo; for even trying to assert their own interests and pocketbooks. </p>
<p>In psychology, we would call this a combination of learned helplessness and reaction formation in response to it. As they can never be absolved of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; when voting for their interests with a party that cynically &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; them and then rejects them in terms of policy and legislation, they simply abandon that party and side with the one that openly calls for their: pillage, rape, and  destruction!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>HISPANICS WILL NEVER VOTE GOP, NEVER.</p>
<p>Bush supported Amnesty and tried to get it passed.  He received less Hispanic votes than before.  Bush appointed a Hispanic to Attorney General and he got less votes than before.  McCain sponsored the Amenesty and lost the Hispanic vote to Obama.  The GOP has stabbed white people in the back for the last time.  The GOP will find itself on the garbage pile of history if they try to knife us in the back again.  Being white in America is now a hate crime.</p>

<p>Now for a bit of speculative levity!</p>
<p>Why is it that Asians and African Americans cannot synchronize and specialize their &ldquo;common interests&rdquo; into a coherently significant and statistically meaningful way of stopping this &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; tsunami of salsa?</p>
<p>Oh, I know, &ldquo;whitey&rsquo;s&rdquo; ever &ldquo;racist&rdquo; hand upon diversity&rsquo;s destruction?</p>

		<p>The Republican Party exists in order to advance the interests of the richest ten percent of the country.  These benefit from a high rate of immigration, because the increased competition for jobs makes it easy for them to force pay cuts.  </p>

<p>If 65 percent of the voters are still White in a state that is 40 percent White then there&rsquo;s a huge number of illegal immigrants and green card holders without citizenship.  Removing these people is just a matter of changing the immigration laws, denying renewal of visas and enforcement of the laws. </p>

		<p>Now that Whitman has thrown in with the pro-illegal, anti-AZ law crowd, her prospects as a GOP pol are over.  She can&rsquo;t carry  anti-illegal whites (and blacks and Hispanics, for that matter) AND pro-illegal voters.  <br/>
California is full of conservative white areas, especially in the north.  If the Tea Party could get these folks out, a Republican would have a fighting chance.  But, like Obama, Whitman made the mistake of thinking one can pander to pro-illegals and mainstream whites at the same time.</p>

		<p>As long as Republican leadership consists of people like Karl Rove, Grover Norquist, John McCain, Ken Mehlman, Jack Kemp and Meg Whitman, obsessed with &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to nonwhite voters who will never reciprocate, the GOP is doomed, most of all in high-minority states like California.  Arnold Schwarzenegger won on star appeal and the unpopularity of predecessor Gray Davis, not on beliefs.  </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand most of the Democrats (there are a few exceptions), but a victory by Whitman would serve notice that the Republicans are the party of mass immigration enthusiasm.  Good riddance to her if she loses.</p>

		<p>When will REALITY ever be accepted?<br/>
There are 23 Latin American countries..they ALL look and<br/>
behave the same. Furthermore, when hispanics come to the USA<br/>
they turn American cities into Latin American looking ghettos.<br/>
Hispanic countries, hispanic cities, hispanic culture isnt<br/>
an accident&hellip;it happens inevitably and it happens because<br/>
of the IQ, and emotional patterns of hispanics. What do<br/>
whites think they are going to get by pandering to it? </p>

		<p>The same radical groups have infiltrated both the republican and democratic parties.  Which is why, despite having diametrically opposed views on most issues, their implemented policies have been exactly the same.  No one has made this more perfectly crystal clear than Obama&hellip;..who governs as if George Bush Jr&rsquo;s brain had been scooped out of his skull and transplanted into a new body to enjoy a third term.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t the issue.  Waking up the republican party is not the issue.  The issue is the breakdown of American institutions and the threatened dissolution of federal power toward state power.</p>
<p>The communists took us over.  They failed.  Once in, they couldn&rsquo;t handle the power and everything is falling apart.  That has left a power vacuum.  With regard to the GOP, the result has been many communist infiltrators being replaced by actual legitimate candidates&hellip;..the type of people who will be open to doing what their (white) electorate wants.  Now is the time to push for political power in the GOP.</p>
<p>Will it succeed?  Maybe.  But understand that if it does not, the states are practically chomping at the bit to shut down federal powers and determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means where you live is a rather big deal.  Look closely at who runs your state and local governments.  Don&rsquo;t agree with them?  Move.  And soon.  A few years from now, that might not be easy to do.</p>

<p>What a revelation&hellip;..I have been to many anti-illegal events in SoCal where communist, socialist, marxist literature is OPENLY sold where the mexican socialists hang out.  You won&rsquo;t see it on the lame-stream media, but you will see Che shirts, red flags, anarchy groups, all the commie/anti-white garbage when you go in person.  Leftward?  Absolutely communist!  </p>
<p>Whitman?  What a joke!  Typical RINO.  I, for one, am voting American Independent.  I am SO tired of voting for the lesser of two evils, no more.  God, I wish I could move out of this leftist paradise in SoCal&hellip;</p>
