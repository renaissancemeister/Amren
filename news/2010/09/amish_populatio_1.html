<h1><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-09-14-amish-population_N.htm">Amish Population Growing, Heading West</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Martin, USA Today, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bright yellow signs with a horse and buggy symbol dot the gravel roads in the gently rolling hills near here, and the town has placed hitching posts for horses along Main Street.</p>
<p>The new road signs, more familiar in rural areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, are emblems of a trend being seen in many Western states which are welcoming an increasing number of Amish.</p>
<p>The Amish population is growing and embarking on a westward migration that has now reached as far as Colorado, South Dakota and Montana, according to an annual survey by Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, which tracks the Amish.</p>
<p>In the past year, the North American Amish population has grown 5%, an increase from 237,500 in 2009 to 249,500 today, the survey found.</p>
<p>{snip} The survey attributes the population boom to Amish families tending to be large, with five children or more on average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reasons for the Amish migration are varied, but some have left states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania as development has encroached into the rural areas where they&rsquo;ve traditionally lived, says Donald Kraybill, a professor at Elizabethtown College who has done extensive research on Amish culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In southeastern South Dakota, about 70 Amish live near the small town of Tripp, and routinely visit local stores to pick up supplies for their dairy farms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Klatt makes the handmade signs seen around town that advertise weekly bake sales at one of the Amish farmsteads, and she visits them occasionally and tries to bring along strawberry-flavored marshmallows or some other special treat for the Amish children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the state with the most Amish (nearly 60,000), the economic downturn has led some Amish to seek work they&rsquo;ve never considered before. Outside Lancaster, Elias Beiler recently bought a restaurant business and potato chip company because of a slowdown in the building industry.</p>

		<p>That Amish people have large families is in line with their lifestyle, which is mostly based on the 19th century, aguarian model.  My own ancestors had anywhere from 8-14 children, and were not Amish.  But they were farmers.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always respected the Amish, and they are, of course, 100% white and always will be (since they are so clannish and they only marry their own - and they don&rsquo;t accept converts).</p>
<p>The trouble they will have is with their pacifism.  The first time a carload of latino drug runners enter one of their towns and realize they can rule the Amish with a few pistols, then that great link to our european past will be choked off but fast.</p>

		<p>My neighbors are Mennonite, they are Annabaptists like the Amish. They do not vote, serve in the military, fly a flag, etc. what&rsquo;s bad is they bring in through their missions a large amount of Latin people to this country. They believe everyone deserves to be here, no strings attached.I understand being kind, but our country csn&rsquo;t stand much more.</p>

		<p>Most people assume the Amish are still 100% white, but here in Missouri (and friends in Ohio tell me), there are getting to be more miscegenated Amish and Old/&#8221;New&#8221; Order Mennonites. It is worse than sad. Their white guilt is destroying them!</p>

		<p>When I read stories like this, I have a little fear in my heart that the author of the article is placing a bullseye on the Amish. Our elites don&rsquo;t want a growing White population. They want us replaced by a brown bio-mass. </p>
<p>If the radical leftists ever gained total control of this country like they did in Russia (1917), the Amish would be one of the first groups to be liquidated.</p>
<p>I live in Macomb County Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Macomb used to be only 1% black. Then, story after story in the mass media came out about how Macomb residents were racists and the entire county was racist for only having 1% black. Macomb was targeted by the State and Federal Government to be &#8220;block busted.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Feds subsidized rents and housing down payments for blacks from Detroit to move in. Now, 10 years later, Macomb is about 15% black and another 5% Arab/Indian/Asian. In ten years, 1 in 5 Macomb residents are now non-White. Now, I hear many White people talking about moving further out. And the cycle of White displacement continues.</p>

		<p>I saw some some  Amish folks at an urban Leftist farmers market here in Chicago -<br>
 <br>
was surprised to see the Leftist sponsoring group give the Amish a pass because they were pacifists   - a White patriarchal family with seven white children. But it was all good.</p>
<p>Amish are great White folks.</p>

		<p>Socially and politically the results of a high birth rate are significantly less harmful than those of a high immigration rate.  Economically and environmentally the results are similar.  Population growth means that there is less of everything good to go around.   <br>
     <br>
On the other hand, after Bubonic Plague reduced the population of Europe by one third the standard of living of the Europeans was higher than ever before in history: wages went up; prices went down. Currently the European standard of living and health are again higher than ever before in history.  This is because of advances in technology, and a low birth rate. Japan and China also benefit from low birth rates.  The Arab world and Africa suffer because of high birth rates (among other things).       <br>
     <br>
One can express the relationship between population and standard of living with an equation:<br>
(natural resources * level of technology * average intelligence) / population = standard of living. <br>

<p>Multicultural Marxists tend to hate any notion of white<br>
Americanism and moral purity associated with American<br>
beliefs.<br>
In the last decade thousands of blacks and puerto ricans<br>
have poured into the Lancaster city area of Pennsylvania from<br>
hell holes in New York city seeking refuge from poverty<br>
and crime only to demonstrate the same behavior.<br>
The local goverment consists of a cluster of totalitarian<br>
socialists and pro-homosexual activists.<br>
The situation has lead to a boiling caldron of political and economic frustration that is adversely affecting people particularly among the new order amish who must deal<br>
with a world of crime just outside their communities and<br>
the refusal of Lancaster city government to admit<br>
the area is a danger zone.</p>

<p>The Amish aren&rsquo;t really &#8220;pacifists&#8221; - because in this age in America - White folks having 5-8 children, having a male head of household and home bound wife and mother is basically declaring all out war on the ruling elite powers that be.</p>
<p>In my local urban, university Leftist/Communist run farmers market, Leftist community center, I shocked that the Amish are invited and welcomed - and it is because of this &#8220;pacifist&#8221; side. If a same group of Whites did everything the Amish do but believed in gun ownership they would be defamed as a dangerous hate cult by SPLC.</p>

<p>Of that there can be no doubt!  Fortunately for the Amish, though they by and large obey the &#8216;laws of the land&rsquo;, they really have no loyalty to this country.  If things ever get too hairy here for them, more than likely the bulk of them will pack up and head for greener pastures, the way their ancestors did in the 18th century when they abandoned the Palatinate and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The Amish will probably still be around, tending their fields, long after we&rsquo;re a footnote in someone&rsquo;s history book.  Go Amish!</p>

		<p>to say that their high birth rate is due to agrarian lifestyle is to miss the forest for the trees. High marriage and birth rate can easily be sustained in a well-managed, prosperous urban industrial society, just ask the &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; of the 1950s giving rise to the &#8220;Baby Boomers&#8221; (boy, was that a bad idea, as it turns out&hellip;).</p>
<p>A young man will marry and have many children if he has reasonable expectation of a job that will sustain his family. As well as (said to even have to bring this up) of his wife&rsquo;s staying with him for the foreseeable future rather than going to divorce court within three years.</p>
<p>Well, so clearly Amish do well on both counts. They manage their educational system and their economy in such a way as to train and position their young men to have a decent steady job (i.e. farmer). And they make sure that families stay together just as they are supposed to in any decent society. So in a way they are running an intelligently-regulated, semi-autarchic protectionist economy that is doing very well in the midst of the our larger really stupidly-regulated, import-dependent, anti-domestic producer economy. Not surprisingly then, as long as the government does not crush them with tyrannical laws, they are happy, prosperous and demographically growing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just their pacificism that endears the Amish to the Left. It&rsquo;s also their  Minority status and their cultural opposition to the Majority. Anything that appears to aid the Left in breaking down the hegemony of the hated Majority is welcomed and deemed as good.</p>
<p>Among the people who furnish the ideological inspiration behind the Left, there are certain key words that are weighted with additional meaning.  Paramount among those words are &#8220;minority&#8221; =  automatically good; and &#8220;majority&#8221; = evil, oppressive, and automatically bad. This is a form of knee-jerk thinking that all of the Left engages in.</p>
<p>And so, the Amish, though white, constitute at least a cultural minority in contradistinction to the majority, thus placing them within the category of sacrosanct minorities who are automatically &#8220;good&#8221;. Anything that is in opposition to the white, dominant majority is &#8220;good&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It might be preferable if they were non-white as well. But nonetheless, being a &#8220;minority&#8221; group makes them &#8220;good&#8221;.  And so they are smiled upon, just as a group of white lesbians would be smiled upon. Anything that goes against the grain, anything that undercuts the establishment culture, anything that&rsquo;s non-majority   &mdash;   THAT&rsquo;S the key.<br>

I wish all White families could do the same. But the thing is, both spouses tend to work, in the modern world we&rsquo;ve created. </p>
<p>Latinos who live on welfare, do not have such a &#8220;problem&#8221;, so they tend to reproduce a lot.<br>

<p>Be careful who you call &#8220;Amish&#8221;.  The Old Order Amish are the groups most people (researchers included) think about in popular culture when the term &#8220;Amish&#8221; comes to mind.  First of all, these peoples are not members of any hierarchial organization (like the Catholics and Protestants).  Even if an Amish community were to miscegenate, the likelihood of that spreading to others is very slim.</p>
<p>Secondly, these peoples do not engage in any missionary activity, proslytizing others to their way of life.  Why should they?  Even if you factor out the numbers who &#8216;leave the fold&rsquo;, they are breeding well above the replacement level!</p>
<p>Finally, the social structures of Old Order Amish communities makes it extremely difficult for any non-Amish to join.  Let&rsquo;s also not kid ourselves, people: how many non-Amish Whites, let alone non-Whites, would even want to become Old Order Amish in this day and age of TV, electricity, automobiles, etc.?</p>
<p>The only &#8220;Amish&#8221; who proslytize and engage in missionary activity are the so-called &#8220;Beachy Amish&#8221; who are not really Amish at all, but Mennonites.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fret, folks, the Old Order Amish are a genetically homogenous population and will undoubtedly continue to remain so for generations to come.  They actually have a much greater problem with inbreeding than outbreeding.</p>

		<p>The Amish DO allow conversions, but even if you speak fluent German and share their religious beliefs, it is impossible for a newcomer to fit in, because all of the Amish within a small Amish community are relatives of one another.  Without kinship ties, you NEVER can be a real part of the Amish community.</p>
