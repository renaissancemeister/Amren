			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Robinkam, Florida Today, September 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Hazleton, Pa., may not enforce its crackdown on illegal immigrants, dealing another blow to 4-year-old regulations that inspired similar measures around the country.</p>
<p>The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said that Hazleton&rsquo;s Illegal Immigration Relief Act usurped the federal government&rsquo;s exclusive power to regulate immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not our job to sit in judgment of whether state and local frustration about federal immigration policy is warranted. We are, however, required to intervene when states and localities directly undermine the federal objectives embodied in statutes enacted by Congress,&#8221; wrote Chief Judge Theodore McKee.</p>
<p>The northeastern Pennsylvania city had sought to fine landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and deny business permits to companies that give them jobs. A companion measure required prospective tenants to register with City Hall and pay for a rental permit.</p>
<p>Mayor Lou Barletta had pushed the measures in 2006 after two illegal immigrants were charged in a fatal shooting. The Republican mayor, now mounting his third try for Congress, argued that illegal immigrants brought drugs, crime and gangs to the city of more than 30,000 and overwhelmed police, schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>Hispanic groups and illegal immigrants sued to overturn the measures, and a federal judge struck them down following a trial in 2007. The laws have never been enforced.</p>

		<p>The 3rd Circus is based in Philadelphia, a city whose Quaker/egalitarian civic elite have been advocates of racial equality ever since the days of Ben Franklin.  So this ruling doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>
<p>The good news from this is that it might force SCOTUS&rsquo;s hand sooner than the SB 1070 case could get to them.  I tend to think that Hazleton&rsquo;s ordinance and SB 1070 are enough alike such that a SCOTUS ruling on one is precedent enough for the other.</p>
<p>The other &#8220;good&#8221; news is that the media now admit that Hazleton is full of illegal aliens.  Before now, the media party line is that it wasn&rsquo;t a problem in Hazleton, and that Barletta was cynically latching onto an issue to grease the skids to run for higher office.</p>
<p>And this probably puts Barletta over the top in his Congressional run.</p>

		<p>I would like these judges to explain how if the federal law states that it is illegal to provide housing and employment to illegal aliens subject to a fine up to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment that a local law which makes it illegal to provide housing and employment to ILLEGAL aliens &#8220;usurps&#8221; the federal government&rsquo;s authority over immigration.  Hazleton&rsquo;s law similar to that of the one in Arizona only mirror what is already not permitted.  Additionally, I would also like to know how 5 of the plaintiffs against Hazleton were able to file suit against the city when they were admittedly in the country illegally.  How does someone who does not have a right to be in the country have the &#8220;right&#8221; to file suit against a lawfully enacted ordinance by an elected city government? Being from Hazleton and witnessing firsthand the invasion of the city by these Third World Hispanics I wish Mayor Barletta just like Governor Brewer would tell the federal government to go * itself and enforce the laws anyway.  This is getting outright ridiculous with these judges.  How about American citizens filing suit against Obama, his administration, and the members of Congress for dereliction of duty in not enforcing the laws of this country?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It is &hellip; not our job to sit in judgment of whether state and local frustration about federal immigration policy is warranted. We are, however, required to intervene when states and localities directly undermine the federal objectives embodied in statutes enacted by Congress,&rdquo; wrote Chief Judge Theodore McKee.&#8221;</p>
<p>1) Judge McKee: &#8220;We the people&#8221; didn&rsquo;t ask you to &#8220;sit in judgment&#8221; on &#8220;state and local frustration&#8221;. Our fathers&rsquo; first stated objective when they did &#8220;ordain and establish&#8221; the US Constitution was to &#8220;form a more perfect union&#8221; - at least according to the Preamble I learned in school.</p>
<p>2) No, you swore to judge lawlessness (like illegal aliens and a Federal Government that willfully lets them get away with it - NOT &#8220;state and local frustration&#8221; - that is, until a law is broken, which did not happen.</p>
<p>3)By NO logic I know does a &#8220;free State&#8221; (see 2nd Amendment) or locality &#8220;directly undermine the federal objectives embodied in statutes enacted by Congress&#8221; when &#8220;federal objectives&#8221; per the current Federal Government&rsquo;s behavior so obviously run contrary to existing federal immigration law.</p>
<p>4) If you take the Federal Government&rsquo;s side when they break the law, and &#8220;frustrate&#8221; lower governments when they do the Feds&rsquo; job, don&rsquo;t be surprised if people have a hard time respecting YOUR enforcement of law.</p>
<p>5) The Bible on which you presumably swore when you covenanted with the American people to defend the Constitution prescribes serious sanctions against covenant-breakers. See, for example, Jer. 34:8-22. </p>

<p>So invaders, aided and abetted by Quisling &ldquo;judges,&rdquo; have finally proven that the federal government is totally worthless. That, or worse; this being that it is a hostile oligarchy driven by an alien ideological and neocolonial mindset. What else can be inferred when a federal &ldquo;judge&rdquo; states: &ldquo;It is &hellip; not our job to sit in judgment of whether state and local frustration about federal immigration policy is warranted. We are, however, required to intervene when states and localities directly undermine the federal objectives embodied in statutes enacted by Congress&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, and of course, there is no consideration of the possibility that &ldquo;statutes enacted by Congress,&rdquo; are quite possibly undermining the Constitutionally protected rights of state and local jurisdictions to protect themselves, because they might be at best misguided and at worst treasonable actions on the part of that Congress.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>This is just one of many rulings in recent years, which to me, clearly illustrates that the Federal Judiciary is totally out of<br>
control. The have consistently opposed and overriden reasonable legislation at the state and local level by bending, twisting, and perverting existing law and the Constitution. This along with the Federal government&rsquo;s actions with regard to the border and illegal immigration can only lead me to believe that the Federal government is engaged in what essentially amounts to a war against the people of the United States. I think the final straw for me has been the government&rsquo;s response to the so-called &#8220;Burn a Koran Day&#8221;. I cannot believe that our government actually sent agents to intimidate a U.S. citizen that was making a political statement protected by the Constitution. Our government, and Corporate America have betrayed us in every sense of the word.</p>

		<p>Oh, so if States pass a copy law, such as having a 2nd Amendment protection in THEIR STATE constitution, then that is &#8220;usurping federal statutes&#8221;?  Especially if the State honors that State mirror constitutional amendment and the federal government now abrogates it?  If the feds aren&rsquo;t interested in protecting the second amendment or abiding by it, the States cannot as that would be interfering in federal enforcement?<br>
Bull.  How about this.  You feds want to run our schools, run our banks, run every aspect of our lives with your federal statutes and rulings.  You claim that is your federal privilege.  Fine.  How about we states just follow our State sovereign passed laws and prosecute them alone, and let you Feds enforce YOUR federal laws on your own without State help or sanction.  Entirely.  You want federal mandated instruction in our schools.  YOU send enforcement officers to each and every State school and make them do so.  The States won&rsquo;t do it for you, as that would be infringing on your federal privileges.  A federal felon crosses into a State&rsquo;s jurisdiction for a federal crime, how about the State prosecute him for violating State law and refusing to render him to you or arrest him for the federal violation.<br>
That would be infringing on your federal privilege.  YOU find him and catch him, and as long as he committed no crime in our state, we let him be and ignore him.  Break any of our State laws doing so though, and YOU get arrested.  In fact, with all your federal laws and statutes including federal taxes, how about we stop collecting them or enforcing them and let YOU do it for 300 million folks without State help.  After all, as you&rsquo;ve said, it&rsquo;s YOUR job and YOUR job alone.  We can&rsquo;t help you, by your arrogant judge&rsquo;s order.  How would that be?</p>

<p>Thanks to the &#8220;incorporation doctrine&#8221; of the 14th Amendment, states are pretty much required to have carbon copies of the Bill of Rights in their own constitutions.  Most had most of the BoR in their constitutions anyway, even without the I/D.</p>

		<p>There is a silver lining in this cloud of madness, and that is the undisputable fact that the Dems are going to take a major beating in the Nov. election.  Almost every day there&rsquo;s some new example of lunatic-fringe behavior on the left.  The wall-to-wall coverage of Pastor Jones, painting him as loony, is one.  The glorifying of the Ground Zero imam  &mdash;  who has now threatened terrorism if he doesn&rsquo;t get his way  &mdash;  is another.  Federal suit after suit against the states is still another.<br>
Last night, two legislators from RI were on Fox, on Greta&rsquo;s show, stating that their little state can no longer carry the burden of illegals on their welfare system.  They had gone to AZ to confer with Brewer, Arpaio, and others.  <br>
Obama now has a Sec. of State who is openly criticizing his spending and states ready to revolt en mass.  He&rsquo;s allowing a down-home Southern preacher to jerk him around in an almost comedic melodrama.  And the Tea Party rallies go on and on.</p>

		<p>This system is so rotten it putrefies beyond the imagination.  The legal ruling is a &ldquo;catch 22&rdquo; scenario.  The state cannot usurp the federal government&rsquo;s enforcement of the law(s) yet the federal government is not going to enforce the law(s).  So, if this is the case, how can the city of New York usurp the 2nd Amendment (which is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights [federal law]); how can Cook County (Chicago, Illinois) not allow the 2nd Amendment (which is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights [federal law]); how can the state of California not allow certain weaponry protected by the 2nd Amendment (which is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights [federal law]); etc?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fundamentally a law will be influenced principally by two forces from which it will receive its characteristic coloring: first by the moral character of the people in whose midst it comes into force, and secondly, by the analytical acuteness of the people.  By the happy union of both&rdquo; (Chamberlain, Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, p. 145).  First, as European American citizens, we are the people that the ruling affects and, second, by an analytical acuteness the ruling is ludicrous.  These judges are ruling in favor of an entity (federal government) which will not enforce the law; these judges realize this.  In essence, they are ruling for the rights foreigners over the rights of citizens and, truly, against the will of the people.  Such is not a happy union.</p>
<p>Whatever the legal rhetoric spewed forth by these judges, the law is not a pick and chose element.                    <br>

		<p>Why do we always count on politicians to make everything right for us?  That attitude is the cause of most of our problems. <br>
If people don&rsquo;t want landlords to rent to illegal aliens and they don&rsquo;t want employers to hire them, then why don&rsquo;t they apply direct pressure on those landlords and employers. <br>
Take a lesson from ACORN and SEIU.  Picket the buildings in which the illegals live and the companies where they work.  Picket the homes of the offending landlords and company officials.  No violence, of course, but get loud enough to make their families and neighbors nervous.  File nuisance lawsuits.  <br>
Keep a close watch on the properties that are rented to illegals and report any violations of city or county ordinances that you observe.  Most cities have rules against storing cars that have flat or missing tires. There may also be ordinances that pertain to un-mowed lawns, fire hazards, improperly stored junk refrigerators, eyesores such as peeling paint, and even ordinances that prohibit water-filled buckets and tubs where mosquitoes can breed.<br>
If greedy landlords and employers are making you unhappy by thrusting illegal aliens into your life, then spread the unhappiness around. You don&rsquo;t need the help of a damned politician.</p>
