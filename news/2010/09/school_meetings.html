<h1>School Meetings for Only Black Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WJXT-TV (Jacksonville, Florida), September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school district said it held a series of meetings for only their black students to encourage them to do better in school.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the principal [of Ware County High School] became concerned over low test scores and wanted to invite black speakers to address them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Princess Golden, a student who said she was required to be in the meeting, said she was shocked, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kind of upset me because I&rsquo;m thinking, &#8216;Are black people going to be lower than the white kids?&rsquo;&#8221; Golden said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the data [available online on the Georgia Department of Education&rsquo;s website], the latest numbers show that 12 percent of black students at Ware County High School failed the math portion of the Georgia High School Graduation test, and 16 percent failed the language arts portion. That compares to 2 percent of white students who failed the math portion and 4 percent who failed the language arts portion.</p>
<p>With a population of about 1,200 students, 40 percent are black at Ware County High School, and all of the black students had to go to the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&rsquo;re going to have a meeting, why can&rsquo;t you have that with everybody?&#8221; Taylor [Penny Taylor, a parent of a student at Ware County High School] said. &#8220;We have been segregated enough.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Two things:</p>
<p>#1  The pass rates for blacks at this school are so much higher than for black students in many other areas.  Why they be complainen&rsquo;?</p>
<p>#2  There are all black clubs, scholarships for blacks only, a black cable station, etc&hellip;  Now they&rsquo;re complaining when they have a black meeting?</p>

		<p>We applaud all efforts of blacks to act tribal. We want more. Please, afros, be more afro.</p>
<p>White students will be less receptive to Diversity is Our Strength when their sense of fairness and equality are offended by blacks only pep talks.</p>
<p>If I were rich, I&rsquo;d found a charity that pays to send <br>
community facilitators into schools for forcing forces White students to attend Diversity Sensitivity Sessions, and then kick them out of the room so the NAACP can organize the black students to protest for more Equality.  Then create some sort of venue or forum where the White students can share their frustrations and form healthy White Identities centered on the resentment of White Dispossession.   We have a treasure in our grievances, and we should spend it.</p>

		<p>This is ridiculous. The people who claim they want a &ldquo;raceless&rdquo; society are full of lies. They want their own people to advance, and there is nothing wrong with that, the only problem is, why can&rsquo;t we? The only people I have ever known who want a &ldquo;raceless&rdquo; society are typically fellow Euro-Americans who have rarely even had contact with non-Europeans. <br>
You know if white school leaders ever did this for white students, they would be publicly crucified.  <br>

		<p>It does seem terribly silly to require all black students and their parents to a meeting to encourage them to score higher on standardized exams.</p>
<p>I am just naturally curious if the Obama types also had to attend, i.e. half-black students with white moms? Were they treated the same as those half-black students with black moms? And what did they tell the Hispanic students&hellip;..heck, they are in Georgia, I am sure there are plenty&hellip;..and about half of them quit school before they graduate&hellip;..so I guess only half of them ever take the standardized tests. Still, I doubt they quit school because their standardized test scores are too high.</p>
<p>Maybe the meeting would have been more productive if ALL of the students and their parents with less than a &#8220;C&#8221; average had been invited instead. Computers are marvelous at this sort of thing&hellip;.can even do a mail merge to pump out the letters, sorted any way you like.</p>

		<p>Miss Golden, supposedly one of these &#8220;under-performing&#8221; black students, picked up on something that the school&rsquo;s administration and teachers evidently could not   &mdash;   That this segregated meeting is only going to send the subtle message to the black students that they&rsquo;re dragging the school&rsquo;s average down.

<p>Is it not self-evident? The white kids didn&rsquo;t need exposure to &#8220;role models&#8221;, and I&rsquo;ll wager that the time they had to themselves in class was pleasant in the extreme.</p>
<p>That said, clumsy move by the school district. This is Black Run America, after all. How long before Eric Holder and Arne Duncan are on the case?</p>

<p>Like that&rsquo;s going to help.</p>
<p>These people are incessantly grasping at straws. Theory after theory to explain black failure. Role models. Black principals and administrators. Afro-centric studies. Free breakfasts and free lunches. Integration. Black charter schools (segregation on THEIR terms).</p>
<p>Nothing works in any combination.  </p>

		<p>Mom Penny Taylor, and afro black (see video), is act&rsquo;n all offended up en hee-ah, but that&rsquo;s just an old, successful voodoo trick used to fool gullible, sensitive, tolerant, inclusive, welcoming, and compassionate White Christians, especially our feminized males.  </p>
<p>Even the TV news producer played along with the trick, putting &#8220;furious over black student meeting&#8221; next to afro Penny&rsquo;s name on the video, thus reinforcing the deception.</p>
<p>Student afro Penny Golden, who straightens her wooly kink on her head to make it look less threatening to Whites, which is deceptive, played her part marvelously, complaining that she was &#8220;upset, thinking all black &#8216;people&rsquo; gotta be lower than a White kid.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The very chocolate black news girl also straightens her wooly kink, but in her case, given the width of her very Ghanan nose, it&rsquo;s really almost mandatory, given their her line of work broadcasts her straight into White homes all over South Ga. and North Fla.</p>
<p>Then the middle aged  White Father said the required mantra: &#8220;No, I don&rsquo;t want to see people getting separated, but everybody should be encouraged in whatever way it takes,&#8221; which means, we are all for Integration and Diversity, unlike our racist, hateful parents who picketed in favor of Segregation (https://www.ernie-jones.com/segregation.jpg) and just can&rsquo;t accept change and our historic first african american president,  and complain that the War Between the States Sesqui-Centennial is ruining the memory of Confederate valour and heroism my making everything Inclusive of the African American experience and perspective and feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever way it takes&#8221; is the afro Marvin Arrington way.  He&rsquo;s the afro Atlanta judge who kicked all  White Humanity out of his courtroom before he sternly  lectured the repeat afro offenders, because in the black community, as everybody is supposed to know and accommodate with &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221;, you just don&rsquo;t scold other blacks in front of the Whiteys.  Arrington got away with it. He made some sort of half apology, and was back in business. No investigation- no censure.  The National Association for the Advancement of White People stayed quiet, because they didn&rsquo;t want to be called &#8220;raciss&#8221;.  The Whiteys in the Atlanta Bar association stayed quiet, because they are smart survivalists, and they know you just don&rsquo;t offend blacks in Atlanta and expect to survive. </p>
<p>The White students weren&rsquo;t required to attend the mass meeting of blacks, because the school just can&rsquo;t afford for the Whites to see that the blacks as a mass are on the low end of the achievement gap, especially if that observation is made by the schools officials themselves.  It would hurt Tolerance if Whites  openly discuss that blacks are failing at six times the rate as Whites on the Math tests.  Those discussions among<br>
 Whites only foster a healthy desire for segregation, and that&rsquo;s not allowed. Nothing can be permitted that might spark negative connotations </p>
<p>&#8220;If you gonna have a meet&rsquo;n, why can&rsquo; you half it wif errybody? We half been segregated enough,&#8221; continued afro Penny.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the crux of the matter.  Afro Penny knows that while all the blacks were in the meeting, the White students temporarily were allowed to enjoy their life, liberty and pursuit of happiness while unsupervised by the Diversity Curse and they were free to feel the pleasantness that accompanies segregated Whites Only company of their peers and self-selected associates. The Whites got a taste of the good old days that grandma and grandpa talk about so fondly when Whites weren&rsquo;t forced to have Diversity Friends who spy on their every word and are ever ready to complain about racism, and when White cheerleaders weren&rsquo;t pressured into dating black athletes. </p>
<p>At the end of the report, the White Girl newscaster played her part in the deception by deflecting away from the fact of the meeting to asking about the content, and then we learned that &#8220;it was attended by a former african american mayor and successful african american businessmen, and it was a very good meeting that everybody would have benefited from, not  just the african americans in this school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, of course, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s spun.  Just like Whites seeing on TV all the time the black &#8220;role models&#8221; who have all the answers for the imbecilic Whites, even in real life the White students should be forced to endure these superior specimens of the Africa&rsquo;s Cradle of Humankind who reflect so marvelously upon the &#8220;community.&#8221;  Wouldn&rsquo;t you just love to audit the city books from that afro mayor&rsquo;s term in office and also audit how much state business these &#8220;successful&#8221; afro business men get from Affirmative Action Diversity Privilege set asides.</p>
<p>For every successful afro you see, there is a train of at least ten systemic and institutionally dispossessed Whites in their wake.  Blacks simply cannot advance unless Whites are made to suffer and pay for it.</p>
<p><br>
What will be the outcome of this story?  The blacks won&rsquo;t improve, but the Racial Achievement Gap will be narrowed, because the tests will get easier and the Whites will learn less, achieve less, and suffer from more and more of the torments of the Diversity Curse.</p>
<p>And at a minimum, they will be taught that they &#8220;must atone for our sins of the Achievement Gap and segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Effort to boost black test scores likened to &ldquo;segregation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The only way black test scores will be boosted is by bringing tests down to far lower levels and dumbing down the curriculum.</p>
<p>Constant black crying about black failure, blaming it on racism or oppression, makes blacks look like even bigger fools than they are, because everybody knows that poor non-black immigrants who come to this country outperform blacks in every aspect.</p>

		<p>If the black student thinks the meeting is insinuating that black students are behind, she should have to attend a teacher&rsquo;s in-service in any urban area. While she and her friends take the afternoon off, teachers are forced to listen to lectures and watch slide-shows about how to &#8220;help&#8221; blacks and then put into &#8220;working groups&#8221; to further discuss. Such nonsense!</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that time be better spent actually teaching the students instead of talking (all leftist opinion and jargon) <br>
about it?</p>

The school district said it held a series of meetings for only their black students to encourage them to do better in school.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the principal [of Ware County High School] became concerned over low test scores and wanted to invite black speakers to address them.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why there were only black businessmen and I assume an ex-mayor.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that if there had been a mixed white audience the message of &#8216;Look at us, we&rsquo;re all black, and we&rsquo;re success stories!&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have had equally racist overtones.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Princess Golden, a student who said she was required to be in the meeting, said she was shocked, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It kind of upset me because I&rsquo;m thinking, &lsquo;Are black people going to be lower than the white kids?&rsquo;&rdquo; Golden said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Young lady, if you have to compensate for such poor verbal skills by labelling yourself a &#8216;Princess&rsquo; then you have already put the perception ahead of the reality.</p>
<p>_And even your own kind knows it_ or they would never have agreed to participate.  Be glad that at least someone cares enough to push you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
According to the data [available online on the Georgia Department of Education&rsquo;s website], the latest numbers show that 12 percent of black students at Ware County High School failed the math portion of the Georgia High School Graduation test, and 16 percent failed the language arts portion. That compares to 2 percent of white students who failed the math portion and 4 percent who failed the language arts portion.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I would be more interested in consistent GPAs than test averages as the temptation to &#8216;test from the bottom&rsquo; of the curve never leaves the racial disparity gaming situation.  If it is in fact true, I am more worried about the white students than the blacks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
With a population of about 1,200 students, 40 percent are black at Ware County High School, and all of the black students had to go to the meeting.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Like I said, show me the total graduation rates and then the breakdown of GPAs.  That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to dictate the level of useful employment and job qualifications that that little burg can look forwards to.  And -national- grouping averages will in turn dictate the kind of society we &#8216;deserve&rsquo; to have as a function of high end professional skills.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to have a meeting, why can&rsquo;t you have that with everybody?&rdquo; Taylor [Penny Taylor, a parent of a student at Ware County High School] said. &ldquo;We have been segregated enough.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>How many parent teacher conferences did blacks actually attend when their children were in the age range 7-9?  That&rsquo;s the point to start working within the system.  By 17-19, everyone is basically functioning with adult level intellect and the most you can do is provide specialist training relative to overall mental abilities.</p>
<p>In this, it probably was a waste of time for all concerned.  As the people who are going to become babymakers and laborers vs. businessmen, scientists and leadership has long been set and for blacks, probably began three years earlier than whites with a commensurate loss of educational value as they hit puberty.</p>
<p>Kids are like sponges.  Soaking in everything around them.</p>
<p>Teenagers are like diamonds in the rough, compressing down all that they know for the moment when they can escape supervised day care and actually do something usefully independent.</p>
<p>Except for the low end of the curve.  For them, the transition from eager innocence to adulthood never includes the loss of dependency.</p>
<p>And I think THAT is the real fear here, without an obvious group-think (herd mindset) to reassure them that &#8216;everyone is exposed to the same risks and requirements&rsquo;, blacks are afraid of being on their own.</p>
<p>I was the same way when I was two.  Of course I had a good excuse in that there really were monsters in my closet.  My heartless parents &#8216;segregated me&rsquo;* anyway and I learned not to be afraid to sleep in my own bed.  A couple years later, I actually learned to help make it too.</p>
<p>*From the Latin- segre: to separate + gare: herd/flock i.e. to &#8216;separate the flock&rsquo; a religious connotation of dividing the godly from the sinners having NOTHING to do with race&hellip;</p>

		<p>11- great analysis.</p>
<p>We need to dissect all these race stories in the terms you have presented.</p>
<p>Always look for the subtle message that is pro-Integration, which is code for White Misery.</p>
<p>Whatever the take is on the story, the main point will be that &#8220;we just can&rsquo;t afford for White students to be left alone to enjoy themselves and develop White Identities. We must surround them with Diversity so that we can monitor them for racism and prejudice.  If they keep quiet, then we won&rsquo;t have as many obstacles to overcome in the future.  If they speak up, we can mau mau the administration to &#8216;do more&rsquo; to combat racism, which gives us power and jobs.  Either way, we can&rsquo;t lose, as long as we make sure that Whites aren&rsquo;t allowed to self-select their companions. The only identity we will allow them is one that includes Diversity as their obligation.&#8221;</p>
<p>How much longer can this vile, toxic, hate last?  As long as the money lasts, but when it&rsquo;s gone, we return to obeying our elemental instincts and the iron laws of nature.   The blacks are already there, and the Whites, in this one case, could benefit from black &#8220;role models&#8221;.<br>

		<p>in my opinion such meetings and unusual measures to somehow get black kids to lift their test scores to equal whites and asians is futile. In the classroom the teachers don&rsquo;t have the same expectations for black kids that they have for other kids. black kids have done themselves a bad turn by their inability to engage the material presented. </p>

		<p>Black students, especially the males, need the help.  Although the students all attend the same school, they come from very different cultures which began dramatically diverging now three generations ago. Only now is learning and intellectual achievement despised in the Black community. Back in the day, there was great respect from Blacks  for those Blacks, however few, who had worked they way up from ignorance and poverty. Now such virtue is derided as &#8216;acting white&rsquo;. Culture and values drive all achievement.  We may be constrained by our genetic heritage, but we are imprisoned by it. Effort can overcome disadvantage - we has seen this repeatedly in our country.  I only fear these separate classes will focus on self esteem rather than self-discipline.</p>

		<p>I am more concerned about this test: 12% of black kids and 2% of white kids flunked the math portion?  Am I the only one who is very suspicious of this test?  In theory passing this test means that you have a High School education.  Sorry but I am not buying for one single second that 98% of white kids and 88% of black kids can do 12th grade math.  20 bucks says this test goes about as high as 6th grade math.  If that is the case, then I think we should be mainly upset about the paper that is wasted every time a &#8220;student&#8221; has to take this test.  </p>

		<p>To poster #14, I suffer through these meetings WEEKLY!  The older teachers (30+) who remember America as it was just roll their eyes and wink at each other.</p>
<p>Some would say that this is a symptom of older teachers having &#8216;low expectations&rsquo; of their students, thus necessitating their firing in favor of perky young Teach for America graduates who will turn education around, yet NO TFA greenhorn I have ever met remains unjaded for more than a year.  They get just as cynical as the rest of us, by and large.</p>
