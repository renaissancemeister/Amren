<h1>Number of Illegal Immigrants in US Now Declining</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Google News, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has dropped for the first time in 20 years as substantially fewer undocumented workers from Mexico, Latin America and elsewhere are crossing the border in search of jobs, an independent research group says.</p>
<p>The analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center suggests the nation&rsquo;s economic downturn and increased border enforcement have reduced the number of illegal immigrants, who make up roughly 4 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study released Wednesday estimates that 11.1 million illegal immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2009. That represents a decrease of roughly 1 million, or 8 percent, from a peak of 12 million in 2007, before Arizona intervened with its new enforcement measures.</p>
<p>The study, based on an analysis of 2009 census data, puts the number of illegal immigrants about where it was in 2005.</p>
<p>The 11.1 million is slightly higher than the Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s own estimate of 10.8 million. The government uses a different census survey that makes some year-to-year comparisons difficult.</p>
<p>Much of the recent decrease comes from a sharp drop-off in illegal immigrants attempting to cross the border into the U.S., particularly those from the Caribbean, Central America and South America. An increase in unauthorized immigrants leaving the U.S., by deportation or for economic reasons, also may have played a factor.</p>
<p>States in the Southeast and Southwest saw some of the biggest declines in the number of illegal immigrants from 2008 to 2009, including Florida, Nevada and Virginia. Arizona saw a decrease, but it was too small to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to figure out how much of the decline to attribute to the bad economy and how much to immigration enforcement, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew who co-wrote the analysis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other Pew findings:</p>
<p>* The states with the highest percentage of illegal immigrants were California (6.9 percent), Nevada (6.8 percent), Texas (6.5 percent) and Arizona (5.8 percent). The numbers are expected to play an important factor in whether those states lose or gain fewer U.S. House seats than expected after the 2010 census.</p>
<p>* Illegal immigrants make up about 28 percent of the foreign-born population in the U.S., down from 31 percent in 2007.</p>
<p>* The unemployment rate for illegal immigrants in March 2009 was 10.4 percent  &mdash;  higher than that of U.S.-born workers or legal immigrants, who had unemployment of 9.2 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively.</p>

		<p>So much for the Prevailing Wisdom that states that we have to give the illegals amnesty, since we can&rsquo;t send them all back.<br>
Let&rsquo;s get tougher on the border, tougher on employers, and tougher with deportations. Then we&rsquo;ll see even greater progress.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve used the same old number of 12 million for years, and now it&rsquo;s supposedly dropped. I don&rsquo;t believe a thing the media or government says. Just take a look around where you live, are there any less here than previously? Check the school enrollments, hospital emergency rooms, hispanic neighborhoods, and so on. What do you see? It&rsquo;s just like the news in the previous communist countries. They would trumpet that production was up by such and such percent, but citizens would never see it in person. They knew it was bogus. But here people seem to swallow the official line over and over. Dishonesty prevails; rely on what your eyes tell you.    </p>

		<p>A word to the wise:</p>
<p>There are NOT 11.1 million illegals in this country.  The number stated in this article is vastly understated.  It is most likely more than 25 million.  When you&rsquo;ve traveled in different states and seen that the number of what appear to be Mexicans and other types of Hispanics from Central America almost outnumber the number of Blacks, one can tell that there&rsquo;s an agenda behind this.  When it&rsquo;s stated that, &#8220;The number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has dropped for the first time in 20 years&#8221;, it can be quite misleading.  &#8216;Many people will read this and think that &#8220;Oh wow there&rsquo;s less illegals here now than 20 years ago&rsquo;!, when in fact it only means that the number has dropped from what was here last year - 9 months ago - so we still have about 25 million of them here!!, if this is really true, and I don&rsquo;t believe that it is.  I think it&rsquo;s just an attempt to lull us into a false sense of security while we&rsquo;re being taken over little by little and our society is taken apart piece by piece.</p>

		<p>Should I point out the elephant in the room here and say that unemployment among illegals should be 100% since they are not supposed to be here at all, much less work here? Hunt down these employers and fine them 10,000 for each illegal they have on the payroll, and in no time at all, we WOULD see and unemployment rate of 100%. But that just makes too much sense.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the article is correct about having less immigrants here, but the reduction is so small it&rsquo;s almost insignificant.  If it keeps up, however, it could make a pretty sizeable dent in the illegal population.</p>
<p>Something else could occur that would send them back home:  The greatest depression right along with large scale hostilities against a weakened government and also along racial lines.</p>
<p>And both events have moved beyond the realm of possibility and are now very likely to occur. </p>

<p>So, we are to assume that the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; were thrown off balance by: a state with only about a 3.5 million &ldquo;white non-Hispanics&rdquo; in it; a few laws in that state, dealing with the reality of the &ldquo;undocumented;&rdquo; and of course, a bad economy?</p>
<p>Well, how come the &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; are leaving? How is it that this group of tens of millions of &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; have not decided to encamp in a lettuce patch and save the country (our country,) that they supposedly &ldquo;love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it really about being &ldquo;undocumented,&rdquo; or simply about being ungrateful and uninvited, and abysmally unneeded?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I have to agree with all the posters who say the figure of 12 million is a lie, and who say the decrease is also a lie.  </p>
<p>Where I live (northeast coast), there are so many hispanics it looks like mexico.  I mean, you can drive for block after block and you see nothing but the faces of illiterate peasant farmers who came here to be busboys and lawnmower guys.  This phenomenon extends into EVERY small town and suburb within driving distance.</p>
<p>Sometimes after passing a full day and seeing 95% latinos everywhere I go, sometimes 100%, I just shake my head in wonderment and say, &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in a small island of orientals, who hire illegal mexicans for every menial task.  There are more and more latinos everyday.  They can&rsquo;t all be here legally.  Aren&rsquo;t there some standards a person has to pass to get here legally?  Maybe that&rsquo;s changing too.</p>

		<p>More and more LIES!  The 12 million figure has been around for at least 15 years! There is more than 40 million if not more!  Plus NONE of them are leaving the US! They just go to different States and they keep coming across the border at 10,000 a DAY from what I read a year or so ago! </p>

		<p>You cannot tell the number of illegals in the country.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t possible to count under our current system of law (note that laws&hellip;..change).</p>
<p>What you can count however is the number of elected officials who want to get rid of mexicans.  That is most certainly a number that can be counted, tracked, and then tapped.</p>
<p>That number is vastly on the rise.  NumbersUSA does a great job of identifying these people in great detail.  VOTE FOR THEM!</p>
<p>Many feel that there is no political solution (many who say as much are actually agents who work for the communists that pull Obama&rsquo;s strings hoping to trick you into apathy).  But the truth is, the time has not yet come to stop oiling our guns and start going out on patrol with the local militia.  Things are well within the, still political arena.  And engaging these new anti-immigrant politicians and using the rule of law to get rid of the mexicans is the way to go&hellip;..for now.</p>
<p>You will know when that is no longer the case, btw.  You will know because your state governor will call on you for volunteer service (or will demonize the 90% of state governors doing this&hellip;.if you are stupid enough to still live in the wrong states).</p>
<p>Things are sooooo much still within the realm of political solution that none other than David Duke is throwing his hat into the ring for President this election cycle.  Why?  Does he feel the need to piss away millions of dollars while being vilified as the reincarnation of Hitler?</p>
<p>No dummies&hellip;..he is doing it because he has a good chance of WINNING.</p>

		<p>I live in Los Angeles and I&rsquo;d estimate there are 12 million in California alone, but liberals love to create a muddle - there are anchor babies, mixed families, amnesty recipients, illegals allowed to stay while their paperwork is processed, etc.  Citizens who haven&rsquo;t been lobotomized yet rightfully want ALL of them deported or otherwise forced to leave, and the number of hispanics who would be staying would be vanishingly small.  I don&rsquo;t consider the children born to those who received the 1986 amnesty to be citizens, or their children either.  It&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re leeches (blacks win that crown), but this is our country, our culture&hellip;even if they were asians that I generally admire, this remains our land.</p>

		<p>  &mdash;  The analysis by the Pew HISPANIC Center.</p>
<p>A &#8216;Center&rsquo; with &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; as part of its name wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit biased, would it?</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  11.1 million illegal immigrants lived in the U.S. in 2009. That represents a decrease of roughly 1 million, or 8 percent, from a peak of 12 million in 2007</p>
<p>Oh wow, is this supposed to make me feel better?  That still leaves 11 million (probably more like 25 million) fecund welfare parasites to leech off of White taxpayers.</p>
<p>I believe these figures are being released to lull us &#8216;agitated&rsquo; Whites into believing that illegal immigration is no longer a problem (to the government and media it never was a problem).  </p>
<p>This is a run-up to the elections in November, expect more of same  &mdash;  press releases from the government/media as to &#8216;improving conditions&rsquo; in the US, reports from krugman et al. that the economy is &#8216;surging&rsquo; and the &#8216;dollar strong&rsquo;, unemployment rates dropping and jobs created due to the stimulus, illegal immigrants heading home freeing up jobs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe any of it.</p>
<p>You can be sure the current regime will lie and twist the truth, do anything, to hang on to their power.  Those in control of our government are devotees of Saul Alinsky and his Rules for Radicals.  Expect a full assault with Rules 3 and 10 used to excess:</p>
<p>Rule #3:  In war (and politics is war) the end justifies almost any means.</p>
<p>Rule #10:   Do what you can with what you have and clothe it with moral garments</p>
<p>The government is reading the &#8216;handwriting on the walls&rsquo; and interpreting the &#8216;tea leaves&rsquo; and realizes it must placate the angry White Supremacists, Glen Beck-loving Tea Parties BEFORE the Nov. elections.</p>
<p>On a good note, finally, in Alaska,  Joe Miller has won after Lisa Murkowski conceded.  Sen. Murkowski voted in favor of the 2007 mass amnesty bill on the initial cloture vote, earning a grade of C- from NumbersUSA.</p>
<p>Good Riddance.</p>
<p>Now, if we Californians can get boxer out of office&hellip;.</p>

If true, it&rsquo;s only a temporary reprieve.</p>
<p>When the economy turns around, they&rsquo;re going to redouble their efforts to make up for all the criminal aliens that jumped ship when the economy tanked.</p>

<p>This is absolutely correct. The figures are much higher? I suspect too as well. Hell, just about anyone on this forum suspects the same. Our eyes do not lie.</p>
<p>That figure of 11 million has been bandied about for years now. Unchanging.</p>
<p>At least 20 million estimated from remittances. Probably greater than that.</p>
<p>We were told only 1 million in the amnesty of 1984. It was in actuality 3 million.</p>

		<p>Statistics on illegal Asian immigrants are a total mystery.  Have you noticed how the media always withholds information about Asians in news reports with comparisons to other races?  Anyway, the numbers the Pew Center use are vastly underestimated.  They do that on purpose not to scare the public so the illegal immigration problem can continue.  The real number of illegal immigrants in the US are around 25 million.</p>

		<p>These lower population figures for illegal immigrants are just part of a disinformation campaign to pave the way for an amnesty bill.  Therefore, the average person and politicans will believe the illegals are a smaller and declining population so why not legalize them???</p>
<p>The reality is that the number of illegals is probably around 20 million with a greater diversity of illegals than the government will admit.  For example their are waves and waves of Chinese, Indians and other Asians coming illegally to the United States or overstaying their visas.  If an amnesty bill passes people will be amazed at how many non-hispanics will be applying for legalization.</p>

		<p>One night on one of the MSM stations they slipped and put up the estimate of the number of illegal immigrants, 12 million, and the year for those data. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact year, but I believe it was about 10-12 years ago. I remember thinking,damn,  this is same number that has been thrown about for years now.Of course, it was just a quick glimpse and I never saw it again.</p>
<p>Anyway, you don&rsquo;t need government numbers. All you have to do is walk through your local supermarket, take a walk down the street. And it&rsquo;s not just Mexicans. It&rsquo;s Asians, women with head scarves in the medical clinics, Arabs behind the counters in convenience stores. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a transplant to the South, but I have to say, Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis must be rolling over in their graves. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the South was right.  </p>

<p>   MANDATORY 2 year jail term for perjury (on their w-4 work forms)</p>

		<p>1. By definition, such census is unreliable. These people don&rsquo;t talk to pollsters. Look around suburbs circling major metro areas. Think you see more Hispanics, Chinese and Salvadorans?<br>
Some are legal, green card if not citizens, but quotas and reunifications of families haven&rsquo;t risen as much as the influx observed easily in schools, jobs and sidewalks. Who knows how many? Too many.</p>
<p>2.  I have reached the conclusion that the problem is immigration period. It&rsquo;s not the fence. It&rsquo;s not what Arizona was trying to do by picking them off arrest or traffic stop by traffic stop. It the massive legal amounts of Africans and Indians in &#8220;IT&#8221; in national security contractor rich MD, VA and DC. It&rsquo;s the takeover by what&rsquo;s left of blue collar employment and agricultural labor by Somalis, Paks and Arabs. It&rsquo;s the destruction of American public schools as incubators of our culture by millions of kids with names that should be banned in an Anglo-Saxon/Germanic based culture which is what we are supporsed to be.</p>
<p>3. Stop all immigration now. It all should be illegal. I hate the concept of biometric ID cards but if that is what it takes,so be it, along with drastic penalties against employers who hire non-citizens(get rid of legal residency and green cards). We also need  a massive campaign to reverse the Supreme Court decisions allowing illegals in our schools and automatic birth citizens who are children of illegals. Don&rsquo;t listen to the lies: our economy does not need these immigrants, legal or not,and our culture has been degraded, possibly beyond repair, by them.</p>

		<p>The feds and MSM are liars. I wouldn&rsquo;t believe them if they told me the earth was round. If they say there are 11 million illegals in the country and one million are leaving every year, then the truth is that there are probably thirty million in the country with a million ARRIVING every year.</p>
<p>But even if their numbers are accurate, the population of illegals would keep growing due to natural reproduction. One million leave. Two million babies are born. The population keeps rising.</p>
<p>And I love that statistic about how the illegals have an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent  &mdash;  higher than US-born workers. What a laugh. The real unemployment rate is at least 18 per cent right now, if not higher, partly because of outsourcing and the replacement of US workers with cheap illegal labor. </p>
<p>The numbers spewing out of the government and media are meaningless. This is all propaganda designed to keep the passengers in steerage calm while the ship goes down and the ruling elites bail out in their life boats.</p>

		<p>I should add that like another person who posted above, I also live in Los Angeles. It is no exaggeration to say that there are 12 million illegals in the Los Angeles / Long Beach metropolitan area alone. There is no decline in illegals. None. The powers that be, the powers that pull Obama&rsquo;s puppet strings want even more. They also want to grant amnesty asap. Presto! No more illegals. Full scale warfare against whites, yet most whites still aren&rsquo;t aware of it. But more and more are coming around. Thanks to the behavior of the people the self proclaimed elites are moving into the US and the rest of the West. </p>
