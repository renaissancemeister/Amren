<h1>Audit Finds Sharpton&rsquo;s Nonprofit on Brink</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carl Campanile, New York Post, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An accounting firm hired by Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network found the civil-rights group in such financial disarray that it flunked its record-keeping  &mdash;  and may not even survive, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>The scathing critique was spelled out in a hard-hitting internal audit of NAN&rsquo;s books, a copy of which was obtained by The Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;The organization has suffered recurring decreases in net assets  &mdash;  and has been dependent upon advances from related parties and the nonpayment of payroll tax obligations  &mdash;  to maintain continuity,&#8221; the firm KBL concluded in an April 2 audit of NAN&rsquo;s 2008 financial records, the most recent available.</p>
<p>The audit, which was submitted to NAN&rsquo;s board of directors, warned, &#8220;These circumstances create substantial doubt about the organization&rsquo;s ability to continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>KBL said it was &#8220;unable to form an opinion&#8221; on the accuracy of NAN&rsquo;s financial figures &#8220;because of inadequacies in the organization&rsquo;s accounting records.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2008, federal prosecutors decided to drop a criminal probe into the finances of Sharpton and NAN. But Sharpton  &mdash;  who also has a lucrative syndicated radio show and a speech-making and consulting business  &mdash;  agreed to pay back more than $2 million in overdue personal and NAN taxes.</p>
<p>The audit said NAN still owed $1.348 million in delinquent city, state and federal taxes and penalties at the end of 2008. {snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the Federal Elections Commission slapped Sharpton with $285,000 fine, in part for illegally using NAN funds to cover the costs of his 2004 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the audit found that NAN was a defendant in five lawsuits:</p>
<p>* Alpha International Travel accused the group of failing to pay $50,000 in outstanding bills. NAN settled the case.</p>
<p>* The Peabody hotel in Memphis, where NAN held its 2008 convention, accused NAN of stiffing it out of $70,000. NAN is contesting the charges.</p>
<p>* NAN&rsquo;s Arizona chapter is accused of being a deadbeat tenant. The organization is fighting the claim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Far from closing shop, Sharpton has opened new NAN chapters across the country the past two years.</p>
<p>But such an expansion is a costly mistake, said one insider familiar with the group&rsquo;s finances.</p>

		<p>I can ill imagine the NAN chapter in Arizona being that successful.  AZ has very few blacks.  Tucson more so than Phoenix, but not too many in either case.  They might think they had a chance with Hispanics b/c of Sharpton&rsquo;s involvement in the SB 1070 issue, but black-Hispanic animosity trumps that.</p>
<p>BTW, I used to think that there was no such thing as an affirmative action program for tax evasion   &mdash;   From what I read, the Feds would throw black people in Federal prison just as quick and for just as long as they would throw white people in for violation the same tax laws and regs and involving the same amount of money.  However, it says here that the auditors found that the NAN has only survived b/c they&rsquo;re stiffing the Feds on payroll taxes.  Where&rsquo;s the IRS?  I suppose Sharpton is too big a fish for Obama&rsquo;s IRS to reel in.  Meaning my theory was wrong.</p>

<p><br>
Al&rsquo;s typical black behavior confirms and permits our instinctive and immediate revulsion and disgust at blacks.  </p>
<p>Hinton Rowan Helper chronicled these immediate manifestations in his important and courageous Africans in Africaland.  It&rsquo;s an AmRen Community must read, along with Revilo Oliver, Savitri Devi, and William Gayley Simpson, and of course, Carlton Putnam and Jared Taylor.  For high-toned White elevation, visit <a href="https://cambriawillnotyield.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://cambriawillnotyield.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>It must be said many different ways: black behavior justifies White bigotry, prejudice, and unmitigated racism.  Segregation was necessary.  Integration is White genocide.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t invent racism as an abstraction- it only become manifest when White Humanity has contact with blacks, and if a White doesn&rsquo;t feel disgust rising up in his being just at the sight of Al, and especially with this news of Al&rsquo;s immorality, then we reject your membership.</p>
<p>White Humanity is the moral agent of the iron laws of nature. Ethical racism is a healthy defense against getting taken, scammed, robbed, raped, and murdered by the Africans whom we haven&rsquo;t yet sent back home to Africa.</p>
<p>God wrote race prejudice onto our hearts with his own finger. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d rather be the living raciss who stays away from blacks than the dead anti-raciss who just couldn&rsquo;t get himself surrounded by enough African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obey God- Transcend Diversity- Embrace Whiteness Only!</p>
<p>We owe them nothing but contempt and a boat ride back to Ghana.</p>

<p><br>
What an interesting statement.  I wonder how many &#8220;related parties&#8221; are also bankrupt.  In other words, no longer able to advance a sick anti-white agenda because all the money that would have been used for that was stolen to buy gold rims, cocaine and prostitutes.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip;.very interesting.</p>

		<p>Any surprises here?  Favorite Al story is Al being filmed in a dope transaction, fat Al with a rumpled cowboy hat (straw as I remember), busted.</p>
<p>The news network (I forget which of the big three), showed it a few times and then was threatened with violence and lawsuits, they capitualted to Al and his ilk.</p>
<p>Any surprises?  Al has more to come, I assure you.</p>

		<p>I read elsewhere today that Sharpton stays in hotel rooms at rates in excess of a thousand bucks per night.  This is affordable housing at its best. Well, at least these high end hotels achieve some diversity. </p>
