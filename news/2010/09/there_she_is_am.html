<h1><a href="https://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39284368/ns/today-today_fashion_and_beauty/">There She Is, America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen  &mdash;  From Britain?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Inbar, MSNBC, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At first blush, it&rsquo;s a familiar story: A small-town girl beats the odds to win fame and fortune at a beauty pageant. But the twist is that the small town of Anysha Panesar, newly crowned America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen, is not in America at all  &mdash;  and that has some folks up in arms.</p>
<p>Anysha, 16, hails from Llangan, Wales  &mdash;  some 3,500 miles from U.S. shores. While on a family vacation in Kissimmee, Fla., last month, she entered the America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen pageant on a whim. But lo and behold, when the winner was announced, she was the last young woman standing among 30 contestants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t think I would actually win because I&rsquo;m British, so I thought there was no chance I was going to win an American pageant,&#8221; Panesar told the London Daily Mail newspaper.</p>
<p>But some pageant teens&rsquo; parents not only didn&rsquo;t believe Panesar would win; they believe she shouldn&rsquo;t have. They were shocked to learn that the pageant has no U.S. residency requirement, and have taken it up with pageant officials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Riches-to-riches story</b></p>
<p>To be sure, Anysha&rsquo;s tale is far from a rags-to-riches story  &mdash;  in fact, the $2,000 in cash and $18,000 in scholarship money may seem like small change to her family. Her well-heeled parents send her to the same elite private school in Cardiff, Wales, that chart-topping singer Charlotte Church attended. And they splashed out nearly six figures to throw Anysha&rsquo;s Moulin Rouge-themed birthday party last year  &mdash;  a bash so lavish it was featured on MTV&rsquo;s &#8220;My Super Sweet 16&#8221; reality series.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even before entering the America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen competition, the attractive teen was no stranger to beauty pageants. Her proud mother says Anysha has already been crowned Miss Teen Wales and won a modeling competition back home, and had even entered American pageants before, placing runner-up once.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, NBC&rsquo;s Kosinski asked Galanes a question likely on many people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an American teen can&rsquo;t win America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen  &mdash;  what&rsquo;s to become of this nation, Michael?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Best week of my life&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And while Panesar said she is aware of some complaints that a British girl claimed the America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen crown, she sees it more of a case of the agony of defeat than bias. {snip}</p>
<p>Besides, Panesar believes the more apt title should be World&rsquo;s Perfect Teen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the pageant now needs to expand internationally, in my opinion, because I believe that it&rsquo;s such a great opportunity for so many girls around the world,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>An attractive girl!   But only sixteen?  She doesn&rsquo;t look like any mere teenager. Not like any devout Moslem either. I wonder what her ancestry is&hellip;perhaps half British, half Indian?</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect they will change the name of the pageant first. Florida/Disneyland makes too much money off foreign tourists, of which there are a great many.  It won&rsquo;t want to offend them.</p>

		<p>WOW!  That&rsquo;s one mature-looking teenager!<br>
But to the point, she believes that people are simply jealous that she won, and not upset because she was &#8220;British&#8221; (another undeserved title) in an American pageant.  What attitude!</p>

		<p>She is of Indian origin.</p>
<p>She is not only supposed to be American, but she is from the UK.  That isn&rsquo;t so bad, but she&rsquo;s not British.  She&rsquo;s Indian.  The whole idea is &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and the relentless spreading of it.  Separate us from our roots, culture, heritage, traditions, etc. and we&rsquo;re supposed to celebrate with multicultural joy.  Oh isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that an Indian teen from Britain is &#8220;America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen&#8221;.  Oh I&rsquo;m so happy!  Aren&rsquo;t you?!</p>

		<p>Her name sounds Indian.  While she is pretty, no doubt, I would think that if the pageant was for &#8220;American&#8221; then residency should be a requirement.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a &#8220;Ms. China&#8221; contest and a girl visiting from Peru enters and wins it?  It would never happen.</p>

		<p>Certainly a beautiful woman, of any age, though I suspect she is not Indian but considering England is overun by Pakistani muslims I would bet her parents (therefore SHE) is Pakistani and muslim. Would that all the muslims looked like her and had the same attitude&hellip;but alas! not gonna happen.</p>

		<p>An Indian (or Arab or Persian or whatever) from Wales winning the Miss Perfect Teen contest is the perfect metaphor for multiculturalism and globalism. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, that this is the second Arab/Indian/etc. to win an American beauty pageant this year? (remember who won Miss America?). To be fair, however, she certainly deserves the title if it is to be based on beauty alone, and, like Miss America, she doesn&rsquo;t look like a minority at all. If it weren&rsquo;t for her surname, one would think she were white.</p>

<p>The whole thing seems suspect to me, especially since this wasn&rsquo;t the first time she competed in the U.S. </p>

		<p>No Indian can be British!  Neither can an African, Mexican, Arab, or any other race except those of the White race.</p>
<p> This is just part of the agenda to condition Whites to even be more accepting of the multicult agenda to displace Whites from their own homelands. Much like they are doing here in the USA.</p>

		<p>Aw c&rsquo;mon guys. She doesn&rsquo;t particularly look non- white. If she&rsquo;s half Indian so what? Aren&rsquo;t Indians actually classified as Caucasians.<br>

		<p>Her mothers name is Caroline Panesar. Looking around the net, I found suggestions that her mother may be Dutch.  But couldn&rsquo;t confirm it.</p>
<p>So she is Brit Indian/ Dutch ???.  Reportedly her family is quote &#8216;mega-rich&rsquo;.  Take that for what its worth.  </p>
<p>Running the girls name shows that she is the current Miss Euro Teen something or another.  She has been making scheduled appearances as Miss Euro Teen.  I don&rsquo;t see how she can make the Euro Teen schedule at the same time she has a schedule as Miss Americas Perfect Teen.  Can&rsquo;t be in two places at once.</p>
<p>Maybe she can show us how that is done.</p>

		<p>The facial structure and general appearance scream that she is not anything to do with the indigenous peoples of England,Ireland,Scotland or WALES,one can lighten the skin,but the skull bones remain the same as its forbears,theytry all of the time to insinuate these foreigners into our societies through television and media,but one look is enough to be sure that this is not one of your own.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s all that good looking. </p>
<p>1. Her hair is just awful. nothing nice about it. <br>
2. Her eyeliner is so heavy it&rsquo;s kinda gross<br>
3. Her eyebrows are plucked so unnaturally she looks like she&rsquo;s frighted <br>
4. Her chin doesn&rsquo;t appear to fall on the center line of her nose. But to be honest that could be bad lighting it&rsquo;s hard to tell with her awkward pose.<br>
5. lips are too fat for me.<br>
6. legs to skinny</p>
<p>I can admire the beauty of nonwhite women. There are lots of nonwhite women I find generally attractive. Although White women are the best looking if you ask me. It&rsquo;s not her race it&rsquo;s just her.  </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s neither Welsh nor British as a matter of fact <br>
as with a person of White European ancestry born in India, not being Indian either.  </p>
<p>In the photo above, her skin is considerably lighter creating the impression she&rsquo;s 50% white.  On googling her background, however, it&rsquo;s clear she&rsquo;s indeed full brown-skinned thus much darker than the photo above depicts.  I reckon the above photo has been edited in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Her selection as America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen, is an out-and-out insult to real Americans.  </p>
<p>No doubt, your average African-American will object to the winning choice too for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>It seems, it was originally her mother who passed the comment about other contestants being jealous.  What else would one expect from a non-White alien or race mixer!!!</p>
<p>In the meantime, all White people can do is to remain alert and vigilant whilst doing their collective bit to reeducate those of the brainwashed White masses out there most particulary, the young. </p>

		<p>I saw other photos of her, and she looks Caucasian to me.</p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s only half-white, who should care?  Like Obama is black, but only half black, this lady MIGHT be only half white, but she&rsquo;s white, and again like Obama, what you are perceived as is what you are.</p>

		<p>#8&hellip; &#8220;she is the current Miss Euro Teen something or another. She has been making scheduled appearances as Miss Euro Teen. I don&rsquo;t see how she can make the Euro Teen schedule at the same time she has a schedule as Miss Americas Perfect Teen.&#8221;  <br>
&#8220;I found suggestions that her mother may be Dutch. So she is Brit Indian/ Dutch ???&#8221; </p>
<p>#13&hellip;<i>&#8220;The whole thing seems suspect to me, especially since this wasn&rsquo;t the first time she competed in the U.S. <br>
I don&rsquo;t believe she &ldquo;entered on a whim&rdquo;, but that the outcome was planned. <br>
________________</i></p>
<p>Very interesting. Yes, she could indeed by half Indian, half Dutch. The Dutch side would explain the European look.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the family has been very consciously entering her in contests, wherever there is one. Nor do I believe that she &#8220;just happened&#8221; to be in Florida at the time.Is she making a business of this?  Is there prize money involved in these contests she&rsquo;s been winning?  This could be just a clever business scheme that they&rsquo;re running.  (And I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s still a sweet sixteen either!  The contest ought to check her out more thoroughly.  She&rsquo;s more like 24, I&rsquo;d say. At the least.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that she has the money to be flying around to enter these different contests in other countries.  So her family is super rich (they tell us). Oh, really?  I&rsquo;d like to know what her family&rsquo;s money  comes from.  Odd that they don&rsquo;t mention it.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s just an innocent girl who won some inane beauty contest. I doubt she&rsquo;s a rapist or murder&hellip;unfornately, white countries allow millions of violent criminals from non-white third world countries every year. I worry more about the horrifying immigration situation&hellip;some useless beauty contest is not a major concern.</p>

		<p>At least she will never be Miss America. She would have to be a US citizen to enter any Miss America preliminary.</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s okay to allow non whites into our countries as long as they are attractive women?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of &#8220;thinking&#8221; that lead to Latin America being the way it is.  <br>

		<p>I guess I&rsquo;m old fashion. When I think of the America&rsquo;s Perfect Teen, I think of the girl next door type.  The type that has a fresh look to her face, a  certain look of modesty and innocence, no longer a child, but still not a women.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the song &ldquo;Young Girl by Gary Puckett &amp; the Union Gap&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;With all the charms of a woman &hellip;You&rsquo;ve kept the secret of your youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I look at Anysha Panesar, I see the face of a harden professional. Look at the way she poses, her skirt up to her butt, her legs spread open.  No modesty, no innocence at all. She left her teen age years long ago, if she ever had any at all.<br>

		<p>In the &#8220;bad&#8221; old days of the Raj she would have been described as Eurasian.Physically she is more west-asian in appearance,culturally she is definitely western.Panesar is a Punjabi name and the asian side of her lineage is more likely Sikh than muslim,which would account for her relaxed attitude. <br>
Just to put the record straight the Welsh are the people the Romans conquered in 43AD,and it is they and not the English(who arrived four centuries later) who were first dubbed the &#8220;British&#8221;.This seems to confuse most Americans.</p>
