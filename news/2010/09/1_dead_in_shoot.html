<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>D.C. police have arrested a man on charges of first-degree murder in connection with a shooting and accident that killed a person in northwest Washington.</p>
<p>D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier says 21-year-old Brandon Miller was arrested about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and will likely be arraigned Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FOX 5 has learned that 21-year-old Jamal Coates was killed after a shooting and subsequent car crash near a funeral for a young woman who was recently shot to death.</p>
<p>A cousin of Coates said he had attended the funeral of 21-year-old Ashley McCrae, who was shot Sept. 18 in southeast D.C. McRae was found shot in her car in the 2700 block of Bruce Place. She died later at the hospital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shooting broke out about 12:30 p.m. Tuesday near the Walker Memorial Baptist Church at 2020 13th Street NW.</p>
<p>Two others were injured during the shooting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sources tell FOX 5&rsquo;s Paul Wagner that two rival gangs had been friendly with McRae and both wanted to attend the funeral.</p>
<p>D.C. Council member Jim Graham, who represents the U Street area, says the shooting was gang related. He said Tuesday that he was told the shooting was the result of &#8220;the continuing feud between two rival gangs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham said that one gang was apparently at a funeral in the area when the other gang showed up.</p>
<p>He said one gang apparently was &#8220;taunting&#8221; the other, leading to the shooting.</p>

		<p>Numbers of funeral homes in the Chi area refuse to do funerals for gang bangers. Too much danger for everyone. The insurance could NEVER cover the damage done from a drive by. Intimidation from rival gangsters is terrible on the funeral home director.</p>
<p>The directors themselves are in mortal danger.</p>
<p>The estates of some deceased gang bangers have sued the funeral homes for refusing to do the wakes.</p>

		<p>I never knew it was proper etiquette to carry a fireman when attending a funeral.  I guess that&rsquo;s why Brooks Brothers suits have the inside pocket.</p>

		<p>Why should this barbaric behavior surprise anyone at this point? I&rsquo;m disgusted - but not surprised. Blacks are often unaware of their surroundings or any cultural context that drives the behavior of civilized people. It&rsquo;s a miracle more people weren&rsquo;t killed in DC.</p>
<p>Various aggregator sites which collect articles from across the nation show that such senseless violence is a common occurrence in black areas. The MSM isolates the stories so to the casual (and often clueless) white observer the primitive violence of the perps is taken as isolated or random. </p>
<p>But more and more the thread, the connections, are apparent. </p>
<p>The real question is what to do now that we know what the larger picture entails. </p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m unclear on the solution. Short of mass incarceration - which is not a viable option at present - it would seem wisest to buy some time by keeping the dangerous animals in defined zones. </p>
<p>Whites only enable this behavior by always running to the rescue, so to speak, and by providing lavish government giveaways. This allows blacks to create more problems in their damaged communities since there is no need to work. There is no value or pride when everything from housing to child care is given out based just on skin color. </p>
<p>Until a major crackdown backed by legal measures can be instituted it would seem best to let them simply destroy each other while continuously stripping away the handouts. When no one comes to scoop them off the streets and they have to work (or at the very least behave) if they want to put food in their mouths you might see a change.</p>
<p>Also, whites should not be fearful of the numbers. Blacks constitute less than 15 percent of the population. Whites are still the overall majority. If necessary, in the future, when desperate measures may be required, just remember the South Africa of old. A tiny percentage of whites were able to control a huge majority of millions of blacks and keep themselves free from the sub-human problems of that race. It could easily be done again. </p>
<p>Besides, in many ways, despite the so-called civil rights movement, blacks are generally locked down in specific zones in America today (remember the racial map from last week). Although one has to play the PC game I believe that there is an unspoken agreement among many whites, out of simple necessity, that blacks can only go so far in destroying this nation. A stand will be taken if attempts are made at ruining the outer suburbs and rural areas. Whites can only flee so much. It is important to maintain this attitude in the face of the liberal onslaught. </p>

<p><br>
Man, &#8220;playing the dozens&#8221; is getting to be such a dangerous game these days! Why, a simple &#8220;Yo mama so fat&hellip;&#8221; can be enough to get some people pulling those triggers and ending those 21-year-old lives. </p>
<p>Well, at least in those neighborhoods where both IQ and impulse-control are noticeably lacking. <br>

<p>Once again the black community is struck by taunt-related deaths. The grim specter of taunt speech takes an especially heavy toll on the black community. How many aspiring rappers and honor students must fall victim to taunts before our leaders enact desperately needed taunt speech laws and sensible taunt control? Many look forward to the happy day when the black community is no longer plagued by vile taunts.</p>

		<p>As disturbing as this story is, we should keep in mind that the crime rate in the United States is declining, both nationally, and in  the Nation&rsquo;s Capital.  <br>
 <br>
In 1988 the rate of violent and property crime in Washington, DC was 7,113.0 per 100,000 inhabitants.  In 2009 that had declined to 3,997.9 per 100,000 inhabitants.<br>
