			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Sowell, Creators Syndicate, September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Few things have captured in microcosm what has gone so painfully wrong, where racial issues are concerned, like the recent election for mayor of Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Mayor Adrian Fenty, under whom the murder rate has gone down and the school children&rsquo;s test scores have gone up, was resoundingly defeated for re-election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One key fact tells much of the story: Mayor Fenty received more than 70 percent of the white vote in Washington. His opponent received more than 80 percent of the black vote.</p>
<p>Both men are black. But the head of the school system that he [Fenty] appointed is Asian and the chief of police is a white woman. More than that, most of the teachers who were fired were black. There were also bitter complaints that black contractors did not get as many of the contracts for doing business with the city as they expected.</p>
<p>In short, the mayor appointed the best people he could find, instead of running a racial patronage system, as a black mayor of a city with a black majority is apparently expected to. He also didn&rsquo;t spend as much time schmoozing with the folks as was expected.</p>
<p>So what if he gave their children a better education and gave everybody a lower likelihood of being murdered?</p>
<p>The mayor&rsquo;s faults were political faults. He did his job, produced results and thought that this should be enough to get him re-elected. He refused to do polls and focus groups, and he ignored what his political advisers were warning him about.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>How did we reach the point where black voters put racial patronage and racial symbolism above the education of their children and the safety of everyone?</p>
<p>There are many reasons but the trend is ominous. One key factor was the creation, back in the 1960s, of a whole government-supported industry of race hustling.</p>
<p>President Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;war on poverty&#8221;  &mdash;  a war that we have lost, by the way  &mdash;  bankrolled all kinds of local &#8220;leaders&#8221; and organizations with the taxpayers&rsquo; money, in the name of community &#8220;participation&#8221; in shaping the policies of government.</p>
<p>These &#8220;leaders&#8221; and community activists have had every reason to hype racial resentments and to make issues &#8220;us&#8221; against &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the largely untold stories of our time has been the story of how ACORN, Jesse Jackson and other community activists have been able to transfer billions of dollars from banks to their own organizations&rsquo; causes, with the aid of the federal government, exemplified by the Community Reinvestment Act and its sequels.</p>
<p>Racial anger and racial resentments are the fuel that keeps this lucrative racket going. How surprised should anyone be that community activist groups have used mau-mau disruptions in banks and harassed both business and government officials in their homes?</p>

		<p>One thing he forgot to mention here is that Michelle Rhee, the Korean that Fenty picked to &#8220;turn around&#8221; the DC schools, replaced all these fired black women teachers with barely English literate H-1B visa holders from Asia, mainly the Phillippines.  Now, Rhee is shacking up with the Mayor of Sacramento, former NBAer Kevin Johnson.</p>

		<p>Then let them have what they want.  Stories like this only make our White liberal elites who demand that &#8220;we atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privilege&#8221; look like race traitor fools.</p>
<p>What I most adore about the blacks is how reliable they are in making our White liberal elites into complete imbicilic failures.</p>
<p>Hooray for the blacks! Next step, please integrate the White synagogues and bring about total social equality- no sexual segregation.<br>

<p>Is that true, I wonder?  Or was it just that the murder statistics were more successfully cooked and the tests more effectively dumbed-down?</p>

		<p>What the article fails to note is that there are actual physical-structure &#8216;community centers&rsquo; in certain ethnic neighborhoods across the country. They might be better described as Marxist and black-power child care centers (or as anti-white indoctrination centers). It&rsquo;s not as if they don&rsquo;t get the same (but less open) treatment at their local school during the day. Wonder how Eurocentric, neighborhood community centers are doing across the country. </p>

<p>A high murder rate is more closely related to forced busing than anything else. Wonder if test scores also correlate to forced busing?</p>

		<p>I have used the term &#8220;resentment&#8221; in describing the overriding Black attitude for years. The &#8220;slave morality&#8221; born of entrenched resentment as described by Nietzsche in his &#8220;Geneology of Morals,&#8221; lives on in many peoples but none seem to have made it their own quite like American Blacks. It is good to see Sowell acknowledging this aspect of his peoples&rsquo; continued group failure.  </p>

		<p>I agree with you Mr Sowell,however, are you just coming to this realization now? the majority of blacks never miss an opportunity to stick it to whitey instead of choosing to act in their own &#8220;community&rsquo;s&#8221; or even personal best interest (even in cases like these when &#8220;whitey&#8221; is black).  every racially conscious American knows it never was about equality or &#8220;diversity&#8221;, only power.  It is why they cannot be trusted on juries, as witnesses, as police, soldiers, lawyers, judges, or politicians.</p>

Look at the Cong Black Caucus. None of these members could be entrusted to administer your estate. They routinely elect and re-elect crooks. One cannot build a worth-while country with such primitive people. No one ever has!<br>

		<p>It is a mistake to treat any blacks as individuals. They may have their own personal idiosycracies, but they all, 100% of them, have one glaring fact in common: Their tribal identity trumps everything else. Even common sense. Especially common sense. How else to explain why 100% of blacks agree that O.J. Simpson is guilty?</p>

		<p>The resentment mentality is indeed very strong. I actually find that it is worse in the blacks living in the suburbs nearer to the cities, than in the major cities themselves. I don&rsquo;t know if its proximity to seeing other communities that work, or something else, but the anger level is much higher, and they are often a far more dangerous place to be for a white person. </p>

		<p>Question Diversity, the same thing happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.  Officials there took advantage of the catastrophe and replaced the American teachers with East Asians, mostly Filipinos.  The scores for black students actually were the same as before Michelle Rhee stepped in.  Education starts at home.  They replaced the teachers but they didn&rsquo;t replace the home environments which caused the failures.  Schools don&rsquo;t raise children.</p>

		<p>Like James Taggart and the rest of the looting class in <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>, blacks hate us because of two glaring truths that even they, in their self-made world of unreality, can&rsquo;t deny:</p>
<p>1. They need us for their very survival.<br>
2. We don&rsquo;t need them at all.</p>
<p>Therefore they would happily kill us all, even knowing that their own deaths would quickly follow.</p>
<p>As for DC, Congress made a big mistake granting it home rule. They should re-assert their power under the Constitution and once again exercise total authority over the District.</p>

		<p>These local skirmishes are happening now in virtually every locale. Every single election is racially charged. First, it was only the large, predominantly black cities, then it became all the large cities, followed by mid-sized, and small cities and towns. Accusations of racism and racial issues now permeate even same-race elections. The U.S. is at war with itself (what has become a sad shadow of its former self) and the battles will spread, grow, and become much more frequent and violent. </p>

<p>Sowell doesn&rsquo;t deserve any respect.  He&rsquo;s just as black as any other african, and he&rsquo;s working his own race card racket. He says what White Humanity wants to hear, and he get well paid for it.  He&rsquo;s the exception only in what he says, not in what he would do if choosing between advancing black interests over White interests.  If elected to Congress, he would join the Black Caucus and never allow Whites as members.  </p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s all &#8216;liberals&rsquo; see on television and learn in school? Perhaps it&rsquo;s because whites inhabit a sort of &#8216;racelessness&rsquo; or a de-humanized place in our society - anything might befall whites and no one could be expected to know or care? But I think it more likely &#8216;liberals&rsquo; simply don&rsquo;t want to know. It&rsquo;s not so much they fear being labelled &#8216;racist&rsquo;, the pleasure they get from degrading folks like us is greater than any need have to be honest. </p>

<p>Similar to what you have noticed, it seems to be a well-established truism that Muslims in the United States are more likely to be involved in terrorism than Muslims in Muslim lands.  In fact, the truism goes so far as to state that a Muslim who immigrates becomes enraged only after immigrating here.  They wouldn&rsquo;t be so mad if they would have stayed where they were.</p>
<p>And your reason I think applies to this as well   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s the contrast between (white) places and societies that &#8220;work&#8221; and ones that &#8220;don&rsquo;t&#8221; (theirs) which enrages them.  Back in their own places, they were none the wiser about how &#8220;good&#8221; it was out there   &mdash;   misery and poverty was merely the order of the day.</p>

<p>Of course, racial pride disallows them from accepting any blame for their own condition. It can&rsquo;t possibly be their own people who are at fault!  So, whose fault is it?  </p>
<p>Obviously it is evil white racists who have engineered blacks&rsquo; miserable social conditions; created their chaotic, crime-ridden communities;  and foisted on them their second class economic status.  Without whitey, life would be paradise.</p>
