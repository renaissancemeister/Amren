<h1>Mounties to Recruit for Women and Minorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Freeze, Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The RCMP plans to make white, male police officers a minority on the force within a generation as it struggles to better reflect the multicultural face of Canada.</p>
<p>Under new hiring benchmarks set this month, senior Mounties say that new classes of recruits should comprise 30 per cent women, 20 per cent visible minorities and 10 per cent aboriginals, The Globe has learned. If the benchmarks are met, it would be the first time &#8220;minority&#8221; hires would actually represent a majority of RCMP recruits.</p>
<p>These benchmarks amount to a near doubling, tripling and quintupling of the respective categories of cadets recruited last year. Figures show that, under less ambitious employment-equity goals then, the RCMP graduated classes that were 17 per cent women, 7 per cent visible minorities and 2 per cent aboriginal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a responsibility to be representative of the communities we serve,&#8221; Inspector Jo Ann Smith, the RMCP&rsquo;s head of employment equity, said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&rsquo;t just six-foot-two-inch males in the population,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Think of it this way: If you have a culturally diverse police force, then you&rsquo;re going to be able to respond to the calls you get from communities better. You&rsquo;re going to have people who understand those communities better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like most police forces, the RCMP has been a bastion of tough, white men that under-represents women and ethnic groups. Meanwhile, Canada has grown ever more multicultural. The country&rsquo;s population is 51 per cent women, 15 per cent visible minorities and 4 per cent aboriginal, according to 2006 census data. (The Mounties do over-represent aboriginals in their ranks, given they often patrol those communities.)</p>
<p>Parliamentarians this year chided the force for being too male and too white. &#8220;A better balance with females and minorities will create a better RCMP and a better, peaceful, orderly Canada,&#8221; a group of Liberal senators wrote in a position paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important that the RCMP reflect the face of Canada for policing reasons,&#8221; said Liberal Senator Colin Kenny in an interview. He argued that the investigation into the 1984 Air India terrorist tragedy failed, in part, because federal agents couldn&rsquo;t understand the language of the suspects.</p>
<p>Commissioner William Elliott, a career Ottawa bureaucrat appointed to lead the force three years ago, has frequently vowed to make his force more &#8220;progressive.&#8221; He claims to have changed the composition of the force somewhat, but figures show the Mounties&rsquo; ranks are still only 20 per cent female, 7 per cent visible minority and 7 per cent aboriginal.</p>
<p>The recruiting strategy has caused some tension in RCMP ranks. Some long-serving Mounties privately say they don&rsquo;t feel that race and gender should be major parts of the hiring equation  &mdash;  they argue jobs should be given on merit only, and that being a police officer remains a physical job.</p>
<p>The RCMP makes male and female recruits pass the same baseline physical tests. Proponents for a more multicultural force say that anything lost in brute force would be made up in empathy, language skills and the ability to reach out to cultural communities.</p>
<p>Police forces that seek to become more diverse often discover they have to make an extra effort to do so. Many immigrants come from countries where police are repressive, cliquish and unwelcoming to women and minorities.</p>
<p>Some strides are being made in Canada. Earlier this year, Toronto Police said they graduated a class that was 33 per cent made up of visible minorities, 23 per cent female. The Ontario Provincial Police force claims to be more than 30 per cent female, but says it doesn&rsquo;t track the races of the ranks.</p>
<p>The Mounties no longer talk of their hiring goals being &#8220;targets,&#8221; preferring now to use a less-committal term, &#8220;benchmarks.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t just six-foot-two-inch males in the population,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Just goes to demonstrate the complete illogic that permeates liberals&rsquo; minds. Just walking down a street will reveal men in that height range.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it this way: If you have a culturally diverse police force, then you&rsquo;re going to be able to respond to the calls you get from communities better. You&rsquo;re going to have people who understand those communities better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t realize it, but she&rsquo;s undermining the diversity and multiculturalism she holds so dear. If you have to hire people of an ethnic background to police people of the same ethnic background, then you&rsquo;re tacitly admitting that people of different races can&rsquo;t get along with each other, thus showing up multiculturalism as &#8216;the theory with no clothes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8216;The Mounties do over-represent aboriginals in their ranks, given they often patrol those communities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ah, so they&rsquo;re implying, but not directly stating, that they have to hire more non-white police officers because non-whites commit more crimes.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better balance with females and minorities will create a better RCMP and a better, peaceful, orderly Canada&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? Check out the countries that minorities come from and see how many of them are really better than Canada, let alone more peaceful and orderly. It&rsquo;s because those countries are so violent, unproductive, and disorganized that these people immigrate to western countries.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8216;He argued that the investigation into the 1984 Air India terrorist tragedy failed, in part, because federal agents couldn&rsquo;t understand the language of the suspects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just goes to show that the real solution is to maintain a homogenous nation, where everyone can understand each other, including police understanding criminals.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8216;Proponents for a more multicultural force say that anything lost in brute force would be made up in empathy, language skills and the ability to reach out to cultural communities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Really? Are non-western countries where minorities come from really kinder and more tolerant than Canada? And if my house is being broken into, I want the police officers who come to be tough and able to dispense brute force against the criminals. It&rsquo;s about their duty to come to my aid. What good are a bunch of RCMP officers who can only deal with murdering thugs by volunteering to shake hands and demonstrating that they&rsquo;re fluent in Somali or Urdu?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whew! Just had to kick-butt all that left-wing illogic!</p>

<p>- So canadians make plans to displace their traditional race?  Isn&rsquo;t that racist also?  So quotas trump all other factors?  </p>
<p>Next time I&rsquo;m in Canada it will feel really weird getting pulled over by a thickly-accented jamaican woman wearing the red uniform and mounties hat!</p>

<p>If that was so, then why are many American cities, with a lot of blacks in the general population and in the P.D., still violent?  Applying this logic, then the black cops should be able to have some sort of special understanding about black civilians to deter them from committing violent crimes.</p>
<p>At least in the case of the RCMP, this might not matter.  After all, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the RCMP is into enforcing the laws on violent crimes   &mdash;   From the news I&rsquo;ve read, here on AR and in other places, all the RCMP is charged with doing is persecuting those who express right-wing opinions.  And you don&rsquo;t need someone who is physically fit to do that.</p>

		<p>The bad white mounties can&rsquo;t understand the language of the suspects? In Canada? OK. I assume most Mounties speak French nd English,or work next to a French speaking partner or boss. So we are talking about what? Urdu? Swahili? Chinese? Why would there be anyone in Canada who doesn&rsquo;t speak English or French? Same question for America, where English should be required for anyone but a tourist on a valid visa. Jail the &#8220;suspect&#8221; as a terrorist. On Ellsmere Island. And that ain&rsquo;t like Hawaii.</p>

		<p>I sense a certain inequity here;  we have this female, minority, aboriginal quota for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&hellip;.NOW, can we be sure that the criminals being sought for apprehension are also equally female, minority, aboriginal?</p>
<p>I remember: &#8220;the mounties always get their man&#8221;, THAT is sexist!  What if the &#8220;man&#8221; is a &#8220;girl&#8221;?  Then do we only send out girl Mounties?  Can a criminal who is to be apprehended sue discrimination if his captors are white men, when he/she is not of the same persuasion?</p>
<p>Just wondering?</p>

		<p>Organizations like the RCMP can maintain high standards while using affirmative action to hire a certain percentage of their cadre, but there is a limit. What percentage of the force can be affirmative action before standards begin to seriously erode? These new goals will push the contingent of mounted police selected primarily on the basis of race or gender up to 60% and I would speculate probably past the breaking point. Expect to see the force&rsquo;s effectiveness compromised in coming years. People will eventually learn the hard way what common sense should be able to tell them. </p>

		<p>Even on the Globe and Mail site the comments for this were overwhelmingly against this affirmative action. Which in Canada, because we never had segregation or slavery (except against Irish) the whole point for AA in the States is useless here. The conservative government brought up getting rid of AA but I don&rsquo;t know if that went anywhere</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to assume that all new minority hires are going to be multi-lingual and cognizant of all racial and ethnic people.</p>
<p>When a black Jamaican Mountie stops to question a Chinese immigrant with limited English skills, the black Jamaican Mountie will be able to speak to the Chinese immigrant on their level, both in terms of language and culture?</p>
<p>The given reason for this policy is that white men apparently can&rsquo;t communicate with minorities. Where is the proof that minorities can effectual community with other minorities? </p>

		<p>For decades now, liberals have been telling us that we must have more ethnic minorities in all our police forces so that they are better equipped to deal with our diverse ethnic culture.   And just what message are they supposed to convey to all these various groups?    Which nationality does not understand that murder, robbery, rape, assault, drug dealing, drunk driving, arson, burglary, etc. are illegal criminal acts?  In most Third World countries, the penalties for these crimes are much harsher than in Canada.   If thes people really do not understand the difference between right and wrong until it is explained to them by a policeman who speaks their language then why would we let them into our country?</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re using PC to clean up the Mounties&rsquo; image which has been dragged through the dirt by several bloody scandals, the most famous was Robert Dziekanski who was tasered to death. Four cops were there. The Mountie in charge was native Indian. The Mountie who tasered Dziekanski five times was black.</p>
<p>In another RCMP killing the Mountie who shot an unarmed man named Jeff Hughes over and over  again (possibly because he was a &ldquo;white supremacist&rdquo;) was female.</p>
<p>So they try to divert attention from these scandals by what? Hiring more Indians, blacks and women.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m in my mid-40&rsquo;s but have only been to Canada once (Niagara Falls so it doesn&rsquo;t really count) but I remember as a kid parents and family friends often taking visits to Canada. They would always remark about how clean everything was up there. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but there might have been a racial component to their observation. At least, I suspect not so many people are visiting Canadian big-cities now remarking how clean and wonderful everything is. Would be interesting looking at real tourism figures in regards to American and Canada. <br>

		<p>Here we go again! Let&rsquo;s shut out more qualified white male recruits in favour of playing racial politics in a nation still comprised of a 84% White population.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the National Post reported on June 27, 2005, the so-called shortfall of qualified applicants to the RCMP academy was due to its gender and racial hiring quotas that required Canadian WHITE males to score 20% higher than women&hellip;&hellip; and 33% HIGHER than visible-minorities on aptitude tests to be accepted&#8221;. <a href="https://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2007/09/17/destroying-effective-policing/" rel="nofollow"><b>&hellip;.more HERE</b></a>.</p>
<p>This A-A or employment-equity nonsense has surely damaged a once-respected police force and certainly destroyed the <i>esprit de corp</i> that also held some respect in previous years.</p>
<p>Today, they&rsquo;re trying to reform a national Canadian tradition into something resembling the French Foreign Legion.</p>

This is going to turn out just like US schools, police forces, local government, etc.</p>
<p>First they fill the rank and file with non-whites. Things get worse. The proposed solution is that the leadership needs to reflect the new minority rank and file. So we get minority heads of Mountie departments. Things get worse and everyone blames &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo; and declares &#8216;racist white folk&rsquo; as the problem.</p>

		<p>Adding Ethnic-X to &#8216;better police&rsquo; Ethnic-X is akin to letting the fox tell the farmer what a chicken is as he hands over the keys to the coop.</p>
<p>We saw this all the time in Iraq, we continue to do so in AfG, a man, whether a translator or a cop or a line soldier _will not_ act against members of a community he has to live among.</p>
<p>Even the Russians, during their revolution and the maintenance of the resulting Soviet Union, knew enough Machiavelli to use, not the same but an opposed ethny from far away to ensure the stability of a pacified region.  Because the cops didn&rsquo;t seek company among the hateful populace and the populace knew that they couldn&rsquo;t get away with any funny business from utterly unsympathetic policing forces.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Beyond the increasing problem of black, Hispanic, and immigrant police officers who are simply criminals in uniform, is the more common problem of affirmative action hires who, in addition to being unfit for the job, see themselves as sworn not to enforce the law, but rather to aid members of their respective groups, including criminals, the law &mdash; and the public &mdash; be damned.</p>
<p>Consider an example from Southern California in Victor Davis Hanson&rsquo;s book, Mexifornia: A State of Becoming. A Mexican woman ran a stop light, and hit the car of Hanson&rsquo;s daughter. Instead of writing up a report on the accident and ticketing the guilty party, the Mexican-American officer let the offender off &mdash; after getting her telephone number &mdash; without any points being added to her license, thus cheating the Anglo victim out of justice, and jeopardizing public safety.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/stix/051004_diversity.htm</p>
<p>I would suggest that a big, unflappable, -resident ethnic- police officer is more likely to garner the respect of an immigrant used to haggling for anything, including submission to justice, than someone he thinks he can convince of coethnic interests in a nation of other strangers.  Whether the Mounty agrees, privately, or not, it&rsquo;s more hassle, not less.</p>
<p>Finally, what exactly -are- the hiring standards here?  I doubt seriously if a woman is going to be in the same physical classification as a man which begs the question of whether the testing standards are lowered and I doubt equally if a poor minority is going to be able to pass an aptitude battery as well as a college educated person.  If the applicant has -equal skills- then he/she doesn&rsquo;t need quota&rsquo;d affirmative action but should be able to succeed on merit alone.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Not necessarily. Peters is black. Black candidates routinely flunk the police exam, yet are hired by the NYPD. In his influential, bestselling race book, Two Nations: White and Black, Separate, Hostile, Unequal, leftist political scientist Andrew Hacker of the City University of New York&rsquo;s Queens College campus actually celebrated the hiring of blacks who failed the exam. Meanwhile, psychology professor Linda Gottfredson of the University of Delaware has pointed out that some departments, under political pressure to increase minority hiring, have &#8220;racially gerrymandered&#8221; their examinations to the point where minority applicants with minimal literacy and no law enforcement experience can pass them, while white applicants with records of both academic and professional excellence in law enforcement mysteriously fail them.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making better recruitment and hiring decisions on the front end would ease the embarrassment of having to fire officers on the back end&hellip;. In almost all incidents, someone who is a lawbreaker after being hired had something in their background that was a red flag&hellip;.  <br>
&gt;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s strange how we in The West seem to want to maintain our privileged status as the nation &#8216;others want to come to&rsquo; because we have these wonderful systems of laws which make us safer and richer.  But when the immigrants arrive, suddenly it is their way of life which must be endorsed and cossetted as though it were superior.</p>

		<p> If you have a culturally diverse police force, then you&rsquo;re going to be able to respond to the calls you get from communities better.</p>
<p>It would be better to have only people who understand the law better and the difference between breaking and NOT breaking the law. Muslims for example have no problem with beating women or being married to several of them at the same time NOR beating or killing a non muslim!</p>

		<p>Trying to incorporate third world immigrants and their descendants into all Western institutions is destructive enough as it is, but I would like to comment on the gender issue.  I don&rsquo;t know much about &#8220;mounties&#8221; as I am not Canadian.  I will say though that as an American WOMAN, I strongly feel that women have no business in the military, police force, or in fire departments.  I don&rsquo;t even feel comfortable when I look in the cockpit as I am boarding a plane, and I see a woman sitting up there!  </p>
<p>Not only are men stronger than women but they also think differently than we do, and they are able to reason and rationalize through certain situations better.  I am sorry if that offends people but that is the truth.  Incorporating women into everything in America and the rest of the West, is just as dangerous as incorporating minorities into everything.  </p>
<p>As women, we are suited for talking to people, being sympathetic, and giving people shoulders to cry on, as well as nurturing young children.  We are most certainly NOT suited for high stress and high adrenaline type jobs where peoples&rsquo; lives are in our hands (airline pilot, policeMAN, fireMAN etc&hellip;).</p>

		<p>I agree with Courtney in that men are physically stronger than women and are generally better suited to jobs which require a lot of physical strength. I also think that one of the reasons why women are so outnumbered in the RCMP is that there are probably much fewer female applicants. </p>

		<p>I think We need a Women&rsquo;s contingent in the Police.<br>
Still, One of the Globe Comments notes that there<br>
isn&rsquo;t any impetuus to break up &#8220;Pink Ghettos&#8221; <br>
like the Human Resources Services in Government.<br>
There are many other &#8220;Pink Ghettos&#8221; Teachers etc. Some of Them<br>
are good Jobs that Men should have equal access to.<br>
I see allot of Government Jobs being closed to<br>
White Males, as well as jobs closing elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Equality? How about Jeff Hughes, the white activist gunned down at his apartment by the RCMP over a dozen times when he had no gun? And the officer who did this was farmed out to the provinces and the case ignored? This isn&rsquo;t Sgt. Preston, and it&rsquo;s not the Canada I used to like. </p>
