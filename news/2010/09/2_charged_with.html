<h1>2 Charged With Hate Crime in Assault on Teen; 1 Arrested</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Sullivan, Seattle Times, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two men who were questioned and released by Seattle police after a West Seattle teen was beaten in a racially charged attack have been charged in connection with the May 25 assault. One of the men was arrested Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>DNA recently linked Ahmed Mohamed and Jonathan Baquiring to the attack in which a 16-year-old boy was robbed, taunted with racial insults, burned with a lit cigarette and punched repeatedly. Mohamed, 22, and Baquiring, 21, each were charged Monday with first-degree robbery and malicious harassment, the state&rsquo;s hate-crime statute.</p>
<p>Baquiring was booked into the King County Jail just after 6 p.m. Tuesday, according to the booking register. His bail is set at $500,000.</p>
<p>Seattle police are still searching for Mohamed.</p>
<p>King County Deputy Prosecutor Samantha Kanner will also seek to have Mohamed held on $500,000 bail once he is arrested, according to charging papers.</p>
<p>The victim, Shane McClellan, said he was walking home around 2 a.m. when two men, whom he described as black and Filipino, asked him for a light.</p>
<p>He said the two men then robbed him and beat him for four hours, whipping him with his own belt while saying things like, &#8220;How do you like it, white boy?&#8221; and &#8220;This is for enslaving our people,&#8221; according to the police report.</p>
<p>McClellan, who is white, said the two men also poured Four Loko energy beer on him, burned him with a cigarette and urinated on him, police said.</p>

		<p>If there is a conviction, they will without a doubt get a far lighter sentence than the white doofus that burned a one foot cross on a black couples lawn a few years ago(ten years).</p>

		<p>Enslaving their people? but there people arent enslaved. Maybe 100 years ago. </p>
<p>Second Africans still enslave Africans til this day. I dont see the same wave of attacks against fellow africans.</p>
<p>What a lame excuse. What a Lame society we live in today.</p>

		<p>Terrible!  I would sure love to see some White solidarity marching through the streets and demanding justice everytime there is a black on White crime, for once! Guess it will never happen in my lifetime as I haven&rsquo;t seen so much as a peep coming out of any of &#8220;our&#8221; White talking heads. But notice that they will yell whenever a White attacks a black, which is once in a blue moon compared to the reverse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;a 16-year-old boy was robbed, taunted with racial insults, burned with a lit cigarette and punched repeatedly. Mohamed, 22, and Baquiring, 21&#8221;</p>
<p>If the racial roles were reversed, they would have said: &#8220;young black man [not boy] beaten by two white thugs&#8221;!</p>
<p>This too is a very aggravated offense. The &#8220;boy&#8221; was held captive [unlawful restraint and kidnapping?] for four hours [?] and the attack was by adults upon a minor. Aggravated and egregious offenses.</p>

		<p>An outrage. They&rsquo;ve even made such a clean, genteel city as Seattle an unsafe place for our kids to be out in public.</p>
<p>More importantly, where is the national media on this story? Where? Is there any doubt that a similar story, with the race of the victim reversed, would get national headlines?</p>
<p>In many, many parts of this country, white children cannot walk the streets safely for fear of being targeted for assault for no other reason than the color of their skin.</p>
<p>Given this fact, &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is a ridiculous myth. Pass it on.</p>

		<p>It would seem to me that there should ba other charges against these &#8220;men&#8221; muslim converts by their names, and such charges I should think would be in the nature of assaulting a minor, child endangerment, kidnapping and other things. I do agree with Peejay in Frisco that the sentences will be ridiculously light IF any sentences are given.</p>

		<p>Good luck finding Mohammed. It&rsquo;s been four months (the police had them the same day, but no arrests though - why?). Mohhamed wasn&rsquo;t stupid enough to sit around and wait till they come for him: the police may not have been sure he did it, but he was. So he skipped the town, surprise, surprise. Btw, if you remember, the same pair did something similar within a week after attacking McClellan - they attacked, though not as nastily, a bunch of teenagers at a convenience store. Google for it, you&rsquo;ll find it. Takes four months to take a couple of thugs off the streets, not bad. Well, only one of them, sorry.</p>

		<p>The black criminal&rsquo;s &#8220;reason&#8221; for assaulting an innocent white   &mdash;   slavery   &mdash;   reminded me of my own visit to Seattle a couple years ago. I watched the police escort a black panhandler from the Fish Market. The aggressive beggar whined, &#8220;I was a slave for 400 years!&#8221; The cop corrected him: &#8220;you were never a slave.&#8221; Is the &#8220;slavery-made-me-do-it&#8221; cop-out especially favored up there? What is the wear-out date on that excuse? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard Seattle is the whitest big city left in America. Did the rulers notice and start flooding in all those &#8220;benefits&#8221; of PC diversity? And is the Northwest Homeland idea we hear about thus infeasible? Just curious. </p>

		<p>We have one here: They got away with it though </p>
<p>At Finbury Park station Ali, who had drunk a bottle of Jack Daniel&rsquo;s whiskey in Trafalgar Square with Jamil that night, aimed a punch at Mr Sanson over his girlfriend&rsquo;s shoulder. Miss Le Doussal turned around to ask what was going on, only for Ali to punch her in the face, leaving her with a black eye.</p>
<p>Fellow passenger Daniel Hurley stepped in to remonstrate but as the argument spilled out onto the platform, Jamil punched him in the temple, knocking him to the floor. Jamil then aimed a kick at his head, while Ali kicked him in the legs. Mr Hurley later received hospital treatment before being released.</p>
<p>Ali was given a suspended 12-month prison sentence and Jamil a suspended eight-month term. Both have community service orders, must pay compensation to their victims and court costs, and obey a six-month curfew order.</p>
