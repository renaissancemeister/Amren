<h1><a href="https://www.skynews.com.au/politics/article.aspx?id=513545&amp;articleID=">EU Threaten France Over Roma Crackdown</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sky News (North Sydney, Australia), September 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Europe is threatening legal action against France over its crackdown on Roma minorities, drawing a parallel between their treatment and World War II-era deportations.</p>
<p>The European Union&rsquo;s top justice official, Viviane Reding, on Tuesday angrily rebuked the French government for sending hundreds of Roma migrants back to Romania and Bulgaria since August in a security sweep ordered by President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
<p>Reding said she was &#8216;appalled by a situation which gave the impression that people are being removed from a member state of the European Union just because they belong to a certain ethnic minority.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is a situation I had thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War,&rsquo; she underlined, warning of looming infringement proceedings by the European Commission.</p>
<p>Reding chided Paris after a leaked memo &#8216;openly contradicted&rsquo; assurances given by two ministers to the commission that specific ethnic groups had not been targeted in France.</p>
<p>The August 5 memo, signed by the interior minister&rsquo;s chief of staff and sent to police chiefs, states that &#8216;300 camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months, Roma camps are a priority.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The role of the commission as guardian of (Europe&rsquo;s) treaties is made extremely difficult if we can no longer have confidence in the assurances given by two ministers in a formal meeting,&rsquo; Reding said.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is not a minor offence,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;After 11 years of experience in the commission, I even go further: this is a disgrace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The French government, which denies targeting Roma minorities specifically and insists its measures comply with EU laws, said it was astonished by Reding&rsquo;s criticism but that it would not be drawn into an argument.</p>
<p>&#8216;We don&rsquo;t think that this kind of declaration will help improve the predicament of the Roma, who are at the heart of our concerns,&rsquo; said foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero.</p>
<p>France has deported some 1,000 Roma migrants to Bulgaria and Romania since last month, and more than 8,000 Roma have been deported since the beginning of the year, after 9,875 were expelled in 2009.</p>
<p>On the day Brussels threatened legal action, France flew another 69 Roma back to Romania.</p>
<p>The EU parliament urged France to suspend the removal of Gypsies last week, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned on Monday that the measures &#8216;exacerbate the stigmatisation of Roma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The European Commission said its legal analysis of the Roma crackdown would be completed in the coming days.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am personally convinced that the commission will have no choice but to initiate infringement proceedings against France,&rsquo; Reding said.</p>
<p>The procedure gives EU states the opportunity to conform with the union&rsquo;s laws, but any failure to do so can lead to a case before the EU Court of Justice, which can impose fines.</p>
<p>The commission would take France to task &#8216;for a discriminatory application&rsquo; of the 27-nation EU&rsquo;s freedom of movement, she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;I will, of course, give the French authorities the right to submit comments on the new developments in the course of the next days. But I make it very clear my patience is wearing thin: enough is enough,&rsquo; Reding said.</p>
<p>&#8216;No member state can expect special treatment, especially not when fundamental values and European laws are at stake.</p>
<p>&#8216;This applies today to France. This applies equally to all other member states, big or small, which would be in a similar situation. You can count on me for that.&rsquo;<br>

<p>Rubbish. She doesn&rsquo;t even know history.</p>
<p>Following the Second World War, millions of people were forced to move, encouraged by the victorious allies to &#8216;go home&rsquo; to their ethnic roots.  Germans in particular were singled out for repatriation.  </p>
<p>It was thought that by unscrambling the ethnicities, a new era of peace in Europe could be maintained through state-to-state dialogue in the flegling United Nations.</p>
<p>Rejecting this model, the EU seeks to have European nationalism broken down and rendered irrelevant, by re-inventing Europe as a melting pot of races and ethnicities.  When the work of the Eurocrats is complete, the unelected puppet-masters of global finance will take unchallenged control of power from the EU. </p>

		<p>Hopefully, these baby-steps in France (regarding Gypsies and the veil)   &mdash;   along with electoral gains for the Right and franker public debates in various countries   &mdash;    will lead to even better steps later on, such as deportations of thirdworlders and immigration freezes by European nations; especially in connection with the arrogant &#8220;hostile takeover&#8221; hordes of Islam. If current trends continue, then hey, maybe one day we Euro-Americans really can at last learn something from the Old World   &mdash;   though not quite along the lines intended by the minions of the African Socialist DC regime. </p>

		<p>On a recent trip to the Czech Republic I can tell you first-hand that these people are nothing but a menace.  I was in a train station in Brno and several of them tried to pick my pocket.  Fortunately I had been warned previously and was on guard for this type of thing.  The Czechs detest them and rightly so.  Prague has gone steadily downhill since they let these &#8216;migrants&rsquo; in. I am glad that France (of all places) is taking a stand.  </p>

		<p>All those nations that become members of the EU have made a pact with the devil. They still have their sovereignty as an independent nation, sort of! But those commissions and committees and groups of &#8220;experts&#8221; at the EU governing level want to do away with all that and make it the EU run strictly by Brussels. Home nations will not have a say. </p>
<p>And the gypsy, need to be sent - - back to India, from whence they originally came. Since India is now a booming economy, has plenty of jobs, and is prospering, why not send the gypsy back to their homeland. Better for them amongst their own kind.</p>

		<p>The EU is pulling the same stunt that our own federal government is pulling. They refuse to enforce the laws and then attack any member who tries to do it themselves. They&rsquo;re the proverbial dog in the manger. The problem with federalism is that it&rsquo;s just too far removed from the will of the people. Local governments are close enough that they have to listen somewhat.</p>

		<p>The irony is this:<br>
Since its inception the EU has always been a French dominated body.Germany provided the money whilst keeping quiet and France provided the leadership - believing that the EU was the vehicle allowing France to dominate the world stage, and ambition that was oft-thwarted by Britain and others.<br>
 All the execrable &#8216;human rights&rsquo; and &#8216;anti-discrimation&rsquo; laws forced on the EU from the top down are all French inspired, supposedly reflecting &#8216;French values&rsquo;.Previously the French used gloried in using these dictatorial undemocratic laws to bully and cow east European states.<br>
 Now they have backfired.</p>

		<p>As Spaniard, I am fully awared about the gypsies&rsquo; problem. They are the most evil race ever: forget blacks, latinos, and asians. Gypsies destroy everything they touch. They do not want to work, they steal what they want, they DEMAND welfare. Besides, if you have beef with one suddenly 8 relatives appear with knives. They mentally live in the Middle Age. </p>
<p>Tragically, in recent years a flood of romanian gypsies have reached spanish cities. And they are far worse than their spanish relatives. They even SELL THEIR BABIES. </p>
<p>Please, Government of the USA, shut up! We are not going to keep solving Romania&rsquo;s problems. We are fed up with them. Spain shall have to carry the problem of the spanish gypsies, but, as i said before, we are not going to provide solutions for romanian gypsies. </p>
<p>PS: Vive la France!</p>

		<p>Okay, so the EU levies a fine against France.  And, if the nation doesn&rsquo;t pay, then what?  <br>
European nations  &mdash;  and the U.S.  &mdash;  need to make their soil so hostile to unwanted immigrants that the latter want to leave and do so.  When laws become oppressive to a minority, its people will either become like the majority in behavior, suffer large-scale imprisonment, or get outta town.</p>

We Americans answered this question in 1860-1865.  It was an expensive answer.</p>
