		<p>Good for her - I hope she enjoys the gracious dinner. Why am I supposed to care about her in the first place? Lucky she&rsquo;s not in college in Saudi Arabia - her routine activities in the video would get her 99 lashes. Overall, she looks pretty clueless. That&rsquo;s the real problem.</p>
<p>As for the school, maybe they are going after those full paying Arab students.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a recruiting video for a college that&rsquo;s highlighting an Islamic studies student, but notice how few nonwhites there are in the video. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a single black in the entire video, for example, including in the entire a cappella group or in the lunchroom, despite the way all colleges trumpet their commitment to &#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>
<p>Diversity is something all colleges talk up but none ever actually achieves.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re nitwits raised by nitwits, brainwashed by media nitwits and raised to the ultimate level of nitwittedness by academic nitwits in a nitwit country which is starting to collapse in the perfect nitwit apocalypse.</p>

		<p>Interestingly enough, the school actually seems to have the numbers to support the statements it makes about diversity. This article states the incoming class statistics:</p>
<p>&#8220;International students constitute 25.5 percent of the class, with the greatest number of young women coming from China, Pakistan, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea. Another 26 percent of the class of 2014 is African American, Latina, Asian American or Native American.&#8221; </p>

<p>I guess these students didn&rsquo;t happen to be present at the activities with which this student was involved. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s our ruling class. </p>
<p>I like how they mix working-class trappings, such as jeans and t-shirts, with upper-class activities, such as horse riding. </p>
<p>All in a safe, first-world environment that many of us can no longer enjoy. </p>
<p>The real problem? A commitment to ideologies that are poisonous to the people   &mdash;   us   &mdash;   that these elites pretend to lead. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mere pretense and posturing, and we need to do the worst thing we can possibly do to these people: laugh at them, then go our own way. </p>
<p>Personally, I wish I&rsquo;d skipped the liberal nonsense in college and focused on a stripped down, hard-core classical education, complimented by a grounding in two or more useful trades. </p>

		<p>Oh, by the way, Mt. Holyoke does not require SAT scores for admission. Are you surprised? </p>
<p>Call it a dividend for well-connected whites. They benefit from diversity because their idiot kids don&rsquo;t have to pass what is basically an IQ test to get into a good school. </p>
<p>They just need money. </p>
<p>Plus they get to look down on those of us who have only a bit of brains and muscle to trade on, rather than the six-figures needed to buy our kids four years at this ridiculous multi-culti summer camp. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to fight to retain the SAT. It&rsquo;s caught in a vice from the upper classes who want to preserve their power from those with the brains to outwit their kids, and the masses of people who could never pass such a test. <br>

		<p>Poster #6 is so right!</p>
<p>That kind of very white college experience that was seen in this video is now fading fast in colleges all over the nation.  It seems to me that colleges in California are basically now just left-wing protest centers that are majority asian and other non-white now.  (When I first entered college in the 80s it was all about the academics.  Now it&rsquo;s all about &#8216;opposing the system&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>Chicago and east coast colleges have changed flavors, and many colleges here in new york are downright dangerous to walk in at night due to all the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in both the urban areas and more suburban places.  </p>
<p>I spent 20 years in colleges in the midwest and east coast and I can say there has been a marked shift in that time in the atmosphere.  Those really liberal-looking Holyoke women better enjoy their experiences while they can.  In 20 years when they send their daughters there, it will be fully &#8216;diverse&rsquo; and a hotbed of blacks on the prowl for easy, ditzy whites.</p>

		<p>Mt. Holyoke is  a joke. Look at their website. I remember in the late-&rsquo;90s viewing their site for the first time as I wanted to look up on Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s alma mater and recall visiting it quite frequently as the image gracing the main page was a group of charming White girls smiling at the camera with a sunny backdrop. It was moving. It&rsquo;s amazing how much can change in a decade. I wonder what Emily would think of the school now. Would she have attended it?</p>

		<p>Tim in Indiana:</p>
<p>Mount Holyoke College is a very upscale, all women&rsquo;s college in South Hadley,Massachusetts. It is considered one of the seven sister schools along with Smith College, Bryn Mawr College, Vassar College, Barnard Collge Pembroke College, Wellesley College and the former Radcliffe College. Since the late 1980s, Vassar and Barnard have admitted male students. The academics are very rigorous. The school has a number of renowned profesors, including two pulitzer prize winners.</p>
<p>The enrollment is about 1200 students. It is very selective to get into and the tuition is about $42,000 per year. About 20% of their student body is non-White. </p>
<p>Given the price tag, it is not surprisig that only a few non-Whites, or even many Whites for that matter, attend the school. It is probably safe to say that the majority of non-whites who attend the school are upscale, unless they are athletes. </p>

		<p>Aware and others:</p>
<p>The fact is that many of those diversity videos you see are just that. While there are Black, Hispanic, Asian and other non-White women attending Mount Holyoke, the fact is that the school is overwhelmingly White. Moreover, as Albert stated, most of the non-White women tend are often international or come from upper income families.</p>
<p>The school is also very academically rigorous.</p>

		<p>Being just a humble high school dropout, I wouldn&rsquo;t know a thing about these rarified matters &hellip; (unlike Mt. Holyoke&rsquo;s pampered babies, I had to go to work). </p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t  a clue about Mt. Holyoke. So I looked it up. It seems that not only racial but transgender and lesbian issues now dominate the debate at Mt. Holyoke (as well as at the famed and elite Seven Sisters).  As per Wiki:</p>
<p><i>Mount Holyoke has a student population of 2,200. Students come from &#8220;48 states and nearly 70 countries. One in three students is an international citizen or African American, Asian American, Latina, Native American, or multiracial. <br>
 <br>
Although Mount Holyoke only considers female applicants for admission, it will award diplomas to transgendered students who become male or identify themselves as male by the time they complete their studies. To reflect this fact, in 2005 Mount Holyoke&rsquo;s Student Government Association amended its constitution so that the word &#8220;she&#8221; was replaced with &#8220;student.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
It also has a student run group, True Colors for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender student. The Princeton Review rates Mount Holyoke fifth among its &#8220;Top 20 Gay Friendly Colleges&#8221;.</i></p>
<p>The five of the Seven Sisters which have remained female only appear to be hotbeds of lesbian activism, this apparently replaced racial activism. From Wiki:<br>
 <i>&#8220;[They] are liberal strongholds where students fiercely debate political action, gender identity and issues like &ldquo;heteronormativity,&rdquo; the marginalizing of standards that are other than heterosexual. Middle Eastern students who attend these colleges tell of a transition that can be jarring. The article quoted a Sri Lankan student (who had attended a coeducational school in Dubai) who stated that she was &#8220;shocked by the presence of so many lesbians among the students&#8221; and the &#8220;open displays of affection.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
Transgender issues: Recently, there has been discussion and controversy over how to accommodate transgender inclusion at the remaining women&rsquo;s colleges. This has risen to attention due to a small, yet increasing number of students that have in the course of their times at the colleges transitioned their gender from female to male (transman).&#8221; </i></p>

<p>Now then, Samantha, how do you reconcile those statements?  Unless you consider the meaning of &#8220;overwhelmingly white&#8221; to being one-third &#8220;other than&#8221;. </p>
