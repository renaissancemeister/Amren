			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dale Hurd, Christian Broadcasting Newtwork, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Friday in Paris. A hidden camera shows streets blocked by huge crowds of Muslim worshippers and enforced by a private security force.</p>
<p>This is all illegal in France: the public worship, the blocked streets, and the private security. But the police have been ordered not to intervene.</p>
<p>It shows that even though some in the French government want to get tough with Muslims and ban the burqa, other parts of the French government continue to give Islam a privileged status.</p>
<p>An ordinary French citizen who has been watching the Islamization of Paris decided that the world needed to see what was happening to his city. He used a hidden camera to start posting videos on YouTube. His life has been threatened and so he uses the alias of &#8220;Maxime Lepante. &#8220;</p>
<p><b>Lepante&rsquo;s View</b></p>
<p>His camera shows that Muslims &#8220;are blocking the streets with barriers. They are praying on the ground. And the inhabitants of this district cannot leave their homes, nor go into their homes during those prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Muslims taking over those streets do not have any authorization. They do not go to the police headquarters, so it&rsquo;s completely illegal,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some say Muslims must pray in the street because they need a larger mosque. But Lepante has observed cars coming from other parts of Paris, and he believes it is a weekly display of growing Muslim power.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming there to show that they can take over some French streets to show that they can conquer a part of the French territory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>France&rsquo;s Islamic Future?</b></p>
<p>If France faces an Islamic future, a Russian author has already written about it. The novel is called &#8220;The Mosque of Notre Dame, 2048,&#8221; a bestseller in Russia, not in France.</p>
<p>French publisher Jean Robin said the French media ignored the book because it was politically incorrect.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The book lays out a dark future when France has become a Muslim nation, and the famous cathedral has been turned into a mosque.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many there are,&#8221; he [French philosopher Radu Stoenescu] added. &#8220;The problem is the people who follow Islam; they&rsquo;re somehow in a political party, which has a political agenda, which means basically implementing Sharia and building an Islamic state.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>In Denial or Fed Up</b></p>
<p>From the 1980s until recently, criticizing or opposing Islam was considered a social taboo, and so the government and media effectively helped Islam spread throughout France.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were expecting Islam to adapt to France and it is France adapting to Islam,&#8221; Robin said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even if many government elites are in France are in denial over Islam, the people in the streets increasingly are not. Some have become fed up with what they see as the growing Islamization of France.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve started staging pork and wine &#8220;aperitifs,&#8221; or cocktail parties in the street. They&rsquo;re patriotic demonstrations meant to strike back against Islam.  Another national demonstration is planned for Saturday, Sept. 4.</p>
<p><b>A Warning to the West</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot accept the development of such practice because it&rsquo;s not compatible with the life in a modern society, you see,&#8221; he [Jean-Francois Cope, president of the Union for a Popular Movement political part] said. &#8220;And this question is not only a French question. You will all have to face this challenge. &#8220;<br/>

<p>Just like amerikan blacks and mestizos, aren&rsquo;t they?  Their race is their political party and its agenda.</p>
<p>I can easily believe that the French are fed up.  But I&rsquo;ll reserve judgment until I see them take action.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It shows that even though some in the French government want to get tough with Muslims and ban the burqa&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Well if even a <i>part</i> of the French government is pro-French, that makes it one step better than the 100% antiwhite amerikan regime.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;other parts of the French government continue to give Islam a privileged status.</i></p>
<p>And those &#8220;parts&#8221; would be right at home here in amerika.  I have no doubt that the Obongo regime is looking nervously at France, terrified that the French might start the boulder rolling before the Big Chief can arrange a UN invasion of Arizona.<br/>

Of course! Anybody who knows anything about Islam could have predicted that.</p>
<p>Islam does not make concessions;  it demands concessions.</p>

		<p>Attention! Attention!! There has been a change in  the national slogan for the French people. Due to unforseen circumstances our national cry has been updated from &#8220;They shall not pass!&#8221; to the more current &#8220;They shall not pray!&#8221; Please make a note of this and react accordingly&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The Muslims do this in other parts of Europe as well.  In Windsor England, about a mile from Windsor castle is the local high school.  Between the high school and the main street where the students catch their buses home is a commercial street.  The Muslims bought a small store and set it up as a mosque.  Every Friday starting about 11 am the Muslims sprawl all over the street hoping to start a confrontation with the students walking to the bus stop when school is over.</p>
<p>Then they can accuse the students of being skinheads neo nazis and hoot and holler about discrimination, the usual tactics the ADL teaches so well to the griping and grievance groups.</p>

<p>And I can almost guarantee that the private &#8220;security force&#8221; has access to all sorts of weaponry. All or Europe is awash from the arsenals of the fallen eastern European communist nations?</p>
<p>This is just one more effort to create more no-go zones in France. The indigenous Frenchman does not stand a chance against this evil that is aided and abetted by his own government in his own land.</p>
<p>Our mon ami Lepante is 100 % right on.</p>

<p>Wrong. It&rsquo;s not about &#8220;life in a modern society.&#8221; That is the weakest, lamest language to use to describe the situation. </p>
<p>This is about preserving French Culture and the French way of life. Period.</p>
<p>The French will either stand up and acknowledge that large numbers of Arabs practicing Islam is fundamentally Not French. Or they won&rsquo;t, and the beautiful, admirable culture and society that the French People have built for over a thousand years will dwindle, be compelled to change, adapt and become something unrecognizable, small and ultimately on the margins, as a footnote. A dead or dying culture. It&rsquo;s sad, because that&rsquo;s what will likely happen. We&rsquo;re witnessing the slow  death of all these wonderful European societies and their amazing cultures. </p>

		<p>The French have a serious case of Blind Side Syndrome.  They believe they can take in non-white people and turn them into psuedo-white people.  The fact is a non-white person will always be non-white.  Those characteristics that created whatever society they are coming from they are taking to France.  Only French people can preserve their French heritage.</p>

		<p>The track record of the French in the 20th century does not bode well for the 21st. The default mode seems to be surrender.</p>
<p>Unless a new Napoleon appears they better get their act together - if the French wait much longer imams will be running Notre Dame. </p>
<p>Battling an invasion of islamic fanatics takes more than pork and wine cocktail parties. It will need to get ugly before it gets better. Let&rsquo;s hope the French are up to it.</p>

<p>Will be interesting to read this when and if it gets published in English. 2048 is not very far from now. </p>
<p>One thing I would do (to add to this pork and wine party thing) is to have all the Frenchies walk their Poodles around to give a little &#8220;Sacre Peu&#8221; to the ground near where all this praying is going on. </p>

The average Parisian is likely fed up with Muslims and would like something done just like we are fed up with criminal alien Mexicans.</p>
<p>However, those in power crush democracy by the people and criminalize Frenchmen for speaking their minds as they do with us in the US.</p>

		<p>What percentage of muslims in france are dependent on welfare?</p>
<p>If france really wanted them gone, how tough would it be to simply cut these people off?</p>
<p>What does it mean that, even when forced by public opinion to give lip service to anti-muslim sentiment, they absolutely refuse to do this?</p>
<p>Is a single country in europe any different?  Have they really been &#8220;islamisized&#8221;?  Has islam really taken over the institutions of these countries?</p>
<p>Or are there just a large amount of muslims on welfare milling around causing problems.  The muslims may be an enemy army inside white lands&hellip;.but they are one without supply chains, support services or even access to weapons (other than a few criminals).  This situation isn&rsquo;t even close to being what it appears to be.</p>
<p>The second, and I mean the very second muslims become a real liability to the powers that be, they will be wiped out.  They are pawns.</p>

		<p>Muslims don&rsquo;t set French immigration policies - treasonous, totalitarian French leftists do, and they can only do so because they have murdered free speech and free press in France.  Leftists rule through controlling the flow of information by non-democratic means.  I won&rsquo;t take this line of thought any farther.</p>

		<p>A few years ago the French used to protest against &#8220;Americanization&#8221; in the form of McDonalds restaurants.  Now they have Muslim invaders taking over their capitol city.  Millions upon millions of white people die in a horrific civil war and what was gained?  Why was it fought and won only to have the &#8220;winning&#8221; sides become colonized by hostile nonwhite invaders? </p>

		<p>Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), or the &ldquo;Party of Liberation,&rdquo; is a revolutionary Islamist party that is actively working in over forty countries worldwide to establish an expansionist state and, ultimately, a new world order based on Islamist principles. Like all Islamist groups &mdash; whether violent or non-violent &mdash; HT interprets Islam as a holistic socio-political system. HT&rsquo;s ideology, which sanctions military coups and the mass killings of innocent peoples to achieve its desired political objectives, has helped inspire jihadist terrorism and bears crucial similarities to the doctrines of al-Qaeda and its affiliates.  Members of HT Pakistan have stated publicly that the party is targeting the country as a base for HT&rsquo;s Islamist state. The former HTB national executive member claims that HT&rsquo;s former leader, Shaykh Abdul Qadeem Zallum, singled out Pakistan for HT operations because the country possesses nuclear weapons.  Part of HT&rsquo;s strategy to gain power in Pakistan has been to recruit military officers to instigate and lead coups.  Moreover, an HT Pakistan 2008 press statement, hosted on HTB&rsquo;s current website, encourages Pakistan&rsquo;s army to attack the U.S., since Pakistan possesses the &ldquo;seventh largest Army in the World.&rdquo; The statement goes on to say that since Pakistan possesses &ldquo;nuclear weapons, missiles technology and half a million brave soldiers who are ready to attain martyrdom for Islam, it is in a good position to injure and bruise an already battered America to an extent which she cannot afford to stomach right now.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>In Islam anybody who does not believe in Allah and worship as they do are considered infidels. Most Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad (Holy war) against the infidels of the world. And that, by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are insured a place in heaven. </p>
<p>People who study the Quran (Koran) say that this is not exactly what it teaches and that in the Koran, it is also taught, the taking of an innocent life is condemned. And that the actions of some Muslims should not condemn the whole religion.</p>
<p>From what I see around the world today this is very definitely a violent religion. And I do not find this mandate in Christianity or Judaism. If Islam only promotes peace and tolerance, how do they justify their obtrusive, uncaring attitude to their neighbors in Paris? They can not and could care less. They are, no doubt, on a mission to take over the city.</p>
<p>If this were not so they wouldn&rsquo;t be threatening the life of the person filming them. I wish the French people well in their fight to reclaim their streets and city from these barbarians.</p>
<p>And America needs to WAKE UP before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>

		<p>There appears to be three main components to this nonsense throughout western countries. The first component consists of some immigrant group with an invasive agenda. The second component consists of the common people who oppose their invasive agenda. And the third component consists of a group of political, academic and media elites who appear to actually support the invasive agenda. The first two components&rsquo; motives are pretty obvious. It&rsquo;s that last component&rsquo;s motive that I can&rsquo;t figure out.</p>

		<p>This is a scene which will be coming to a community near you. Look at the inroads they&rsquo;ve already made in this country: 5 years ago few Americans were even aware of the Muslim population, and it was steeped in mystery. Now it&rsquo;s a common daily topic of discussion among virtually all Americans. They&rsquo;re moving fast, people.</p>

		<p>#12 - You bring up a very good point; however, we don&rsquo;t know the full plans of the powers-that-be. A muslim population would be easier for them to dominate than a Christian or even modern secular one. Muslims slavishly devote themselves to their imams. .so maybe pushing this faux religion is just another step toward absolute power over man?</p>
<p>Or, they will use them as pawns to make people so scared that they willingly become slaves of the state. When you are dealing with madmen, it&rsquo;s hard to tell what they are going to do.</p>

Muslim immigration is threatening to overtake France for one reason.<br/>
The ruling elite want to return to a time when the people had been under their control.<br/>
Since the ruling elite had established wealth before all Frenchman, and  wealth is considered the payoff for surviving<br/>
their competitors, they are taking the next step by implementing what amounts to a human eugenics program against whites so that they will one day finish their business and join other elites throughout Europe and North America, Asia, and the Middle East, in a new adventure as gods CEO.<br/>

Correct. That&rsquo;s the official Marxist ideology.  But it&rsquo;s not the French people. It&rsquo;s the French Left, which has held just about absolute control (ideologically) since 1936 (briefly exempting the war years).  It tolerates no resistance, and makes life hell for those who would dissent. So much for democracy! After 1945, it mopped up any resistance and the remnants of the Right went into hiding or ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Sarkozy today is passed off to the public as a &#8220;right-wing&#8221; politician. That&rsquo;s a joke!  He&rsquo;s simply on the right end of the Left. For all practical purposes, <i>there is no Right. </i> It&rsquo;s not allowed.</p>

		<p>I just read today that a decree to kill Geert Wilders was issued by some typically crazed imam out of Australia. I have a feeling this kind of blood-thirstiness is going to produce a backlash, as even leftist parliamentarians must feel threatened. My only question is how do the Europeans stand it? They&rsquo;re getting kicked every other day it seems.</p>

What is Australia going to do about it?   Are they going to boot him out, or just helplessly tolerate it?</p>

		<p>And don&rsquo;t think that decree issued against Geert Wilders wasn&rsquo;t at least suggested by his leftist opponents acting in concert with their Islamic partners in crime.</p>

		<p>re 11:</p>
<p>Most Muslims in Europe are non competetive and receive some form of welfare.<br/>
Virtually none pay enough taxes to balance the government assistance they receive.</p>
<p>If European governments curtail the welfare largesse, many will leave, and many who stay will reduce their fertility.</p>
<p>Inducing Muslims to work &amp; participate in the society rather than cashing a gov. check would also impel many to assimilate and learn a European language (you would simply not believe how many Muslims here simply cannot speak a European language after 10,20,30 years here: they know as little about Europe as someone living in Afghanistan!).</p>
<p>Since &#8220;racism&#8221; is unspeakable and illegal is Europe, many people are trying to reduce welfare as a covert anti-immigration measure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope it works.</p>
