			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dutch News, September 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The three parties on the verge of forming the Netherlands&rsquo; next government asked civil servants to investigate a number of far-reaching measures to curb immigration during the negotiation process, the NRC reports on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The aim of the measures was to &#8216;discourage immigration and, once in the Netherlands, slow down the build-up of rights&rsquo;, the paper says.</p>
<p>The paper bases its claims on talks with civil servants and coalition negotiation documents, it says. The right-wing VVD and anti-Islam PVV were behind most of the requests, the paper said.</p>
<p><b>Children</b></p>
<p>For example, civil servants were asked to look at the idea of refusing to grant residency permits to non-married partners or to people who did not have a &#8216;strong economic and social connection&rsquo; to the Netherlands. Stopping children over the age of 15 from joining their parents was another option.</p>
<p>It is not yet known what measures the new government plans to adopt but it is clear immigration faces new curbs, the paper said.</p>
<p>In terms of asylum policy, the parties discussed prioritising cases involving families with children. This is because the longer their cases take, the more likely they are to get a permit in the interests of the child, the paper said.<br>

		<p>For the last few decades all the developed Western countries have been unanimous on the benefits of immigration and diversity. Criticism was not allowed and could not be allowed. It&rsquo;s been a united front. Now cracks are appearing all over. I argue that there is no middle ground on issues like immigration. On national defence, education, taxation, etc. there is middle ground but not on immigration. We&rsquo;ll have to see if the Dutch influence other countries or the other countries beat down the Dutch. One or the other.</p>
<p>The same goes for these civil servants. It&rsquo;s been standard practise for every bureaucrat to mouth golden words about immigration and diversity. I guess it goes with the job: if you have to deal with them every day your sanity depends on being positive about them. Watch for the civil servants to turn sour now as the political breeze changes direction.</p>

		<p>ALL nonwhite immigration into White nations needs to be stopped pronto! Complete separation of the Whites from the nonwhites need to be implemented pronto or else we will not survive this onslaught that our enemies from within has brought upon us. </p>
<p>  What good has ever come of nonwhite immigration? Please don&rsquo;t say, Oprah, etc! What a joke. NOTHING but bad things for our countries and our race has come of it. Look at America as one example of the foolhardy nonwhite immigration act&hellip;  </p>

		<p>&#8220;open immigration can&rsquo;t coexist with a strong social safety net; if you&rsquo;re going to assure health care and a decent income to everyone, you can&rsquo;t make that offer global.&#8221;<br>

European Social Democracy has only worked in countries where nearly everyone was white, of European descent.  European Social Democrats had better recognize this before it is too late.  </p>
