<h1><a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51340420100907">Detroit, Los Angeles Most Stressful U.S. Cities</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bernd Debusmann, Jr., Reuters, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit, Los Angeles and Cleveland are the most stressful cities in America, according to a new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Detroit has a lot of things going against it. It topped nearly all our standards for our stress test, although it was rarely number one,&#8221; said Portfolio.com editor J. James Moss. &#8220;Across the board, it was bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riverside in California and St. Louis in Missouri rounded out the top five stressful cities.</p>
<p>Portfolio.com, a national business and news website for small business executives, looked at unemployment rates, personal finance data, environmental, health and living standards and crime rates to compile the ranking of 50 cities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Moss] added that the list was done using statistical data analysis, rather than interviews with local residents about their levels of stress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York City captured the No. 6 spot, followed by New Orleans, Chicago, Birmingham and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale Salt Lake City was ranked as the least stressful city, thanks to its low crime rates, high health standing and employment, and its easy commutes.</p>
<p>Virginia Beach in Virginia, and Minneapolis-St.Paul also scored high for their low-stress living.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other less stressful cities included Raleigh in North Carolina, Austin in Texas, Denver, San Antonio and Kansas City.</p>
<p>Moss noted that stress levels seem to be increasing across America&rsquo;s major cities for a variety of factors, most notably the economy.</p>

High stress city= large black population<br>
Low stress city = large white population</p>
<p>Where ever and I mean EVER there is a large black population there is a large number of murders, rapes and robberies. But saying so would be racist.</p>

		<p> &#8220;it was rarely number one,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would have to imagine that a lot of the folks in Dee are normally so stoned day and night they rarely even are aware of what is going on around them. NOTHING bothers them because they have found a way not be BOTHERED!</p>
<p>At least, that is my intuitive perception.</p>

		<p>Let me guess, they did not use the &#8220;diversity&#8221; of the population as a measure of how stressful a city is to live in. Nor did they use the presence or absence of gangs, or the violence they commit against whites. Those are major determinants in how stressful or not a city is for whites. If you have to worry about being robbed, raped or killed constantly, how can that not make your life stressful?<br>

<p>Are Detroit, Cleveland, and LA stressed out because the Dodgers, Tigers, and Indians aren&rsquo;t playing well?</p>
<p>Or is the survey &#8216;shaded&rsquo; in a way that &#8216;colors&rsquo; the results?</p>

		<p>Los Angeles is horrible, but it has vastly improved in the last 25 years as the hispanics have driven out the blacks, especially in affirmative action government work.</p>
<p>Hispanics preform their jobs in a competent manner.  They behave decently in the workplace, no more drama and intrigue and vicious fighting.  They do commit crimes but they do not drive 10 miles to find a White neighborhood to rob rape and murder as the blacks used to do.   </p>
<p>While the blacks ruled the most unsafe areas were within about 4 blocks of a freeway off ramp.  The blacks would get off the freeway, rape rob or murder the first White they could find and get right back on the freeway.  Hispanics don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

		<p>San Antonio? Less stressful? For who? Oh, they must mean less stressful for the 850,000 Mexicans who live there and hold an annual twenty-day celebration in honor of Mexican independence.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/38qpdcn</p>
<p>Mexico continues to fight the Mexican-American War by other than military means, but we do not. As a result, they have taken back much of the Southwest. Eventually, when the U.S. splits along racial lines, maybe &#8220;Remember the Alamo&#8221; and San Antonio will make for a good learning example of why immigration is a bad thing.</p>

		<p>I am certain that the reporter was aware of the obvious correlation between stressfulness and the percentage of blacks and Hispanics.  But he knew he would be fired if he spelled it out so he kept quiet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget the Lions, the Browns, and oh yea, LA doesn&rsquo;t have a team anymore. Winning the Superbowl probably took new Orleans down a spot or two. </p>
<p>Gee, Salt lake City is one of the least stressful, wonder why? I&rsquo;ve heard that they are the only major metro area in the US where the inner city schools are still predominantly white. Even if you are a religious minority in a predominantly Mormon area, you can generally walk around the neighborhoods in relative safety. Being proselytized may be annoying, but it is not the same as being mugged. I&rsquo;ve walked away from the two nice clean cut men without one of them &#8220;bustin a cap in my (backside)&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Is Rich Benjamin of &#8220;Whitopia&#8221; fame going to head out again and see how stressful places like St. George, Utah are? Even if the economy is in the tank in one of these areas, the people there usually aren&rsquo;t in fear of their neighbors. Maybe where I live qualifies as a Whitopia, but the major metro area down the road does not. </p>
<p>Some time ago, I had the occasion to attend a track meet between the local middle school and a middle school from the city. On the city team on a 14 yo black male who looked 21 and had a tattoo on his arm. Needless to say, he decimated a bunch of gawky 13 &amp; 14 yo white kids. This is why I&rsquo;m steering my kids to swimming. </p>
<p>&#8220;Denise Larsen moved to the St. George area from Milwaukee with her husband and young daughters in 1997. &#8220;When we heard the gang shootings, we thought &#8216;It&rsquo;s time to move,&rsquo;&#8221; Denise tells me over soda pop at Wendy&rsquo;s. &#8220;This kid tried to leave a gang; they shot up his dad down the block from us. I guess you don&rsquo;t try and leave a gang. We could no longer let our kids ride their bikes around. Here, they could ride all the way down to the Virgin River, and we don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&#8221; For a mother frustrated with having her daughters bused across town due to a desegregation order, fed up with shoveling snow, and terrified of the gunshots ringing out, her new, Whitopian community is the perfect elixir.&#8221; (from an NPR web site about Mr. Benjamin&rsquo;s book)</p>
<p>The previous passage certainly doesn&rsquo;t describe Detroit or Gary. </p>

<p>The short answer is there are not enough of us. We not only have to deal with nonwhites, who have their eyes on the prize 100% of the time, but self loathing guilt-ridden whites. For example, I check out a blog dealing with music and the folks on there, pretty much all white, bend over backwards in expressing their left wing, white self defeating politics. They have no historical awareness of what hardships and struggles we have overcome as a people to get to the advanced (and definitely not perfect-life will never be perfect at least here on earth) and tenuous position we are in now.  </p>

		<p>Graham #10, I will reply.  Most Americans are NOT pushed around by the PC crowd.  Most of us are race-realists who ethnically self-segregate, speak our minds about issues, and vote according to our beliefs.  Even the most conservative MSM don&rsquo;t fully represent us, and the leftist echo chamber scarcely knows we exist.  People are finally doing what you suggest: being counted.  If the establishment political parties don&rsquo;t represent us, we can vote anti-establishment.  And, to judge by the last elections, we are in large measure.</p>

<p>Hah! We&rsquo;ve still gotta a long way to go to catch up to Detroit, but after a few more Herenton/Wharton terms, Memphis will get it&rsquo;s due. The only good thing about this is seeing urban blacks run out of white&rsquo;s to blame for their deplorable conditions, since the whites left the city en mass starting in 1991.     </p>
