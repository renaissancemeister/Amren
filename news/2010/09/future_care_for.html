<h1>Future Care for Uninsured Dialysis Patients in Question</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Teegardin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While the agreement eased concerns for those patients, most of them illegal immigrants, it does not address the dilemma of the future: What happens to the next wave of uninsured patients facing kidney failure?</p>
<p>Grady closed its outpatient dialysis unit in October to help it balance its books. The hospital said the unit was losing $4 million a year serving about 100 patients.</p>
<p>Most Americans with end-stage renal disease are covered by Medicare. Illegal immigrants, and some legal immigrants new to the country, are not eligible for the program.</p>
<p>Grady does not screen patients based on immigration status, and it treats uninsured patients, whether they are U.S. citizens or illegal residents. Immigration status has figured into the dialysis issue because illegal immigrants make up the bulk of those who need dialysis and do not qualify for Medicare coverage.</p>
<p>Uninsured patients can get emergency dialysis treatments at Grady or other hospitals. But with the Grady safety net gone for outpatient dialysis, those needing regular treatments to survive have few options. They can try to persuade a private clinic to offer charity care, which experts say will be difficult, or they can resort to irregular care in emergency rooms when their life is threatened.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many Americans oppose taxpayer-funded care for illegal immigrants, arguing that the care is an expensive drain on already limited public health resources.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Grady offered last year to pay travel expenses of displaced patients who wanted to return to their home countries, and 13 patients accepted. Grady also agreed to pay for care at local dialysis clinics, which most patients accepted. The contract with the private company that provided the care was to expire this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how firm the agreement is. DaVita Inc., one of the nation&rsquo;s largest dialysis providers, is working with community leaders to resolve the issue, said company spokesman James N. &#8220;Skip&#8221; Thurman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Leslie Spry, a kidney specialist from Nebraska who is a spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation, said the problem is a national one.</p>
<p>In states with heavy immigration, Spry said, &#8220;they&rsquo;re being inundated with these kind of folks, and they just turn the people away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spry said that even in Nebraska, it&rsquo;s becoming a common dilemma. He said the nonprofit dialysis clinic where he works offers charity care to some illegal immigrants without coverage, but only to those with community support and the willingness to pay what they can.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As more uninsured Americans gain coverage through the implementation of the nation&rsquo;s health care overhaul, illegal immigrants, who are not eligible for the program, are expected to make up a growing share of the remaining uninsured.</p>

<p>How about send these people home and start enforcing our immigration laws?Mexico has a socialized medical system, which does NOT treat Americans or any non-Mexican for free, especially for something serious. Let these people use their OWN system. Having them here compromises care for Americans. Oh, wait I forgot, Americans don&rsquo;t count.</p>

When ObamaCare kicks in, you can be sure all the illegals that aren&rsquo;t supposed to be covered will be. That&rsquo;s a sure bet.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m looking forward to is when the millions of Americans who demanded universal health care discover it itsn&rsquo;t free.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many Americans oppose taxpayer-funded care for illagal immigrants&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course we do!! For Heavens&rsquo; sake - what sane person wouldn&rsquo;t oppose being robbed blind in broad daylight! And what kind of individual sneaks into a country not their own and expects free medical care anyway?</p>
<p>All this is complete madness! It is good that Americans are beginning to wake up and see what has really been going on right under their collective noses for years. I always said, the only thing that would start to wake White America from its slumber would be some kind of financial mentdown or major economic issues of some sort. That reality has come to pass, and more and more are starting to see the light&hellip;at least a little bit. Where we go from here is the big question.</p>

		<p>The idea that an illegal alien has a right to use an emergency room for free is ingrained in the corporate bureaucracy that runs hospitals. Costs are shifted to insurance companies of legal residents who then pay higher rates. The solution is ruthless, but opponents of Obama cant just scream government doesn&rsquo;t run health care as well as the private sector. The private sector treats illegals and finds ways to charge legal Americans more to pay for illegals. Doctors basically do the same; many offices in the suburbs feature Spanish babbling large families. If they are legal, why does no one in the large group speak English and why are doctors hiring more Hispanic speakers as receptionists and even nurses? </p>
<p>PC ideas, including diversity and &#8216;every culture is equally valid&rsquo; have infected the private sector, and not only the &#8220;nonprofit&#8221; organizations. Patriotism is unknown by the vast majority of the post-Vietnam generations; it is treated with contempt by Corporate America. Change the corporations, you&rsquo;ll change the goverment. But the market is a world market now, and nationalism means nothing to the preponderance of businesses in America.</p>
<p>We need a new Constitution.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth thinking through the chain of consequences acted out in stories like these:</p>
<p>When uninsured illegal immigrants end up needing intensive medical care like dialysis, we can see at least two different &#8220;systemic&#8221; forces at work:</p>
<p>One is that we see a Mexican oligarchy which either can&rsquo;t run Mexico competently or refuses to in order to enrich itself even more (Mexican oligarchs are among the richest thanks to Mexico&rsquo;s oil). As a result, Mexico&rsquo;s poor get dumped on American middle class taxpayers.</p>
<p>The second is that the wealthy elite in this country import these cheap workers and then don&rsquo;t provide them health benefits. Doing so would raise the prices of vegetables, janitorial services, etc. (or is that it would cut into profits?). The end result is that American middle class taxpayers end up paying for their health care. </p>
<p>Those vegetables weren&rsquo;t so cheap after all, were they?</p>
