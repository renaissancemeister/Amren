<h1>African Immigrants Make Mark on Brooks Election</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Seskus, Calgary Herald, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brooks is a pioneer city steeped in cowboy history, but shaped more recently by the thousands of new Canadians who have come to build a life for themselves on the prairies.</p>
<p>This fall, two African-Canadian immigrants each hope to take the next step by making a bid to sit on city council, a significant moment for the century-old community two hours southeast of Calgary.</p>
<p>Born in East Africa, Ahmed Kassem arrived in Canada more than 20 years ago. Today, he&rsquo;s an assistant safety manager at Lakeside Packers and co-founder of an organization that strives to build bridges between new arrivals and the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am running because I want to make a difference in society,&#8221; says Kassem, who wants to help grow the city and hopes his efforts will inspire others. &#8220;I am very confident my message will relate to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Nuul Mayen was a refugee of Sudan&rsquo;s bloody civil war, which claimed nearly two million lives. He arrived in Canada with little more than a bag in 1998. Today, he&rsquo;s executive director of a local language centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came with nothing, but I got something,&#8221; Mayen says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time to give it back to the country that nurtured and gave me something.&#8221;</p>
<p>By all accounts, this is the first time African-Canadian immigrants have made a bid for Brooks council.</p>
<p>Their candidacies are an exciting development for Maureen Chelemu, a pastor at Brooks International Gospel Church and an immigrant from Zambia.</p>
<p>Her hope is that as councillors, Kassem and Mayen would help improve understanding, give new Canadians a greater sense of ownership in their community and bring fresh a perspective to council.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s exactly what a community is all about, right? To make a better community,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You bring an idea, I bring an idea and then all of us must have that ownership.&#8221;</p>
<p>If elected, Kassem and Mayen would add another chapter in the community&rsquo;s history, in which immigration has played a huge part.</p>
<p>More than a century ago, the Brooks area was a hunting ground for First Nations people.</p>
<p>In the late 1880s, European immigrants began to move to the area to farm. More homesteaders arrived as the railroad pushed westward.</p>
<p>A more recent wave of newcomers  &mdash;  mostly refugees from Africa  &mdash;  came about 10 or 15 years ago with a number taking hard-to-fill jobs in the beef-processing industry.</p>
<p>Today, roughly 20 per cent of Brooks&rsquo; 13,500 residents are new immigrants, with a mother tongue other than English or French.</p>
<p>A visitor these days might hear Filipino, Spanish or Arabic. Indeed, the multicultural community is very much like Canada in miniature.</p>
<p>Yet, local politics  &mdash;  like so many other Alberta communities, including Calgary  &mdash;  has not exactly mirrored that same diversity.</p>
<p>That could change when the ballots are counted on Oct. 18.</p>
<p>Lloyd Wong, a sociologist who studies immigration at the University of Calgary, believes news of two African-Canadian immigrant candidates in Brooks is significant.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you run for office, that&rsquo;s a sign of what I would call active citizenship,&#8221; Wong says.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s what democracy is about. So, to me, that&rsquo;s a success story that they would want to run and see that they can potentially help make Brooks a better place to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wong also believes it speaks well of the entire Brooks community, &#8220;in the sense that there&rsquo;s encouragement for immigrants to be active.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brooks Mayor Martin Shields applauds anyone willing to stand for public office, whether &#8220;you&rsquo;ve been in the community all your life, whether you&rsquo;re new or (been here) 20 years from a different culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>A total of 13 candidates are vying for six councillor spots. Kassem and Mayen are distinct candidates with their own platforms.</p>
<p>Kassem says it would be an honour to be elected and serve the community. And there&rsquo;s little question that he&rsquo;s passionate about Brooks.</p>
<p>He speaks of the importance of attracting and keeping Brooks residents so that the city can grow and prosper economically.</p>
<p>If elected, &#8220;I will be representing the whole residents of Brooks and their interests, you can be sure of that,&#8221; says Kassem, who also hosts a local radio program promoting cultural understanding.</p>
<p>For his part, Mayen says he is running on a platform of &#8220;open, transparent and inclusive representation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees his election bid as a way to contribute to his Canadian home.</p>
<p>Mayen was one of Sudan&rsquo;s thousands of &#8220;lost boys&#8221; who were displaced or orphaned during the Second Sudanese Civil War.</p>
<p>After arriving in Canada, he pursued his education and graduated from the University of Winnipeg in 2007 with a degree in international development studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am running as a Canadian citizen,&#8221; Mayen says. &#8220;I felt this is something I should do, something to give back to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The candidates are a hot topic in local coffee shops, according to former mayor Don Weisbeck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Municipal politics may be more talked (about) than it has been in years,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;They certainly represent a substantial part of our population and it&rsquo;s good to see &hellip; them running.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the streets, the news also seems to be largely welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see why (Brooks) shouldn&rsquo;t move ahead on something like this,&#8221; says Catherine Burk, who has lived in the area since 1970.</p>
<p>Kashif Mushtaq, a resident of Pakistani origin, believes Kassem&rsquo;s candidacy &#8220;will be good for the community and for the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the campaign trail will be full of challenges, especially in a competitive field for a council seat. And some minds will be difficult to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always have the diehards,&#8221; adds longtime resident and cabbie Alan Skretting. &#8220;The ones who have lived here their whole lives and don&rsquo;t want to see change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been in the area all my life. I thought it a little early to begin with, but I find good and bad in all cultures, eh? So, I am for it.&#8221;<br>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/09/24/herman-cain-former-godfathers-pizza-ceo-is-contemplating-2012-run/" rel="nofollow">http://dailycaller.com/2010/09/24/herman-cain-former-godfathers-pizza-ceo-is-contemplating-2012-run/</a></p>
<p>An excerpt from article</p>
<p>&#8220;Cain hosts a daily radio show in Georgia and travels regularly with an aide to Tea Party events, where he&rsquo;s cultivating a fan base. At one bus stop Thursday, a woman held up a &ldquo;Cain 2012&rdquo; sign. At another event, a woman wore a shirt with the same message.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please notice that he he USING the Tea Partiers as a base to get elected. Of course the stupid neocon Whites will vote and support him. They love him to pieces!  They are even worse than the left I am beginning to believe. Same thing is happening in CA.and blacks being promoted by the GOP here also&hellip;local talk show hosts (White traitorous neocon) is sooooo happy that the GOP has finally getting people of color to run for office! </p>
<p>Believe me, the neocons are the worst when it comes to White racial awareness. I hear them everyday and it makes me sick.</p>

		<p>Im an Albertan oil worker and I can tell you all these foreigners they brought here during the boom where looked down upon. Now that there&rsquo;s a recession everyone you hear wants to send them home but of course the government will just bring more. Everyone I know that goes down to Brooks for work says its a dump from the Africans they keep bringing in. Even 10 years ago you barely seen a black in Edmonton now they&rsquo;re even in some small towns! &hellip;Dating white chicks of course! Couldn&rsquo;t have been any other way</p>

		<p>Big thanks to the American company Lakeside Packers for importing all these black Africans.</p>
<p>As the large population of blacks has come into the small community crime has sky rocketed.</p>
<p>Drug dealers.</p>
<p>Yes they should go back to Africa and make a difference there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want them and don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>Any white person living in Brooks should be making all efforts to leave even if they are selling their home at a loss.</p>
<p>But while they are still there they better get out and vote and keep them out of council chambers.</p>
<p>What a shame, what was once a beautiful small prairie town well on the way to becoming a third world hell hole.</p>

Diversity works when superior individuals participate. Unfortunately, that is the only time it works.  <br>
 <br>
Superiority is innate. It cannot be created by social reform and social welfare spending.   <br>

		<p><i>&ldquo;I am running because I want to make a difference in society,&rdquo; says Kassem, who wants to help grow the city and hopes his efforts will inspire others.</i></p>
<p>That phrase, &#8220;I want to make a difference,&#8221; especially in context of gaining or winning some sort of sinecure, is a piece of linguistic linguini that really bothers me.  And it bothers me more and more the older I get.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not old by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems that once you have thirty safely in your rearview mirror, some old folks hormones start kicking in.  Around two years ago, a rookie cop in St. Louis City was shot and killed in the line of duty, 23 years old and black, and the doer was 15 and black.  In the following days, the local eyeball TV news interviewed the cop&rsquo;s surviving family members, and one of them said that he said he wanted to become a cop in STL City &#8220;in order to make a difference&#8221; in the lives of young black men.</p>
<p>I caught myself being an old geezer at that very moment   &mdash;   I yelled out at the TV:  &#8220;You little conceited SOB.  There are like 1500 or so city cops now, thousands who have been city cops.  And you, the conceited youth that you were, thought that you were the only one who thought he could make a difference?  What an arrogant and youthfully conceited thing to think.  Don&rsquo;t you think that if a &#8216;difference&rsquo; could be made, it would have been made by now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, that was a horrible thing to think about someone recently murdered.</p>
<p>A few days later, one of the local eyeball newscasts interviewed an author of a book.  The author is one David Klinger, and the book is <i>Into the Kill Zone.</i>  One of his contentions, he told eyeball news, is that in the universe of &#8220;urban&#8221; cops killed in the line of duty, with the perps being habitual urban thugs or those who were well on their way to being such, the young rookies who approach law enforcement with the youthfully conceited attitude of &#8220;wanting to make a difference, to be a positive role model&#8221; are far more likely to be killed than the hardened veterans and the stereotypical &#8220;bad rumps&#8221; (polite form).  In other words, the hardened vets gave up their &#8220;making a difference&#8221; delusion long ago, because they know a difference could never be made.  (At least not in the starry-eyed sense.)</p>
<p>So, I read this Kassem flake wants to win election to the city council because he &#8220;wants to make a difference.&#8221;  What he&rsquo;s saying, but probably doesn&rsquo;t know it, is that he&rsquo;s the only one who ever thought to be on the Brooks, Alberta city council to make a difference   &mdash;   All those old, boring, stuffy white Canadians who ran for the Brooks city council in the past must have been nothing but money hungry crooks.  (Hey, crooks in Brooks.  It rhymes.)  Now, this Kassem is probably in no danger of being murdered in the line of &#8220;duty,&#8221; but the conceit is there nonetheless.</p>

		<p>Click the link &#8220;original article&#8221; above to view a photo of the African in small town Canada who is going to &#8220;<i>make a difference</i>&#8221; in our country. One wonders how hard-working European settlers and their following generations managed to successfully carve a first-world economy out of the wild west without his help. </p>
<p>Anyhow, that disengenuous phrase was borrowed from the Obama presidential campaign because it apparently worked for him. So now, a couple of transplanted African immigrants can only hope that gullible Canadians will fall for the same meaningless slogan and vote them into office, too.    </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not be coy here; these out-of-place Black African immigrants are looking at their rising immigrant population numbers and see a delicious opportunity in snatching a council seat away from a white Canadian in a formerly <a href="http://www.brooks.ca/" rel="nofollow"><b>all-white town</b></a>, and hopefully with 96% of the recently-arrived Black ethnic vote. (Sound familiar?) </p>
<p>As often said, &#8220;<i>if Americans had picked pick their own cotton</i>&#8221;. Well, now it can be said in modern-day Canada, &#8220;<i>if Canadians had cut their own beef</i>!!</p>
<p>If Albertans haven&rsquo;t learned any history from their American cousins&rsquo; mistakes by time, they&rsquo;ll likely learn how block voting and racial-ethnic politics can destroy a community very quickly.  </p>

		<p>Good post anonymous at 11:02 - That&rsquo;s exactly what these black Africans are thinking about these elections. Right now they&rsquo;ve got to play the &#8220;friendly African&#8221; role because they&rsquo;re a small minority, but as their numbers grow they&rsquo;ll turn into a Robert Mugabe. As I&rsquo;ve posted before, why is it they never thought about &#8220;making a difference&#8221; when they were in Africa? </p>

<p>What this fool doesn&rsquo;t realize is that the city will eventually turn into a muslim town and HE will be ostracized by those muslims.

Way to lean on the laziest of multiculti cliches, Hoser! Yeah, there&rsquo;s good and bad in all cultures   &mdash;   but obviously not all <i>in the same proportions</i>, eh? </p>
<p>In fact, in NOWHERE NEAR the same proportions, eh?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reason Alberta isn&rsquo;t poor and violent like Africa, eh?</p>
