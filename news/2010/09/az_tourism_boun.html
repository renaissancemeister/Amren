			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca L. McClay Cronkite, Arizona Daily Star (Tucson), September 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At FireSky Resort and Spa, Jim Hollister&rsquo;s inbox swelled with e-mails from guests demanding cancellations just after SB 1070 became law.</p>
<p>But the general manager of the luxury resort said business has been pleasantly brisk lately as fewer customers seem fazed by Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kristen Jarnagin, vice president of communications for the Arizona Tourism Alliance, expects that the worst of SB 1070&rsquo;s effect on Arizona&rsquo;s tourism industry has passed.</p>
<p>When the boycott on tourism was rescinded, it was the beginning of the end to the deterioration of the state brand, she said.</p>
<p>Still, she cautioned, &#8220;It&rsquo;s difficult to know what the long-term impacts will be, because when meetings book, they usually book two or three years out. So this could impact us for the next three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s tourism industry lost upward of $15 million when more than 40 groups canceled hotel stays in protest of SB 1070, said Jarnagin. The lost revenue doesn&rsquo;t include groups that may have considered booking but never made reservations, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Booking rates in Arizona hotels are up over 2009, but those increases lag slightly behind the national rebound, DeRaad said.</p>

<p>First off, I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s entirely true.  Whenever leftists boycott a state, such as SC for the Confed. Flags, the media trumpet every hotel cancellation as a &#8220;success&#8221; for the boycott.  It might be that some of these reservations were cancelled b/c of the economy.</p>
<p>Second, what about the other direction?  What of reservations made BECAUSE of SB 1070?  What of Arizonans who stayed in the state instead of spending long summer weekends in, e.g. San Diego?  (Phoenix and Tucson empty out during summer weekends, especially three-day ones, as a lot of people spend the weekend some place cooler.)</p>

		<p>$15,000,000 is the cost of redecorating the governor&rsquo;s office every four years, an insignificant amount.  How much did the state save by scaring some of the Mexicans away?  A lot more than this piddling sum.  </p>

<p>We&rsquo;re other groups booked after the cancellation?  Were any of the other tourist draws in Arizona operating normally or above average?  How many of the alleged cancellations were the result of a devastating drop in the economy?  Businesses were hit brutally hard, and still are, so how much of this &#8220;drop&#8221; can be attributed to the economy, if there was truly a loss at all. There&rsquo;s a hundred other aspects to cover financially when an accounting or audit is made.</p>
<p>Too, I don&rsquo;t believe the boycott had any kind of real impact at all.  There&rsquo;s so much lying going on by the leftists and closet radicals constantly, it&rsquo;s difficult to trust any kind of figures coming out unless they&rsquo;re comprehensive and can be attributed to someone trustworthy.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity makes a good point. I also wonder what costs might have been allayed because certain groups stayed away. That needs to be factored in as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very hard, of course, to get accurate figures on something like this. How many hotel cancellations were DIRECTLY due to SB 1070? And, assuming the amount of LOST revenue could be confidently calculated (which it can&rsquo;t), it would then need to be balanced against the amount GAINED by pro-1070 tourists who changed their travel plans to INCLUDE Arizona. </p>
<p>How about comparing the number of visitors to the Grand Canyon this summer as opposed to previous summers? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a more reliable guide to the truth of the situation? Surely somebody in AZ&rsquo;s state gov must keep track of Canyon stats, so let&rsquo;s have a look at them. </p>
<p>My own guesstimate   &mdash;   and based on what I said above, a guesstimate is all it can be   &mdash;   is that whatever AZ lost in cancellations from the PC would mostly mostly compensated for by increased visits by the non-PC. </p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a further guesstimate: As previous posters have noted, WHATEVER the dollar-loss might be (assuming it&rsquo;s a loss at all), that amount will be more than made up for by the savings to the state in not having to feed/house/educate/incarcerate quite so many illegals. Whatever THAT figure might be   &mdash;   and I myself wouldn&rsquo;t even try to put a number on it   &mdash;   it is certain to be MUCH bigger than the &#8220;$15 million loss&#8221; (a pretty insignificant sum, under the circumstances) claimed by this liberal Tucson newspaper. </p>
<p>Bottom line: I predict SB 1070 will be, long-term, a very large NET GAIN for AZ. Economically, it prove be a plus, not a minus. </p>
<p>Also, it will have the additional benefit of keeping the Grand Canyon State under AMERICAN control, rather than <i>de facto</i> Mexican control. And THAT&rsquo;S a benefit that is literally PRICELESS!<br>
