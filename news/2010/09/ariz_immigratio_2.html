Immigration Law&rsquo;s Legal Costs Could Top $1&nbsp;Million</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ginger Rough, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Defending the state against lawsuits related to its tough new immigration law has cost more than $440,000 to date, and outstanding bills could easily add up to an excess of $1&nbsp;million or more.</p>
<p>The bills so far cover work and charges incurred only through the end of June, which doesn&rsquo;t include any costs related to a U.S. Department of Justice suit filed in July.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Money to pay for the state&rsquo;s legal costs is coming from Brewer&rsquo;s legal defense fund. So far she has authorized two expenditures: one for just over $77,000 to cover bills received for work in the last 11 days of May, and the second for $363,520.25 to cover the June legal charges.</p>
<p>The fund has received more than $3.6 million in donations to date, from 41,478 donors all across the country. A single donation in the amount of $1.5 million was received in the last two weeks from Timothy Mellon of Laramie, Wyo., Brewer&rsquo;s office said.</p>
<p>Public records show that Mellon is heir to a family banking fortune and is the chairman of Pan Am Systems, a privately-owned shipping and freight company based out of New Hampshire.</p>

		<p>The headline, IMO, implies the cost to Arizona is very high to defend itself against the USA and the open border crowd. Actually, the expense cited is cheap. If the costs far exceed one million, the cost is still cheap until it exceeds the costs of lost jobs, taxes, crime damage and education/health/welfare that illegals and their buddies in the &#8220;legal&#8221; immigrant community cause to the taxpayers of the US and of Arizona.</p>
<p>Bury the burritos in paper, knights of the pinstripe table!</p>
<p>We may not make clothing, steel or machine tools anymore in this nation, but we still have the leanest, meanest lawyers on Earth.</p>

		<p>Has anybody considered the possibility that Arizona and the 25 other states in the process of passing a similar law, plus other states who are not, but who are at odds with the feds, like Texas, might well write up an &#8220;Intent to Secede,&#8221; if the community organizer continues along this same path of totalitarianism?</p>
<p>They could well embark on the beginning of a war footing, holding all personal income tax payments destined for the feds and forminng international relations with other countries, while they quietly build a posse commitatus force deputizing large defensive forces, putting military bases under state jurisdiction, and obtaining vrtual control over any nuclear sites in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>TAKE NOTE!  This is a very real possibility that could VERY WELL occur after more totalitarianist abuse from this administration&rsquo;s arrogant, mentally challenged fools who are at odds with the constitution, threatening to destroy the very fabric of the United States.</p>
<p>It would be a last resort, but make no mistake about it it is indeed a likely possible necessity not lost on many governors and legislatures around the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plain to many with the intelligence to see that many states have initiated the first steps by declaring their sovereignty via various resolutions.</p>

		<p>As we all know, legal fees can be enormous. Also enormous? The cost to this country illegal immigration has generated. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Everyone who knows this is true, put your money where your mouth is and donate!</p>

		<p>I realize how much anger and despair is produced by seemingly unending Latin American pressure on the USA&rsquo;s resources, sense of identity and patience by illegal immigration. However, would it not be in our country&rsquo;s best interest to rationalize immigration through comprehensive change? We could build a fence but also &#8220;mend a fence&#8221; by registering those people who are desperate are come to the USA to escape the dreadful societies they are trapped in.<br>
Many of the worst crimes against illegals happen to them as they traverse Mexico; we should bring that up next time we hear demands from Calderone.<br>
Maybe too we could crack down on the epidemic of crime against Latins, and native white Americans, at the hands of gun-wielding criminals in our cities. The time has come when we had better start using federal government stimulus money to build huge new prisons to house offenders such as these, forever:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Boston police have arrested three suspects who they say stabbed a Domino&rsquo;s pizza delivery man and drove off in his car.</p>
<p>Two teenangers and a 20-year-old are charged with homicide in what investigators described as a brutal crime.</p>
<p>Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said 58-year-old Richel Nova&rsquo;s death &#8220;was chilling in its callousness and violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN affiliate WCVB reported that the three suspects broke into a vacant home Thursday night and then made a call for pizza to be delivered, according to police.</p>
<p>When Nova arrived, he was stabbed multiple times at the kitchen door, police said.</p>
<p>The group drove off in Nova&rsquo;s car, then left it in a church parking lot, WCVB reported, citing a police report. They took about $100 Nova was carrying   &mdash;   and the pizza   &mdash;   with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Richel Nova was a hard-working man, making an honest living to provide for his family when he was preyed upon by three vicious thugs,&#8221; Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis told reporters. &#8220;For a small amount of money, these suspects committed unspeakable acts of violence while showing Mr. Nova no mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friends told WCVB that Nova, a Dominican immigrant who moved to Massachusetts more than 20 years ago, worked three jobs to provide a better life for his son and twin 20-year-old daughters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a shame,&#8221; friend Rafael Hernandez told WCVB. &#8220;You come here to change your life and do better, and that&rsquo;s what happens to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michel Andre St. Jean, 20, Alexander Emmanuel Gallett, 18 and Yamiley Mathurin, 17 are accused of homicide, armed robbery and armed breaking and entering of a dwelling&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
