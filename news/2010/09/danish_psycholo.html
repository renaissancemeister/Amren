<h1><a href="http://europenews.dk/en/node/21789">Danish Psychologist: &#8220;Integration of Muslims in Western Societies Is Not Possible&#8221;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Felix Struening, EuropeNews, March 31, 2009</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Danish integration problems with Muslims became public worldwide in 2006 when the newspaper Jyllands-Posten published 12 cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Exactly two years later riots broke out again because of the reprint of the Mohammed cartoons by all major Danish newspapers.</p>
<p>Currently 70% of the prison population in the Copenhagen youth prison consists of young man of Muslim heritage. Is this recent violence and general violent tendency among Muslims solely coincidental, or is there a direct connection?</p>
<p>In February 2009, Nicolai Sennels, a Danish psychologist published a book entitled Among criminal Muslims. A psychologist&rsquo;s experience from Copenhagen. In his book, Nicolai Sennels shares a psychological perspective of this Muslim Culture, its relationship to anger, handling emotions and its religion. He based his research on hundreds of hours of therapy with 150 young Muslims in the Copenhagen youth jail. EuropeNews interviewed the author about his book and its consequences on integration of Muslims in Europe.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>Nicolai Sennels, how did you get the idea to write a book about criminal Muslims in Denmark?</p>
<p><b>Nicolai Sennels: </b>I got the idea in February 2008 during a conference on integration in Copenhagen, where I was invited as the first and only psychologist working in a Copenhagen youth prison. My speech at the conference was about the fact, that foreigners&rsquo; culture plays a significant role concerning integration, crime and religious extremism. I emphasized, that people from a Muslim culture find it difficult, if not impossible, to create a successful life in Denmark.</p>
<p>This statement was met with great resistance from Danish politicians and also my own boss from the youth prison. I was quite surprised since I thought that my point is obvious: some cultures fit better into Western societies than others. All of Europe is currently struggling to integrate Muslims but this endeavor seems to be impossible. According to the Danish police and the Danish Bureau of Statistics more than 70% of all crimes in the Danish capital are committed by Muslims. Our national bank recently published a report stating that a Muslim foreigner costs more than 2 million Danish kroner (300,000 euros) in federal social assistance on average, caused by the low participation in the work force. On top of this, we have to add many additional types of social welfare that unemployed people can receive in our country: expenses in connection with interpreters, special classes in school  &mdash;  64% of school children with Muslim parents cannot read and write Danish properly after 10 years in a Danish school  &mdash;  social work, extra police etc.</p>
<p>My statement resulted in a legal injunction, a kind of professional punishment, which stated, that if I ever repeat this, I could be fired. According to the Copenhagen authorities it is apparently permitted to state that the serious problems among Muslims are caused by poverty, the media, the police, the Danes, politicians, etc. But two things are definitely not allowed: 1) discussing the significance of culture and 2) our foreigners own responsibility for their integration in our societies. Unfortunately many very powerful politicians lack a clear understanding of the psychological aspect of culture and the influence it has on integration.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>What were the reactions in Denmark?</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>The book was received with a great amount of attention, already before the book was officially published on February 24 2009. It was on the front page of one of the biggest national newspapers in Denmark, and I was on the radio and TV participating in debates with politicians and other experts on the subject. The first publication of the book was sold out after three weeks.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been some big changes in Danish integration policy, which seems to have been influenced by the book and the attention it got. From my personal point of view, the widespread attention shows that my statement is true: there is simply a great need for a deeper understanding of how Muslims&rsquo; culture influences their chances for integration.</p>
<p>The very famous politician, Naser Khader, who is Muslim and the author of the bestseller &#8220;Honor and Shame&#8221;, wrote a review of my book and stated that it should be &#8220;obligatory reading for students, social workers and teachers.&#8221; Jyllands-Posten, the brave newspaper that first published the Mohammed cartoons, calls the book &#8220;an original piece of pioneer work&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at the book. You talk about four myths of integration. The first one concerns the difference between the cultures of immigrants.</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>What I discovered during my work at the youth prison was that people of Muslim heritage have other needs for social work than Danes or people of non-Muslim cultures. These different needs require more attention, and psychologists need to do more research on these topics in order to be able to create effective social politics.</p>
<p>I completely agree with my critics that personal and social problems can lead to anti-social behavior among both Westerners and Muslims. However, there is still extremely disproportional anti-social and anti-democratic behavior among Muslims. The Danish Bureau of Statistics published a report (1 and 2) stating that Muslim countries take the first eight places on the top 10-list of criminals&rsquo; country of origin. Denmark is number nine on this list.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>So that means, we have to treat Muslim and non-Muslim immigrants in a different way?</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>Seen from a psychological and also humanistic perspective, it is very clear that people from different cultures have different needs when they have or create problems. My own experience is that Muslims don&rsquo;t understand our Western way of trying to handle conflicts through dialogue. They are raised in a culture with very clear outer authorities and consequences. Western tradition using compromise and inner reflection as primary means of handling outer and inner conflicts is seen as weak in the Muslim culture. To a great extent they simply don&rsquo;t understand this softer and more humanistic way of handling social affairs. In the context of social work and politics this means that they need more borders and stronger consequences to be able to adjust their behavior.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>That leads us directly to the second myth: it is often said, that the criminality of immigrants is caused by social problems, not by their cultural background. In your book you disagree and point to the religion of the Muslims as a source of criminality.</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>Well, I would rephrase it as &#8220;Muslim culture&#8221; instead of &#8220;religion&#8221; because there are a lot of Muslims who don&rsquo;t know what is written in the Quran and who don&rsquo;t visit the mosques. But they are strongly influenced on a cultural level. And there we see that especially anger is much more accepted in the Muslim culture.</p>
<p>One example: in Western culture and also in other non-Muslim cultures, like in Asia, you see aggression and a sudden explosion of anger as something you&rsquo;ll regret afterwards, something you are ashamed of. It is completely opposite in the Muslim culture. If somebody steps on your honor  &mdash;  what I as a psychologist would call self confidence  &mdash;  you are simply expected to show aggression and often also verbal or physical revenge. So, aggression gives you a low status in our cultures, but a high status in the Muslim culture.</p>
<p>There is however another and much deeper reason for the wide spread anti-social behavior in Muslim communities and their strong aversion against integration  &mdash;  namely, the very strong identification that Muslims have with belonging to the Muslim culture.</p>
<p>My encounter with the Muslim culture has been a meeting with an exceedingly strong and very proud culture. This is certainly something that can ensure an ancient culture&rsquo;s survival through changing times  &mdash;  Islam and the Muslim culture are excellent examples of this. A strong and proud culture unfortunately also makes the culture&rsquo;s members almost unable to adapt to other values. In Germany, only 12% of their 3.5 million Muslims see themselves as more German than Muslim; in France and Denmark, only 14% of the Muslim populations respectively see themselves more as French or Danish than Muslim. Research among Muslims living in Denmark also shows that 50% of the 1st- and 2nd-generation immigrants are against free speech and 11% would like to see the Danish constitution exchanged with the sharia law (more numbers from this research can be found in the printed issue of the newspaper). These high percentages are of course frightening, but especially disturbing is the fact that there are no differences of opinion on this topic among Muslims who are born and raised in Muslim countries and the opinion of their children who are born and raised in Danish society. When it comes to identity among Muslims, nationality does not count at all in comparison with culture and religion. The consequence is a powerful and growing opposition to Western culture and values in Muslim ghettoes throughout Copenhagen and other major European cities.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>As you already pointed out, a lot of Muslims have a strong connection to their religious identity. The third myth you dismantle in your book is about the percentage of extremist&rsquo;s and fundamentalists among Muslims. It&rsquo;s often presumed that this percentage is relatively small. What is your experience?</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>People hope that most Muslims are modern and accept Western values. My experience is different, and this has been proven by the statistics in Europe that I just quoted. In February 2008, we had some deadly serious riots by young Muslims in Denmark.</p>
<p>Those riots were partly a reaction to the great focus by the Danish police on the steeply rising crime rates in Muslim areas. The other reason was the reprinting of the Mohammed cartoons in all Danish newspapers. This reprinting was an act of solidarity with the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, whose life was, and still is, seriously threatened.</p>
<p>In these riots, we saw Muslims who don&rsquo;t practice the Islamic religion in their daily lives standing up for their culture and religion in a very aggressive way. Copenhagen was smoking for an entire week due to several hundred of fires, and the police and firemen trying to calm the situation down were also attacked. A big part of the rioters ended up in the prison where I worked, and I therefore I had the chance to talk with them. Almost all of them were Muslims, and they all claimed that what they have done  &mdash;  starting fires, attacking the police etc.  &mdash;  was justified since Danish society, through its pressure on integration and through reprinting the Mohammed cartoons, has proven itself to be racist and against Islam and Muslim culture. The few Danish people among the rioters were completely different. Their explanation of their actions was predominately a search for adventure or excitement.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>The fourth myth is that poverty among immigrants leads to their bad social situation. In your book, you tell us that the opposite is true.</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>You can formulate this important question like this: do people get social problems because they are poor, or do they become poor because they create social problems? My experience is that the very low focus on supporting one&rsquo;s children in school and on one&rsquo;s own education and the lack of motivation for creating a professional career is a crucial factor for the poverty, which many Muslims experience in both our societies and in Muslim countries. On top of it, one fourth of all young male Muslims in Denmark have a criminal record. Poor reading skills, a strong aversion against authorities and a criminal record simply make it very difficult for you to get a well paying job. It is anti-social behavior that makes you poor. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many politicians see poverty as the main cause of integration problems. I think this is a horrible and one-dimensional view of poor people and of people in general. The idea that people&rsquo;s behavior is decided by the amount of money they have on their bank accounts every month is an exceedingly limited view. I myself, as a psychologist who graduated from the humanities department of the University of Copenhagen, would say that people have many more and stronger factors in their lives than money, which influence their behavior and way of thinking.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>What is the conclusion on your research? Is the integration of people of Muslim heritage into Western societies possible?</p>
<p><b>Nicolai Sennels: </b>I would say that the optimists, the people who say that integration is possible, carry a very great responsibility. There is a very great risk that they are selling us hope, a dream, that has no foundation in reality. This means that they will be the ones who are responsible for Europe looking away from and not addressing its problems until it is too late.</p>
<p>There is simply no research in Europe that supports the optimists&rsquo; view. On the contrary, all the research that we have on integration of Muslims in Western societies shows that we are continuing to head in the wrong direction. So I don&rsquo;t know how these optimists come to their conclusion. Maybe it is a vain and childish hope that everything will turn out well, just like in the fairy tales. Or maybe it is a pseudo-Darwinistic idea that everything will develop in a positive direction. One thing is for sure: they don&rsquo;t base their judgments on facts.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions but for the largest part integration to the necessary degree of Muslims is not possible. Clever and compassionate people are working all over Europe on the problem, and they have spent billions of Euros on the project, yet, the problems still continue to grow.</p>
<p>The psychological explanation is actually simple. The Muslim and the Western cultures are fundamentally very different. This means Muslims need to undergo very big changes in their identity and values to be able to accept the values of Western societies. Changing basic structures in one&rsquo;s personality is a very demanding psychological and emotional process. Apparently very few Muslims feel motivated to do so. I only know a few who managed, but I also know that it was a long and exhausting struggle on an inner level for them and that they often pay a high personal price on the outer level because their Muslim friends and families despise and/or disown them for leaving their culture.</p>
<p><b>EuropeNews: </b>But what we are going to do with the Muslims, who are already here?</p>
<p><b>Sennels: </b>I see two possibilities. Firstly, we should immediately stop all immigration of people from Muslim countries to Europe until we have proven that integration of Muslims is possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should help Muslims who don&rsquo;t want to or are not able to integrate in our Western societies to build a new and meaningful life in a society they understand and that understands them. This means to assist them in starting a new life in a Muslim country. We actually have the economic means to do this. As I mentioned previously, the Danish National Bank calculated, that every immigrant from Muslim countries costs 300,000 euros on average. With this money, we could help these people to live a happy life in a Muslim country without having to integrate in a society they don&rsquo;t understand and therefore cannot accept. Having money enough to support one&rsquo;s family and live in a country where one feels at home with the surrounding culture would be a great step forward in the quality of their lives. And we should help them achieve this. Not only the individual Muslim, but also European societies will benefit. Muslims immigrating from Europe to Muslim countries will function as ambassadors for more free and democratic societies: due to their experience from living in a democracy with real human rights and their knowledge of the social systems in Europe, they will take very important ideas and values with them. In this way they can do what hopefully most of them dream of, i.e. help their Muslim brothers and sisters in their home countries by changing the poor conditions and from which they moved away from initially.<br>

		<p>I think that is what it comes down to, are Europeans wasting their time and possibly destroying their future in the hope that Muslims will see the light? Though I believe many Europeans have good intentions, they are doing nothing but hurting themselves. For people who claim to be culturally tolerant, it always shocks me that people assume that non-Europeans will get rid of their heathen ways and adopt their culture of tolerance and logic. It still has overtones of cultural bias, though they would never admit it (though they won&rsquo;t admit it is natural either).  Now, at one point we Europeans were heavily religious, but through time religion evolved in Europe and a balance of religion and secular power produced the tolerant society many Europeans enjoy today. Islam never went through this.  Some immigrants can be assimilated to where they are tolerable and able to at the least function in a Western society, but for Muslim immigrants it just seems like a lost cause.  <br>
What I find most ironic is that many Europeans hate the idea of racial fascism, yet they are sowing the seeds for just that. They will push Europeans into a corner and give them no choice but a violent one. <br>

		<p>Also in the news, Nicolai Sennels, a.k.a. &#8220;Captain Obvious&#8221; has announced that staring at that funny yellow thing in the sky will hurt your eyes.</p>
<p>The really appalling aspect to this story is that not only did it take this long for anyone in any sort of official capacity to admit that Muslims constitute an unassimilable criminal element in Western society, but that Sennels will (a) have this sound advice disregarded, (b) be prosecuted for saying this, (c) be faced with professional censure, or (d) some combination of any or all of the above.</p>

		<p>The author of this article is completely correct.  I have had a lot of experience with Muslims of all types, from professionals/academicians, to uneducated illegal immigrants. I have attended sessions in Mosques and Eid festivals.  So, I know Muslims.</p>
<p>Here is the main problem.  Islam is a primitive, strict, controlling, unforgiving, all-consuming religion, and in fact, it is a way of life.  It controls your every action and thought, and even the way you dress.  You must pray 5 times a day.  Non Muslims are infidels and must be converted.  Failing that, they must be killed.  Islam is TOTALLY incomparable with a modern secular society. </p>
<p>Nearly all the Islamic scientists and physicians that I have known were frauds.  They did not care about the science or about helping people.  They were in it for the money and prestige. Their data cannot be trusted.  I would never go to a Islamic physician   &mdash;   they simply do not care.  Again, they are in it for the money, and patients are simply a big bother, and need to be billed and dispatched with as quickly as possible.  They are highly nepotistic.  There is no value in importing millions into our homelands.  Why are our governments doing so?    </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you need &#8220;Phd&#8221; in anything to figure out, that<br>
moslems and Western Civilization are incompatible. Just look around you, they still dress like 7th century throwbacks, so why <br>
would anybody expect them to act any different. Too bad, Europeans are realising this about 25 years too late&hellip;All you need, is a little bit of common sense..</p>

		<p>I agree that most of these Muslim thugs need to be sent back to their country of origin. I wonder what the Danish Peoples Party is doing to try to limit Muslim immigration. Let&rsquo;s face it, the reason why the Muslims are in Denmark is to take advantage of the country&rsquo;s social welfare programs.</p>

<p>WRONG! WRONG! their and our politicians understand full well what the muslims are up to, there and in the U.S. they just don&rsquo;t care as long as they are kept in power. &#8220;professionall politicians&#8221; don&rsquo;t care is the spend dollars, dinars, pesos or rubles as long as they are the ones spending. There, as in the U.S. any politician that keeps voting for freebies for the illegals, muslims and criminal blacks is going to retain that voting base&hellip;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they are Muslim, black, mexican, asian or whatever, they can never be assimilated into a White nation or society. Many try to say that LEGAL 3rd world immigrants do assimilate, which is a joke. NO, they never will. WE are different races with different thinking patterns and different ways of life that can never unify as ONE! It has never happened and never will happen. We are fools if we continue to buy into their propaganda. </p>

<p>That forbidden word was not mentioned anywhere in this entire article!</p>
<p>Behavior is not entirely a matter of culture (as the Marxists would choose to explain it).  Dr. Sennels is on the right path, but he&rsquo;s got a long way yet to go.</p>

		<p>What a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand can be confined to this single statement:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
When it comes to identity among Muslims, nationality does not count at all in comparison with culture and religion. The consequence is a powerful and growing opposition to Western culture and values in Muslim ghettoes throughout Copenhagen and other major European cities.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>To a Muslim (as to the regional precursor peoples going back to Alexander) TRIBE IS NATION.  And failure to make that correct interpretation is a direct result of -our- legacy inheritance from a millenia of manorial feudalism because &#8216;Nascere&rsquo; means _by birth_, not by land.  We come from peasant serfs.  Not them.</p>
<p>Once you understand this it becomes easy to envision a life without major resources, material or agricultural and thus without reward for sharing amongst an expanded identity base.  A life where you had to TAKE what you wanted and the sheer guff to do so as a high testosterone attitude based on honor and vendetta most likely (by now) has permanently shaped the evolutionary brain development of the entirety of SWA.</p>
<p>Myself before my brother, we brothers before our cousins, our cousins before the tribe, the tribe before state.  And all before Islam.</p>
<p>Islam did not change these peoples exploited, exploitative, natures, it _harnessed_ them by explicitly forbidding them any other lifestyle choice and rewarding them with breeding rights and loot for becoming part of a robber gang.</p>
<p>Said gang takes tribute from one area, denuding it of females on a 4:1 basis of reward to warrior males.  Then it recruits on the basis of pillage as genetic persistence rights in the next area over and so on and so forth.  Growing as it expands.  Because if you want anything from Islam, you must convert.</p>
<p>Before the Renaissance, Islam was the most successful, expansive, culture on the planet.</p>
<p>Finding those they cannot convert or kill outright, Islamically trained young toughs today are at a complete loss for how to interact on a cop:boss:landlord level of graduated hierarchies above them because respect and dominance is their WHOLE (rote) acquired culture.</p>
<p>A system of warrior privilege that cannot live but that it grows through conquest.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s most despicable about this is that the Muslims know it QUITE WELL themselves, choosing to conceal it behind a facade of &#8216;Taqqiya&rsquo; or tactical disinformation.</p>
<p>Indeed, back in 2005, shortly after the Beslan tragedy, the brother in law of the owner of Al Jazeera, himself the owner of a very influential newspaper in Kuwait, wrote a personal editorial that basically said:  &#8220;Look you idiots, the whole world thinks Islam is a terrorist religion because 9 out of 10 terrorist acts in the last 10 years have been by or included Islamic indoctrinated youth.  You had better get your young men under control or we will be the pariahs of the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>And nobody listened to him.  Because he wasn&rsquo;t telling a shocking unknown.</p>
<p>What _The West_ refuses to acknowledge is that Islam is a majority fundamentalist religion (which is to say natively extremist), of which the high-IQ, college bound, &#8216;Ivy League sweater wearers&rsquo; of the upper class moderates (that Islamic and particularly Iranian TV occasionally parades before the camera) are entirely non-representative.  Anymore than the Kennedy&rsquo;s are accurate reflections of our culture.</p>
<p>Which is why this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
We actually have the economic means to do this. As I mentioned previously, the Danish National Bank calculated, that every immigrant from Muslim countries costs 300,000 euros on average. With this money, we could help these people to live a happy life in a Muslim country without having to integrate in a society they don&rsquo;t understand and therefore cannot accept. Having money enough to support one&rsquo;s family and live in a country where one feels at home with the surrounding culture would be a great step forward in the quality of their lives. And we should help them achieve this.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Will never work.  Should never be -attempted-.  Since such Jizzya (legal extortion from non-believers) payments only reinvigorate the belief that strength deserves to dominate weakness _as the system_ or &#8216;racket&rsquo; by which Islam functions as a warrior cult built upon conquest.</p>
<p>If you want them out.  Kick them posteriorly.  Do not play head games with these people.  There is nothing there to be shrunk.</p>
<p>Only in the utter, abject, failure of their grand religion to be accepted by -anyone- in the West will the followers of Mohammed find something to think about beyond their own misery.</p>
<p>Some interesting quotes about how Islam works, why it&rsquo;s imbedded so deep and what the control vectors are-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Gabriel questions the patriotism of Muslim Americans and portrays Islam as an evil and destructive force. &#8220;America and the West are doomed to failure in this war [on terror] unless they stand up and identify the real enemy: Islam. &hellip; If you want to understand the nature of the enemy we face, visualize a tapestry of snakes. They slither and they hiss, and they would eat each other alive, but they will unite in a hideous mass to achieve their common goal of imposing Islam on the world. This is the ugly face of the enemy we are fighting,&#8221; she famously said at the 2006 Intelligence Summit. <br>

For two years I&rsquo;ve been researching a book about Alexander the Great&rsquo;s counter-guerrilla campaign in Afghanistan, 330-327 B.C. What struck me most powerfully is that that war is a dead ringer for the ones we&rsquo;re fighting today – even though Alexander was pre-Christian and his enemies were pre-Islamic. <br>
The heart of every tribal male is that of a warrior. Even the most wretched youth in a Palestinian refugee camp sees himself as a knight of Islam. The Pathan code of nangwali prescribes three virtues – nang, pride; badal, revenge; melmastia, hospitality. These guys are Apaches. <br>
What the warrior craves before all else is respect. Respect from his own people, and, even more, from his enemy. When we of the West understand this, as Alexander did, we&rsquo;ll have taken the first step toward solving the unsolvable. <br>

Islam is a revealed religion with a distinct set of unchanging rules and guidelines to follow. It is not a religion that is supposed to &#8220;come from within&#8221; like some new age religion. It seems quite incongruous to claim that one believes that Muhammad was Allah&rsquo;s prophet and therefore profess to be a Muslim and then reject clear Islamic doctrine as established by Muhammad when the Qur&rsquo;an demands that Muslims obey Muhammad and follow his &#8220;perfect&#8221; example. The religion is named Islam, meaning submission, because its founder, Muhammad, claimed that is the word Allah said to him in several alleged revelations. (Fn 1) Otherwise, the religion would surely have been known as Muhammadanism or something similar thereto. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
What Went Right Set The Stage For Decline</p>
<p>Understanding what went wrong in the Islamic world is, perhaps, best addressed by first recognizing what went right because the initial success of Islam and its early rise to economic, political, and military power is also a primary cause of what ultimately went wrong. </p>
<p>When Muhammad and his early followers arrived in Medina, it is clear that they were in a less than secure economic state. They had cut themselves off from the protection and support of their tribe - an act that was considered tantamount to a death sentence at the time. Moreover, this severance from their tribe&rsquo;s support and protection occurred in a hostile environment. The Arabian Peninsula consists mainly of desert that, under normal circumstances, can only support a low-density population. Whether Muhammad felt that he had no other alternatives or whether he felt he had other options is something we will probably never know with certainty, but there is no question that Muhammad chose to create a society that sustained itself and advanced its interests by preying upon non-Muslims. </p>
<p>Mohammed said: &#8220;I have been ordered to fight with the people till they say, None has the right to be worshiped but Allah, and whoever says, None has the right to be worshiped but Allah, his life and property will be saved by me.&#8221; (Fn 3) &#8220;Allah made the Jews leave their homes by terrorizing them so that you killed some and made many captives. And He made you inherit their lands, their homes, and their wealth&hellip; .&#8221; (Fn 4) Clearly, Muhammad viewed non-Muslim&rsquo;s land and property as fair game and his conduct established that he practiced what he preached. </p>
<p>Instead, we see Ahmadiyya Muslims, many Sufi Muslims, and Bahai Muslims all believing they are &#8220;Muslims&#8221; when they have deviated so far from the religion Muhammad preached and practiced that Muhammad would hardly consider them Muslims. Muhammad once ordered a mosque, whose members were practicing a heretical form of Islam, burned and his followers burned it to the ground with the heretical Muslims inside thereby establishing in Islamic doctrine that schisms were not only not to be tolerated, but should be violently suppressed. (Fn 2) <br>

<p>&gt;<br>
One important answer to the question lies in an ingenious social invention arising among the early Muslims. This was a breeding system that motivated successful warriors with a great incentive to spread their faith and their culture. Bloom puts this motivation in stark terms as &ldquo;the restless effort of human males to find more wombs to carry their seed.&rdquo;[1] Islam has the remarkable advantage of being highly patriarchal and polygamous with great sexual benefits for those warriors able to conquer in its name; Islam was and remains a great male racket. Furthermore, these advantages are not the temporary kind that have always been associated with warfare, but continue to exist within the peacetime new order.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Warriors were not the only Muslim males sexually rewarded for advancing Islam. As seen above, Islam was also spread by trade and mercantile activity. The wealth accumulated by a successful merchant could be considerable. Thus, those responsible for promoting Islam beyond the borders of the Dar-al-Islam could also obtain the means of purchasing concubines and of affording multiple wives.<br>

		<p>&#8220;In his book, Nicolai Sennels shares a psychological perspective of this Muslim Culture, its relationship to anger, handling emotions and its religion. He based his research on hundreds of hours of therapy with 150 young Muslims in the Copenhagen youth jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this psychologist is drawing conclusions about GENERAL Muslim psychology based on a study consisting exclusively of JAILED CRIMINALS who happen to be Muslim. And commenters do not see an unrepresentative sample here that even a high school student would recognize?</p>
<p>Anyone who believes that his conclusions could possibly apply to non-criminal Muslims is either delusional or intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>True! he should have mentioned that most all of the muslims invading EU are black African muslims or Pakistani/Bangledeshi muslims. Also, I believe that serious violence would already have broken out in the U.S. if not for marriages, because a man with a wife and family is loathe to risk their well being, however! a man with nothing to loose can become very dangerous, especially a White man. Any attempt to throw the muslims out of EU or America is for sure to result in violence, NOT RIOTS, serious, murderous ambushing, premeditated, final solution type of violence against muslims, blacks and treacherous politicians.</p>

		<p>   I must say that in their own Middle Eastern countries Muslims are quite law-abiding. They have difficulty adapting to free and open European societies because the level of authority is different. For devote Muslims, Islam controls all aspects of their lives, European secular humanism seems both hostile and incompatible with their beliefs. Can Muslims assimilate? Perhaps, they can in limited numbers, but not as part of huge family migrations. One must also be aware that not all Muslims are alike with some Lebanese, Syrian, Turkish and Sufi Muslims being more cosmopolitan and urbane and less likely to follow fundamentalism. </p>

		<p>Very nice to see this from the perspective of a leading Danish psychologist. We need to work harder to argue our positions citing leading intellectuals from traditionally Liberal/Left places like academia.</p>
<p>This is why it is so important to make radical Islam the main propaganda enemy. We can argue the truth that Muslim male immigrants will not accept Western liberal ideas about &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, live and let live etc.</p>
<p>When powerful Liberal/Left Whites in the West come around, things will break our way.</p>

A life where you had to TAKE what you wanted and the sheer guff to do so as a high testosterone attitude based on honor and vendetta most likely (by now) has permanently shaped the evolutionary brain development of the entirety of SWA&hellip;<br>
The heart of every tribal male is that of a warrior.</i></p>
<p>Which brings up an interesting point: are Muslims in the main a different &#8220;breed&#8221; (for a lack of a better word)? Has centuries of their mating patterns produced a different sort of human being? Is the difference between Muslim and Westerner not simply one of religious or cultural outlook, but of a completely different &#8220;wiring&#8221; of the brain and hormonal systems? </p>
<p>The British in the 19th century believed there were certain martial races, such as the Pathans, who made better soldiers. This is pooh-poohed by today&rsquo;s PC anthropology, but perhaps the British were more willing to face reality in those great days. </p>
<p>Much of the Islamic conquests were executed by peoples who were essentially nomadic in character: Arabs, Berbers, Turks, etc. And one might ask if other peoples who joined in were also of the nomadic type, including the not too infrequent Christian renegade. Thus, Islam becomes the ideological expression of nomadic conquerors. Are we seeing today a new phase of the struggle of the nomads against the city dwellers in the tradition of the Scythians, Huns, Mongols, Turks, etc? And now played out in the streets of Europe?</p>
<p><i>Currently 70% of the prison population in the Copenhagen youth prison consists of young man of Muslim heritage.</i></p>
<p>Must be interesting for Europeans in their formerly low crime (or at least low street crime) societies to suddenly find themselves faced with this level of violators.  Is there any move to rescind their gun control laws to allow people to defend themselves? Or is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>I wonder if Europeans will be moving to more hardcore law-and-order policies? The US has done so over the last several decades, at much cost in civil liberties and well as civil society. </p>
<p><i>I must say that in their own Middle Eastern countries Muslims are quite law-abiding.<br>
</i></p>
<p>Perhaps because of their governments&rsquo; repressive measures against crime? Or is it that there is a political dimension to Muslim crime in Europe? It&rsquo;s a thinly disguised form of guerrilla warfare against the cultural enemy. Consider the political dimension to crime in the rainbow nation of South Africa, where farm attacks are a means to terrorize White people. </p>
<p>Stay tuned. </p>

		<p>18 Anonymous: Ordinarily, prisoners are a non-representative sampling of a society.  But when a minority manages to become 70% of the prison inmates, other factors must be at work.  Criminals, who are a very small fraction of the Danish population, are a much larger proportion of the Moslem population, and are therefore much more representative of their culture.  In fact, as with Blacks in the U.S., excluding criminals from the sample will significantly distort the findings.  In violent cultures, thugs are not the fringe, but the ideal.  </p>

		<p>My only and last social dealing with a Muslim was a guy my uncle did business with - I would give my elderly uncle rides to his business. At first him and his family were pleasant to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a woman and over time they found out about my life - I had a somewhat high powered career (since retired on a pension), didn&rsquo;t marry or have children - my career was too demanding. Their female older children were very interested in what I used to do for a living and always asked me lots of questions.</p>
<p>Even though he has been in this country for decades, they still live as strict Muslims - arranged his daughter&rsquo;s marriage to another Muslim as soon as she turned 18 (and she was pregnant within a week of her marriage-another means of control), keep exclusively to themselves (unless you do business with them), very pro-male and let it be known in their view a woman&rsquo;s place was in the home, not earning a living or having a career.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer but over time his courteous demeanor towards me changed to one of amused disgust, which my uncle could not or chose not to see. As soon as that happened I told my uncle he would have to find some other way to get there. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had strong reservations about Middle Eastern people and their religion and have chose to avoid them. This experience just proved to me what I and an enlightened world should realize; they do not think like us nor do they have any respect for woman. To them, woman are just cattle to use for breeding and home labor, so anyone who thinks they come into a country and &#8220;assimilate&#8221; are crazy. Oh, Muslims couldn&rsquo;t be nicer if they are making money off of you, but at the core of their being they hate Western civilization and its people. </p>

<p>Islam is a very tenacious and resistent cult that, once established,  is not easy to conquer or replace. I can&rsquo;t really think of any place where this has happened, except Spain, and that was against tremendous resistance, accomplished only by  sheer force of arms.

<p>  Good point, Islam is a strongly patriarchal religion. The husband has complete authority over the women in the family. This is not only cultural but based in the Holy Koran and the Hadith. liberal European and American women, who think Western culture won&rsquo;t change by the presence of large numbers of ultra conservative Muslim immigrants, are in for a huge, unpleasant shock.   </p>

<p>&#8220;Ordinarily, prisoners are a non-representative sampling of a society. But when a minority manages to become 70% of the prison inmates, other factors must be at work. Criminals, who are a very small fraction of the Danish population, are a much larger proportion of the Moslem population, and are therefore much more representative of their culture&#8221;</p>
<p>You are confusing the fraction of prisoners who are Muslims and the fraction of Muslims who are prisoners. 70% of prisoners may be Muslims, but what % of the total Danish Muslim population are prisoners? </p>
<p>In Denmark, the 2007 prison population was 4198. 70% of that is 2939.</p>

<p>The total 2007 population of Denmark is 5451826.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/denmark/population-of-denmark.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mapsofworld.com/denmark/population-of-denmark.html</a></p>
<p>Muslims are 4% of Denmark&rsquo;s total population of roughly 5.5. million, ie. 218073.</p>
<p>2939/218073 = 0.0134</p>
<p>You want me to believe that 1.34% of Muslims represent Muslim culture? I am not that gullible, and I sincerely hope neither are most people.</p>

<p>Of course, crime is just the most extreme form of the Moslem mismatch with European civilization.  The Moslems also excel in sloth, dishonesty, domestic violence, rudeness, ingratitude, ignorance, and every other vice that can be measured by the records of health, education, and welfare departments in every country in Europe.  A crime rate 56X that of the host population does not just appear without cause.</p>

 According to your misleading statistics 1.34% of Denmark&rsquo;s muslim population are in jail.<br>
 What you don&rsquo;t state is that prisoners are primarily male and younger than age 40, but older than 18.<br>
 When you compare the proprtion of muslim prisoners to the proportion of the muslim population likely ti offend, you&rsquo;ll get a much different and frightening figure, which must be in the order of around 5% or 1 in 20 muslims, who *at any one time* are in jail.Those on probation or forner inmates not being counted.<br>
  Even better is to compare ethnic Danish criminakity per head with muslim criminality per head.</p>

		<p>RE 28&hellip;If the US followed this policy, the Afghan war would be over by now. Instead we have three cups of tea with them&hellip;<br>
And that is the real issue. Even though many of us have had to adjust to Muslims in our midst, either in reality or in the media, the question of what we are going to do militarily is the only thing that counts in the end.<br>
A thinker named Michael Scheuer said in so many words that the American people have been repeatedly lied to; that we don&rsquo;t know the extent of the adulation OBL and his ilk have in the Islamic world, nor their competence, and we don&rsquo;t factor in the reality of the numbers of them we have to fight and DEFEAT to survive.<br>
We are not adequately prepared to win; not psychologically anyway. I don&rsquo;t see a victory in sight when Michael Bloomberg types get the backing of the law and the media. Can anyone imagine a war effort the size of WW2 today? No? That is because nations serious about winning wars do not willingly import millions of fifth columnists; usually they don&rsquo;t even give the enemy much time to explain their side of the argument. It takes years to build up the tenacity necessary to win a protracted war; you can&rsquo;t get it on the cheap through spectacle i.e., &#8220;shock and awe&#8221;. The effect wears off.<br>
Personally I think something Scheuer said - and was condemned for saying so - was that the catalyst necessary to get the USA fighting was a massive terror attack and nothing less, was true.<br>
I hate to say this but I am not counting on us to win any kind of long term conflict anymore. The fight&rsquo;s out of the dog.</p>

<p>First of all, your distinction between between &#8220;Danes&#8221; and &#8220;Muslims living in Denmark&#8221; is flawed. It would be more accurate to compare &#8220;non-Muslims in Denmark&#8221; and &#8220;Muslims in Denmark&#8221;. </p>
<p>With that said, the attitude you demonstrate by your choice of labels (ie. that Muslims are not to be considered Danish) is shared, consciously or subconsciously, by a significant fraction of society, and encouraged by the mainstream media as well as websites like this one. This attitude, implicitly converted into social (including police and judiciary) bias, could account for much of the disparity in incarceration rates. In short, the problem is people like you who prefer to emphasize what separates Muslims from non-Muslims rather than emphasize what unites us.</p>

Since citizenship is passed out so freely, it has become nothing but a legal fiction, meaningless outside of the government benefits it gets you.  <br>
     The idea that these Moslems have a crime rate 56X that of Danes because people like me don&rsquo;t consider them to be real Danes is unlikely. <br>
1.  I, personally, don&rsquo;t live in Denmark, so my views have no bearing on the actions of those people,  <br>
2. Moslems in Denmark do not read this website, unless they are fluent in English, very unlikely for Third-World tenants of Danish jails.  <br>
3.  The mainstream media does NOT criticize non-White immigration, period.  Where have you seen the mainstream media question the place of Hindus or Moslems or Nigerians as real Americans?  What newspaper?  What TV network?  I&rsquo;ve been around more of these people that I care to, and they are convinced of their right to come here and collect goodies, and all of their family too. <br>
4. The psychologist interviewed here, Nicholas Sennels, has been threatened by the Danish courts with the loss of his job for expressing his negative opinions on Moslem immigration.  Exactly how does this add up to a social bias that would cause the Moslems to commit crimes 56X as often per capita than Danes?  </p>
<p>If the problem of Moslem criminality is caused by people like me, how wretchedly high strung these foreigners must be.  Anything less than a public welcome by 100% of the host nation, and they turn feral.  Maybe that&rsquo;s just one of the differences between Moslems and us.  <br>
     And why are advocates of &#8220;diversity&#8221; so uncomfortable about acknowledging the differences between cultures?  If cultures are not different, how can there be such a thing as multi-culturalism?  </p>
<p>As for Europeans who become Moslems, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re mentally unstable, just like the Hare Krishnas in America.  </p>

               It is NOT irrelevant that in all societies criminals are predominately young men.The point I was trying to make (and you are trying to mendaciously obfuscate through misleading arguments and statistics), is that you, deliberately and mendaciously divided the total of muslim prisoners by muslims of ALL AGES to give a throughly misleading and absurd low representation, purporting to show that muslims aren&rsquo;t particularly criminal.<br>
 As I repeat, since criminality is a young man&rsquo;s game, a better representation of muslim criminality is given by the proportion of the young male population - the people who are actually dangerous who are incarcerated.And that proportion is frighteningly big.</p>

              No matter how much you try to lie, spin, wriggle, obfuscate, twist and turn, the brute fact remains that 70% of Danish criminals in this study are muslims and this represents an absolutely shocking 56-fold (or 5600% if you will) over-representation in criminality.<br>
 This statistic is just so horrible and so shocking that I just cannot understand how it is acceptable to anyone of rational mind - no matter how bigoted with &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; propaganda they are.<br>

I rest my case.&#8221;  You&rsquo;re not my professor, this is a comment section on a website.  </p>
<p>And to remind you, how can the Danes be the problem in their own homeland?  Or are you conceding the point?  </p>
<p>And do you really think that police bias can be the cause of Moslems having a crime rate 56X that of Danes?  Especially when the law threatens a psychologist for questioning immigration?  Where is the bias?  </p>

<p>&#8220;70% of Danish criminals in this study are muslims&#8221;<br>
&#8220;This statistic is just so horrible and so shocking&#8221;</p>
<p>90% of criminals are men. Is this statistic not even more horrible and shocking? So should women have countries of their own and allow no male immigrants? This is how ridiculous it sounds when you attempt to link crime statistics to immigration policy.</p>
<p>%57:</p>
<p>&#8220;Moslem culture overlaps with Iranian culture, or Turkish culture, or Egyptian culture, but it does not overlap with Danish culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>It overlaps with Danish culture as soon as there are Danish Muslims, which there are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you suggest that Islam overlaps with Japanese culture?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Does Buddism overlap with Moroccan culture?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. There are Japanese Muslims and Morrocan Buddhists.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about with regards to 90% of Indonesians. Enlighten me, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have converted to Islam, but they do not consider themselves to be any less Indonesian, even though Indonesia was formerly non-Islamic. I would like to see you attempt to convince them that they are not culturally Indonesian.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an author, as the one you linked to, tells me that doubting the wisdom of immigration is evidence of neurosis, I don&rsquo;t need to read further, since I deny his premises.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the article does not depend on these premises to reach its conclusions, so denial of the premises is not a valid reason for dismissing its conclusions, which are primarily drawn from statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to remind you, how can the Danes be the problem in their own homeland?&#8221;</p>
<p>How can&rsquo;t they be? In fact, people are most likely to behave unfairly from a position of power, such as when they are the majority and/or dominant politically and economically.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you really think that police bias can be the cause of Moslems having a crime rate 56X that of Danes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. Muslim immigrants are what is known as a visible minority. Visible minorities draw disproportionate attention, subconsciously as well as consciously. If you have nine black ants and one red ant crawling around in a box, it will be almost effortless for you to follow the trail of the red ant, but quite taxing for you to keep up with the trails of the black ants. The same principle applies to crime investigations. When a visible minority does anything, people notice/remember when they would ignore/forget if someone else did it. Combined with the post-9/11 media hysteria that brainwashed people into equating Muslims with terrorists, I would be surprised if the statistics WEREN&rsquo;T what they are.</p>

		<p>Now our resident genius pontificates that 90% of criminals are men.<br>
 This is the same commentator who kept on insisting on the fact that young males form the majority of criminals is, in his words, &#8216;irrelevant&rsquo;.<br>
 No one here should give this commentator any respect - he doesn&rsquo;t deserve any.</p>

		<p>The point I&rsquo;m trying to get across to Amrenners (and even into the demented mind of a certain poster on this topic), is that moslem immigrants into Denmark ARE SIMPLY NOT DANES.<br>
 They are recent, alien interlopers - genetically distinct have have squatted on Danish soil for a mere 30 years at most, compared to ethnic Danes - who share a genetic heritage and have resided on the Danish peninsula and islands for countless millenia.<br>
 Not only are they cultural, reliously and genetically alien (the Danes owe them nothing, least of all solidarity), they appear to be rather nasty and unpleasant people with it, who on the basis of hard factual evidence seem intent on destroying Denmark.</p>

		<p>58 Anonymous: Moslem culture does not overlap with Danish culture just because Moslems happen to be present in Denmark.  Does the presence of a Nazi Storm Trooper in a synagogue represent the overlap of Nazi and Jewish culture?  What if the Nazi smiles?  The same applies to Moslems in Japan or Buddhists in Morrocco.  You have mistaken an infection for healthy growth.  </p>
<p>Before Indonesia was Moslem, it was not the same culture as today.  They may call themselves by the same name, but they are not the same, and I doubt that any Indonesian would deny that.  The people there are culturally &#8220;post-Mohammed&#8221;, whereas they once were &#8220;pre-Mohammed&#8221;.  (Buddhist?  Hindu?  Animist?)  If Europe were to universally adopt Islam, it too would be a different culture than today.  We wish to avoid that.  </p>
<p>My disinclination to read your assignments is no argument for your position.  There are only 24 hours in a day.  I don&rsquo;t have the time to read articles to determine whether or not the author ignores his own premises.  If the premises are bad, I&rsquo;ll find something else to read.  If you want to make a point, do your own arguing.<br>
     BTW, have you yet read Willoughby and Cavanaugh?  No?  Then you couldn&rsquo;t possibly know what you&rsquo;re talking about. </p>
<p>If Danes are a problem in their own country, are Arabs a problem in Saudi Arabia?  If so, what ought to be done about those troublesome people?</p>
<p>If the measured crime rate of Moslems in Denmark is a consequence of police bias, then for every Moslem convict there must be 55 Danish criminals running free.  Where are all the bodies?</p>
<p>I give you credit for consistency, but ideology coupled to ignorance produces some astonishing results.  Judeao-Nazi culture.  Conclusions without premises.  Native peoples are the problem, not the newcomers.  And the invisible crimes of the Danes. <br>

		<p><b>It overlaps with Danish culture as soon as there are Danish Muslims, which there are.</b></p>
<p>There are no genuinely &#8220;Danish&#8221; Moslems, except for those ethnic Danes who have converted to Islam. But in doing so, they have essentially abandoned their people&rsquo;s culture and taken on another one. Islam is much more than a religion; it is a way of life and a culture in itself (which is essentially that of the Arabian peninsula - the customs, the dress, the food, the habits). Thus, I would say that you cannot follow Danish culture and that of Islam too. It&rsquo;s either /or.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;Would you suggest that Islam overlaps with Japanese culture?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Does Buddism overlap with Moroccan culture?&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
Yes. There are Japanese Muslims and Morrocan Buddhists.</b></p>
<p>Well, I have spent some time in Morocco, several times, and do know a little about it. I don&rsquo;t know if there are any Moroccan Buddhists or not. I haven&rsquo;t seen any and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine,  but certainly they would be very strange anomalies there, cultural freaks, and disapproved by the rest of the populace (to say the very least). Westerners might be Bu8ddhists or anything else and get away with it   &mdash;   because Westerners are expected to be rather strange. But this cultural defection would not be tolerated from a fellow Moroccan. At the least, I think his life would be made very difficult and he would be seen as a traitor to his culture.  (Which, in fact, he is.)</p>
<p>But then, you have to ask: is Budhissm a whole way of life, as Islam is?  Or is it just a few prayers and devotions, and then he can go on with his regular Islamic customs (food, dress, morality, etc.)?</p>

&#8220;Before Indonesia was Moslem, it was not the same culture as it is today. They may call themselves by the same name, but they are not the same, and I doubt that any Indonesian would deny that.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>That is absolutely true!  In the same way, Turkey is not the same culture that it was when it was Anatolia or Byzantium, And Islamic Egypt is not the same culture that it was pre-Islam.</p>
<p>Islam is a total way of life, and it brings a total change to any place  that it conquers. The same expectation could be applied to Denmark. It may remain the same piece of geography, but nothing more.  The resemblance would end there.  It would be a new culture. (And not a better one.)  </p>
<p>And I might add that it would also -  inevitably - bring a new people as well.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve pointed out before, Scandinavia has NEVER been invaded by outsiders.  This would be a FIRST in history!  And, given their tiny numbers, it would be the end of Scandinavians.</p>
