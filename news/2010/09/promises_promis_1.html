<h1>Promises, Promises: Few Black Coast Guard Cadets</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis Conrad, Google News, September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At his inaugural parade a half-century ago, President John F. Kennedy watched the U.S. Coast Guard Academy&rsquo;s marching unit pass him on Pennsylvania Avenue and declared it unacceptable. Not one cadet was black, he told an aide, and something ought be done about it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cover of the academy&rsquo;s 2010 cadet handbook comes close to summing up the situation. There are 14 faces, with a single black one barely visible and off to the side and behind a white cadet.</p>
<p>In a year when the academy proclaims the Class of 2014 as its most diverse ever, the share of blacks enrolled is even more modest than the picture would suggest. Only nine of the 289 students sworn in last June identified themselves as blacks or African-Americans  &mdash;  or 15 when mixed-race blacks are included. By mid-August, the total had dropped to 14 after one cadet withdrew.</p>
<p>The problem is so vexing  &mdash;  and so long-standing  &mdash;  that the Coast Guard last year spent $40,000 buying lists of names of blacks and others to recruit as cadets. It didn&rsquo;t pay off, {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An internal task force report at the academy described negative perceptions of blacks and recounted racist remarks by faculty. Just a few years ago, in 2007, a black cadet and an officer conducting race relations training found nooses left for them. A major investigation was inconclusive.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no affirmative action but people think you are there on affirmative action,&#8221; said Lt. j.g. DeCarol Davis, who became the first black woman to be top of her class at the academy when she was the 2008 valedictorian as an engineering major. &#8220;It did persist throughout my tenure at the academy. I was even told I got where I was because I was the token black girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s figures are still an improvement over the five blacks who enrolled last year and represented only 2 percent of the Class of 2013. But twice in past years there were 22 blacks, in 1974 and again in 1999. As recently as the Class of 2010, there were as many as 13 blacks.</p>
<p>The latest figure is so small the academy shifts the focus to how its latest class is one-fourth composed of underrepresented minorities, including blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Blacks make up 12.9 percent of the U.S. population  &mdash;  or 13.6 percent when including mixed-race blacks  &mdash;  according to census figures. That would translate into an academy class size of more than 40 cadets and raise overall black enrollment close to 130 students, about 100 more than the past year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to current and former black Coast Guard cadets, recruiters and admissions officials:</p>
<p>* The black community doesn&rsquo;t know much about the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>* Unlike at service academies for the Army, Navy and Air Force, there aren&rsquo;t legacy generations of black graduates to steer their children toward Coast Guard service. Among the academies, the Naval Academy has the best record on recruiting blacks, who now make up more than 10 percent of its cadet classes.</p>
<p>* The Coast Guard is competing with public and private universities offering full-ride scholarships for the same black students with high science and math scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under pressure from lawmakers, the academy last year spent $40,000 to buy lists of names of blacks and others from the National Research Center for College University Admissions, but the effort resulted only in 15 blacks or mixed-race blacks in the cadet class. The Coast Guard emphasized its numbers of overall minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results were astounding,&#8221; said Capt. Stephan Finton, the academy&rsquo;s admissions director. &#8220;When you go from 16 percent diversity of our entering class last year to 24 percent this year, I would say that we were pretty laser-focused and we really did get the results we were looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congress is restless for improvements. Under a provision passed in the House last year, lawmakers would nominate candidates for the Coast Guard&rsquo;s academy the same way that all the other service academies have operated. {snip}</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really not hard to understand.  Blacks have IQs 15-20 points lower than whites and East Asians.  If the selections are made on the basis of merit (IQ) then 9 out of 289 is about right, if you can get them to apply.  The only way to &#8220;solve&#8221; this problem is racial quotas.  Otherwise, the &#8220;problem&#8221; will never go away.  P.S.  They&rsquo;re also afraid of the water.  </p>

		<p>With Coast Guard midshipmen like black rapist Webster Smith, The Coast Guard Academy has already lowered its standards.</p>
<p>The trouble is that many top brass cave in to pressure so they could get another star to wear, plus a few more years of active duty.</p>
<p>Since too many white guys under 21 are Obama supporters, it might help if they were made aware of stories like the Academy&rsquo;s push for diversity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have several thousand young white guys, denied an academy admission due to Affirmative Action, feel the sting of quotas.<br>
Unfortunately, that sting is usually the only thing that will wake them up to reality.</p>

		<p>The fact that they are still being lambasted after jumping from 16 percent to 24 percent minority in just one year shows one thing  &mdash;  -It&rsquo;s not how many minorities that is important. The key is how many of the <i>right</i> minorities that is important.</p>

		<p>In the USCG, there are no hide-behind jobs that blacks can get like supply or personnel.  THey would actually have to work and save lives, something none of them as a race are prepared to do.  Plus&hellip;it requires knowing how to swim.  In the Navy&hellip;ok some jobs require swimming but in the USCG, you&rsquo;re out in heavy WX on a cutter or something smaller.  The chances of actually being in the water are exponentially greater than if you&rsquo;re in the Navy.  Finally&hellip;2 words that sums up the black experience with water&hellip;Negative Floating&hellip;as a race they physically &#8220;float&#8221; just under the surface due to muscle density and structure.

		<p>This is why liberalism must ultimately fail. They can&rsquo;t be happy that there are at least some blacks in any organization. There must be exact, mathematical proportional representation of blacks in ALL organizations, and the only way to do that is to lower standards so far that the organization eventually collapses.</p>

		<p>Why are we to believe that the CG doesn&rsquo;t have an AA program?  The Pentagon denies that they use AA, but the Pentagon files amicus curiae on the side of AA with almost every AA lawsuit that winds its way through the Federal judiciary.</p>
<p>The answer is simple:  Swimming.  Especially in the CG, when the probability of a CG-man or -woman swimming in a rough-water ocean is near 100%, while non-swimming blacks in the Navy do have some &#8220;support&#8221; occupations available, i.e. pushing a mop, cooking, being a diversity coordinator/enforcer, etc.</p>
<p>As an aside, somehow, my main e-mail address got added into the e-mail sendout list for Allen West&rsquo;s Congressional campaign, and his most recent one advertised a scuba dive with West off the Florida coast.  So evidently, Allen West can scuba dive, but that&rsquo;s not the same as swimming.</p>

		<p>It is discouraging perhaps and even a &#8216;national scandal&rsquo; but what you don&rsquo;t hear about is how every other employer and every other university is also scrambling to get as many qualified blacks and non-whites on board as possible too. It&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;s going to blame another diversity recruiter. That might be racist.   </p>

<p>Do blacks have some unique talents, perspectives, and ideas that are vital to the Coast Guard?</p>
<p>Yet another non-problem in search of a solution.</p>

		<p>As a former Coastie I can say with certainty that the one fact not in the article is that blacks seem to have an extremely difficult time passing the basic swim test necessary to graduate Coast Guard boot camp.</p>
<p>When I went through the police academy twenty years ago, many blacks were washed out on the swim test required there and it was less stringent than the Coast Guard&rsquo;s test.  As a result, the academy in my state filled the pool with concrete and no longer requires a swim test.  And I live in a coastal state with tons of lakes and rivers.  Once again, standards were lowered to facilitate an increase in black graduation rates.</p>

		<p>This article illustrates how well trained whites have become. Blacks put no  pressure was put on the Feds to increase black enrolment (they have important goals). Yet the Feds are so obsessed with Diversity that they do it anyway. Why? Perhaps one nasty reason is that when a black is admitted to the coast guard academy, a white male is denied admission. Even if the black never graduates, the white male is denied the opportunity for a real career.</p>

		<p>I think the Coast Guard Academy is a Congressional appointment. Those Congressmen and women that are black are either not filling their legal number of appointments or are deliberately steering aspiring young blacks from joining the military? I feel this is probably so. All the service academies have a problem recruiting and having minorities graduate. Coast Guard is no exception. And it is not only recruiting. Graduating is difficult as well. Those military academies have rough standards and more than just study is required from a cadet.</p>

		<p>Beyond the water issue, there is also the Coast Guard Academy&rsquo;s training ship Eagle as a deterrent.  Eagle is a large sailing vessel, and cadets are expected to climb into the rigging, over 100 feet above the water, and man the sails while standing in footropes, holding on with one hand, and fighting heavy flapping wet canvas with the other.  </p>

		<p>Sorry guys, but swimming has nothing to do with it.  A lack of necessary mental competence in either I.Q. or ability is responsible for the failure rate, or the lack of representation.</p>
<p>Pressing the higher political brass to come up with a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear, just makes whores of any who succumb to the pressure to find qualified blacks where there are none.</p>
<p>Such a disgusting spectacle the US military has become.  </p>

<p>I can help with the investigation by pointing to the two prime suspects - the black cadet and the officer conducting race relations training.</p>
<p>Not saying they did it, just saying they&rsquo;re the most likely suspects; looking at the facts from other noose cases, virtually all of them have turned out to be hoaxes planted by the blacks themselves. In fact, I can&rsquo;t even recall the last noose incident that was actually a real case of a white person putting it there to intimidate blacks. (If a white liberal places a noose for the purpose of inciting a riot or advancing his political cause, it still counts as a hoax).</p>
<p>As for the black &#8220;valedictorian&#8221; cadet interviewed in the article, questions have to be asked - if the Coast Guard is willing to go so far as to spend tens of thousands of dollars buying lists of blacks to recruit as cadets, isn&rsquo;t it at the very least plausible that instructors are &#8220;strongly encouraged&#8221; to inflate the grades of black cadets?</p>
<p>Again, no accusations, only questions. Questions that, of course, the politically correct will find bothersome and offensive.</p>

<p>Anyway, who cares? I&rsquo;ve had it with these racial composition stories. Apparently, it is not about the Coast Guard any longer. It is now about filling The Obama Yacht Club with unqualified blacks and its new mission - to make low IQ recruits feel good about being on the water.</p>

		<p>These racial composition stories never are really fair, 14 out of 289 might sound bad, but it is still about 5 percent. This is about right considering that about half of black males drop out of high school and pretty much disqualify themselves from the labor pool except for informal work and jobs like barbering or whatnot. Out of those who do graduate, many wind up with  serious criminal records, further eliminating that from the potential pool of recruits. </p>
<p>Weeding out all those we are probably under the 5 percent figure already, however we have to then take into account the fact that even  many young black men simply refuse to work. I have to talk to tons of them at my job, and it is astounding how many of them well into their late twenties or even thirties or forties, simply have no shame about loafing around their beloved momma&rsquo;s house not working and not contributing a dime to the household expenses.</p>
<p>Joining the coast guard, a hard and rigorous job, would be absolutely unthinkable to these types, who at most would strive for a night watchman job or something like that where they can sit around a desk and watch tv for hours on end. At most I would estimate the pool of black applicants suitable for a dangerous and demanding Coast guard job would be somewhere in the range of 2-3 percent, however, this might be a drastic over estimate with that whole having to be able to swim problem.</p>

		<p>The Coast Guard is an elite service and the Academy is an outstanding institution. The son of a friend of ours turned down the Naval Academy for the Coast Guard Academy. He later taught there and has now attained a very high rank. What he accomplished he earned with his mental ability and decades of HARD WORK. </p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s unusual!  They need to get themselves a more up-to-date photographer.  Ordinarily, in shots such as that, the black face would be front and center, sharply focused, and the others arrayed around him, in the background, in faded focus. We&rsquo;ve all seen this in countless government and commercial ads. It&rsquo;s just standard procedure nowadays. Blacks always get the center position.</p>

		<p>Back in the early eighties I was seeking admission to either the Coast Guard Academy (CGA is just direct application, no congressional appointments FYI), Air Force Academy or Naval Academy.  During the process I learned of the Merchant Marine Academy when I received their catalog in the mail after my SAT scores were dispatched.   I was number seven in my graduating class.  Actually I should have been number 3, but we didn&rsquo;t have weighted classes.  If somebody took typing and got an A and I took Calculus or Physics and got a B, they would have higher class rank than me.  There were no blacks or minorities in any of my classes in a public high school in the deep South.  I took all advanced classes including Calculus, Physics, and Biology.  It was all white students in these classes.  At the time there was talk of eliminating these advanced classes because they were racist.</p>
<p>I was not admitted to the Air Force, Naval, or Coast Guard Academies.  Fortunately I did receive an appointment to the Merchant Marine Academy.  We did have one black admitted to the Air Force Academy and one Puerto Rican admitted to the Naval Academy.  I was dumbfounded when I found out because they were never in any of my classes.  The caveat was that they were both required to attend the &#8216;Naval Academy Prep School&rsquo; for one year prior to entry.  They were given special preference because of the color of their skin and because they were disadvantaged. But how were they disadvantaged?  They were both military brats like me.  We went to the same high school.  If they wanted to attend a federal academy why didn&rsquo;t they take Calculus and Physics in the first place?  At the time I was liberal and thought it was a good idea.  I believed that we whites needed to help those who were less capable than ourselves.  Now when I think about it I feel bitter.  </p>
<p>We had quite a collection of blacks and other minorities in my Freshman class at the Merchant Marine Academy, but most of them were gone by the end of Freshman and Sophomore years.  They didn&rsquo;t graduate, but they prevented entrance to more qualified whites who probably could have graduated.  Even as a liberal back then I saw the whole focus on diversity and minority enrollment as a complete fiasco.  Ultimately I believe only one black student graduated in my class.  Barely.  I knew him, and he was a good guy.  But his motto was &#8216;Two-owe (2.0) and go!&rsquo;.  And that&rsquo;s just what he did.  He knew he wasn&rsquo;t top-drawer material!</p>
