			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew G. Bostom, Pajamas Media, September 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A New York Post report from August 24 by Yoav Gonen highlighted the selective Islamophilia readily apparent in reading extracts from the New York State High School &#8220;Global History and Geography&#8221; Regents examinations. Subsequently, my colleague Gilbert Sewall of the American Textbook Council kindly provided me with the teachers Rating Guide for these Regents exam sections.</p>
<p>The egregious bias in this exam, and its structured, requisite evaluation by teachers, is transparent and disturbing. Two examples of complementary &#8220;Official Historical Documents&#8221; which students are required to read and discuss  &mdash;  one pertaining to Islamic Spain, the other Reconquista Christian Spain  &mdash;  along with very specific teacher evaluation guidelines they must satisfy for the best grade, epitomize the naked indoctrination being promoted.</p>
<p>Students are given a so-called &#8220;document&#8221; containing an extract from a textbook (Daniel Roselle&rsquo;s A World History: A Cultural Approach) which opens with this broad claim: &#8220;Wherever they went, the Moslems brought with them their love of art, beauty, and learning. From about the eighth to the eleventh century, their culture was superior in many ways to that of western Christendom.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are to be &#8220;evaluated,&#8221; exclusively, according to the guideline reproduced below:</p>
<p>&#8220;Award 1 credit (up to a maximum of 2 credits) for each different way Islam improved the lives of people in Spain according to Daniel Roselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Medieval Christian Spain was brutally conquered by waves of jihad wars (pp. 56-60) beginning in the early 8th century, involving massacre, pillage, deportation, and mass enslavement. This included harem slavery for non-Muslim women, and to guard these harems, eunuch slavery  &mdash;  the aptly termed &#8220;hideous trade&#8221; (pp. 92-93) production of human geldings from enslaved non-Muslim men.</p>
<p>But the approach is ultimately much more sinister: it is nothing less than Islamic proselytizing on the one hand, versus the inculcation of cynicism, if not contempt, for Christianity, and Western Christian civilization on the other.</p>
<p>Muslim &#8220;enlightened&#8221; rule of Spain in the Medieval era is contrasted starkly by the unmitigated, ghastly depredations wrought by the Spanish Christian imperialist conquerors and their religious minions in South America centuries later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once again, the students are to be &#8220;evaluated&#8221; on this basis alone, according to the guideline below which demands they regurgitate a purely destructive &#8220;narrative&#8221;: &#8220;Award 1 credit (up to a maximum of 2 credits) for each different change the friars introduced in Spanish America. Examples: destroying idols/temples; building permanent monasteries; constructing Christian buildings on sites of destroyed native temples; building temporary/permanent churches; holding services/fiestas in church buildings in a converted community; attempting to destroy paganism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} [Consider] the following historical account by S.L. Srivastava. He describes one of the pious Muslim jihadist Mahmud of Ghazni&rsquo;s (Ghazni being modern Afghanistan) nearly 20 bloody and devastating forays into India around present day Gujarat, during 1025 AD (p. 83): &#8220;Mahmud captured the place [Somanath] without much difficulty and ordered a general slaughter in which more than 50,000 persons are said to have perished. The idol of Somanath was broken into pieces which were sent to Ghazni, Mecca, and Medina and cast in streets and the staircases of chief mosques to be trodden by the Muslims going there for their prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding grave insult to irony, while New York State public secondary school students are being indoctrinated to &#8220;appreciate&#8221; the moral and cultural superiority of Islamic civilization, Muslim students within the New York City area are being taught the opposite regarding Jews and Christians at Islamic educational centers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;The book What Islam Is All About states that: &#8216;The Christians also worship statues. Many Jews and Christians,&rsquo; the book says, &#8220;lead such decadent and immoral lives that lying, alcohol, nudity, pornography, racism, foul language, premarital sex, homosexuality and everything else are accepted in their society, churches and synagogues.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The New York State Regents exams themselves now reflect the corrosive &#8220;success&#8221; of a sustained campaign of Islamophilic historical negationism. Cultural jihadism has achieved an ominous, and let us hope temporary victory, to the great detriment of New York City&rsquo;s secondary school children, their parents, and society at large.<br>

<p>Of course, one must forget where the term blueblood comes from and how Islam inspired that in Spain, following its expulsion from the continent.</p>
<p>Overall, what sickens me the most is watching this &ldquo;diversity perversity,&rdquo; a truly cancerous and intoxicatingly craved calamity of the soul, feed a Red who might write such as the above. It is not so much that the abject depravity doesn&rsquo;t weaken them, but that it instead fuels that which is weakness into a celebrated &ldquo;strength.&rdquo; An uninhibitedly triumphant suicidal frenzy, that must destroy not only us, but themselves also in the process. You can&rsquo;t call it racial masochism or sociopolitical pacifism, because the sadistic and power hungry aspect is clearly present. It twists and turns like a drunken man&rsquo;s overfed stomach, with only vomit and bile as its only tangible products in the end.</p>
<p>That this ending purge and following emptiness satisfies them, and that they devoutly believe it does, is what is most chilling to both behold and endure!</p>

		<p>The New York State Regents exam&rsquo;s aproach to Islam amounts to &#8220;Islamic proselytizing on the one hand, versus the inculcation of cynicism, if not contempt, for Christianity, and Western Christian civilization on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one should be shocked.  Schooling in America is essentially a government monopoly.  Governments are highly susceptible to organized racial, ethnic and religious pressure groups.  New York University research professor Diane Ravitch explains how these dynamics play out in the creation of history textbooks for public schools:</p>
<p>&#8220;The world history textbooks [she examined] consistently shade or omit facts that might offend any racial, ethnic, or religious group.  This does not occur by happenstance.  Most of the books prominently identify an advisory board that includes representatives of religious and ethnic groups.  Three publishers  &mdash;  Glencoe, Houghton-Mifflin, and Prentice-Hall  &mdash;  rely on the same individual from the Council on Islamic Education to review their Islamic content.  This may account for the similarity of their material on Islam as well as their omission of anything that would enable students to understand conflicts between Islamic fundamentalism and Western liberalism.  Some textbooks have multicultural advisory committees that include representatives of Jewish, Ukranian-American, Native-American, Asian American, and Afrocentric organizations.  Publishers that invite representatives of religious and ethnic groups to review their materials before publication are practicing self-censorship.&#8221;  (THE LANGUAGE POLICE, p147)</p>
<p>The same dynamics are at work in advertiser-supported media which is why coverage and analysis of diversity issues is similarly distorted and misleading.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, a well-known cable news network runs its &#8220;Religious Freedom&#8221; programming, while, at the same time, wondering what is to be done about &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;. Well, if I have the right to my own religious beliefs, which include ones that say that Islam is not a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;, but a religion of war, conquest, and total submission, why do I (and everyone else believing such) get branded as having some sort of mental illness? Islam and Muslims ARE to be feared!</p>
<p>A news headline online (on some uber-liberal blog) today says &#8220;Islamophobia&hellip;What are the roots of this alarming phenomenon?&#8221; Somehow it is sick to identify one&rsquo;s enemy??? Somehow reason, along with self-preservation, are to be disposed of lest one &#8220;offfend&#8221;??? (horrors!)</p>

		<p>How is it possible for so-called educators to promote such swill? Any look at Islam shows a history of destruction and oppression. A &#8220;love of art, beauty and learning&#8221;? It&rsquo;s always been primitive and barbaric. The dynamiting of the Bamyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan is emblematic of the actual nature of Islam.</p>

		<p>Ask the people of Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece about Islam, I think we know better because of our six hundred years of wars with the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>King Constantin Brancoveanu of Valachia(Romania) and his four sons were captured by the turks and asked to covert to Islam.</p>
<p>The king refused and they beheaded his older son, he refused again and again while they beheaded the other three sons and finally they beheaded him too.</p>
<p>Their heads were then put on poles and paraded through the streets of Istanbul( Constantinopolis).</p>
<p>And finally the real story of Vlad the Impaler, he impaled muslims who were trying to conquer our country.</p>
<p>There are many other true stories like these.</p>
<p>Western Europe and America are completely ignorant about Islam but their descendants will learn.</p>
<p>There are no mosques that I know of in Romania.<br>

		<p>#2, do you not think Moslems are doing these very same things behind closed doors?  Christianity and Judaism also prohibit such actions as extramarital and homosexual conduct, though some of their followers commit these sins and a few errant priests, pastors, and rabbis condone them.  Rich Moslem men are notorious for going abroad in order to consume alcohol and fornicate. <br>
 <br>
If anyone ever wonders about the level of hatred that liberals have for Christians and Jews, just consider their constant and vehement support for a religion that mandates subjugation of females and allows pedophilia, polygamy, and ritual murder.  </p>

		<p>This whole curricula change is motivated by one factor - fear of Islam and a desire to ingratiate the &#8220;educators&#8221; with the potentially violent and murderous practitioners of this barbaric and murderous religion/ideology.</p>
<p>A good illustration of this underlying fear is the outrage being expressed at the proposed burning of the Koran; burning of the Bible, indeed, of all Bibles, would illicit no such sense of righteous outrage from our &#8220;elites.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the usual liberal posturing, painting themselves as &#8220;courageous&#8221; when in fact they&rsquo;re, for the most part, moral and physical cowards.</p>

		<p>I believe that the Western European-American elite have made their own separate peace with Islam and this pro-Islam teaching is their mandate to soften the population for conversion.  Most of them don&rsquo;t believe in God anyway, they just pay lip service to Him to hold onto power.  Do you think they give a damn if they have to call him Allah?  They want to fundamentally change Western civilization and what better way to do it than change the religion?  Islam suits their agenda much better than Judaism or Christianity, both of which have subversive &#8220;fight the power&#8221; elements to them.  In Islam, Might makes Right.  It&rsquo;s the best thing to happen for the elite since the idea of predestination made starving populations buy the notion that we are all in our appointed stations and wanting something better for our lives is flying in the face of God.</p>
<p>In England, you have Prince Charles talking up Islam and you even have what should be one of Christianity&rsquo;s most ardent defenders, the Archbishop of Canterbury, suggesting that all Christians in the West start calling God &#8220;Allah,&#8221; like those in Muslim countries.  Do you think he would don a turban, convert and lead the call to prayer to Allah if he got to hold onto his cushy position?  Hell, yes.  In a New York City minute.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insane to look to our White elite for any decisive leadership against Islam.  They have proven repeatedly throughout history that they will sell the White people they govern out to any and every interest that comes strolling down the pike.</p>
<p>Not that Christianity is any great shakes anymore.  The vast majority of Christian clergymen are men without chests.  They will appease TPTB rather than lose their income tax deferments.  </p>
<p>My feeling is a little too out there for most people, but I think the smartest thing for most White people to do is investigate Islam with a mind to converting.  Sometimes, the best way to control a damaging trend is to get ahead of it. Maybe more White Muslims can make the religion less off the wall.</p>

		<p>And these are the same people who shrieked about Jerry Falwell.  This isn&rsquo;t about religion,  it&rsquo;s racial.  The vast majority of Muslims are non-white, and Islam itself is an alien philosophy destructive of Western civilization.  The Left is obsessed with destroying white people and their culture and nations, it is a genocide movement, the only important thing about it,  and it can only exist because quisling &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; make sure that the Left&rsquo;s white-hating racism never becomes an issue.  This is their job in the system, it&rsquo;s how they get their paychecks.  </p>

This is the same country we are led to believe is our ally in the war against Islamic extremism. There is also a part 2 to this article.</p>
<p>If you ever hear anyone defending multiculturalism, or Sharia, think of this; and think of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali woman who underwent female genital mutilation and who has become the voice of Muslim women who are trying to break out the bonds of this barbaric culture. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, Chicago.   What art?   What learning?</p>
<p>BEAUTY, at least human beauty, is to them something to cover up and hide.  <br>
ART, except for geometrical patterns, is something they condemn as &#8220;sinful&#8221; and have destroyed. Music is also &#8220;sinful&#8221; and is forbidden to strict Muslims.  <br>
LEARNING is, to them, simply a matter of rote memorizing   &mdash;   mostly of the Koran and religious matters. It has nothing to do with inquiry or innovation, which would also be considered heretical. You just shut up and believe;  don&rsquo;t ask questions! (That&rsquo;s learning?)<br>

		<p>The seven centuries of Islamic &#8220;rule&#8221; - conquest and enslavement - of the Iberian peninsula were a period of brutality, cruelty and intolerance. It is a total myth that it was a time of enlightenment or peace and happiness. Likewise the five centuries of enslavement at the other side of Europe in the Balkans was marked by sloth, backwardness, economic atropthy and barbarism. Much of the problems in the Balkans today are rooted in their period of Ottoman enslavement.</p>

<p>Interesting&hellip; I have always noticed that Christian whites always assume everyone else are Christians because they are white.  It is an old error, equating race and religion, but this most often occurs among people who are less educated, and not traveled.  Is it possible to be a race realist and know that race and relgion is not a constant? Yes!</p>
<p>It is also important to not equate national origin with religion.  Until recently, nationality was correlated with race, and that was because for example, if you were British, it meant that you were a certain combination of white ethnicities with a clear national feeling.  This hardly exists in the West anymore, while it is stronger than ever in non-white regions of the world.  Some rightly see this as the problem for the West and eventually the world because when the influence of the Western White World is deminished enough, nothing will be replacing it but hordes and hordes of non-whites who expect to benefit from a strong, and white managed West.  This will be the formula for world scale chaos and a series of events that will quickly reduce the populations of the world.  </p>

		<p>EEuro is correct.  Vlad Dracul is a hero in Romania, and for some very good reasons.  At the time the Turks were attacking with a view to overrunning the rest of Europe via his country, he appealed for help from Western Europe-even the Pope-and all found an excuse as to why they couldn&rsquo;t help.  So he did it his way, using psychological warfare.  As the poster stated, Romania is probably mosque free.</p>
<p>I am certain this is not being taught in the schools.</p>
<p>On another note, there is no such thing as Islamophobia.  A phobia indicates a fear of something which is not dangerous. Time and again, Islam has shown just how dangerous it is.  I am sad for our young, who are being shielded from the terrible truth.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s put this myth of Arab/Muslim enlightenment and culture to rest in it&rsquo;s grave finally, can we.  The wonderful scientific, medical, cultural and artistic advances everybody attributes to the Arabs CAME FROM - wait for it - JEWS.  All that enlightenment and advancement the liberals and the Arabs like to point to came during the period - early in the rise of Islam - that they respected Jews as brothers, and invited them into their enclaves and cities.  We all know Jews are greatly intellectual and artistic, even if some of us don&rsquo;t like Jews.  Well, the great enlightenment and period of cultural enrichment the Arabs are credited for came from the respect for Jewish cultural and intellectual contributions.  Jewish medical, scientific, architectural and artistic tradesmen and professionals. Once the muslims began hating Jews, they descended back into their tribal barbarity, and please tell me what cultural advances Muslims have contributed in the last 800 or 1000 years?  </p>

<p>I see it a little differently. I don&rsquo;t think they have made any peace with Islam, and I most definitely don&rsquo;t think they would ever want to see it take over. (It would be disastrous for them.)  Nor do they have the slightest wish to convert.   &mdash;  - Nor any expectation that they ever will. </p>
<p>The whole thing is that they just don&rsquo;t see Islam as a threat. They feel so secure in their lives that it&rsquo;s hard for them to imagine it taking over.  For historical reasons, certain leftist groups have a strong, ingrained commitment to  tolerance as an unquestioned principle, an abstraction, even in regards to something they may dislike or which may be hostile to them. Just because they tolerate it doesn&rsquo;t mean they like it.  But they see no real danger, so they don&rsquo;t take it seriously. To them (both in Europe and America), Islam is just a minor, odd cult that presents no  immediate threat to their   security or way of life. That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t worry about it.  With some groups, because of their historical dependence on tolerance, which has become an obsession raised to a shibboleth above any question or  doubt, they see opposition to Islam as silly paranoia and quite laughable. And something that could potentially backfire on them.  And of course,  all good Leftists like to consider themselves  multi-cultural and like to show off how tolerant they are.  Being  &#8220;more tolerant than thou&#8221; is one of the requisite hallmarks of a good leftie.  It&rsquo;s de rigueur.  It&rsquo;s often required in order to have a career or to advance in certain professions. </p>
<p>In short: they don&rsquo;t love Islam;  they don&rsquo;t intend to convert;  they don&rsquo;t foresee any reason to do so. </p>
<p>This insouciant attitude could well come back to bite them, but they don&rsquo;t see that, and they can&rsquo;t even imagine it.  They just don&rsquo;t take the Islamic threat that seriously, and they scoff at those who do.   They don&rsquo;t hear the wolf howling at the door.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway!</p>
