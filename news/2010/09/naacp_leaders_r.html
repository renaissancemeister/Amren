			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as the NAACP engages in a tense debate over same-sex marriage, the group&rsquo;s leaders have begun reaching out more forcefully to gay rights groups.</p>
<p>The outreach has been steered by former chairman Julian Bond and the group&rsquo;s president, Benjamin Jealous. Both men are supporters of same-sex marriage rights, though the NAACP&rsquo;s national board has taken no stance on the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The NAACP is opposed to discrimination in all its forms,&#8221; Jealous said in an e-mail, adding, {snip}</p>
<p>Bond, who spoke at the National March for Equality organized by gay rights groups last fall, has compared the push for same-sex marriage to the civil rights movement of the 1960s, which he helped lead. {snip}</p>
<p>Other members of the NAACP, which has long had strong ties to the African American religious community, have resisted supporting same-sex marriage and, more broadly, gay rights. The Rev. Keith Ratliff Sr., national NAACP board member and state president for Iowa and Nebraska, has been a critic of same-sex marriage. He has called on Iowa lawmakers to begin the process of amending the Constitution to restrict marriage to between a man and a woman.</p>
<p>As a whole, African Americans are much more likely to think that homosexuality is morally wrong (64 percent) than are whites (48 percent) or Hispanics (43 percent), according to a 2009 survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. In Washington, black pastors helped lead a push against a same-sex-marriage bill that nevertheless became law.</p>

<p>I find it hilariously ironic that the NAACP president&rsquo; last name is &#8220;jealous,&#8221; for that is essentially what they are all about.  THey are jealous of what others have, and so they demand things like affirmative action and slavery reparations.</p>

		<p>Although I am not a fan of the liberal gay agenda and voted &#8220;yes&#8221; on Prop. 8, in a conflict between gays and blacks I would tend to sympathize with the gays. It is uncommon for gay people to violently attack others simply for being different. It is all too common for blacks to violently attack whites.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;homophobia&#8221; is thrown around far too often, but many blacks *are* guilty of genuine homophobia. For those Bantus, it is hatred of that which is different - the same thing that motivates their hatred of whites.</p>

		<p>There was an article in the New York Times earlier this year that discused changing attitudes toward homosexuality. The author quoted a professor who had conducted research that revealed that 33% of young men ranging form age 22-35 polled said that if they &#8220;were drunk enough&#8221;, or if it was &#8220;the right day&#8221; etc&hellip; that they may very well submit to having sex with another man.</p>

<p>There are many black gays, and not only the &#8220;down low&#8221; ones. Those who engage in recreational homosexuality are bisexuals so they are in essence homosexual. Black men carry Aids more than any other group, so they must engage in the behavior that they &#8220;hate&#8221; so much..</p>

		<p>Speaking of black homosexuals and bisexuals, here is something.</p>
<p> The study found that 28 percent of gay black men infected with HIV, compared with 18 percent of Hispanic men and 16 percent of white men.</p>
<p>Black men in the study were also least likely to be aware of their infection, with 59 percent unaware of their infection compared with 46 percent of Hispanic men and 26 percent of white men.</p>
<p>Age also plays a role. Among 18 to 29-year-old men, 63 percent did not know they were infected with HIV, compared with 37 percent of men aged 30 and older, the team reported in the CDC&rsquo;s weekly report on death and disease.</p>

<p>WELL SAID, Anonymous.  I actually laughed when I read this article, thinking to myself &#8220;Yeah&hellip;right&hellip;as if&hellip;&#8221;  Unfortunately, some of the militants would probably embrace the NAACP, but I would tell them to go to hell.  My allegience is with Europeans and European Americans above all else, and I know I&rsquo;m far from being the only one who feels this way.</p>

<p>Sounds like you are accepting of and &#8220;embracing&#8221; the gay lifestyle also, since you allow your own children to have gay friends. Where did all this PC tolerance come from? The reason younger people are more accepting of that lifestyle is because their own parents have okayed it. Not to mention the amount of brainwashing on TV, MTV, Hollywierd, the media as a whole, and our own government.</p>
<p> As for &#8220;conservative groups&#8221; accepting it, they are not conservatives to begin with. They most certainly are NOT traditional conservatives. They are neocons and left of right.</p>

		<p>In black africa, there has never been any term such as &#8216;gay&rsquo; (until they read about this stuff from abroad) as men having sex with men was simply part of normal tribal life. Alright, do a little research about Greeks, ah yes, the 300. Not at all unusual. So don&rsquo;t go overboard about this subject. The Bible doesn&rsquo;t like it and the Koran demands &#8216;gays&rsquo;  be hurled to their death from a high place. In UK, one of the most talented men breaking the ENIGMA code during WW2 was a &#8216;gay&rsquo; but not &#8216;outed&rsquo; until his usefulness was expended then he committed suicide. I&rsquo;m not &#8216;gay&rsquo; but I do recognize the contribution they have made to society, that is their talents, not because they are &#8216;gay. After all, there must be lots of totally useless &#8216;gays&rsquo;. I also support the left handed lesbian wales, but only the black ones, and they must have educational special needs. </p>

<p>Gay Black Man. I do not doubt your story. I remember the situation involving congressmen Bob Allen here in Florida a few years ago. Moreover, someone posted a link from the Smoking gun on another post on this board about a month ago where a &#8220;married family man&#8221; who was a White professional was being blackmailed by a Black man he had had sex with.  </p>
<p>However, it is true that Blacks are more homophobic than other races.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not approve of homosexuality. What I said was that my children (who are adults) have a number of gay friends. I also said that a number of conservative groups and individuals <br>
have come out in support of gay marriage and homosexuality.<br>
It is a fact.</p>
<p>In regards to my children they are grown people and they make their own decision on whom they choose to be friends with. I cannot &#8220;allow&#8221; them to do anything.</p>
<p>Do not put words in my mouth. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t hate gays but I confess to loathing the gay agenda. Some gays aren&rsquo;t part of it; some even post here. Those in quiet, productive lives like most whites, I&rsquo;d welcome to our just struggle for self-determination. Organized gay support – and for that matter feminist support – for PC diversity helps doom all whites, even misguided liberals.</p>
<p>I keep asking a gay person, near and dear to me, how he thinks gays will fare in a black, hispanic or muslim America. His strictly lame responses reflect that his designated opponents are conservative white men – even though whites are about the only people who DON&rsquo;T wish gays violence. Minority rights are a Western invention which will vanish with our civilization. One of liberalism&rsquo;s deep dark secrets is how much it counts on &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; (most whites, more or less) to make its utopia work even a little. The diversity empire will collapse when whites divorce it. Look what&rsquo;s befallen every American big city. </p>
<p>Go preach gay rights (or feminism) to ghetto or barrio thugs or Koran thumpers and see what it gets you. As happened in famously liberal Holland, now overrun by muslims (one killed the gay film director Theo Van Gogh for criticizing &ldquo;the religion of peace&rdquo;), liberals grasp reality only when it assaults them – if then. Post-apartheid South Africa wrote &ldquo;gay rights&rdquo; into its &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; constitution. Why don&rsquo;t gays flock there? Is it the same reason most white South Africans want out? Can&rsquo;t libs see, no more whites = no more rights?</p>
<p>In my field, I&rsquo;ve known plenty of gays and never denied their rights. Ironically, many I find are ignorant, oppressive bigots when it comes to conservative straight white men. Yes, really: hate-filled idiots. Just for instance, bloody-minded, anti-southerner propaganda plasters the walls of one I know well: &ldquo;redneck&rdquo; is a racial slur. His ancestors were southerners.</p>
<p>Sorry, but organized gays array against whites, and strive to join blacks and other favored &#8220;minorities&#8221; (read: &ldquo;the majority&rdquo;) up on the pedestal – heaped with praise no matter how they truly behave. Full blast propaganda dubs those who fail to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; the latest diversity the latest &ldquo;haters&rdquo; whom the government must silence. Like other privileged groups, the day is coming when we&rsquo;ll be hit with lawsuits and worse if we don&rsquo;t have ENOUGH gays in our business or life, or when we just don&rsquo;t &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; them enough for their taste. Any distaste – which most people in most times and places have expressed for homosexuality – is what militant gays deem oppression. They&rsquo;re marching in the &ldquo;rainbow coalition&rdquo; to crush dissent. If they help enforce the death march across diversity&rsquo;s wasteland, the majority&rsquo;s contempt can only grow. What will gays achieve in the long run?</p>
<p>I know this is not the place to discuss &ldquo;gay rights&rdquo; – lately deemed to include gay marriage, opposed by the majority, and scrapping the liberal Clinton Administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; policy that the military wishes to keep. I re-stress: I don&rsquo;t oppose adult citizens whose private consenting behavior isn&rsquo;t my own cup of coffee. I don&rsquo;t hate gays or wish them ill. But gays who see their real long-term interests had better fight for western civilization, the legacy of the hated white man. My loved one got mugged twice by blacks. I did ask if any &ldquo;rednecks&rdquo; ever assaulted him. I don&rsquo;t actually know if he grasps that being white today makes you far more of a target than being gay. Gays must learn the hard way.<br>

<p>I think the key word is tend, but another thing is the fact that you can&rsquo;t really tell how many gay conservatives there are, simply because they blend in so well. I think that the very liberal gay culture (which is different from my more traditional values) takes an extreme of being the opposite of conservatives in every way. If it is the &ldquo;liberal thing&rdquo; to do, it must be the &ldquo;gay friendly&rdquo; thing to do and thus, not only be accepted by the &ldquo;gay community&rdquo; but also embraced. </p>

I have experienced more homophobia from African Americans than I have European Americans, but I don&rsquo;t believe homophobia is hereditary. Black youth (and white youth for that matter) are typically more tolerant than previous generations. It has been my experience that people aren&rsquo;t necessarily opposed to homosexuality, but rather opposed to a lot of the &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; that comes with it (pride parades, drag queens, etc)</p>

		<p>&#8220;The NAACP is opposed to discrimination in all its forms&rdquo; unless the people being discriminated against are white; in that case discrimination is fine.</p>
<p>This seems like a cynical attempt to build up supporters and influence; after all, gays are more prosperous, on average, than heterosexuals.  However, this strategy is likely to backfire, as the average black is strongly against homosexuality.  Homosexuality is punishable by death in some African countries, Jamaicans celebrate killing &#8220;batty boys&#8221; in their music, and rappers see no problem in saying they can&rsquo;t stand homosexuals, an opinion that would get white musicians in hot water.</p>
<p>This seems similar to the rather ingenuous attempts to form a &#8220;black-brown coalition&#8221;, united against evil whitey, which failed because of innate differences between the constituent groups.</p>
