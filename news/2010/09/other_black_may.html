			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Tumulty and Perry Bacon Jr., Washington Post, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once welcomed as a reformist mayor, he developed a leadership style that was criticized as aloof and autocratic. Budget cuts produced clashes with public employees and alienated some of the most important constituencies in the city.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the hope he once inspired gave way to suspicion of his &#8220;post-racial&#8221; brand of politics.</p>
<p>That, of course, was the narrative of Adrian Fenty&rsquo;s rise and fall as mayor of Washington. But the circumstances he faced are not unique. Most of those statements could also describe the political arc of Mayor Cory Booker in Newark, Mayor Michael Nutter in Philadelphia, and Mayor David Bing in Detroit.</p>
<p>Booker has received glowing reviews nationally for his leadership. On Friday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who met Booker at a conference in July, is expected to announce a gift of $100 million to improve the city&rsquo;s troubled schools. But skepticism of Booker has grown within the city. He had to campaign aggressively and spend $5.5 million more than his opponents to win reelection earlier this year with 58 percent of the vote. It was a sizeable victory, but a 13 percentage point drop from his landslide in 2006.</p>
<p>Nutter  &mdash;  whose approval among African-Americans has polled a third lower than among whites  &mdash;  could face a difficult battle next year for a second term, even though his most likely opponents are white and the city, with a black plurality, has a history of voting along racial lines.</p>
<p>Bing, a former National Basketball Association star and business executive, was accused of &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; when he ordered the bulldozing of more than 10,000 houses in blighted neighborhoods that he hopes to convert to parks and urban farms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To white ears, the word &#8220;post-racial&#8221; sounds like progress. But to African-Americans  &mdash;  particularly those who struggle daily with the lingering effects of generations of discrimination   &mdash;  it can feel like abandonment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Fenty&rsquo;s overwhelming initial win blurred the continued racial bifurcation in the city, and fed into the post-racial narrative that many of us wanted to feel, even if we really didn&rsquo;t believe it deep down inside,&#8221; said Cornell Belcher, a black pollster who advised President Obama&rsquo;s campaign in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethnic politics is still very much alive and well in big-city politics,&#8221; Belcher added. &#8220;Can you bridge the ethnic politics, or at least not trigger them in a negative way? Yes. But you have to be strategically cognitive of it. You can&rsquo;t pretend that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, because we are somehow post-racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest wave of African-American mayors has faced a different set of challenges than the earlier generation who arose from the activism of the 1960s  &mdash;  predecessors like Marion Barry in Washington, Sharpe James in Newark, and Coleman Young in Detroit. {snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, the elections of this new breed of mayor were in many ways a direct result of the disappointment that followed when those breakthroughs for African-Americans did not solve other problems with crime, bad schools and unemployment.</p>
<p>The new generation is what Bruce Katz, director of the Brookings Institution&rsquo;s Metropolitan Policy Program, describes as &#8220;uber-pragmatists&#8221;  &mdash;  forging alliances with corporate interests and prosperous suburbs, encouraging gentrification, hiring outsiders to fill key jobs, inviting in private foundations that see the inner cities as testing grounds for their ideas.</p>
<p>Philip Thompson, a professor of urban studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls them &#8220;technocrats,&#8221; who view most problems in terms of management and resources, rather than culture or politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The jobs they have eliminated  &mdash;  sanitation workers in Newark, bus drivers in Detroit-are the path out of poverty for many, particularly African Americans. The teachers fired while Fenty was mayor, many of them middle-aged African Americans, are also symbols of the possibility of taking another step up the economic ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of the African American middle class in these cities are public sector workers who work for the city,&#8221; said Fred Siegal, a Cooper Union professor who has studied urban governance.</p>
<p>And while Nutter avoided widespread layoffs, the alternative was a hike in sales taxes, which hit the poor the hardest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t helped that, in some instances, these mayors have not been politically attuned to some of the relationships that undergird their communities. Just as Fenty was criticized for failing to make the rounds of black churches, the Detroit News has reported Bing&rsquo;s absence from places like Big D&rsquo;s Barber Shop, where his predecessors would often be found mixing it up with the regulars.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk about barbershops, that&rsquo;s old politics,&#8221; Bing said when asked about that report. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have time for that; we have a city that is in crisis. My first eight months, I had to stay in the office to fix problems. You have to be focused.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Fenty learned the hard way, different parts of a city can have very different views of a mayor&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The demographic breakdown of support for Nutter on these poll questions follows a consistent pattern, with the mayor doing better among whites than blacks, better among high-income residents than people with less income, and better among college graduates than those who are less well-educated,&#8221; the think tank wrote.</p>
<p>Fenty fell victim to that same divide, which is becoming a paradox of urban politics in the 21st century. How well these other mayors deal with it may well determine their political survival  &mdash;  and the success of their cities.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t have made a difference in the final vote, but what had to steam black voters in D.C. the most when it came to Fenty-ordered teacher layoffs is that the woman behind it, Michelle Rhee, replaced them all with barely English literate H-1B visa holding Asians.  I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to get fired because of incompetence, how much would it hurt you to see a bigger incompetent go in your place?</p>
<p>As for Facebook&rsquo;s Zuckerberg&rsquo;s &#8220;donation&#8221; to Newark   &mdash;   Like I said here a few days ago, Facebook &#8220;stock&#8221; has no value, because it&rsquo;s not publicly traded.  It&rsquo;s all a PR stunt to sell the Facebook smartphone.</p>

		<p>Fenty in D.C. and Bing in Detroit are victims of black racism. Fenty was defeated by another black who demonized his opponent as catering to the whites in the metro area. Bing is seen by local blacks in the same light. Black voters in both areas have decided that having a chief executive who works for the whole city isn&rsquo;t good enough. Those malcontents will not be happy without another set of fireball racists like Coleman Young in Detroit and Marion Berry in D.C.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the old black churches in the south. They had a brown stripe of paint on the doorway that marked the darkest shade of brown that was acceptable for a parishioner. Fenty and Bing are not black enough for inner city voters.</p>

<p><br>
Well guess what, Mr. Belcher, those of us over on the white side of that &#8220;racial bifurcation&#8221; really aren&rsquo;t believing that &#8220;post-racial narrative&#8221; deep down inside, either. Not believing it about these black mayors; and <i>certainly</i> not believing it about your main-man President Obama. </p>
<p>Nice use of the word &#8220;bifurcation&#8221;, though. <br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s watch for 2012 headlines that say black mayors grapple with forces that led to obama&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
<p><br>
Epic Fail-  Glenn Beck had D&rsquo;Souza on the show today examining the origins of Obama&rsquo;s rage against White Humanity.  When talking about Obama&rsquo;s radical black mentor, Frank Marshall Davis, Beck mentioned that he had a huge FBI file.  Epic Fail D&rsquo;Souza- didn&rsquo;t say, &#8220;Right, but we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s bigger than Rev. Martin Luther King&rsquo;s FBI file, because it is sealed.  Hey,  Glenn, given how much you know about MLK, what do you think might be in that FBI file on your hero?  Why is it sealed?  Don&rsquo;t ya think it will be &#8216;lost&rsquo; before it&rsquo;s ever unsealed?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Blacks do not want a politician who is pragmatic, they want a politician who will give them stuff.  They do not want a mayor who encourages business growth, they want their reparations.  Our major cities are like Zimbabawe, as long as the mayor takes from whitey and gives to blacks everything is ok.  In the American sense that means welfare and public sector/affirmative action jobs.  They do not understand basic economics.  If Mayor Fenty had ordered home invasions of white property and given those homes to blacks he would have been a hero to blacks.  Even though there are only a limited number of whites to take from, and that fountain dries up fast, they still would have approved.  Rather like the farm invasions in Zimbabwe.  Although a small number of blacks realize that the white commerical farmers are their only hope for long term economic survival, and are frequently killed for defending their employers, the majority think that just by being given what the white man has will make them wealthy.  A mayor who understands that driving out the white tax payer destroys the fiscal basis for his city&rsquo;s entitlement system might as well be speaking ancient Egyptian to the black voter.  They just do not get it.</p>
<p>In addition to the &#8220;get YT&#8221; mentality of most blacks this thought process goes hand in hand with their belief in magic.  They truly do not understand the hard work that goes into maintaining a complex economy.  It is beyond them.  They really believe that if you &#8220;pray on it&#8221; the lord will provide in some mystical way.  The &#8220;teach a man to fish&#8221; concept is way beyond their mental prowess.</p>

		<p>This is a beautiful story. Blacks left to themselves always<br>
destroy everything&hellip;as the catastrophe mounts they reach<br>
compulsively toward any indication of &#8220;racism&#8221; to blame for the <br>
failure<br>
With no whites handy..as in Wash DC they turn on each other.<br>
It is absolutely hilarious to watch Racism become the <br>
central topic in the Mayors race where all 12 candidates are<br>
BLACK. Now they are screaming that coal black men are secretly<br>
whites in disguise.</p>

		<p>Post-racial to blacks means they get to call the shots and whites have to give up their money, power, children, and women to blacks.  It means letting every other race but whites have freedom of association.  That&rsquo;s what post-racial means to blacks</p>

		<p>Most whites seriously underestimate how desperate and dependent blacks are for government jobs and government payola.  To the garden variety white, having a gub&rsquo;ment job might be a nice thing but not a complete necessity.  For African Americans living mostly in households headed by single mothers, it means the difference between having a roof over their heads and living on the street.  This overdependence on government spending is upping the stakes for blacks at the same time whites are giving up on the government.  When whites think of machine politics they think of Tamny Hall one hundred thirty years ago.  For blacks it is here right now.     </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t go wrong with Malthus-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;Must it not then be acknowledged by an attentive examiner of the histories of mankind, that in every age and in every State in which man has existed, or does now exist <br>
That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence,</p>
<p>That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and,</p>
<p>That the superior power of population it repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice.&#8221;[9]<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus</a></p>
<p>**Don&rsquo;t let the unwanted breed and overrun like locusts any and all competitors _as a struggle between races as classes_ and they will be made forever miserable by the enforced discipline of inhibited instinct as much as actual privation.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;The way in which these effects are produced seems to be this. We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population&hellip; increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease, while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great that population is at a stand.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus</a></p>
<p>**Provide an excess and the surplus is rapidly taken up through increased breeding as the only &#8216;freedom&rsquo; (to demand more, with a louder voice) available.  Such profit as this surplus generates goes to taxes and welfare which then increases the population growth again.</p>
<p>The problem with Malthus is that he fails to note that the &#8216;virtue&rsquo; of man in working hard to achieve success -is- that of wanting cheaper labor to till more land (or whatever service/manufacturing/resource jobs you apply this to) so that he can work -less-.</p>
<p>It is an investment scheme with Ponzian outcomes for the class or race you put beneath yourself.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the enablement process only applies to the people who have the least reproductive numbers overall and thus the largest control over the monetary (as capitalization) supply (because they don&rsquo;t have to revest large amounts of wealth into themselves).</p>
<p>Thus, by creating whatever passes for &#8216;poor laws&rsquo; in a given age, they are essentially buying for themselves incrementalism as a means to stave off the approach of the irrepressible masses, while at the same time destabilizing their nearest competitors in the class immediately below them (whose taxes they spend) as a means of limiting their total capitalization.</p>
<p>The poor are fed to breed and the middle class are chained to the support of the poor and rich.</p>
<p>In this, it is NOT the creation or allocation of lower class jobs that is most important to today&rsquo;s rising national crisis.  But the creation of the masses themselves.</p>
<p>Because those masses, once started as a landslide inertia of building numbers, will breed to the point where -no amount- of compensatory leveraging (say: extortionary payoff) will serve to make them happy as the stressed earners adopt wealthy class breeding habits and no longer reproduce themselves sufficient to provide the ever greater taxable funds of a social welfare system run amok.</p>
<p>And that is why no black can promise enough to enough other blacks to make this &#8216;post racial&rsquo; idea work.  Because the high IQ black is where he ought to be.  But his people&rsquo;s Bell Curve is so much shorter overall that his his/her exceptionalism doesn&rsquo;t include a large enough proportion of secondary middle-curve = middle class alternatives to replace the white losses.</p>
<p>When a black complains that a smart black is acting white by denying him his daily bread, cable and booze/drugs, what he&rsquo;s really saying is that he knows he&rsquo;s not able to move up and why isn&rsquo;t &#8216;the brother&rsquo; milking the whites instead anymore?</p>
<p>Such hostile exo-group divisions is how the Elites hope to make class separations work, forever.  By denying us the common identity base by which to make revolutionary counter (no more federal spending from this tax base) work.</p>
<p>But I doubt if even they had Detroit in mind when they instigated the process of reverse enablement.</p>
<p>And I doubt if they understand the level of intensity a three way competition could inspire by importing a smarter level of Hispanic replacement for the black lower class.</p>
<p>There is no way out of this.</p>

		<p>The problems and causations listed above are close to the mark but there is a small element that no one realizes unless you live here.  I&rsquo;m within artillery range of DC and have been here for quite some time.  Fenty is half White and I know his mother since she is Italian.  THe purist blacks here thought it would be business as usual with no-show jobs, double extra staffing for gum&rsquo;ment jobs, tickets to events, etc.  Fenty tried to do what was correct and since he treated everyone equally, it counted against him.  How dare he have a White female police chief when the last one, a black guy, falsified arrest records and crime classifications to show that crime was weirdly decreasing.  All the blacks wanted was another marion barry.  WHen Fenty authorized legal checkpoints aka Iraq roadblocks in ghetto public housing, the crime dropped but the blacks howled.  Someday, people will realize that the black are nothing more than a drain on the city.  I&rsquo;m part of group that is resettling the city or gentrifying it by buying up auctioned homes for the deliquent taxes.  It&rsquo;s amazing when the places clean up and the blacks just shuffle away in shock.</p>
