<h1><a href="https://post-gazette.com/pg/10260/1088116-153.stm?cmpid=bcpanel0">Steele Seems Slow to Grasp Issues of Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Norman, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele {snip} the highest-ranking negro in the GOP has always been quick to trade on racial stereotypes if he thought they could bring him even a scintilla of political or cultural cachet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Steele can always be counted on to scrupulously look the other way when black folks are insulted by powerful white conservatives like Rush Limbaugh. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Instead of a principled outreach campaign designed to broaden the Republican tent, all we ever get from Mr. Steele is more condescension and buck-dancing in high places.</p>
<p>{snip} here&rsquo;s how Mr. Steele weakly handled questions from CNN&rsquo;s John King about former House Speaker Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s latest putdown connected to the race of President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>King: Former Speaker of the House, the man who is moving around as if he might run for president, said that the president of the United States has a &#8220;Kenyan, anti-colonial&#8221; view of the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King: Is that an appropriate way to have this conversation, as a Republican leader and as a black man? Is that how you want to have this conversation?</p>
<p>Steele: I don&rsquo;t see what being black has to do with it, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>King: You don&rsquo;t think saying the president has a &#8220;Kenyan, anti-colonial&#8221; worldview is perhaps trying to play to the lowest common denominator in politics?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King: So, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s race-baiting or playing to the birther crowd?</p>
<p>Steele: No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t see that stretch. I know some folks out there want to, but I don&rsquo;t see that. I know Newt. I know that&rsquo;s not his mindset on that. He&rsquo;s talking about a worldview that comes from a different part, whether it&rsquo;s Europe, the African continent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The RNC chairman&rsquo;s knee-jerk defense of Mr. Gingrich is so bizarre and off-putting that even a normally unflappable CNN anchor has to wonder whether he&rsquo;s being punked. How is such intellectual laziness and obsequiousness by a black politician even possible in the post-1865 world?</p>
<p>Last weekend, the National Federation of Republican Women&rsquo;s board of directors threw a shindig in Charleston, S.C., that would have warmed the cockles of Mr. Steele&rsquo;s heart. Photos of the gala called &#8220;The Southern Experience&#8221; have begun circulating.</p>
<p>The photos feature South Carolina&rsquo;s state Senate president, Glenn McConnell, dressed in Civil War clothing. In one photo, Mr. McConnell is flanked by two African-American Civil War re-enactors, a black man and woman dressed in antebellum slavery garb. All three are smiling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Usually, when black folks see photos like these, there is a lot of soul searching. We wonder aloud what it takes to make someone drop every vestige of dignity to embody the myth of the happy-go-lucky slave? What kind of paychecks are we talking about?</p>
<p>In a way, the photos of the &#8220;happy slaves&#8221; at the Southern Experience party shine a perverse light on Mr. Steele&rsquo;s tenure at the RNC. He&rsquo;s playing the role expected of him. It&rsquo;s just another example of the pro-colonial, know-your-place, anti-insurrection attitude Newt Gingrich considers deeply American.<br>

		<p>All I can say about Tony Norman is that he so proud to be black and is so proud of his heritage that he married a white woman. His criticism of Michael Steele is complete hypocrisy.  At least Mr. Steele married someone of his own race and ethnicity. Actions speak louder than words. So who is the real black man? </p>

		<p>If writer Norman is so concerned about &#8220;intellectual laziness&#8221; by a black politician, why doesn&rsquo;t he explore these flesh-and-blood examples:</p>
<p>Obama saying there are 57 states in the USA.</p>
<p>Obama bowing to the king of Saudi Arabia, the kingdom which bought millions of slaves from the African tribal chiefs.</p>
<p>Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter claiming he has &#8220;a First Amendment right not to get shot&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ex-New Orleans mayor, Ray Nagin, bellowing, &#8220;The Second Amendment does not apply in New Orleans&#8221;, when his police confiscated guns in the wake of Katrina.</p>
<p>These are just three examples. Granted, Steele isn&rsquo;t the brightest star in the sky when it comes to intellect, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be singled out.<br>

		<p>Blacks have been happy slaves of the democrats for years. They&rsquo;ve simply been moved from the plantation to the projects. Largely due to white liberal influence their families have been destroyed and a nihilistic, materialistic culture put in place.<br>
So who are really the &#8220;happy slaves&#8221;?</p>

<p>The endless attempt to make the Republicans to conform to blacks. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Neither can expect to be nominated for an NAACP Image Award this year.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If Mr. Norman is concerned about NAACP Image Awards, he should be addressing his attention to black rappers and characters like Flavor Flav:</p>

		<p>A lot of racism against blacks comes from the black community itself. The attacks against black conservatives like Mr. Steele are a good example of this. It&rsquo;s racist to presume that he should be obligated to support left-wing views and left-wing politicians because of his skin color. </p>

		<p>Michael Steele is a racist, just like Obama.  Plain and simple. I don&rsquo;t care what he says in this article, he has always put his race before anything else. &#8220;Conservative&#8221; blacks will always be black first, no matter what they try to tell us. That also goes for Mr. Snirdley, Rush&rsquo;s black sidekick.</p>
<p>Time for Whites to do the same. Matter of fact, it is way past time!</p>

		<p>Interesting how blacks are excoriated by their fellows and liberal whites should they have the temerity to stray off the Democrat-liberal plantation.  Disagree with ol&rsquo; Massa Obama, Mass Reid, or Missus Pelosi and you&rsquo;re a turn-coat.</p>
<p>Thus Dr. Thomas Sowell, Dr. Walter Williams, Dr. Keynes, Michael Steele and others like them are simply beyond the pale, &#8220;white man&rsquo;s n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -s.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Left in America is not only intellectually pathetic but morally disgusting as well.</p>

		<p>More whining from blacks.  If Republicans and whites in general don&rsquo;t kiss up to them, they&rsquo;re racists.  But once we do, suddenly we are just &#8216;using&rsquo; blacks.  You can&rsquo;t win with black people it seems.</p>
