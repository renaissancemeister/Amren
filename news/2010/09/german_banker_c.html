<h1>German Banker Comments Raise Concerns About New &#8216;Intellectual Racism&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Marquand, Christian Science Monitor, August 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A German central banker, who stirred controversy last week with disparaging remarks about Muslims living in Germany, is now being pressured to resign following his comment yesterday  &mdash;  widely perceived as anti-Semitic  &mdash;  that &#8220;all Jews share a certain gene.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thilo Sarrazin, a member of the left-leaning Social Democrats, a former finance minister of Berlin and current board member of Germany&rsquo;s Bundesbank, said a &#8220;Jewish gene&#8221; made Jews &#8220;different from other people&#8221; ahead of today&rsquo;s launch of his new book, &#8220;Germany Does Away With Itself: How We are Risking the Future of our Nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book critiques immigration policy in Germany, a hot topic around Europe, and makes genetic arguments about intelligence linked to ethnicity, suggesting that immigrants are not as gifted as Germans and that the country is losing its identity, becoming &#8220;smaller and stupider.&#8221;</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in yesterday saying the remarks were &#8220;utterly unacceptable&#8221; and that Mr. Sarrazin is likely to come before the Bundesbank board  &mdash;  though previous attempts to remove the banker from what is an independent body have failed. Last fall Sarrazin said the birthrate of Muslims threatened Germany&rsquo;s future and that he wished that it was &#8220;Eastern European Jews&#8221; that were reproducing quickly since &#8220;their IQs are 15 percent higher than that of the German people.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>A new &#8216;intellectual racism&rsquo; in Germany</b></p>
<p>The controversy comes amid a gradual mainstreaming of anti-Islamic feeling in Europe, including inflammatory depictions and often exaggerated projections about a continent on the verge of becoming a &#8220;Eurabia,&#8221; as the genre is often called, say analysts.</p>
<p>Kenin Kolat, head of the German Turkish Federation described Sarrazin as representing &#8220;the climax of a new intellectual racism that damages Germany&rsquo;s reputation abroad.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p><b>Misunderstood? or racist?</b></p>
<p>Yet a distance between official and popular sentiments in Germany were affirmed by such editorials in the Stuttgarter Nachrichten yesterday, suggesting Sarrazin &#8220;is only getting so much attention because he is saying what many people feel and experience every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarrazin on Sunday argues he is misunderstood, &#8220;I am not a racist.&#8221; He said his attacks are not on Turks or Arabs but on &#8220;the culture of Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pending book kicked up a firestorm last week as portions of it were serialized in newspapers, with passages such as this one: &#8220;I do not want the land of my grandchildren and great grandchildren to be predominantly Muslim, where Turkish and Arabic are spoken in broad sections of the country, where women wear a headscarf and where the daily rhythm of life is determined by the call of the muezzins.&#8221;</p>

		<p>More and more people believe just like him.  Probably the overwhelming majority of Europeans feel the same way.  Islam cannot be allowed to colonize Europe.  The leftists have always supported the muslims in defending their homeland against Western invaders, will they support Europeans when they are forced to do the same?  If the Bosnian war is any example, no.  </p>

		<p>Attempts to smear this guy as some kind of cryptic Neo Nazi because he said that &ldquo;all Jews share a certain gene&rdquo; is ridiculous in my opinion. He went on to say that they average 15 points higher on IQ tests than ethnic Germans and he would rather have them making babies in his country than Arabs. In point of fact, DNA testing has shown that all Jews except those in Ethiopia and India can trace their ancestry back to the near east, so calling the quote is Anti Semitic is just a silly scare tactic.  Oh, and he&rsquo;s a member of the left leaning social democrats; so I find it hard to believe he&rsquo;s a &#8220;looney right- wing racist.&#8221; And what he said was fundamentally true about third world immigration dumbing down Germany. Despite our much trumpeted first amendment free speech protections, why doesn&rsquo;t the US doesn&rsquo;t have someone like him willing to speak the truth about racial differences?   </p>

		<p>It might be helpful to the debate if the establishment would agree on what is to be unique about Germany. If it cannot be race, ethnicity, religion, or culture then what about language? So far as I can tell, all that will remain that is specific to Germany is the language. Let&rsquo;s debate the future of the language. It has been important in the past few centuries but now it is a minor league language. Going into the future, Spanish, Mandarin, English, and Arabic will be much more important. People that only speak German will be handicapped. So why not implement a 50 year program to gradually get rid of the language and replace it with English? I&rsquo;m asking Germany&rsquo;s leaders to not be sentimental but instead be tough and objective about this question. Certainly there has been no sentimentality about eradicating the German people so why be soft about the language?</p>

I read this story yesterday on a different website:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2adr36p" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2adr36p</a></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really going on overdrive to vilify this guy and that&rsquo;s the real story.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that on the website I posted, they allow comments. Read them. They&rsquo;re encouraging.</p>
<p>Many of the posts agree. The response is mostly, &#8220;well, of course distinct groups of people are going to have unique genetic profiles!&#8221;</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t stupid and they know it. What they&rsquo;re trying to do is get us to censor ourselves lest we see our lives and livelihoods destroyed as they&rsquo;re attempting to destroy Herr Sarrazin.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s Ok to turn Germany into the Balkans, but it&rsquo;s not Ok to simply talk about it. It&rsquo;s interesting that in Germany no one brought up the Holocaust in regards to this issue. I guess, for all the &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; of the left, actually preventing another holocaust type situation is low on their agenda. As Jared Taylor might say, wherever in the world there is racial or religions diversity, it it there you will find the most racism and strife and violence. The left seem eager to build a bonfire out of the situation.</p>

		<p>Germany is for Germans.  Their is a desructive mindset among white people that we have to take care of non-white people.  No, we don&rsquo;t.  Many white people wrongly think that somehow having non-white people closer to white people will turn them into honorary white people.  Non-white people will always be non-white whether they are East Asian or African.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incorrect and simplistic to state that &ldquo;all Jews share a certain gene.&#8221; There simply is not &#8220;Jew gene.&#8221;  However, geneticists have made some remarkable advances in mapping the human genome in the past 20 years.  Jews really are linked by blood, not just faith. The book to read here is Abraham&rsquo;s Children: Race, Identity, and the DNA of the Chosen People by Jon Entine.</p>
<p>So what will happen to Thilo Sarrazin?  He&rsquo;s been known to articulate publicly what many many Germans think and say privately about non-European immigration, and has managed to keep his job, but this time he may have crossed the line with his faux pas on the &#8220;Jew gene.&#8221;  To discuss things Jewish in Germany is to wander into a mine field.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting that Sarrazin gets the boot from the SPD (his political party)and the Bundesbank.</p>

		<p>Comment one is a bull&rsquo;s eye:</p>
<p>not UNTRUE, just NOT NICE. </p>
<p>I have lived mainly in Germany for 15 years (I&rsquo;m an American).</p>
<p>Sarrazon speaks for the VAST MAJORITY of Germans, who believe that Muslims CANNOT be assimilate in large numbers, and who would end the Muslims home in a hearbeat if they could.</p>
<p>In chastizing Sarrazin, one Berlin politician pointed out that 80% of the Turks in Germany come from the lowest strata of the Turkish population, not the bourgeoisie, and are very low intelligence, and that assimilation is hapening at a &#8220;snail&rsquo;s pace&#8221;</p>
<p>How does this refute Sarazin?????</p>
<p>(Merkel tut tuts and saysS is &#8220;not helpful&#8221;, but never: &#8220;he is lying.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Everyone knows he is right, the only thing left to do is berate him for being too blunt.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with many whites who were afraid to utter the word &#8220;black&#8221; aloud, out of fear that someone would take offense.  I once asked a co-worker, &#8220;Who&rsquo;s that good-looking black doctor out in the station?&#8221; only to be urgently shushed.  It must be the same with the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; in Germany.  </p>

		<p>I have always found statements that Hitler  was &#8220;evil&#8221; to be ambiguous and irrrelevant to the history of Germany and Europe. Hitler had ideas, many of which were grounded in fact, and many of which weren&rsquo;t. His concept of the Jews as a group impossible to assimilate into German society was erroneous, because many had assimilated and had little if not contact with Jewish culture. Others clearly retained customs that were not Germanic. Whether those customs were as intolerable as Hitler made them out to be can be debated, practice by practice.</p>
<p>However the German Army and even elements of the Nazi Party, to say nothing of the aristocracy and the nationalist parties prior to 1933, totally abandoned their responsiblity to rebuild and strengthen Germany by letting Hitler and his relatively small SS coterie exterminate a talented segment of German society. Most Jews would have served Germany well in WWII, as they did in WWI.<br>
Indeed, who would have won the war in Europe with men like Rommel working with Jewish scientists and free market economists?</p>
<p> A minority of Jews, Communists, radical socialists etc., could have been dealt with as gentile Communists were dealt with-legitimate enemies of Germany and indeed of Europe. Hitler and the Austrian anti-Semites he adored foolishly threw the intellectual firepower of the secular Jews out with the revolutionaries and hedonists that they despised.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to see recognition by a prominent German that if nations can no longer have totally pure ethnic populations, at least include those whose cultures are compatible with and indeed strengthen traditional and historical culture.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Germany, but based on everything I&rsquo;ve read (and heard from people who&rsquo;ve been there) I&rsquo;m inclined to believe you&rsquo;re closer to the truth than say, some idiot leftist who thinks the bulk of Germans love and welcome these peoples.</p>
<p>Indirectly, you&rsquo;ve exposed the one glaring flaw in the so-called Western democracies: there is NOTHING &#8220;democratic&#8221; about them!  </p>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/democracy" rel="nofollow">https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/democracy</a></p>
<p>Democracy (n.) - government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. </p>
<p>As anyone can see in a place like Germany (or France, Italy, the UK, America, etc) &#8220;supreme power&#8221; is not vested in &#8220;the people&#8221; (i.e. the electorate).  Rather, it&rsquo;s invested in a monied aristocracy that&rsquo;s of a decidedly plutocratic character.  These people, living their hedonistic lifestyles in their insular communities, are so far removed from the world around them they have no real concept of what their policies are doing to this planet.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care, either, as long as their bank accounts remain padded so they can continue funding their debased existences.  Their philanthropies are nothing more than attempts to show the &#8216;common folk&rsquo; how wonderful they are to them.  Every once in awhile their arrogance comes shining through in the form of a Freudian slip.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2a5d3c7" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2a5d3c7</a></p>
<p>Ethno-nationalist movements are the only ones that can rightfully claim to represent the interests of &#8220;the people&#8221;, as long as they don&rsquo;t take on a malevolent character, like Hitler&rsquo;s Nazism.</p>

		<p>For me alone the fact that it seems a first sign that Germany might openly be discussing this problem is cause for celebration. Everyone knows it has been bubbling away for a long time but politicians have ensured we all pretend it&rsquo;s not there.</p>

<p>This is but one example of the problems Germany has to put up with with the Turk community (helps if you understand German but should not be hard to understand the general gist of it, especially if you skip to halfway through).</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>There are certain things that are exempted from democratic  privileges or  debate in those so-called &#8220;democracies&#8221;.   Race, religion   &mdash;   and now immigration   &mdash;   being among them.  In the wake of WW2, those are treated as sacrosanct topics that are completely outside the realm of public debate, or voting, or anything else.  At their threshold, democracy ends.   Democracy does not extend to those &#8220;protected&#8221; topics.  They are simply a given and that&rsquo;s that; take it or leave it.  No discussion allowed.</p>
<p>Certain things are placed beyond the scope of democracy.  Limits are placed on freedom.  It&rsquo;s like saying there is no such thing as &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; for racists,  just as there is no such thing as freedom to murder your neighbor.  This is commonly accepted.</p>
<p>People in the West, who mistakenly think of Islam as just another religion, simply fail to &#8220;get&#8221; the point that Islam is not merely  a religion in the usual pattern of western religions    &mdash;    IT IS AN ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE   &mdash;   a religious AND POLITICAL ideology.  Thus, Moslems are not going to assimilate.  Their religion would forbid it.  Their families and entire society would forbid it.  And Islam deals harshly with those who deviate!   An &#8220;assimilated Moslem&#8221; would not be a Moslem.  No such thing!    <br>
 <br>
It&rsquo;s  a contradiction in terms,  like saying  &#8220;a converted Moslem&#8221;   &mdash;  -  What is that?!?!?</p>
