<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/index.php?nid=383&amp;sid=2050748">Swedish Nationalist Group Surges Amid Protests</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malin Rising, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Polls in Sweden show a small anti-immigration party is likely to enter Parliament for the first time in elections Sunday, despite attempts by vuvuzela-blowing protesters to disrupt the nationalist group&rsquo;s campaign rallies.</p>
<p>The Sweden Democrats are warning that lenient immigration policies are threatening the country&rsquo;s welfare system, and a series of recent surveys shows the party has climbed above the 4 percent threshold necessary to enter to the legislature.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the final days of campaigning, both blocs [center-right and left-wing] have warned voters against bringing the party into Parliament, saying it represents xenophobic views that don&rsquo;t belong in a country seen as tolerant and welcoming to refugees.</p>
<p>Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, advocates sharp cuts in immigration and has called Islam the greatest foreign threat to Swedish society since World War II.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters tried to drown out Akesson&rsquo;s speech in Stockholm on Thursday by chanting and making noise with vuvuzelas  &mdash;  plastic horns of the kind used by spectators at the football (soccer) World Cup in South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For us the priority is absolutely clear: we choose to restore the Swedish welfare system,&#8221; Akesson told a few dozen supporters who were shielded by 200 police officers from a much larger crowd of protesters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some 12,000 immigrants countrywide walked out of their jobs for five minutes Thursday as part of a Facebook protest against the Sweden Democrats, organizer Damon Rasti said. He said workers from all fields, including doctors, bus drivers and artists, participated in the event, which was aimed at showing that immigrants are essential to Swedish society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, the protests and demonstrations seem to have done little to diminish support for the Sweden Democrats.</p>
<p>Four different polls this week show Akesson&rsquo;s party getting between 4.1 and 7.5 percent of the vote. It&rsquo;s unclear whether it would get the chance to play kingmaker; several surveys show the center-right government is likely to retain its majority in Parliament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Akesson criticized the two blocs for ruling out cooperation with his party.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is what happens after Monday, that the others refuse to speak to us, then it is not our fault if there is parliamentary chaos,&#8221; he said, before police and bodyguards whisked him away to a waiting car.<br/>

<p>They are beginning to realize that you can&rsquo;t have a welfare state and 3rd world immigration. Sweden has been touted as a model for the world when it comes to its&rsquo; welfare state but had it had the 3rd world people America has always had, it never could have had the welfare state. When Scandinavians were all White and as such naive, they used to chastise America over race, now  they are learning the hard way through experience. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Typical brainless, juvenile tactics of the Left. But effective nontheless.</p>
<p>Make a disturbance! Chant! Shout!  Prevent your opponents from being heard! It does not matter who is right, only who is noisiest and who prevails.  Logic and justice are irrelevant.</p>
<p>As some canny poster here recently remarked, regarding law school training:   </p>
<p>&#8220;When the law does not support you, and the evidence does not support you, and logic does not support you &hellip; shout and pound the table!&#8221;</p>
<p>We can be sure that these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who staged their protests, were organized and  given careful training by the Left.    Somalis and such did not come up with these strategies on their own.  These have become standard techniques of the Left, everywhere. And they have proven very effective too, which is why they continue to be used.  Unless the Right comes up with equally effective means of combatting them, it will continue to back down - as it&rsquo;s done for the past half century.  </p>
<p>And no, voting does not seem to be the answer. Why?  All western &#8220;democracies&#8221; have had the vote all along, including Sweden, and despite that we have all seen the constant erosion and invasion of our countries for the past two or three generations, right under our noses while we have continued voting for this party or that, and hoping for a change which didn&rsquo;t come.  Thus, it&rsquo;s unlikely that more voting will suddenly turn that pattern around, other than a temporary reprieve at best.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>No!  Preserving welfare should not be their priority. In fact, that should be way down the list. Preserving Sweden&rsquo;s  unique national genetic base should be their priority. Once that is destroyed, it is gone for good.  (And that is the objective of the Left.) </p>
<p>But this is Sweden, and I realize that anything even suggestive of race would be absolutely disallowed from the national debate. So they have to talk about welfare and economics, as if nothing else matters and race does not exist. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am sure the Left is not fooled. They will continue to revile the Sweden Democrats as a racist party, despite all its claims to the contrary.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad they couldn&rsquo;t walk out of the country, not just their jobs, and do so for 50 years, not just 5 minutes.  I suspect the reason the immigrants kept it to just 5 minutes is that if they quit their jobs for 5 weeks Swedes would find that their country runs just fine without them.</p>

		<p>I hope someone will correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I can&rsquo;t think of a single civic value or ideal that is more cherished by the left that freedom of speech.</p>
<p>If you ever want to strike at the spiritual heart (such as it is) of the left, make some sort of feint at their sacred right to free speech. It&rsquo;s their core belief. It&rsquo;s at the root of their art, culture, society.</p>
<p>Except when it isn&rsquo;t, such as in cases like this. </p>
<p>Or in all the myriad of other cases where politically correct belief takes precedence over &#8220;incorrect&#8221; speech.</p>
<p>At any rate, good luck to the Sweden Democrats. The entire white world is cheering you on.</p>

<p>Indeed.  One highly critical Scandinavian observer, in fact, was cited by the U. S. Supreme in its Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954.  Quoting from University of Delaware Professor Raymond Wolter&rsquo;s RACE AND EDUCATION: 1954-2007 (2008):</p>
<p>&#8220;In so holding [that racial isolation impaired the confidence of black youths and depressed their ambitions], the BROWN Court placed its imprimatur on the social science of Swedish scholar Gunnar Myrdal, whose work the Court cited approvingly in a footnote.  In his classic book AMERICAN DILEMMA Myrdal ignored the strengths of African-American life and culture   &mdash;  - strengths that black leaders such as W. E. B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey, among others, had emphasized.  Instead, Myrdal maintained that white discrimination had so damaged blacks as to render their culture, values, and communities almost deranged. According to Myrdal, &#8216;in practically all its divergences [from the dominant white society] American Negro culture is &hellip; a distorted development, or a pathological condition.&rsquo; Segregation damaged blacks, and the extent of the damage was reflected in the way blacks lived. &#8216;The instability of the Negro family, the inadequacy of educational facilities for Negroes, the emotionalism of the Negro church &hellip; provincialism &hellip; high negro crime rate &hellip; and other characteristic traits are mainly forms of social pathology which, for the most part, are created by caste pressures.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In time Myrdal&rsquo;s views became something of a liberal orthodoxy.  To overcome the warping effects of discrimination and segregation, Myrdal and others called for both desegregation and integration. &#8216;We assume,&rsquo; Myrdal wrote, &#8216;that it is to the advantage of American Negroes as individuals and as a group to become assimilated into American culture, to acquire the traits held in esteem by the dominant white Americans.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As Myrdal saw it, white prejudice and discrimination had depressed the Negro&rsquo;s standards of living and morality, and whites then pointed to the low standards as justification for discrimination.  One way to break this cycle was to fashion desegregation so as to encourage equal status contact between whites and blacks. If whites interacted with blacks of similar status, they would discover a common humanity that transcended race.  If desegregation were structured properly, whites would discover that racial prejudice was irrational.&#8221; pp23-24    </p>

<p>Somehow, whenever the leftist governmedia find a non-multiculturalist speaking in public, they always manage to leave the impression that the speaker was addressing a tiny knot of crackpots, surrounded by legions of outraged, right-thinking  diversicrats.</p>
<p>I suspect that the numbers were far less unbalanced than this article would have us believe.</p>
<p>As for voting: unfortunately, in Sweden or here, most Whites will vote for whoever the governmedia tell them to.  How, then, do we get our message before the public, when the media are uniformly controlled by our enemies?<br/>

Liberals claim to favor &#8220;free expression.&#8221;  Nevertheless, those on the left have been intolerant of theories of genetic determinism at least since the the publication by Richard Herrnstein in September 1971 in the Atlantic of an article introducing the ideas that later on appeared in The Bell Curve.<br/>
 <br/>
There is as much diversity on the left as on the right.  It would be unfair to lump liberals together with those who harassed Professor Herrnstein, and tried to get him fired from Harvard.  Nevertheless, I have never read of liberals protesting the persecution of Herrnstein, E.O. Wilson - who wrote Sociobiology, the New Synthesis, and similar professors and scientists.  </p>

<p>Ah yes, the vuvezela. I hoped we&rsquo;d heard the last of that moronic contraption when the World Cup ended. This supremely annoying &#8220;musical instrument&#8221; is indeed an excellent example of African creativity: a horn that plays only ONE NOTE. </p>
<p>What brilliance! What ingenuity! Up, up, ye mighty race! </p>
<p>My late father liked to amuse small children by (IIRC) putting a plastic comb wrapped in waxed paper in his mouth, and blowing it like a kazoo. The sounds he produced had a much wider tonal range and were far more musically interesting than the vuvezela. </p>
<p>But then, dear old dad was merely a Straight White Male   &mdash;   so who cares, right?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not really in favor of a &ldquo;cradle to the grave&rdquo; system that Sweden and other Euros have. However, I wonder if those who say that a low birthrate portends an end to such a system are right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am completely for a system like Sweden&rsquo;s because I lived and worked in one like it for several years and saw how great it was for the people, who were of one basic ethnic group.  They were proud of their identity, and had no qualms about paying taxes for things like open health care for CITIZENS.  They had, until they joined the EU a tight border, as opposed to Sweden, and took no refugees.  When they attempted to let Gypsies into their schools and they started beating up on their own kids, they reversed it immediately.  I worked with a native orthopedic surgeon and saw how their system worked.  It wasn&rsquo;t defensive, so they did not waste money to fend off lawsuits, and they shared cases, meeting in the hospitals once a week in committee to review the major cases and make decisions based on a large consensus of expert opinion.  Everyone could access the care, and the country was like one big family, even though some were religious and some were not, and they had old pagan festivals as well.  I will not divulge the country here, because I do not want to be identified.  But I was a witness to the kind of white social state that could exist, if the will was there.  But if you or anyone else thinks that we can get that through the old &#8220;dog eat dog&#8221; method of economic and social development, you are badly mistaken.  The crime rates and history of crime in America from the bandito tradition to JP Morgan&rsquo;s type ought to inform that.</p>
<p>Low birth rates came about because in the 1950s some intelligent whites in Scandinavia did some simple math and realized that the world would collapse from overpopulation if responsible parenting did not begin.  They also showed that quality of lives, not the numbers was going to be more of a contribution to a society than simply numbers.  The Zero Population Movement used to show commercials all over the Western World including the U.S.  As recent as the early 1990s, there used to be commercials aired that encouraged something like 2.3 children per family.  </p>
<p>All this now seems to be lost, seemingly because both the state and industry has realized that numbers are needed to guarantee both a cheap work force and a predictable tax base.  China is considering ending its one child rule because it has realized that it will need more people to sustain and continue to grow economically.  A contracting population means a contracting economic base.  It also means smaller government.  No power base likes that idea.  But it has also insulting and non-PC to suggest that Hispanics for example, ought to have less children, because big families are part of their culture.  In Africa the drive continues to be &#8220;save the children.&#8221;  White philanthropists go to places like Belize to try to save the ecosystem and end up being burned out by the very people Christian Charity groups tell us on TV need our support for their unwanted children.</p>
<p>With an ever expanding population, one thing is guaranteed; public health issues will continue to loom, competition for dwindling resources will increase, and the likelihood of ecological collapse increases.  We are only a few years away from the oceans going acidic, never mind global warming.</p>
<p>The solutions to the challenges for the white race is not an isolated issue to be resolved through some fantasy race war, or even legislation.  These are complex problems that are intertwined and only people with superior perception and the intelligence to manage things will save us.  Reading the usual postings on Amren for six years hasn&rsquo;t convinced me that even whites are capable of this.  But I am convinced that once whites are reduced to an ineffective racial and political force, the hordes of over-breeding people will drag everyone into biological oblivion.  And the best scientific minds in the world such as Steven Hawking and the late Issac Asimov have long said this and illustrated its inevitability.<br/>

		<p>The Sweden Democrats today made a stunningly strong showing  at the polls today, gaining for itself 20 seats in Parliament  for the first time.  However, the other political parties are vowing to boycott any cooperation with them.</p>
<p>This &#8220;marks a historic moment as a non-socialist government was elected to a second term for the first time in the country&rsquo;s political history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweden has the most vigorous economy in Europe and, unlike the declining dollar and euro, one of the strongest currencies in the world. So, the real issue here is immigration, despite the reluctance of the major parties to discuss it.</p>
<p>But do notice the disdainful tone of the article, which only condescends to mention the Sweden Democrats at the very end:</p>
<p><i>The far-right Sweden Democrats&hellip; nearly doubled its votes this year. But its anti-immigration policies have caused all the main party leaders to vow not to cooperate with it, even as it won seats.   &#8220;I think it is more important than ever that everyone goes to vote today so that we can stop them,&#8221; one young woman voter said, referring to the Sweden Democrats. &#8220;I think it would be a day of shame for all Swedes if those people would come into parliament.&#8221; </i> http://tinyurl.com/2agt3hh</p>
<p>VDare also has an interesting article on the election.<br/>
<i>This is a huge achievement. Far from being a haven of tolerance, as the MSM like to suggest, Swedish civil society is an ugly monolith of Political Correctness, shored up by harsh restrictions on Free Speech. <b>The Sweden Democrats had their meetings shut down and their website wrecked. They were shut out of the election debates, and the Swedish media avoided them. </b><br/>
  <br/>
However, Sweden also has a disastrous colonization by Muslims in full swing&hellip; The sensible – and democratic - response would be for the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; alliance to negotiate immigration reform with the Sweden Democrats&hellip;<b>Given the Establishment hysteria in Sweden this evening,</b> however, more election cycles may be needed.</i><br/>

<p>That&rsquo;s a classic example of the triumph of brainwashing. Here&rsquo;s a woman voting against her own interests and against the survival of her own nation. A well-meaning woman convinced that she&rsquo;s &#8220;doing good&#8221; by importing the rest of the world.   How much more pathetic can you get?</p>
<p>The power of the media must be broken!</p>

		<p>Yes, we should work on the welfare system! Don&rsquo;t you think everyone have the right to free healthcare, rich or poor? Don&rsquo;t you think you have the right to sick pension (SSI aand SSDI) if you are ill? I do! Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s unfair that the eldery living in retirement homes get half meals and go hungry because counties have to svae funds to be able to support the unwilling to work 3rd world immigrants? The muslims hate us for being Swedes, they call our teen girls Swede-hores every day in school, they gang rape them for not wearing burqa or being muslim! tell me, is this right? Is it right when jews flee our country because of attacks from muslims who hate jews? I don&rsquo;t think so. I like the system we&rsquo;ve had where we take care of each other, nothong wrong with free health care!</p>

It&rsquo;s fine when you &#8220;take care of each other&#8221;.<br/>
But it becomes impossible when a small country of 9 million starts thinking it is responsible all the miserable people of the world.</p>
