<h1>Poor Countries Face Education Crisis, Report Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Staziuso, Cybercast News Service, September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report [released by the Global Campaign for Education]  &mdash;  &#8220;Back to School?&#8221;  &mdash;  said poor countries are &#8220;teetering on the brink of an education crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the five countries at the bottom of the list, four are in Africa, and three of those are in East Africa. The ranking rated Somalia, Eritrea, Haiti, Comoros and Ethiopia as the bottom five based on access to basic education, teacher-student ratio, and educational provisions for girls.</p>
<p>Even Kenya, considered successful compared to its East African neighbors, had to delay free education to 9.7 million children over the last year due to budgetary constraints, the report said.</p>
<p>The report was produced by Education International, Plan International, Oxfam, Save the Children and VSO.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The U.N. says the number of children not in school has dropped from 106 million in 1999 to 69 million in 2008.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has seen its classrooms fill over the last decade, though the continent still accounts for almost half of the total of unenrolled children. In 1999, 58 percent of African children were enrolled in primary school. By 2008 the figure was 76 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UNICEF said its research shows that spending $1 million helping children age 5 and younger in the most remote and disadvantaged areas would prevent 60 percent more deaths then the current approach, what it called &#8220;a stunningly higher return on investment.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Forget illiterate South Africans and Malis.  We have a major literacy, math, civics and science problem in our schools, including majority white suburban schools. Liberals have stripped curricula of basics and fundemental skills. Occupational education and physical education, primary skills for most students, are ignored in favor of the American myth that everyone is college material.  </p>
<p>The educators scream,&#8221;Children First&#8221;. The cry should be &#8220;national survival&#8221; first. The current education reform effort spurred by former Bush bureaucrats and Secretary Duncan who is Obama&rsquo;s education chief. Obama&rsquo;s proposals and giveaways to state depts of education will make things even worse. Their &#8220;Race to the Top&#8221; program is a Race to the Bottom. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if anyone in India can read. I do know that they can&rsquo;t pronounce English at all, despite decades of British rule and now taking over white collar jobs in the US.</p>

		<p>How is it that Americans managed to get by somehow in the 19th century at a pre-industrial level of development without &#8220;aid&#8221; from anybody? </p>
<p>If these Africans are so interested in educating their young, why not find a member of the community who is able to read, write, and do arithmetic, build a little school house, and have everyone in town chip in a small sum to pay him a sallary to teach? </p>

		<p>a classic example of throwing money down a rat hole.</p>
<p>or &#8216;good money after bad&rsquo;</p>
<p>or, &#8216;will we ever learn&rsquo;? and I&rsquo;m not talking about the africans&hellip;&hellip;.  will do-gooders ever understand that their doing good actually is bad?  for instance, massive health advances in africa, birth rate up, then here comes the famines with hoardes of africans unable, unwilling or unknowing how to feed themselves&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
there are many other examples of do-gooders causing more harm than good&hellip;.. Most are done by stupids whites with too much money and time on their hands. </p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip; Now, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;  Somalia, Eritrea, Haiti, Comoros and Ethiopia.  What could all those countries possibly have in common?  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;UNICEF said its research shows that spending $1 million helping children age 5 and younger in the most remote and disadvantaged areas would prevent 60 percent more deaths then the current approach, what it called &ldquo;a stunningly higher return on investment.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>A &#8220;stunningly high return?&#8221;  Black Africa has been propped up by the White man&rsquo;s money, technology and handouts for at nearly a century, now, with no end in sight.  When do those &#8220;stunningly high returns&#8221; start to roll in?  In any other field except the race-guilt game, such an &#8220;investment&#8221; would have been allowed to collapse long ago.<br>

		<p>This is next!  EVERY White nation will be forced to pay for universal education, health care, housing, food and you name it. What is wrong with our race? Can&rsquo;t they see what the agenda is and WHY? Can&rsquo;t they see their own demise as a race? Where are our leaders? Where are the Whites with money to buy up the media, TV, etc. to show the pro-White message and expose those with the agenda to destroy ALL White nations and people? </p>

		<p>I was reading the history of Indiana. Prior to the 1850s, education was very limited, poor at best. The same could be said most other states at the time. Yet these early Americans managed to organize courts, divide up land, enact laws, engage in trade and commerce, and generally build an organized society, all without an educated population</p>
<p>Throughout history other people have managed to create and organize society with little or no education for the masses.</p>
<p>So the lack of education in the 3rd world today should not be a hindrance to people creating a better life for themselves. The problem lies in the people. <br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, WHAT do these countries have in common with Detroit, chiCONGO, NOLA and D.C.?  PICK ME PICK ME! The only fair government response is to bring the total population of those countries into the U.S. To find out watch refugeeresettlementwatch.com totally disgusting information there/</p>

		<p>I go the other way.</p>
<p>Feed the adults.  Give the adults job, even if it&rsquo;s make work, they are an established resource and should have the most money thrown at them.</p>
<p>Do NOT &#8216;save the children&rsquo; because, in their utterly blameless and ignorant way, children imprint the behaviors that make them into functional or dysfunctional adults while themselves contributing next to nothing to the workaday existence of their societies.</p>
<p>The obvious thing here is that Africa needs constant water.  With constant water (massive desalinization plants on the coast) you can slaughter most of the massive herbivore herds, flood the rivers with chlorine and spray highly effective pesticides up and down the continent (including DDT if need be) to get the damn insects, snakes, gators, hippos, elephants, lions, leopards and all the rest of the predators and disease carriers out of the picture.</p>
<p>Then you plant the place with grasses that take the poison out of the ground.  Burn the grasses and replant with wheat, corn, and feed grass.  Before introducing 50 million head of free range cattle.</p>
<p>Then you turn these people loose with ATVs and a little farm-training supervision to herd, cull off the diseased and breed/brand/market drive their produce and livestock to FEED THEMSELVES with.</p>
<p>While providing a useful export.</p>
<p>Finally, you introduce a fixed, yearly, stipend income system which everyone can gain subsidy lifestyles from, IF they agree to be sterilized after their first child for two generations and their second child in the third.  This brings the population down without a bunch of starving kids showing up on TV.</p>
<p>Even if you have to bring in the Chinese to help actually run it (not that they don&rsquo;t already &#8216;own&rsquo; much of the best resource development over there), this is a way out for Africans.</p>
<p>It is also a dumping ground for those blacks who live here.  And are not wanted.  And would not stay, if we denied them benefits and gave them an alternative home that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The irony being that Blacks with more than a 1 mean standard deviation disparity with most middle class (85 vs. 100+) whites here, would be at equal -dominance- of IQ (85 vs. 70) over native black Africans.</p>
<p>In a land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but as much as I appreciate the primal beauty of Africa, it, like it&rsquo;s people, are a wasteland of unused and useless resources.  Better that Africa, the photo safari trip, die that America, the land of the whites, can raise itself back up.</p>
<p>This would be one way to do it.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem - none of those countries EVER HAD SCHOOLS of any kind.  There is no tradition of learning.  The people are still cow-herders, raiders and small-time subsistence farmers.</p>
<p>You need some kind of surplus production to support the infrastructure and resulting cultural climate to even envision schools.  Those people live in famine-prone deserts and barely keep themselves alive.</p>
<p>Uh oh!  Barry Obamago will ship billions over there now to increase test scores.  Race to the top - in Ethiopia!  </p>
<p>No worry, whites will be forced to pay for it.</p>
