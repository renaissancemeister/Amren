			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Jaschik, Inside Higher Ed, September 14, 2010v</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The overall scores on the SAT were unchanged for those who graduated from high school this year, with the critical reading average remaining at 501, the mathematics average going up by 1 point to 516 and the writing score dropping by 1 point to 492.</p>
<p>Scores in all three sections are down modestly from where they were a few years ago. The College Board continued its push, in releasing the scores Monday, to argue that the scores are a measure of academic rigor and that the SAT encourages college preparation. {snip}</p>
<p>But the figures released Monday also show a continuation  &mdash;  and in some cases a growth  &mdash;  of gaps by racial and ethnic group that are much larger than the one or two point shifts in the national averages. The College Board also announced Monday that its figures were counting more students than in the past who took the SAT later in the school year {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The more significant changes are evident when race and ethnicity are factored in. Asian-American test takers gained 13 points this year (across all three parts of the SAT), followed by Mexican Americans, who gained 7 points. Comparing scores over two years, Asian Americans gained 26 points, Mexican Americans gained 5 points, and all other groups lost ground (modestly). Asian Americans now outscore African Americans by 90 points on reading, 163 points on math, and 106 points on writing. Asian Americans score better than all other groups on all parts of the test  &mdash;  except that the white average exceeds the Asian American average on the reading portion. On that portion of the test, however, Asian Americans gained 3 points this year, while white scores were flat.</p>
<p>Another demographic trend that continued this year  &mdash;  as in all past years  &mdash;  was the apparent link between family income and SAT scores. {snip}</p>
<p>Another of the demographic indicators  &mdash;  all cited by those who criticize the role of the SAT  &mdash;  is parental education. The more education parents have, on average, the better a student&rsquo;s SAT scores. {snip}</p>

		<p>I take SAT scores after June 1994 with a grain of salt.  There have been at least two and maybe more &#8220;recenterings&#8221; since then.  The first &#8220;Recentering&#8221; meant that it was possible to get a perfect score on one part of the test (and the SAT as a whole) without having to answer every question correctly. </p>
<p>I took the SAT in June &#8216;94, the very last SAT before re-centering, and after the end of my junior year of high school.  The next January, I was messing around in my HS&rsquo;s guidance counselor/athletic director&rsquo;s office (small school), and he showed me a conversion chart for before-after recentering.  He showed me that my 780M/570V/1350C that I really got would have magically become 800M/640V/1440C if I would have waited to take the SAT until September.  I asked him point blank   &mdash;   Is this all to help the cause of college entrance?  Was I supposed to be a much less attractive prospect because I didn&rsquo;t have 90 artificial points on my SAT score?  He said no, because the college admissions boards were wise to the recentering.  So I asked him, why do it at all?  He had no answer, but I had an inkling of the real answer.</p>
<p>I took another look at the conversion chart, and there were a few instances where &#8220;recentering&#8221; meant lower scores based on a certain number of correct answers.  I didn&rsquo;t know it then, but I think now that that was done to reduce the score of white test takers in the neighborhood of the 75th percentile.</p>

		<p>So, how can this be? How can this same issue come up year in and year out for decades now, with endless handwringing, herculean efforts made to close the gaps, tests re-configured, results hyperanalyzed, and no expense spared to &#8220;uplift&#8221; the perpetually underpeforming - particularly, of course, blacks? How can literally NO improvement be made in DECADES of this laser-focus on the &#8220;achievement&#8221; gap? </p>

		<p>In other news, it was recently reported that Asian youth living in the USA continue to predominately have dark eyes and black hair.  Hence, the eye- and hair-color gap between Asians and people of European descent remains just as strong, as when it was first noted several hundreds of years ago.  </p>
<p>University professors and politicians are at a loss to explain why.  How can it possibly be that after living in the USA, for generations, that the pesky color-gap remains?  Some researchers claim that it is due to racism, others believe unequal opportunities or diet, poverty, profiling, bad schools, the legacy of colonialism, lack of busing, segregation, lack of pride, having  too few role models who look like them or, alternatively, having too many role models who DO look like them, or finally, the barriers that have kept Asian youth from fully participating in the benefits of American society. </p>
<p>In any event, the Federal government, and all State, County and city governments plan of spending Billions Dollars again this year to solve this problem and end the racial-color gap.   </p>

<p>Of course, what they WANT you to think is that rich people have better advantages, and the lower scores are because black parents are poor.  Just another way statistics can be skewed to mean anything you want, and analysis of statistics is emotionally biases.<br>
The FACT of the matter is that parents with higher education WORKED to obtain that education throughout schools, and taught that value to their children.  They kept on their kids to study and complete homework.  They punished their kids if they did not.  The reward is that upon graduation, higher income and better standards of living were achieved.  So OF COURSE kids of parents in higher income brackets who have higher education are going to do better.  EVEN WITHOUT FACTORING IN NATIVE INTELLIGENCE.  A student of relatively average intelligence can achieve 4.0 if he is willing to put out the work necessary to achieve that goal, and does not take his eyes off the mark.  But, if his eyes wander to hitting on every white girl in class, being cool, acting out in class, hanging with the buds and playing B ball, engaging in a little wilding here and there, and saving for his college education by robbing liquor stores and selling drugs&hellip;&hellip;well, he might not attain that 4.0.  Ya think?</p>

		<p>As someone who has prepared students of all ethnic backgrounds in the past decade for standardized  tests, including SAT, I can say most US public students regardless of race are unfit for university admission or education. Practically no blacks are, a few Hispanics are (and that term is nebulous, encompassing many racial and national groups) and the majorty of whites are also functionally illiterate regardless of what Bush&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s education bureaucrats say. </p>
<p>We need to restrict academic programs to the motivated and cultured. College is no place for rememdial education which should stop, forthwith. Some blacks, many Hispanics and many whites should be in vocational and basic English programs. Apprenticeships should be revived. Jobs sent to China and India must be recovered to employ the vast numbers of Americans, including white, who have no business studying business or anything else in our too-numerous and over-priced colleges. Cut down the number of misplaced college students.Cut down the number of colleges(end their federal aid and buying of unqualified students by scholarships largely funded by the public).</p>
<p>For those of you with college or high school kids out there,I say, tough! I hope your kid has a high IQ and is ambitious. Otherwise, pick up a drill or paint can.</p>

		<p>Black Africans are doing terrible.  However, white children are not fulfilling their academic potential and every white person should be concerned.  Black failure means education officials will try to hold white children back in order to close the white-black achievement gap because that&rsquo;s what they have always done.  Non-white people can&rsquo;t succeed unless white people are held back/ pacified.  In Great Britain, the British have succeeded in holding down white test scores so that East and South Asian can surpass white achievement by age 18 (white British students lead all other groups until the fourth grade) and significantly close the gap with black African students.  White British scores on their SAT-like test are lower now than 50 years ago.  Education officials in America are trying to replicate what the British have done here.  Too many white parents take a passive approach to their children&rsquo;s education.  Putting pressure on your children to succeed in school is a good thing (obviously over doing it can be bad) and preparing them for school work is worthwhile.  The reason Asians have gained a massive amount of points on the SATs in two years is because they prepare very hard for the SATs by using SAT guide books, going to SAT prep camps, SAT study groups etc.  Asians know so much about the test beforehand that when they take it they are much more relaxed and prepared than other students.  Too many white parents think their teenager can navigate school on their own.  Which means white children are going to come up with a lot of failure or never reach their potential because they don&rsquo;t have the guidance, experience and support to achieve their best.</p>

		<p>The results roughly reflect the findings of two Princeton sociologists who studied how race is weighed in the decisions of admissions officers at eight elite universities:</p>
<p>&#8220;The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I&rsquo;m not buying the Asian writing scores.  I know Asian engineers with PhD degrees who can barely write a sensible email.  Sure, they&rsquo;re tits with math, I&rsquo;d never try to deny that (even though it never got them to the moon).  But writing?  No way.  The article also seems to suggest that Hispanic scores are second in line to Asian, also laughable.  Hispanic kids made gains the black kids didn&rsquo;t and were percentage-wise second to the Asians.  But only in gains, not scores.  Like it or not, Hispanics are still only a notch above blacks on the the educational achievement ladder.  And as long as they keep thinking that all things anglo are evil, it won&rsquo;t change.  Which is fine with me since it means my children will have less competition than I had.  And that&rsquo;s the real payoff.  Hate white culture and methodology at your own risk, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt my feelings at all.  I know I&rsquo;ll be called a racist simply because I&rsquo;m white.  So what do I have to lose?<br>

		<p>Didactic   &mdash;   Post # 9: &#8220;We need to restrict academic programs to the motivated and cultured.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are 100% correct.  The idea that all American (and immigrant) youth should graduate from college is a Utopian fantasy.  Only about 30% of youth are intellectually capable, and half of those are too immature or unmotivated to complete college.  College should be for those who have the ability and the drive. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with working with your hands, and there is honor and fulfillment in doing any job, if you do it correctly.  </p>
<p> Our nation needs to stop out-sourcing jobs and importing wage slaves.  We need to return to a time when OUR factories produced the goods we consume, and when OUR factories employed Americans at fair wages.</p>
<p>There must be opportunities and good jobs for those 70% of Americans who are not academically inclined.  It is impossible to have those opportunities, when we continue to import 2 million new workers each year and also send our production to China and India.     </p>

		<p>Many Asian qualities make them perfect test takers.<br>
Organized preparation, memorization, group pressure..all<br>
lend to high performance in a regimented environment where<br>
the future is a known and where creative, impromptu response<br>
has no value.<br>
But all of this fails in a creative environment where<br>
the future is unknown, and experience is not &#8220;structured&#8221;.<br>
This is where Asians fail abysmally. Asians will go absolutely<br>
wooden when things dont go according to plan. They will<br>
look for the instruction book..when there is none. They will avoid the new and unknown and they will punish anyone that<br>
breaks the mold of accepted behaviour. These are mental habits<br>
that make for great test takers, and organization men..but <br>
 Western Civilization is the birthplace of all <br>
real creativity and new ideas.</p>

		<p>Get your kids OUT of public schools.  Get into a community system/family schooling approach which keeps students together in small groups that are more socially stable and race reflective of their capabilities.</p>
<p>DO NOT PAY for minority &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in your child&rsquo;s education.  You want them them comfortable enough to compete.</p>
<p>PAY to bring in a competent teacher to provide good education.  Get them right out of school and sweeten the deal with housing if you have the space to do so.  You do not know how many teachers _want_ to be part of a success story.  Will work hard to be relevant to your child&rsquo;s life.  And would really prefer that not to be in the miasma of public schooling.</p>
<p>Feed them with produce from your own garden.  Limit their intake of fluoridated water.  Limit their intake of sugar and caffeine.  Limit their intake of high fat saturated foods.  Limit their intakes of fish, especially early in life.  Check into their vaccination regimes, especially multi-load (anti-gen saturated) single-shot antivirals.</p>
<p>Make damn sure your kids don&rsquo;t get any 2-3 month breaks in the summer, during which their brains spiral back down to a low activity state that retards new neurosynaptic connection formation rate.  Keep them active (reading!) keep them learning on a constant-load basis so that they can gain grade levels on an assymetric basis with the rest of their age cohorts.</p>
<p>Take vacations to places that matter.  The Smithsonian not Disney Land.</p>
<p>Start shaping their desires with greater in-depth experience in whatever grabs and holds their interests, early.  If they want to be a park ranger, get them the experience to decide if that&rsquo;s what they are really into.</p>
<p>Make sure, at some point, that this includes racial realities in terms of the kinds of people they will deal with in job-X.</p>
<p>Half of the ennui our people suffer from is inherent to the notion that their is no purpose or pride in what we have now and can provide forwards for another generation.  Changing that alone means everything.  Happiness is a sense of constancy as worth in what you do.  Not being dropped into a new role at 18 that defacto says: &#8220;Now you are an adult, everything changes and there is no freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Realize that while some students don&rsquo;t belong in college, it should not become a fad to say that you shouldn&rsquo;t try your best to be there.</p>
<p>Lastly, make damn sure they understand that there ARE inter and intra racial differences in IQ and they should pick their partners as carefully as they manage their own lives.  Because our race is a proud dynasty, not a random lottery.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;I take SAT scores after June 1994 with a grain of salt&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As well you should.<br>
 <br>
To expound on your post a bit, the original SAT was designed to measure g or inherent ability, hence the name Scholastic &#8216;Aptitude&rsquo; Test.  Charles Murray writes that his high scores on the SAT, the great leveler, allowed him, a boy from a small town in Iowa, admission to Harvard, a place previously reserved for the children of wealthy elites.</p>
<p>Of course, as the old SAT measured g or general intelligence, those with higher aptitude scored better:  Whites and Asians, leaving blacks and hispanics far behind. This became a problem in the 60s as the egalitarians &#8216;marched through the institutions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The PC overseers, with a 40-year, iron grip on the educational system, and refusing to admit that g exists, deemed the test &#8216;culturally biased&rsquo;, racist and charged that it favored Whites over blacks (by using such White, racist vocabulary words as &#8216;yacht.&rsquo;).</p>
<p>So, the test must be &#8216;re-centered&rsquo;, &#8216;re-normed&rsquo;, if not scrapped, to &#8216;close the SAT achievement gap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles Murray writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In 1993, the College Board abandoned aptitude altogether and changed the name of the SAT to &#8216;Scholastic Assessment Test.&rsquo; In 1994, it introduced major substantive changes to the SAT that were explicitly intended to link the test more closely to the curriculum.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s SAT has eliminated the highly g-loaded analogy items and added a writing component that carries with it a multitude of scoring problems&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet the achievement gap continues apace.  </p>
<p>What to do next?  Eliminate the SAT IIs, denigrate the SATs as &#8216;worthless&rsquo; and only viable as a &#8216;test that measures test-taking skills&rsquo;, claim it doesn&rsquo;t predict college success (when, in fact, it over-predicts college success, especially for blacks)  &mdash;  anything but admit racial IQ differences.</p>
<p>And yes, as you write, the SAT probably WAS &#8216;re-normed&rsquo; to lower White scores, the essay section explicitly added so non-Whites could relate their sob stories of oppression and hardship, which count as much, if not more, than the verbal and math sections these days in college admissions.</p>

		<p>Poster #14 is right.  I have known many, many orientals in my time and none of them, no not one of them, could write worth beans.  Oh they are technically correct in their sentences, but none of them wrote with any imagination whatsoever.  (When was the last time you saw more than one token asian writer on the NY Times bestseller list?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that Indians write much better than orientals, probably due to the ubiquitous british ed system that elevated the indians, whereas the chinese, japanese and koreans never had that, only a confucian-style of rote learning.</p>
<p>I do know there are some highly educated latinos who write well, but to be fair, they are almost all caucasian or majority so.  The more indian a latino is, the less successful they seem to be, and I know this from YEARS worth of teaching in latino areas.</p>
<p>Also, most white people these days are slipping, especially the ones who get too close to hip hop culture.</p>

		<p>I was especially glad to see Asian students&rsquo; scores compared to Bantu scores - what a yawning chasm of difference. This is true in all 50 states. I doubt the Asian students are on a free school lunch program, or were enrolled in Head Start programs. Didn&rsquo;t Lyndon Johnson tell us that these programs would correct the achievement gap, as part of his &#8220;Great Society&#8221; program?</p>
<p>The beauty part of all this is, diversity is put on display front and center - just not in the way diversity&rsquo;s lovers had intended. The test scores of the different races are indeed, diverse. It would be boring if everybody achieved perfect scores, wouldn&rsquo;t it?<br>
Equal opportunity does not mean equal results.</p>
