<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/sep/28/hideously-diverse-britain-equalities">Hideously Diverse Britain: What Bigots Say Behind Closed Doors</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hugh Muir, Guardian (London), September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You spot them pretty quickly, my friend Jerome Mack tells me. Put 15 people in a room and the chances are that there will be two of them. Thirteen will make the effort. The other two will be bigots and proud of it.</p>
<p>There are many derided jobs and Jerome does one of them. Try this for size. &#8220;Hi, I&rsquo;m an equalities trainer.&#8221; In a Con-Dem world, it won&rsquo;t cut the rug at parties. But, despite what you read about busybodies interfering with normal human relationships and curtailing freedom of speech, how everything would be all right if only the malcontents would stop creating the problems, Jerome says what he does is pretty necessary. &#8220;We work for private companies, the NHS, the police. We have worked for the army. You would not believe the things we hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all think we&rsquo;re basically good, even those who palpably aren&rsquo;t. And we are all creatures of our conditioning. But sometimes, in a private room, and probably because an employer decrees it, someone gets to challenge our perceptions about what we do, what we say and why. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to like it. &#8220;The bigots will sit there for a while like simmering volcanoes,&#8221; he says. &#8220;&#8216;I don&rsquo;t know why I am here,&#8221; they complain. &#8220;Why are you making such a big deal about these people? We all have our crosses to bear. What about me?&#8221; Jerome and his team might conduct training for 10,000 people a year, but these are the ones who get angry. Depending on what newspapers are saying, all sorts of things make them angry. Right now travellers, gay people and eastern Europeans sit top of the list.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an upside, and it is the other 13, because there was a time when in that room, the bigotry of the two would be infectious. No one would stop them, quite a few would join in. &#8220;Things have changed,&#8221; Jerome tells me. &#8220;They challenge the bigotry now, they shake their heads, obviously disapproving. The 13 have been empowered, the two disempowered.&#8221;</p>
<p>So doesn&rsquo;t that put you out of a job, I ask him. &#8220;I&rsquo;d love to be out of a job,&#8221; he says. But it&rsquo;s a work in progress. The 13, they&rsquo;re great. But the two are always a menace. And they never quite go away.<br>

     Those challenges are what we in the profession call a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221;.  Make the challengers explain themselves.  We&rsquo;ve got the facts, the challenge is the opportunity to present them.  Be cool, be accurate, and be insistent.  And smile.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m certainly glad to hear that.  With Britain now officially a third world nation, the chances of that happening, immediately are pretty high.</p>
<p>So is the likelihood of being stabbed to death on your way home by the people those &#8220;bigots&#8221; are complaining about.</p>

		<p>A little about Jerome Mack&rsquo;s career:</p>
<p>In 1998 Mr Mack, a University of Nebraska graduate, was awarded the MBE (Member of the British Empire) in recognition of his work in the field of Race Relations in Britain, and in particular, his work in promoting positive police-community relations (he declared &#8220;one third of police officers are racist, despite racial awareness training&#8221;). </p>
<p>In 1989 his firm was selected by the Home Office to provide community and race relations training to all 43 Police Forces within England and Wales, a position which he held until 1999.</p>
<p>He is listed as the managing director, Equalities Associates Limited, a firm specialising in the delivery of training programmes &#8220;to bring equal opportunity policy objectives to fruition.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a black man in England with a state-authorized mandate behind his message, he can afford to wax arrogant about the &#8220;two out of fifteen&#8221;.<br>

<p>&#8220;Those challenges are what we in the profession call a &ldquo;teachable moment&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an example of the very bigotry that the article describes. By calling it a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221;, you have already assumed in your own mind that you are the one teaching, while others are here to learn from you, or in other words that you are not interested in learning from them, and possibly changing your views. Anyone who thinks in such a way is bringing to the discussion not an open mind, but a mind already determined that its view must be the correct view. This is precisely what bigotry is. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to be out of a job,&rdquo; says Jerome Mack.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt it. Selling diversity snakeoil to captive audiences is the only job he knows, and he&rsquo;s been doing it for over a decade.</p>
<p>Back in 1999, as a Home Office employee responsible for training Metropolitan police, he told the BBC news, &#8220;that one third of police officers are racist, despite racial awareness training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that of every 10 officers that have come in for training, seven of them will accept it and three of them will walk out sceptical,&#8221; said Mack (interviewed by BBC news, January 1999).</p>
<p>He keeps recycling the same unscientific observation to justify his continued tenure as a paid diversity commissar.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Conditioning&#8221;. That&rsquo;s the answer! But HOW to condition people to make them love what they instinctively despise and rightfully fear?</p>
<p>LAWS! Speech laws. Hate crime laws. Work place laws. Public space laws. In other words, condition people with totalitarian fear in the guise of helping to the world a better place.</p>

		<p>Firstly, this is The Guardian we&rsquo;re talking about. A bastion of altruistic narcissism, staffed by cultural Marxists with a pathological aversion to the truth about what&rsquo;s happening in Britain&rsquo;s cities.<br>
  The appallingly self-righteous tone of the article surprises me not one bit. These are the people prepared to excuse immigrant crime/terrorism as merely collateral damage in the great project of obliterating Britain, &amp; replacing it with an enforced multicultural (no culture), simmering, atomised excuse for a country. A place, you can be sure, the Guardianistas live well away from.<br>
  The article omits to say why travellers &amp; eastern Europeans &#8216;sit top of the list&rsquo; of things that make &#8216;bigots&rsquo; angry. Travellers invade English villages &amp; make them hell for the inhabitants. Eastern Europeans are invading people&rsquo;s homes &amp; claiming &#8216;squatters&rsquo;rights&rsquo;, &amp; often driving the former occupants to near suicide. There are squatter camps by the river in Peterboro&rsquo;, where swans are being killed &amp; eaten with impunity. Only yesterday, a gang of eastern Europeans was charged with computer hacking millions from Brits bank accounts, &amp; so it goes on. And, am I a &#8216;bigot&rsquo; if I don&rsquo;t happen to believe &#8216;gay pride&rsquo; marches are the pinnacle of Western civilisation?<br>
  If only immigrants would squat a few Guardianista homes, &amp; give the arrogant smug fools a dose of their own nauseating medicine.</p>

<p>If Niemoller were alive today, he would be one of the loudest &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; demagogs on the planet. He was a ripe hypocrite who later became president of the vile World Council of Churches, a communist front. Too bad the Nazis didn&rsquo;t hang him along with the equally repugnant Nicholas Bonhoffer.

		<p>Perhaps the next person to go to one of Jerome Mack&rsquo;s courses should ask him to explain why there are so many areas in Britain with far higher than the national average of ethnic minorities in them. How did that situation come about, since Britain was 100% white in 1950? <br>
I&rsquo;ll tell you how it came about - MOST of the white people who used to live in those areas moved OUT as the immigrants moved in, and virtually NO white people moved into those areas as houses came up for sale - which means that more than 95% of the white population voted with their feet, to live among their own people&hellip;</p>
<p>And then you can ask Mr. Mack why he doesn&rsquo;t want to live in Africa&hellip;</p>

This reminds me of something I read about Stalin&rsquo;s Russia.</p>
<p>During meetings, Stalin would announce the name of traitors in the audience who were then taken away. Were any of them guilty of anything? Were their names randomly selected from a list?</p>
<p>Randomly select any two people from a crowd. Ask them questions that make them appear guilty of a crime and they become guilty simply by being subjected to questioning.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that. I said if you enter a discussion expecting to TEACH, you are close-minded. When you expect to TEACH, you do more than assume you know what you are talking about, you assume the other side knows less than you, and exclude the possibility that it knows more than you.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I take a challenge to my beliefs as an opportunity to argue for those beliefs, I&rsquo;m a bigot?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that either. There is a difference between arguing for your beliefs with potential readiness to be persuaded and arguing for your beliefs with your mind already made up. The latter is bigotry. The latter is what I accuse you of by your arrogant description of arguing as TEACHING.</p>

<p>They did not object to being in the criminal justice system.  They objected to black public defenders, probation officers, shrinks, and even to the blacks in the courthouse hallways attending their baby daddies trials.</p>
<p>Mr. Mack should talk to the gypsies befroe he defends their crimes.</p>

		<p>26 Anonymous: If I enter a discussion with an archeologist, on the subject of ancient Armenia, I expect to learn.  If we instead discuss my field of special expertise, I expect to teach.  If we discuss some other topic, about which I know something, we will exchange ideas, both of us taking turns as teacher and learner.  And if he proceeds to tell me things I know to be nonsense, I will correct him, taking care to explain just why he is in error.  <br>
     Tell me, what is the difference between &#8220;&hellip;assum(ing) that I know what I am talking about&#8221; and &#8220;&hellip;entering a discussion expecting to teach&#8221;?  How is the first one closed-mindedness and the other not?  <br>
     You have entered this discussion expecting to teach me the error of my ways, despite the fact that you know nothing at all about me, not my age, nationality, travels, education, experience, or personal interests.  I could be a retired professor of anthropology who&rsquo;s just earned a second PhD in genetics for all you know, and yet you call me closed-minded for presuming to teach.   You&rsquo;re a pretty dark pot to be calling this kettle black.  <br>
     Let&rsquo;s return to the original situation, what I called a teachable moment.  I am told to attend a meeting at work, to hear some fellow named Jerome Mack, an &#8220;equalities trainer&#8221;.  First of all, how does this guy presume to train me?  Pretty arrogant assumption, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?  Anyway, so Mr Mack says some things that I think are pure rubbish, and I call him on it.  Keep in mind that I am the the one who was called away from my useful labors, I did not seek him out to argue with him.  If I am forced to sit and listen to somebody who I have no reason to believe knows any more than I do, how am I arrogant for arguing with him?  I call this a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; not because I expect to enlighten the lecturer at the front of the room who, after all, is paid to bother us with his nonsense, but because it is educational to the others in the room to hear ideas openly discussed.  However, I have experienced these sorts of gatherings, and the &#8220;facilitators&#8221; or &#8220;trainers&#8221; or &#8220;moderators&#8221; react to reasoned opposition like vampires to wooden stakes.  They are unequipped to deal with articulate dissenters other than to thank us for our input and try to change the subject.  Their retreats are part of the lesson too.  The onlookers can tell who could and who could not defend their position.  <br>
     I don&rsquo;t suppose that you&rsquo;ve ever done any teaching?  Had you done so, you ought to have come across the &#8220;Socratic method&#8221;, teaching by arguing for and against different points of view.  It is a widely praised technique, though little used, because it is dangerous for the ignorant teacher to allow his pupils to question.  What you call arrogance is only the confidence of the intelligent and learned.  If the trainer can show me wrong, let him.  <br>
