<h1>Dad of 23 Gets Prison for Non-Support</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WOOD-TV (Grand Rapids), September 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A western Michigan man accused of fathering 23 children with 14 women and has been sent to prison for at least two years for failing to pay tens of thousands of dollars in child support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animals procreate. Human beings are supposed to nurture their children,&#8221; Kent County Circuit Judge Dennis Leiber said Thursday.</p>
<p>Howard Veal, 44, of Muskegon owes more than $533,000 in child support, according to the state attorney general&rsquo;s office. He pleaded guilty in July to owing more than $60,000 to a Grand Rapids woman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Veal questioned whether he actually has 23 children and said he pays what he can.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sherri Black, the mother of two of Veal&rsquo;s children, said she was pleased with the sentence but would prefer to get money. She has received only $87.75 over seven years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now my taxes will go to support him in prison,&#8221; Black said.</p>

		<p>Putting this man in jail is just an exercise in futility.  Now he can&rsquo;t work to pay off a debt (that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to pay off in 10 lifetimes anyway), and the taxpayers are taking care of HIM.  What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?<br>
Not that these fourteen woman don&rsquo;t shoulder some blame here &hellip; idiots.</p>

		<p>He could never support all those children.  Applying the law literally, he&rsquo;ll be in prison for the rest of his life.  At which point, he&rsquo;ll be useless to all those children, even though he wasn&rsquo;t very useful to them to begin with.  And some real thug won&rsquo;t be sent to prison because he&rsquo;s filling up a space.</p>

		<p>A more compelling case for birth control cannot be imagined.  Radical pro-natalists, especially the hyper-religious ones, inevitably get queasy over cases like these because it tests their &#8220;more is better&#8221; philosophy.  Good.  Let&rsquo;s hope the reckless behavior of Mr. Veal Cutlet tests it even more. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it must be like for one of his kids. Is it embarrassing to know that your father is in jail for having 23 kids and not supporting them? How would you feel about yourself knowing you are just one of 23 unwanted and uncared for spawn of a degenerate loser? Or is this kind of thing now just so common in the Black community that no one cares anymore? What a sad existence that I wouldn&rsquo;t wish on any child. </p>

		<p> Veal is just carrying on an &#8220;old racial tradition&#8221;   &mdash;   to paraphrase Hank Williams Jr. That is, sub-Saharan blacks in Africa have a tendency to impregnate as many women as possible, while making few if any efforts to support or raise the progeny that result. Their motto seems to be: &#8220;Chat &#8216;em up; knock &#8216;em up; hat on up; and leave.&#8221;</p>
<p> That irresponsible attitude seems to be a family legacy, so to speak, that Veal is more than happy to practice. At least in prison, he (presumably) can&rsquo;t father any more children for the public to support. And, by the way, I wonder if Sherri Black really does pay any taxes that will help to pay for her paramour&rsquo;s stay in the slammer? Or was she just speaking figuratively?</p>

		<p>I personally think that he needs to have a vasectomy rather than go to jail. He obviously will not be able to support his children.I am quite sure that the taxpayers are supporting the moms and kids anyway. I also think that the mothers need some form of birth control. But for some, this goes against their beliefs.</p>

		<p> A few years ago I read about groups of young black men that formed loose organizations known as &#8220;the 20/20/20 club&#8221;. Their goal was to father 20 children by the age of 20 with 20 different women. <br>
 These women reportedly named well known politicians as the father of the children which resulted in non belief by welfare officials and instant benefits for the kids.<br>
 The women went along with this scheme out of a sense of loyalty to the black race ( the more children that blacks have the greater their numbers and hence the greater their power).<br>
 It looks like some parts of the scheme may have backfired.</p>

<p>Dear Peter K,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re making the common White error of assuming blacks think like we do.  You or any other respectable white would be hurt and humiliated to be his child.  </p>
<p>But, in the black community, he&rsquo;s a famous local celebrity.  He&rsquo;s a &#8220;playa&#8221; who&rsquo;s &#8220;got game&#8221;, AKA: he&rsquo;s a stud and a social winner. </p>
<p>None of the other kids have fathers around who support them anyway, so why not enjoy having the famous Ladies Man as your biological sire?  Rather than being embarrassed by him, most of his children will probably enjoy a status boost from their ghetto-famous father.  Plus they have tons of siblings to back them up in turf fights.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some painful time around blacks from SE Washington DC and I can confirm they think of men as sources of amusement and gossip, but not support (parental or financial).  They are VERY casual about &#8220;baby daddies&#8221;.  Women raise the children, usually with help from Aunts and Grandmas. </p>

I&rsquo;ve read editorials of people demonizing the Duggar family for having 20 kids (who they support without public assistance in a stable, monogamous relationship).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read or seen a MSM piece which has condemns people like Mr. Veal. I have read and seen MSM reports that advocate more funding to &#8216;single parent families&rsquo;. <br>

		<p>OK, so the state of Michigan locks this man up since he can&rsquo;t pay child support. Wow, 23 kids by 14 women; he certainly got around. It seems like a win-win situation for Mr. Veal unless he were to be put into a forced labor camp and child support paid out from the proceeds. Would this have happened if welfare meant 12 hours a day shoveling coal or some equally unpleasant job? Especially for the women who had multiple children by this man. </p>
<p>Is it just me or is there something rather funny about the call letters of the station reporting this story. A very subtle double entendre. </p>

		<p>I hate to say this but in a way, -in a Darwinian sense- he has won. He now has almost two dozen offspring carrying his genes into the future, while the cuckolded White population endures all the burden of caring for them through taxation. Imagine the White population reproducing on a massive scale while the black population was stuck paying all the costs for it? </p>

		<p>As long as these women are treated as struggling heroines, this will continue. The tax-payer is the hero. These women should be treated as public nuisances, and in exchange for subsidizing their spawn, put in work camps not Section 8 housing. They should lose the franchise for the same reason children and criminals: they&rsquo;ve proven they can&rsquo;t conduct their affairs in an adult, responsible way. Any government that robs Peter to pay Paul, can always count on Paul&rsquo;s votes. That linkage must be broken. </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;Animals procreate. Human beings are supposed to nurture their children,&rdquo; Kent County Circuit Judge Dennis Leiber said Thursday.</i></p>
<p>Well, we know which category Howard Veal belongs to.</p>
<p>Our child support laws were written with white norms in mind.  They can be onerous enough for a divorced white man; they create an impossible obligation for the average ghetto sperm donor.  In Africa polygamy is common and men do little to support their children.  Their mothers work the fields and provide the necessities of life to their children.  Welfare has made it possible for the African style of procreation to be replicated throughout America in black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for the man&rsquo;s children but not for their mothers.  The women knew, or should have known, exactly what they were getting into.  (I am certain that none of them did anything so old fashioned as to insist upon being married before having sex with Veal.)  I feel especially sorry for the taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Guy is absolutely innocent.  No wait, hear me out.</p>
<p>This kind of case has been test-ballooned before and sooner or later we will find a sensible judge who will hear the argument, logically, and set the proper precedent.</p>
<p>Guy-Y has sex with Girl-X.  Impregnates her.  Didn&rsquo;t want to.  Was told she was &#8216;safe&rsquo;.  Now faces paternity issues which he has no option of avoiding if _she_ doesn&rsquo;t want to.  And why should she, if she can hook him for child support and the State for welfare?  That child is a paycheck.</p>
<p>Does she want &#8216;a life&rsquo; of her own if she is having unprotected sex with a man like him?  No.  Clearly not.  Or she would have morning aftered, gone to the free abortion clinic or demanded a condom if not a ring.</p>
<p>There is no good answer here because obviously, &#8216;after 23 attempts&rsquo; (several of them, multiple times) he should have also realized that he is never going to find a decent woman who will -just- have sex with him and that he is thus fighting a common constant of female broodmare instinct and conniving greed that knows no limits or boundaries.  And with that certainty if becomes time to get snipped or buy a box of condoms.</p>
<p>But it still remains that if those kids weren&rsquo;t -wanted- for their economic gains there wouldn&rsquo;t be 23 of the children running around and only one side of the gender division in this crime profits from creating them.</p>
<p>Women have the controlling leverage here gents, they could save themselves if they wanted to.  Before or after.  And they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a judge has to adequately, honestly, without &#8216;weaker sex&rsquo; false nobility, understand.  Before this all goes away.</p>
<p>If you want womens&rsquo; fertility abuse of the system to stop, you have to hit their babymaker welfare the same way you would a Mexican having children in a Texas or Arizona ER (with a statistical 2.8-3.2 kids per woman&hellip;albeit all under one roof, _once they reach the U.S._).  By removing it, completely.</p>
<p>And you have to, at the same time, pull from their greedy claws the notion of getting a man to support a child he may not have known he was creating as being also a legal option.  Because the &#8216;get real&rsquo; option, when you IMMEDIATELY admit what happened, is an abortion.</p>
<p>Those two efforts are all and the only things which will keep our LMI R-breeder population under some kind of control.</p>
<p>Marriage is sacred because it is jointly a K-breeder promise to have and support a family.  If this guy is not a bigamist, you cannot assign him more guilt than those who could have been on the pill or taken one.  Each time, they knew what their likely cyclical state of fecundity was, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>All go to jail or none do.</p>
<p>10 will get you 20, this woman is angry because she didn&rsquo;t know that her honey was making babies with all those -other- women.  Not because she was really angry &#8216;the second time it happened&rsquo; with herself.</p>

		<p>Those who&rsquo;ve said that he shouldn&rsquo;t have been jailed for this are looking at it the wrong way.  He&rsquo;s obviously worse than useless to his children no matter where he is.  Involuntary sterilization being, regrettably in this case, illegal, locking him up is the ONLY way to stop him from spawning more. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that he managed to find so many women who were willing to have children with him. Although it&rsquo;s quite probable that when he met new women, he didn&rsquo;t tell them about all of the children whom he&rsquo;d already fathered.</p>

		<p>#7 Crystal beat me to it. They should offer the guy a choice of prison or vasectomy and garnish his wages. With 23 kids there won&rsquo;t be much money to go around but its better than nothing. And at least he isn&rsquo;t costing taxpayers money. Last but not least, one shouldn&rsquo;t feel sorry for these women - especially the ones who had MULTIPLE kids by him. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.</p>

<p>Some libertarians might disagree with me or even say it&rsquo;s a &#8216;slippey slope&rsquo;, but some basic information should be available to the public on eveyone. Perhaps only previous marriages should be listed (or even the stated reason for divorce). Numer of children? Perhaps even income or criminal information or previous names, etc. AIDS or STD status. There was an instance on TV just the other day about a woman marrying 14 different guys and taking their money - even being married to more than one guy at the same time.</p>

<p>Yes. Sterilize all the &#8220;women&#8221; also. They only want a welfare check. They are promiscuous in the first place and nothing EVER happens to them! They get a check for life, never going to prison, etc. Most women on welfare have baby after baby by DIFFERENT men! Shouldn&rsquo;t they also be prosecuted? They raise nothing but future gang members and criminals. </p>
<p>Child Support is just another phony big government program to ensure that mainly Whitey pays and pays. They mostly go after the White man.  The welfare programs were set up to reward the single &#8220;mothers&#8221; and punish the father. Just look at the CPS and all the kids taken from their &#8220;mothers&#8221; because they are drug users, prostitutes, child abusers, etc.</p>

		<p>Among various animal species, when females need the help of a male to raise their young, monogamy is the rule.  This is true for some mammals and most birds.  Eggs and chicks need to be constantly tended and guarded.  <br>
 <br>
When females do not need males, males fight for sexual access to the females.  Those who win the fights impregnate several females; those who lose impregnate none.  When monogamy is the rule, there is little point in fighting over a female, because another one will come along shortly.<br>
 <br>
For reasons I have not been able to learn, among wild chickens hens can raise their chicks without the help of roosters.  Even in farm yards roosters are known for their belligerence.  <br>
 <br>
Consider the practice of cock fighting.  One would think male eagles would engage in more interesting fights than male chickens.  Nevertheless, eagles are monogamous, so the males do not fight.  <br>
 <br>
Aid to Families With Dependent Children makes it possible for an inner city female to raise children without the help of a man.  This does not only contribute to illegitimacy, it contributes to homicide.  The males are fighting over the females.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big news here? This guy had 23 children with 14 different women. That&rsquo;s black behavior. That&rsquo;s what they do. Ex- NBA player Calvin Murphy fathered 13 children by 9 different women. That fact came out at his trial for child abuse, a few years ago. Ex-NBA player Robert Parish had multiple child support suits against him. He never even contested the majority of these, and just paid up. Socioeconomic status has absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 17 has hit the nail on the head. Coincedentally so has Ann Coulter. Prior to the courts getting involved a woman had no claim to a mans assets or support for a child unless the couple was either married or in commonlaw household. This was part of society&rsquo;s way of punishing an irresponsible woman. Adoption or an orpanage were options. Beyond that was a lifetime of shame and drudgery was the price of burdening society with a bastard. The flip side of the coin was that in the event the mother found a husband he could assume the role of father with thought of interference from the natural father and minimal involvement of the state.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Guy-Y has sex with Girl-X. Impregnates her. Didn&rsquo;t want to. Was told she was &lsquo;safe&rsquo;. Now faces paternity issues which he has no option of avoiding if _she_ doesn&rsquo;t want to. And why should she, if she can hook him for child support.And you have to, at the same time, pull from their greedy claws the notion of getting a man to support a child he may not have known he was creating as being also a legal option.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disagree. If a man sleeps with a woman, he knows that he could father a child possibly. If he does not wish to support a child, then he can avoid this by not sleeping around and keeping his pants on, getting a vasectomy, using a condom or waiting until he was married. Child support is not &#8220;hooking&#8221; someone, it is simply support for the child which had no say in what a man/woman chose to do and it is and should be a legal option regardless of whether he knew he was fathering a child or wanted the child or not. The fault here is 50/50 between the man and the woman.</p>

<p>In those days, this was because there was no way it could be known if the child was his, not to &#8220;punish&#8221; the woman. Also, if any should be &#8220;punished&#8221;, it should be equally the man/woman as it takes two to tango.  The bottom line is children have a right to be supported by their fathers. While these women abuse the system and this is wrong, these men are also every bit as greedy and selfish, only out for a good time sexually and are told they have a right to sleep around because hey, they&rsquo;re guys, and if they father a child well tough, they&rsquo;re not parting with their money to support it, the kid can starve for all they care. There should be strict limits to not allow abuse of the welfare system. However, the welfare system which is public and child support by the father are two different things.</p>

		<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the fault of both the man and these women. I don&rsquo;t agree with some on here who want to absolve men of their duty to support their kids. Wanted or not, it is BOTH parents that should be supporting the kid, not the state. He and men like him should be jailed and during the day made to work at some sort of community labor and the proceeds should go to pay child support. He should also be made to get a vasectomy. If more men had to do this and take responsibility for their actions, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so feckless with sex. The women on the other hand should also be made to use birth control or get a tubal ligation and must do community work in exchange for any welfare benefits or section 8 and told in no uncertain terms, any more kids and you don&rsquo;t get a welfare raise. This also should have been done before he got a chance to father 23 kids.</p>

I personally think that he needs to have a vasectomy rather than go to jail. He obviously will not be able to support his children.I am quite sure that the taxpayers are supporting the moms and kids anyway. I also think that the mothers need some form of birth control. But for some, this goes against their beliefs.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need a vasectomy.  That can be reversed. What he needs is  thermal castration. That&rsquo;s with a blowtorch instead of a knife. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Those two efforts are all and the only things which will keep our LMI R-breeder population under some kind of control&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ONLY thing that will work is the one Jared Taylor recommends:  A mandatory IUD or Implant as a condition of receiving welfare.</p>
<p>These women do not have the right to burden White taxpayers with their fecundity, to expect us to provide life-long support for their low-quality progeny, not to mention the crime said issue perpetuates against Whites and the attendant costs of imprisoning these fatherless males.</p>
<p>Remember:  Blacks have an inherent inability to look into the future and to plan accordingly  &mdash;   everything is in the here and now and revolves around immediate gratification.</p>
<p>Forced government-mandated birth control is The Only Method that works.  </p>

		<p>Once when we were white, welfare was to pay for families who were in a temporary tough patch.  Single mothers who had a husband walk out on them and needed to go back to school while living with their extended family.  Eventually they got hired, remarried and moved on with their lives.  Welfare to the black underclass is simply subsidising a situation that will not get better.  Most of these women are not intelligent enough, let alone educated, experienced, and groomed to hold anything but the most rudimentarty dead end jobs.  No matter what we give them, most will never be productive members of society.  </p>

		<p>*Sigh* I can understand a white person reading this and drawing conclusions about blacks. I&rsquo;m a straight black male, gainfully employed. I don&rsquo;t have any children, I&rsquo;ve never gotten anyone pregnant. This is a perfect example of why one person cannot represent their race. I&rsquo;m truly disgusted by this man with 23 children. Forget jail, I say castrate him or give him the Death Penalty. Judge people by their individual merit, regardless of their race&hellip;.because this man does not repsresent me. </p>

<p> I agree totally.  </p>
<p> The idea that a man must support his offspring is a cultural one.  The fact that women are burdened by children is a fact of nature.</p>
<p> Child-support laws are based on the cultural notion that women are the weaker sex, thus more innocent, and men should bear equal responsibility for the act of procreation.  Women these days and certainly black women these days are not more innocent than their male counterparts and nature has clearly designated that a woman has a greater vested interest in the sexual act. To argue any different is illogical. <br>
 <br>
 To those who subscribe to the idea that sex is a 50/50 deal and that responsibility should be distributed equally amongst both parties and support child support laws I give you this bit to think upon.  The laws encourage the very behavior you would like to see end, namely, licentious behavior and children born out of wedlock.  As someone above me pointed out these women make a living popping out children.  Also these laws were based on good intentions based upon our western, European, Christian cultural ideas where there was shame associated with being a mother of a bastard child, but like most good intentions it has lead us onto the highway to Hell (HOV lane), because there is no such legacy of shame in sub-Saharan African culture.  It is in Africa where a few alpha-males do little, drink a lot, and procreate with many women while the women do most of the field work (Our president&rsquo;s father anyone???).   </p>
<p>Any women who has a child as an adult and outside of wedlock should be told, &#8220;wow, that sucks!&#8221;  &#8220;Bet you regret that decision.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The quaint notion of Husband, Wife, and children came about because these harsh standards were applied to mothers of bastard children and not vice-versa. By removing the financial risk associated with raising children one is simply encouraging this behavior.  To me the pregnant adult women (when seen as an affliction, in which light it is usually portrayed) is no different from the adult cigarette smoker who has lung cancer, the adult alcoholic with cirrhosis, or adults who dive into shallow pools.   You engaged in a risky behavior and got burned.  </p>
<p>  If this idea even worked in theory, which it doesn&rsquo;t, it would never survive in practice.  Don&rsquo;t believe me then I encourage to reread the article.</p>
