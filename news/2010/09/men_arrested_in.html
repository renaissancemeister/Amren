<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-11396980">Men Arrested in Gateshead Over Suspected Koran Burning</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six Tyneside men have been arrested after filming themselves apparently burning copies of the Koran on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Police said the men, all from the Gateshead area, were detained after a video appeared on the internet.</p>
<p>They were arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and released on bail pending further inquiries.</p>
<p>Plans by a US preacher to burn copies of the Koran on 11 September resulted in widespread condemnation.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Mutual respect&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>In a joint statement, Northumbria Police and Gateshead Council said: &#8220;The kind of behaviour displayed in this video is not representative of our community as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our community is one of mutual respect and we continue to work together with community leaders, residents and people of all faiths and beliefs to maintain good community relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two men were arrested on 15 September and a further four on 22 September.</p>
<p>In the video a group of men are seen pouring fuel over what appear to be copies of the Koran and setting light to them.</p>
<p>Plans by a US preacher Terry Jones to burn copies of the Koran, sparked worldwide protests and brought condemnation from American president Barack Obama.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Koran burning is a positive for our cause.  We should respect other cultures, ethnic groups, religions, and races - while at the same time remaining steadfast in our belief that we do not want to be displaced by them.  </p>

Sharia, Hiraj cannot be separated from Islam. Learn that<br>
there is NO moderate Islam. Then after learning all this<br>
take the Koran and THROW it a the next media simpleton that<br>

		<p>No Charles, there needs to be a pan-European burn a Koran celebration to cause the Muslims to riot and force the government to get out of the way while the people kick them out and send them back to the Middle east.</p>

Angry Muslim youths set fire to a church filled with worshipers, starting a riot that killed at least 27 people and wounded more than 300 in Jos, in northern Nigeria, officials said Monday. Sani Mudi, a spokesman for the local imam, said 22 people died in fighting between Christians and Muslims after rioters set fire to a Catholic church on Sunday. Five others died Monday from their wounds. More than 300 people were killed in inter-religious violence in Jos in 2008.<br>

A court in Kuala Lumpur today sentenced two Muslims to five years in prison for burning a church earlier this year. Brothers Raja Muhammad Faizal Raja Ibrahim, 25, and Raja Muhammad Idzham, 23, were convicted for burning the Metro Tabernacle Church in Kuala Lumpur on the night of Jan. 7.  Judge Komathy Suppiah described their act of setting ablaze &ldquo;a house of God&rdquo; as appalling and despicable, local media reported. She found their argument that their injuries were sustained in a late-night barbecue to be full of inconsistencies and contradictions. The duo, the older a dispatch rider and the younger a bank clerk, were arrested when they sought treatment for burn injuries.<br>
A stay of execution has been allowed pending appeal. A third suspect, Azuwan Shah Ahmad, was earlier aquitted for lack of evidence. Metro Tabernacle Church was the first of more than a dozen worship places, mostly churches, to experience arson attacks or vandalism early this year amid a heated dispute over Christians using the word &ldquo;Allah&rdquo; for God. The evangelical church was the most seriously damaged of all, though no one was injured in any of the attacks. On the same night, the Catholics&rsquo; Assumption Church in Petaling Jaya, outside the capital, had a molotov cocktail thrown into its compound. Assumption parish priest Father Phillips Muthu told ucanews.com police investigations are still continuing. He said such attacks are very serious because the intention was to provoke interreligious conflict. Whether those places of worship sustained damage or not, the attacks could well have sparked inter-communal conflict, he added. Fights between Hindus and Muslims had occurred about 10 years ago within his parish territory, he recalled. The priest said that while the police consider the Metro Tabernacle Church case as solved, many people believe the two convicted were hired to burn the church and the real perpetrators have yet to be identified.</p>

		<p>They owned the copy of the Koran that they burned, what has it got to do with anybody else? What if it just LOOKED like the Koran, but was full of pages of some random arabic text? Would it be a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; to make muslims THINK that a Koran had been burned? 1984 anyone?</p>
<p>Since when did muslims take over MY country and decide the laws I have to live by? The presence of four or five MILLION of these people in MY country is far more &#8216;offensive&rsquo; to me and the 50 million other indigenous British, than some bits of paper being burnt.</p>
