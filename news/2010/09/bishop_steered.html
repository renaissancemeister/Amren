<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/41953.html">Bishop Steered Scholarships to Family</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bresnahan, Politico, September 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) awarded three scholarships from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation to his stepdaughter and wife&rsquo;s niece between 2003 and 2005, according to records from the nonprofit group.</p>
<p>Bishop is the second Democrat found to have funneled CBC Foundation scholarship funds to relatives, threatening to turn the program into a larger political problem for the party. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) recently paid back $31,000 to the foundation for scholarships that she improperly awarded to various relatives and children of a top staffer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2003, Emmaundia Whitaker, the niece of Vivian Creighton Bishop, who is Bishop&rsquo;s wife, was awarded an education scholarship. She was also given a similar award in 2005.</p>
<p>And in 2003, Aayesha Owens Reese, the congressman&rsquo;s stepdaughter, was granted an education scholarship as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Bishop spokesman insisted the Georgia Democrat did not violate CBC Foundation rules that were in place at that time by awarding scholarships to family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our understanding that the CBC Foundation in 2008 revisited the guidelines and processes for its scholarship programs, and as such, included language to clarify that CBC family members are not eligible to receive the scholarships,&#8221; said Ashton McRae, Bishop&rsquo;s spokesman, in a statement released by the office. &#8220;These scholarships .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were awarded prior to 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2008, scholarship applicants have been required to formally certify &#8220;that they are not a family member of any member of [the] CBC, CBCF staff or its Board of Directors, corporate advisory board or any CBCF sponsoring entity,&#8221; Cooper added.</p>
<p>It is unclear how much the CBC Foundation scholarships were worth, but they typically run in the $1,000 to $2,000 range, according to media reports. Each CBC member is giving $10,000 annually to dole out to scholarship applicants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bishop is the second prominent CBC member found to have steered CBC Foundation scholarships to family members or relatives of top aides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bishop was also caught up in a scandal in 2009 when the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began a probe into whether a youth program operated by Muscogee County Marshal&rsquo;s Office improperly spent federal funds after it hired Bishop&rsquo;s stepdaughter and her husband. Bishop had earmarked more than $190,000 for that youth program.</p>
<p>Reese and her husband, Stephen, were paid more than $14,000 by that program, although they lived in the Atlanta area, more than 100 miles from Columbus, where the program operated.</p>
<p>The GBI later ruled that the hiring of the pair was legal.<br>

		<p>We have laws against just about everything in this country. There are places where you are not allowed to smoke cigarettes in your own back yard. There are other places which prohibit residents from owning a pickup truck.<br>
So how is it that this congressman is not in violation of a criminal code? I know there are laws against theft by misrepresentation and theft by misappropriation that read as though the authors had a picture of Bishop sitting in front of them.<br>
This guy doesn&rsquo;t need to be reprimanded or censured, he needs to go to jail. Rep. Johnson needs to go with him. If we make jailing corrupt politicians our top priority in America, the rest of our problems will just go away.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care what black pols do with the millions of bucks in a foundation designed to help blacks. Since black education is a oxymoron, what difference does it make who gets the &#8220;scholarship&#8221;?</p>
<p>Foundations as a tax dodge in general are a racket. Some small local foundations do fine work. But why should taxpayers subsidize someone else&rsquo;s point of view? To me, what Gates&rsquo; multi-billion dollar foundation is doing to waste money in Africa and to destroy traditional education in America is far worse than the dopey Black Caucus Foundation.   </p>

		<p>I attended both my nieces graduations. They had &#8220;special&#8221; awards for everything. Every time a black teacher or faculty member gave an award it was ALWAYS to a black student. ZERO exceptions. This was not at all the case with Whites.</p>

		<p>According to the article, &#8221; Each CBC member is giving $10,000 annually to dole out to scholarship applicants.&#8221;  So apparently some Black Congressional Caucus members are ripping off other Black Congressional Congress members.  I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>

		<p>It is telling that Bishop&rsquo;s spokesman excused such behavior by claiming it was legal at the time.  Their mentality seems to be that if it is legal, it is also ethical.  This is a good example of the lower moral standards that America has been subject to.</p>

		<p>Whatever Bishop did or didn&rsquo;t do, it seems to have primarily affected the CBC foundation, and the people who voluntarily donated to it. As far as I know, the foundation doesn&rsquo;t receive government funding, so I don&rsquo;t see it as any particular concern of people outside the foundation and the CBC. That said, if anyone has information indicating that the foundation does receive government funds, I would be more than happy to look at it.</p>

		<p>3- Every time a black teacher or faculty member gave an award it was ALWAYS to a black student. ZERO exceptions. This was not at all the case with Whites.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the blacks are stronger than White Humanity.  We are loving, compassionate, and fair minded, much to our detriment.  Blacks look out for themselves when choosing between them and us. We need to do the same- White Humanity&rsquo;s efforts should only be directed toward helping and uplifting White Humanity.</p>
<p>Let Jesus take care of the blacks. He&rsquo;s a deity and powerful enough to overcome the suffering that comes along with trying to solve their problems.  We are human and have natural limitations.<br>
