			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Victoria Kim, Los Angeles Times, September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that black officers were promoted over whites despite receiving lower scores on promotional exams and that white officers were disciplined more harshly for misconduct compared with black officers facing similar accusations.</p>
<p>Even serious misconduct by black officers, such as repeated domestic violence arrests, criminal investigations for burglary or smuggling steroids resulted in little or no discipline, the suit alleged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Edward Corrington, Arthur Juliano and Jeff Shelton alleged that the environment at the department was &#8220;racially charged&#8221; and &#8220;permeated with discrimination.&#8221; Specialized units including the K-9 unit were dominated by black officers, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>The suit contends that the environment began at the academy and that the department&rsquo;s recruiting arm was also predominantly black.</p>
<p>&#8220;In maintaining a virtually all-black division responsible for recruitment, background investigations and training, the department ignores the fact that Los Angeles has a population less than 10% black and an airport in which less than 5% of the passengers are black,&#8221; the officers&rsquo; attorney, Michael McGill, wrote in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that former airport security Chief James Butts Jr. requested a list of officers with their ethnicities after a 2007 test for sergeant promotions and &#8220;manipulated&#8221; the rankings so that more black officers would be promoted.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s pray to the God of White Humanity that this case will finally give the Supreme Court that &#8220;evil day&#8221; we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-1428.ZC.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-1428.ZC.html</a></p>
<p> Justice Scalia, concurring.</p>
<p>    I join the Court&rsquo;s opinion in full, but write separately to observe that its resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day on which the Court will have to confront the question: Whether, or to what extent, are the disparate-impact provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 consistent with the Constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of equal protection? The question is not an easy one.<br>

		<p>This taking place at LAX comes as no surprise.  I&rsquo;ve passed through there a few times in the last three years, and that entire airport has become a third-world toilet.  LAX will make you actually appreciate Detroit&rsquo;s airport. The LAX international terminal is a disgrace.</p>
<p>But, please keep this in mind: It is not just the protected-class quota-hires that drive me up the wall.  It is the whites barely out of their teens who got handed a pretty uniform and some police power. They are nasty and rude, and lord it over the passengers like they are lined up on the platform waiting for the next train to the relocation camps.</p>

		<p>Coming from a 30 year background in law enforcement, the facts stated in this story are just business as usual. </p>
<p>This kind of discrimination against whites is the norm, no matter what job you hold, private or public sector.</p>
<p>What needs to happen is to have a whole lot more of these kind of lawsuits filed. I know, it&rsquo;s easier said than done. But it is the only way to combat the rising tide of anti-white establishment that is washing over this nation. The nation, hell, the WORLD! And we need the media to report these kind of stories. But I&rsquo;m sure they fight the same kind of battle, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
