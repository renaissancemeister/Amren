	<p>Eight-week survey reveals one-in-three African Americans who are likely voters would vote for a Tea Party-supported candidate</p>
<p>EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Sept. 24 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  PJTV&rsquo;s Tea Party TV today unveiled the results of a special Tea Party poll, which revealed that about one-in-three (32%) African Americans who are likely voters would vote for a candidate supported by the Tea Party movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Questions of racism within the Tea Party have been raised for months now,&#8221; said Vik Rubenfeld, PJTV&rsquo;s Polling Director. &#8220;Our survey found that more than one-in-three African Americans support the movement. Moreover, the data revealed that 32 percent are also likely to vote for a congressional candidate whom the Tea Party supports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;PJTV&rsquo;s Tea Party poll shows that, for many black voters, race no longer serves as a rationale for supporting policies that undermine their economic interests,&#8221; said Joe Hicks, PJTV&rsquo;s host of the Minority Report and a former Executive Director for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. &#8220;Democrats and leftists have attempted to define the Tea Party movement as a collection of angry white bigots. However, the PJTV poll of black voters shows the wheels on the race card bus are beginning to fall off.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Poll Highlights</b></p>
<p>* 35 percent of likely voters who are African American support the Tea Party movement and 17 percent support the movement strongly.</p>
<p>* 38 percent of African American respondents who support the Tea Party endorse the movement privately. 34 percent publicly support the Tea Party.</p>
<p>* 32 percent of African American respondents are more likely to vote for a congressional candidate who is supported by the Tea Party, including 14 percent who are very likely.</p>

<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>PJTV has been conducting weekly Tea Party tracking polls of 1,000 likely voters since August 2, using Pulse Opinion Research. However, today they presented a special analysis spanning eight weeks from August 2 to September 19 which represents 543 likely voters who are African American. The margin of sampling error on this special survey is +/-4 percentage points with a 95 percent level of confidence.</p>

		<p>Not buying it.  Consider the polling source.  Pajamas Media is an aggregation of all sorts of lamestream conservative and neo-con type bloggers.  They&rsquo;re saying this not because it&rsquo;s true that a third of blacks like the TPM, but because they want it to be true.</p>

		<p>Bad news for the Tea Party.  If blacks feel comfortable around us, they&rsquo;ll show up more often, giving them the opportunity to spy on us.  We aren&rsquo;t raciss, we are race realists, which means we just don&rsquo;t want blacks around at all.  The Tea Party will fail, and the real Whites in it will form something that works- elemental instinct and obedience to the iron laws of nature- segregation!</p>

<p>They were never in place to begin with.  The Tea Party has been co-opted.  Welcome to Republican Party II.</p>
<p>There is still no party that represents the interests of White people.<br>

		<p>I have a profoundly difficult time believing this is true. Blacks, who shun the Republican party and vote better than 90% for the liberal/Democrat side, are suddenly on-board with the even MORE conservative/right-leaning Tea-Party movement ideologically? </p>
<p>Something clearly doesn&rsquo;t add up here.  </p>

		<p>I agree with Question Diversity.  I&rsquo;ve seen too many surveys and polls say things over the years that just don&rsquo;t match reality like overwhelming support for gay marriage even though the most liberal state in the nation California can&rsquo;t pass it with a voter referendum.  Why would blacks support the Tea Parties which advocate smaller government and less taxes when most of them receive some kind of government assistance whether it&rsquo;s welfare for the lower classes or cushy government jobs for the middle and upper classes?  Just more media hypnotism.</p>

		<p>Blaak Obongo is correct.  When the tea party begins worshipping and inviting the likes of Sarah Palin and Glen Beck, it&rsquo;s been co-opted by the republican party.   You know, the same Sarah Palin that STILL throws her support to McCain, and other neo-cons.<br>
Glen Beck the &#8220;christian&#8221; who worships MLK and says all faiths are equally valid.<br>

		<p>Handy Argument <br>
Common Sense: The Tea Party is not &#8220;racist&#8221;..right?<br>
Tea Party: Thats correct the Tea Party is open to everyone<br>
Common Sense: So if anyone can join why is it that the ones<br>
who choose to join are white?<br>
Tea Party: It doesnt have to be.<br>
Common Sense: But it is. Dont you think thats telling you something?<br>
Tea Party: Like What?<br>
Common Sense: Well the values of the Tea Party are traditional<br>
American values, the only ones that believe in that are white<br>
people..the people who come to your rallies<br>
Tea Party So?<br>
Common Sense..So when whites are no longer in control, the America you are trying to preserve will no longer exist.<br>
So how can your movement exist without some racial self awareness?<br>

 <br>
The word &#8220;conservative&#8221; can have different meanings.  A Gallup survey released October 26, 2009 indicated that 40 percent of Americans consider themselves to be conservatives, while only 20 percent consider themselves to be liberals.  Nevertheless, during that time Democrats outnumbered Republicans by roughly 50 to 40 percent.  <br>

 <br>
The Republican Party advances the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the country.  This is true even when most Americans lose ground economically as most did during the Bush administration.  Many Americans who are conservative on social issues - especially crime and punishment - vote Democrat because they know Republican economic policies will not benefit them, and they think Democrat economic policies might.  </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Blacks apparently not buying &ldquo;racism&rdquo; charge against Tea Party.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I have a rather different take on these polling data. I&rsquo;ll bet that Obama&rsquo;s political henchmen (e.g. David Axelrod) and/or the DNC picked up on the significant support for the Tea Party movement within the black population with their own internal polling some time ago and realized that they were losing the support of a vital constituency. Face it, if the Democrats lose more than a small fraction of the black vote they will be in really, really big trouble come November. </p>
<p>The response of the Democrats was to cynically play the race card in order to scare blacks away from the Tea Party. </p>
<p>In other words, the most enlightening thing about these polling data is not that the racism charge isn&rsquo;t working, it is that we now have a very good idea why the charge was made in the first place.  </p>

		<p>Polls should be taken with a grain of salt, especially polls that claim to be able to construe the political leanings of a large segment of population based on the responses of a random sampling of 543 people.</p>
<p>That being said, this does raise an interesting thing I&rsquo;ve observed about blacks.  They&rsquo;re far more conservative than they let on.  This doesn&rsquo;t translate into votes for the elephant, but when you consider large-scale black opposition to the advancement of gay issues, immigration, support of racial profiling of everyone but blacks, attendance of religious services on a percentage-of-population level that&rsquo;s likely larger than whites, and on and on, you see a curious disconnect between their personal beliefs and the votes they cast.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights legislation and Great Society programs were absolutely diabolical in that on the surface they wiped out &#8220;barriers&#8221; just as sure as they guaranteed perpetual underclass status for most blacks.  This was done by design.  Oppression simply went from overt to covert.  And now it&rsquo;s done with our tax dollars.  Blacks who were able left their communities to integrate with whites, stripping the black community of role models and ensuring they&rsquo;d never develop into any meaningful body.</p>
<p>Look at blacks and natives, probably the two lowest-performing groups in America, and what do you have?  The largest levels of government subsidy.  This is not a coincidence.  I think that most blacks understand deep down inside that big government is a big problem, but it&rsquo;s hard to say no to the gravy train, no matter what color you are.  You don&rsquo;t have to look very hard to find cradle-to-grave welfare whites either, and they&rsquo;ll never stop voting Democrat for the same reasons the blacks won&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Throw in the low cognitive abilities of many blacks and you have an impossible situation.  They just don&rsquo;t understand the political issues at a high enough level to make informed decisions.  This is why I make an exception to my usual libertarian leanings and am a big proponent of voting requirements, in much the same bent as Walter Williams.  Everyone should have one vote, but you should gain another for such things as taxes paid, property ownership, civic participation, cognitive ability, etc., therefore ensuring that it&rsquo;s the Americans who actually make the country click who decide the direction it takes.</p>
<p>My wife jokes that the greatest man-caused disaster of the 20th century was women&rsquo;s suffrage.  Look throughout history for examples where suffrage was expanded and you ALWAYS see a decline following.  Argentina went from one of the 10 wealthiest nations in the world to Peron in 30-40 years.  It&rsquo;s never been the same.  Pure democracy is the closest form of government to communism, and the result is largely the same, as we&rsquo;re seeing yet again.  Our fate is decided by the ignorant youth, lazy underclass, and hysterical women, with apologies to the very sharp ladies who post here often.  You know you don&rsquo;t fall in this group.</p>

		<p>AmRen is biased, anti-black.  That&rsquo;s not a bad thing but it bears admitting in something like this.  So the first question you have to ask is whether the votes are worth the strange allies discomfort.</p>
<p>The next question you have to put out there is not so much a interrogative as a mission statement: &#8220;What IS our platform?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a solid platform of very basic issues, you cannot pose the third question which is: &#8220;Are you in or not?&#8221;  Because money and votes = legitimacy as a function of breaking the bipolar (literally I&rsquo;m afraid) hypocrisy of the present, two party, system.</p>
<p>And if Blacks are wanted then we have to back off of &#8216;America as a white dominated population identity&rsquo; and at least -rephrase- the ideal as: &#8220;American for indigene cultures only.&#8221;  Which, at this point, includes blacks more than yesterday&rsquo;s immigrant hispanics because the Hispanics breed like rats and just keep coming.</p>
<p>I would then ask AmReners in particular: Do you want a third party whose base lies in the TP?  Do you want a TP presidential candidate?  If so, -when-?</p>
<p>It would be just too damn bad if &#8216;now would be pretty good&rsquo; happened as the water broke over the gunnels while our nation foundered and sank in a whirlpool of globalist mercantile economics.  Which is where this is all headed.</p>
<p>As bad as it sounds (with secession and rebirth as a racial state the only other option), these are the questions whites must ask themselves BEFORE inviting (as opposed to being saddled with, in 1865) the other racial minorities that could help our cause.</p>
<p>Because until we find answers for what we fear more, we cannot formulate the postures and policies that give those other groups something solid enough to make their own decisions on.</p>
<p>And I think that is what really is an opportunity to capitalize on here.  Black leadership has squandered billions trying to leverage up minority interests with the Stimulus.  And both the existing parties look at vote numbers solely with an eye towards power and holding it through the next election.</p>
<p>If the TP (or any third party attempt) is to hold together as a multiracial coalition, we MUST be the ones who mean what we say and stick to it, even when the immediate advantage is fulfilled.</p>
<p>So once again: think about what a black vote is likely to demand to come onboard and start bailing.  And then think whether the alternative is worse&hellip;</p>

<p>This is utter nonsense. What happened in Argentina had nothing to do with women&rsquo;s sufferage and  women aren&rsquo;t &#8220;hysterical&#8221;. When someone goes on a shooting rampage, guess what, it usually ain&rsquo;t women. The world was a mess long before women got the vote, it&rsquo;s still a mess today and mostly run by men, including the USA.</p>

		<p>As others have pointed out, blacks have in recent decades voted overwhelmingly for Democrats (almost always over 90%).  And now, all of a sudden, about one in three is a Tea-Partier?  Either the group selected for polling turned out to be extremely off from normal black opinions, or the pollsters are simply lying.  I suspect the latter.  Ano0ther reason not to believe this: have you ever seen more than maybe five or so black people at a Tea Party rally?  I have not.  Even Glen Beck&rsquo;s rally, which attracted hundreds of thousands, didn&rsquo;t have any minorities that I could find.</p>
