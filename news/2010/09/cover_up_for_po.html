			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Padraic Murphy, Herald Sun (Melbourne), September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A PLAN to force families to cover up to avoid offending Muslims at a public event has triggered furious debate.</p>
<p>An overwhelming 94 per cent of heraldsun.com.au readers disagree with the legal ruling approving the contentious ban during next year&rsquo;s Ramadan.</p>
<p>So far the Premier John Brumby has refused to weigh into the debate about the event, saying he will wait to see the VCAT ruling before making any comment.</p>
<p>VCAT has approved a ban on uncovered shoulders and thighs for a community event to be held at the Dandenong Oasis, a municipal pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Participants aged 10 and over must ensure their bodies are covered from waist to knee and the entire torso extending to the upper arms,&#8221; a request by Dandenong City Council and the YMCA states in an exemption application to the Equal Opportunities Act.</p>
<p>This issue has also sparked a huge community debate, with well over 500 people commenting on heraldsun.com.au this morning.</p>
<p>Many readers feel the administrative ruling has gone too far to appease minority interests, and even senior Islamic figures have raised concerns about the precedent.</p>
<p>The request has been approved by VCAT and applies to a family event to be held at the pool next August.</p>
<p>&#8220;The applicant intends this to be an event where people of all races and religions and ages may attend, use the Centre&rsquo;s facilities and socialise together,&#8221; VCAT notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The holy month of Ramadan has a particular focus on families and the applicant wishes to encourage families to attend and socialise together with others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The minimum dress requirements are set having regard to the sensitivities of Muslims who wish to participate in the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ban on skimpy clothes will apply between 6.15 and 8.15pm on August 21 next year, a time when the pool is closed to the public and normally used by a Muslim women&rsquo;s swimming group.</p>
<p>The ban was yesterday compared by the Human Rights Commissioner Helen Szoke to a ban on thongs in a pub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matters such as this are not easy to resolve and require a balance to be achieved between competing rights and obligations,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress codes are not uncommon: eg singlets, jeans, thongs etc in pubs/hotels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherene Hassan, vice-president of the Islamic Society of Victoria, said she didn&rsquo;t support the dress restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;My preference would be that no dress code is stipulated,&#8221; Ms Hassan said.</p>
<p>But Liberty Victoria said the ban was reasonable because the event was to be held out of hours.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the City of Greater Dandenong said the ban would help Muslims feel part of the community.<br>

		<p>White Liberal officials trip over themselves to prove how pro-diversity they can be, because they&rsquo;ve never had to risk a backlash from their white constituency.</p>
<p>A riled up electorate can be very effective in modifying the behaviour of office-holders and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The Aussies should keep up the grass-roots pressure until their governments respond correctly.</p>

		<p>Just about everybody wishes the Muslims would stay home, but if this draconian rule is imposed on Australians, they should boycott the event in protest. Make it nice and loud with a lot of signs to let everybody know that they are not going to bend over backward to accommodate the sensitivities of some whining immigrant group that most people don&rsquo;t want around anyway if they won&rsquo;t accept the norms and values of the resident culture.</p>

		<p>Swimming, beach life, pool life too [??] is now and has been for some time a BIG part of Aussie life?</p>
<p>NOT something the Muslim is even interested in?</p>
<p>I would think the Muslim is not even interested in beach culture, etc.</p>
<p>Extreme cases make for bad law and for bad policy too. </p>
<p>Those so-called &#8220;race riots&#8221; they had in Australia not so long ago were about Muslim &#8220;immigrants&#8221; intimidating Australian young women and beating nearly to death some life guards.</p>
<p>NOW, they are doing the utmost to placate the Muslim for NO real reason?</p>
<p>Some Aussie can comment on this?</p>

		<p>I mentioned before that during the Viet Nam war, those of us that were planning to go to Australia for R&R; were denied permission to go there because the Australians would not let blacks off the plane&hellip;.bet the Australians are sorry they yielded to American and U.N. pressures on that point now. Next, the Australians will have to recognize &#8220;black history month&#8221; and all the contributions blacks have given to White Australian history:)</p>

		<p>Muslims don&rsquo;t want to be a part of the Westernized community, they want to change and control everything about it.  Our women are allowed to walk around with their heads unveiled.  Muslims, however, make their women cover every part of their bodies from head to toe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never integrate well with us, nor do we want to have them around us.</p>

<p>The ban is for 2 hours one day next year when the pool is already closed to the public? This is silly. Who cares, the pool is rented by a private group so why does anyone outside of that group give a darn about the dress code?</p>

		<p>Muslim men will be saddened by this move. It&rsquo;s approved by their religious cops, also called &#8220;imams&#8221;, that muslim males are allowed to get their sexual fill of non-muslim women until they decided to marry - a muslim woman.  </p>

		<p> #5 you are quite correct.Living in Sydney I had not heard about the event in Victoria but I live very close to where the beach riots took place a few years back.This riot which became quite violent was all about the built up tension between the Muslim and generally white community here, triggered by intimidation of white girls, attacks on life savers and the general Muslim takeover of a popular family beach. It got quite ugly.<br>
One response by the authorities was to spend money to try and get Muslims involved in life saving and surfing, there was very little take-up by the Muslim community.<br>
How are things at this beach these days? Quite often there is hardly a Muslim in sight!<br>
Another failed example of Multiculturalism.<br>
PS, I am all in favour of seeing bathers dressed appropriately and reasonably modestly on any beach, but a full burqua with medievil looking robes, you have to be joking but that was what was happening!</p>

		<p>If they are so worried about how others dress they have a couple of options. Deal with it and grow a thicker skin or buy their own swimming pool and have a dress code, as a private business they have the right to limit patron&rsquo;s dress code. This is just a symptom of a larger problem, worrying about offending a group that needs to assimilate rather than separate themselves. </p>

		<p>I thought I read recently that the Australian government had told anyone who didn&rsquo;t like the laws of the country were welcome to leave. I was so proud of Australia. Now, this comes. Well, I hope their leaders follow through and tell the Muslims that they will be excused if they don&rsquo;t care to join in the festivities at the swimming pool. Please feel free not to attend, and you don&rsquo;t even have to bring a note from your mother, but be aware that this is OUR country and we will continue to do what WE want. Take it or leave it. Hopefully, Australia and every other country in the world will quit pandering to these people. In fact, let&rsquo;s urge them to go back to the Middle East where they can be happy among their own kind and won&rsquo;t be offended by the sun rising every morning.</p>

		<p>I used to cross the border between Saudi and Bahrain all the time.  Every time I did, you would see Saudi families just out of Saudi taking off all their traditional clothes and putting on shorts, bikinis, short sleeves or tank tops, etc.  Men, women and children.  They would then drive on to Bahrain and you would see them around the pool in skimpy bikinis (the women) while the men were in the bars drinking themselves into high spirits and chasing other women and treating the female staff like hookers.  When done for the weekend, they would all truck back to the border, put all their traditional cothes back on, cross back into Saudi and then look at disdain at the American troops with their rolled up sleeves on their uniforms - the uniform that had just saved them from Saddam.  They are the world&rsquo;s  biggest phonies.  It&rsquo;s all about power projected, this push to make US conform to their &#8220;religious sensitivities&#8221;.  They have NO problem adopting OUR customs and dress when they WANT to.  Look at them in any college or university.  The foreign muslims dress normally, hit on all the girls, drink themselves into stupors and party every weekend.  The ones wearing traditional garb are stupid AMERICANS trying to be muslims and look the part.  They are laughed at by the muslim foreign visitors.  But not discouraged, because those stupid Americans are the advance enablers of Islamic conquest in the west.  </p>

		<p>If I may make a totally off the wall comment here: in the USA, the multicultists are pretty fanatic in making Christians conform to the most outlandish liberal policies, such as accepting homosexual marriage. Yet at the same time, the multicultists are bending over backwards to force a nominally Christian peope   &mdash;   Australia   &mdash;   to conform to Islam. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of a greater war against the Western world. </p>

		<p>Muslims expecting non-muslims to bend over backward to accomodate are putting the foundation in place for sharia, when any non-muslim will be forced to bow down and give in to the whims of muslims, who will be the only &#8220;first class&#8221; people. They are just getting us prepared for dhimmi status. (Same with the sacred way the islam &#8220;holy&#8221;&#8221; book is treated.) Anythihg that &#8220;offends&#8221; muslims (anything they don&rsquo;t like) wlll be grounds for punishment. They&rsquo;re only beginning now with their threats of riots, lawsuits, or name-calling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to live in the &#8220;old&#8221; America, when threats from lesser countries/peoples were met with, &#8220;That is your custom? Well, our custom is to fight to the death for the freedom of our citizens.&#8221; </p>
