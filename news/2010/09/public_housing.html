			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lawrence Harmon, Boston Globe, September 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are two types of public housing in the state  &mdash;  about 50,000 state-subsidized units and 34,000 federally-subsidized units. {snip} But at the state-subsidized developments  &mdash;  {snip}  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just step right up, no questions asked about citizenship status.</p>
<p>{snip} In Boston alone, there are about 20,000 families on the waiting list for 14,000 occupied public housing units. But the hands of local housing officials are tied by a 1977 court ruling  &mdash;  federal, no less  &mdash;  that has been widely interpreted to mean that no immigrant  &mdash;  legal or illegal  &mdash;  can be denied a state-subsidized unit &#8220;solely because they are not citizens of the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants can really milk the system on rent day. Public housing tenants are required to pay about one third of their incomes for rent. But housing officials have no way to verify the incomes of illegal immigrants who work under the table. That allows some illegals to report no income and live rent-free. {snip}</p>

		<p>Free housing to everyone and open borders.  What could possibly go wrong with that?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats claim that taxes must be dramatically increased because cities and states are having a difficult time balancing their budgets.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s great when a plan comes to fruition. I have friends in Texas who are part of a large group of conspirators who convince illegals how nice it is in Massachusetts. Others should follow suit. </p>
<p>Politicians from Massachusetts have been instrumental in enacting most of the policies that have resulted in the uncontrolled influx of Mexican illegals. That being the case, I believe that the people who elected those politicians should have a fat man&rsquo;s helping of the stone age invaders from south of the border.</p>
<p>Boo-hoo, Massachusetts.</p>

		<p>This makes me sick! I worked 40 years and have to live on my SSA only and can barely pay my rent. Our local talk show host( a conservative) always has to defend nonwhites and talks about how Mexicans are so family oriented and have family values and Republicans need to reach out to them!</p>
<p> When we had a freeze here he spearheaded a drive for money, food, rent etc. to help these ILLEGAL farmworkers so they could stay here! Not only once but 3 times! He called them all hard working people who picked our crops and put food on our table! What a joke!  One caller even told him that he is enabling illegals to stay here and he just shrugged it off and said we are suppose to help those in need no matter who they are! He even had the nerve to preach to us by saying for those who don&rsquo;t want to donate because these people are Mexicans, then we don&rsquo;t want your help. He is a race traitor as far as I am concerned and I cannot stand to even hear his wimpy voice any longer. </p>
<p> I called and told him that they get section 8 housing and food stamps and he had a fit and said NO, they don&rsquo;t, they cannot get any aid!  I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t check it out before denying it and he said he didn&rsquo;t have to!  He wanted the foolish White listeners and callers to spend their own money to &#8220;help&#8221; these people in need!  Which they sure did!  He has NEVER had any kind of request for his listeners to ever help anyone of the White race! They were always NONwhites. </p>
<p> This is why I have no hope for White race to ever wake up to the threat among us. It is another reason I cannot stand the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; either or the Tea Party. They are always &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to nonwhites and wanting to bring them &#8220;into the fold&#8221; at our own expense. They have lost me forever.</p>

		<p>This bad news.  We don&rsquo;t want yankees in Boston to become aware of the dangers of illegal immigrants.  We know how cruel Bostonians can be, and if they are tough on the illegals, then we must absorb the refugee swarm that comes to Dixieland.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d rather yankees be just good, suffering liberals, because we can&rsquo;t afford more oversupply of destructive illegals.</p>

		<p>The real problem is the existence of public housing, a device used by FDR to control the immigrants of his day and force them to vote Democratic. </p>
<p>There is no constitutional mandate in the plain language of the Constitution for the gvt to be in the housing business, the housing finance business or the business of determing that non-citizens can live rent free while citizens must find their own housing at a cost. </p>
<p>But the Supreme Court and the vast majority of appellate judges legislate regardless of what the words of the Constitution say, and that is how it is. The legal profession and law professors on the whole applaud this judicial dictatorship.</p>
<p>Which is why we need new nations in North America with new constitutions, unaffected by the rulings of the Ivy League and social science-influenced judges who hold sway.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s time for a new Constitution. </p>

		<p>With the advent of Section 8 vouchers, there is no longer a need for the old fashioned concept of &#8220;public housing&#8221;, at least where I live, which is S.FL.</p>
<p>Where I rent the manager swore up and down they do not accept Section 8. So I went to Whitepages.com and did a reverse search. Out of the eight apartments in my building, only three had legitimate listings. The other five were all listed under the same name and phone #. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the Section 8 agent that advocates for these five apartments. And I&rsquo;m sure it is not his/her real name. </p>
<p>And where I rent I pay over a thousand a month-I used Rent.com which did not call this complex low income housing. But as I did further on line research into Section 8, it not only included my complex in its lists of Section 8 housing, it also called it &#8220;low income housing&#8221;. Yeah, IF YOU HAVE A SECTION 8 VOUCHER, THAT IS! </p>
<p>From the amount of rental housing listed, it seems pretty much that they ALL take Section 8. Section 8 even subsidizes electric and phone payments. Which is probably why the five families in my building are not listed in Whitepages.com - they compile their lists from phone and electric bills, etc.</p>
<p>This research only confirmed what i&rsquo;d already suspected - more than half the people where I live are on Section 8. And where I live is typical of what has been going on in this country - the government tries to keep you and I ignorant of the amount of people receiving assistance. It must be staggering.</p>
<p>So, am I surprised that there is probably a large number of immigrants on Section 8? Not at all. Oh, and if people think buying a single family home helps with the Section 8 problem, they are deluded. They also issue vouchers to rent single family homes. Here in south Florida, with the amount of home forclosures, the only way to get away from them is to move out of the state.</p>

		<p>I do not know what day it happened or why, but at some point the poverty-fighting organizations, like the community action agencies, gave up and quit helping poor people in favor of helping illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Let us be clear about this&hellip;.illegal aliens are not poor people. Many of them have at least one job..sometimes three..and they send a good portion of their cash back to Mexico or Central America. Whenever I try to convince the action agencies to do something for poor people, I get shoved out the door in favor of anything to help illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Maybe they have forgot what poor people in this country look like, but I have not&hellip;..and the illegal aliens are hardly what would qualify as poor. They can make more money panhandling on the street corner than many people in the welfare system.<br>

<p>Yep!</p>
<p>This entire story is reminiscent of the absurdism of a Monty Python skit out of the 1970s. Alas, it is happening today in America.</p>

Most likely, they have been taken over by &#8220;activists&#8221; - just like so many of our other institutions have been. Schools, foundations,  churches, government agencies, all have fallen to the militant activists. These charged-up social-engineering zealots, fresh out of collegeand  breathing fire, committed to their universalist one-world dreams, are completing the work of &#8220;the march through the institutions&#8221; that was planned so long ago and carried out so tenaciously by the disciples of the Frankfurt School gang.</p>
<p>This is what happens when a rich, confortable, self-indulgent society feels  secure and lets down its guard. We got what we allowed to happen to us.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All these programs degenerate into rackets. People are getting rich off this. I worked with a Russian immigrant Jew. His mother was somehow getting section 8 housing. He asked me if I knew anything about section 8. It seems he wanted to buy a house and put his mother in it as a section 8. Later I saw his mother&rsquo;s rental agreement left in the copier. She was renting in an apartment complex in West Hollywood owned by a Russian immigrant Jew. This area is well known for having alot of Russian immigrant Jews. How much do you want to bet the whole building is rented by them and you are paying these people to live and own apartment buildings in LA.</p>
<p>What a country!<br>
