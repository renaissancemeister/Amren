<h1>Class of First-Time Freshmen Not a White Majority This Fall Semester at the University of Texas at Austin</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>University of Texas (Austin), September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time in the history of The University of Texas at Austin, fewer than half of the fall semester&rsquo;s first-time freshmen are white students, according to a preliminary analysis.</p>
<p>The report, provided by Kristi Fisher, associate vice provost and director of the Office of Information Management and Analysis, shows the number of first-time freshmen who identified their ethnicity/race as &#8220;white&#8221; on admissions information total 47.6 percent. The university&rsquo;s overall total white student population, including graduate, Pharmacy Doctorate and law students, is 52.1 percent.</p>
<p>The figures reflect changes in the demographics of Texas. The Office of the State Demographer, Texas State Data Center, estimates the state&rsquo;s ethnicity in 2010 to be 45.1 percent Anglo (white), 38.8 percent Hispanic, 11.5 percent black and 4.6 percent other. The state&rsquo;s ethnic/race distribution by 2020 is projected to change to 37.6 percent Anglo (white), 45.2 percent Hispanic, 11.2 percent black and 6 percent other.</p>
<p>Fisher said the figures are based on 12th class day numbers. Final enrollment figures will be available in October, but there usually is little variation from the preliminary figures, she said.</p>
<p>Total enrollment at The University of Texas at Austin increased for the 2010 fall semester by 238 students (0.5 percent) from 50,995 last fall to 51,233 in fall 2010, according to the enrollment report, which uses new federally mandated ethnic and race reporting categories and provisions for students and employees to specify more than one race/ethnicity in identifying themselves.</p>
<p>The report shows undergraduate enrollment increased by 282 students (0.7 percent). Graduate enrollment (including Pharmacy Doctorate) decreased by 26 students (-0.2 percent) and law school enrollment by 18 students (-1.5 percent). The undergraduate one-year retention rate (91.7 percent) and six-year graduation rate (80.2 percent) remained relatively stable for fall 2010. There was an increase in the two-year retention rate, from 87 percent in 2009 to 88.5 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>Fisher said that starting this fall, ethnic/racial categories are being reported in accordance with newly implemented federal and state guidelines. Reporting categories are consistent with those adopted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) for the fall 2010 reporting cycle. Reporting changes include the introduction of two new race-reporting categories, &#8220;Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander&#8221; and &#8220;Two or More.&#8221; Students identifying themselves in more than one category with one being Hispanic are reported in the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; category only, in accordance with federal guidelines. Students identifying themselves as black, or in more than one category with one being black (and not Hispanic), are reported in the &#8220;total black&#8221; category. All other students identifying themselves in more than one category (neither Hispanic nor black) are reported in the &#8220;Two or More&#8221; category. Information describing the process of adopting new race and ethnic categories for students, faculty and staff members was described in an Oct. 15, 2009 university press release that may be viewed online.</p>
<p>Based on this reporting system, a preliminary analysis shows first-time freshmen enrollment figures increased for Hispanic and total black ethnic/race groups, as well as for foreign students. The ethnic/racial distribution of fall 2010 first-time freshmen enrollment is as follows:</p>
<p>* The white only category is 47.6 percent (3,464 students) compared to 51.1 percent (3,700 students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>* The Hispanic (any combination) category is 23.1 percent (1,680 students) compared to 20.8 percent (1,503 students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>* The black total category is 5.1 percent (372 students) compared to 4.9 percent (354 students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>* The Asian only category is 17.3 percent (1,260 students) compared to 19.6 percent (1,423 students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>* The American Indian only category is 0.2 percent (15 students) compared to 0.4 percent (29 students) in 2009.</p>
<p>* The Native Hawaiian category is 0.1 percent (four students); this is a new reporting category for fall 2010.</p>
<p>* The two or more  &mdash;  not Hispanic or black  &mdash;  category is 2.6 percent (190 students); this is a new reporting category for fall 2010.</p>
<p>* The foreign student category is 3.9 percent (282 students) compared to 3.2 percent (230 students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>* The &#8220;unknown&#8221; category is 0.1 percent (10 students) compared to 0.1 percent (four students) in fall 2009.</p>
<p>Fisher said her office compiles 10-year trends for ethnic/racial distributions of first-time freshmen (fall and summer combined). They show that since fall 2000, the proportional representation of Hispanic first-time freshmen has increased by 11.9 percent, total black freshmen by 1.8 percent and Asian freshmen by 4.9 percent. The proportional representation of white first-time freshmen has decreased by 12.8 percent, from 60.4 percent in fall 2000 to 47.6 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>Of the 14,583 first-time freshmen (fall and summer combined) offered admission for fall 2010, 7,275 (50 percent) enrolled. According to data provided by the Office of Admissions, 76 percent of all entering freshmen were automatically admitted under HB 588 (the Top 10 Percent Law). Of the entering freshmen from Texas high schools, 85 percent were admitted under HB 588.</p>
<p>The average ACT score for the entering class was 27 and the average Scholastic Aptitude Test composite score (mathematics, writing and critical reading) was 1819.</p>
<p>The preliminary analysis of graduate students shows enrollment (excluding law school) decreased by 26 students (-0.2 percent) to 11,589. Total law school enrollment decreased by 18 students (-1.5 percent) but new law enrollment increased by 10 students ((2.2 percent). The decrease in total law enrollment figures spans all ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Undergraduate enrollment increased for Undergraduate Studies by 801 (104.2 percent), Natural Sciences by 271 (3.1 percent), and Education by 201 (10.2 percent). Undergraduate enrollment in all other colleges decreased or remained stable, although a 793-student decrease in undergraduate enrollment in Liberal Arts was offset by a comparable increase in Undergraduate Studies.</p>
<p>Graduate enrollment increased for Engineering by 54 (2.7 percent), Geosciences by 27 (11.1 percent), Nursing by 17 (5.9 percent), Information by 15 (5.3 percent), Social Work by 7 (1.6 percent), Architecture by 6 (1.6 percent) and Public Affairs by 3 (1 percent). Graduate enrollment in all other colleges decreased or remained stable.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s total enrollment increased for the Hispanic and black ethnic groups. The ethnic/racial distribution of the total fall 2010 enrollment is as follows:</p>
<p>* The white only category is 52.1 percent (26,671 students) compared to 53.5 percent (27,263 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 2.2 percent decrease in the number of white only students.</p>
<p>* The Hispanic (any combination) category is 17 percent (8,725 students) compared to 16.2 percent (8,265 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 5.6 percent increase in the number of Hispanic students.</p>
<p>* The black total category is 4.5 percent (2,315 students) compared to 4.5 percent (2,276 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 1.7 percent increase in the number of black total students.</p>
<p>* The Asian only category is 15.2 percent (7,794 students) compared to 15.5 percent (7,910 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 1.5 percent decrease in the number of Asian only students.</p>
<p>* The American Indian only category is 0.4 percent (187 students) compared to 0.4 percent (215 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 13.0 percent decrease in the number of American Indian only students.</p>
<p>* The Native Hawaiian only category is 0.0 percent (19 students); this is a new reporting category for fall 2010.</p>
<p>* The category for two or more ethnicities  &mdash;  not Hispanic or black  &mdash;  is 0.8 percent (394 students) this is a new reporting category for fall 2010.</p>
<p>* The foreign students category is 9.0 percent (4,635 students) compared to 9.1 percent (4,656 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 0.5 percent decrease in the number of foreign students.</p>
<p>* The &#8220;unknown&#8221; category is 1.0 percent (493 students) compared to 0.8 percent (410 students) in fall 2009. It reflects a 20.2 percent increase in the number of students who listed ethnicity as unknown.</p>
<p>Fisher said this fall semester marks the implementation of new federally mandated ethnic and race reporting categories and provisions for students and employees to specify more than one race/ethnicity in identifying themselves. These changes were required of all colleges and universities, as well as primary and secondary schools throughout the United States, by the fall semester of 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure that reported shifts in the ethnic/racial mix of our student population are not merely artifacts of these changes to reporting methodology, the Office of Information Management and Analysis has carefully analyzed the impact of these changes with respect to categorization of multi-racial students,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;We performed six-year and 10-year regression analyses on the ethnic/racial percentage distribution trends of total and freshman enrollments and found the THECB reporting methodology to very closely follow the projected distributions for 2010. While we know of cases where, for example, black students identifying themselves as &#8216;black and Hispanic&rsquo; are now being reported as &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; only, the upward trend in minority enrollment percentages holds true and is not significantly affected by the reporting changes.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>The University of Texas has a lot of foreign students attending it also including those from Mexico and UT has been actively seeking non-Whites too, so it doesn&rsquo;t really have to do so much with demographics as to whom they admit. Also, Texas has a lot of illegals as well as Mexican citizens living here legally and a lot of other foreigners living here legally, so not sure what the real demographics are of the state if you count only citizens.</p>

<p>And what am I supposed to do, jump out of an imprisoning Marxist&rsquo;s tub normally reserved for dolphins, and squeak and squeal in delirious delight at such &ldquo;progress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I never will; in fact, it hardens me toward resolving the &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; problem by measures that would see Reds being put into tuna cans by the dolphins that can recite Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard III. These unmitigated loons and thugs (not to mention the loony thugs among them) always seep &#8220;tolerance&#8221; sap about the benefits of nonwhite demographic gains, like a retarded rainbow fish sucking on molded black seaweed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, in 50 years there will be no majority race in the USA;&rsquo; and &lsquo;oh, in 75 years whites could vote 100% for a candidate or referendum and still lose it….&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why such a triumphant focus on this, by these &ldquo;humanitarian progressives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because, quite simply, they are traitors or worse than traitors, Red psychopaths and otherwise fecklessly multicultural wretches!</p>
<p>May God help us all, to utterly obliterate them from the face of the Earth!!!</p>

		<p>What would have been the makeup of the students if you discounted GPA, which high schools can inflate just like colleges do, and only used the SAT or ACT scores, plus some weight, but not a majority, for extracurricular?  Texas guarantees the top ten percent of HS students admission to some campus of U Texas. But the top ten percent of Taco HS in Brownsville may consist of dope dealing kids who can&rsquo;t read beyond third grade level in English or in Spanish. As for the black graduates of Texas schools, well, a few do entertain on the football field. But can they count the yards gained?</p>

		<p>&#8220;UT Class of 2014: 45.1 percent white, 38.8 percent Hispanic, 11.5 percent black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the 11.5% who are black, I think it&rsquo;s accurate to say no more than 2% are qualified and are not AA gimmies.</p>
<p>Maybe 20% Hispanic earned a slot, or perhaps a wee bit more, but not much.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the funding get even smaller in all these schools, because they&rsquo;re nothing but radical institutions of social engineering, and the economy is getting worse, not better.</p>

		<p>#1 you sound well informed. It is quite possible we could have shared a silly wry smile or a rolling of the eyes during my 10 years on this enlightened campus? </p>
<p>The Division of Diversity &amp; Community Engagement has its tentacles spanning across the &#8216;40 Acres&rsquo;, so much so that nearly every employee has at one time or another gone to  diversity training &hellip;.aka indoctrination. A really pathetic place doing its best to remove white accomplishments and influence. White philanthropists (McCombs, Jamail, Jackson, O&rsquo;Donnell etc) have poured millions upon millions into this place, yet upon pulling onto campus you are treated to the Barbara Jordan statue. Of course no visit could ever be complete without a stop by the MLK statue as well. </p>
<p>The numbers produced by the Provost&rsquo;s office are certainly skewed. I can only attribute these figures as some typical leftist ploy to gain funding and demented attention. IMHO there is absolutely no way that blacks and hispanics combine for 50% of the &#8216;active&rsquo; enrollment - absolutely no way what-so-ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;What starts here changes the world&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.. ugh!</p>

		<p>As a commenter on the original story indicated, the majority of blacks are athletic &#8220;scholars.&#8221;  And most of these are women.  </p>
<p>Several complain that whites are still the overall majority since the minorities are a composite.</p>
<p>One of the categories is said to be &#8220;two or more.&#8221;  If one of the &#8220;more&#8221; is checked Hispanic then the student is counted in the Hispanic column.  If one of the &#8220;more&#8221; is checked black, they show in the black column.  (This is, evidently, something the Feds cooked up as a demand for &#8220;federal&#8221; financial aid).  Not sure what happens if the student is from a black/Hispanic combo.  Maybe that would be and example of one man, two votes.</p>
<p>A girl named Maggie (wonder what category she is?) hopes the quality of the school doesn&rsquo;t deteriorate because of the demographics.  How long this comment will be allowed to stay up, is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p>
<p>Also, the colleges (majors) of the students are not mentioned.  How many minorities are, for example engineering students?, and how many sign up for &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; or some other make-believe subject is not known. </p>

<p>Probably not nearly as much as in Ivy League schools, where Jews are about half of the &#8220;white&#8221; students.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget Arabs, Persians and other Middle Easterners are counted as white too.  </p>

<p>  My bet is that the dumbing down of the curriculum will greatly accelerate. Having worked in academia my whole career, I can testify that many of my academic colleagues are cheerleaders for this type of demographic transformation. They bring an enthusiasm for diversity reminiscent of an overly dedicated and intoxicated sports hooligan. What they don&rsquo;t anticipate is the consequence of increased school diversity: declining infrastructure, creeping crime, inter-racial strife, and lowered standards.</p>

<p>This says it all. The whites will be graduating in the sciences and the minorities will have degrees in PC nonsense like &#8220;the history of diversity.&#8221;</p>
