			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Myers, Independent (Dublin), September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>All good men everywhere are no doubt celebrating the news that the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is planning to run for office again, which, if completed, should bring his tenure as head of state to around 30 years or so.</p>
<p>To be sure, he is somewhat more responsive to the democratic process than dear old Fidel Castro; but still  &mdash;  30 years. By the end of which, he apparently intends to have one of the best air forces in Africa. And the really good thing is that the Irish taxpayer will have helped him buy it. You didn&rsquo;t know that, did you?</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m aware  &mdash;  from bitter experience, mark you  &mdash;  that there is no area of government in which civil servants are more hoity-toity and morally supercilious than are the aid officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I suspect that the department runs special classes in writing letters-for-publication dripping in sanctimonious condescension, and in delivering patronising knowing looks over the canapes at departmental receptions. Believe me, a mere columnist almost takes his professional life in his hands suggesting that somehow our money on foreign aid is being ill-spent or even wasted.</p>
<p>Ah well, here goes. As Museveni embarks on his next term in office, how it is possible that we are giving his regime about €44m a year, even as he is buying seven Sukhoi 30 fighters from Russia? This is one of the most advanced combat aircraft in the world, capable of flying at Mach 2, (twice the speed of sound) and its two Saturn turbofans probably generate more energy than Kampala uses in a week.</p>
<p>The Sukhoi has a 4.5-hour combat endurance, and a range of 3,000km. This will enable its pilots to see people starving at home and in Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and the Congo. Better still, with an in-flight refuelling system  &mdash;  which dear old Yoweri hasn&rsquo;t bought yet  &mdash;  the flight duration goes up to 10 hours and the range to over 3,000 miles. Just the job for bombing a village in the Congo, where, give or take, Uganda has been illegally deploying its armies for the best part of 25 years.</p>
<p>Museveni is buying six Sukhois, each costing about $22m, which is roughly half of what Irish Aid gives him every year. But the purchase price doesn&rsquo;t even begin to cover the cost of flying an entire squadron, because any modern sophisticated fighter aircraft is the mere apex of a complex pyramid of technology and human training. Which is the main reason why the words &#8216;African&rsquo; and &#8216;fighter-pilot&rsquo; occur in the same sentence about as often as &#8216;Aborigine&rsquo; and &#8216;Zurich&rsquo;, or &#8216;Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; and &#8216;humility&rsquo;. For every hour the Sukhoi spends in the air, it will need 10 hours&rsquo; maintenance on the ground, by highly skilled technicians. And to train a pilot costs around €10m.</p>
<p>In other words, Uganda&rsquo;s supersonic air force will be a force to be reckoned with at around the same time that Brian Cowan puts the Bord na Mona Ballylongford power station into orbit. For it is simply impossible for a Third World country  &mdash;  as we used to say, and I still do  &mdash;  to leap the technological ladder like that. The factors that enable a complex aircraft like the Sukhoi to fly  &mdash;  the fuel systems, the avionics, the maintenance regime  &mdash;  are utterly beyond Uganda&rsquo;s means.</p>
<p>This has been the lesson for all countries that have attempted to skip generations in the acquisition of aircraft technology. In the 1960s, Germany learnt this after buying supersonic Lockheed F104 Starfighters: some 292 planes were lost because the aircraft made demands that were completely outside the Luftwaffe skill-set. Iran did something similar with the F14 Tomcat, as did Saudi Arabia with British Aerospace Lightnings, which enlivened a few air-shows at Riyadh by crashing into crowds, until there were no pilots or planes or even crowds left.</p>
<p>Needless to say, our own Air Corps is not remotely in the same league as Uganda&rsquo;s, even as we rush headlong towards membership of the Third World. So why is this tertiomondified State of ours now effectively subsidising Ugandan efforts to equip its air force with a fighter aircraft that is considerably superior to anything even the British, the Italians or the Germans currently have?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as if the Ugandan air force has a perfect safety record. Last July, Uganda was able  &mdash;  had it so chosen  &mdash;  to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the death of Sudanese vice president John Garang who was killed in a crash of his Ugandan air force helicopter. The late VP was a close political ally of Museveni, and not even in the bizarre world of African politics is it the done thing to bump off good and essential chums. So, if the Ugandan air force can&rsquo;t keep a helicopter, carrying a vital ally, from flying into the ground, how will it keep a squadron of Mach 2 jet-fighters aloft?</p>
<p>Silly question. Obviously, the Department of Foreign Affairs will once again come up with an Irish solution to a Ugandan problem: more Irish money.<br>

		<p>TERTIOMONDIFIED!</p>
<p>Finally!  A better term than &#8216;third-world-ized&rsquo;.  The sound of Mr. Myers&rsquo; word makes me feel as if I&rsquo;m sitting in (pre-Arabic) Paris, having a wonderful dessert.</p>
<p>And saying &#8216;tertiomondification&rsquo; will feel as if I&rsquo;m imparting the finer points of whipping up a Creme de Vanille.</p>
<p>But seriously: that was a fantastic article, and Kevin Myers has a new fan.  I honestly didn&rsquo;t know you could find things like that in mainstream newspapers anymore.</p>

Why is Ireland giving anyone anything?</p>
<p>Barely twenty years ago they had to go begging for handouts to the EU. And they got them.  Now they are in the middle of a severe economic downturn  &mdash;  aka depression, threatening to reduce benefits to their own native jobless.</p>
<p>So who is encouraging these fools to buy a fleet of snazzy planes for, of all places, Uganda?</p>
<p><br>
Remember Irish politicians, charity begins in Ireland where, as ever, it is sorely needed. </p>

<p>Is this the same air force we read about where a black pilot hit his ejection button, but failed to pop his canopy first and wound up a black spot on his roof?</p>
<p>Or how about the black pilot who came in for a landing and wrecked his plane, because he failed to lower his wheels first, and both incidents was blamed on white racism.</p>
<p>Too, being one of Africa&rsquo;s best air forces is like being awarded for being one of the leaders in an incompetence test, while the rest of the world zooms by in top notch fashion.</p>

		<p>Has anyone from Ireland asked the following question. If blacks are 12 - 15% of the American population, wouldn&rsquo;t it also follow that they might hold 12 - 15% of all of the pilot jobs in the Armed Forces? I would be surprised if more than 2 -3% of the pilots in the US military are black. Few have ever been Squadron CO&rsquo;s. Yes some have made it to the ranks of General and Admiral. Are there some who can make through flight school without affirmative action, absolutely. But probably not enough to make the quota queens happy. </p>
<p>Think twice about who you are buying planes for. Most of the black pilots in the US fall into the category of the &#8220;Talented 10th&#8221;. Even if they grew up poor, it was not at Uganda&rsquo;s level of poverty. How about taking care of Ireland first. This makes about as much sense as handing my elementary school age kids the checkbook, a cache of loaded weapons and the keys to my car. </p>

		<p>This is the same Museveni who proposed an &#8220;African space program-Moon-Landing.&#8221;  Well at least he&rsquo;s lowered his sights bit as he now only wants an air force with advanced Su-30 fighters.  Pilots, maintenance, logistical support, airfields, etc probably has never entered his mind.  Wouldn&rsquo;t older MiG-19&rsquo;s or even heavily armed Cessnas be a better choice?</p>

		<p>Ha ha great article, selling cutting edge Russian war planes to africans, is about the same as selling nuclear submarines to a family of sea otters. They look impressive and all, but try to find a crew of engineers, pilots and mechanics to service them in a continent with no major reputable universities and a average of IQ barely north of mentally retarded.</p>
<p>IF they ever need to use these fancy lawn decorations they are going to probably wind up having to pay through the nose for eastern european mercenary pilots and ground crews and even then Uganda&rsquo;s only real enemies have been the Ugandan government itself (see Idi Amin). </p>
<p>In any event who cares, Russia, perhaps the last bastion of white nationalism could use the income, and if the Irish want to fritter their money on Africa than that is their choice, they will wise up or not, it is up to them.</p>

		<p>Ireland giving Uganda money for their air force is just another example of:</p>
<p>Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad.</p>
<p>Ireland, with a growing immigration problem taking their country from them; their economy going down the tubes and the fools - like many White people everywhere today - are speeding up the process of their own demise by funding an African country.  </p>

		<p>A civilized nation like Uganda makes a mistake or two. Really. for example the current President for Life helped dump his predecessor, the irrepressible &#8220;Idi&#8221; Amin. Amin&rsquo;s &#8220;appetite&#8221; for Life was breathtaking.</p>
<p>Idi garnished world respect for Uganda from the heights of respectability.  Envoys bearing gifts visited this wise man in his palaces. They came from Saudi Arabia, the PLO, the Soviet Union, China, and the US civil rights &#8220;community&#8221;.</p>
<p>And did Idi, a pilot himself (trained in Israel he did) need the most advanced weapons to ward off the racist hordes threatening his peaceful people? He did not. With their sometimes sharpened machetes bearing down on the necks of the racists and their stooges, Idi and his Horatio-like legions vanquished all.</p>
<p>We miss you, Idi.</p>

<p>Kevin is right. NO ONE to fly the planes with any degree of proficiency, NO ONE to maintain the planes. And NO ONE to use them against.</p>
<p>Just another play toy for your average-everyday African dictator. And done with Irish money too. The Irish must be very proud. They are now &#8220;playing&#8221; on the world stage. Congrats.</p>

		<p>What legitimate defense need of a country like Uganda is met by the purchase of Su-30s?  The article&rsquo;s comparison of the maintenance nightmare that will result with Germany&rsquo;s transition straight from F-86 Sabres to F-104 Starfighters (without gaining experience with any of the interim designs, like the F-100 Super Sabre or the F-101 Voodoo), Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crazy purchase of English Electric Lightnings and Iran&rsquo;s purchase of F-14 Tomcats is absolutely spot-on.</p>
<p>If I were an African leader looking to modernize an air force, I would first ask myself &#8220;What are the most likely tasks the air force will have to accomplish?&#8221;  In black Africa, the surest bet is counter-insurgency work against irregular forces who do not possess modern anti-aircraft weapons.  The aircraft best suited to this sort of work are the Rockwell OV-10 Bronco and the Argentinian Pucara.  Since an export permit from congress would be needed for the Broncos, the obvious choice is the Pucara.  A very secondary role for a sub-saharan African air force is combat with the air force of a neighboring country, possibly as part of a dispute over mineral rights.  Which aircraft best meet this criteria.  First and foremost, the machines must be easily maintainable in local conditions, which means an older, simple design is best.  Secondly, they must have good rough-field capability, which means a Russian design is probably best.  Blistering performance is not a major concern, as keeping the airplanes flyable will be difficult, and a fighter jet that isn&rsquo;t flyable is worthless in wartime.  My pick would be the Chinese-made Q-5.  This is based on the old MiG-19 fighter, with the air intakes moved to the wing roots and the nose faired over with a conical radome, among other improvements.  The MiG-19 is very maneuverable in both the horizontal and vertical planes, is structurally strong, and the 30mm cannons it mounts are immensely destructive.  Carrying heat-seeking missiles is no problem, and with the correct radar in the nose, radar-guided missiles would also be useable.  The Q-5 has an internal weapons bay for anti-surface ordnance, much like the old British Buccaneer attack jets (in fact, it has been described as a &#8220;poor man&rsquo;s Buccaneer&#8221;, but while weapons load is lower than for a Buc, the Q-5 has significant anti-air capability that the Buc lacks).  Pakistan bought the Q-5 when congress refused to allow them to purchase Vought A-7s; it&rsquo;s a good, versatile airplane and easy to maintain (so they&rsquo;ll still be flyable years from now) and the prices the Chinese charge are cheap.</p>
<p>Su-30s when Uganda is begging the Irish to pay for them?  You have got to be kidding me!<br>

		<p>Yes, the Saudis AND Kuwaitis both bought the English Electric / BAC Lightning.</p>
<p>The version of events told in the ranks of BAC in Saudi Arabia in the seventies was as follows:</p>
<p>Prince Sultan, Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation, was being wooed by the U.K. Ministry of Defence, who were eager to sell the latest Hawker Hunter to the RSAF to replace the Korean-War-era American F-86 Sabres. Prince Sultan was visiting Lossiemouth, an RAF station in Eastern Scotland, and witnessed a pair of Lightnings scream down the runway, fling themselves almost vertically into the low cloud and disappear.</p>
<p>Prince Sultan was entranced, brushed aside all mention of the Hawker Hunter and insisted on signing up to buy the Lightning. An immensely lucrative contract was signed with Airwork to provide training and maintenance; BAC [now British Aerospace - BAe Systems] took over the contract some years later. </p>
<p>Kevin Myers is in error; at least one Lightning survived and is on a pylon - like a completed Revell kit - outside Dharan RSAF base in the Eastern Province of KSA.</p>

		<p>He doesn&rsquo;t need to buy six of those jets.</p>
<p>There couldn&rsquo;t be more than 2 blacks in the whole country intelligent enough to fly them.  So I guess at least 4 will be for spare parts.  And of those two blacks, only one will normally be sober enough to fly on any given day.</p>
<p>So anyway, I guess these jets are to help the Muslims wage jihad in Africa most likely.</p>

		<p>True, this is great article indeed: in the same breath, Kevin owes his readers another story this time around about the daylight robbery by the International Oil Companies  such as Heritage Oil which has refused to pay Taxes to the poor and hungry Africans in Uganda. While you are crying over your 44mill euros of Irish Aid to Uganda, HERITAGE OIL has walked away from Uganda with a whooping $400m which should have been paid to Ugandans. </p>
<p>Kevin, your readers should also be told the background of the founder of Heritage Oil, Mr Tony Buckingham, who has personally pocketed a cool 84.5m pounds from the Heritage Oil deal with Tullow Oil in Uganda. This is the man who has flared up wars or attempted to, almost in every Oil/mineral-rich country on the African continent and has made a personal fortune out of the ensuing confusion, lawlessness and misery. </p>
<p>Though he officially abandoned his mercenary outfit - Executive Outcomes, which did a good job for him in Angola - his War-for-business- mindset will never abandon him. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if this grandiose Air force plan you are screaming about was the work of the military architect - Mr.Buckingham - who is also known to have struck personal friendship with Museveni.</p>
<p>Buckingham is known to have (or had) interests in Saracen - a private Security firm of South African origin and operating in several African countries. In Uganda Saracen is co-owned by Museveni&rsquo;s young brother and a General in Uganda Army. The firm has been providing Security cover to the Heritage Oil exploration acreage in Western Uganda.</p>
<p>Could it be possible that the Ex-SAS Officer, in one of his private encounters with the Ugandan President, painted for him a gloomy geo-political situation in the Great Lakes region in which the Security stakes for Uganda have been  heightened due its new-found oil reserves. This perceived threat from jealous neighbours would be best met by a dramatic tilt in the balance of terror in the region in favour of Uganda if it simply flexed its muscle for everybody around to see; and the acquisition of only 6 Sukhois will dramatically do the trick. And financing of the project? Do not worry, Heritage Oil will fix it. Motive? With access to Uganda&rsquo;s abundant Oil, Heritage Oil would &#8220;help&#8221; Uganda pay for the Sukhois with oil proceeds. In return, Uganda will open the oil reserves to Heritage Oil, ad infinitum. Simple. </p>
<p>With the Sukhoi deal tied to the country Oil resources, Uganda would enter into a long-term relationship with Heritage Oil - no matter how impoverishing and enslaving that kind of relationship may be, unfortunately. But fortunately, some Africans are getting smart too. One of them is Mr. Museveni. He is not your typical proto-type African President who detects an ulterior motive in a deal but selfishly goes ahead to bless it, however mucky.And whatever criticism you may have against Museveni, he is not a kind of a guy who will succumb to any scheme that will compromise the interests of Uganda. Yes, he may be a Castro in this regard.  Which could be one reason behind the fact that the purchase plan leaked to the press. And subsequently, Heritage decided to leave Uganda, sold its assets but has stubbornly refused to pay the Capital gains tax to the country&rsquo;s treasury. Why?   <br>
Yes, due to technological under-development,  it is the foreign firms in charge of African wealth. And the developed world for some reason  and if everything else were to remain equal, would  want the continent to remain that way - under developed, poor or just keep it breathing while bed-ridden with small doses of &#8216;Aid&#8221;, to control pressure from African migrants running way from poverty and disease. </p>
<p>Besides rhetoric and gestures of self preservation like &#8220;Aid&#8221; there is little genuine goodwill or action so far shown or taken on the part of the 1st world towards Africa, motivated by the intention to empower the continent to eventually develop itself to a higher level. Obviously AID in its current form and substance cannot lift Africa out of misery, and it was never intended to do so, anyway. It is only a &#8220;soothing agent&#8221;. That&rsquo;s it. For reasons that can be partially traced in the innuendos in some of the commentaries above, Africa is simply and intentionally denied the opportunity to develop despite its abundant wealth in natural and human resources. The origins of political mistakes committed by African leaders as well as the political and economic chaos that has bedeviled the continent are to be traced in the behind-the-curtain strategic decisions taken by states of the 1st world in conspiracy with their corporate cohorts in those countries - decisions which are driven by greed and exploitative motives towards a people,  believed to have,  well, according to one commentary above, &#8221; average of IQ barely north of mentally retarded..&#8221; </p>
<p>Mr. Kevin Myers and his compatriots, should soon have less to worry about - not in the least the Irish Taxpayer, since Uganda shall in the near future earn - from its currently known oil reserves only - enough money to finance its budget, 100% without donor support for over 40 years - assuming, of course, that the foreign Oil Companies and other players with super IQ do not take advantage of our low IQ and technological underdevelopment to come up with new exploitative tricks, but hopefully stick to a fair game and international standards of good conduct that they normally conform to in their 1st world. </p>
<p>By the way, the Irish Government and its Aid officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, are not exactly fools as you seem to think. They are simply smart, far-looking and more calculative than most of you ordinary guys are. For starters, what is 44m euros a year in your Irish &#8220;aid&#8221; to Uganda compared to what Aidan Heavey&rsquo;s Tullow Oil will earn for its share holders in Europe? The CEO of Tullow Oil, Irish himself, and the Irish Civil servants know very well how the so called  aid is an effective a diplomatic tool used to leverage political influence in  serving the long-term business interests and strategic objectives of the State of Ireland,in particular and of &#8220;AID&#8221; donor countries in general, in Africa. </p>

<p>Normally, I woiuld agree with you that Kevin Meyer&rsquo;s days would be numbered.  However, please see the best article ever written on Africa besides those appearing in AMREN:</p>

<p>Ireland is full of phoney save the world types and oh Ireland was a British posession for 700 years so we should identify with every third world piece of cow dung.  More and more people who have been to those slime pits increasingly recognize that it is the people who make them what they are.  </p>
<p>Recognizing that Ireland is one of the last Celtic Countries left on earth there is some recogniition that Irish language culture etc has to preserve itself.  But then you have the One World mentally derranged that want to make Ireland like the South Bronx.  It&rsquo;s a continuing debate.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Museveni is buying six Sukhois, each costing about $22m, which is roughly half of what Irish Aid gives him every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ireland is on the verge of economic collapse, more so than any other nation in Europe, including Greece.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s elites have to be fools for throwing away money to a black country that is NOT going to be able to develope any kind of airforce&hellip;thankfully&hellip;.because they just don&rsquo;t have the quality of people to do so.</p>
<p>Too, giving money to them for armaments is like giving matches to pyromaniacs.  Their propensity for war and violence is legendary.  However, if Ireland&rsquo;s intent is to create a war zone in the area, the move was the right one to make.</p>
<p>My first reaction is to wonder how the people of such an economically failing country as Ireland would stand for giving away money they can ill afford, until I&rsquo;m reminded that the same thing is happening here and throughout the West, only on a much larger scale, and the majority of people are too busy keeping up with the Lindsey Lohan developments and trying to find out who Snookie is. </p>
<p>The perverted elites in the Irish government probably feel as if they have to go along with the larger nations who donate money to blacks.  It all amounts to sending good money down a bottomless pit, wasted and never to be seen again, and certainly no benefit to anyone but blacks who want more armaments to pursue their natural tendencies for violence and killing.</p>
<p>Look for Ireland to start to cave toward the last few weeks of this year or the first quarter of the next, about the same time the Greek money infusion and austerity programs have proven to be no more than a slight interruption in their march toward collapse and civil war.</p>
<p>The dominoes will be falling again soon.  Many of us are prepared.  If you are still in denial, you won&rsquo;t be for much longer, especially after you are furnished with an example or two of what will be occurring as the norm.</p>

<p>There is/was as late as 07, another at the gate of Kuwait&rsquo;s Ali Al Salem AFB still in Kuwaiti markings.</p>
