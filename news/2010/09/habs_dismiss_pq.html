<h1>Habs Dismiss PQ Complaint That They&rsquo;re a Canadian Propaganda Tool</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The owner of the Montreal Canadiens has defended his team against accusations that it&rsquo;s a pro-Canada political tool.</p>
<p>Geoff Molson was asked Thursday about remarks made by the Parti Quebecois in recent days.</p>
<p>He called it a funny question and said it wasn&rsquo;t something he wanted to respond to. But Molson then offered a curt dismissal of the accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the hockey business and not into politics,&#8221; Molson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell you we don&rsquo;t talk about politics in the dressing room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quebec&rsquo;s official Opposition leader, Pauline Marois, said this week that the Habs have become a promotional tool for Canadian federalism.</p>
<p>She said she wished the team had more francophone stars she could cheer for. One of her PQ caucus members went even farther: Pierre Curzi said recently that the Habs are actively plotting against Quebec separatism  &mdash;  and that the exclusion of French-speaking players was part of that plot.</p>
<p>In making that argument, the PQ was picking up on a common complaint in recent years that the legendary team  &mdash;  once dubbed the Flying Frenchmen  &mdash;  has almost no French-speaking players anymore.</p>
<p>Curzi&rsquo;s comments earned him ridicule in Anglo media and a mixed response within Quebec.</p>
<p>Many commenters over the years have urged the Habs to be mindful of their role as a local cultural institution; they bristled, for instance, at the fact that former captain Saku Koivu never bothered to learn French.</p>
<p>But when language controversies occasionally flare up around the team, other fans react in frustration and say they wish people could keep their politics and their hockey separate.<br>

		<p>Les Habs [habitants, those that live in] WERE for decades the representation of French-Canadian pride. NO question about it. The team prided itself on having mostly French-Canadian stars that spoke FRENCH! NOW that you have globalization, the situation is different now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mon ami, c&rsquo;est le vie! Or something like that.</p>

		<p>It would hurt the team to make extra effort to get French speaking players. They&rsquo;d have to settle for lower quality players or else pay extra to get the good ones. That is if all other teams were operating in a free open market. On the other hand, it might be a good idea if all pro and college teams had to play with mostly local talent. That&rsquo;s true especially for Quebec but most other places as well. As it is now, there isn&rsquo;t much that is unique about any of the teams. How many players on the Green Bay Packers are from Wisconsin?</p>

		<p>Well, when Quebec finally secedes or Canada totally comes apart, the team can change its name to the &#8220;Quebecers&#8221; and drop the red from their uniforms. (The Quebec flag is blue and white.)</p>

		<p>They get into petty stuff like that.<br>
That&rsquo;s what some Quebecois are like.<br>
The number of French Guys on the Team<br>
matters. Also, Montreal named an American<br>
as Captain. <br>
On the other hand its good<br>
that The Quebecois, and I mean the<br>
French Canadien, have a strong Ethnic Identity<br>
and pride. This is more and more being<br>
diminished amongst White Ethnic groups.</p>

		<p>I remember reading the transcript of a speech given by a former canadian prime minister a few years ago in which he openly admitted that increased immigration was a deliberate strategy to undermine French separatists. The idea was to keep importing enough immigrants into Quebec to tilt the referendum into Canada&rsquo;s favor. That sounds crazy but the former prime minister openly admitted that they had done it. Though his name slips my mind. I&rsquo;m not that much of an expert on Canadian politics.</p>

		<p>More European Self Destruction. They are worried about <br>
English Canada that has coddled French Identity and bowed<br>
to every whim and freakish tempertantrum of the French<br>
speaking minority, but then the French&hellip;in true French<br>
fashion debase themeselves before  every Third World minority.<br>
The English are the enemy..but Haitians, Moroccans, Algerians<br>
Syrians, Lebanese..are cherished &#8220;authentic&#8221; cultures..even<br>
if they want to kill you at the first opportunity.</p>

		<p>Quebec will gradually but steadily assert its independence, but it will never separate from Canada unequivocally. Quebec&rsquo;s economy is based almost entirely on subsidies from the rest of Canada, pork-barrel politics and affirmative action jobs for Quebecois.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow covered this in his book The Patriot Game.</p>
<p>Racially aware Americans are often delusioned about Quebec, thinking it&rsquo;s an ethno-state. Quebec is now a multicultural state. But it maintains its victim status because they speak French. Quebec couldn&rsquo;t exist without its politically correct blackmail of English-speaking Canadians.</p>
<p>The only upside is that the Quebecois aren&rsquo;t physically scary, like blacks and Hispanics.<br>

		<p>This feud goes back to the French and Indian War.  While on one hand I can sympathize with the Parti Quebecois, whites need to start thinking big picture or we are going the way of the North American Indian.  Same applies to the North/South and Protestant/Catholic rifts in the US, as well as the Germans/Russians, Serbs/Croats, English/Irish, etc&hellip;in Europe. </p>
<p>BTW, the Montreal Canadiens had a near monopoly on the great French Canadian hockey players of the 50s and 60s because of the way the draft was structured back then.  Teams had first dibs on players within x miles from their arenas.  Today, the young hotshot from Montreal can just as likely end up in Los Angeles or Nashville.<br>

		<p>I doubt highly any of the current-day Habs talk about politics in the locker room. But it is fact that the Canadiens were formed over 100 years ago as the team of the French-Canadiens in Montreal. The English speakers&rsquo; &#8220;team&#8221; was the long-forgotten Montreal Maroons. </p>
