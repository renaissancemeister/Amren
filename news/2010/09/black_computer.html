			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>M. Brian Blake and Juan E. Gilbert, Chronicle of Higher Education, September&nbsp;19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black people are so underrepresented in computer science that the term &#8220;black computer scientist&#8221; might be considered an oxymoron.</p>
<p>African-Americans represent about 13 percent of the U.S. population but less than 6 percent of all faculty members at American colleges and universities. In the field of computer science, however, they make up only 1.3 percent of the faculty, according to the Computing Research Association&rsquo;s widely used &#8220;Taulbee Survey Report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, while statistics vary, the percentage of doctorates awarded to black computer scientists is small: The report says 1.6 percent of such degrees went to blacks in 2008-9, while federal data show that 3.7 percent, or 26 of 695 doctorate recipients in computer and information sciences in 2008, were black U.S. citizens or permanent residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given the evolving role that information technology plays in our day-to-day lives, one would think that more blacks would be pursuing computer science. So why are we not producing American-born black computer-science professors? Since the two of us fall into that category (and are, we hope, professionally successful), we hear this question all too often: Why aren&rsquo;t there more like us?</p>
<p>The presumed answers are many. Are black students not interested in or adequately exposed to computing fields? Are they not prepared? Or, as some may wonder (but will never say), do black students lack the aptitude to succeed in computer science? {snip} Is it unreasonable to assume that students would not gravitate to a field that has so few people who look like them?</p>
<p>Several scholarly studies have suggested that African-Americans tend to select occupations in which they have had contact with successful black role models. {snip}</p>
<p>We wonder if black students receive different instruction. Among science and math graduate students, 17 percent of black students reported publishing journal articles, while the figures for other groups were 49 percent for Asians, 42 percent for Hispanics, and 47 percent for whites, according to Three Magic Letters: Getting to Ph.D. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006).</p>
<p>At the same time, in our experience, we generally believe that administrators sincerely want success for underrepresented minorities (which in our field means female, black, Hispanic, and American Indian students). Often this adds pressure on faculty members to be successful when they mentor such students. Wouldn&rsquo;t such implicit, and sometimes explicit, pressure alter a natural mentoring relationship?</p>
<p>We offer several recommendations for increasing the number of black computer scientists: Provide access and exposure. Black students need more access to information about computing careers and more exposure to role models who make them feel welcome in the field. {snip} Obviously, there is a need for black role models in computing.</p>
<p>Treat the entire pipeline. Interventions that increase the overall number of black computer scientists must range from elementary- and secondary-school students to undergraduates, graduate students, and new Ph.D.&rsquo;s. We believe that students develop their personal preferences of professions at an early age, even before high school. The way computing is presented to them can have a profound impact on their perception of the field. If the material is not presented in an accessible manner, or if the student cannot relate to the presenter, we lose that student.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All activities are designed to address barriers, concerns, and misunderstandings about jobs and research in computer science. The activities have included a series of presentations at historically black colleges and universities by black computer-science professors and graduate students from various institutions. Together we run a group that provides mentors for graduate students who want to become academics, and an annual miniconference designed to help undergraduates and graduate students build research and other skills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mentoring process can be summed up in two words  &mdash;  tough love. Considering the dearth of black students and the pressure for success, do faculty mentors feel comfortable setting high expectations and giving their black mentees the constructive criticism necessary for success in the academic job market? We believe this might be a significant challenge when the communication must cross ethnic and gender lines. Obviously, same-race mentorship is not absolutely necessary, as we both had non-black Ph.D. advisers (Hassan Gomaa, at George Mason University, for Mr. Blake, and C.Y. Han, at the University of Cincinnati, for Mr. Gilbert).</p>

		<p>If a Black has the intelligence to obtain a Phd in computer science, he has the intelligence to realize that computer science is usually a bad choice for his career. Why? He knows that he will be competeting against Oriental and Indian geniuses. They are far more intelligent then he, and also qualify for Diversity credit. He knows that it usually would be in his interest to go into other fields such as law, medicine, management. In these occupations his intelligence will about average, and his communication and social skills will give him an advantage over the immigrants. </p>
<p>As an aside, I wonder how much governmental money has been spent in making all the studies, presentations, and surveys (which are activities that Blacks are good at) that the article references.</p>

		<p>Consider two bell curves. One representing white IQs and the other black (which is 20 pts lower).  At the upper end of the bell curves, where computer scientists are found, blacks are 30-40 times less frequent than whites at the IQ of 150 level.  See the answer is easy and doesn&rsquo;t require any leftist dogma.</p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;ll</i> say it: they lack the aptitude.  I used to work at A Major American University(tm), and management of our computing facilities was in a constant hand-wringing agony over getting more blacks on the departmental payroll.  Alas, not one of their black hires ever was able to accomplish anything more impressive than showing up for meetings   &mdash;   most of the time.  Finally, management had to settle for anyone non-White, and got their Diversity points from a couple of genuinely talented Oriental student interns.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Is it unreasonable to assume that students would not gravitate to a field that has so few people who look like them?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>One might, with equal justice, ask the same of <i>White</i> students.  But no one ever will.  Apparently the black ego is so fragile that the slightest impediment will cause it to wilt and collapse.</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent from this blathering torrent of high-sounding verbiage is any mention of just <i>why</i> anyone should care about the percentage of blacks in computer science.  There are no barriers to prevent blacks from participating if they have the inclination and the talent.  Quite the contrary, in fact.  But they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> participate, so we must presume that blacks as a group lack one or both qualities.</p>
<p>Why, then, this extraordinary concern for getting more blacks into the field?  Will the American IT industry somehow become more dynamic and productive?  Will black programmers have some sort of radical new insight that will propel the field to new heights, simply by virtue of being black?  What is the perceived benefit that is supposedly the goal?</p>
<p>Does <i>no one</i> ever stop to ask <i>why</i> it&rsquo;s so desperately necessary to have more blacks in the computer science field?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking rhetorically, of course.  Plainly, the goal is to make certain that <i>no</i> area is permitted to remain majority-White, especially one like computer science, which   &mdash;   rightly or wrongly   &mdash;   carries a traditional cachet of intellectual superiority.  And since few blacks are either willing or able to participate, no effort is too costly to force-feed them into the IT field.</p>

		<p>They are plentiful on TV. Can&rsquo;t watch anything anymore without a oversupply of Diversity Inclusion, which is code for inserting blacks into everything so that White Humanity will have nothing left of our own.  </p>
<p>The History Channel is the worst offender of White Humanity&rsquo;s God given sense of taste and privilege.  Can&rsquo;t see a show about astronomy without at least two very ugly afros telling us how everything works.  Add them to the women, and White Males make up a minority of science experts on TV.</p>
<p>On TV commercials, the huge, hulking blacks are always coming to the rescue of the moronic acting Whites, who couldn&rsquo;t figure anything out until the black man with the serious attitude showed up and gave us the correct answer.  Look for it.  It&rsquo;s a repeated pattern. </p>
<p> I always wonder if White teens and our young people see it and think, &#8220;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, thank goodness for all these Diversity Blacks who are coming to our rescue.&#8221; Or, to they do the right thing and shout forbidden and &#8220;unforgivable&#8221; words at their TVs and change the channel, which doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem, because the same disgrace is on every channel.  No wonder our White Youth is destroying itself with booze and drugs. What&rsquo;s to look forward to when surrounded by Diversity Reality?  Escapism may be the only option.</p>
<p>Blacks demand more blacks on TV- https://tinyurl.com/3863jh6 </p>
<p> When blacks see a White person on TV, they see discrimination, but don&rsquo;t you just know they like seeing the meek and mild Whitey being SURROUNDED  by blacks?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I like a good hater.&#8221; -Samuel Johnson</p>
<p>Are you keeping up with the introductory news about the War Between the States SesquiCentennial?  Diversity Inclusion is all the fashion.  Can&rsquo;t have a 150th memorial without blacks at the event and then most of them included in the photos for the local newspaper and national magazine.   I was looking forward to the 150th being a time of renewal of Nullification and Secession and Confederate heroism, but unfortunately, it has already become a platform for official institutional  White elites to prove how anti-raciss they are by including the black perspective on the Confederate War. </p>
<p>Now, my hate is getting bigger.  </p>
<p>Instead of attending these disgraceful events, my friends and I will hold private Whites Only ceremonies, solemn and proper, honoring the Confederate Cause, which is the undying Cause of White Humanity&rsquo;s Liberty from  outsiders and foreigners, especially the Boaz-Myrdal and their pet Afros. We will perform secret religious rites and rituals, and keep close in our hearts the valor of our ancestors.</p>
<p>When the History Channel starts its series on the 150th and broadcasts  as many &#8220;distinguished, esteemed, and renowned African-American&#8221; historians and commentators then as it does black scientists now, we will &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; and boycott all their advertisers.  Our business remains unfinished&hellip;</p>

		<p>However tons of them are found in applications and systems analysis which don&rsquo;t require computer science degrees. Because computers eliminate many skills middle class people normally needed, like math and sorting information by use of inference, blacks vault into the middle class and thus into middle class neighborhoods they otherwise couldn&rsquo;t afford unless they had a govt job. Computers are one of the few private sector fields that allowed people who can&rsquo;t independently think to escape poverty.</p>

		<p>I notice the old arguments for why there are so few blacks in computer science, that is, that impoverished blacks have little access to technology, are no longer trotted out so often. In this age when there is a computer lab in every public school and when blacks have so much access to technology that they can plan riots with their cell phones, such an argument would no longer fly. </p>
<p>Instead, the new argument is lack of &#8220;role models&#8221; the vicious circle kind of argument that liberals love so much, since it can be trotted out indefinitely. But even while the argument claims to be defending black intellect, it is really insulting it, because it claims that blacks are to stupid to pick up a book or magazine or even browse the Internet for inspiration and role models.</p>

		<p>Poster #4 is right on about the super-diversity you see on TV, and this is an issue that is of great interest to me.  I stopped watching the Mentalist in the second season because they brought in a &#8216;wise and street tough&rsquo; black female as the boss of the entire investigative unit.</p>
<p>This new boss immediately forced two of the white detectives to stop dating, then she ran roughshod over the white female lead detective and put Patrick &#8220;Jane&#8221; (the Mentalist dude) in his place (though she left the nuetered asian detective alone).</p>
<p>I mean, she seemed so out of place, I couldn&rsquo;t suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the show.  She had the swagger and &#8216;tude of a subway clerk or department of motor vehicles clerk named Shanita.  </p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t like &#8220;House&#8221; because the genius white guy answers to a black man dept. administrator who you know in real life would not be there.  Then CSI Miami has the same thing, then more shows and more shows&hellip;  No there is a new show called Undercovers about a black male and black female detective duo and love interest.  Why would I watch it?</p>
<p>Well, not enough black computer geeks, I guess we need to spend tons of money to fix that!</p>

<p>Black physicist, black brain surgeon, black astronaut, black PhD candidate, and black computer hacker of renown. Just watch TV or the movies, you see a lot of them.</p>
<p>NOT to mention the super-smart black detective chasing down the really bad guy whitey criminals. You see a lot of that too in the movies on on TV.</p>

		<p>the average black has a IQ around 80. This means they are barely coherent. To be a software engineer you need a IQ around 130 MINIMUM. There simply are no blacks smart enough. Some may get a PHD but its a token fake degree none of them work in industry. I&rsquo;ve worked in software for 20 years and I have NEVER EVER seen a black software engineer. NOT EVER. NOT EVEN ONE.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Poster #3. </p>
<p>Who cares how many blacks are getting advanced degrees in computer science? What does that have to do with anything? They make it sound like it&rsquo;s the lunch counter at some segregated Alabama restaurant in 1955 to explain the reason (read: blame). </p>
<p>No one is preventing blacks from studying computer science. Or physics. Or medicine. Or chemistry. It&rsquo;s not my problem - or anyone&rsquo;s problem - if they don&rsquo;t enter those fields. The problem is white liberals who see only color and discrimination in everything.</p>
<p>Hence, blacks are pushed into occupations and professions (almost always through affirmative action-like programs) after being told by guilt-ridden whites that &#8220;you can do anything.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Many blacks are sadly so ignorant they believe it. Then when they fail they assume it is due to THE MAN holding him down. Liberals who encourage and drive blacks into such untenable academic situations make things 100x worse for everyone.</p>
<p>Getting back to the issue of just 1.6% of computer science doctorates being awarded to blacks, this is like the same article year after year - just change the subject.</p>
<p>I find it absolutely astonishing that intelligent people waste so much time, energy, and money searching for what is such a simple explanation. Blacks lack the native intellectual ability. On the whole, as IQ tests show, and simple observation confirms, they are not an intelligent race. Many are just out and out dumb.</p>
<p>Of course they are not going to study computer science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my fault. Don&rsquo;t blame me - or other whites - for evolution - or lack of it. I don&rsquo;t feel guilty and I don&rsquo;t appreciate anyone trying to lay a guilt trip on me because not enough people of color are in graduate computer classes. </p>
<p>Enough already!</p>

		<p>Obviously, the Cultural Marxist enemy of all White European men and women are not deterred by realism regarding IQ and aptitude in the computer science / information technology sector.  Hence, you can hit any major web site of the big computer giant corporations such as HP, Microsoft, Dell, etc., and I will guarantee to every AR community member that you will be &#8216;treated&rsquo; to tons of glossy pictures of blacks carrying computers or portrayed in such a fashion as to appear to be the resident computer genius, and any white males who might rarely be shown in the same photograph will be usually seated, and gazing up at their black computer wizard with an expression of awe and humbleness plastered on the faces.  </p>
<p>I stopped watching TV about 15 years ago, but even back then - I can remember the endless parade of faux black computer geniuses and black brain surgeons or black rocket scientists wearing white lab coats being served up to the viewing audiences, and presented as those these areas of employment were realistic portrayals of life in America.  And, as incredible as it might sound to people in the AR community - millions of our white fellow kinsmen and women have been snookered into believing these ridiculous fantasies.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand the importance being placed upon &#8220;role models&#8221; of the same race as a necessary requirement for someone to go into a particular field. If you&rsquo;re good at something, don&rsquo;t you just <i>go ahead and do it?</i> </p>

		<p>I suspect the problem with achieving diversity in computer science flows from the fact that your work product either achieves the desired results or it  fails. Computers are binary systems they have no way to know they are dealing with a black and aren&rsquo;t suppose to hold him to the same laws of math, physics and electrical circuitry that hold true in the rest of the universe. There is simply no way to pretend a blacks performance is adequate or have some white guy actually carry the load while he pretends to contribute by producing gibberish.  The program either works or is doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This is really a shocker.  With all the black nuclear physicists, black chemical, mechanical, and aeronautical engineers, black mathematicians, black scientists of all stripes, and black classical scholars, how does one explain the lack of black computer engineers?  </p>

I understand that the new cop  program &#8220;Detroit 187&#8221; (which has been mentioned here), produced by David Zabel,  also features a black female as the &#8220;no nonsense, tough but maternal, single black mother boss&#8221; who  runs the homicide unit. </p>
<p>The two main characters are another of those ubiquitous black-white buddy teams. In this case, the cranky older detective (white), full of cynicism, resents his peppy, pleasant young black partner, who is full of enthusiasm. But we can already predict with confidence that they will, in time, warm up to each other and become a great pair of inter-racial buddies &hellip; as the warmth and humanity of his black partner breaks through the crust of the cranky, hostile white man.<br>

		<p>LOGIC or logical reasoning is critical to a programmer. Blacks are conspicously lacking in this ability. To solve problems, the <br>
genuine studier considers ALL THE EVIDENCE - ALL THE OBSERVATIONS. He then proposes a solution (cause and effect)which best satisfies these facts. Blacks are perfectly content to live with failure as long as there is a white man to blame. They can&rsquo;t find solutions to anything because of prejudice and the lack of critical thinking ability. </p>

		<p>The Cost Of Selling Stupid:</p>

politicians and pundits mourned the migration of blue-collar jobs from advanced industrial countries to emerging economies. More recently, they fretted over the flow of low-level white-collar jobs. In both cases, their one piece of advice for the advanced countries was to do what they did best: innovation.</p>
<p>Think again. Now even innovation appears to be fleeing to low-cost countries, as they seemingly leapfrog the traditional stages of development. Clearly, we are at the beginning of a fundamental shift in where R&D; is performed.<br>

04/12/2006 - China will this year for the first time spend more on research and development (R&D;) than Japan and so become the world&rsquo;s second highest investor in R&D; after the United States, according to OECD projections based on recent trends.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;The rapid rise of China in both money spent and researchers employed is stunning,&rdquo; said Dirk Pilat, Head of the OECD&rsquo;s Science and Technology Policy division. &ldquo;To keep up, OECD countries need to make their research and innovation systems more efficient and find new ways to stimulate innovation in today&rsquo;s increasingly competitive global economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on recent trends trends, China will spend just over USD 136 billion on R&D; in 2006, just over Japan&rsquo;s forecast USD 130 billion. The United States is predicted to remain the world&rsquo;s leading investor in R&D; in 2006, spending just over USD 330 billion.<br>

The East provides increasing opportunities for biotech companies seeking to optimize product development and accelerate time to market. But any undertaking in China or India requires close scrutiny of the risks.</p>
<p>Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the biotech sector face a long, arduous journey toward successful commercialization of early-stage products. To get their products to market more efficiently and to realize their true commercial potential, biotechs are looking for new resources to tap for a productivity boost, and for new markets for their products.<br>

Companies that spend a part of their R&D; budget in low-cost countries such as China and India do better on sales growth and market cap growth.</p>
<p>As business becomes increasingly global, corporate innovation strategies are becoming more global as well: Multinational companies are spending a significant - and growing - share of their research and development money outside the countries in which they are headquartered.<br>

Of course it&rsquo;s always sad when &#8216;economists&rsquo; determine the how and why of our national capabilities base but the reality is that, between men like Greenspan advocating undercutting our high end technologies graduates _from college onwards_ (high tech companies like Dell and Boeing told not even to include U.S. grad students in H&R; managers viewed list of portfolios because their salary demands are too high).</p>
<p>And the massive abuse of the H1B Visa system to provide sub industry standard pay for foreign tech field experts whose degrees are really not worth the paper they are written on (Indians with associates degrees masquerading as bachelors or even MSD level eggheads).</p>
<p>You have to be an utter idiot to go into high tech in this nation anyway.</p>
<p>America is on the way out folks.  And what will replace it will be a thousand times worse than your worst nightmares because, when the globalists fail and everything burns down, they will have created a status quo where there is no geographic boundaries to protect intelligence and reason from utter barbarity.</p>

		<p>I did some research while an undergrad at UCLA a few years ago. I found a source that broke down the ethnicities of recently conferred PhD&rsquo;s. Computer science was one of the whitest categories as in some years the entire country produced ZERO black recipients. Funny how in Hollywood every other computer nerd is black. Not so in real life.</p>
<p>Second observation   &mdash;   Larger employers will load up on black employees for menial jobs as they are unable to find black professionals. That way they can still point and say &#8220;we have 13% black employees&#8221;. As a result white janitors, porters, etc. are also squeezed out of the market.</p>

		<p>20:  Notice that the first perp in the series premiere was white.  A white murderer, in Detroit?  And the only black criminal shown was a dope dealer who admitted to stealing oxycontin from the drug store, but had nothing to do with the murder.  I wasn&rsquo;t aware that slinging oxy was a black &#8220;thang.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pace and writing are okay, and I would have stuck with this show were it not for the blatant racial fiction.</p>

<p><i>the average black has a IQ around 80. This means they are barely coherent. To be a software engineer you need a IQ around 130 MINIMUM. There simply are no blacks smart enough. Some may get a PHD but its a token fake degree none of them work in industry. I&rsquo;ve worked in software for 20 years and I have NEVER EVER seen a black software engineer. NOT EVER. NOT EVEN ONE.</i></p>

<p>True!  </p>
<p>I know someone who works in computer science in a well-paid classified position in an extremely diverse part of the country.  Unclassifed software engineers can&rsquo;t even enter his building, so that means <b>no H1-B visas or non-citizens allowed</b>.  If there WERE high-level, competent black software engineers, he would see them&hellip;but there are NONE.  </p>
<p>The people in his building must actually produce quality software every day, pressured by strict deadlines, so diversity hires are totally prohibited by the requirements of the job.  The staff is White, with a handful of American-born North East Asians.  He once met a hispanic that looked mostly white, but the guy wasn&rsquo;t there long.  No blacks what-so-ever! </p>

		<p>Re the TV series &#8220;Detroit 187&#8221;:(The term 187 refers to the code for homicide,as popularized by Snoop Doggy Dog  &mdash;  who needs NO introduction on this site!!  &mdash;  in his opus&#8221;187 On a Unda Cova Cop&#8221; . That refers to L.A. I didnt know they had the same codes in DE-troit!) Anyway,the Italian guy form the Sopranos,the lead,is really good. The absurdly PC characters not so much. At one point,the tough no-nonsense latina stares daggers at a white cop who says he lives in the suburbs:&#8221;I live 10 minutes from here  &mdash;  and I pray the next victim isnt someone i know!&#8221; Oh my God!So brave! God bless you!! Stupid whitey! Livin&rsquo; in da suburbs!! </p>
