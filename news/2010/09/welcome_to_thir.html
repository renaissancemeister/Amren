<h1>Welcome to Third World Britain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Griffin, White News Now, September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain&rsquo;s slide from a law-abiding, decent, honest and democratic society to a third-world banana republic is gathering pace with the news that five Muslim Conservative Party members, including two councillors, in Bradford have been jailed for just over seven years after being found guilty of large-scale voter fraud.</p>
<p>The &#8216;New Conservatives&rsquo; have joined the growing list of Muslim &#8220;politicians&#8221; in Britain from all the Westminster parties who have been found guilty of importing election &#8220;tactics&#8221; from their third-world homelands to Britain.</p>
<p>The Leeds Crown Court Judge Robert Bartfield warned that the fraud threatened to &#8220;contaminate&#8221; Britain&rsquo;s democratic foundations and render those principles &#8220;worthless.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a local report, Tory councillors Reis Khan and Jamshed Khan conspired in a plot with fellow Conservatives Mohammed Sultan, Mohammed Rafiq and Alyas Khan to use fraudulent postal votes to get their candidate Haroon Rashid, elected to the Bradford West seat.</p>
<p>The practice of Muslim cheating in Britain&rsquo;s elections is widespread. In Slough, Berkshire last year, Six British Pakistanis were jailed for postal vote abuse.</p>
<p>In an earlier case in Birmingham in 2005, local elections were voided and had to be re-run at a massive cost to the taxpayer, as several Pakistani candidates were found to be operating what was described as a &#8216;vote-rigging factory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The judge presiding over that case commented on government claims at the time that postal voting was working: &#8220;Anybody who has sat through the case I have just tried and listened to evidence of electoral fraud that would disgrace a banana republic would find this statement surprising.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growth in Third World corruption is an inevitable consequence of the third-world colonization of Britain. All the signs are there, and the only question still to be answered is if the British people will read the signs and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Is this the country that Churchill, Monty and our War Heroes fought for? Is this the country you want for your children? Things will only get WORSE.</p>

<p>In Canada, they form voting blocks to shut out whites, and, in cases of a three-way race against a white, even threaten their own not to divide the Pakistani vote.</p>

<p>The Pakistanis are also muslims and avid supporters of Sharia law. Paki muslims are the second nastiest people I have had to work with, Somalis/Ethiopians being THE nastiest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely their fault; &#8220;Pakistan&#8221; is an inherently unstable because it is not a real nation-state, but rather a ramshackle, stapled-together construct whose borders have nothing to do with the ethno-linguistic lay of the land.   It has four major national groups that speak mutually unintelligible languages and all of whom are divided from their ethnic kin by &#8220;Pakistan&rsquo;s&#8221; borders.</p>

<p>Actually, these two groups are very distinct.</p>
<p>East Asians outside their homelands are not nearly as politically aggressive, vocal, active, or organized.  They tend to be focused on business.  For example, while Chinese dominate the economy of Indonesia, they have almost no political power.</p>
<p>South Asians are quite different.  Like many other non-white groups living in the West, including blacks, mestizos, and others, they gravitate more toward politics, perhaps to compensate for their average IQ being lower than whites&rsquo; or East Asians&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>Look at the Corruption Perception Index at Transparency.org</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table" rel="nofollow">https://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table</a></p>
<p>Note that Pakistan and the other Islamic countries are among the most corrupt in the world.  Of course they bring this culture of corruption with them when they come to western countries.  This is one of the most damaging things about &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;.  Even China is very corrupt, and they bring this corruption (or at least shady business practices) to the west with them.  In Vancouver some enterprising Chinese person was running a driving school that involved bribing the driving examiner (also an immigrant).  Another was writing software for Chinese restaurants that allowed them to cheat on sales tax.  And people people from the 3rd world are the most appalling drivers.  They have NO respect for the rules of the road.  But of course we dare not speak out about the way our society is degenerating, or we will be persecuted for &#8220;hate crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wish we could go back to the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>They band together, work together, organize together in every possible way - they hire each other, they vote for each other, they rig elections so that they can take power.</p>
<p>And yet if whites were to do the same - consciously, as white people - well, that&rsquo;s heresy, that&rsquo;s Thought Crime.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s an outrageous thing to say. After all, just because immigration has made things worse for the last 50 years is no reason to think that it will continue to get worse. At some point the <i>magic</i> of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; will kick in and then we can all hold hands and sing &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221;. Remember folks, &#8220;diversity is our strength!&#8221; And it&rsquo;s &#8220;doubleplusgood&#8221;. Big Brother says so.</p>

		<p>I have personally witnessed the utter corruption of people from southeast Asia.  They will smile and seem all proper, and then you come to find that they tampered with records, rigged the system and sometimes blatantly stole funds through shell game accounting.  I have seen this with my own eyes well over a dozen times in a place I used to work that had many such people working there, and I walked away amazed with the brazeness.  Even when they&rsquo;re caught red handed, they get fiesty and act like you&rsquo;ve done something wrong in catching them!</p>

<p>This seems to be cultural, but it affects many white nations too, including former Soviet Bloc nations and former Yugoslavia.  But in the news today is China&rsquo;s latest; 200 Chinese commercial pilots faked their experience.  Imagine being in a plane flown by a fake pilot.  <br>

<p>To compare Nick Griffin and the BNP with the Third World political criminals who are rampant in the UK with their vote-rigging is an absolute lie with absolutely no proof whatsoever. THe BNP accounts have been praised by the government auditor himself as being the best managed of any political party in the UK. Drop your anonymity and show your face if you are going to make accusations like that.<br>
