<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/3/scandal-at-justice-enabling-vote-fraud/">Scandal at Justice: Enabling Vote Fraud</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Washington Times, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The biggest scandal emerging from the infamous New Black Panther voter-intimidation case {snip} came when whistleblowing attorney J. Christian Adams told the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that top Justice Department official Julie Fernandes had openly refused to enforce laws that require states to remove ineligible names  &mdash;  dead people, felons, people who have moved  &mdash;  from voter rolls. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have no interest in enforcing this provision of the law,&#8221; Ms. Fernandes reportedly told a roomful of employees of the department&rsquo;s Voting Section in November. &#8220;It has nothing to do with increasing turnout, and we are just not going to do it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now comes Mr. Adams to show this wasn&rsquo;t idle talk. As early as today, 16 states will start receiving official &#8220;notice letters&#8221; from him warning of coming private-action lawsuits to compel them to enforce these particular provisions of the law. This appears to mean that the Justice Department is refusing to make states comply with federal voter-verification laws {snip}.</p>
<p>The evidence adduced by Mr. Adams, who resigned in protest from the Obama Justice Department, is so stark as to beg the question of how the department could miss it other than by deliberately, lawlessly ignoring it. {snip} </p>
<p>Mr. Adams&rsquo; notice letters report that South Dakota, for example, has 17 counties with more registered voters than there are citizens of voting age living there. Mississippi has 17 such counties. Alabama has seven, and Indiana, Kentucky and Texas have 12 each. Most of the states threatened with suits have reported no cleaning of their voter lists for years. Multiple press accounts in Tennessee show a serious problem with convicted felons and illegal immigrants being registered and sometimes voting. </p>
<p>{snip} Mr. Adams&rsquo; missives also include Freedom of Information Act requests for the lists of federal felony convictions that the federal &#8220;motor voter&#8221; law requires the Justice Department to provide to election officials in each state. The direct intent of the requirement is to enable states that ban felon voting to scrub those names from their registration lists. The implication from Mr. Adams is that the Justice Department is ignoring that part of the law, too. </p>
<p>This developing scandal of mystery voters and dead voters resurrects the story about the Justice Department&rsquo;s own website showing more substantial efforts to help felons reacquire voting privileges  &mdash;  even though the department has no statutory authority to do so  &mdash;  than to help ensure the opportunity for military personnel overseas to have their votes cast and counted on time. </p>

		<p>The CRITICAL element to being able to pull off voter fraud is having as many people as possible, dead or living, on the voter rolls.  That way, corrupt poll workers will be able to cast votes in their names after the polls close.  And nobody will really be suspicious because voter turnout can never seem to be higher than 100%.  Be suspicious of precinct boxes that take a curiously long time to arrive at their county&rsquo;s central election board.  </p>

		<p>White Humanity doesn&rsquo;t understand the vote the same way our sworn enemies do.  We aren&rsquo;t engaged in the process. We actually Trust that if we do the right thing by acting like Good Citizens, that everything will turn out for the best.  Good Citizens don&rsquo;t ask questions, protest, or draw attention to themselves for speaking out on behalf of their own people, unless you are a minority, then you get to become a hero and ever get rich off the race racket.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading plenty of history proclaiming how great we Whites were for building Western Civilization, but since we seem intent on just watching our elites get rich by giving away all our stuff to the Third World, I&rsquo;m having my doubts about the benefits of Whiteness.</p>

		<p>Well, felons are mostly black and hispanic percentage wise.  Therefore likely to vote Democratic.  Military trends to the more conservative therefore more likely to vote conservative i.e. Republican or at least less likely to vote Democratic.  Not hard to figure out.  Gore fought hard to keep military absentee votes out of the count one way or another, while ignoring reports of huge voter fraud and &#8220;found&#8221; or &#8220;misplaced&#8221; ballots as being fraudulent with names like Mickey Mouse etc.</p>

Ghosts of the 2000 presidential election.</p>
<p>The Justice Dept. clearly doesn&rsquo;t want to be accused of (or is that actively participating in) purging the voting registry of &#8216;eligible&rsquo; voters. After all, President Obama is likely to run for re-election.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it   &mdash;   the top people of the Justice Department should all be in prison.  I note that this story is an editorial in the conservative Washington Times.  I bet this news doesn&rsquo;t appear at all in the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC, CBS, or MSNBC.</p>
