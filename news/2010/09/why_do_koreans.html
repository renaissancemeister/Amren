<h1>Why Do Koreans Own the Black Beauty Supply Business?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>R. Asmerom, Atlanta Post, September 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what can explain the seemingly random attraction of Black hair to Korean entrepreneurs? Is it that they love Black hair so much? Was there a plan amongst the first wave of Korean immigrants to hone in on the black hair care industry and dominate the beauty supply store market? From a business perspective, it was no coincidence.</p>
<p>The wig business and the explosion of the wig business in South Korea in the 1960s is instrumental to understanding the Korean ownership of beauty supply stores. According to the book &#8220;On My Own: Korean Businesses and Race Relations in America&#8221;, the rise of the YH Trade wig manufacturing company was significant. Founder Yung Ho Chang, conceived the idea of the company while working as the vice-director of Korean Trade Promotion Corporation in the U.S. Between 1965 and 1978, his company exported $100 million worth of wigs.</p>
<p>The wig business was doing so well, especially amongst African-American consumers that the Korean Wig Merchants pushed to corner the market. &#8220;In 1965, the Korean Wig merchants joined together and convinced the Korean government to outlaw the export of raw hair,&#8221; said Aron Ranen, a filmmaker who has documented the marginalization of African-American entrepreneurs in the hair care industry. &#8220;[This ban] made it so that one can only buy the pre-made wigs and extensions.&#8221; In other words, Korean hair could only be manufactured in Korea. &#8220;Six months later, the United States government created a ban on any wig that contains hair from China,&#8221; effectively putting South Korea in prime position to exploit the market.</p>
<p>The business structure helped set up many Korean entrepreneurs in the sale of wigs and over the past five decades, wig stores have evolved to become full fledged beauty supply stores where hair for weaves and extensions represent the top selling products. Since then, it&rsquo;s been a chain reaction as one store beget another; family members and employees of one store owner duplicated the business. According to said Dr. Kyeyoung Park, associate professor of anthropology and Asian American Studies at UCLA, competition also played a role in the proliferation. &#8220;Korean immigrants are more concerned with peer competition,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If one is running a business so well, then another Korean will open up a similar business very quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, there are over 9,000 Korean-owned beauty supply stores serving a billion dollar market for Black hair. Between manufacturing, distributing and selling these hair care products, Korean entrepreneurs appear to control all major components. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According Ranin, there are only four central distributors serving beauty supply stores in the country and these Korean owned distributors discriminate against Black store owners in order to maintain their monopoly in the market. Ranin interviewed Lucky White, the owner of Kizure Ironworks which specializes in making styling tools like curling irons, for his 2006 documentary. Ms. White claimed that distributors told her that her products were no longer in demand as an excuse to turn away her products in favor of knock-offs produced by Asian companies.</p>
<p>Devin Robinson, an economics professor and author of &#8220;How to Become a Successful Beauty Supply Store Owner&#8221;, organized a boycott last November against Non- Black Owned Beauty Supply stores. &#8220;The problem is with the distributors.&#8221; he has stated. &#8220;Distributors are mainly Non-Blacks and they handpick who they will distribute products to. This oftentimes leaves aspiring black owners disenfranchised.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it will happen, but you can be darned sure that black leaders will:</p>
<p>#1  Find a way to blame whitey for what the Koreans are doing</p>
<p>#2  Demand special government payouts to black suppliers</p>
<p>#3  Demand more money for integrating blacks in white neighborhoods and for forcing WHITE companies to hire more black workers</p>
<p>Even though none of those remedies have anything to do with cut-throat asians cornering the market, this is just how voodoos have rolled for many decades now.  Any discriminashun - it must be whitey&rsquo;s fault!</p>

		<p>Of course beauty supply distributors &#8220;hand pick&#8221; their retailers, just as automakers hand pick their dealers.  They want good representation for their products.  It&rsquo;s that simple, and the unvarnished truth of the matter is that Koreans generally make better and more successful business people than black Africans. They&rsquo;re also far less likely to sue a distributor, alleging unfair distribution practices or &#8220;racist&#8221; policies.</p>

<p>I never cease to be amazed at what blacks get away with in this society. If this guy was white and tried to boycott a black business he would be out of his university job and deemed a &#8220;racist.&#8221; Yet because he is black he is made into a civil rights leader.</p>
<p>Something tells me blacks have a rude awakening coming up real soon in the new &#8220;diverse&#8221; Amerika.</p>

		<p>A solution would be for Americans or blacks in America to produce hair and wigs. That would take a lot of work, I bet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this points to (racist) conspiracy to establish Asians at/as the financial pinnacle of human development with black Africans at the bottom of the pit. I&rsquo;m expecting an e-mail from a Nigerian telemarketer any time now&hellip;</p>

		<p>The reason these stores are Korean-owned and not black-owned is that Koreans save their money to open up small stores, while black spend their money on hair-care products and don&rsquo;t save a dime.</p>

		<p>The pithy one-liner under the link on the newspage reads, <i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s discrimination against blacks, of course.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Not so fast there Amren. There may well be something to this one.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;In 1965, the Korean Wig merchants joined together and convinced the Korean government to outlaw the export of raw hair,&rdquo; said Aron Ranen. &ldquo;Six months later, the United States government created a ban on any wig that contains hair from China,&rdquo; effectively putting South Korea in prime position to exploit the market.</i></p>
<p>Why would the US ban hair from China? It should be pretty obvious that some money changed hands on that one. If it weren&rsquo;t for those two laws getting passed in Korea and the US so close together I&rsquo;d say it was just more black paranoia. But considering the laws and that Koreans dominate every link in the chain I&rsquo;d say there is a de facto monopoly at work.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the recent article in Al Arabiya about a town in the Canadian arctic which had 80 Muslim residents.  </p>
<p>The reason they are in the remote arctic is because of their dominance of certain small businesses, like taxis and fast food. Like the Koreans, they spread from town to town, duplicating the success of earlier immigrants of their ethnic community.</p>
<p>A Canadian example of note would be the Lebanese, who began coming to Canada 40 years ago following the Greek post-war migration. They bought pizzarias, locksmith shops, and taxi licenses from white owners.  As later waves of brothers and cousins arrived, they spread to outlying towns, taking advantage of family controlled distribution networks. </p>
<p>The sudden economic booms of the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s made many of them extremely wealthy, and they took advantage of their Middle East connections to dabble in drug importing and money laundering (&#8220;the Lebanese Mafia&#8221;), while undercutting Canadian labour by hiring desparate Muslims from poorer regions in work-for-citizenship schemes.</p>
<p>Today, more than 20,000 Lebanese living in Lebanon have Canadian citizenship (many are retirees receiving Canadian old age benefits).  A half million more currently reside in Canada. They are a striking example of an aggressive invader, using concentration of ethnic insularity to enrich themselves, at the expense of passive host.</p>

<p>Liberals always have to invent the most convoluted &#8220;explanations&#8221; for simple phenomena! </p>
<p>The true explanations are, in accordance with Occam&rsquo;s Razor, far more likely to be simply that blacks don&rsquo;t tend to make good entrepreneurs and blacks don&rsquo;t tend to patronize black-owned businesses.</p>

<p>And today&rsquo;s &#8220;Question of the Day&#8221; is&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;Why Do Koreans Own the Black Beauty Supply Business?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t even need to read the article to be able to answer that one. </p>
<p>Koreans own the black beauty supply business for the same reason Koreans own just about every other business in the ghetto: because Asians are smart, hard working, and still new enough as an immigrant group to be willing to put up with an endless parade of annoying and/or dangerous black customers. </p>
<p>And   &mdash;   this is equally important   &mdash;   because the blacks show no signs of being willing to do this kind of thing themselves. Not even for their own racial niche market. They have pretty close no &#8220;drive&#8221;, and no business acumen, at all. They are the least entrepreneurial bunch of people on the planet. They will literally starve to death before undertaking some sort of capitalist enterprise, however minuscule. </p>
<p>(Unless you count drug dealing and other illegal enterprises. Which you shouldn&rsquo;t, because they&rsquo;re illegal.)</p>
<p>Some 20 years ago, Spike Lee&rsquo;s movie &#8220;Do The Right Thing&#8221; featured a scene where Bed-Stuy black males discuss why it is that Koreans fresh off the boat own all the corner stores in Brooklyn (and every other ghetto in America, for that matter). The group&rsquo;s attitude is, predictably, &#8220;Them Ko-Reans come into OUR &#8216;hoods and take over all OUR businesses!&#8221; But   &mdash;   in a rare moment of intelligence and candor in a Spike Lee film   &mdash;   one of the older, more sensible blacks counters this view by reminding the others that ANY of these whining black locals could themselves have been proud and successful African-American business owners &#8220;in da commune-i-tee&#8221; IF they&rsquo;d made the investments, taken the risks, put in the hours, etc, that the Koreans have. IF, that is, they&rsquo;d got off their black duffs and DONE SOMETHING with their lives. </p>
<p>So, to reiterate a point that really shouldn&rsquo;t need reiterating: <i>Some folks gots it, some folks don&rsquo;t gots it.</i></p>

		<p>Three things struck me about the article:</p>
<p>1) The other day I needed a squeeze bottle to put some oil into a differential (seriously!). Not having much time, I went to the beauty supply store in my &#8220;vibrant&#8221; neighborhood to get the kind of bottle used to apply hair color. I was startled to see that the merchant behind the counter was a male oriental immigrant (no doubt Korean). I don&rsquo;t know why, but I had expected a black woman because it was obviously a store that catered to blacks. I should have known better.</p>
<p>2) So Koreans are clannish in their business practices? No surprise there, really.</p>
<p>3) Black women covet oriental hair. Who knew? </p>
<p>As an aside, Thomas Sowell has pointed out the common suspicion of &#8220;middleman minorities,&#8221; from Koreans to Indians in Africa, Chinese in Southeast Asia, and of course Jews the world over. That comes through in this article.</p>

Good heavens. These people do obsess about hair care.</p>
<p>Again, the excessive use of the word &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221;. Do blacks learn one new word per decade?</p>
<p>This is an example of 1) blacks blaming others for their lack of effort, 2) failure of blacks to network through businesses, 3) lack of black support of black business.</p>
<p>If blacks were a people who weren&rsquo;t so easily ticked-off at the smallest perceived faux pas, they would be able to do what they alleged the Koreans of doing; working together for their own benefit.</p>
<p>Black unity is a myth. The civil rights movement wasn&rsquo;t a black momement. The civil rights movement was facilitated with the help of whites and the acquiescence of white leaders. Once blacks are left on their own, unity ceases. </p>

		<p>Apparently the reason Koreans dominate the black beauty supply business is because Koreans have straight dark hair and American black women want straight dark hair (a blonde wig would fool no one).  For having established a niche in this nefarious way their businesses must now be boycotted, organized by an economics professor no less.</p>
<p>No prizes for guessing the race of economist Devin Robinson: <a href="https://www.devinrobinson.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.devinrobinson.com/</a></p>
<p>Imagine if whites boycotted a business because it was run by blacks.  There would be universal condemnation across the entire spectrum of the mass media, and the Feds would file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that the success of the Korean black beauty products businessmen is also due to the Koreans&rsquo; fierce loyalty to their own people.  I don&rsquo;t blame them for that.  I do wish whites would start showing some loyalty to <i>their</i> own people.</p>

<p>And some work even more so. Those that enter the country as an indentured servant work 12 hours a day, seven  days a week for seven years to pay off the debt they owe the snake head. And all the while saving half of the minimum wage that they are paid. After seven years they actually have a nest egg at their disposal to start a business where they continue to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week for the rest of the their life. Of all the groups in America that can be identified as a a group, the Chinese are the wealthiest. Live very cheaply, are willing to do so and save a lot of money!</p>

		<p>Here in New Orleans where I live, almost every single one of the dumpy corner grocery stores one finds in all neighborhoods throughout the city is owned by either Vietnamese, Indians/Pakis, or Arabs, in that order, with but a few, tiny exceptions. (One example of the exception: Here in the French Quarter, there is a small grocery on the corner of Saint Phillip St. and Dumaine St. owned by 4th generation Italian-American types, but as though to prove my point, the name of the grocery is &#8220;Matassa&rsquo;s&#8221; [I always get it wrong and refer to it as &#8220;Madrassa&rsquo;s&#8221;]). </p>
<p>tinyurl.com/2d73rjq</p>
<p>In what has to be upwards of 95% of the cases though, the stores&rsquo; owners here are invariably foreign-born, speaking with heavy accents and being barely able to communicate reasonably in the official language of the USA. </p>
<p>A lot of times you&rsquo;ll find a Vietnamese store owned and operated by middle-age Vietnamese nationals, but whose school-aged, Americanized children operate the register on occasion. (Those 2nd generation Vietnamese youths speak flawless public-school English, for the most part, but often there a few - the older brothers in particular of the large Viet brood -  whose speech is heavily tainted by ghetto influences). [Nothing funnier {stranger?} than a scrawny 120-pound Vietnamese kid talking ghetto]. </p>
<p>These corner stores are of course on the periphery of the large chain supermarkets such as Rouses, Whole Foods (there are two large WFs in New Orleans), and of course Wal Mart - including the gigantic Lower Garden District Wal Mart by Jackson Avenue and the Mississippi River that was famously featured in the news during Hurricane Katrina as the scene of widespread looting by locals and NOPD officers alike.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy for the purposes of this post, is that in heavily black neighborhoods, where the clientele of these foreign-born establishments is of course 99% black, it is truly an unnatural and anachronistic sight to behold poor welfare blacks who have for generations lived within just a few blocks of &#8220;Dat&rsquo;s Market&#8221; or &#8220;Trong&rsquo;s Discount,&#8221;  proffering their &#8220;Louisiana Purchase&#8221; welfare debit cards to the 98-pound Saigon-born shopkeeper behind the counter. </p>
<p>Before discovering Amren, I used to wonder why there were so many foreign-owned corner stores in predominantly black neighborhoods throughout all of New Orleans. Why, I wondered, were not these corner establishments owned by the same blacks who patronized them? Surely I thought there had to be government programs to encourage black ownership of corner stores in all-black neighborhoods? Why does every corner store and seemingly every gas station in this city have to be owned and operated by foreign-born people from the Third World? </p>
<p>It all seemed so strange to me just a few years ago. </p>
<p>Today, obviously, the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, and we all know the truth behind these ominous demographic transformation trends happening not just in New Orleans, but indeed throughout the entire Western World.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Why Do Koreans Own the Black Beauty Supply Business?&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just Koreans that own so many businesses in black communities.  Many immigrants from other countries do.</p>
<p>Blacks have less ability and intelligence than any other race in America today.  It doesn&rsquo;t take any creativity, planning, strategy or intelligence to buy dope and turn around and sell it, but it does take all those abilities and more to put together a legitimate business and run it properly.</p>
<p>The lefty loonies just hate to admmit it, but blacks cannot compete in a first world nation. That&rsquo;s why they scream so much about racism causing them to fail and creating outrageous injustices.  If they didn&rsquo;t have non-existent racism to blame, they would have to accept that they are incompetent, and they&rsquo;re MUCH too arrogant to ever do that. They&rsquo;d start a riot first.</p>

<p>I just had a vision: I&rsquo;m shopping in a department store while a nearby crowd of black women are buying wigs. One of them looks at the box and asks aloud &#8220;YH Trade? What does that stand for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yung Ho&#8221; I reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!? she screams. The fists fly as they all join in&hellip;</p>

		<p>Wow. I mean really, just wow. Read the entire article from the link including comments and it was a real eye-opener. Just from the comments you get the pulse and true feeling of how black america thinks sometimes. Granted, there were a few Thomas Sowell inspired comments but taken as a whole they were all in the generalized &#8220;poor,poor me&#8221; fashion. Seriously, how long can one race keep this pathetic blame game going? All things required for success (hard work, intelligence,patience) are totally lacking in black america. To continue this charade of pushing blame and victomization only lowers the view of them even more.</p>

		<p>This is a harbinger of things to come.  While blacks are focused on blaming whites for all social ills, other ethnic and racial are not encumbered by guilt, the law, or a sense of the others entitlement.  The other ethnic groups are competitive and commercially oriented.  And they will go to lesser neighborhoods to gain an economic foothold crowding out the self-entitled lesser competitors.  Blacks can continue to play the game they have for the past several decades of blaming whitey and demanding favored treatment.  But the new immigrants are the ones that are the biggest growing threat to blacks way-of-life and they have no sympathy with the black plight.  Proof?  When was the last time you saw black restaurant help?  Black fruit/veg store?  Black nail salon?  The engineering and medical grad schools have an abundance of qualified students while blacks require affirmative action to get in.  And those non-black students have gotten to those grad schools in one generation from when their parents (legally) immigrated here.</p>

		<p>  Yes, Korean wigs would be made from &#8220;good hair.&#8221;  Soft, straight black or &ldquo;processed&rdquo; hair is considered &#8220;good hair&#8221; by many Southern blacks. Some say, it is the blacks internalizing the racism of their oppressors, but regardless of how you look at it, it&rsquo;s been going on a long time. Maybe, it goes back to the old Louisiana Quadroon/Octoroon balls where the rich Creole men would choose their young mistresses. Usually the light skinned mistress would be given a little house and maybe a small seamstress business. Most of these white looking women would have been shocked if you suggested that they find an uneducated and unsophisticated black man. Dark skinned women with nappy hair were considered undesirable by most white men of means.    </p>

		<p>Yes, Koreans are hard working people but the answer lies with the SBA. In order to get a small business loan you have to have a business plan. So how do people who barely speak English manage to write up a business plan? Simple, there are non-profit organizations who do it for them. The SBA is pro-immigrant and anti-White. </p>
<p>This explains why there is a Mexican restaurant in an old colonial building in a nearby historic town. The only ones who could get a loan to open a business were Mexicans.  </p>

<p>The only successful black business enterprises seem to be Nigerian 419 scams, drug dealers, and prostitution rings.</p>

		<p>East Asians&rsquo; avaricious nature has been known for centuries.  Carl Linnaeus noted East Asians&rsquo; greedy behavior among other characteristics in the mid 1700s.  Because we are taught not to spot common characteristics in non-white groups otherwise be labeled racist and to work for other racial groups&rsquo; interests and not our own many do not know of East Asians&rsquo; avaricious nature and get blindsided.  </p>
<p>Koreans&rsquo; domination of the black beauty supply market is due to a combination of things.  Black people are the battering rams for diversity.  Black people sought to break down white society including the immigration laws to benefit black people but like every thing intended to help black people those that have benefited the most are East Asians.  East Asians immigrated to America and exploited the black market and have used it as a stepping stone to enter the entire American market.  There are four main reasons why East Asians were able to exploit the black market; poor work ethic, lack of trust amongst black people, black people&rsquo;s resentment and envy toward white people and East Asians&rsquo; avaricious nature.  Black people do not like jobs with consistent, grueling schedules where they have to regulate themselves.  Black people do not trust black entrepreneurs to produce quality products or services and black entrepreneurs do not trust black employees to not steal, show up on time, have pleasant attitudes, not start fights and be productive.  With all the bad behavior in the black community black entrepreneurs are forced to stay small or hire people of other races to work for them and even then almost all sell their businesses or close down because they can&rsquo;t sustain it.  Black people are resentful of white people for the subjugation of black people and are envious of white people for our history and everything we are and create.  White people especially good-looking and/or successful ones are reminders to black people of their inferiority and they don&rsquo;t want to be reminded of that so black people do everything they can to get rid of white people.  When black people push white people out of the neighborhood with their hostile behavior they turn to other groups to sustain them because they can&rsquo;t and many times that&rsquo;s East Asians.  African nations since they pushed white people out are looking to East Asians to do what white people did.  East Asians do not stir up the feelings of resentment and envy white people do because East Asians are unattractive and dull.  East Asians are avaricious.  Don&rsquo;t think that behavior can&rsquo;t be turned toward white people when it already has.  The camera industry is close to entirely East Asian.  The camera was invented by a white man and for some time the camera industry was entirely white.  East Asians are not white or honorary white.  There has never been a white-yellow alliance and never will be because East Asians don&rsquo;t see you as equals.  East Asian countries make sure their markets are so hostile to foreign companies they never enter, leave quickly or only take the smallest share.  Walmart has been bounced out of South Korea after only a few years there and has lost money nearly every year they have been in Japan.  Coca-Cola is the leading soft drink company in Japan but the soft drink market is the smallest out of all beverages by far and soft drinks are low-margin products.  The current situation is where white countries have open markets while East Asian countries have mostly closed markets.  The advantage is with East Asian companies since they don&rsquo;t have to compete in their own countries with foreign companies while white companies do.  I see white people&rsquo;s situation becoming like that of black people where white people have to rely on other races for employment and produce nothing of their own on our own.</p>

		<p>Poster #25 is saying what I&rsquo;ve been talking about for a long time.  Blacks need to wake up and smell the coffee.  Only whites care about you (white liberals, that is) and they are the only ones who will ever help you or keep the welfare going.</p>
<p>I once worked in a place that had 70% latino employees and 30% black.  When it became known, due to the gloating of the blacks, that there were some special set-asides just for them, the latinos went nuts and complained up and down about this for days while the blacks just smiled.</p>
<p>In a latino-run America (about 40 years from now) there will be no more favors for blacks.  The only hope blacks have is to join with whites and reverse the latino invasion!</p>

		<p>If I may list a few foreign companies with success in East Asia&hellip;.</p>
<p>- Apple in the portable music player market<br>
- McDonald&rsquo;s (not as dominating as they do in North America though)<br>
- German automobiles in the luxury automobile market<br>
- Nike (again, not as dominating as in North America)<br>
- Intel and NVidia<br>
- a few programs such as office software and graphic editors</p>
<p>If not otherwise indicated, the companies above are just as successful as they are in their home countries.  </p>
<p>However, like you stated, a few foreign companies doexperience difficulty in entering or staying in the market in East Asia.  </p>

		<p>To BlueBlood I think you&rsquo;re ignorant of East Asia in general given your comments:</p>
<p>&#8220;East Asian countries make sure their markets are so hostile to foreign companies they never enter, leave quickly or only take the smallest share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volkwagen is the #1 carmaker in China, which is the largest car market in the world.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/10870442/1/the-10-hottest-cars--in-china.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN" rel="nofollow">https://www.thestreet.com/story/10870442/1/the-10-hottest-cars  &mdash;  in-china.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN</a></p>
<p>&#8220;As for 2009 market share, Volkswagen was first with 17%&#8221;</p>
<p>Another claim that&rsquo;s easily disproven.<br>
&#8220;There has never been a white-yellow alliance and never will be because East Asians don&rsquo;t see you as equals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously someone hasn&rsquo;t been doing their reading on WWII.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Axis alliance, Axis nations, Axis countries, or just the Axis, comprised the countries that were opposed to the Allies during World War II.[1] The three major Axis powers &mdash; Germany, Japan, and Italy &mdash; were part of a military alliance on the signing of the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, which officially founded the Axis powers. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;African nations since they pushed white people out are looking to East Asians to do what white people did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course regarding Africa.  I think the primary problem is the way we do things in the west it&rsquo;s corporations going in and trying to deal with governments.   When the Chinese deal with an African country it&rsquo;s G to G or government to government and they have resources that and long term financing that corporations in the West don&rsquo;t have because of their quarterly earning mentality.  The Chinese government can afford to build a mine and the roads,ports and rail systems to transport those resources.</p>
<p>Here is some more reading on the subject.<br>
https://www.thebeijingaxis.com/news_list.php?cid-30-cname-knowledge.html</p>
<p>Asia in general and China in particular will be strongly engaged in world affairs.  To pretend that they&rsquo;re not and that you don&rsquo;t have to deal with is to operate irrational and in denial of reality.  </p>
<p>The key to West succeeding in the 21st century is realizing that China will alter the world and to adapt.  Adapation is the key to evolution and using a late 19th century or even mid to late 20th century world view will ultimately be the detriment of the West.  Adapt,evolve improvise.<br>

		<p>Korean kid, the portable music market is tiny.  McDonald&rsquo;s sell low-margin products like burgers for $.99.  Additionally, the fast food market is small compared to other eating arrangements.  The foreign non-East Asian car market is very small in East Asia.  Although Volkswagen is the leading car company in China right now I doubt that will continue long into the future.  The Chinese will switch to a Chinese car as soon as one doesn&rsquo;t have the stigma of being cheap anymore.  All of Nike&rsquo;s products are made in East Asia and everyone associates the products with East Asia.</p>
<p>Here are charts showing market share among various products in Japan.  Very few are foreign let alone non-East Asian.<br>

		<p>The hair Blacks covet comes from Indian Hindu devotees who are too poor to give their god anything else but their hair and they are shaved bald and the hair is sold by the temple to middlemen and eventually the hair comes into the US as hair extensions and wigs. See the movie Good Hair by Chris Rock who shows this going on.</p>

		<p>This is not a new story. Two thousand years ago, German women from the tribes along the Rhine earned good money by selling their golden tresses to the Jewish merchants who followed in the wake of the Roman armies, buying hair, amber, and slaves. This <br>
Germanic hair was highly valued in Rome where blond wigs were all the rage among fashionable patrician ladies.  Nothing new at all!  <i>Plus ça change, plus c&rsquo;est la même chose</i>&hellip;</p>

I also think that blacks that have an interest in that field open up or work at Hair Salons that have a far higher profit margins.<br>
If I were a black woman wanting to get ahead would I become a hairdresser or store owner with all of its&rsquo; hassels&hellip;.easy choice.</p>

<p>It was my knowledge that the food industry works on very thin margins, and anything not related to food industry usually works on nicer margins.  Even BlueBlood stated Coca-cola and McDonald&rsquo;s generate very small profits out of their products.  I once heard some hardware products generate profits of 100% of the original production price. </p>
<p>&#8220;would I become a hairdresser or store owner with all of its&rsquo; hassels&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Depends.  Employees in all types of service industries experience their share of hassles with having to be obedient to all types of rules set by the employer, and hassles that originate from having to deal with all types of unpleasant customers, that words can never possibly describe.  A lot of people in the service industry say there is no way to truly find out what it exactly feels like to deal with unpleasant customers day in and day out, except actually doing it.  Even doctors often deal with very disturbing patients and work schedules.  </p>
<p>And by the way this particular article is not dealing with <i>hair salons</i>.  It is dealing with <b>beauty supply equipment stores</b> that sell skin care equipments, make-up equipments, and so on.  Anyone is welcome to start a beauty supply store business with no experience or skills required of a hairdresser.  Of course, some skills or knowledge as a hairdresser might help in some situations.  </p>
