<h1><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/19/politics/main6882567.shtml">Colin Powell: Illegal Immigrants Fix My House</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS, September 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Powell, a moderate Republican, urged his party Sunday to support immigration generally because it is &#8220;what&rsquo;s keeping this country&rsquo;s lifeblood moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC&rsquo;s &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; he said a path to legal status should be offered to illegal immigrants because they &#8220;are doing things we need done in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;They&rsquo;re all over my house, doing things whenever I call for repairs, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen them at your house. We&rsquo;ve got to find a way to bring these people out of the darkness and give them some kind of status.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell did not say whether he&rsquo;s hired illegal immigrants directly or they showed up with contractors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In lamenting the party&rsquo;s rightward drift Sunday, he said Republicans must not become anti-immigration and spoke in support of legislation that would give certain children of illegal immigrants a way to become citizens if they pursue a college education or military service.</p>
<p>Immigration, he said, offers the U.S. a chance to maintain a youthful population in contrast with the aging of Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The former secretary of state said he still sees Mr. Obama as a transformational figure, if one who has lost some of his ability to connect with people.</p>

		<p>A Rush caller today made a very good point about this:  Taking this at face value, Colin Powell knows that illegal aliens are working in his house.  So it means either one of two things:  One, he knowingly hired illegal aliens, meaning he violated Federal law.  Or two, he asked tan-skinned people about their immigration status, meaning he engaged in the &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; he seems to think is a problem for Arizona et al. to do.</p>
<p>But Powell says that he doesn&rsquo;t hire illegals.  Read the fine print, and he means that he only hires the contractor, who in turn hires the illegals.  Still, I don&rsquo;t think that would fly in Federal court.  But I don&rsquo;t think Powell will have to worry about Federal charges   &mdash;   Powell endorsed Obama, after all, even as the GOP nominated a moderate/RINO of Powell&rsquo;s liking.</p>

		<p>What an ungrateful, unpatriotic, greedy, SOB!  Hundreds of thousands of American citizens are out of work, and Powell hires illegal immigrants to work on his house, so that he can save a few bucks?  Neither the elitist Democrats nor the elitist Republicans get it.  All need to be tossed out of office.</p>
<p>I pray that Powell gets fired and that his job be given to a wage-slave from Mexico or India, at 1/2 the pay.</p>

		<p>He didn&rsquo;t mention the disparate impact on White Taxpayers whose lifeblood supports the blacks in government and on welfare.</p>
<p>I distrust the so called &#8220;conservative&#8221; FoxNews, because they never show a racial breakdown of how much White Humanity pays in taxes compared to the rest of the inhabitants, nor a comparison of the per capita benefits received by our enemies. </p>
<p>Government is one big agency of transfer of wealth and privilege from White Humanity to the lower sub ethnics.  We are the lifeblood, and we must learn to tourniquet ourselves.   The coming collapse may do it for us.  You cannot indefinitely violate the iron laws of Nature .<br>

		<p>Immigration is a Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Sure, you can keep bringing in immigrants to &#8220;keep the population youthful&#8221; and inject fresh wealth into the scheme, but it is only buying time before the collapse.</p>

		<p>Follow up:</p>
<p>Our enemies know that White Humanity pays an over abundance of the taxes with our lifeblood. They know that any stimulative tax policy disproportionately helps Whites, because we pay the taxes.</p>
<p>Their idea of reform is to take away our mortgage deduction and spread the benefit more equitably so that blacks get more tax credits, thus hurting White Humanity in the process and making the dreams of Rosa Liar Parks and Michael King Fake Rev. come true:  White misery through social justice.</p>
<p>Get used to it Whitey: if you are pursuing happiness, you are a racist.  &#8220;Happiness&#8221; is code word for &#8220;unearned White privilege, which is reinforced through systemic racism and institutional bias.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Civil Rights, Social Justice, and Human Dignity and &#8220;broad-based initiatives&#8221; are the cure to your racist happiness.  Obama will see to it.</p>
<p>http://www.urban.org/publications/412099.html Abstract</p>
<p>The mortgage interest deduction (MID) is the largest single federal subsidy for owner-occupied housing, but the benefits are not evenly distributed among taxpayers. Only individuals who itemize deductions can benefit from the MID, and the value of the deduction increases with the marginal tax rate. If the government wishes to promote homeownership, a refundable tax credit available to all taxpayers would be more effective. This report presents new distributional estimates both of the current deduction&rsquo;s benefits by income group, family type, and race/ethnicity and of proposals to eliminate, scale back, or replace the MID with more broad-based tax incentives.<br>

		<p>I actually watched that interview on &#8216;meet the press&rsquo; on Sunday. The above article leaves out two other things that he said. First, in a very nonchalant and matter-of-fact way he stated that in a generation minorities will be the majority. Then he went on to say that half of minority youngsters now fail to graduate from high school. But he acted as though this alarming statistic was not a very big deal since it was only a matter of time before it would somehow, someway, just be magically whisked away. Newsflash to Colin Powell: The ancestors of blacks and Amerindians (and of course this includes a lot of Hispanics) evolved in a more temperate climate than the forebearers of Europeans and therefore it is highly likely that a larger percentage of whites posses at a greater share of the genes which regulate cognitive function. This my friends is the main culprit for the below average academic performance of minorities. So this crisis will not just magically go away and if his gleeful prediction about minority growth comes to pass, the USA will become a third-world country. How Patriotic Mr. Powell. </p>

		<p>This and his Obama vote shows that Colin Powell is really a Democrat after all.  I guess the number of bona fide black Republicans is now down to the single digits.  I don&rsquo;t mean percentages, I mean I&rsquo;d be surprised to find more than 9 in the entire country.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother Colin Powell that there are millions of unemployed blacks in this country who are perfectly capable of mowing a lawn or nailing in some shingles.  Like the rest of the elites, he just loves that cheap labor.<br>

		<p>The wretched and feckless Neo-Marxist Colin Powell is showing himself for the &#8220;conservative&#8221; of convenience he is (and always was). The Republican party is not &#8220;his party.&#8221; He is betraying himself as a notorious sleeper agent and infiltrator. </p>
<p>And leave it to a neo-Marxist like Powell to throw in both some ageism and anti-white racism with his crack that &#8220;immigration offers the U.S. a chance to maintain a youthful population,&#8221; as if the genetic stock that built this country can be easily replaced as a matter of convenience.  </p>
<p>In a sane country Powell would be thrown in jail for so brazenly breaking the law.</p>

		<p>Thank God this guy didn&rsquo;t ever become president. He was an indecisive general, and a phony conservative. It always made me laugh that a lot of people viewed him as a conservative. He&rsquo;s just an older, perhaps a little smarter, version of Obama. What a nothing he turned out to be for all of those who actually believed in him at one time. </p>
<p>Once again Powell demonstrates that anyone who puts his faith in black people thinking like them and holding the interests of the nation over their own at heart believes in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus. </p>

		<p>So these undocumenteds just magically appear at Colin&rsquo;s house?  I suggest that he do what I do.  When I call a contractor to perform repairs, I explain what work I need done.  Before agreeing to the service call, I pointedly ask, &#8220;do you employ Mexicans?&#8221;  I follow up with  &#8220;are they legal residents?&#8221;  If the response is affirmative on both counts, I ask if they can speak English. If the contractor says yes, I ask if each one that will be on the job speaks English.  If the contractor cannot convince me that his employees are legal residents and speak passable English, I tell the contractor, sorry I can&rsquo;t do business with you.</p>

Now it turns out he considers them interchangeable with third worlders, as a replacement for them. There was always less to him than met the eye.

<p>Powell did not say whether he&rsquo;s hired illegal immigrants directly or they showed up with contractors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he didn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t; however, he does make it sound as if killer bees or fire ants are crawling all over his cave, and if only he could light a fire, we would all enjoy the stinging and crawling sensations too. This once media hailed &ldquo;transmorphic&rdquo; Jamaican-mulatto buffoon playing at being a great general, is now so 1990s passé, it is barely worth commenting on. If only he would realize it himself.</p>
<p>He clings to Comrade-in-Pimp Obama, in the same way an aging and degenerate whore might to a photo of Marilyn Monroe or Madonna while justifying its current &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the gutter. His day has passed, he couldn&rsquo;t even make it in the Neo-Con/RINO graveyard that was the Bush-43 White House. </p>

Any White people that still listen to this racist need to have their heads checked. He showed his true &#8216;colors&rsquo; when he supported the muslim - race comes first. He&rsquo;s never fooled me. I&rsquo;ve always seen him as just a Je$$ie Jack$on\ Al $harpton in a uniform.

<p>The man is completely ignorant on economics and the power base that feeds this capitalist engine to keep it going.</p>
<p>He is abysmally overated as a military tactician and stratigest, and a goofball regarding what keeps things going financially, since offshoring of labor has been the greatest boost to the corporate greed mongers, and the greatest threat to the middle class in this country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>If he had been in charge in Iraq and Afghanistan, US forces would have been routed long ago.  (And the MSM would have put a happy face on the entire matter.  Their boy can do no wrong, as a person of color, which they have been duped into believing.)</p>

 Sir, your contractor demands of you probably 25-40 an hour, then turns around and pays his unskilleed labor 6-8 dollars an hour. My God!! That would be as stupid as paying Mark IX torpedo prices for a No. 2 pencil&hellip; Uh Wait a minute! That analogy is hitting too close to home! LOL! <br>

		<p>Some background on Colin Powell:</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an affirmative-action beneficiary in many ways. He became a general during the Carter administration because the black secretary of the army, Clifford Alexander, said there weren&rsquo;t enough black generals in the ranks.</p>
<p>From there, Reagan made the mistake of putting Powell as a token on the National Security staff. Poppy Bush elevated him to a higher position during his term. Remember the &#8220;Powell Doctrine&#8221;?? &#8220;surrounding them with overwhelming force&#8221;???? Wow, what a brilliant military commander! Then Powell was being hyped as a GOP candidate in 1996 until he put his foot in his mouth when he said he was a Rockefeller Republican.</p>
<p>Also, during that time, an article came out on how Powell, Jesse Jackson, and (I kid you not) OJ Simpson, were beneficiaries of one of the minority broadcasting licenses deal. Talk about corporate welfare.</p>
<p>And to top it off, Powell is of Jamaican descent. He&rsquo;s not an authentic black who had roots in slavery.</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. Collin Powell is a fraud and a myth who was promoted by both political parties.<br>

		<p>Yeah, I agree with what evidence file and others have written about Fox news and phoney &#8220;conservatives&rsquo; on those shows, especially the likes of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.  I remember a comment he made once about White males being out of work and he quipped, &#8220;Well, there are plenty of jobs in the U.S. Army.&#8221;  If you notice that he has these two women (blonds) on his show that he points out are experts in law, sociology, economics, &hellip;. etc.  White women have benefitted the most from Affirmative Action programs, and other such programs.  Just check out the statistics.  When given the opportunity to point out the impact these racial set-asides have had on White men they either remain silent or evade the issues.  Same with old Bill.</p>

<p>This is standard black magical thinking; &#8216;The reason blacks (and other minorities) do badly is because they&rsquo;re the minority. When they become the majority and the white man is forced to give up his racism, the black man will surpass anything the white man ever did&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We all know what happens when blacks become the majority in schools, in neighborhoods, in cities, and in nations. Despite all the history and facts to the contrary, blacks STILL believe when they become the majority, everything is going to become magically transformed.<br>

		<p>I remember when home contracting jobs were a skilled trade done by hard working white Americans with years of experience. They did high quality work that lasted. Now this work is shoddily done by inexperienced illegals who have no pride in their work.What happened?? No wonder our economy is a mess and there is high unemployment! Yet people make the insane arguement that illegals are vital to our economy. Maybe they are for picking beans, but not for taking over skilled trade jobs.</p>

		<p>We give preferential rights to minorities under the theory that in a nation of 300 million there should be sufficient qualified minorities to fill any post.  Thus the work force for any job should reflect the general population.  How is it we need to affirmative action with preferences for minorities in high level jobs but somehow at the lowest tiers we can&rsquo;t find representatives from within our own citizenry?  <br>

		<p>From Post # 26: &#8220;What happens when the oil runs out, and as a result agricultural productivity collapses, this is due to happen in the next 30 or 40 years?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse: Imagine greater Los Angeles, which currently has ~7 million people.  EACH AND EVERY DAY, 7 million pounds of food, 20 million pounds of &#8220;other commodities&#8221; such as toilet paper, tampons, &amp; tooth paste, 70 million gallons of water, and massive amounts of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity must be imported   &mdash;   as well as TV, Radio, internet, phone service, etc. Likewise, 20 million pounds of garbage and 70 million gallons of waste water must be removed from that massive urban cancer EVERY 24 HR.  Finally, the average commute into LA is 40 min, with some workers commuting 4 hrs/day.  The nearest big agriculture is 200 miles away in the Central Valley. Imagine what will happen when oil runs out!  It will make post-Katrina New Orleans look like Disneyland!</p>

		<p>One we don&rsquo;t NEED more children out country is FULL overcrowded and resources are SCARCE. The whites dont feel economically secure enough to HAVE kids most of us are worked to death. I know after 3 yrs of unemployment I&rsquo;d never ever have a kid. If thats the kind of stability this country offers to white workers. </p>
<p>We are on target to go from 300 million to 500 million in 20 years all because of illegals and their kids</p>

		<p>Once again we get the myth dragged out that Europe and Japan are dying - or already moribund - societies because of declining and ageing populations.</p>
<p>Is the Greek population today bigger or smaller today than it was a century ago? How about the Japanese?</p>
<p>Were Greece and Japan moribund societies in 1910? Or in 1890?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a badly-skewed age distribution in both societies, but both will figure out ways to cope.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of contemporary Japanese life is that from time to time one reads in the English-language press* in Japan of frenzied howls of dismay and anguish from employers&rsquo; federations demanding the importation of more &#8220;long-term trainees&#8221; from Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines. </p>
<p>The reality - of course - is that the Third World &#8220;trainees&#8221; the employers already have working for them are treated like serfs, frequently find themselves obliged to work brutally long hours in dirty and often dangerous conditions and are usually, by a variety of dodges, paid less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Does anyone find any of that in the least surprising?</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that Colin Powell&rsquo;s ascent up the ladder of success was very much a matter of ability. But luck &mdash; or something &mdash; also played a role. Powell&rsquo;s commanding officer at Fort Carson, Maj. Gen. John Hudachek, wrote a very critical evaluation of Powell, claiming he was a poor leader, which would have been a dead end for most military officers. However, salvation appeared in the form of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who arrived just in time. Powell was reassigned to Washington, and, as the story line goes, the rest is history. In less than a decade, he had gone from colonel to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. </p>

<p>I remember during the first Bush term, Limbaugh basically refused to discuss illegal immigration.  He only came out strongly against it when the pressure from his listeners reached a fever pitch.  I&rsquo;m sure he has had illegal aliens work for him too.  </p>

<p>I wonder if some studies have been done that examine the effect lower or no immigration would have on the economy, seeing as we constantly hear how essential they are.  In the short term I imagine prices would rise, but the higher prices would, unlike today, be going into the pockets of non-immigrants, who would spend their money. Certain industries that rely heavily on illegal labor would likely disappear, such as certain agricultural sectors, since it would be cheaper to import. But the oft-repeated mantra of foreigners &#8220;doing the work Americans are unwilling to do&#8221; is incomplete: Americans would be willing to do menial or manual work for the right wage, just as they did before mass immigration.  It would mean a restructuring of the economy however.</p>

So, Colin, it&rsquo;s OK to use the term &ldquo;these people&rdquo;, is it?</i></p>
<p>Just checking.</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s kind of a grey area, but FWIW here&rsquo;s what I know. Last memo I got from the NAACP said it&rsquo;s OK to use the term &ldquo;these people&rdquo; but not the term &ldquo;those people.&rdquo; And also that it was OK to use the term &ldquo;your people&rdquo; but not the term &ldquo;you people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t take all this just on my say-so. You better check their site for the latest list of Approved Wordings, as the rules about this stuff are always changing. You know how these people are. </p>

<p>&#8220;And to top it off, Powell is of Jamaican descent. He&rsquo;s not an authentic black who had roots in slavery.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just how is it that you think black folks came to be in Jamaica?</p>
<p><br>
But regarding the article, this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all.  The establishment loves undocumented criminal aliens.  When people don&rsquo;t have real Social Security or worker ID numbers you don&rsquo;t have to pay them the mandated-by-law minimum wage that drove so many of the underclass people who used to do this work onto welfare.  </p>
<p>Politicians realized a problem, because why would people work for peanuts when they hand out peanuts for free at the welfare office?  And how are we supposed to repeal the minimum wage and welfare?  No leftist would ever receive a vote in this country again.</p>
<p>Eureka!  We&rsquo;ll just let the mestizos jump the border and work off the books!  That way, we can keep all the blacks and dumb lazy whites on welfare, leave the minimum wage in place to ensure the lower classes remain unprofitable as employees, therefore making sure they remain unempowered and voting for their handouts, and we can still have someone around to do our yard work!</p>
