<h1>Aussie Ad Slammed for Insulting Black U.S. Players</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox Sports, September 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Australian TV commercial has been slammed for its portrayal of black American basketball players as bed-hopping womanizers, The Courier-Mail reported Saturday.</p>
<p>The ad is set in the confines of a house, and begins with Australia national team guard Adam Gibson sliding across a breakfast table scattering bowls, while a chandelier is shattered by a ball.</p>
<p>It finishes with new Sydney Kings recruit Taj McCullough catching the ball and dishing off a pass as he lands between a white couple under the covers in bed.</p>
<p>He turns his back on the man and flashes an amorous glance at the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;After what black American players have put into the league from the start in 1979, being stereotyped in that image is inappropriate and below the belt, pardon the pun,&#8221; said former player Cal Bruton, a 1985 Brisbane Bullets title-winner who represented Australia after becoming naturalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only black American seen in the clip is hopping into bed with a white couple and what does that have to do with basketball?&#8221; [said Cal Bruton, a 1985 Brisbane Bullets player].</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former Sydney Kings player Bryant Matthews  &mdash;  an American import  &mdash;  spent time in jail for sexual assault when he was an unwanted third person in bed with a couple in Sydney in 2006.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder Australians might not like black Americans?  Yankel Rosenbaum, the Jewish victim of the black Crown Heights riots in NYC in 1991, was Australian.</p>
<p>When the Summer Olympics was held in Sydney in 2000, a chatroom buddy of mine, a native of Sydney&rsquo;s western suburbs and now a resident of Nowra, NSW, informed me that black American Olympians were up to a lot of no good in and around Sydney.  That the media didn&rsquo;t report, so that doesn&rsquo;t even count the showboating and hotdogging on the track that &#8220;our&#8221; black track athletes engaged in, that the media here did show.</p>

		<p>&#8220;An Australian TV commercial has been slammed for its portrayal of black American basketball players as bed-hopping womanizers&#8221;</p>
<p>They had a whole program on TV about this subject. Those NBA players are adored by a certain type of white female. These NBA players greatly take advantage of the situation and are just that, &#8220;bed-hopping womanizers&#8221;. The worst possible ones actually. And the bed-hopping is almost always exclusively restricted to compliant white females. Lots of disease for the team doctors to contend with as well. Nice!</p>
<p>And if you are an Aussie and read this, you are so lucky to have this American bloke now naturalized and one of you now. He has contributed so much to the Aussie game. I am sure.</p>

		<p>I have grown to hate basketball. It&rsquo;s nothing but a showcase of Black thuggery and depravity. Same for el futbol Americano. Does Australia really need to import these mayates? Aren&rsquo;t they having enough problems with the Middle Eastern Muslims?  What is this death wish that these White people universally carry with them? To steal a line from Duran Duran..<br/>
&#8220;Will someone please explain the reason for this strange behaviour?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Use to have a friend(former), 34 y.o. attractive white woman with a half black daughter from a black crack smoking jerk that never contributed a dime to her support. This woman&rsquo;s favorite sport is-you guessed it!-basketball! This so-called college educated woman would defend the actons of the black NBA players, saying &#8220;people are just jealous that they make so much money, why are people such haters?, blah,blah,blah&#8221;. She&rsquo;s a prime example of what&rsquo;s happening around the world. White people who betray their own race, and then defend the worst black behavior. I couldn&rsquo;t get away from her fast enough.</p>

		<p>I actually agree with Mr. Bruton&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white and I will never &#8216;spend&rsquo; a single night of my life watching a bunch of oversized kids dribble a ball from one hoop to another.  Over and over and over.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a race/sports defense thing here at all.</p>
<p>But if the law took care of Matthews and the imagery is disgusting on it&rsquo;s face (degenerate woman gets drunk in public with her later attacker and then has sex with a man in team owned apartment with three other guys potentially present as witnesses), it should not be aired as a means of sotto voce` impugning the reputation of black players or basketball in general.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like blacks or black criminality or black culture or black effects on original white sports/culture, that&rsquo;s fine by me too.</p>
<p>BUT SAY IT OUT LOUD.</p>
<p>And back it up with facts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t commercialize it, literally, because that devalues the subject as much as the viewer.  Sure, the mockery relieves social tension but that&rsquo;s not a good thing because, like all safety valve mechanisms it doesn&rsquo;t deal with the reality of destructive behaviors that render the races mutually incompatible.</p>
<p>This tabloid stuff is like a made for TV movie where the chaw spittin&rsquo; southern redneck walks away from a fight with the designated hero, having just enough moxy to whisper the N-word in retreat.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sucker punch us all for that kind of a coward&rsquo;s label.</p>

<p>Cid - - I am the same way.</p>
<p>And it says a lot about me too. When I was a kid, I saw an ad in the paper to see the Globetrotters at the Chicago Stadium. Begged my mother in the worse way possible to go see the game but I was not allowed to go [good thing too, might have gotten killed just traveling to the stadium]. Today, you could not pay me to go see the Globetrotters. I do not want to see those foolish antics of the Bantu on the court that so amuse the crowd, the demeaning white Washington Generals paid to lose, etc. NO LONGER would I EVER want to see the &#8220;Trotters&#8221; play.</p>

		<p>Black US players aren&rsquo;t insulted, the ultra liberal media is. And afraid to report the truth. As long as these &#8220;athletes&#8221; get paid, they could care less. Blacks, athletes or not, commit more crime than any other race on this planet.</p>
<p>If I may digress a moment, this is a headline I read today: Gators Have Lots Of Wins-And Way Too Many Arrests: 59 wins. Two national titles. Thirty players arrested. </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make this stuff up. And the picture of the current arrestee? Black. Like most of the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of the FL Gators football team who have been arrested. Which is not to say that I&rsquo;ve seen all 30, but like most of the news reporting they fail to break it down by race. But they did by victories! 30 arrests within 59 victories.</p>
<p>So I hope ads, like the Aussie ad, continue to get made. We need the comic relief! </p>
