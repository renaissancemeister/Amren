<h1><a href="/ar/1995/09/index.html#cover">The War With Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erik Peterson, American Renaissance, September 1995</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>April 25, 1996 will mark the 150th anniversary of the outbreak of the Mexican War. Today, most Americans have been taught that it was an imperialistic war of aggression, and Mexicans cite the &#8220;illegal seizure&#8221; of their territories to justify the current colonization of the American Southwest. In fact, by contemporary and even by today&rsquo;s standards, the war was far from unjustified.</p>
<p>The conflict began with Texas. When the colony of New Spain broke free from its European namesake in 1821 and christened itself Mexico, it inherited vast lands north of the Rio Grande that had been only nominally under Spanish control. Texas was a remote wilderness, constantly terrorized by Commanches, with a Mexican population of only 3,500.</p>
<p>Mexico could have concentrated on subduing the Indians and settling its northern territories. Instead, almost from the first days of independence, the country was wracked by a series of political upheavals. The small, predominantly white, Spanish-speaking elite consumed all of its energies in fratricidal power struggles, while the Mestizo and Indian majority remained mired in poverty.</p>

</div><p>In order to legitimize its claim on Texas, Mexico needed to occupy it. Since it was unable to do this itself, the Mexican government enlisted the help of immigration agents or <i>empresarios</i> to recruit settlers from the United States. The <i>empresarios,</i> chief among them Steven F. Austin, acted as representatives of the Mexican government. They were authorized to offer immigrants cheap land in return for accepting Mexican citizenship and converting to Roman Catholicism. The Americans appear to have made a good faith effort to fulfill the first requirement but often sidestepped the second.</p>

</table><p>The new settlers created a frontier version of the plantation-based, slave-owning society of the neighboring Southern states. By the early 1830s, however, Mexico began to fear that the <i>empresarios</i> had been too successful: American immigrants outnumbered Mexicans four to one, and seemed likely to identify with the land of their birth.</p>
<p>General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna became President of Mexico in 1833, and in 1835 abrogated the constitution and declared himself dictator. This act alone provoked rebellion in seven Mexican states, including Texas, but Texans had additional reasons for discontent. Determined to reverse the Americanization of the territory, Santa Anna had decreed an end to American immigration, abolished slavery, repealed the local political autonomy Texans had enjoyed, and announced he would forcibly settle the land with Mexican convicts.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine policies better calculated to rouse the ire of free-spirited Texans. In 1836 they overthrew local Mexican garrisons and declared independence. Santa Anna promptly invaded Texas with an army of 3,000 men, but after several engagements was decisively beaten by Sam Houston&rsquo;s men at the battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was captured, and in order to gain freedom agreed to recognize Texan independence, with the Rio Grande as its border. He later disavowed this treaty, and Mexico waged a nine-year guerrilla war against its former territory.</p>
<p>The United States recognized Texas as an independent republic in 1837, and recognition soon followed from France, Great Britain, Holland, and Belgium. Despite strong Texan sentiment to join the Union, the American government demurred; Mexico threatened war if Texas were annexed, and the United States was unwilling to upset the delicate balance between slave and free states.</p>
<p><b>Western Destiny</b></p>
<p>The presidential election of 1844 brought into office a firm believer in what soon became known as &#8220;manifest destiny.&#8221; James K. Polk was determined to complete the annexation of Texas, buy California from the Mexicans, and bluff the British into ceding the better part of Oregon. The Texans were impatient for a settlement, and Polk&rsquo;s predecessor, John Tyler, had welcomed the Lone Star State into the Union three days before he left office. If the United States had continued to hesitate because of Mexican sentiments, Texas might have remained independent or even accepted protectorate status from Britain or France.</p>
<p>As for California, Mexico&rsquo;s position was so weak it was bound to be supplanted soon, if not by the U.S. then by Britain, Russia, or perhaps even the Mormons. Polk had reason to believe that Mexico would be willing to sell. In the meantime, if Oregon joined the Union the careful balance of free and slave states could be maintained.</p>
<p>When Texas joined the United States in March 1845, Mexico immediately broke off diplomatic relations and threatened war. Polk sent General Zachary Taylor with 2,000 men to protect the new state from Mexican depredation while annexation was accomplished. Nevertheless, Polk had every reason to seek a diplomatic solution with Mexico, partly because he was afraid war might break out with Britain over the Oregon question. He decided to send a special emissary, John Slidell, to Mexico with instructions to resolve all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>On the question that had caused the rupture  &mdash;  annexation of Texas  &mdash;  Slidell was not to compromise. Mexico had been unable to reconquer her wayward territory, whose independence had been recognized by the major powers. By refusing to accept the loss of Texas and by persisting in border skirmishes, Mexico had perpetuated a crisis on the American border that could have led to European intervention. Texas was now part of the United States.</p>

</div><p>Several other matters were open to negotiation. One was the settlement of $3.25 million in claims by Americans on the Mexican government. Mexico had recognized these claims under international arbitration, but had later refused to pay. Another issue was final determination of the Texas-Mexico border. As a Mexican territory, the Texas border had been at the Nueces River, but after their revolution the Texans claimed the Rio Grande as the border  &mdash;  without, however, establishing full authority in the disputed territory. Slidell was authorized to release Mexico from the $3.25 million obligation in return for recognition of the Rio Grande border. This was a reasonable offer, especially since Mexico had already, in effect, declared war, and unpaid international obligations were then considered grounds for belligerency. By accepting this offer, Mexico could easily have avoided war.</p>
<p>Besides these immediate questions, Slidell was to offer $15 million but, if necessary, propose considerably more for the Mexican lands stretching from Texas to the Pacific. If the entire tract was not for sale, he was to offer $5 million for New Mexico.</p>

</table><p>The Mexican government, threatened by a militant opposition and wracked by internal dissension, refused even to receive Slidell. This was a fatal mistake. The rebuff left Polk with no means to negotiate a peaceful settlement. He ordered Zachary Taylor into the disputed region between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, but he warned Taylor not to seek engagement with any Mexican troops he might encounter. In the meantime, he made preparations to ask Congress to declare war, but Mexico forced the issue.</p>
<p>On April 23, 1846, sixteen hundred Mexican troops crossed the Rio Grande. Two days later they ambushed a U.S. Army patrol, inflicting sixteen casualties and taking prisoners. Mexico &#8220;shed American blood upon American soil,&#8221; and the war began.</p>
<p>The Mexicans, of course, saw the war as a just effort to retake what was rightfully theirs. Why, though, would they make war on the United States when they had been unable to subdue a breakaway territory? Astonishingly enough, Mexico fully expected to win. It had a standing army of 27,000 men versus an American army of only 7,200. French advisors to the Mexican army had an exaggerated estimate of its fighting prowess, which the Mexicans gladly believed. The generals intended not only to take back Texas but to annex parts of the United States. Indeed, the Mexican dictator of the moment, General Mariano Paredes, boasted that he would not negotiate <em>ntil the Mexican flag flew over the capitol dome in Washington.</em> The Mexicans were also counting on diplomatic and even military support from Britain, but the Oregon issue was resolved just before they attacked.</p>
<p>In his two-volume work, <cite>The War With Mexico,</cite> Pulitzer prize-winning historian Justin H. Smith described the war fever among the generals: &#8220;Mexico wanted [war]; Mexico threatened it, Mexico issued orders to wage it.&#8221; By no stretch of the imagination was Mexico thrust into an unwanted war by Yankee aggressors.</p>
<p><b>American Arms</b></p>
<p>The military history of the Mexican War makes interesting reading and is a credit to the tradition of American arms.</p>

</table><p>Throughout the two-year campaign, small but superbly led and highly motivated American units consistently outfought the Mexicans. The Mexican army, impressive enough in numbers and parade-ground panache, was utterly unable to fight a determined adversary.</p>
<p>The American war effort was not all glorious. Although the Regular Army behaved with proper discipline, some of the volunteer militia units conducted themselves so badly they created guerrilla resistance among previously noncombatant Mexican civilians. Also, the war was all-too-effective training for America&rsquo;s fratricidal tragedy just 13 years later. Among the junior officers sent to Mexico, 200 would go on to be generals in the Union and Confederate armies.</p>

		<p>I recommend J.T. Fehrenbach&rsquo;s &#8220;Lone Star&#8221; for a good racial history of Texas. By racial I mean he covers all groups: Germans versus Anglo-Celtic, Amerind, Spanish, and shows how their cultural values both clashed and meshed to make modern Texas. He has good coverage of the War of Mexican Aggression as well.</p>

		<p>Why if the U.S. was reputed to be so aggressive and imperialistic did the U.S. just a few years after the war ended buy the Gadsden Purchase? Why not just seize a small and trivial and unimportant speck of land?</p>
<p>And at the same time the various other territorial issues fermented as well? California in some areas claimed by the Russians [the Russian river!] and the Oregon Territory by Britain. Negotiations and settlement proved successful with the English and Russians but not with the Mexicans in 1848.</p>
<p>Santa Ana too was a brute and largely to blame for American attitudes towards Mexico? Perpetrated atrocity against his own people as well as Americans.</p>
<p>The Rio Grande is a natural border between the U.S. and Mex? All is well that ends well in that regard! Those Mexicans living in Texas prior to 1836 were not even really Mexicans. Whitey settlers from the Canary Islands and not totally dissimilar from the Texicans?</p>

<p>Exactly.  We, as the total victors, and the Mexicans totally defeated,  we were in a position to take what we pleased.  There was no need to pay for anything. The Gadsden Purchase was unpopulated desert that no one cared about. (But we needed it for the Pacific railroad.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that we actually had possession of Baja California, but gave it back, as we didn&rsquo;t think it would ever be of any value. We didn&rsquo;t have to do that. (That was a bad error!)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting too that the dictator Santa Ana was a venal scoundel, as corrupt as they come. He got thrown out of Mexico several times.  He actually ended up living in New York City!</p>

		<p>No one really owns land, you are either strong enough to hold onto it or you are not. </p>
<p>How did Mexico get control of the land, they got it from the King of Spain. How did the King of Spain get control of the land, well he got it because the Pope said it was his and he had enough soldiers to back it up. </p>
<p>At one time the whole of the new world belonged either to Spain or Portugal because they were Catholic and the Pope gave them the right to divide up the new world. </p>
<p>The only problem with this reasoning is just who the heck gave the Pope the right to decide who owns what. </p>
<p>American is a great country but sooner or later it will be populated by the Spanish and owned by the Chinese. That should be interesting. </p>

		<p>A big real problem is that people won&rsquo;t study history and so others are constantly attempting to rewrite it to favor whatever stand they take on an issue.<br>
 Mexicans are taught from a very young age that America took all the border states by force from literally millions of Mexicans that lived there at the time. So when they walk across the border,they&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong in their minds. Simply taking back what is rightfully theirs.<br>
 I had the privilege of speaking to Germans about WW II, I discovered that I knew as much, and in a lot of cases, more about Hitler than they did.They constantly told me of the good things he did; the autobahn, volkswagen, airships and putting Germans back to work. All very true.<br>
 History is constantly revised and often looked at in the light of todays values and &#8220;political correctness&#8221;. In my opinion, this is wrong.<br>
 History should be recorded factually, without emotion and never be allowed to be changed.<br>
 The argument has been made that this country will fall as a result of political correctness. Perhaps after the fall, this sickness will be eradicated and people then can rebuild itself.</p>

		<p>5-Daniel has it right. &#8220;&hellip;you are either strong enough to hold onto -land- or you are not.&#8221;  The corollary to this thought is whether or not those with the strength to hold land (a nation) also have the will to do so.  Without the will to defend a nation, the nation will certainly be taken by others.  The problem with America, and the rest of the Western nations for that matter, is that we now have a misplaced understanding of what it is we are defending. While we are &#8220;defending&#8221; against Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, we are being invaded by a population of third-world, anti-American, anti-Western Islamists and Mexicans. The end result, which will be displacment and diminishment of the White-world, will be the same as if we were attacked in a military fashion and lost.  They continue to fight the war, we do not. As such, they will win, and we will lose.</p>

		<p>Good article. The libertarians make the Mexican-American War as US aggression, but, as the article points out, the Mexicans were claiming land they did not inhabit or control.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought of the Mexican-American War as a proper war because we got something &mdash; territory. Why else fight a war?</p>
<p>But another interesting point is that we did not kill the loser, Santa Anna. That&rsquo;s because it was a war for territory. In the 20th century, we began to view wars as a clash between good (us) and evil (them) so we get to murder those we defeat. <br>

<p>Excellent article. But this  statement above is  somewhat at variance with my understanding of the circumstances. The liberal new government in Mexico assured the new Anglo settlers that they would have the right to retain their language and religion. </p>
<p>Next thing, that liberal government was overturned and the new dictator abrogated the constitution (as stated) and the religious/cultural guarantees that the  settlers had been given, requiring them to convert. </p>

		<p>This otherwise insightful article presents the major issues and chronology of the Americanization of Texas but leaves the status of the American West a little murky.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be mentioned that Spain gained control over their North American territories mainly by conquest and forceful imposition of its rule, which turned the indigenous population into subjects with few, if any, rights. On the other hand, the U.S. expanded its territories mostly by means of peaceful migration and settlements, followed by development of agriculture and infrastructure, and offered the indigenous peoples (most of whom died) a fair chance to participate in and benefit from the newly constructed country.</p>
<p>Second, the two most basic questions that need to be answered while discussing Mexican territorial claims towards the American West are:</p>
<p>1. How did exactly Mexico acquired the &#8220;rights&#8221; to these territories? Claimimg the Spanish succession doesn&rsquo;t work because Spain did not recognize Mexico and did not cede its territorial claims to it.</p>
<p>2. Even assuming (for the sake of an argument) that Mexico had valid claim rights to the Ameircan West, to what extend, if at all, did it consume these rights?</p>
<p>Here is a link to and a quotation from a short essay that addresses these:</p>
<p>https://www.geocities.com/readerswrite/commentaries/Venom_in_news.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;To make a long story short, a pope gave half of North America to Spain, which &#8220;right&#8221; (that existed, mostly, on the paper only) Mexican Empire granted to itself in 1821. In 1822, Spain deemed that self-grant, and the Empire itself, illegal, null, and void, and about one year later, Southern provinces (a.k.a. United Provinces of Central America) seceded from it. In 1824, newly proclaimed Republic of Mexico declared the Mexican Empire void (and the Emperor a traitor), too. However, the new Republic gave itself the &ldquo;right&rdquo; to all North American &ldquo;territories&rdquo; that the Empire had claimed. After several but mostly unsuccessful attempts by various governments and juntas in Mexico City (including another short-lived Emperorship) to take these &ldquo;provinces&rdquo; under control, a few revolutions of their residents against these attempts, secession of Texas in 1836, and a war lost to the U.S. in 1848, Mexico finally gave up the last of her imperial efforts to subdue former Spanish colonies and ceded to the U.S. her mostly unconsumed claims to the American Southwest, for which renouncement she took from the U.S government almost $20 million in cash.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>This is an excellent article. However, I would like to point out that several other &#8220;Mexican&#8221; states besides Texas were in revolt against Santa Ana&rsquo;s dictatorship. Santa Ana conquered all of them except Texas through mass murders of entire villages and town. Yucatan in particular revolted and declared itself a republic several times over a century or so. In fact at one point there was an alliance between the Texas Republic and Yucatan Republic. Another time Yucatan asked for annexation into the US, but was refused.</p>
<p>The history of Texas and &#8220;Mexico&#8221; is fascinating. Everyone would do well to dig into this subject.</p>

One of the things that really, really bugs me is this whole American Indians croaked (most implying heavily that we killed them).</p>
<p>That is not really true.  The indians didn&rsquo;t &#8220;die&#8221; so much as they continued to survive at the same rate they did before europeans migrated to America.  Our superior culture enabled us to survive&hellip;.better.  Over time, our population grew.  So did theirs, btw (there are far more &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; of America today, than there were back then).  We simply grew much faster than they did.  More importantly, we built civilization, where they did not.  We did not, raze cities they built, for example, and build ours on top of theirs, like conquerors.  There was no cities there in the first place.  The europeans filled a vacuum.  What they did NOT do is participate in continent wide ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>And for the most part, indians were welcome to come and go and do as they pleased (up to the limit of making war&hellip;.which a few did&hellip;.and were dealt with) and participate in the civilization we built.</p>
<p>Top to bottom, the displacement myth the left loves to spread, are nothing but lies.  The truth is the indians had low survival behaviors and little real cultural identity.  They were absorbed by us.  Willingly, for the most part.  As in most indians jumped at the chance to enjoy the luxuries and uplift available when the europeans came.</p>

<p>In actuality, millions of Indians did in fact perish shortly after being visited by Europeans, especially in the early days of Columbus and the other Spanish conquerors. However, it certainly was not our fault, despite the rantings of liberals and hippies. Rather, they died as a result of diseases that we inadvertedly brought with us to the new world. The Indians have avery low tolerance for such diseases, especially when first indtroduced to them, and so sometimes as much of 90% of the Indian population of an area was eradicated within a few decades&rsquo; time (on the island of Hispanola, for example, whih once had a native population of roughly one million). </p>
<p>Just want to emphasize again that it was not our fault, and we shouldn&rsquo;t feel guilty. White Europeans didn&rsquo;t invent small pox.</p>

<p>PBS and most on the history channel are anti-White. There isn&rsquo;t a station out there that isn&rsquo;t more sympathetic to nonwhites. It is all a part of the agenda. Most Whites think if they see it on PBS and the history channel it must be true. Right?</p>
