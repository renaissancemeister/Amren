<h1><a href="https://bidi-kwame-emmanuel.blogspot.com/">Gaddafi on &#8220;Black Europe,&#8221; Islamization Project for Black Africans: A Response</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bidi Kwame Emmanuel, Voice of Renaissance, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gaddafi, the Libyan leader and the erstwhile chairperson of the African Union (AU) landed in Italy on Sunday, and made brute racist remarks, which explicitly betrayed his gross disdain for black African people, and called to question the true intention behind his zeal for African unity.</p>
<p>Addressing the European Union (EU) in Rome, Gaddafi warned that &#8220;Europe runs the risk of turning &#8220;black&#8221; unless the EU pays Libya at least €5 billion (£4.1 billion) a year to block the arrival of illegal immigrants from Africa&#8221;. He continued, &#8220;Tomorrow Europe might no longer be European and even black as there are millions (of Africans) who want to come in. He described the migration pattern as something &#8220;very dangerous&#8221;.</p>
<p>If one analysis Gaddafi&rsquo;s statements critically, it comes out clear that he is essentially saying, &#8220;Europe, you need to protect your prestigious white identity and prevent it from being blackened by the influx of black African people&#8221;.</p>
<p>He put black Africa in a bad light by appealing to the racial prejudice of white Europeans in order to scare them to funding his fight against illegal black African migrants. It should be noted that, he not only referred to the potential risks posed by illegal immigrants as undesirable consequences but also that, black presence in Europe, whether legal or otherwise in itself, constitutes a danger to white European identity.</p>
<p>Gaddafi bolstered his dislike for black people and then projected his own racial bias on white European Christians when he further remarked, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t know what will happen, what will be the reaction of the white and Christian Europeans faced with this influx of starving and ignorant Africans&#8221;.</p>
<p>After casting slur on the &#8220;blackness&#8221; of sub-Saharan African people, he unabashedly called on Europe to open its borders to Libyan citizens, &#8220;There is also desirable immigration. There are Libyans who have money and I encourage them to come to Italy to invest.&#8221;</p>
<p>After his speech, one Italian MP, Luigi de Magistris, criticized the Libyan leader of keeping tens of thousands of African migrants in &#8220;concentration camps&#8221; in the desert, reported Telegraph, UK.</p>
<p>Gaddafi&rsquo;s blunt disrespect for black people in general, calls to question the intention behind his call for African unity. Many scholars believe Gaddafi has a hidden agenda against black Africans and that the African Union (AU) was simply a means for him to further his religious and political ambitions in sub-Saharan Africa. One such scholars, Prof. Kwesi Kwa Prah, alleged in 2004 that, Gaddafi&rsquo;s true objective in AU is to create a space for Arabism and Arab expansionism.</p>
<p>Gaddafi betrayed this sentiment at an Arab League in 2001, when he declared to the Arab Diasporas, &#8220;The third of the Arab community living outside Africa should move in with the two-thirds on the continent (Africa), and join the African Union which is the only space we have&#8221;. Readers are invited to take critical note of the expression &#8220;&hellip;the only space we have&#8221;. What was he implying exactly?</p>
<p>Broadcasting live on Rwanda Radio on 17 May 1985, Gaddafi said to Rwandans &#8220;You must teach that Islam is the religion of Africa&hellip;We must wage a holy war so that Islam may spread in Africa.&#8221;  &mdash;  quoted in [Bankie and Mchombu, 2006:239-240].</p>
<p>It came as no surprise that, in a second speech he delivered to paid Italian women on his recent visit to Rome, he declared to them, &#8220;Islam should become the religion of Europe&#8221;, and then handed them free copies of the Koran.</p>
<p>If Gaddafi is going as far as telling Europeans to adopt Islam and in effect become Islamic states governed by the Shariah, what stops him from pursuing his Arab expansionist mission in sub-Saharan Africa and its &#8220;ignorant&#8221; and &#8220;starving&#8221; masses, using his oil cash as a lure to trap some self-seeking African leaders into his deceptive trap?</p>
<p>Gaddafi must be told in the face that, black Africa has had enough from Arab and European expansionisms, which resulted in colonialism, slavery and the lost of the African identity and personality. That, black Africa is not simply a cultural vacuum to be filled by the religious doctrines of any over-zealous groups of people seeking wealth, dominance, and influence. That, black Africa fought and freed itself from shackles of colonialism long time ago and finally that, Africans need not define their identity by any imported heritage, including Islam.</p>
<p>By his impulsive utterances and actions, Gaddafi has shown quite clearly that he has no respect for black people and he sees sub-Saharan Africa as lost people only to be converted to Islam. I call on the African Union (AU), the European Union (EU), the Italian government, the United Nations (UN), the Arab world and Sub-Saharan African people to condemn in no uncertain terms the racial and thoughtless remarks of the Libyan leader.</p>

		<p>Gaddafi is right about Europe being overrun by black Africans. It is also being overrun with the followers of Islam. Soon, the white Europeans will find themselves dispossessed in their own lands, with nowhere to go. They will have only themselves and the foolish notion of diversity to blame.</p>

I wish he&rsquo;d said EXACTLY that - it&rsquo;s correct in both fact and tone.  We do need to protect our <i>prestigious white identity</i> and prevent it from being blackened/browned/etc.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Proud&#8221; blacks and browns in America and Europe should be <i>proud</i> to buy a one-way ticket to their ancestral homelands; surely they&rsquo;ll be <i>proud</i> to work hard contributing to the growth of <b>their own</b> societies.  Otherwise, how can they be &#8220;proud&#8221; of their culture while risking life and limb to get away from it?  </p>

		<p>If whites were running Africa, these same blacks would be whining and complaining.  Blacks are such hypocrites when it comes to race.  Blacks don&rsquo;t want equality.  They demand supremacy.  Make no mistake about it.</p>

		<p>It is often difficult to really know what the Gaddafi really means but he certainly is able to get away with saying it.(What others only dare to think) Perhaps it will be a wake-up call for Europe and the rest of the West re being overrun with Islamic and African  immigrants.</p>
<p>Only 40 years ago the reason given for Australia&rsquo;s involvement in the Viet-Nam war was that Australia was in imminent danger of being overrun and invaded by the Asian hordes (the Yellow Peril) to our immediate north and to make matters worse they were communist! The public accepted this then. How things have changed.</p>
<p>But reading between the lines of Gaddafi&rsquo;s message is the underlying message of what is happening to Planet Earth, gross overpopulation and there is just not enough room for all of us. And where is the population exploding most, poor African &amp; most Islamic nations.</p>

		<p>It sounds like the author of this piece has a pretty good handle on what Gaddafi is up to. I would only add a second part in which Europeans are similarly warned about the dangers of Arab expansionism.</p>
<p>To paraphrase the 2nd to last paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Gaddafi must be told in the face that, [white Europe] has had enough from Arab and [African] expansionisms, which resulted in [welfare dependence, crime] and the lost of the [European] identity and personality. That, [white Europe] is not simply a cultural vacuum to be filled by the religious doctrines of any over-zealous groups of people seeking wealth, dominance, and influence. That, [white Europe] fought and freed itself from shackles of [tyranny] long time ago and finally that, [Europeans] need not define their identity by any imported heritage, including Islam.</i></p>

		<p>Apparently Gaddafi visualizes an Islamic European Empire of the future where only light skinned Muslims live.  Unfortunately, Gaddafi doesn&rsquo;t realize that his own &#8220;heritage&#8221; is just as meager as the ones he thinks to disparage so eagerly.</p>

<p>No one needs to put black Africa in a bad light. They do a fantastic job of that themselves. See the innate liberal bias here: the thinly veiled assumption that if it weren&rsquo;t for the efforts of anti-black propogandists, we&rsquo;d all wake up and see black Africa for the marvel of progress and modernity that it truly is. Sorry, guy, but Africa sucks, and it&rsquo;s not because anyone is unfairly protraying them. </p>

		<p>I am stunned! I thought Qadaffy was a close friend, ally, collaborator, and contributor to &#8220;Minister&#8221; Louis Farrakan (of mother ship and Yacoob fame). What went wrong? Perhaps this close association allowed Qaddafy to observe racial differences, and he became a realist  &mdash;  Or, he always held the typical Arab disdain and contempt for blacks but concealed them for socio-political and monetary gain whilst entertaining Screwy Looey.<br>

<p>Well, Europeans do need to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Yes.  So what?  I have no quarrel with that statement.</p>
<p>If Africans don&rsquo;t like our &#8220;prestigious White identity,&#8221; all they have to do is create a countervailing prestigious <i>black</i> identity. </p>

<p>Not true.  Blacks have NEVER lost their &#8220;African identity and personality&#8221; anywhere in the world they are.  Everywhere they are, is a &#8220;little Africa&#8221;.  Corruption, violence, inter-tribal wars, rape, incest, superstition, crumbling infrastructure, complete inability to control savage impulses or to adopt Western European work ethic, values and morality.<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is Italy, Sweden, England, Japan, China, the Caribbean, Latin America, or Detroit.  Even the most advanced and well ordered European or American societies cannot tame the savage black or induce him to be anything other than an African in mentality, morality, legality, or conduct.  They are WORSE than muslims.  Muslims at least have some sort of adherence to a moral and legal code.  Blacks have NO restraints or constraints.  Black muslim converts are not in Islam for the constraints it imposes upon them, they are in it for the inherent hatred of European White culture.  Period.  Gadaffi is just telling us what we already know.<br>

		<p>The writer&rsquo;s grasp of English grammar leaves something to be desired (though he does seem to know some big words), but his message is fairly clear.  He doesn&rsquo;t like what Gaddafi is saying about Black Africans.  While I never could be certain of Gaddafi&rsquo;s motives, I&rsquo;d say that what he is saying about Blacks is quite true.  If Sub-Sahara Africa is the paradise that Blacks claim, I have often wondered why they don&rsquo;t return to that center of all the great inventions and learning of the world in droves.  They would be away from the oppression of the White Man and the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; (so they think) and would be on their own to do as they will. It&rsquo;s also obvious that Black migration from Africa to the European countries is dragging them down in more ways than one, dumbing them down as just recently pointed out by a German in articles covered on AmRen.   </p>
<p>&#8220;Gaddafi&#8221;, &#8220;Khadafy&#8221;, &#8220;Kadafi&#8221;, or just plain &#8220;Daffy&#8221; - this fellow is making some sense here. He&rsquo;s being totally un-PC!!!! I still wouldn&rsquo;t trust him as far as I could throw him, though.</p>
