<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By suggesting that Muslims&rsquo; inability, or unwillingness, to speak German may be linked to their DNA, [Thilo] Sarrazin broke a post-Nazi taboo on foraying into genetic theories. {snip}</p>
<p>The massive success of Sarrazin&rsquo;s book [Germany Abolishes Itself] has cracked open growing anti-immigrant anger among many Germans, who fear that their language, culture and generosity is being abused by newcomers, especially Muslims, who they say live off their welfare state without contributing to it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But supporters say Sarrazin&rsquo;s criticisms are simply meant to make a point about what is expected of newcomers to Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not far-right extremists, we just want the people who come here to contribute something, to be polite and learn the language. Nothing more,&#8221; said Mike Temme, a doctor.</p>
<p>Temme was among a lively crowd of several hundred in Berlin who paid to hear Sarrazin debate his book, &#8220;Germany Abolishes Itself.&#8221; Support for the ex-banker was palpable as the crowd applauded his defense of his theories and drowned out any participants who questioned Sarrazin&rsquo;s use of genetic theory or accused him of manipulating data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;truth,&#8221; according to Sarrazin, is that Germans &#8220;have accepted as inevitable that Germany will be smaller and dumber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The three immigrant groups with the largest educational deficit and the highest social welfare costs, are also those with the highest rate of reproduction,&#8221; Sarrazin writes, citing Turks, immigrants from the former Yugoslavia and from the Middle East.</p>
<p>But plenty of Germans fear that Sarrazin, with his history of provocative statements and the stature of high office at the Deutsche Bundesbank, is fanning fires that will be hard to put out. Even before the book hit stores two weeks ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned its tone, saying the &#8220;ostracism and the contempt are unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a survey by ZDF public television, 56 percent of Germans say Sarrazin&rsquo;s criticism is justified, and many immigrants are feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am worried about my Germany,&#8221; said Samadi Ahadi, 38, a filmmaker who immigrated from Iran as a child and obtained German citizenship. He said the increase in discrimination since the book&rsquo;s release is felt on the streets and public transport, without elaborating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hardening attitudes toward Muslims are felt in many European countries. But these are generally spearheaded by the far-right, whereas Sarrazin, 65, belongs to the traditional, center-left Social Democratic Party, which is moving to expel him. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They are sick of being cursed or laughed at when they offer assistance with integration. And they are tired about reading about Islamist associations that have one degree of separation from terrorism, of honor killings, of death threats against cartoonists and filmmakers,&#8221; Matussek []Matthias Matussek] wrote in his blog for Der Spiegel&rsquo;s online edition.</p>
<p>The heated debate has left leaders struggling for a response.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Government research found that 37 percent of the 15- to 19-year-olds of immigrant background lack a high school diploma, required for nearly any form of employment here, and that 72 percent of Turkish-descended men aged of 20 to 64 lack basic job training.<br>

		<p>I am so tired of having anyone who breaks even slightly from the leftist dogma on race/immigration/ethno-social issues, etc., written off or condemned as a &#8220;far-right&#8221; kook! Most people I know personally believe and agree with much of what we Amren-ers do, if not fully consciously and more subtly - but still much more with us than against us, if you will. Yet very few of these people are &#8220;far-right&#8221; in their broader political attitudes. Many are conservative, many more libertarian, some rather liberal in various ways, but few are necessarily &#8220;right&#8221; by any traditional definition. </p>
<p>Then again, by most definitions/descriptions of the political right and left today almost anything/anyone can be lumped into either side, so I suppose it&rsquo;s all essentially meaningless either way!<br>

		<p>It is ironic that the memory of the Nazis has discouraged an inquiry into the relationship between genes and intelligence, because Ashkenazic Jews are the most gifted racial group in the world, with an average IQ of about 112.  <br>
 <br>
If the Nazis were burning books today, Germany Abolishes Itself, and The Bell Curve would be thrown into the flames.    </p>

		<p> Thilo Sarrazin has become the Enoch Powell of his time and nation. As did Powell, he is warning his country about a disastrous situation that must be addressed if that country is to survive as the Germany of most of the post-war era. And like Powell, he is being attacked as a &#8220;xenophobe,&#8221; &#8220;hater,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p> The German Left, like its British and American equivalents, resorts to bad-mouthing that suggests its opponents want to bring back Hitler and the Nazis, whenever the Left has no logical or sensible arguments left. &#8220;Racist&#8221; and &#8220;Islamophobe&#8221; are their default hate cries. And because of what Hitler and the Nazis did, 65 long years ago, those cries cause too many Westerners to flinch and hesitate, when they should be moving ahead and doing what needs to be done. And let the chips fall where they may. </p>

<p>The doctor can deny it all he wants. But the critics aren&rsquo;t concerned with whether he is a &#8220;far-right extremist&#8221; or not. They just say it to further their own power and political agenda. In earlier days his critics would be screaming &#8220;Witch!&#8221; and &#8220;Heretic!&#8221;</p>

<p>My wife is from the former Yugoslavia so I&rsquo;m not thrilled to hear that. Regardless, I still think Germany should make the welfare of the German people their first priority. And if that means cracking down immigration <i>including from the former Yugoslavia</i> then I&rsquo;ll back them up. It is their country after all.</p>

A high rate of immigration interferes with everything else liberals want to achieve in the United States.  It contributes to the growing income gap.  It is harmful to the environment.  A heterogeneous workforce is more difficult to organize into labor unions than a homogeneous workforce. Most white blue collar workers oppose high immigration.  It is one of the factors that causes them to vote Republican.   </p>

		<p>I applaud Sarrazin&rsquo;s book, but it could have the wrong effect. Defenders of the West do NOT want Germany&rsquo;s Muslim and other non-European immigrants &#8220;better integrated&#8221; into German society. We want them DEPORTED back to their real homelands. In the meantime, it is much better that they NOT be integrated; the more linguistically segregated they remain, the easier eventual repatriations will be. </p>
<p>I wonder, though: Is amren  becoming a kind of Ward Connerly/ Shelby Steele/ conservative-integrationist publication?  Many of its reader comments are not of the Far Right persuasion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that by &#8220;Yugoslavians&#8221;  Sarazin was referring to Albanians/Bosnians;  i.e. Moslems. </p>

I&rsquo;m pretty sure there is no reason for you to take offense, as the so-called &#8220;former Yugoslavians&#8221; being complained about are the brown MUSLIM ones, not the white Christian ones. And if you&rsquo;re an AmRen reader, I&rsquo;m assuming you wouldn&rsquo;t marry a Muslim, so this problem population of &#8220;Yugoslavians&#8221; are NOT of the same ethnicity as your wife. </p>
<p>That said, the rest of your point is quite correct: Germans and Germans alone should decide who gets into Germany   &mdash;   and although white Christian Yugoslavians are a MUCH better immigrant group than ANY brand of Muslim, if Germany (or any other historically white nation) decides they want ZERO immigration from ANYWHERE   &mdash;   either temporarily or permanently   &mdash;   it should be their right to enforce that decision. </p>

<p>  Even without Sarrazin&rsquo;s genetic theories, a strong case could be made for curtailing Muslim immigration. Why should Germany change centuries of custom and tradition to accommodate impoverished alien new comers? Germany, unlike the United States, is not a country of immigration. Muslims appear to have difficulty integrating into all Western countries. For many Islamic fundamentalists, allegiance to religion supersedes allegiance to liberal democracy or even basic individual rights. Finally, as the late Milton Friedman said, a welfare state cannot survive with open borders &mdash; Germany has clearly reached that stage.  Germany can&rsquo;t afford to bail out Southern Europe, let alone immigrants from Africa and the Muslim world. </p>

		<p>As a banker, Sarrazin has the credibility to point the finger at the root causes of Germany&rsquo;s (and the West&rsquo;s) decline - it is our rulers who have sold us out, surrendering our sovereign possessions to the unelected global financisl elites.</p>
<p>Mass immigration inflates consumption and debt, while dividing and weakening the democratic ability of nations to defend themselves from the market manipulations of globalists.</p>

<p>Good point. Those putting the Koran before the Constitution should be barred.  Therefore, before admitting Moslems to western, democratic countries (if we must at all), this point should be made very clear to them at the outset; and those refusing to agree to it, sign a paper, or take an oath, should be denied admittance.  </p>
<p>Some humaniarians may howl that we are interferring with someone&rsquo;s &#8220;human rights&#8221; or religious rights. But this is a self-preservation measure that we must take for our own wellbeing. It&rsquo;s either them or us, and there&rsquo;s no reason why we should treat their interests as equal to our own.</p>

<p>Book burning is old fashioned.  Why burn the book when you can burn the brain?  If you can train humans through situation controlled TV and movies, talk shows, etc, which is then reinforced in the work place and church, they self censor and you don&rsquo;t have to chase every book that comes along.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of voices in defence of Muslim and non-White Third World invasion/colonisation are those of the Far Left persuasion, ie, Trotskyites, Marxists and Stalinists.</p>
<p>Those of the Nationalist right must start tarring the Far Left with its own brush.  </p>
<p>At rallies and on internet forums, Far Leftists must be referred to at all times, as anti-White race haters, Communists, Bolsheviks, Trotskyites, Marxists, Stalinists, Taliban backers and Pol Potters.  </p>
<p>Banners recommending that the public educate themselves about the history behind the bearers of these labels, ought to be flown too.  Every one of these labels must be hurled at them by patriot demonstrators at<b>every</b> event where the Far Left enemy amasses.</p>
<p>The current System which embodies all of the above, has not yet been subjected to a sufficiently strong enough and prolonged onslaught of denigration and vilification in the public arena so that the psychic of the masses is turned against it wholsale, equating it correctly so with mass alien invasion and colonisation, territorial robbery, mass murder, mass rape and the stealth mass genocide by proxy of indigenous White Europeans.</p>
