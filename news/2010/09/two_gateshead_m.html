<h1>Two Gateshead Men Arrested for Watching 9/11 Koran Burning Video</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Civil Liberty (UK), September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a disturbing development, Northumbria Police in Gateshead last week arrested two men after they watched and shared a video on Facebook of a man burning the Koran in the US during the recent 9/11 commemoration at Ground Zero in New York.</p>
<p>The men were drinking in the Bugle pub, Leam Lane, Gateshead, when they were arrested after watching and sharing the videos.</p>
<p>Around 30 people staged a protest outside Gateshead police station on Wednesday evening, the 15th of September, following the arrests.</p>
<p>The group stood outside the doors to the police station with an England flag for about three hours watched by a contingent of uniformed officers. The protesters had gathered at around 8pm after the two men were arrested earlier in the day on &#8216;suspicion of inciting racial hatred&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The protest continued until around 11pm when the two arrested men were bailed pending further enquiries.</p>
<p>In a further development, the man who actually burned the Koran in the video on 9/11 in New York has been sacked from his job.</p>
<p>Derek Fenton, 39, of Bloomingdale, New Jersey, had worked for NJ Transit for 11 years as a conductor and train co-ordinator. One of his neighbours, Jacqui Marquez, said: &#8220;Good for him for burning the Koran. Everybody&rsquo;s entitled to their opinion. By firing him, they&rsquo;re sending a message that there&rsquo;s no freedom of speech. They&rsquo;re completely wrong for doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Youtube have now removed all footage of Derek Fenton burning the Koran. Of course, if he had burnt the Stars and Stripes (or any other flag or religious book) the video would still be available. Double standards by Youtube, perhaps?</p>
<p>However, Civil Liberty has tracked down a blog which has embedded the video of Fenton&rsquo;s Koran-burning exploits and providing you are prepared to risk arrest from the British police, you can watch it <a href="https://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=76&amp;sid=366764" target="burning" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a><br>

<p>As an aside, I&rsquo;ve pretty much given up being sorrowful about 9/11 and worried about Muslim terrorism.  What can I do to solve it if our big brave multi-trillion dollar endowed government takes the side of the Muslims on practically everything, and lets many hundreds of thousands of Muslims immigrate even after 9/11?  What can I do to solve it if the mayor of the city most impacted by 9/11 has no problem with what is for all intents and purposes an enemy installation within what used to be the shadows of the two buildings the enemy knocked down?  What can I do about it if whacked out kook illiberals who are supposed to be so secular have pretty much declared Islam their official religion, for all intents and purposes?  What can I do about it if our eleven-figure-a-year Pentagon and its lawyers fight on the side of the enemy against our own soldiers every time one of our own soldiers does their job a little too well?  </p>

		<p>Why is it inciting &#8220;racial&#8221; hatred, if a religious book is burned that is used by people of all races?</p>
<p>Or are the decision-makers being &#8220;racist&#8221; for presuming that Koran = non-white?</p>

		<p>Some person burned a koran and put it in a garbage can of a mosque somewhere in the US.It is being investigated as a hate crime!Was I asleep when the First Amendment was repealed?A Turk in Saudi Arabia was executed for taking a koran into the bathroom to read!</p>

		<p>By the smirk on Mister Fenton&rsquo;s face, I would say he did the burning to gain personal notoriety, not as an act against those jihadists who brought down the towers, however, he had the First Amendment right to do so (so I thought). In the case of the Englishmen watching a video of the burning, in public at a Pub, I cannot see how a law was broken here by simply viewing. But is it against the law to view child pornography, or just down load it?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The group stood outside the doors of the police station with a contingent of police watching.&#8221;  Reading that reminded me of a scene from the Gilbert Roland late night movie &#8220;Our Lady of Fatima&#8221;. It`s the one where the villagers demand the return of their children and the reopening of the church. If people start flinging dirt on the &#8220;proclamation&#8221; nailed to the front door, well things could get interesting&hellip;</p>

		<p>If anything happens to Derek Fenton, do not be surprised if pages of the Quran become available written on pig skin shortly thereafter.  Yes, they will be nicely framed and written in nice Arabic calligraphy.</p>

		<p> We need to appropriate the &#8220;suspicion of inciting racial hatred&#8221; phrase anytime a black or brown complains about our White Humanity&rsquo;s quest for Life, Liberty, Property, and the Pursuit of White Happiness.</p>
<p>Diversity, Inclusion, and Tolerance should be arrested for suspicion of inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>White Eve Carson&rsquo;s murderers weren&rsquo;t charged with a Hate Crime.  Why not? Because they are protected by the Diversity Privilege. How do you know her murder was indeed a Hate Crime? Because her black murderers KNEW that she was White.  Case closed.</p>
<p>The prosecutor&rsquo;s dereliction should have been enough to get him arrested for &#8220;suspicion of inciting racial hatred,&#8221; i.e. permitting hate crimes against White Humanity to go unpunished.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Inciting racial hatred&#8221;  &mdash;  what an idiotic phrase! Can something as extreme as hatred ever be &#8220;incited?&#8221; </p>
<p>This phrase came about during the modern-day politically correct era. It&rsquo;s a distortion of the original definition of &#8220;inciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at an old 1938 edition of the <i>Funk &amp; Wagnalls Desk Standard Dictionary</i> I keep around for reference purposes, I see that the word &#8220;incite&#8221; is defined as &#8220;to impel toward a certain <i>action,&#8221;</i> not emotion. The idea that emotions can be incited is a deliberate distortion of the original word,</p>
<p>As proof of how idiotic this phrase is, think of the reverse: &#8220;inciting love&#8221; (racial or otherwise). Is anybody ever accused of doing this? Of course not, because extreme emotions like love (or hatred) cannot be &#8220;incited.&#8221; </p>
<p>If they could, then, if enough people could go around &#8220;inciting love,&#8221; we would all be holding hands and singing Kumbaya with each other! </p>
<p>This is of course aside from the fact that, even if hatred could be &#8220;incited&#8221; there could and should be nothing illegal about it. Last I checked, emotions, whether they be love or hate, were not illegal, as long as they are not illegally acted upon. </p>
<p>The concept of &#8220;Inciting racial hatred&#8221; is a farce, and an obscene one at that.</p>

		<p>What an outrage against human rights that these men were arrested for merely watching a video of an act of free expression.</p>
<p>How the Brits can stand their absurd anti-free speech government and sell-out politicians is beyond me. Only a right wing party election can begin to save the Brits from the consequences of so many years of sell-out stupidity &amp; cowardice, but they don&rsquo;t have the spine to elect them. Their national culture will be destroyed beyond recognition in a few generations.</p>

		<p>Maybe WE don&rsquo;t have the spine to stop them either. It wasn&rsquo;t very long ago this kind of thing wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Step by step incursions by muslims, mexicans, illegals, blacks, etc. will have us cowering in a corner because decent White Americans have been brainwashed and now have the laws against them. I hate to sound so negative but I believe we are doomed. And there will be a nasty end to this sick and twisted mindset. Once the baloon goes up, we will indeed defend ourselves. </p>

		<p>It sure is interesting how Muslims are now a race.</p>
<p>In the Orwellian dystopia formerly known as Great Britain, cops are actually paid to hang out in pubs and restaurants in order to catch people saying politically incorrect things, so they can be arrested.  Thanks to multiculturalism, Big Brother is watching you.</p>
<p>Note the evil eye peering through the peephole at the top of the SPLC&rsquo;s Hatewatch blog: <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/blog/" rel="nofollow">https://www.splcenter.org/blog/</a><br>
This certainly symbolizes the left&rsquo;s dream of a total police state to prevent dissenting thought.<br>

		<p>This is patently insane.  It&rsquo;s a book  &mdash;  an evil book, to be sure, but just a book.  I&rsquo;d like to see what would happen to a couple of brits if they were caught watching these videos:</p>
