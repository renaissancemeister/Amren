			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>US Report (Jacksonville, Florida), September 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} What pop media has provided little information about is the real testimony given by Dr. Carol M. Swain, professor of political science and law at Vanderbilt University. Did Democrat representative Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) invite Colbert to distract from Dr. Swain&rsquo;s reasoned, fact-based testimony?</p>
<p>Begin with the professor&rsquo;s blunt statement  &mdash;  her testimony on immigration is posted on the House Judiciary website: &#8220;America does not have a shortage of agricultural workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swain goes on to explain, &#8220;If there were truly labor shortages, one would expect rising wages and more attractive working conditions than what one finds. One would not expect to find unemployment rates of 10.8 percent in May and 7.9 percent in August.&#8221; She said those figures suggest &#8220;there are native workers actively seeking employment in the sector that includes agricultural workers, forestry, fishing and hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ag workers usually have less than a high school education. Swain said there is a high turnover rate in this sector  &mdash;  they leave fields and farms, she said, for other low-wage, low-skill occupations.</p>
<p>That creates competition with low-skilled Americans, she said, for a dwindling supply of low-wage jobs.</p>
<p>Swain also pointed out that low-skilled native born workers with minimal education have an unemployment rate of 20.8 percent, but if you use the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; U-6 measure of unemployment, you end up with an actual unemployment rate of 32.4 percent.</p>
<p>Thus, native born blacks and Hispanics with a high school education or less suffer from current policy  &mdash;  among native born blacks in this sector the unemployment rate is 29 percent but the U-6 measure is 43 percent.</p>
<p>Put flatly, Swain said, &#8220;The influx of low-skilled guest workers hurt native born blacks, Hispanics and poor whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a solution, Swain believes the federal E-Verify program should be aggressively encouraged. And she cited steps by President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration that have eroded immigration laws. Swain said, &#8220;Unfortunately, the Obama Administration has done little to help native workers. The Administration has essentially ended workplace enforcement and they have cancelled the rule that would have required employers to act on the &#8216;no-match&rsquo; letters from the Social Security Administration. These letters would have helped employers identify fraudulent social security numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Swain made more sense than all the congressmen and other witnesses when she stated, &#8220;We do not need additional guest workers until the unemployment rate of native workers approaches zero percent. What we do need is for Democrats and Republicans to join forces in pressing for the enforcement of existing immigration laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the fact Dr. Swain is a distinguished, widely published scholar, pop media overlooked Swain&rsquo;s testimony, focusing instead on silly antics from a celebrity comic. {snip}</p>

		<p>A caller to Rush&rsquo;s show on Friday said that the technology already exists to mechanize completely the planting and harvesting of virtually all crops planted in America.  He also said that Europe doesn&rsquo;t use migrant labor for farm plantings and harvesting, because Europe has been mechanized for some time.  The caller had a theory, which Rush didn&rsquo;t doubt, that there are subtle Federal tax policies to discourage farms from mechanization, all as a quiet mechanism to use &#8220;migrant labor,&#8221; so that there can be more Hispanics in the country for the Democrats to have more votes, and for other interests, e.g. construction, to have a ready source of cheap labor.</p>
<p>And yes, I do think the Colbert clown testimony was a diversion, both from Swain&rsquo;s testimony in front of the same committee, but also the Coates testimony about the NBPP/DOJ shenanigans in front of another committee.</p>

		<p>What is so sad, and in fact evil, about the Leftist&rsquo;s constant demand for open borders and massive inflow of uneducated, unskilled labor is that it actually harms the very constituency that the Left claims to protect.  The massive importation of Third Worlders leads to lower salaries and unemployment for less-educated Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites.  </p>
<p>Without massive immigration, salaries for low-end jobs would rise dramatically, and American citizens now out of work could find employment, and the security, honor, and pride that comes with doing an honest day&rsquo;s work.  Welfare costs would plummet, as would drug- and petty crime, lowering taxes, invigorating the economy, lifting all, including the Left&rsquo;s precious minorities and poor!  </p>
<p>But, the Left cannot see beyond their nose.  They cannot reason or use logic.  As a result, we find very high unemployment and misery among the lower classes, who cannot obtain a livable salary. </p>

		<p>What we do need is for Democrats and Republicans to join forces in pressing for the enforcement of existing immigration laws.</p>
<p>This is an extremely important statement that needs to be tracked over the next several months.  The myth is that mexican theft of resources and jobs is a bipartisan issue and that it doesn&rsquo;t matter who is elected.</p>
<p>In 6 weeks, this myth will be put to the test&hellip;..as sweeping republican wins dramatically change the balance of power in the US.  I expect the republicans will soon control both the House and the Senate, with the nation moving very far to the right.</p>
<p>What exactly will it mean to white nationalism if, after this change takes place, dramatic improvements are made with regard to the mexican problem?  If millions of mexicans and other undesirables are forced out of our country by a republican controlled Congress, that will mean that the GOP is the party of white racial self-interest that demands our support.</p>
<p>Certainly, they have given strong lip service to this over the last several months.  It is now time for them to put their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>And if they do, it will be time for US to admit there is a big difference between the two parties with regard to race.  The GOP being the white person&rsquo;s party and the democrats being the criminal non-white&rsquo;s party.</p>

Here&rsquo;s a piece on immigration from c-spans Washington Journal:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/24brns2</p>
<p>You can slid the player to 1:41 (after the political cartoons) to see the half hour discussion with Peggy Orchowski, Author, &ldquo;Immigration &amp; the American Dream&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She makes some good points about the changes in immigration such as moving it from the labor department to the justice department. She also explains how Ted Kennedy help turn immigration into a civil rights issue (which she says it isn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s worth watching and her book worth reading.<br/>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the two segments of Dr. Swain&rsquo;s speech that probably have the most contextual use:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Without this surplus labor, employers would be forced<br/>
to pay higher wages and many would be forced to improve substandard working conditions.<br/>
Instead of paying $8.00 or $9.00 dollars per hour, employers would be forced to pay $12.00 or<br/>
$13.00. Phil Martin shows that an increase in the wages of farm workers would not substantially<br/>
increase the average family&rsquo;s grocery bill.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I have a feeling the U.S. is functioning on a debt relief system of garnished wages and limited spending such that trying to drag up the LMI classes with risky inflationary spending isn&rsquo;t seen as being wise.  Yes, I know we are throwing away &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; funds by the truckful at ethnic social welfare but that&rsquo;s reabsorbed by the stumbling economy in months (why they push cash at the worthless instead of sponsoring innovation from the smart, lots of cash in the system allows it to coast&hellip;).</p>
<p>Let me also state that I think that most U6 labeled people (out of work for more than a year and no longer looking or working at 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether you could WPA kickstart them into a work ethnic or not but I doubt if they are going to be moving up for even a substantial increase in minimum wage.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Our nation is in trouble. Ultimately, our success or failure will depend on how much we<br/>
value and fight to preserve the Rule of Law, the sovereignty of our nation, and the hope that our<br/>
nation continues to offer to its own citizens as well as the millions of people around the world<br/>
who would like to live here.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>A nation is not a state, it&rsquo;s a group.  A collection of ethnically homogenous peoples whose societal rules include such things as elderly care and specific, &#8216;national&rsquo;, objectives such as the advancement of race.</p>
<p>Hispanics have no such overt (political) interests here and while I imagine they would if we invaded Mexico, their general attitude of &#8216;head down, work hard and -wait for it-&rsquo; seems to be a viable strategy for them.  Particularly when you look at this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br/>
In an age of diminished resources, the United States may be heading for an intensifying confrontation between the gray and the brown.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest demographic trends reshaping the nation in the 21st century increasingly appear to be on a collision course that could rattle American politics for decades. From one direction, racial diversity in the United States is growing, particularly among the young. Minorities now make up more than two-fifths of all children under 18, and they will represent a majority of all American children by as soon as 2023, demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution predicts.</p>
<p>At the same time, the country is also aging, as the massive Baby Boom Generation moves into retirement. But in contrast to the young, fully four-fifths of this rapidly expanding senior population is white. That proportion will decline only slowly over the coming decades, Frey says, with whites still representing nearly two-thirds of seniors by 2040.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Similar questions loom over the federal budget debates. Largely because of Medicare and Social Security, Washington now spends $7 per senior citizen for each $1 it spends per child, according to a 2009 report by Julia Isaacs, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. <br/>
&gt;</p>
<p>http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20100724_3946.php</p>
<p>I swear, it looks to me like the Elites have decided that their &#8216;nation&rsquo; of fellow whites in the Middle Class are locking down too much capital, both directly and by coming entitlements.</p>
<p>Which means that, by importing (&#8216;electing&rsquo;) a new supermajority of mixed ethnies who WON&rsquo;T pay for another group&rsquo;s old age, they can collapse the overly skilled, overly paid, and massively supported existing population&rsquo;s economic vestiture and reboot it into the last of half of the century as a new growth phase.</p>
<p>Of course they ignore 50% black and 70% hispanic high school drop out rates and 60% black and 50% hispanic extra marital birth rates.</p>
<p>DREAM will supposely attract smarter immigrants.  And CRA&rsquo;s followons will house their huge families.</p>
<p>While if your interest is in literally maintaining the bottom line which has people living together like ants to afford the &#8216;American Dream&rsquo; at 8 dollars an hour, all of which is rapidly converted into junk/subsistence consumerism, it may make sense.  Particularly for Hispanics with their massive TFRs (2.8-3.2, 4.4 after the last Amnesty).</p>
<p>(White) Americans, as a herd, don&rsquo;t die young enough, produce rapidly enough or expend their earnings vapidly enough to keep the cogs turning.  And this is an unacceptable flaw in macro economics which seeks volume over value.</p>
<p>Indeed, particularly if this is in fact about &#8216;globalization&rsquo; and not -allowing- any one nation&rsquo;s economic GDP:debt ratio to be so high as to remain independent from induced collectivism trends, worldwide, Americans have to go.  We are far too conservative to be trusted with our money.</p>
<p>If Doctor Swain looked at the issue from the same perspective, I have a feeling her arguments would change.  First and foremost because raising the value of the minimum wage WOULD cause at least a minor hiccup in inflationary norms.  And Second because she thinks American the Nation is still looking out for it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>And that is not our Elite&rsquo;s agenda at all.</p>
<p>Of course, when I say this, I look across the seas at France which has been dealing with a 23% unemployment rate among it&rsquo;s own unskilled youth since the early 90s.  And I look at China where factory management hires workers on a seasonal basis with no health care or employment guarantees and then sends them home with pennies to starve for another season on their parent&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>And I wonder why, if we are too expensive to employ as individuals, we don&rsquo;t subsidize ourselves via mass automation like the Japanese are successfully doing&hellip;  4:1 earner to burner makes a social welfare state workable if the worker doesn&rsquo;t have to be paid at all.</p></p>

		<p>I think it is ridiculous for anyone who is not serious to go and take up the time of government officials for the sake of being &ldquo;funny&rdquo;.<br/>
Comedy is an important part of being human, and it can make the worst of situations a little better, but there is a time and a place.  Our government officials should not be wasting their time with jokes but instead they should be using that time to fix our crumbling nation, that is, if they can.<br/>
Colbert, though I understand he is supposed to be satire, has shown very much so (out of character) his belief in the same religious dogma that &ldquo;Americans (specifically Euro-Americans) won&rsquo;t do the work illegals will&rdquo; and &ldquo;immigration laws are racist&rdquo;, so much for critical thinking. <br/>

		<p>Ironic that Barack Hussein and Holder are the Simon Legrees of today. Of course, since the vast majority of blacks don&rsquo;t read or read anything more challenging than a sex romance black novel, they wouldn&rsquo;t know who Simon Legree is, or what Uncle&rsquo;s Tom Cabin is.  I once asked a group of black 15 yrs olds when Martin King lived, and they said &#8220;around the civil war&#8221;. Then they couldn&rsquo;t agree on when that was.</p>

		<p>The biggest reason I think this is just a coincidence (rather than a distraction) is this.  Important news simply falls down the memory hole.  The brainwashing in the west has gotten so severe that even when evidence is plastered right in the face of most people, they simply note it, go that&rsquo;s interesting (but simply not relevant to me) and then go blithely on the next day as the media drops the issue.  Even if the media makes a point to cover an event with non-stop, 24 hour coverage for days and weeks, it&rsquo;s quickly forgotten as they move on to the next thing.  My point is, they don&rsquo;t need a distraction.  Simply cover the issue.  Those disposed will be outraged for a few days (and do nothing).  Everyone else will switch over to the latest episode of desperate housewives.</p>
<p>This is one of many techniques used for social control (and a pretty effective one at that).  Rather than not cover news, they simply create so MUCH news, in a nonstop stream, that the importance of individual items becomes diffused.  People aren&rsquo;t ignorant of what is going on so much as its been trivialized.  Most people go, oh yeah&hellip;.I heard about that.  Say, did you hear about Tiger Woods cheating on his wife&hellip;.blah, blah, blah.</p>

		<p>agriculture work is low wage for poorly educated people BECAUSE there are millions of non-whites willing to take those jobs + live on welfare.</p>
<p>If the millions of mexicans and blacks were not in our country, then agriculture would be a high wage job which people could live on.</p>

		<p>One of the things about Agro that will have to change soon is the enormous amount of fuel it takes to bring a given acre of crop X or growth of animal Y to a marketable state.</p>
<p>As things now stand, it takes roughly 1.8 acres of arable land, 2.2 acres of pasture land, 1,300 gallons of water and 2,500 gallons of fuel _per capita year_ to keep us fed.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/s85dy" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/s85dy</a></p>
<p>Throw in fertilizer, pesticides/herbicides and the like as well as transport costs to distribution points and inherent losses due to spoilage and the negative thermodynamic effects (energy in, work out) just become enormous on the simple basis of distribution lags and distances.</p>
<p>Automation of this process and particularly a new generation of machines that function off of more efficient solar-electric rather than fuel driven power plants could be a major way to past this.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>To afford the scale of application that makes these technologies pay off, you have to have such vast areas under plow that it may be something that is only applicable to commercial level use.</p>
<p>And big agro doesn&rsquo;t want to buy into the first generation (infrastructure setup) period of this when they can pay pennies on the dollar equivalent.</p>
<p>For migrant workers.</p>
<p>In fact, a great deal of the farming innovation of the last 20 or so years came, not from the big companies but from private sources and when, between 1997 and 2003, something like 25% of our working farm families just gave up, absolute control over how this nation secures it&rsquo;s food stuffs became purely a corporate matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, everything we know about pricing will change when the fixed controls on petroleum products come off and countries like China start buying based on true economic power rather than what they are quota&rsquo;d in the existing system.</p>
<p>Without total control over the distributionist capitalist baseline which oil for cash represents (the dollar is fiat secured by oil, not market economics or gold) what will end up happening is that U.S. gover-corp will become so outrageously _expensive_, as a provider of the most basic services, that we will be back to the days of walking out our back door to secure our daily calories on the lowest possible ground-to-plate level travel distance.  </p>
<p>In this, a good, sustainable agro, private farmer can till and plant and weed and harvest a couple acres of food for around 25 gallons of fuel a year, producing enough food for about 5 people overall.  Yields will obviously be less if you are doing a backyard style subsistence system but the fact remains that actual home owners will have an enormous edge in sustainment, if gasoline prices drive up food stuffs and they can just keep electricity and water coming (from coal, not fuel oil fired power plants, the Chinese ain&rsquo;t dumb&hellip;).</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2w9adbk" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2w9adbk</a></p>
<p>The key thing to remember is simply that we now have around 300 million people living in the U.S..  In 2050, that number will be 520 million.</p>
<p>And guess whose streaming hordes are both now and via future birthrates, going to create the biggest part of that population bloom-as-crisis?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, our wondrously &#8216;cheap&rsquo; manual laborers whom we import to do jobs nobody else supposedly will.</p>
<p>Youth before Wisdom is not always a good idea and this illustration provides yet another reason to be backing off ANY continued immigration as pop growth for the next century or so until fusion and fuel cells can takeover from weak &#8216;renewables&rsquo; to power the automation that finally makes our agro self sufficient on the energy-in (replacement for gasoline) side of the equation.</p>
<p>The Japanese, who are headed from 128 million souls to around 70 in the next 50 years, have the actual direction we should be going right.  If we could control all the other population group&rsquo;s birth rates, the rise of automation would dovetail nicely with our own, sub-replacement level, TFRs.</p>

		<p>Im from Florida. In the early 90s when the Mexican tidal wave hit many white worked in the orange grove maintanence industry. Seasonal mexicans had always picked the fruit and moved on as migrants should. In the early 90s working ina grove paid around 9 dollars an hour at 5 ten hour days so you got 10 hours of overtime pay every week. These jobs were done by young people just out of high school just starting out and older people who didnt have any really marketable skills. When the mexicans flooded in the whites were layed off and mexicans hired for 4 dollars an hour. All that happened was the grove owners went from making good money to becoming obcenely rich overnight. Produce prices didnt drop the rich just got richer and a segment of white workers were out of a job.<br/>
So saying whites wont do the jobs is an out and out lie. I know this from personal observation.</p>
