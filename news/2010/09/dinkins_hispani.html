<h1>Dinkins: Hispanic Candidate &#8216;Looks More Like Us&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Candice M. Giove, New York Post, September 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mayor David Dinkins encouraged voters to embrace a state Senate candidate because he looks &#8220;more like us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important, it is so very important, particularly for the people of this district who vote on Tuesday to recognize how important it is to understand that the city is changing,&#8221; Dinkins said in his endorsement of state Senate candidate Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people in the city are going to look more like us than others and that&rsquo;s just a fact,&#8221; Dinkins said.</p>
<p>Espaillat opponent Mark Levine, who is white, yesterday called on Espaillat, who is Hispanic, to denounce the divisive comment.</p>
<p>Espaillat did not repudiate Dinkins&rsquo; words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayor Dinkins is one of New York&rsquo;s finest public servants, and he&rsquo;s built his career around the principle that communities of different ethnic and economic backgrounds must work together if we want to bring about long-term change,&#8221; Espaillat said in a statement.</p>

		<p>This Dinkins guy is the MAYOR of New York now? What happened to Bloomberg? Anyway, he sounds like a real idiot. Why is it that minorities can get away with saying openly rascist things, when us white people can&rsquo;t? I would give a million bucks if I were a prominent public figure and could get away with saying &#8220;Vote for LeVine, he looks like us!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Dinkins is one of New York&rsquo;s finest public servants?  Even given that the bar for public servants in New York is extremely low, identifying the risible Dinkins, a comically stupid lip-bibbling idiot, as one of New York&rsquo;s finest beggars belief.</p>

		<p>Dinkins always was slow. Would it shock him to know that Hispanics, a term beloved by beggars of federal aid and by the US Census, is a meaningless term. There are rich and poor Hispanics. There are brown, black, white and red mixed Hispanics. Some even speak Portugese, not Spanish. Some are Sephardic Jews, Dinkins you challenged child.</p>

		<p>The biggest black fantasy of all is that &#8220;hispanics&#8221; and Asians will help them overthrow white rule.  Almost every hispanic that I&rsquo;ve ever interacted with had a great disdain for American blacks and weren&rsquo;t shy in letting you know it.  Needless to say that Asians and blacks certainly didn&rsquo;t feel any special kinship.  Look no further than the attacks on Asians in Philadelphia schools for further proof.  </p>

		<p>Race is the number one topic of discussion in the black community.  If you have zero or limited interaction with black people you can look on black websites and see how pervasive race topics are with black people.  On youtube you will notice practically every black channel talks about race or is connected to it.  Black people know what David Dinkins said, not that they needed his encouragement because I am sure black people who will vote have talked explicitly to each other why they will vote for Adriano Espaillat a thousand times.</p>

The only thing surprising is that while blacks talk like this all the time most whites don&rsquo;t seem to here what they&rsquo;re saying and infer an obvious conclusion.</p>

		<p>Yeah voting based not on comptetence or idealogy but rather upon which  people who &#8220;look like you&#8221;, what lofty idealistic democratic ideals black leaders espouse.  </p>
<p>Dinkins is wrong though, most of our hispanics in NYC are mostly white puerto ricans. Black leaders are pretty audacious to claim them as their people.</p>

		<p>Having lived in NYC under Dinkins&rsquo; &#8220;public service&#8221; as mayor, his comments do not surprise me.  Dinkins serially ignored crime and criminals, and this resulted in the (eventual) election of Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  I am sure that Dinkins still regards Giuliani&rsquo;s successful efforts to reduce crime as somehow racist.  </p>
<p>Under Dinkins&rsquo; watch, my apartment was broken into, everything of value was stolen (including my long-deceased grandfather&rsquo;s fraternity pin), even my phone.  Why do I bother to mention my phone?  Because they called back two weeks later  &mdash;  they literally had my number  &mdash;  to threaten my life.  They were as African as David Dinkins, and just as belligerent and anti-white.</p>

		<p>As a kid I&rsquo;d take my fishing pole to Pier 9 in San Francisco and every time I was there I&rsquo;d see all these old Chinese men fishing.  I think for many of them it was their livelihood.  So I can&rsquo;t say I agree about Asians not fishing.  I&rsquo;d say Blacks not fishing is probably true, Blacks in general don&rsquo;t have much appreciation for nature.  If one of them throws a soda can in the trash bin instead of on the ground, it&rsquo;s the exception.  In the UK, &#8220;Asian&#8221; is just a catchall word for Indian or Middle Eastern, right?  So maybe that&rsquo;s what the writer is referring to, cause there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of Chinese fishermen.</p>

<p>I truly believe that many, many Whites are going to suffer terribly before they finally wake up.  The question is, when they do, are there going to be enough of us left to wage a battle?</p>

		<p>Everytime a non-white utters something like this, another white spine is stiffened against our ethnic demise.  Self-hating liberal elites may be nearly ubiquitous on TV, but the masses are another thing entirely.</p>

		<p>David Dinkins almost singlehandidly destroyed NYC.  A clubhouse politician and beneficiary of affirmative action, his administration saw a peak in crime, inefficency, and cronyism unmatched in the history of NYC.  In the next election, Rudy Guliani was elected and NYC saved.</p>

		<p>In other words, Dinkins would recommend blacks voting for a black or mestizo candidate solely on the basis of their ethnicity - and not on the basis of their policies.<br/>
You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you that policies are everything in politics, and it was White polticians such as the Kennedys and Lyndon Johnson who actually enabled blacks in the first place.Dinkins is really saying that he couldn&rsquo;t give a damn about those many, many White &#8216;liberal&rsquo; politicians (mostly Democrat)who did so much for him and his ilk.<br/>
 What ingratitude! - surely there must be a not so subtle message hidden there.<br/>

<p>  I&rsquo;m sure he does. Mayor Dinkin&rsquo;s likely considers the current  Mayor Bloomberg as an undiscovered racist. Perhaps, Mr. Dinkin&rsquo;s political career is not over yet. As a harbinger of bad times, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he ran again for Mayor of New York City or even New York governor post Paterson. </p>
<p>  &ldquo;Mayor Dinkins is one of New York&rsquo;s finest public servants, and he&rsquo;s built his career around the principle that communities of different ethnic and economic backgrounds must work together if we want to bring about long-term change,&rdquo; </p>
<p>  Sounds like a New York version of Barack Obama to me. Does New York City want this kind of &#8220;change&#8221; again?</p>

		<p>Claiming one should vote for someone who &#8216;looks more like us&rsquo; certainly is a good example of someone who &#8216;built his career around the principle that communities of different ethnic backgrounds must work together.&rsquo;  Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t have the job.</p>
