			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. cartoonist Molly Norris has been declared a &#8216;target&rsquo; by radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who has issued a fatwa calling for her death.</p>
<p>The social satirist, who stirred up a religious storm earlier this year with a tongue-in-cheek encouragement to draw images of the Muslim prophet Mohammed, has gone into hiding after threats to her safety.</p>
<p>Cleric al-Awlaki, 39, who is thought to be hiding in Yemen and has links to al Qaeda,  said in the June issue of &#8216;Inspire&rsquo;, an English-language magazine for American Muslim youth, that Norris was a &#8216;prime target&rsquo; whose &#8216;proper abode is hellfire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now the Seattle Weekly says Norris has been told by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to &#8216;go ghost&rsquo; following the news of the fatwa.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the insistence of top security specialists at the FBI,&rsquo; Norris is &#8216;moving, changing her name and essentially wiping away her identity,&rsquo; says the Seattle Weekly.</p>
<p>Norris, whose work regularly appears in the Seattle paper, gained international attention in the spring after she drew a mock promotion of an imaginary event, &#8216;Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The threat didn&rsquo;t become public until now because authorities thought it might be fake  &mdash;  until the full, 67-page issue of Inspire was recently posted on a jihadi message board.</p>
<p>The spoof picture drawn by Norris, which was published on Facebook, depicted various inanimate objects  &mdash;  including a coffee cup and a domino  &mdash;  each claiming to be the true likeness of the founder of Islam.</p>
<p>The cartoon was taken seriously by many, although Norris apologized to Muslims shortly after it was published in April. Norris she was just joking but the idea had already been widely circulated on internet sites and emailed around the world and soon more than 100,000 followers were on Facebook supporting the event.</p>
<p>&#8216;We understand the absolute seriousness of a threat from an Al Qaeda-inspired magazine and are attempting to do everything in our power to assist the individuals on that list to effectively protect themselves and change their behavior to make themselves less of a target,&rsquo; said David Gomez, the FBI&rsquo;s assistant special agent in charge of counter-terrorism in Seattle.</p>
<p>Norris originally launched her mock campaign in protest at threats of violence issued against those who depict Mohammed, which is considered blasphemous in Muslim culture.</p>
<p>The issue became a flashpoint five years ago when a caricature by Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard sparked sometimes violent protests. Westergaard has been under police protection since February 2008.</p>
<p>U.S. cartoon TV series South Park also stirred up controversy and threats earlier this year with its depiction of Mohammed in a bear suit. In Islam any drawings or depictions of Mohammad are strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>Norris is lying low for now and at the urging of the F.B.I. has moved and changed her name.<br>

		<p>&#8220;U.S. cartoonist Molly Norris has been declared a &lsquo;target&rsquo; by radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who has issued a fatwa calling for her death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The social satirist, who stirred up a religious storm earlier this year with a tongue-in-cheek encouragement&#8221;</p>
<p>This person will now have to go into hiding for the REST OF HER LIFE! And never practice her trade and craft again. I can well imagine that she just cannot believe this is happening.</p>
<p>This was done &#8220;tongue in cheek&#8221; but to the &#8220;brothers&#8221; [Muslims like to refer to themselves as &#8220;brothers&#8221;] this is dead serious stuff. DEAD in the literal sense of the word.</p>
<p>And pronouncements of this type by a Muslim &#8220;cleric&#8221; are NEVER rescinded and according to their &#8220;law&#8221; NEVER can be?</p>
<p>Contrast the Muslim attitude with that of the Christian. Hate the sin but love the sinner. Remember the crucifix in the bottle of urine upside down being touted as &#8220;a work of art&#8221;! Anyone remember the &#8220;artist&#8221; going into lifetime hiding? Of course not!</p>
<p>If you are Muslim and read this comment to the forumm, you need to stand up and STOP to your &#8220;brothers&#8221;. And do so in public.</p>

		<p>How many threats of death does this sick religion have to make in order for the world to know how dangerous and suicidally driven they are? Any people of a religion who takes themselves this seriously are deranged and evil. Is Israel the only country that gets this? Because they seem to be the only ones to speak out against them. The rest of the world leaders just welcome them to their shores with open arms.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it about time to stop their immigration, it seems, to all parts of this world? The politically correct left leave the citizens of America with no choice in this matter. Money talks and the safety and respect of its citizens walk. You got the money, brown people? Well, go right ahead and build your mosque at ground zero! The nerve.</p>
<p>It seems like these middle eastern fools are issuing death threats every other week-causing people to have to go underground to survive, beheading people on national TV, mutilating and/or stoning their women, the list is endless with these cowards. All while hiding behind their religion. Their about 2000 years behind - talk about a third world!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been one to endorse graffiti, but I think it&rsquo;s about time to give a shout out to all urban youth to hold an Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. I can see it now. Done in the night by dozens of kids -  five, ten twenty feet high. No names for Al Qaeda to issue a fatwa against. In every major city in America. Muslims outraged? Too bad. Then leave. Or spend your own money to paint over it.    </p>

		<p>An largely unaddressed issue of those &#8220;in hiding&#8221; for acts like these is the main reason they have to hide is local law enforcement refuses to protect them.</p>
<p>I wonder how many muslims would dare hassle them in a white town in texas, where they would be killed with impunity (in self defense), not just by their victim, but by their intended victim&rsquo;s neighbors.  And local law enforcement would be quick to pull them over, check their background, etc., simply because they were muslim&hellip;.and likely catch them long before they got within a hundred miles of their target.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hazard to say zero.  And the person wouldn&rsquo;t be &#8220;in hiding&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As she has learned, joking is not something that translates well culturally.  Muslim clerics are not known for their sense of humor, or of tolerance.</p>

		<p>I think the FBI wants Norris to hide because if a muslim actually killed her (and they would) it would be a massive blow to our muslim president and mOOslims in the U.S. There is no negotiations, appeasement or accomodation with/to/or for muslims, as far as they are concerned there is only total submission, conversion, enslavement of death.</p>

&lsquo;We understand the absolute seriousness of a threat from an Al Qaeda-inspired magazine and are attempting to do everything in our power to assist the individuals on that list to effectively protect themselves and change their behavior to make themselves less of a target,&rsquo; said David Gomez, the FBI&rsquo;s assistant special agent in charge of counter-terrorism in Seattle.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>&#8216;Change Their Behavior&rsquo;.  Whose side are they on again?</p>
<p>How about we issue a &#8216;fatwa&rsquo; of our own?  For every American killed, we will bomb 10,000 of you.  And for every 100 American&rsquo;s killed, we will bomb 100,000 of you.  Additively and Scalarly.</p>
<p>And then, let&rsquo;s also make it clear that if the local Islamic Community will not control their congregations, we will declare them an illegal religious group, like the Nazis and shut down every mosque in the U.S..</p>
<p>Keep in mind folks, the real reason these people don&rsquo;t want Mohammed humanized is because he was a sadistic butcher who:</p>
<p>1. Killed 600 POWs by beheading, personally, in a single day.  After ransacking their town in Arabia, in which they had lived, for centuries.</p>
<p>2. _Started a fire_ on a man&rsquo;s chest, simply because he didn&rsquo;t yet have enough gold and trinkets and thought it right and fitting to steal someone else&rsquo;.  At this time, Mohammed was probably the fourth richest man in the known world.  _And when the man yielded_ he had him killed anyway.  So that he could also have his wife.</p>
<p>3.  Mohammed was illiterate.  None of what he said or did was written down for about TWO CENTURIES after he died.</p>
<p>4.  Mohammed shows all the classic signs of a major neuro-psychological disorder, quite possibly epilepsy.</p>
<p>5.  Mohammed married a six year old girl and had sex with her at nine.  Even if she had begun puberty at that point, she was not physically developed enough to have children and so having sex with her, in primitive medical conditions, amounted to a death sentence for someone he supposedly &#8216;loved&rsquo;.</p>
<p>6.  Mohammed began a religion for much the same reason Tammy Fay Baker or any other religious evangelist did: he was so lousy at everything else that only by elaborate fraud and literal highway robbery was he able to do anything at all.  Indeed, Muslims to this day are -proud- of this man&rsquo;s heritage as a bandit.  Not a religious prophet.</p>
<p>I could add perhaps a hundred other damning proofs of this person&rsquo;s vile nature but I frankly don&rsquo;t care to do the research in the Muslim equivalent to the Anarchist&rsquo;s Cookbook: The Haditha.  There is little or nothing about this man that does not deserve derison.</p>
<p>And this from the perspective of someone who finds most religions to be confidence tricks and mass-manipulative control psychologies.</p>

		<p>What if everyone in the Free, non-Muslim World drew a cartoon of Mohamed?  Perhaps they ought to consider it done, because the West and even much of the East (Russia) will not cow-tow to demands of behavior from a religioun they don&rsquo;t practice.  This may be the actual essence of radical Islam&rsquo;s jihad against the West, we are irreverent by comparison and they can&rsquo;t stand their feeling of comparative bumpkin inferiority.</p>

		<p> What a sad, sad commentary on what the U.S. has become. An American citizen is threatened with death by a nutcase Muslim fanatic, and what does the FBI do? Advise her to, in effect, &#8220;crawl in a hole and pull it in after you!&#8221;</p>
<p> What are we paying the FBI for? To advise people, &#8220;You&rsquo;re in danger, and it&rsquo;s your lookout; sorry about your luck! Nothing we can do about it!&#8221;? Molly Norris has to give up her whole life, to keep from LOSING her life, instead of being placed under some kind of FBI protection? With such bodyguards, she could continue to practice her profession, which is assuring that freedom of the press stays alive in this country. Or have we surrendered completely to the &#8220;thug&rsquo;s veto&#8221;? </p>

<p>Are these the same people, out to kill this woman, who the MSNBC and CNN anchors openly stated they hoped they weren&rsquo;t involved with the bombing attempt in Times Square, adding they hoped the bomber was white, so as not to give non-whites a &#8220;bad name?&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a dedication to multiculturalism surely qualifies them as people who need their heads worked on by teams of shrinks.</p>
<p>But, then again, just a touch of reality here and there in close proximity to their news business and neighborhoods just might make even them understand cheering for murderers just might be dangerous.  </p>
<p>But, on second thought, I truly doubt it.  They had better go to the shrink or, better yet, a cult specialist experienced in deprogramming gullible fools who have lost touch with reality.</p>

		<p>This entire situation reeks of the intolerance of Islam  &mdash;  to make quite an obvious point.  Just as the mere threat of koran burning touches off riots in muslim lands, one woman&rsquo;s instigation touches off death threats and forces her into hiding.  We shouldn&rsquo;t back off in any way, we should escalate things until they finally learn that we cannot and will not be intimidated.</p>

<p>If suggesting people draw pictures of muhammad prompts death threats, the above videos would probably cause mass frothing at the mouth and wall punching fits of anger amongst our muslim friends.</p>

		<p>I pulled a gag at my local India restaurant. I threatened, like Rev. Jones, to burn copies of the Bhagawata Gita, unless menu prices were drastically lowered. The affable Indian owner and his waiters found this hilarious, but it is not a joke in Islam. The Koran is considered the sacred, absolute, literal, unquestioned word of God. One even has to put the Koran above other books on your book shelf. Freedom of expression is not an inviolable right in Islam. Europe needs take these cultural differences into account in their immigration policies. </p>

		<p>It must have been well over a year ago that Grayson Perry, a genuinely-talented British &#8220;transgressive&#8221; artist, and intermittent cross-dresser, was asked his opinion about poking fun at Islam.</p>
<p>He replied, rather sharply, that &#8220;he didn&rsquo;t particularly want his throat cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is pretty much exactly what happened to Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s Japanese translator; the crime has never been solved.</p>
<p>Says it all, really.</p>

<p>&gt; I do not know where to post this comment, because it is a bit off topic, and there is no Amren article on it, but has anyone else besides me noticed the big news story about the trail of the family extorted and murdered by two whites?  It has been in the national news for a week, with lots of commentary by the usual suspects.  I postulate that this story was picked for national discussion exactly because the perps are white.  The Christian/Newson murders did not get the same attention and discussion, did they?   Anyone notice how the admittedly awful Dutch national Van der Sloot continually reappears in that murder/disappearance case, while is two non-white accomplises, have disappeared?  </p>
<p>Everyone here knows that there is a media war going on against whites, but I felt motivated to point this particular one out.</p>
