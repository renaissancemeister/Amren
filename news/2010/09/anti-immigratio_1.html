<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An anti-immigration party in Sweden has won seats in parliament for the first time, in the latest sign that far-right parties are gaining ground in Europe.</p>
<p>The Sweden Democrats (SD), which has described growth of the country&rsquo;s Muslim minority as the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War, won 20 seats in Sunday&rsquo;s parliamentary elections, leaving the two main blocs without a majority.</p>
<p>The centre-right governing coalition, which won 49.3 per cent of the vote, has ruled out any negotiations with the far-right group, and said it would instead look to the Green Party for support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been clear.&nbsp.;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We will not co-operate with or be made dependent on the Sweden Democrats,&#8221; Fredrik Reinfeldt, the prime minister and leader of the Moderate Party, said after falling just three seats short of a majority.</p>
<p>But the leaders of the Green Party, which scored its best election result ever, appeared hesitant to a partnership with the centre-right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mandate we&rsquo;ve got from voters doesn&rsquo;t allow us to become a support party for a government with a climate policy which makes the climate goals unreachable for another 200 years,&#8221; Maria Wetterstrand, co-chair of the Green Party, told a news conference on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one from the [centre-right] Alliance has been in touch with us, neither now or earlier,&#8221; Peter Eriksson, the other co-chair, said.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats, which for the first time had created a coalition with the Green and Left parties to increase its chances of winning power, suffered a historic loss, winning just 30.9 per cent of the vote, down from 35.3 per cent in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Critics protesting</b></p>
<p>Many Swedes expressed disappointment that the Sweden Democrats won seats in the legislature. More than 6,000 protesters gathered in central Stockholm on Monday. Thousands of others, dressed in black clothes as an expression of mourning, marched in silence in Gothenburg.</p>
<p>The SD, which has been celebrating its historic entry into parliament, has dismissed fears that the party could cause legislative chaos.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t cause problems. We will take responsibility. That is my promise to the Swedish people,&#8221; Jimmie Akesson, the party&rsquo;s 31-year-old leader, said.</p>
<p>The SD has campaigned on warnings of an Islamic &#8220;growing influence&#8221; in the country. Kent Ekeroth, its international secretary, said ethnic Swedes could become &#8220;second-class citizens&#8221;.</p>
<p>The party says immigration is draining the welfare system and wants to cut asylum and immigration by relatives of people already living in Sweden by 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Immigrants make up 14 per cent of the country&rsquo;s population of 9.4 million. The largest groups of non-European immigrants in the last decade have been Iraqis and Somalis.</p>
<p>The rise of the far-right in Sweden is the latest sign that anti-immigration sentiments appear to be growing across Europe.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the anti-immigration Freedom Party, which wants to ban the Quran and shut down Islamic schools, made big gains during the June elections.</p>
<p>Hungary&rsquo;s far-right Jobbik party, which campaigned on anti-Semitism and anti-Roma sentiment, also entered parliament for the first time in April elections.</p>
<p>The French government has made headlines by launching a crackdown on Roma immigrants living in camps, while the parliament has voted in a bill that would ban face-covering veils in public.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s Northern League party, which is part of the coalition government, has also made strong gains in recent elections. Berlusconi&rsquo;s government has passed tough laws allowing authorities to fine and imprison illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Matthew Goodwin, a lecturer in politics at the University of Nottingham, Britain, told Al Jazeera the success of the SD &#8220;does reflect a broader trend both in Western  &mdash;  and increasingly Eastern Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweden historically did not have a successful ring-wing party,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially, the far-right campaigned very hard on the claim that immigrants and other minority groups were taking jobs and social housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what we have seen over the last 20 years is a shift in the discourse of the far-right, really moving towards Islamophobia.&#8221;<br>

								<h2><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE68D1Z520100914">Analysis &mdash; Anti-Immigrant Wave Spreads Across Europe</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Noah Barkin, Reuters, September 14, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Parties with xenophobic-tinged programmes are not new in Europe. The National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen has been a force in France for years, as has the Northern League, which is part of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s ruling coalition in Italy.</p>
<p>But experts say public concerns about immigration have grown in the wake of the economic crisis and politicians across Europe are scrambling like never before to exploit these fears, breaking unwritten post-war taboos along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are witnessing is not a new trend, but a deepening and acceleration of something that was in place,&#8221; said Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations (Ifri) in Paris. &#8220;These politicians are playing with fire, because feelings on this issue run very deep and may not disappear when the economy recovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>THE END OF TOLERANCE</p>
<p>Wilders [Geert Wilders], who wants to ban the Koran and expel Muslims who commit crimes, has emerged in the span of a few months as arguably the most powerful politician in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>After an inconclusive June election, centre-right parties are relying on Wilders to form a minority government that could give him major sway over policy. If this coalition fails to come together and a new election is held, polls show his Freedom Party (PVV) would be the top vote getter.</p>
<p>In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy has taken pre-emptive action to prevent similar gains for the far-right National Front, announcing a crackdown on Roma people and criminals of foreign origin that has earned him rebukes from a United Nations human rights body and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>In Italy, which received the most immigrants of any EU country last year, Umberto Bossi&rsquo;s Northern League has wielded huge influence over domestic policy, pushing through tough laws that allow authorities to fine and imprison illegal immigrants, and even punish people who provide them with shelter.</p>
<p>Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society Institute in Brussels, says more European politicians are realising that by focussing on immigration, they can tap into voter fears about a range of issues  &mdash;  from the economy and jobs, to globalisation, change and an increasingly uncertain future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UPSETTING THE SYSTEM</p>
<p>One such country is Sweden, where an anti-immigrant party looks poised to vault the four percent hurdle in a September 19 election and enter parliament for the first time.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Danish People&rsquo;s Party, the Sweden Democrats have shed their skinhead image in favour of smart suits and a carefully calibrated message that emphasises support for Israel and women&rsquo;s rights alongside what party leader Jimmie Akesson describes as a &#8220;common sense&#8221; aversion to Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>If the party does make it into parliament, it could deprive centre-right Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt of a majority and force him to consider working with a party he has described as &#8220;right-wing, xenophobic and populist&#8221;.</p>
<p>In Germany, where the collective memory of the Nazis has limited the influence of far-right parties, the emergence of a new anti-immigrant force could have even more serious implications for the political system.</p>
<p>The rise of the new Left party and Greens in recent decades means that six parties now sit in the federal parliament in Berlin, a splintering that has severely complicated the formation of stable coalitions at the federal level.</p>
<p>Were a seventh party, led by Stadtkewitz or a more high-profile anti-immigrant crusader, to make it above the five percent threshold and enter the Bundestag it would shake Germany&rsquo;s political landscape to the core.</p>

<p>&#8220;If racists are allowed to vote, then democracy&rsquo;s flaw is a threat to human rights and global dignity. We must reform our voting laws to reflect inclusion and tolerance. No racist votes!&#8221;   You heard it here first.  Beware.</p>

<p>If there wasn&rsquo;t a problem to begin with, they would not have gotten the votes that they did.</p>
<p>And there is a problem.</p>
<p>The voters are merely responding in what they see as an appropriate response. And this is a reason for &#8220;mourning&#8221;?</p>
<p>At least among &#8220;some&#8221; it is a reason for mourning. Some being a very subjective word.</p>
<p>The Swedes, &#8220;some&#8221; merely want to keep Sweden Swedish. I know that is hard for &#8220;some&#8221; to understand.</p>

		<p>Batten down the hatches, Noah Barkin!  Change - the good kind - at last is coming to Europe.  Call it &#8220;xenophobia,&#8221; if you will, but Europeans increasingly are behaving in a way that any healthy organism behaves when faced with an invasion.  It&rsquo;s dawned on them that playing the happy host is slow-motion suicide.  Sweden Democrats are helping to lead the way.     </p>

		<p>Rather than expend ink on speculating why whites are voting in opposition to immigration, journalists should be digging for the reasons governments support immigration.</p>
<p>Once it is laid bare under the microscope that mass Third World immigration is mainly about economic aggrandizement for the benefit of global elites, the answers will be self-evident. </p>

		<p> Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it, how the writer of the first news item seems to approve of Reinfeldt&rsquo;s refusal to consider a coalition with the Sweden Democrats? Wonder how he&rsquo;d feel if the Communists held those 20 seats, and were otherwise in the same position now as the SD, and a prime minister refused to consider working with them? Would he be accused of &#8220;McCarthyism&#8221;, or the European equivalent, assuming there is any?</p>
<p> Also, it&rsquo;s interesting that in the second, editorial piece, the writer uses the fact that Europeans have become &#8220;comfortable&#8221; since World War II, and feel threatened by the Muslim hordes in their midst, as some type of a scornful, anti-White accusation. Is being &#8220;comfortable&#8221; morally wrong? Is being afraid that people of alien blood, appearance and beliefs will take over the land you grew up in and love, somehow &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;xenophobic&#8221;?</p>
<p> And how pray tell are these politicians &#8220;playing with fire&#8221; when they try to legislate what a clear majority of their constituents want? And why are politicians who address the concerns of constituents, accused of trying to &#8220;exploit fears&#8221;? Clever, isn&rsquo;t it, how writers can distort reality with carefully placed words?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Far-right, far-right, far-right&hellip;enough already!!!&#8221; The so-called &#8220;far-right&#8221; today, whether in Sweden, France or America, are people with beliefs and ideas no more radical than the average person in any of these lands only a few generations ago.<br>
The media doesn&rsquo;t even pretend to be neutral or unbiased on these matters and it is abundantly clear which side they fall-in with. </p>
<p>With that said, if even the notoriously liberal Sweden is seeing gains on the political right, that is great news indeed! Good luck my Scandinavian brothers and sisters!!</p>

		<p>The real &#8220;danger&#8221; here is that the &#8220;far right&#8221; will dismantle socialism, kick out non-white invaders and bring prosperity and sanity back to Sweden (and the rest of europe).</p>
<p>Articles like this make it sound like desperate people will adopt any ideology, even a bad one, if it promises change.  The reality is that communism and identity politics are causing most of the problems in the world.  Few people understand how.  But most will understand that where the left failed to bring them peace and prosperity, the far right succeeds.  That will permanently turn people away from communism and bring strong support for white nationalism.</p>
<p>Alot of the white nationalists look at white people in the western world as fat, lazy, corrupt and too concerned with comfort to support racial concerns.  Much of that is propaganda spread by the same communists who are causing racial strife all over the world.  It is a distortion of reality.</p>
<p>Because the truth of the matter is white nationalism a competitive ideology. What I mean by that is people are always looking for the best choice in where to place their allegiance for their own best self interests and, more to the point, their families.  ANY ideology that provides real solutions for their problems, puts food on the table and makes where they live, free and secure (ie gives safety while not being a police state) enjoys wide support.</p>
<p>White nationalism will catch on to the exact extent these things are provided.  And the time has never been better for demonstrating this.  The communists have decided we should all live in degraded, slave like conditions, with no recourse to anything else.  They have severely miscalculated.  Because there ARE choices.</p>
<p>The Swedes are in the process of making them.  Once this bears fruit, they will whole heartedly embrace this.  And others, seeing them reap the benefits will want the same for themselves.</p>

		<p>I find it interesting that a party that supports Sweden&rsquo;s large welfare state but is against high levels of third world immigration inevitably gets labeled as &#8220;far right&#8221;.  Clearly the only political position you need to have to be outed as &#8220;far right&#8221; is to be in favor of the interests of white people.</p>
<p>So to avoid the opprobrium of getting the &#8220;far right&#8221;, &#8220;fascist&#8221;, or &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; label, politicians adopt explicitly anti-white positions.  They are lauded by the media, and all the great and the good, for this.<br>

		<p>Why are some Swedes dressed in mourning clothes, simply because a political party that promises to champion the cause of native Swedes, gained seats as a result of a democratic plebiscite? Would those Swedes rather be governed by the likes of Saddam Hussein or not governed at all, given they seem to love Iraqis and Somalis. so much?</p>
<p>I see the average Swede&rsquo;s view of Bantus in America is still shaped by Gunnar Myrdal and &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Morons one and all&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Immigrants make up 14 per cent of the country&rsquo;s population of 9.4 million. The largest groups of non-European immigrants in the last decade have been Iraqis and Somalis.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s their birth rate in terms of generation years and total expecteds per lifetime female?  Do Swedes honestly think that if a hostile foreign power (for such is what Islam really is) can gain control through birth rate, they will choose to &#8216;share power&rsquo; by political accomodation?</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Voter turnout: 82.1%<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>What happens when 30% of the voting nation is of foreign extraction, in 20 years?  Not only will you see even more divisive breakup of national governments into factionalized partisan fragments but the idea that there could be MORE (forced) welfare transfers and &#8216;family reunification&rsquo; type immigration deals must also be expected.  Since the new group, now knowing they are resented and unwelcome, will legitimately seek to empower themselves, not local Swedes.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;right-wing, xenophobic and populist&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Since when do elitist white trash that WANT a horde of unassimilable (read, import but do not wish to breed with) foreigners get off using the term &#8216;populist&rsquo; to talk about their VOTING CONSTITUENCY!?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, since democracy became a joke where the candidates are fixed by higher ups in the enablement and industrial power politics and the voters only get to pick from a range of pre-vetted (neutered) candidates whose policies are not their&rsquo;s to own.</p>
<p>The sadness about all of this is that:</p>
<p>1.  We _still_ do not have definitive proof as to whether genetics for IQ and Social Conformity are evenly or unequally distributed among all humans.  IMO, it&rsquo;s quite likely that until that answer is made (i.e. until China breaks the PC barrier with long-sequence IQ searches) we will NEVER have a &#8216;definitive answer&rsquo; as to how right racism is or isn&rsquo;t.  Post-miscegenation, with a globalist population of idiots with low regard for social adherence to the rule of law will be too damn late.</p>
<p>2.  It looks to me like someone, somewhere, is stirring up trouble with a _deliberate_ racialist angle.  So that mass intervention at the national level can be enforced, externally.  In Europe, this is particularly worrisome because the EU Ruling Junta is linked too closely to the Euro-Arab Dialogue nations whose masses of unwashed are the principle cause of the problems they are now undergoing.</p>
<p>Someone should really be able to ask the question: &#8220;Why is the desire to be white, in white nations, with a history of success in developing our own societies, technologies and culture such a bad thing that the failure nations of the planet all have to be invited in to make it worse?&#8221;</p>
<p>We certainly aren&rsquo;t in their nations in any major way.</p>
<p>If there is no legitimate answer to this basic question, it&rsquo;s time to start looking for ulterior motives on the part of the elites and nailing them down until they finally start answering truthfully what it is they think they are doing AGAINST OUR WISHES!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Sweden Democrats (SD), which has described growth of the country&rsquo;s Muslim minority as the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War, won 20 seats in Sunday&rsquo;s parliamentary elections, leaving the two main blocs without a majority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How interesting, besides France and the UK, I have always seen Sweden as a sort of &ldquo;lost country.&rdquo; I expect this sort of reactionary and healthy politics ongoing and inevitably victorious in: Eastern Europe, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, the Baltic Countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and of course (back and forth) Australia and New Zeeland, but not Sweden. It has such a fine pedigree of safely snooty &ldquo;multiculturalism.&rdquo; If you need evidence, the reaction of the  Social Democrats, with such a minuscule margin of maneuvering to form a coalition and a government in rejecting a compromise with the SD, is very telling. More telling still, is how these &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; buffoons are being snubbed by the Greens. Sweden is about to make auto-meatballs of its &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; and elitist meatheads.</p>
<p>Islam is like heroine, to any Western country already intoxicated with the Red wine of multiculturalism; it enhances the pleasant fantasy and  psychedelic stupor, until it finally overdoses the individual and brings death. This is what is happening to the political &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; in Europe, except their morbid addiction is destroying everything around them and not just themselves in the process.</p>
<p>So if the only option for the Social Democrats is to force a new election rather than form a government with The Sweden Democrats, I say let them do so!</p>
<p>My hope for the outcome of that kind of farce, is that The Sweden Democrats gain 50 to 100 seats in that next round of hide and seek the truth in a polling station!!!</p>

		<p>This is great news, and it&rsquo;s also a good reminder of the advantages of a proportional representative system.</p>
<p>Something tells me a lot of people in this country who are more or less on the same side as the Sweden Democrats on many issues will find a myriad of nitpicking excuses to not wholeheartedly congratulate them for their success. My suggestion to these people is to shut it. Anti-immigration nationalists are facing an uphill battle wherever they stand up and fight - the last thing they need is to have to worry about defending their backs at the same time. If you are a more capable activist, then please, show us your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Sweden Democrats. Lead the way for the rest of us white Europeans around the world, if you can.</p>

		<p>This is good news.  Europeans have discovered the true definition of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; is white displacement in their ancestral lands by Africans and Moslems.  The fact that Somalis are the biggest non-European group in Sweden is unforgivable.  You literally couldn&rsquo;t find a more alien culture on this planet.  </p>
<p>The first thing to do is expulsion of non-European lineage from Europe.  Second is to hold responsible those who allowed and promoted this insane ideology of white displacement.  Third is to never allow it to happen again. </p>

<p>If democracy gets in the way, then democracy  is the problem. Democracy must go. </p>

They are not interested in gentlemanly rules of conduct (except when they are winning).   If they lose at the ballot box, they won&rsquo;t accept the results &hellip; they will take it to the streets.   Be prepared! </p>
<p>Europe is approaching  a crucial historical point where it will have to decide whether or not it will still remain &#8220;Europe&#8221;   &mdash;   other than as a piece of geography on the map.

		<p>&#8220;The [Swedish Democrat} party says immigration is draining the welfare system.&#8221;  <br>
 <br>
The Swedish Democrat Party does not seem to want to dismantle Swedish Social Democracy.  Instead it agrees with liberal columnist Paul Krugman, who wrote in his column, &#8220;if you&rsquo;re going to assure health care and a decent income to everyone, you can&rsquo;t make that offer global.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration, especially third world immigration, interferes with everything else liberals want to do.  It is environmentally costly.  It contributes to the income gap.  A heterogeneous work force is more difficult to organize into labor unions than a homogenous work force.   In the United States it is one of the reasons most white working class people vote Republican.  <br>

		<p>In voting, Sweden uses paper ballots.</p>
<p>BUT there is no secret voting.  Everyone in the room sees who you vote for.  There is a paper ballot for each political party.  You choose it from a ballot box, then make tick marks on the ballot, then turn it in&hellip;hand it over to one of the election officials.</p>
<p>Now that you know this, it is amazing that the Sweden Democrats did so well.  There is incredible social pressure to conform.</p>
<p>There has been a facebook coordinated protest in Stockholm (10,000 people), Goteborg (5,000 people) and Malmo (3,000 people) to protest the &#8216;racist&rsquo; Sweden Democrats and that they should not be allowed to be seated in Parliament.</p>
<p>The SD party website has been hacked and the names, addresses and phone numbers of 5,400 party members are being made public.  Sounds like what happened to the British National Party website sometime earlier.  Remember the British ballerina who lost her job in the ballet when her membership status was discovered?</p>
<p>There is some good video of the &#8216;protest&rsquo; in Sergel torg in Stockholm on the Aftonbladet website.  At 35 seconds into the video, the reporter interviews a couple; the guy is a black Somali and the girl is a white Swede.  It runs to about the 56 second mark.  It is not immediately apparent but they are holding hands - isn&rsquo;t lovey-dovey great?  The girl is a doll.  Watch her and his eye movements and how she carries herself.</p>
<p>If you roll over to the Aftonbladet video site, look for the headline that contains &#8220;mot SD&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aftonbladet.se</p>
<p>The Sweden Democrats pulled 10.5 percent of the vote in the province of Skane.  That is in the south of the country.  There are a lot of muslims in Malmo raping and robbing and causing a crime wave.  I don&rsquo;t recall the province Malmo is in, but I don&rsquo;t think it is Skane.  Nationally, the SD pulled 4.5 percent.  So the closer the Swedish voter is to cultural enrichment, the more he votes Sweden Democrat.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a white South African and as such can honestly say that the experiment of multiculturalism is a failure. It will also fail elsewhere, exactly as it has failed in South Africa. </p>
<p>A lot of people in Europe are waking up to this fact. Once they realise that it isn&rsquo;t racist to point out the obvious, then the failing experiment, called multiculturalism, will be over.</p>
<p>The reason multiclturalism is being promoted, is that is seen as vehicle to promote gloalism. When societies are Nationalist globalism cannot occur. Thus Nationalism in any form is the arc enemy of globalism.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is the vehicle chosen to destroy nationalism, because societies cannot be Nationalist if they comprise of a multitude of cultures.</p>
<p>The globalists got it totally wrong, because multiculturalism in reality PROMOTES Nationalism.<br>
They were on the right track with the incessant programming via the mass media, but they are yet to themselves realise that multiculturalism is a failure and that the agenda thereof has set them back decades.</p>
<p>Fact: Multiculturalism promotes Nationalism. (Once the immigrant levels rise to a certain point)</p>

		<p>Sweden was run for generations by socialists, who as the years passed simply got nuttier and nuttier.<br>
 Basically, they overplayed their hand, by stealth they foisted the most extreme immigration policy possible (something the &#8216;no borders&rsquo; crowd in the USA and UK can only dream of) on to the poor unsuspecting Swedish people.It was all about ideology &#8216;citizens of the world&rsquo; and all that childish garbage, but the head honchos of Swedish socialism were actually stupid enough to really believe that guff.<br>
 The end result is that ethnic Swedes are periously close to being disestablished in their own native land, what&rsquo;s more many of the immigrants are from particularly unpleasant and troublesome ethnicities.<br>
 The Swedes have finally woken up.But alas, it is too late.<br>

It doesn&rsquo;t seem anyone wants to talk about those places and times where there were no economic fluctuations as in the U.S. from the late 1930s to the 1960s, but since then each economic downturn has gotten worse.

The blame for the rise of the &#8220;extreme right&#8221; can be directly put on the shoulders of the moronic immigration policies that have prevailed in Europe over the past fifty or so years.  There is no sensible reason that non-white peoples should be living in the breeding space of the Europeans.

<p>Thank you for stating it so well. I too respect human diversity. I have nothing against other peoples or races. I wish them all well.  But in order to preserve them, and ourselves,  we need a certain amount of separation.  Each population group needs its own homeland, its own breeding ground, its own nesting place so to speak.</p>
<p>It is these busybody social engineers, these multiculty fanatics, who are determined to push  &#8220;diversity&#8221; on us, who are actually destroying that very diversity that they pretend to worship. Don&rsquo;t they see the hypocrisy in that?   Yes, there will be an interesting diversity lasting for a few generations &hellip;  but ultimately we will end up looking like Egypt or Brasil  or so many other miscegenated places, where only the tiny ruling class remains white and everyone else is a scrambled mass of unidentifiable genes.   Worker bees, indeed!</p>

Whites in the United States are stuck with our large black population.  They are our collective punishment for allowing the slave trade.<br>
 <br>
There is no reason any white or east Asian country should allow black immigration, with the possible exception of exceptional individuals.  Blacks are dangerous and inferior.  They are dangerous and inferior for genetic reasons, so there is no reason to hope that contact with whites will improve them.  There is no value in a large black population.  Those people bring social problems wherever they go.  <br>

<p> &#8220;Yes, I&rsquo;m worried about where this country and its inhabitants are heading as the support for SD [SwedenDemocrats] continuously increases. A party that bases their arguments on fiction and not on facts. A party which many of its members are former nazis. I&rsquo;m glad that Fredrik Reinfeldt (M), the prime minister of Sweden, is still confident on that they will do whatever they can so that SD won&rsquo;t get influence in Swedish politics. </p>
<p> &#8220;I also think it was strong and admirable by Lars Ohly (Left-wing party) that <b>he wouldn&rsquo;t even be in the same room as the leader of SD, Jimmie Åkesson! </b> But still, I&rsquo;m wondering what the h*** is wrong with 5.7% of the Swedish population.&#8221; <br>

<p>That girl says she can&rsquo;t believe that 5.7% of the Swedish [voters} want a party that&rsquo;s against immigration.</p>
<p>Very much to the contrary, I find it hard to believe that ONLY 5.7% of Swedes are concerned about immigration! <br>
That indifference can only be explained by their lack of access to information.</p>
<p>I am wondering what is &#8220;wrong&#8221; with the other 94.3%!</p>
<p>I am also amazed at the childish, spiteful  petulance of the leftwing politicians who refuse to deal with   &mdash;   <i>or even be in the same room with </i>(!!!)  &mdash;   the opposition leaders&hellip;. whom they have turned into horrible demons that pollute the very air. </p>

A simple google seach shows that the phrase &#8220;far right&#8221; has many more hits than &#8220;far left&#8221;.  A search on google trends suggests that &#8220;far right&#8221; is searched twice as popular a search term as &#8220;far left&#8221; as well.    </p>

		<p>one should think about why this is happening e.g the dutch (i am dutch living in oz) they are a most tolerant people and if that tolerance is coming to an end it is not becuase of xenophobia but because muslims are not tolerant of others. I watched a tv debate here last night where muslims we the loudest and most agressive in demanding their rights ignoring our cultural rights. If i appear in wearing a full face mask i would be abused and seen as criminal suspect&hellip;.just try walking into a bank with one on&hellip; We have have a culture where we do not cover faces in public and see such covering as a threat, and that is the only objection most ozzies have about islam. I find it offensive and agressiove to see such public covering and children are frightened by such. Now the attitude of people who do so for the reason of &#8220;modesty&#8221; in fact are judging women who do not as sluts and whores&hellip;so who is being intolerant&hellip;. it is islam just ask the dutch. no birka no nijab no sharia and i am all for keeping those who want these aberrations to our normal public order out of what ever counrty does not have it as a cultural trait ie non muslim countries. In muslim countries you do not have the &#8220;freedom&#8221; they are demanding we give them&hellip;..just ask the british couple who were going to be whipped for showing affection in public ie kissing!! Or the many who get arrested for not wearing &#8220;modeswt&#8221; clothes&hellip; they scream for our blood for offending them yet demand we must take no offence at anything they do.  &#8220;Western&#8221; Muslims (we have to tolerate them but they do not tolerate us) live by double standards and that is what is becoming apparent. </p>

&#8221;I find it interesting that a party that supports Sweden&rsquo;s large welfare state but is against high levels of third world immigration inevitably gets labeled as &ldquo;far right&rdquo;. Clearly the only political position you need to have to be outed as &ldquo;far right&rdquo; is to be in favor of the interests of white people&#8221;.</p>
<p>How true but I would expect nothing less than this pure unadulterated bigotry from the controlled media brainwashers, owned by the Marxist/globalist banking/political elite.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Nazi&#8221; smear has been used as a tool by the Left to demonise nationalism ever since the end of WWII. The Nazis were tried and convicted at Nuremberg because of their treatment of those ideologically opposed to them, including the Jews and many other groups. The Nazis killed millions but the Communist USSR killed tens of millions in that wonderful atheist experiment but not one Communist state has brought these Communists to justice and I&rsquo;ve never heard of our wonderful press brainwashers or our Western governments demand justice be served on the Marxist mass murderers though &#8220;Nazis&#8221; were hunted for decades to every corner of the earth. </p>
<p>Now today those nationalists who oppose Marxism/globalism like the Sweden Democrats &amp; Nick Griffin and the BNP in the UK are demonised and called &#8220;far-right&#8221;, &#8220;Nazis&#8221; or &#8220;racists&#8221;. Strange that, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s almost seems as if those who ran the USSR &amp; those who smear nationalist as &#8220;Nazis&#8221;  are one and the same group with the same ideology. It&rsquo;s time for the various groups in white-majority countries to &#8220;bury the hatchet&#8221;, forget past enmities (but you may still retain your individual spiritual beliefs), recognise just who our real enemies are, and get on with the serious work of saving Western civilisation. </p>
<p>The attack on Western Civilisation by the Frankfurt School Marxists is deadly serious but should be looked upon by all European-descended nationalists as a unique opportunity for them to unite the European-descended peoples for the first time in history. Now that&rsquo;s something worth striving for.</p>

		<p>In Europe, this is particularly worrisome because the EU Ruling Junta is linked too closely to the Euro-Arab Dialogue nations whose masses of unwashed are the principle cause of the problems they are now undergoing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You severely overstate the case.  There is no &#8220;ruling junta&#8221; in europe (although I bet lust at the possibility of such keeps many a leftist up at night).  They have no military.  Remember that.  Their sole recourse to get what they want is manipulation of the media and the money system.  And the latter (the euro) is collapsing.</p>
<p>It seems, that over the last several decades, communism has wormed its way into much of the western world.  However, the communists have a fatal flaw.  When push comes to shove, they can&rsquo;t handle the power.  Literally, they cannot effectively run their new world order.  It&rsquo;s collapsing right out of the starting gate, mostly because their choice of non-whites as a base of power is a very, very poor one.</p>
<p>The task for white nationalism isn&rsquo;t so much challenging these people for power (elected or otherwise) as it is filling the incredible power vacuum they leave behind as they panic or just come to the conclusion it all just isn&rsquo;t worth the hassle.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t celebrate yet: the traitors to the Swedish nation (i.e., essentially the entire political class there) have not given up yet.  Just this afternoon, a lead article appeared in the principal Swedish daily &#8220;Aftonbladet&#8221; called, &#8220;Here are the votes which determine the election,&#8221; which boasted that the unfinished counting of overseas ballots and late absentee ballots might still both allow a victory for Reinfeldt&rsquo;s Riksdag alliance and deny the Sweden Democrats their entry into the national legislature.  The article quotes the vote counters joking [?] about &#8220;stealing&#8221; votes or &#8220;losing&#8221; ballot boxes.<p>Also, as of yesterday, the Aftonbladet has a banner at the top of the site page proclaiming &#8220;We don&rsquo;t like xenophobia. We like difference [olika].&#8221;  The banner has a reader ballot feature that ONLY allows the reader to register a vote to &#8220;support&#8221; this &#8220;campaign&#8221; for &#8220;difference.&#8221;<p>Don&rsquo;t ever expect our opponents anywhere in the world to fight fair, or to hold themselves to the rules they will insist we observe.</p></p></p>

<p>I disagree. 5% is very meaningful in the political system of most European democracies.</p>
<p>In Sweden today, neither the right nor the left are able to form a government coalition without including either one of the parties on the other side or the Sweden Democrats. Thus, whoever wants to govern will probably promise anti-immigration measures in return for the Sweden Democrats approval.</p>
<p>Besides, 5% of people choosing to vote for a previously fringe party is a lot. It doesn&rsquo;t just mean that only 5% are aware of the danger posed by foreigners, it means that 5% are concerned to the points that they&rsquo;ll break a political taboo. It&rsquo;s the tip of the iceberg. The actual number of people who are more anti-immigration than pro-immigration must be enormously greater.</p>

<p> Arab nations had ten times the African slaves as any White nation! Africans themselves had African slaves! I have never felt any guilt whatsoever about black slavery and never will. </p>
<p>Seems to me that Whites are the real slaves used by the whole world to give and give till we bleed and then give some more. How many hundreds of trillions do you think we have spent supporting blacks all over the world and in the USA? How many White lives have been lost/destroyed by these same blacks? Collective punishment belongs to the African race as far as I am concerned. </p>
<p>You can wish all the nonwhite races well if you want to,(more altruism, feel good jargon) but don&rsquo;t expect the same coming from them.</p>

<p>Not so. If you knew your history, you would know that we  did not allow the slave trade, and we put put a stop to the further importation of slaves as soon as we became independent and had the power to do so.</p>

		<p>So many good posts here&hellip; *** 58,56,55,46 and others.. One thing we NEED to realize&hellip; The closer we come to clarifying the tricks and motives of our enemies&hellip; (the enemies of indigenous Euro culture/genes)&hellip;.  the more desperate and vile they will become. Open communication allowed on sites like AMREN are hated by these hyena/parasitic types&hellip; that cannot achieve the higher dignity themselves, thus do all they can to undermine and confuse (those who can&hellip; thanks to the more dilligent homework of their particular, Euro anscestors). There will always be animosity between the Cains and Abels of this world and the true minority&rsquo;s/numerically) will always be those that achieve through dilligence the higher potentials of being human/Abels. However True independance is not achieved buy ruling and using people less evolved but by being perfectly sufficient with out them . The ruler and ruled are co-dependents.  Just some thoughts&hellip;</p>
