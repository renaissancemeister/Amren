<h1>Feds Sue Arizona Sheriff in Civil Rights Probe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacques Billeaud, Google News, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Justice Department sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Thursday, saying the Arizona lawman refused for more than a year to turn over records in an investigation into allegations his department discriminates against Hispanics.</p>
<p>The lawsuit calls Arpaio and his office&rsquo;s defiance &#8220;unprecedented,&#8221; and said the federal government has been trying since March 2009 to get officials to comply with its probe of alleged discrimination, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and having English-only policies in his jails that discriminate against people with limited English skills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio&rsquo;s office had said it has fully cooperated in the jail inquiry but won&rsquo;t hand over additional documents into the examination of the alleged unconstitutional searches because federal authorities haven&rsquo;t said exactly what they were investigating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latest action against Arizona by the federal government, which earlier sued the state to stop its strict new immigration law that requires police officers to question people about their immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arpaio believes the inquiry is focused on his immigration sweeps, patrols where deputies flood an area of a city  &mdash;  in some cases heavily Latino areas  &mdash;  to seek out traffic violators and arrest other offenders.</p>
<p>Critics say his deputies pull people over for minor traffic infractions because of the color of their skin so they can ask them for their proof of citizenship.</p>
<p>Arpaio denies allegations of racial profiling, saying people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they&rsquo;ve committed crimes and that it&rsquo;s only afterward that deputies find many of them are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office has said half of the 1,032 people arrested in the sweeps have been illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the nearly $113 million that the county received from the federal government accounted for about 5 percent of the county&rsquo;s $2 billion budget. Arpaio&rsquo;s office said it receives $3 million to $4 million each year in federal funds.</p>

		<p>How can I sue thee?  Let me count the ways.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Feds have three lawsuits against governments in AZ   &mdash;   This one, the junior college suit mentioned here at AR earlier this week, and the suit against SB 1070.  </p>
<p>On the flip side, this probably means that both Harry Mitchell and Gabrielle Giffords will be looking for new jobs in January.  Terry Goddard&rsquo;s status as newly unemployed in January was pretty much set in stone when Jan Brewer signed 1070.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not beyond the realm of possibility that this black run justice department will screw up even worse and push Arizona so far it will have no other option than to call in the National Guard to protect them from the federal government, deputizing each one as employees of the various counties of Arizona, taking legal control out of the hands of the Gestapo community organizer and his Herr Goebbles in the Justice Dept.</p>
<p>Texas could likely follow suit, since they too are on the verge of a head to head with the Washington blacks.  </p>
<p>Both states could also declare secession in the process of it all.  While that&rsquo;s going on, I would look for at least a dozen more states to do the same thing, but going only so far as declaring secession&hellip;&hellip;AT FIRST.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible we are building a possible 1861 scenario all over again.</p>
<p>This is what happens when white gullible fools elect a black, expecting him to be non-racial and fair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;and intelligent.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that this community organizer refuses to allow his records to be released, because they probably would show just another dense black who is able to articulate a little bit, and for that reason and that reason alone he has been heralded as above average his entire life.</p>
<p>As bad as he and his administration are, the fawning fools in the media are FAR FAR worse, because it is they who gave him a pass on everything, admitting AFTER he was elected they knew NOTHING about him.</p>
<p>This is the biggest scam ever perpetrated on the public, and it will see this empire torn apart in conflict. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite amazing how heavily the Obama Admin is coming down on Arizona. Combine these extremely punitive measures against Arizona with their usual lax enforcement of immigration laws and what message are they sending? What are their policy goals? </p>
<p>I think the message they&rsquo;re sending is pretty clear: these actions are part of an ongoing assault against the native-born white middle class, especially the white lower middle class. They don&rsquo;t just want to drive down the standard of living for the white middle class, they want to marginalize their culture and identity, and dispossess them of the country their fathers built. It&rsquo;s that serious and it&rsquo;s well underway.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s obvious that the federal government, under the Mulatto Messiah, is terrified of Sheriff Arpaio, and is trying desperately to bring him down, by hook or by crook.</p>
<p> Why? Because Arpaio has refused to be intimidated by the feds, and is doing what he believes is best for the people of Arizona. How dare he?! We had a sheriff many years ago in the county where I live. He was a tough, no-nonsense sheriff who wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate any nonsense, and who got results. He hasn&rsquo;t been matched here since. And many of us who are of the &#8220;older&#8221; generations, still remember him fondly. He was kind of an earlier-day, small town Joe Arpaio. I think he and Sheriff Arpaio would have gotten along famously.</p>

		<p>Arizona fails again.</p>
<p>We should be hearing Gov. Brewer calling for a state convention to audit and shame the Feds for failure to protect Arizona&rsquo;s legal White citizens from the non white invaders.</p>
<p>Every other state should send representatives carrying official  resolutions of support and resolutions of no confidence in Obama.</p>
<p>You would think that politicians would do this already, even as a campaign stunt.</p>
<p>Until the citizens embrace the Spirit of the Ky. and Va. Resolutions of 1798-9, we should remain demoralized and hopeless and listlessly waiting for our neighborhoods to become third world ghettos and nowhere left to escape or hide.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming.</p>

		<p>So close to the solution.</p>
<p>Simply ignore the federal government.  Once one state does it, they all will.  But one state has to do it to reveal that Obama is a paper tiger.</p>
<p>Will it be arizona? After November, will it matter?</p>

		<p>The federal government under Obama is suing any individual and any state or local government that dares to try enforcing immigration law.  Obama is adamant that immigration law never be enforced.  The current policy of ICE is to deport illegal aliens <i>only</i> if they have committed a felony.  But <i>legal</i> non-citizen immigrants are also deported if they commit a felony.  So our government now officially makes no distinction whatsoever between legal and illegal immigrants.  Indeed, the only difference is that legal immigrants have to go through more hoops to get in.<br>

		<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s heavy handed meddling is going to blow up in their faces. And they couldn&rsquo;t have picked a worse issue to do it with. Most people support Arizona and when they see stuff like this they start to realize the administration is out of touch and out of control.</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s administration reminds me of the post-Civil-War Radical Reconstruction, in which blacks were given the ability to assume power in the South.  Instead of taking things slowly, most insisted on immediate school integration and intermarriage rights.  Many demanded total power over whites, and the most ill-bred among them manifested their new might by shoving old white women off the sidewalks.  Obama and his henchmen seem to have an uncontrollable urge to get back at white people, even at the price of losing Congress and reelection.  He&rsquo;s clearly nearing the point at which a state (and then states) will refuse to comply with some federal edict, and then he&rsquo;ll be faced with the prospect of sending troops or doing nothing.  Either choice will destroy him completely.  </p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t unexpected. But the fedgov has bitten off more than they can chew by going after Sheriff Arpaio. He&rsquo;s cool as a cucumber and knows he&rsquo;s in the right. They can&rsquo;t touch him. Remember the old saying, they can &#8220;indict (bring suit against) a ham sandwich.&#8221; It&rsquo;s getting the verdict which is the hard part. Arpaio and Arizona will beat this latest fedgov nonsense.</p>

		<p>The DOJ is a never ending source of amusement and amazement. They won&rsquo;t prosecute Black Panthers who intimidate voters at the polling stations, but they will go after Sheriff Joe, Governor Brewer and a ball player who might have fibbed about taking steroids.<br>
