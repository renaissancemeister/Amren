			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jackie Valley, Las Vegas Sun, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Metro Police issued 92 traffic-related citations across the Las Vegas Valley on Monday as part of an annual effort to boost safety near schools. But the operation prompted a complaint by the NAACP.</p>
<p>The NAACP alleged that jaywalking tickets handed out to parents near Kermit R. Booker Sr. Empowerment Elementary School unfairly penalized people who live in a low-income area.</p>
<p>NAACP officials, who are demanding the tickets be dismissed, said in a statement that &#8220;the actions of Metro officers have tainted the memory of this day for many parents and children at Booker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Metro, however, said it is simply targeting schools that have a history of traffic-related problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Faulis [Lt. John Faulis of Metro&rsquo;s traffic bureau] said officers issued 14 jaywalking tickets Monday, including four near Booker, along Martin Luther King Boulevard in west Las Vegas. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;With the start of school, one of our No. 1 priorities in the traffic bureau is to keep kids safe,&#8221; Faulis said. &#8220;People all over the summer, they&rsquo;re used to driving a little bit faster and not having to pay attention to school zones.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Richard Boulware, chairperson of NAACP&rsquo;s legal redress committee, said police should have notified school officials about the enforcement so they could have warned parents, he said.</p>
<p>Plus, Boulware said the symbolism of minority children witnessing police giving their parents tickets on the first day of school works against efforts to create a &#8220;strong relationship between the minority community and the police department.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP said Booker parents think using the crosswalk parallel to Martin Luther King Boulevard is more dangerous than crossing directly in front of the school, where there tends to be less traffic.</p>
<p>Faulis, however, urged pedestrians to use the crosswalks because traffic engineering studies have determined them to be the safest place to cross the street. He also pointed out that of 50 traffic-related fatalities this year, 17 have been pedestrians.</p>

		<p>Geezo, could we have written a MSM newspaper article that has more verbal ironies and regurgitated cliches than this one?  From the school named &#8220;Empowerment,&#8221; to MLK Blvd running through the area, and ending with the long-repeated &#8220;strong community-police relationship&#8221; bromide, this one is just too much.</p>
<p>The irony is that Las Vegas&rsquo;s civil rights groups, perhaps even the NAACP, demanded these safety patrols to begin with.</p>

This is just a wordier version of a perennial black complaint, &#8220;He dissed me!&#8221;, AKA &#8216;dis&rsquo; or &#8216;disrespect&rsquo;, offered regardless of a justifiable reason for the sanction.  The police have attacked the egos of the Mr. Boulware&rsquo;s followers by expecting them to follow rules.  </p>
<p>Every imposed consequence for bad behavior is an outrage to an entitlement-minded egotist.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t know about this situation specifically, but walking in traffic is quite the black thing.  I have lived in five cities in four states and it&rsquo;s been the same everywhere: blacks crossing often very busy streets against the light as slowly and attitudinally as they can.  It&rsquo;s part of their entitlement and &#8220;screw you&#8221; mentalities.  Anything to inconvenience those actually doing something productive.</p>

<p>Pretty much says it all.  Remember the old saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s a black thing&hellip;.you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&#8221;.  This issue is an example.</p>
<p>But the truth is, we (white people) CAN understand.  The problem is the understanding of such things is not pleasant.  It boils down to blacks wanting to be free, not to do as they wish, but to of the consequences inherit in their decisions.  or even more disturbing, an inability to understand the link between the two&hellip;. at all.</p>
<p>The lesson to be learned from this video clip is not that these two idiots paid a high price for misbehaving&hellip;.but rather they were incapable of ever considering the possibility that this would be the result.  It was FUNNY to them because, lacking this understanding, white rules of not &#8220;jaywalking&#8221; make no sense.  They seem like unreasonable restrictions, selectively enforced.  Not seeing any white people ticketed for jaywalking, they do not understand that&rsquo;s because there are no whites jaywalking.  And they don&rsquo;t understand that whites aren&rsquo;t jaywalking at other times because there is a risk involved.  It is beyond their comprehension that such a thing be regulated&hellip;..or that it needs to be regulated for their own protection.  Or even deeper&hellip;..that whites would care enough to do so.</p>
<p>The tragedy is, assuming the guy in this clip survived, he will be out doing the exact same thing in a few months (but with a limp) or something equally as bad.</p>

		<p>I agree the tickets for jaywalking were not in order. Instead, the parents should have been ticketed for ten grand or whatever the annual cost educating these gifted kids is. These parents send morons to school who don&rsquo;t know simple arithmetic, American history and will tell you they want to be doctors and lawyers but can&rsquo;t read, and they won&rsquo;t read even in grade 12.</p>
<p>Free education in America needs to become tuition-dependent, and entrance exams, real tough Asian style exams, for each grade,need to be implemented,ASAP. That&rsquo;s education reform we need. By the way, some white students will fall by the wayside and that&rsquo;s fine too. We can&rsquo;t accept the party atmosphere that educators embrace as &#8220;cross-cultural&#8221; learning.teachers </p>
<p>The Obama, Big Media, school reform movement, would fire because test scores of the millions of perpetual student so-called,morons, mostly but not entirely nonEuropean in origin, are unacceptable to the diversity mafia. The problem is the students,not most of the teachers. Universal education is a bad idea. Real Conservatives do not believe in equality, and proudly say so.</p>
<p>How many Republicans though agree with me, eh Glenn Beck, Hannity and President W Bush?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for a new Constitution. All men/women are not created equal.</p>

		<p>Type &#8220;Guy dances into traffic, gets hit by ice cream truck&#8221; in a search engine and you will find a youtube video of a black man dancing into traffic then getting hit by an ice cream truck.</p>
<p>Black irresponsibility is a major theme in black life.  Here we have black people asking the police to ignore the law on jaywalking because this is something black people love to do (they&rsquo;ll say they are targeted by the police, once again to take responsibility off of themselves).  Jaywalking is a little passive aggressive thing black people do to get back at white people and show zero respect for the law or organization.  If the police do stop enforcing the jaywalking law you will have scenes like the one that killed Deiron Albert.  Remember last year these black kids running wild in the streets of Chicago starting fights with each other and wacking each other with 2x4 wood boards?  The other consequence of ignoring the jaywalking law would be it repelling any of the white people who live or travel near these schools.  In a few years the area will be run down but black people will not take responsibility for it instead they will say white people left and police don&rsquo;t come around when there are problems.  The worst thing that can happen to white people is the lowering of our morale.  Non-white people know that if you push long enough white people will eventually give in.  Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago said the West would not fight for a prolonged period.  Black people are going to continue to push for exemption from responsibility whether it&rsquo;s jaywalking or robbery.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve almost been in a few accidents where black children are insouciantly playing ball games and other games in the street.  And I&rsquo;m not talking about side streets where traffic is light, I&rsquo;m talking about relatively high traffic two-lane avenues.  It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re oblivious to the world.  Or, more accurately, they&rsquo;re giving the world the finger.</p>
<p>You said:</p>
<p><i>The tragedy is, assuming the guy in this clip survived, he will be out doing the exact same thing in a few months (but with a limp) or something equally as bad.</i></p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;ll sue.  And that&rsquo;s what I think it&rsquo;s all about, on his part, and in what I just described   &mdash;   This man, or in the case of the children, their parents, are playing the ghetto lottery.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I don&rsquo;t think I would have needed any such warning.  My first hint would have been big dark-colored letters along the sides of the car that read &#8220;POLICE.&#8221;  Within 0.001 second, I would have deduced that enforcement of the law would soon happen.</p>

		<p>Here in Waterbury CT, the blacks love walking out into traffic without looking and taking as long as possible to shuck and jive across the street. I&rsquo;ve even seen several occasions where a mother will just step out into the street without a glance while leading with a baby carriage. </p>
<p>My favorite tactic is to slip the car into neutral and floor the gas pedal. Let me tell you, that works EVERY time. They really start moving then&hellip; During snow storms I have to come up a difficult hill to get home, so usually my strategy is to just start blowing my horn as soon as I see someone even THINKING about stepping into traffic in front of me. The message is clear: I ain&rsquo;t stopping, so you better get out of the way of my machine&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t say that the NAACP doesn&rsquo;t represent blacks. Here&rsquo;s an organization clearly composed of morons acting on impulse without any rational thought process or reasoning ability. </p>
<p>Even the name is absurd - if a white person referenced the organization by its full name and not by the initials he or she would be vilified for saying &#8220;colored people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP/blacks must be living in some parallel universe. It makes you wonder if it&rsquo;s really worth the effort to try and educate blacks.</p>
<p>The article stated, &#8220;The NAACP alleged that jaywalking tickets handed out to parents near Kermit R. Booker Sr. Empowerment Elementary School unfairly penalized people who live in a low-income area.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is so twisted it is nausea-inducing.  Low-income people (read: blacks) who break the law shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay fines because the fines cost too much. Well, in part, that&rsquo;s the idea behind fines. Perhaps next time you won&rsquo;t jaywalk and put your children at risk. </p>
<p>In this case, the object of the enforcement, of the fine, is to make sure the people follow the rules - often for their own good. But the NAACP is not paying any attention to the primary  point - they are only focused on the money and the fact that blacks were fined. </p>
<p>The knee-jerk response is to claim racism and stop there, then plead poverty so blacks don&rsquo;t have to pay, then blame the white man for the poverty. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the kids remain exposed to role models (I use the term loosely) who indicate to the kids that it is okay to jaywalk and not listen to any rules they don&rsquo;t like. This only increases the odds that the kids will get plowed into by a car at some point in the future.</p>
<p>With blacks, and by extension the NAACP, there is no ability to go beyond the superficial and ask &#8220;why&#8221; the fines are being given and what this actually means.</p>
<p>The article also notes, &#8220;NAACP officials, who are demanding the tickets be dismissed, said in a statement that &#8216;the actions of Metro officers have tainted the memory of this day for many parents and children at Booker&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does that have to do with anything?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that the NAACP &#8220;demanded&#8221; the tickets be dismissed. They have no more right to demand anything than I do, or my teenage daughter, or the man in the moon. </p>
<p>The tainted memory excuse is a classic. It&rsquo;s like someone saying their conviction for shoplifting should be thrown out because it makes their kids feel bad when they think about it. Ironically, it shouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue here. From what I know most blacks never seem to be able to remember anything after they are arrested and asked what happened the night before. So there&rsquo;s no memory to be tainted.</p>
<p>Lastly, Kermit Booker Empowerment Elementary School (what a name!) is 3% white. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it. And you can go on the web and look up exactly what a Clark County &#8220;empowerment&#8221; school is.  </p>
<p>But be warned - your blood pressure will likely rise as you read the liberal multicultural babble and discover the inordinate amount of additional money wasted on this lamebrain educational scheme. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more difficult to find out exactly who this Kermit Booker was. It took a little searching because I was curious. All I&rsquo;ll say to the readers of AmRen is: Kermit is exactly as you picture him to be.</p>

		<p>During the Viet-Nam war, it was not unheard of for parents (or some such adult) to  actually PUSH a child in front of a U.S. driven vehicle (this happened to friend on his motorcycle with whom I was riding) and the military just handed over money in the Asian version of the ghetto lottery. The Asians don&rsquo;t do such to other Asians, they know they will lose and be dead or seriously wounded for their troubles.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s long been noted that ghetto dwellers scream about law-breaking until the cops start cracking down. <br>
Last night, I was watching MSNBC to see the liberals squirm over the latest devastating polls.  Ed Schultz, who informed his listeners that  &mdash;  lo and behold  &mdash;  murder was out of hand in the inner cities, had Jesse Jackson on.  The rev naturally blamed guns rather than the thugs firing them, but if authorities instituted large sweeps to confiscate them, riots would break out, and he and Sharpton would be on TV 24/7 to howl racism!  Somehow, I guess, whitey is supposed to magically keep firearms from being illegally purchased in the ghettos  &mdash;  or fired at other blacks  &mdash;  or whatever.</p>

		<p>I always wondered what it was with blacks and jaywalking.  I briefly lived in a black neighborhood after college and that was the very first thing I noticed.  People would just step right out in front of my car and shuffle across the street.  Luckily for them I am an alert, defensive driver.  It always struck me as such an odd way of being defiant - and that&rsquo;s what it is.  So you&rsquo;re being rebellious by jaywalking?  So?  If I hit you with my car you may think I should have stopped on time but that won&rsquo;t change the fact that I&rsquo;ll be fine and you&rsquo;ll probably be dead.  I grew up in a liberal house and went to a liberal college and so I had no problem living in that neighborhood.  Seeing the constant jaywalking was the first time I remember really being convinced that blacks were just not that bright and maybe even a little mentally ill.  Stepping in out in front of traffic without looking is a CRAZY thing to do.  </p>

<p>This is so true. In NYC, during rush hour with people scurrying all around, you always see some black youths or black people in general just making a bad situation worse-sitting on a stairway in which people need to egress, blocking aisles, etc&hellip;I guess either they have no job to get too or their affirmative action Civil Service employer doesn&rsquo;t axe too much of them being on time.<br>

		<p>#12: It&rsquo;s not just blacks. While I was driving through Hartford in a VERY Puerto Rican neighborhood, a hispanic male shuffled out in front of me in the street. I didn&rsquo;t slow down (nearly hitting him) and he threw a plastic bottle at my vehicle. I did a u-turn and drove along the sidewalk for about 20 yards right at him; after that, I turned down a side street and came up behind a police cruiser at the light with another police cruiser pursuing me. The PR who&rsquo;d thrown the bottle came running up  &mdash;  &#8220;That&rsquo;s him, he tried to run me down! I have a whole block of witnesses!&#8221; I thought I was screwed (had a registered Glock hidden on the seat next to me) but all the cop did was ask for my driver&rsquo;s license &amp; registration. Then he let me go with a &#8220;Stay out of this neighborhood for the rest of the day.&#8221; As I drove off, I could still hear the cops bitching at the guy for hitting my car with the plastic bottle.  </p>
