<h1>LA Police Quell 2nd Protest Over Fatal Shooting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Raquel Maria Dillon, Google News, September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Demonstrators pelted police for a second night in a poor immigrant neighborhood following the fatal shooting of a Guatemalan day laborer who allegedly threatened people with a knife and then turned the weapon on a responding officer.</p>
<p>Officers fired at least two rounds of foam projectiles at demonstrators Tuesday night and 22 people were arrested, mainly for failure to disperse and unlawful assembly, Officer Karen Rayner said.</p>
<p>The disturbance erupted despite police Chief Charlie Beck&rsquo;s pledge to conduct a full investigation into the Sunday afternoon shooting of Manuel Jamines, 37, in the Westlake district near MacArthur Park, a neighborhood packed with recent immigrants from Central America.</p>
<p>An estimated 300 protesters who gathered outside the local police station hurled eggs, rocks and bottles and set a trash bin on fire. Others dropped household items from apartment buildings.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were throwing televisions, air conditioning units, miscellaneous furniture and other objects from the windows,&#8221; Lt. Cory Palka said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Monday night&rsquo;s violence, three officers were slightly injured by thrown objects and four people were arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor inciting a riot, Officer Bruce Borihanh said. Police said most of Monday&rsquo;s trouble involved a group handing out revolutionary fliers.</p>
<p>In the wake of the protests, authorities scheduled a community meeting for Wednesday evening at a school.</p>
<p>Beck said the Jamines shooting occurred after someone flagged down three bicycle officers to tell them a man was threatening people with a knife.</p>
<p>The officers approached the suspect and told him in Spanish and English to put down the weapon. Instead, Jamines raised the knife above his head and lunged at Officer Frank Hernandez, a 13-year veteran of the department, Beck said.</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts from six civilians, nine police personnel and two fire department staff indicate Hernandez fired twice &#8220;in immediate defense of life,&#8221; Beck said. Jamines died at the scene.</p>
<p>Investigators recovered a bloody, 6-inch knife at the scene but didn&rsquo;t know where the blood came from.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jamines was drunk but not dangerous, his cousin and neighbors said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beck said the officer involved in the shooting didn&rsquo;t have a baton or stun gun. He said bicycle officers frequently do not carry the selection of non-lethal weapons found in patrol cars.</p>
<p>Juana Neri, 57, a Mexican immigrant housewife who lives nearby, pushed her grocery bag in a baby stroller past the corner where Jamines was killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s bad, what the police did, but what&rsquo;s worse is the silly stuff that people were doing here,&#8221; she said, referring to Monday&rsquo;s violence. &#8220;We are not in our country, and with the problems that Hispanic immigrants have these days, it&rsquo;s better not to cause problems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ya think? It is odd that this guy&rsquo;s friends say he was not violent when he was running around drunk and brandishing knives! I guess these immigrants have a different definition of violence. </p>
<p>I have travelled overseas to Southeast Asia and I made sure I did not get plastered and start swinging a machete while visiting and I&rsquo;m sure the local cops would have filled me full of lead if the natives did&rsquo;nt take it upon themselves to hack me to death first. </p>
<p>Our attitude toward our foreign invaders must mystify the rest of the world. Criminal illegals protest and riot when one of their own is justifiably shot while attacking a police officer. If a group of expat Americans were to act the same way in Thailand or the Philippines the foreigners would be dealth with without mercy. </p>

<p><br>
Interesting.  Rather than provide legitimate police protection to the community (2 police to a car, 2 cars at every altercation working in teams), they have some guy in tights.  At least he is carrying a gun.  What he is not carrying (because he isn&rsquo;t a real police unit&hellip;.only a cheap substitute) is the correct equipment to safely handle a situation like this.  Result&hellip;.he had to choose between killing this guy or risking his own death.  Like any sane person, he chose his own safety.</p>
<p>The real story here is the reaction of the neighborhood.  Make no mistake, incidents where a whole community reacts like this is a prelude to race war and ethnic cleansing.  They do not see themselves as part of the US and it does not matter the criminality of the person involved.  What matters is his race.  And what they want is removal of authority not of their race from what they see as &#8220;their&#8221; land.  The individual incident is just an excuse to push this agenda.  A focus for something already there.</p>
<p>The reason I point out the bicycle unit thing is this is exactly what is happening.  The amount of money spent on policing has obviously been severely reduced if they are using pretend cops instead of correct staffing and equipping of real police.  This is one step above simply dissolving the police department and allowing the community to be their own law (no matter what words are written on worthless paper that represents &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s laws&#8221;).</p>
<p>These are de facto racial ethno-states.  Not tomorrow but here today.  Uncomfortably close to severing their ties with the state and federal governments.</p>

		<p>No riot needed in Atlanta. Blacks actually want criminals in their communities- seems normal- would be lonely without them- no snitching allowed.</p>
<p>But if only White Humanity would show such racial solidarity, we wouldn&rsquo;t suffer with the Equality Mandates.</p>
<p>Massive Resistance would never have collapsed, but would have actually worked- our &#8220;segregationist&#8221; politicians wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten away with selling us out to the blacks and their unmentionable elite supporters-</p>
<p><br>
https://tinyurl.com/2ael43o</p>
<p>When will the TV show interviews with these blacks? Oh, sorry, never will, because MSM doesn&rsquo;t want to broadcast anything that will &#8220;reflect poorly on the community,&#8221; such as anything any of these blacks might say that exposes the Liberal Lie about our need to reach out and do more for those whom we have oppressed and marginalized, the &#8220;other&#8221;, the &#8220;least of these&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unless you pledge upon the name of Rosa Parks and MLK to &#8220;foster diversity and help minorities by atoning for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges,&#8221; and unless you force your White daughters to take an oath that &#8220;making White babies is a hate crime against human dignity,&#8221; then you are unfit for decent society because there is no place for people like you who are the Voice of Hatred, Exclusion, and Intolerance.  We&rsquo;ll get you fired, you raciss %#&K;!</p>
<p>Dang, at least show us who dey be who be kepp&rsquo;n it real!<br>

<p>How smart.  &#8220;Quick, Jose, throw our T.V. out the window so we can get back at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>If they wanted change why didn&rsquo;t they pass out flyers in their own countries instead of coming here to do that?  The answer is obvious:  They know full well the police there wouldn&rsquo;t put up with it and would crack heads and drag them off to one of their rat infested prisons.</p>
<p>True justice is when these parasites and ingrates are forced to go back to their countries of origin, because they can&rsquo;t get any jobs or social benefits here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting close to such a situation right now.<br>

<p>Welcome to a distinctly &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; foreshadowing of the future: The Utopian States of  America!</p>
<p>An officer named Frank Hernandez slaughters an &ldquo;undocumented migrant&rdquo; of Guatemalan extraction and bloodthirsty intent, and a riot ensues. Laughably, this would indicate to me that &ldquo;Officer Frank Hernandez, a 13-year veteran of the department,&rdquo; is now nominally white and an oppressor. </p>
<p>Just as I would expected and so you should have too; if they do not have whites to demonize and displace, they will invent them. Why do I see that Orwellian boot, endlessly stomping on a human face forever into the future?</p>

		<p>Can you imagine what would have happened to these immigrants back in their respective countries when they began throwing things out of windows at the police?  There would have been a massacre. Our police are the only ones who are obliged to negotiate with rioters while being assaulted with various and sundry missles.</p>

<p>Off topic rant here. I grew up with an Irish Setter on each end of the fireplace but&hellip;.I`m getting really skittish about dog walkers who let their pets off the leash only to have  them snarl at me three feet away with teeth bared. &#8220;He won`t bite!&#8221;, they say. &#8220;Yeah? Why`s he giving me a different message?&#8221; I ask. It`s like they LET their pets assault me and do nothing. Maybe that`s their message to  a stranger walking by. Frankly I`m more worried about being bitten anymore than being robbed. And I am prepared to act accordingly (for now) after I get bit.  And before the second time. If I ever do.</p>

		<p>Mr. Jimines was drunk? A shocker for sure. Can&rsquo;t we just drop plastic gallon jugs of cheap gin and whiskey over these immigant communities, block off the outgoing roads, and let them each have a few gallons a night. Certainly would reduce the &#8220;immigrant&#8221; population to but a few. You&rsquo;d also be surprised how fast the illegal high school population would decrease! </p>
<p>Or simply use the tactics their own Guatamalan police use against Mobs, Commies, renegade priests and malcontents. Freefall lessons from a helicopter. </p>
<p>And they are protesting the mild LAPD response?  </p>

		<p>Incidents like these should be celebrated here, as they are basically just free propaganda for our cause! All sensible people can see what transpired here and few but the &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; will find fault with the police officer&rsquo;s actions.<br>
The savage reaction of the local Hispanics - just as it is with blacks - shows everyone that these people are not like us - they are not compatible with White, fully civilized societies.</p>
<p>Getting blitzed and wielding knives at police may be accpetable behavior is Guatamala&hellip;but not here! Of course we know the Guatamalan police would probabaly have shot this idiot right off the bat, but that is another story. </p>

		<p>Tim Mc Hugh wrote about asinine dog owners (by the millions) these days, who never leash their dogs. Said dogs frequently growl at, jump up on, snap at, and tear into innocent passers by, on the sidewalks, in yards, and on trails.<br>
I have had a blue healer snap at my face, and a pit bull come with in inches of me, snarling.</p>
<p>I have resolved to carry a powerful taser to zap any dog that gets too close, unless it is wagging it&rsquo;s tail and smiling.</p>
<p> I like dogs, but I think something very critical has broken down among a large percentage of dog owners- often white libtards&hellip;they believe their beloved :family member&#8221; has more rights than you or I, and they believe they above all should be free&hellip;to let their dog dump all over the trails, to let their dog roam free, inconveniencing everyone. When their beloved pooch is writhing on the ground and screaming due to a nasty shock after menacing a law abiding passer- by, the libtards will get a jolt of reality.</p>
<p>The problem (assuming they have cajones) is that the libtards may go nuts, and need to get tased themselves. How can you win? You try NOT to get bitten to pieces, the dog owner is breaking the leash law, you defend yourself, the owner attacks you, and you zap them, then they&rsquo;re pressing charges. I can see it now. But This nonsense of &#8220;oh, he doesn&rsquo;t bite&#8221; is not flying anymore. When that damned blue healer took a snap at my face in mid-air, I yelled at the libtard who the dog apparently owned. Her reply? without even slowing down, she said, in sarcastic tones, Sorry, gee, have a nice day!</p>
<p>Idiots like that have no business owning a dog.</p>

		<p>The John and Ken show on KFI 640 talked about this for a lot of the day.  They described the neighborhood as &#8220;ceded&#8221; land.  They also reported that much of the chaos was being caused by communists who do not live there, but swooped in to stir the pot.  There was no reporting on the ethnic make up of the communists, but given the neighborhood is among the most dangerous in LA, I doubt it was anglo trustafarians.  </p>

		<p>If the officer had a taser available he might have used it instead of his gun.  Unfortunately some liberal communities, and I suspect LA fits the bill perfectly, are opposed to tasers despite the number of lives saved because a number of people have indeed died from tasers. The opponents of these police tools are just as short sighted about tasers as they are illegal immigration. For a change the two equally shortsighted viewpoints worked out alright together.</p>

		<p>So a latino police officer (probably of mexican ancestry) shot a latino drunk waving a knife - and latinos riot!</p>
<p>Amazing!  Amazing!</p>
<p>It is so cool that no one could shout racism and white oppression.  So when latinos try to control other latinos, it&rsquo;s just &#8216;opresion&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when black cops kill black suspects, Al Sharpton can&rsquo;t say racism, he just cries: Police brutality.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The amount of money spent on policing has obviously been severely reduced if they are using pretend cops instead of correct staffing and equipping of real police&#8221;.</p>
<p>He seems a lot less a pretend-cop today&hellip;</p>
<p>Wonder if many of these &#8216;protesters&rsquo; are anarchists who car-pooled to the location. That&rsquo;s not so much effort for a &#8216;good cause&rsquo;. Why are these immigrants here if they need a protest and a riot to feel that &#8216;something is being done&rsquo; so they wont have to go-off on their own most likely or beat their wifes or whatever it is they do. Obviously something is wrong with them in the first place. Or at least they belong somewhere else. </p>

		<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s bad, what the police did, but what&rsquo;s worse is the silly stuff that people were doing here,&rdquo; she said, referring to Monday&rsquo;s violence. &ldquo;We are not in our country, and with the problems that Hispanic immigrants have these days, it&rsquo;s better not to cause problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would say - in all seriousness - that LA is their country. They are the majority and most of LA has  a Hispanic culture (at least from what I have seen). The day of valley girls and blond surfers has come and gone.</p>
<p>But I would also say that certain parts of LA - like South Central - are now more civilized because Hispanics have chased out the blacks.<br>

<p>Exactly!  They (the police or military)  should have blocked off each end of the street (with a tank), gone down the street to each house, rounded everyone up, demanded to see their papers, and deported ALL without proper ID or proof of employement. No hearings, no lawyers, no endless appeals, nothing but a summary deportation on the spot. </p>
<p>And then follow this same prodedure, street after street.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s  <i>the only way </i> that&rsquo;s going to work. But it takes backbone   &mdash;   something which our politicos simply don&rsquo;t have. And of course, the clergy, academics, and press would be howling like banshees.</p>

		<p>He seems a lot less a pretend-cop today</p>
<p><br>
Would the issue have been more clear had he been shot and died because part of the heavy equipment he couldn&rsquo;t lug around on his bike is a bullet proof vest?  How many incidents like this happened in this neighborhood but didn&rsquo;t garner national attention like this incident did?</p>
<p>Look, the bike cop thing has some advantages over the beat cop and has its place in policing (that place being nudging drunken teens off a boardwalk after the sun sets)  But obviously, in this high risk neighborhood, it&rsquo;s not appropriate.  Rioting like this is not spontaneous.  It takes years of increasingly violent and bizarre behavior before a community degenerates to this.  A nice, normal, quiet neighborhood (the type that should be patrolled by say, bike cops) doesn&rsquo;t just turn into this one day.  It&rsquo;s been a hell hole for a long time&hellip;..obviously.</p>
<p>This is a place where cops should be working in heavily armed teams in unmarked cars.  If you&rsquo;ve ever witnessed a special gang unit at work in a ghetto neighborhood, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Instead, it was a lightly equipped, lone guy on a bike.  That is one step above no cop at all.  And it could just as easily have resulted in a dead cop as a dead psycho.  Or, in this instance, a cop killed by the obviously messed up people living in this neighborhood, immediately after the incident.</p>
<p>That cop is for SHOW.  Not a legitimate attempt at policing.</p>

		<p>I live in Los Angeles.  It is not a riot at all.  It is a group of about 50 activists who run around every night setting fires in trash cans.   One thing many people admired about hispanics.  They never did what the blacks do, riot and demonstarte every time one of their thugs are arrested.  Think of hispanic serial killers like Juan Corona, Richard Ramirez and all the gangsters.  No hispanic riots.</p>
<p>But these criminals have learned from the blacks and SPLC ACLU ADL Whites.  They are doing their best to start something but 50 thugs can&rsquo;t do much, especially as most of them have outstanding felony warrants and parole violations and can be held in jail for a while after being arrested.</p>

		<p>To Stimpy 6, regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, does that count as a promotion? I&rsquo;m sure he would have preferred sergeant&rsquo;s stripes and a pay raise.</p>
<p>God help us, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An excellent observation Stimpy 6!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, the more &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; and &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; people and feeders that flood into this country, the harder it will be to distinguish racial demarcations. In general, as this country sinks toward under 50% white European in composition, high achieving middle class Hispanics and Asians will find themselves increasingly associated with the white middle class plurality, simply so that there is a majority &ldquo;tax-base&rdquo; to use and abuse from both above and below. This is multiculturalism at its finest, as it allows race to be slowly submerged into the poll of class warfare and dilute its genetic importance. This does not mean that the overwhelmingly white majority middle class USA of the 1700s to roughly the early 1960s is going to be mirrored directly, but instead sort of distorted in a collective fun house fashion, from about 1967 to the present.</p>
<p>That may seem like madness and stupidity combined in a martini glass, but it is multiculturalism&rsquo;s only purpose for existing, just like its discredited grandparent, Marxism. Utopia must always be, a dystopia of class warfare endlessly dictated by the sanctimonious &ldquo;elites&rdquo; and mindlessly prosecuted by the worthless &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; against the productive and indispensable middle class, no matter how racially unbalanced.</p>
<p>Red politics and green eyes, the most striking chromatic features of the rainbow monster!</p>
<p>All the best to you Stimpy 6,</p>
<p>John PM!!!</p>

<p>About a month ago, my neighbor&rsquo;s two very elderly dogs tottered out of his backyard after the gardener left the gate open.

		<p>I heard Chief Beck&rsquo;s community forum and he sounded like a groveling wimp  &mdash;  shouted down by screaming hispanics and repeatedly called an assassin.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mayor Villaraigosa says the officers involved in that deadly shooting of a man holding a knife were heroes who -as he put it- &#8216;acted with bravery.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Mayor LaRaza was ordered to say this by his handlers because another large, punitive pay-out due to &#8216;police misconduct&rsquo; will break LA  &mdash;  and re-instate the consent decree.</p>
<p>The radical activists want as large a payout as the rioters received in the mayday melee ($12.85 million), rodney king (see article above), the huge rampart scandal lottery ($70 million), and firefighter tennie pierce, who ate two bites of dog food and &#8216;earned&rsquo; 2.7 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;LAPD Chief Charlie Beck says at least six witnesses have said the man had a knife and had threatened a pregnant woman and other people&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>None of that matters. &#8220;A woman now says she saw the deadly police shooting near MacArthur Park   &mdash;   and did not see a knife in the man&rsquo;s hand. She was offered up to reporters by an anti-police activist.&#8221;</p>
<p>This report trumps six witnesses and the police officers who repeatedly yelled &#8216;drop your weapon&rsquo; in English and Spanish.  </p>
<p>And, from the Browser:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; but the big difference is that here THEY KNOW THEY CAN..There will be community meetings, outreach programs, more funding, sympathetic politicians, and sob stories in the press&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is problem #1.  They&rsquo;re only doing what the government allows them to do.  </p>
<p>There will be a payout to the &#8216;victim&rsquo;s&rsquo; family to placate the activists.  Count on it.</p>
<p>And from Anon #34:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;They are doing their best to start something but 50 thugs can&rsquo;t do much, especially as most of them have outstanding felony warrants and parole violations and can be held in jail for a while after being arrested&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t matter when their entitlements are cut off.  There will be rioting, lots of it, and it will be violent and brutal.  And it will be directed at those they&rsquo;ve been told by the government and media oppressed them and stole their land.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s YOU, White Kulak, not the police.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an old Marx Brothers line that comes to mind:</p>
<p>#1.  &#8220;Doctor, doctor; it hurts when I do this.&#8221;<br>
#2.  &#8220;Then don&rsquo;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s simply &#8220;suicide by cop&#8221;.  Assaulting a cop with a deadly weapon will get you shot; it&rsquo;s just that simple.  Don&rsquo;t want to get shot by cops?  Don&rsquo;t give them a reason to do it, even if you&rsquo;re a Guatemalan illegal alien who&rsquo;s so drunk you think you&rsquo;re ten feet tall and bulletproof.  As others have intimated, the real problem here is not that a societally worthless individual earned himself a Darwin Award, but that others feel compelled to make a cause celebre out of the incident.  What these &#8220;valuable members of a hard-working immigrant community (blah, blah, blah)&#8221; are saying is that the nobody should not be allowed to defend themselves against attempted murder by drunks or druggies, provided said drunks and druggies are of the politically-correct racial/ethnic minority.</p>
