<h1>Hispanics Now Largest Group in Escondido</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>J. Harry Jones and Morgan Lee, San Diego Union-Tribune, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South County has long had cities where Hispanics make up the largest part of the population. Now for the first time, the trend has extended into North County  &mdash;  and demographers expect more of that growth in years to come, perhaps changing the makeup of city councils, boosting the ethnic mix of schools and increasing tensions over illegal immigration and public services.</p>
<p>Hispanics account for 46 percent of Escondido&rsquo;s population, according to the latest estimates from the San Diego Association of Governments. The second-largest group, non-Hispanic whites, comes in at 44 percent.</p>
<p>Another North County municipality, Vista, shows a tie  &mdash;  at 44 percent  &mdash;  for Hispanic and non-Hispanic white residents.</p>
<p>Escondido and Vista join three South Bay cities that have significant Hispanic populations: National City (63 percent), Chula Vista (51 percent) and Imperial Beach (48 percent).</p>
<p>The statistics do not differentiate between legal and illegal residents. {snip}</p>
<p>Patrick Osio of Chula Vista, who edits a newsletter on Hispanic affairs, said the dynamics are ripe for a political transformation once more Hispanics  &mdash;  such as the young and recent immigrants  &mdash;  join the voting ranks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sam Abed, a councilman from the same city, said the problem isn&rsquo;t having many Hispanics, just that they don&rsquo;t try to assimilate into the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In National City, where Hispanics have been in the majority during the past decade, Mayor Ron Morrison said ethnic diversity has translated into different priorities for the city, including greater demand for everything from soccer facilities to affordable housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also a low-income community. That&rsquo;s going to happen when there are a lot of people where English isn&rsquo;t their first language,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re having to work on housing and everything else for people with low incomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Imperial Beach, within view of the U.S.-Mexico border, the Hispanic population inched ahead of the non-Hispanic white population in 2002 and now accounts for nearly half of the residents there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, non-Hispanic whites are still by far the majority population in large portions of the North Coast and East County. Examples are Del Mar (85 percent white), Santee (77 percent), Carlsbad (76 percent), Encinitas and Coronado (74 percent), Solana Beach (73 percent), Poway (71 percent) and La Mesa (67 percent).</p>
<p>The largest ethnic and racial groups in the city of San Diego are non-Hispanic whites (44 percent), Hispanics (28 percent), Asians (16 percent) and blacks (7 percent).</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sam Abed, a councilman from the same city [Escondito], said the problem isn&rsquo;t having many Hispanics, just that they don&rsquo;t try to assimilate into the community.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Some observations on predominantly low-skilled Hispanic immigration   &mdash;  - legal and illegal   &mdash;  - which has been the immigration policy of the United States since 1965:</p>
<p>Heather Mac Donald is a John M. Olin fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;If someone proposed a program to boost the number of Americans who lack a high school diploma, have children out of wedlock, sell drugs or use welfare, he&rsquo;d be deemed mad.  Yet our current immigration chaos is doing just that.  Hispanics have the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country.  Nearly 50 percent of Hispanic children are born out of wedlock, a rate twice that of whites and three times that of Asians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hispanic drop-out rate is the highest in the country and Hispanic children are joining gangs at earlier and earlier ages &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, many Hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them, but too many of their children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values.  The incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans jumps eight-fold &hellip; between the 1st and 2nd generations, to a rate three and a half times that of whites &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Many of the costs imposed by Mexican and Central American immigrants are a function of their lack of education and their own and their children&rsquo;s behavior, not their legal immigration status.  Immigration reform that simply legalizes the present immigration mix is certain to expand the underclass, despite the admirable work ethic that the first generation of Latinos usually brings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, those statistics SHOULD differentiate! <br>
 <br>
And those &#8220;young and recent <i>immigrants</i>&#8221;, if they&rsquo;re illegal or the children of illegals, should NOT be voting at all!!!</p>
<p>The handwriting is on the wall.  It&rsquo;s up to us to read it. <br>
We&rsquo;re fools if we don&rsquo;t, and we&rsquo;ll deserve what we get.</p>

		<p>All this talk of &#8220;assimilating&#8221; nonwhites is getting old!  They can never be assimilated into a White society or nation! They should never be encouraged to do so! I don&rsquo;t want them in this nation to begin with and &#8220;assimilation&#8221; was for White nationalities from the Euro nations ONLY! Our Founding Fathers KNEW this, so why has this truth been suppressed over the years?</p>
<p> Ever hear any of these so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; mouthpieces or Christian pastors tell this truth? The TP&rsquo;ers most assuredly never will. All these &#8220;movements&#8221; are just a ploy to lull the sheep into accepting even more &#8220;racial diversity&#8221; so as not to be &#8220;racist&#8221;. White people, for the most part, have to be the most stupid and gullible race on the planet.</p>

		<p>I am SO glad I got my dad out of that area, and sold his house (for a loss, but still a lot, when compared to the rest of the nation) last year, before he died. </p>
<p>We used to laugh in North County, when we spoke of areas we were glad we didn&rsquo;t have to live in; and called Chula Vista, &#8216;Chula-juana&rsquo; tipping our hat to the other &#8216;juana&rsquo; in the area (Tijuana). Driving around my old stomping grounds a year ago, while dad&rsquo;s house was being readied to transfer title (it was sold to a family of Philipinos- non-whites who could barely speak English) I reminisced about how beautiful, how WHITE it was, when we moved there in the 1970&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What this article does not mention is that the areas with the highest concentrations of Whites, are also the areas where (even in Californication) home prices START at like 700,000. for a 1500 sq.foot shack. Del Mar has the highest concentration of million dollar plus homes per square mile I know of, save maybe Carmel.</p>
<p>Escondido has another name too, ever since the Hispanicization of the town gained momentum. Just add an &#8216;l&rsquo; to the name, and you&rsquo;ll know how Whites who either moved there, retired there, or have been transferred there, feel about the loss of quality of  life, the sullen stares, the loud and obnoxious behavior of their &#8216;neighbors&rsquo;. And then wonder why ANYONE who is an American would want the same thing in Wisconsin, Virginia, or Oregon.</p>
