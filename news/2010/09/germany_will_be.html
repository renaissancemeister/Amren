<h1>Germany Will Become Islamic State, Says Chancellor Merkel</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Williams, Family Security Matters, September 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germans have failed to grasp how Muslim immigration has transformed their country and will have to come to terms with more mosques than churches throughout the countryside, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our country is going to carry on changing, and integration is also a task for the society taking up the task of dealing with immigrants,&#8221; Ms. Merkel told the daily newspaper. &#8220;For years we&rsquo;ve been deceiving ourselves about this. Mosques, for example, are going to be a more prominent part of our cities than they were before.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chancellor&rsquo;s remarks represent the first official acknowledgement that Germany, like other European countries, is destined to become a stronghold of Islam. She has admitted that the country will soon become a stronghold.</p>
<p>In France, 30% of children age 20 years and below are Muslims. The ratio in Paris and Marseille has soared to 45%. In southern France, there are more mosques than churches.</p>
<p>The situation within the United Kingdom is not much different. {snip} Presently, there are over 1000 mosques throughout Great Britain  &mdash;  - many of which were converted from churches.</p>
<p>In Belgium, 50% of the newborns are Muslims and reportedly its Islamic population hovers around 25%. A similar statistic holds true for The Netherlands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same story in Russia where one in five inhabitants is a Muslim.</p>

		<p>This seems to be grounds for her removal - impeachment, or whatever the German equivalent is.  &#8220;Our country is going to carry on changing&hellip;&#8221; - by whose will, and with what right?  Surely the German people do not want this, and should put a stop to politicians who encourage it.</p>

		<p>It just means that the West will die in a generation.<br>
All because of the cowardliness of it&rsquo;s leaders that<br>
are ruled by fear, and appeasement. If they take a<br>
stand with firmness, they would be forced to back <br>
down by the over whelming pressures coming from mostly<br>

<p>These same politicians who are ready to surrender native nationality are the same ones enacting legislation that gives corporations enhanced property rights protection across borders. </p>
<p>This is the new world order: free, unfettered movement of capital and people across borders, no rights for nations.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s shameful and disquieting that Angela Merkel seems to just shrug her shoulders and say, &#8220;The Muslims are going to overrun us, and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it; we might just as well reconcile ourselves to it.&#8221; The author of this piece seems to agree with her   &mdash;   and also to approve of the Muslim wave that is burying 1,000 years of European history and tradition.</p>
<p> In Germany in particular, this is the worst part of Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s legacy: Not &#8220;six million Jews&#8221;; not &#8220;World War II&#8221;; not &#8220;the most evil man in history,&#8221; as leftists never tire of referring to him. His actions and the history he left, have made Germans so paralyzed with White guilt, that they cannot bring themselves to defend their own country, culture and race. It&rsquo;s kind of like slavery in the U.S. In one case, &#8220;If you defend yourself, you&rsquo;re a Nazi.&#8221; In the other, &#8220;If you defend yourself, you&rsquo;re a racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like the rest of Europe, Germany is deteriorating economically to serious levels, which is going to cause inter-tribal fighting on a grand scale.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m VERY serious when I say this silly woman needs to keep her mouth shut and her eyes open, because she is missing the big picture.</p>
<p>Telling her fellow countrymen they are going to lose their country to radical religious fanatics who believe in beating and stoning women to death, honor killings and all the rest just might elicit a reaction she isn&rsquo;t expecting.</p>

		<p>The ironic contrast of Angela Merkel&rsquo;s deadpan delivery with that of the Marxist playwright Brecht who famously said that he expected the government not to bother with changing policy, because they could simply replace the population comes to mind.<br>
Doubly ironic because for years we heard of conservative commentators chuckling about the Communist demise and its &#8220;1984&#8221;-ish death rattles, yet here we have the captured population of a Euro-capitalist and quite rich Germany being metaphorically trained off.<br>
Funny how after so much struggle and blood the inheritance goes to the clods who happened to move in after it was all over.<br>

		<p>Well, they say that the German invasions of the Roman Empire later produced stronger states afterward.  Perhaps if the Europeans convert to Islam, they can shed their white guilt and become expansionist again.  Imagine that!</p>

		<p>whiteraven, that&rsquo;s not going to happen.  East Asians will move in.  The situation for white people will be like what it is for black people in America but much worse where white people will work for East Asian companies, buy East Asian products but produce nothing, have a few white people succeed, have white people used as entertainment and value ignorance and failure.  White people are getting sliced apart at the top by East and South Asians, at the bottom by blacks, Latinos and Southeast Asians and everything else by muslim adherents or just falling apart on it&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>Andrea Merkel like all white politicians won&rsquo;t close the border at least.  That would be &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Instead she&rsquo;ll leave the immigration policies basically the same or increase foreign immigration and let the lower classes of white people struggle with the consequences.  White people do not have people in power looking out for the interests of white people and preserving what white people created.</p>

<p>    This is very bad news that will have negative    implications<br>
    for Europe in terms of security and cultural/civilizational<br>

<p>    All one has to do is look at what type of damage Islam has <br>
    done in South-eastern Europe.  Examples Serbia, Kosovo,etc.<br>
    The damage is of a more deeper nature also.  The <br>
    comparative economic and cultural backwardness of SE<br>
    Europe is due to the Islamic rule and domination of the <br>
    region.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here, but when I see the devil, I won&rsquo;t run  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ll spit in his face, just to see if it sizzles while it drips down his cheek.  I do the same with islam.  Islam needs to be mocked, viciously, savagely, until it indeed submits.  The devil cannot stand to be mocked; hence, we need to mock him, as it exposes his weaknesses.  We need to mock all muslims in the most savage fashion to let them know that we are not going to put up with their atavistic violence any longer.</p>

		<p>I live near Paris. <br>
The exact figures are not known, because the French state doesn&rsquo;t make religious (nor ethnical) statistics, but there are estimates, and it is unbelievable that 20% of people under twenty years old are Muslims, and 45% in Paris (or in Paris + suburbs). It is ridiculous to say that in Southern France there are more mosques than churches. Maybe in some or many places there are more practising Muslims than Catholics, but there is a church in every village, and there are many villages&hellip;<br>
At least this part of the article is ridiculous.    </p>

		<p>No one sees the tongue in her cheek?  This is essentially a public call to arms.  She admits the Islamic invasion is coming to her country, and publicly states that they will soon be overrun.  I see it as a very clever political ploy.  Germany will always be White, several members of my family have moved back to the homeland because of the reports of homogeneity, and the orderly system.  Hell, *I* plan to retire there.  She is simply pointing out to her people that there is trouble on the horizon, hey folks, lets get moving on this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mosques, for example, are going to be a more prominent part of our cities than they were before.</p>

<p>She tipped her hand by using the word &#8220;prominent&#8221; rather than &#8220;common&#8221; or &#8220;ubiquitous&#8221;.   Prominent implies <i>prestigious and dominant</i>&hellip;which is exactly what the Muslims have in mind.  </p>

<p>Fortunately we have the means here in America to do just that   &mdash;   namely, the 2nd Amendment. IMHO the &#8220;awkward stage&#8221; that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Wolfe#Quote" rel="nofollow">Claire Wolfe</a> referred to is just about over.</p>
<p>Also IMHO that&rsquo;s the only reason the Muslims here are not running amok as they are in Europe, where the people have been disarmed (and thus rendered helpless) by their own governments. The only exception is Switzerland, and even they are now fed up with Muslim misconduct, as the recent moratorium on minarets will attest. Fortunately there are still plenty of Europeans willing to fight; they just need the weapons. If Switzerland can&rsquo;t provide enough, the US and Russia should smuggle them in. Recall what the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were able to accomplish once they were sufficiently armed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I find it beyond ironic that Germany   &mdash;   supposedly still trying to repudiate its Nazi past 65 years on   &mdash;   lets in the very same people who in 1945 offered Hitler political asylum.</p>

		<p>&gt; Greg, if you mean that Iceland is looking good because it is mostly white, think again. They are part of the E.U. and allow any and all European citizens to settle there. Like the rest of Europe, they have muslim and African rapists there now&hellip;.and extremely light prison sentences to boot. There is no sanctuary left.</p>
<p>Iceland is NOT part of the EU. <br>

<p>&#8220;Iceland is NOT part of the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps not now.  But&hellip; it is a candidate for membership and has applied.  Currently, Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union (EU). In July 2009 the Icelandic parliament voted in favour of application for EU membership.  Icelandic membership will probably occur by 2012.</p>
