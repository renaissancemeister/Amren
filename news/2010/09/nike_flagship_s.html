<h1>Nike Flagship Store Shut Down, Latest Store to Have Bedbugs Bite</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Georgett Roberts and Cathy Burke, New York Post, September 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nike&rsquo;s tourist-friendly flagship store here is closed down because of bedbugs, the Just Do It corporate giant said today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s one of our most popular stores,&#8221; said Nike spokesman Kijuan Wilkins.</p>
<p>In a statement, Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike  &mdash;  which became synonymous with ex-NBA superstar Michael Jordan when he was its celebrity spokesman  &mdash;  the company said it had &#8220;proactively closed Niketown&#8221; when bedbugs were discovered there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nike is the latest big retailer in Manhattan to get bit by the bedbug infestation.</p>
<p>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also was shut down the bed bug infestation that is ravaging New York, as well as one Times Square theater.<br>

		<p>Why, from reading this and similar stories, one would think that the bedbugs just appeared out of nowhere, like one of the biblical plagues.  Not a single word about where they might have come from.  Isn&rsquo;t that odd?<br>

		<p>I find it vaguely amusing that large corporations that usually don&rsquo;t hesitate to break laws in other ways, let a situation like this develop.</p>
<p>Simply hire a handful of trusted goons, to enter the store at night, and illegally spread DDT liberally about.  This would instantly (and permanently) kill any bedbug infestation for very little money and no questions asked.</p>
<p>Which practically begs the question, why didn&rsquo;t they do it?  There are many possible answers&hellip;..none of which involve a respect for the environment or the law.</p>

While I agree with the vast majority of views espoused by AR, I have to say I find blaming the re-emergence of diseases and infestations on immigrants to be the least convincing in regards to controlling illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Certainly physical screening of immigrants as happened in previous generations would be a good thing. However, I don&rsquo;t believe the problem is necessarily illegal immigrants so much as it is associated more with the ease of inexpensive and frequent travel.</p>

<p><br>
That is true. But legal or illegal should not even be the issue here.  We know what parts of the world these problems are coming from. We know what people are bringing them.</p>

		<p>Sorry sbuffalonative, it&rsquo;s directly linked to immigration - both legal and illegal.  The ease or mode of transport has nothing to do with it.  The carrier is the immigrant and his possessions, not the Rider truck, pickup, or whatever he got here on.  And it isn&rsquo;t just from Mexicans or hispanics.  We get lots of lovely third world diseases and infestations from Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere also.  Things eradicated that are now back: polio, TB, bed bugs, syphilis, dengue fever, etc etc.  All imported from the third world through our immigration policies of ignoring illegal invasion, and possessing a clear PREFERENCE for colored immigrants while making it near impossible for a White to immigrate.  Simple reason for the preference?  Lower IQ&rsquo;s, already used to corruption in government, already tolerant of dictators, and ALL rightly assumed to be votes for Democrats once naturalized, or as often allowed to vote with little or no scrutiny before legally able to do so.  The diseases are a side issue.  The destruction of our country and our way of life is the issue.</p>

		<p>@sbuffalonative No one said that illegal immigrants are causing the bed bug plague. You must wonder though which &#8220;frequent travelers&#8221; to which far flung places are bringing back these parasites.</p>

		<p>The problem with the DDT plan mentioned above is that the substance is not readily available; the only countries that still make it are India, China and North Korea.  Current bedbug populations are highly resistant to most pesticides, including the old DDT.</p>
<p>One way to get rid of them is to seal a building and then saturate the inside with CO2.   </p>

		<p>Regardless of where they are coming from, there are only two solutions to this infestation and both begin _at_ the border (container ship unloading facility, whatever&hellip;).</p>
<p>Genetics.  Develop and maintain stocks of big, mean, sexually dominant, bed bugs.  Whose eggs and sperm are either toxic or sterile, to other bedbugs.  Sterile breeders = 1-generation genocides.  Making people taste bad might also work but I frankly don&rsquo;t trust Big Pharma as vaccine or repellant companies.</p>
<p>Nannites.  Which act like mobile diotomaceous earth, getting inside the bugs and sand-in-crotch abrading their tissues against their own exoskeletons, ripping them apart internally.  Theoretically, this could also be done biologically with bacterial rotgut but I like mechanical solutions because they are less likely to mutate.</p>
<p>The old tricks of boric acid, plastic encapsulation, ovens and steam cleaning _will not work_ if the bugs achieve widespread dissemination, as from a retail location.  And the economy could end up losing billions with a B dumping contaminated consumer goods and sterilizing infested mass-housing and the like.</p>
<p>Throw in a newly bug-compatible disease like the plague which halved 1300s Europe and you could have biblical level destruction in our over crowded living conditions.</p>

		<p>I just had a thought tonight about the bedbug problem. I think it&rsquo;s not just the immigrants landing on out shores, it&rsquo;s also all the stuff coming in from China, etc. Almost everything we buy now comes from a third world country.  </p>

		<p>It has everything to do with immigration.  The return of TB in the US is extreme cause for concern, and it is very obvious from whence it has come. When immigration was really controlled, people had to pass a medical exam.  Though it was not as comprehensive as one would wish, it did help in controlling the influx of diseases from other countries.  Now an infected individual need but hop the fence and he/she is now in the US along with the illness.</p>
<p>Also, look at all the food recalls just in the last year or so.  I also believe that these problems are linked to our absurd immigration policies and the employment of &#8220;undocumented&#8221; workers whose hygiene practices are less than acceptable.</p>

<p>Immigration, foreign students, tourism too.  People are coming here from everywhere. But now especially from the Third World. Suddenly, China and India have now the money (which used to be ours   &mdash;   but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to give medical exams to these people (and would you inspect tourists too?),  but it would be necessary to irradiate their luggage and possessions.   (I&rsquo;m all for it, btw., but the airlines and the huge travel industry would never stand for it.  Have you ever been to Las Vegas and seen all the foreigners there???)</p>

<p>Here in Toronto we&rsquo;re also having a bedbug scare. Local news story about two weeks ago about how large downtown cinema had to purge itself of bedbugs just days before the Toronto Int&rsquo;l Film Festival was to begin. Apparently the problem was brought under control in time   &mdash;   otherwise visiting dignitaries from Hollywood and around the world might take &#8220;Canadian&#8221; bedbugs back with them as souvenirs when they return home after the festival!</p>
<p>Needless to say, Toronto&rsquo;s media are just as reluctant as New York&rsquo;s to bring up the question of WHERE these foul creatures came from, or HOW they got into our white Western cities   &mdash;   because the bedbug problem is CLEARLY due to Third World immigrants. The only question is WHICH ONES?</p>
