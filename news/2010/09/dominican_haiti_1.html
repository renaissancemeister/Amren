<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2063078&amp;nid=836">Dominican, Haitian Killed in Race-Fueled Dispute</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ezequiel Abiu Lopez, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), September 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Dominican foreman fatally shot a Haitian worker during an argument over pay, touching off racial clashes Sunday at a construction site that killed a Dominican worker and injured another, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a police statement, Haitians working on the residential project were demanding unpaid wages Saturday when the foreman, whose identity was not released, drew a pistol and fired, killing 32-year-old Issac Louis.</p>
<p>The next day, Haitian workers attacked their Dominican supervisors with rocks and wooden poles, beating 34-year-old Maximiliano Hierro to death and wounding 36-year-old William Leonel de la Cruz, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Construction, agriculture and other industries in the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic depend on the labor of Haitian migrants who often cross the border illegally. The darker-skinned, French Creole-speaking Haitians are resented by many Dominicans, leading to discrimination, mass deportations and even lynchings.</p>

		<p>Do not believe this story.  It is impossible for People of Color to be racist.  Ethnic and racial strife is only found among Whites and never among other races.  Therefore, this event did not happen.</p>

<p>Dominicans have been killing Haitians for a long time now.</p>
<p>Most infamously many decades ago now the dictator Trujillo perpetrated the Parsley Massacre against illegal Haitian &#8220;migrants&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley_Massacre" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsley_Massacre</a></p>
<p>Read it all. About 20,000 Haitians killed in a five day span!!</p>
<p>These figures always amaze me. In the U.S., about 2,500 blacks were lynched in the period of about 50 YEARS! In the Dominican Republic, they committed a much greater mass murder just magnitudes beyond anything ever done in the U.S.</p>

		<p> Although circumspect around whites, Dominicans are the most race conscious Caribbean peoples. They like to talk among themselves about &#8220;good hair&#8221;, &#8220;mellow (yellow) complexions&#8221;, while heaping contempt on Haitian &#8220;red bones&#8221; and &#8220;burnt skillet blonds&rdquo; Most Dominicans are Spanish speaking mulattos with some Indian intermixture, who despise the full blooded blacks of Haiti. For them, the worst part of their history was their occupation by Haiti. Many try to pretend they&rsquo;re Puerto Rican in order to settle here in the United States. With reason, they are fearful of the Haitians demographic takeover of their Island nation.</p>

<p>Haitians tend to be dark, because when they revolted 150 years ago, they first killed every single White man, woman and child.  Then they turned on the mulattoes, the mixed-breed offspring of Whites and blacks.  They killed all of those people also   &mdash;   their own half-brothers and sisters, cousins and nieces.  With these people, slight differences in skin color determined life or death.  If you had light chocolate-colored skin, instead of black skin, you were killed.   </p>

<p>Curiously, it wasn&rsquo;t quite all the whites who were killed; it was the French majority. A large group of Polish soldiers from the French army went over to the rebel side. See &#8220;Lost White Tribes&#8221; by Riccardo Orizio for a description of their lighter skinned mixed-race descendants still maintaining a Polish identity in remote mountain regions of Haiti.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure this was the White Man pitting them against eachother. Just a way for the White Man to get the other races pitted against eachother so he can keep his white power structure going.  </p>

		<p>The Haitian dictators who took over and enslaved and slaughtered the Haitian blacks also invaded Santo Domingo and ruled it in order to extract its wealth and pay their French war reparations. The Dominicans still don&rsquo;t appreciate the Haitian invasion of Santo Domingo or the Haitian hypocrisy in fighting for Haitian freedom, then invading their next-door-neighbor Santo Domingo to enslave them.</p>

Why should this situation exist?  NY City is overflowing with Dominicans, as is much of the East Coast by now. Whole huge parts of NYC have been taken over by them.  Most of them came here illegally, or their parents did.  If they were in their own country, where they belong, there would be no shortage of labor there and no need to import Haitians to do the work.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Very true.  Tan is OK, but not purple. </p>
<p>The Dominicans have an interesting, very hypocritical, and very Latin attitude toward race. While they come in various shades of tan or light brown, they have no use for the black Haitians. In short, while they insist (like all Latins) that they are not prejudiced and are blind to race, they have zero tolerance for anyone who is darker than they are. Up to their degree of darkness is alright   &mdash;   but no darker!</p>
