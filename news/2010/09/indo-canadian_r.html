<h1>Indo-Canadian Radio Host&rsquo;s Life Threatened</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Matas, Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tensions within Metro Vancouver&rsquo;s bustling Indo-Canadian community are escalating, with a talk-show host at a Punjabi-language radio station receiving a death threat hours after a drive-by shooting at the home of the station manager.</p>
<p>Gurpreet Singh, who opens the phone lines to listeners of Radio India six mornings a week, received the threat Monday in the mail. In the two-page letter, written in Punjabi, the writers threaten to shoot Mr. Singh in broad daylight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t rest now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we are waiting for an opportunity,&#8221; the letter writers say.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh is accused in the letter of being &#8220;a traitor&#8221; to Sikhs. &#8220;We treat you as an enemy,&#8221; the letter writers say. &#8220;We pray to the almighty when we get a chance and we confront each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter writers also threaten to kill station manager Maninder Gill. Around 10 shots were fired at Mr. Gill&rsquo;s home shortly after midnight Monday. No one was injured.</p>
<p>Ujjal Dosanjh, who was viciously attacked in the 1980s by members of the Indo-Canadian community critical of his views, urged the community to remain calm. &#8220;There already has been too much violence in the [Indo-Canadian] community over the years, and now this,&#8221; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Dosanjh considered the threats on Mr. Gill and Mr. Singh to be threats against freedom of expression, similar to those against him more than 25 years ago. &#8220;It&rsquo;s the idea that journalists in the 21st century in Canada are being threatened,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is absolutely unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I urge everyone to just calm down, let police do the work, let the courts pronounce on whatever happens before the court. Ultimately, violence does not do any good to anyone,&#8221; Mr. Dosanjh said.</p>
<p>Acrimony in the community flared up following a controversial radio broadcast in May. Three community members  &mdash;  Jaspal Atwal, Harkirat Kular and Harjit Atwal  &mdash;  subsequently filed a defamation case against Radio India, the radio&rsquo;s manager Mr. Gill and several journalists as a result of the program. A few weeks after the lawsuit began, Harjit Atwal was shot in the leg following an argument at a wedding. Mr. Gill was charged with aggravated assault and discharging a weapon.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh, 40, has worked as a journalist for 15 years, writing for mainstream English-language newspapers in India before coming to Canada in 2001. He currently freelances for Vancouver&rsquo;s Georgia Straight and Hindustan Times, a national paper in India, in addition to hosting Radio India programs.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh said he was not involved in the programming that led to the defamation lawsuit. His listeners on many occasions have been angry with positions he has taken in his radio editorials, but they call and let him know, he said. &#8220;Never, ever have I received a threat letter that uses these kinds of words. It&rsquo;s the first time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He felt he could not take the threat lightly, especially after the drive-by shooting at Mr. Gill&rsquo;s house, but he did not intend to change his show. &#8220;Nothing can stop me from writing or speaking my mind,&#8221; Mr. Singh said.</p>
<p>Constable Peter Neily of the Surrey RCMP said police are interviewing witnesses, reviewing the evidence and attempting to identify a suspect. A safety plan has been drawn up for Mr. Singh.</p>
<p>It was premature to say whether the threat was related to the drive-by shooting, Constable Neily said.<br>

<p><i>Ujjal Dosanjh, who was viciously attacked in the 1980s by members of the Indo-Canadian community critical of his views, urged the community to remain calm. &ldquo;There already has been too much violence in the [Indo-Canadian] community over the years, and now this&rdquo;</i> </p>
<p><br>
As a heritage-stock white Canadian, I would say that ANY amount of violence from nontraditional nonwhite immigrants qualifies as &ldquo;too much violence.&rdquo; </p>
<p>If we Euro-Canadians had been warned that there would be ANY violence from these new non-Euro immigrants, we would never have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; back in that 1965 referendum about letting Third World hordes into Canada. </p>
<p>Oh wait, I forgot   &mdash;   there NEVER WAS any referendum about letting Third World immigrants into Canada. Canadians didn&rsquo;t vote for this because they were NEVER ASKED. In 1965 the Liberal Party simply decided they&rsquo;d fling open our doors to the entire world, without bothering to ask us first. </p>
<p>And now, as a result, we have levels of ethnic violence in Canada that even members of that ethnicity admit is &#8220;too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey all you Sikhs and other subcontinental types, want to be welcome in Canada? Then get your community&rsquo;s level of &#8220;community violence&#8221; down to ZERO. </p>
<p>Either that or take it back to the Punjab, &#8216;cause it sure doesn&rsquo;t belong HERE. </p>

		<p>I think death threats over political differences are happening much more than people realize. Probably most are never reported and the victim decides to keep his opinions to himself. I think white activists are over represented among the victims to the extent that it is hindering our movement. I wonder if there is any data on the crime. It&rsquo;s a difficult crime to catch but I think the government could do more. When the chances of arrest are small then make the punishment extremely severe. Sting operations might be useful. In cases like this story, the government should feel responsible to get the controversial ideas broadcast so that knowledge is not suppressed. Have government spokesmen say the ideas.  </p>

		<p>Canada&rsquo;s ethnic gangsters and terrorists can count on their communities not to snitch.  </p>
<p>Lebanese - drug importing, money laundering, tax evasion.</p>
<p>Vietnamese - marijuana grow operations</p>
<p>Iranians - drugs and gangsterism</p>
<p>Chinese - theft of proprietary knowledge, forgery</p>
<p>Blacks - street crime, prostitution, fraud</p>
<p>A white undercover officer can&rsquo;t infiltrate a Somali or Vietnamese-speaking gang.  Canadian police are forced to expend enormous effort cultivating intelligence resources to penetrate closed communities.   </p>

		<p>I understand that the Ethnic Media such as<br>
Punjabi can be incredibly Racist (however defined)<br>
and Politically incorrect - compared to the <br>
English Language media. They also say stuff<br>
about White People that is pretty nasty.<br>
There is a White Reporter Who covers Indo stuff<br>
has had allot of abuse.</p>
