<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-09-10-immigration10_ST_N.htm">U.S. Shifts Approach to Deporting Illegal Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marcus Stern, USA Today, September 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration is changing the federal immigration enforcement strategy in ways that reduce the threat of deportation for millions of illegal immigrants, even as states such as Arizona, Colorado, Virginia, Ohio and Texas are pushing to accelerate deportations.</p>
<p>The changes focus enforcement on immigrants who have committed serious crimes, an effort to unclog immigration courts and detention centers. A record backlog of deportation cases has forced immigrants to wait an average 459 days for their hearings, according to an Aug. 12 report by Syracuse University&rsquo;s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), which analyzes government data.</p>
<p>Among the recent changes:</p>
<p>* Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton ordered agency officials on Aug. 20 to begin dismissing deportation cases against people who haven&rsquo;t committed serious crimes and have credible immigration applications pending.</p>
<p>* A proposed directive from Morton posted on ICE&rsquo;s website for public comment last month would generally prohibit police from using misdemeanor traffic stops to send people to ICE. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s new direction puts it at odds with those who believe the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws should be strictly enforced and that all illegal immigrants should be deported.</p>
<p>ICE is &#8220;thumbing its nose at the law,&#8221; said Rep. Steve King of Iowa, the top Republican on the House immigration subcommittee.</p>
<p>The changes have also drawn complaints from immigration advocates. They say deportations under Obama are at record highs and immigrants who remain behind are living in limbo, without work permits, Social Security cards or driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of criminal immigrants removed by ICE &#8220;climbed to an all-time high,&#8221; the report [an August 12 TRAC report] said. In fiscal 2010, which began Oct. 1, &#8220;The removal pace of criminal aliens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is fully 60% higher than in the last year of the Bush administration, and at least a third (37%) higher than in the first year of the Obama administration.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Pardon me?  It&rsquo;s impossible to &#8220;shift&#8221; one&rsquo;s &#8220;approach to deporting illegal aliens&#8221; if one never had an &#8220;approach&#8221; to begin with, much less actually deported anyone.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile&hellip; Earlier this week in Charlotte, 2 illegals ran down a 6 year old boy on his bike and kept going. One of them had ALREADY been deported once. Does this qualify them for deportation Mr. Morton? After all, the boy didn&rsquo;t die so that&rsquo;s a good thing right? Define &#8220;serious crimes&#8221; please. Drunk driving? Nah, not bad enough right? Rape, assault, murder? Because obviously being in the country illegally is no longer a crime, so just come out and say it and be done with it.</p>

		<p>This is the government&rsquo;s new strategy, back door amnesty. Instead of having official amnesty, they simply don&rsquo;t enforce the law and the courts and government strike down any attempts to control illegal migration.</p>

		<p>This continues to be a lesson learned. Had we put up a DMZ in 1848 and manned it accordingly, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem now. We may get another shot at it in the future with a somewhat smaller country; I just hope we get it right the next time around.</p>

Why is there a record backlog? Because their are a record number of criminal aliens in the US. THAT FACT should force our government to admit to the problem and take serious action. <br>

		<p>Obama is so fanatically resentful of whites he feels fanatically compelled at all costs to reduce the number of whites in this country per their percentage of the population.</p>
<p>He uses the white self-hating radicals, but he really doesn&rsquo;t like them either.</p>

		<p>Where is all this going?  There&rsquo;s already so many millions of non-whites who arrived here in the last ten years and twenty years.  Whites (Northern European extraction) are already only about 30% of the population.  The other 20% are southern and eastern europeans who never became &#8216;wasps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Anything over 50% &#8216;white&rsquo; that our government counts as &#8216;white&rsquo; are arabs, turks, afghans, north africans, &#8216;white&rsquo; mexicans, puerto ricans and dozens of others.  (The government admits to counting all of them as &#8216;white&rsquo;.  Look it up)</p>
<p>If &#8216;wasps&rsquo; are now only 30% of the population, and we are the ones who created this country and its political institutions, then what will 10, 20 or 30 years look like in the future?  Especially when the non-whites realize they are holding all the cards?  </p>
<p>Can I buy land in a rural area to escape?  The local farmers will keep on hiring illegal mexicans and bring them wherever I go. What if I get old and need modern conveniences but they are all in the hands of non-whites? </p>
<p>Canada is also out as an option because the cities are filled with chinese and jamaicans and the rural areas are filled with indigenous Indians who are asserting themselves again violently.</p>

		<p>The good news is that the next administration - in 2012 if things go the way they&rsquo;re looking likely to go - can always order ICE to get serious.</p>
<p>Whether they will or not remains to be seen, as the GOP is notorious for pandering to folks who won&rsquo;t vote GOP anyway.</p>
<p>Illegal reentry after a previous felony conviction and subsequent deportation is also a felony by itself.  Federal sentencing guidelines give these perps two years (of which they must serve a minimum of 21 months).</p>

		<p>Sounds like something Bush would&rsquo;ve done.  And Clinton before him.  There is nothing new, at least since 1986, in our presidents&rsquo; trying everything in their power to get and keep illegal aliens from south of the border.</p>
