<h1>Gang Members Blast City, Police Policies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBBM-AM (Chicago), September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a news conference organized by self-identified gang members Thursday morning, several speakers complained that police and city officials do not respect them, and that the only way to curb violence is to provide jobs and improve their community.</p>
<p>The self-described current and former gang members held a news conference at the Columbus Park Refectory, at 5701 W. Jackson Blvd. on the city&rsquo;s West Side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it&rsquo;s gangs, drugs and guns. We say we need jobs, opportunities and contracts,&#8221; said Reginald Akeem Berry Sr., who identified himself as a former gang member. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are taking issue with Weis&rsquo; [Chicago police Superintendent Jody Weis] strategy of meeting with gang leaders and warning them of serious consequences if violence continues.</p>
<p>Weis held a meeting with the reputed leaders of several West Side gangs at the Garfield Park Conservatory over the weekend. At the meeting, prosecutors warned that the gang members could be charged under the federal racketeering laws if killings were traced back to gangs with members attending the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But at the news conference, the speakers said the city should be working to place young African-American men in jobs, particularly those with criminal records who have paid their debt to society.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the speakers said repeatedly that they do not condone the violence in the community and &#8220;gang banging&#8221; and want to stop it. But they argued that gangs are not the cause of the violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep saying gang violence. It&rsquo;s drug-related. It&rsquo;s not gang related. It&rsquo;s drug related,&#8221; Akeem Berry said.</p>
<p>Gang members have also taken issue directly with the meeting Weis organized. They say they were tricked into coming to the meeting, and that it amounted to harassment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Another Violent Night</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was another violent night in Chicago, as one gang-related shooting quickly led to another in retaliation.</p>
<p>In the latest incident, a 14-year-old boy was shot around 7:30 p.m. in the 8300 block of South Baltimore Avenue in the South Chicago neighborhood. A gunman approached on foot and shot him in the thigh, said a South Chicago District police sergeant, adding that the boy is an alleged gang member.</p>
<p>About 8:43 p.m., a 20-year-old man was shot in the left arm in the 8300 block of South Phillips Avenue when an unknown gunman wearing sunglasses opened fire from a passing vehicle, said the sergeant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were several other shootings overnight for which the motive has not yet been released. One of them was fatal.</p>

		<p>This is no surprise.  In fact, this is the inevitable consequence of Jody Weis&rsquo;s (&#8220;J-Fed&#8221;) getting down on his knees and begging gang-bangers to behave meeting four days ago.  He essentially granted legitimacy to the gangs in Chicago, so is it any wonder they hold a press conference today, and the media show up?</p>
<p>My other thoughts:</p>

<p>All in all, you&rsquo;ve got Daley/Weis on one side and the Vice Lords/Gangsta Disciples on the other side.  I don&rsquo;t have a dog in the fight, but I&rsquo;ll enjoy the fight anyway.</p>

		<p>So black gangs are actually holding press conferences, now?  Why am I not surprised?  Black thugs are permitted   &mdash;    nay, <i>encouraged</i>   &mdash;   to hold their own press conferences, while White Nationalist gatherings are subject to harassment, demonization and ridicule.  This is called &#8220;equality,&#8221; of course.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We say we need jobs, opportunities and contracts,&rdquo; said Reginald Akeem Berry.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, O Mighty Zulu Warrior, why don&rsquo;t you stop your public posturing and <i>get</i> a job?  What exactly is stopping you?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;the speakers said the city should be working to place young African-American men in jobs, particularly those with criminal records who have paid their debt to society.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So, then, it&rsquo;s &#8220;Society&rsquo;s&#8221; responsibility to find jobs for young black criminals?  Did <i>anyone</i> dare to ask &#8220;why?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;You keep saying gang violence. It&rsquo;s drug-related. It&rsquo;s not gang related. It&rsquo;s drug related,&rdquo; Akeem Berry said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, &#8220;Akeem.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s <i>black</i> related.  Violence and drugs are what blacks do.<br>

		<p>Virtually every government employee in and around Chicago whether city, county, state or fed is black or Hispanic. All these jobs have been given to blacks regardless of total lack of minimal qualifications and total lack of competency on the job.</p>
<p>Guess Daley will have to create more affirmative action do nothing jobs for the White taxpayers to support.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 hit the nail on the head.  By having open meetings with gang members they are now legitimized as an entity that can be negotiated with.  In other words, they have a form of sovereignty now.</p>
<p>When social order breaks down, its the gangs that will move into the power vacuum and set up mini states.  The new dark ages will commence in probably less than 30 years tops, though in some parts of the country the transition is already taking place.  These would be the areas where whites no longer feel safe enough to go.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Dateline NBC devoted their whole hour to &#8220;youth&#8221; crime in Chicago.  Its last segment featured an &#8220;ex-&#8221; gang-banger who found jobs for existing gang-bangers in construction, and it showed a young black man working at a construction site as &#8220;proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where is this &#8220;reformed&#8221; gang banger coming up with all these construction jobs, when white men who have played by the rules their whole lives can&rsquo;t find jobs?  Either he&rsquo;s really not &#8220;reformed,&#8221; and is working for the mob, (construction + Chicago = Cosa Nostra), or he&rsquo;s the quiet middleman for various government affirmative action programs and mandates in construction programs.</p>

<p>But of course, there will NEVER be jobs in the inner city as long as Obama and the Federal government continue massive importation of wage slaves from Mexico.</p>
<p>Our government cares nothing about unemployment in the inner-city.  If they can reduce salary costs by a few cents by hiring cheap foreign worker, then good   &mdash;   inner-city kids, and other American workers can go to H***!  Pure greed.  And they sell this greed to the gullible public as as &#8220;America is the great melting pot&#8221; and &#8220;they only want a better life.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>There are no gangs in Chicago. <br>
There is no crime in Chicago.<br>
There are no killings in Chicago.<br>
Everything is wonderful in Chicago.</p>
<p>I know this to be true, because for the last 40 years, Jessie Jackson and his son, Louis Farrakhan, The Reverend Wright, and Obama have been given hundreds of millions of Dollars to fix Chicago.  In total, we have probably spent Billions of Dollars over the last 40 years just on the Chicago South Side, alone.  </p>
<p>If none of this improved Chicago, then 20 years of &#8220;Community organizing&#8221; by Obama and billions of $$$ were simply wasted.  I know that Americans would not waste money like that, and would not have elected Obama, if his community organizing had been a failure.  Therefore I know that everything is fine in Chicago, and that all my tax money went to a good cause. In fact, I predict that Obama will make similar magnificent improvements to America, as he has demonstrated in Chicago.  It&rsquo;s a bright future for us.  Now please pass the soma.</p>

		<p>The crime statistics, including the shootings, are skewed and misleading. Within the white population there are just a handful of burglars, holdup men, etc, and just a small number of murders. Of the murders committed by whites most are of the usual domestic and feud types; bad but probably unavoidable in any population. The crime grabbing the headlines is almost all a black phenomenon, with hispanics playing a secondary role. Even there it&rsquo;s narrowed down to a smaller subset of their neighborhoods. Problems arise when they leave the ghetto areas and look for white victims to prey upon. The costs are tremendous for us whites; we pay for their welfare, medical costs, schooling, jailing, social workers, judges, police, jails and prisons, the list is endless. The ghetto people pay nothing, of course. Oh, and let me dispel the notion that gangbangers really just crave jobs. They do not, repeat, do not, want to work. Work is for chumps, for squares, you have to show up regularly someplace. It&rsquo;s all a different culture; believe me, I know from everyday observation. Some of these gangbangers are second and third generation members; they&rsquo;re born into it.    </p>

		<p>Shifting blame onto others is apart of black irresponsibility which is a major theme in black life.  The reality is the black people who are into selling drugs do it because they want the fast money and the cache it gives them.  Providing regular 9 to 5 jobs for them is not appealing to them unless they pull an Omar Thornton and resell company products.  So don&rsquo;t think twice that maybe if jobs were provided to them they would stop their mayhem because they won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely right.  If those who control the wealth in places like mexico and africa were to focus on jobs, opportunities and normal economies instead of slave labor, drug empires and satanic cannibal cults of death, then that would solve the violence problem their citizens cause when they come to America and go on welfare.</p>

		<p>Gee, with the economy as lousy as it is, I&rsquo;d sure like for somebody to<i>place</i> me in a job. Heck, I can read and write, interact in a non-threatening manner with the public, accept criticism and even handle jerks on the job without attacking or killing anyone. All that plus many years of wide-ranging work experience, and yet I still have to go out and find my own jobs. Oddly enough, between gigs I&rsquo;ve never had any interest in dealing drugs, killing my rivals or beating and robbing random citizens. I guess I&rsquo;m just old-fashioned.</p>

		<p>You have to realize that these gangs are not really gangs, they&rsquo;re &#8220;communities.&#8221; Why, just a few weeks ago here in North Carolina an MS-13 member was sentenced to death for murder. According to the news reporter this was to send a message to the &#8220;MS-13 community.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Like the Nuremburg War Crimes defendants, these gang members are denying they are responsible for all the gang shootings in Chicago. Unlike the war criminals at Nuremburg, these gang members are denying they kill under orders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thugs like these who don&rsquo;t have to register their guns, because that would violate their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination; while Daley makes the law-abiding jump through hoops just to own a handgun.</p>

		<p>You can see where this is going.  They will push for the ending of felony convictions barring minority applicants from procuring a job.  Their twisted logic will be that the racist justice system unfairly targets minorities, namely black and hispanics, and that their ability to get straight and live a normal, productive life is severely hampered by these outmoded requirements.  This will be a civil rights issue.  Count on Eric Holder to move this one to the front burner.</p>

		<p>17 The Peloponnesian:</p>
<p>The Mayor of Kansas City MO has already called for the KCPD to hire people with adult felony convictions to be cops.  (FYI, said mayor is a white man, who, Steve Cohen-style, slipped through in a primary against multiple blacks in a heavily black city to become mayor, and has been able to hang on ever since.)  Now, in this instance, I think it&rsquo;s a rhetorical bait and switch, because he said it at the time when the KCPD was in Federal court over its testing procedures, i.e. they actually administered tests with standards, ergo the blacks flunked them more often.  Mr. Mayor was proposing an obviously illegal measure (hint:  felons can&rsquo;t possess guns), to make the less ridiculous but equally insane measures seem sublime.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, AR had the story about Detroit Mayor Dave Bing wanting to put a convicted murderer on the BOPC.  (Incidentally, that wouldn&rsquo;t happen in St. Louis or Kansas City, as the state controls both PDs, and the Governor appoints all but one of the BOPC members of each city, and even the kookiest wacko leftist that MO&rsquo;s body politic could produce for a Governor would NEVER appoint a convicted murderer in those seats.  Personally, instead of repealing state control, a hot issue in STL and KC, more states should adopt the Missouri model, i.e state control over their heavily black big city departments.  Not even Jennifer Granholm would put a convicted murderer on Detroit&rsquo;s BOPC.)</p>
<p>But you see where it&rsquo;s all going, and you&rsquo;re 100% correct   &mdash;   for the sake of &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; we&rsquo;re going to have to dismantle quality (i.e. felony checks for certain job applicants) to attain equality. </p>
