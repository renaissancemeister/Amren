<h1>Racial Divide Shows Up On Walmart Book Shelves</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Dyer, Akron Beacon, Sept. 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At many area Walmarts, the book section is extremely well-organized.</p>
<p>The self-help books are here &hellip; the religion section is there &hellip; cooking and diet books farther down &hellip; and right over here is the black section.</p>
<p>{snips}</p>
<p>The &#8220;black section&#8221; contains everything written by and about blacks: romance novels, self-help books, religion, sports, even an autobiography by the current president of the United States.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you&rsquo;re a fan of Barack Obama, can&rsquo;t we at least agree that the thing that defines him is not his skin color but his job title? We have lots and lots of African-Americans in this country  &mdash;  about 38 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau  &mdash;  but during this country&rsquo;s entire 234-year history we have had only 44 presidents.</p>
<p>Yet there he is, right in the middle of six monochromatic shelves, peering out at us from the cover of The Audacity of Hope.</p>
<p>At the Walmart on Arlington Road in Springfield Township, you&rsquo;ll find two fancy, hardcover books by people who are household names in professional football. Drew Brees, quarterback of the 2009 Super Bowl champion</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints, smiles on the cover of Coming Back Stronger: Unleashing the Hidden Power of Adversity. Tony Dungy, coach of the 2006 Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts, smiles on the cover of The Mentor Leader. </p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t find those books side by side. Why? Because Brees is white and Dungy is black.</p>
<p>The black guy goes in the black section. After all, who other than a black person would want to read a book by an insightful, ethical, inspirational football coach?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wal-Mart responds</p>
<p>When asked why many of its stores have a &#8220;black section&#8221; that lumps together everyone from romance novelists to preachers to the president of the United States  &mdash;  even though they have little in common beside skin color  &mdash;  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. responded without really responding.</p>
<p>&#8220;The book sections in our stores are designed to meet customer demand and feedback at the local level,&#8221; read an e-mail from Phillip Keene, a media-relations official at the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like many national bookstores, and book sections at retailers across the country, some of our stores have a section for African-American-focused books, while a store in a different area of the country might have a large science-fiction section or Western section&hellip; .</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wal-Mart is doing nothing more than feeding one of this country&rsquo;s worst habits: looking at absolutely everything in black and white.</p>
<p>No one can dispute that skin color colors much of how we perceive things and how we are perceived. But not everything is black and white. And until we can get that through our collective heads, we have no chance of solving the race problem that has haunted this country for centuries and periodically threatens to tear it apart. <br>

<p>This is an exercise in futility? Most black folks hardly ever read anyhow. Having a &#8220;section&#8221; for &#8220;them&#8221; encourages them to read what they want to read? Sort of a for-us-by-us type of thing? I think not!</p>

		<p>What an IDIOT this guy is.  Go to any library, you dolt, and you will find the SAME THING.  The dewey decimal system is designed by topic, not author, except if the book is fiction.  Politics here.  Guns there.  Arts and crafts over there.  Black history right there.  etc.  Why do these libtards always seek racial affront?  Even when there is no racial affront?  That&rsquo;s the unbiased and logical reason for the arrangement.  Now, does libtard Dyer want the un-PC reason?  Blacks are illiterate, cannot use the card catalog or the online catalog, and are essentially lazy.  Therefore, putting everything black in one section for them makes them happy.  And removes stress.  If it were otherwise, the blacks would accuse us of trying to &#8220;hide&#8221; black books from them and scattering them all over the place.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way Dyer, did you bother to go to the political section to see if there were other copies of Obango&rsquo;s book?  Or to the sports section to see if there were also copies of your favorite black football star THERE also?  No, didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>Blacks certainly do not mind segregating themselves at all, but they sure find it very upsetting when white people segregate them.  Seems it&rsquo;s not the segregation they mind, it&rsquo;s the white people.<br>
Wal-Mart can&rsquo;t win.  If they don&rsquo;t have a special section for black books, blacks will complain that they&rsquo;re being ignored like the invisible man.  We already know what happened when they had a special section.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, whether or not you&rsquo;re a fan of Barack Obama, can&rsquo;t we at least agree that the thing that defines him is not his skin color but his job title?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;President&#8221; is a temporary job title; race is a permanent characteristic.  Obama will eventually not be President, but he will never be any race but black.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can dispute that skin color colors much of how we perceive things &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it is not color alone, it&rsquo;s experience too.  We weren&rsquo;t born yesterday, but we&rsquo;re told that our personal experience is invalid when it comes to race because it constitutes &#8220;prejudice&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m tired of being told I have to act like a blank-minded idiot with no personal experience of blacks because my experience is not allowed to be considered valid.  It is valid.<br>
The era when blacks could not be held accountable for their actions as a race is ending.  If they want to be better thought of as a race, they are going to have to behave better as a race.  If they can, though experience argues otherwise.  Regardless, the era of the free ride is over. </p>

Wow! Do newspapers have so little to report that they have to concoct articles like this?  (If so, I could suggest a number of topics that need investigation.)</p>
<p>The store probably has a &#8220;gay&#8221; section, a religious section, one for photography fans, etc.  Is anybody complaining?</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;Wal-Mart is doing nothing more than feeding one of this country&rsquo;s worst habits: looking at absolutely everything in black and white.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Wal-Mart is doing nothing more than RECOGNIZING that is how blacks look at everything, and Walmart is simply being realistic.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Now, whether or not you&rsquo;re a fan of Barack Obama, can&rsquo;t we at least agree that the thing that defines him is not his skin color but his job title?&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>No.  He wasn&rsquo;t elected on the basis of anything but his skin color. Let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves.  If not for that one thing, he&rsquo;d still be a Community Organizer. If you imagine otherwise, you&rsquo;re either in denial or delusional.</p>

		<p>The columnist seems to think Walmart does this because white people aren&rsquo;t interested in books by black authors. Well, I&rsquo;d bet my front teeth that the real reason   &mdash;   the &#8220;feedback on a local level&#8221;   &mdash;   is, in fact, black customers demanding their own segregate book section because *they* are the ones not interested in books by white folks. How anyone could not perceive this obvious dynamic in our society, except by willful blindness, is beyond me. Does the columnist also think white people force blacks to have BET (&#8220;segregated tv&#8221;) and Black History Month (&#8220;segregated history&#8221;), rather than black people preferring it that way because they want to celebrate their own culture separately from ours?</p>

<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t speak for other people but I&rsquo;m not interested in reading &#8220;black&#8221; books.  I&rsquo;m willing to bet that other Whites aren&rsquo;t either and will even go so far as to say that most literate blacks don&rsquo;t read anything other than magazines or porn. The last time I checked other stores like Books-a-Million and Barnes and Noble had their own black sections. Is there some special reason why Walmart is being targeted?  I don&rsquo;t know what the policy is for unsold books, whether they&rsquo;re shipped back to the publisher or sold to discount stores at cut rates but I bet those books stay on the shelves for months before being removed. Having them centrally located cuts down on the time it takes to find them and get rid of them.      </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from a bio on the writer of this nonsense article, Bob Dyer:<br>
http://www.ohio.com/news/dyer/19718379.html</p>
<p>&#8220;Dyer also was one of the lead writers for A Question of Color, a yearlong examination of racial attitudes in Akron that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose we can consider Dyer to be a self-hating white person who made a career out of pouting about racial attitudes.</p>
<p>I, for one, am glad that African-American fiction stuff is separated. It works out for everybody.</p>

<p>Yet there they are at my local Meijer&rsquo;s&hellip;videos like: Dr. Doolittle with Eddie Murphy and Sanford and Son with Redd Foxx. How about &ldquo;Save The Last Dance,&rdquo; mixed in with the drama, sci-fi, cartoons, and horror? Oh, and the drama and horror has an added bonus beyond that which is filmed as fantasy: actual hogs and dogs with their nonwhite paramours in the flesh and feeding at the foul septic trough of multiculturalism!</p>
<p>Sorry Comrades Dyer and Beacon, I find it very hard to be simpatico with your offended or even scandalized sense of Marxist prudishness!</p>

		<p> Bob Dyer seems to suffer from what might be called &#8220;White Liberal Derangement Syndrome.&#8221; That is, he wastes a lot of time worrying and agonizing about the problems of people who don&rsquo;t look like him   &mdash;   such as, oh, blacks, for instance.</p>
<p> Mr. Dyer, did it occur to you that blacks may like having stuff written by one of their own placed in its own section so it&rsquo;s easier for them to find? And by the same token, people of other hues who might want to read it, can find it easily, also.</p>
<p> If it&rsquo;s so bad that we keep viewing &#8220;everything in black and white&#8221; in this country, as you say, Mr. Dyer, then why do we have a Miss Black America contest? Why are there Black Student Associations on college campuses? Why do police departments have separate, all-black organizations for officers of African descent?</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t you think we should do away with them, too, while you&rsquo;re having a major hemorrhage over Wal-Mart&rsquo;s placement of reading material? Or did your &#8220;White guilt&#8221; rash just need a thorough scratching today?</p>

		<p>When it comes to commerce, the foremost concern is making sales to customers.  Surely, this is what Wal-Mart is most concerned about, but of course, to lefties, Wal-Mart is a bugaboo.  <br>
My local bookstores have sections labeled as Local Interest, which means that the volumes are by and about hillbillies.  A book about Sen. Robert Byrd would be here rather than in a section about the government, just as Obama&rsquo;s is in the Wal-Mart black interest section.  <br>
Anything concerning blacks in any way is, of course, vulnerable to scathing criticism  &mdash;  which is one reason why so many non-blacks resent them.</p>

		<p>But if the few black authored books were mixed in with all the &#8216;white books&rsquo; then the voodoos would complain that there&rsquo;s not enough &#8216;black books&rsquo; in the store.</p>
<p>Strangely enough you don&rsquo;t have a separate asian section, with their books usually mixed in with the white books.  I have yet to see a &#8216;latino&rsquo; section, come to think of it, save for a couple of racial-oriented authors, I don&rsquo;t know of any latinos who write in English.  Oh, there&rsquo;s the spanish section!</p>

		<p>Another case of damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t. Wal-Mart obviously created these black sections in an effort to appeal to their black customers, who, how shall we say, are not exactly the world&rsquo;s biggest readers. And rather than being recognized as the pandering that it is, some clueless white writer sees it as another sign of &#8220;discrimination!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m offend he wrote &#8220;black section&#8221;.  Always refer to the blacks as African Americans, especially when they are proving that feral Africanisms such as robbery, rape, murder are more durable than &#8220;acting White by reading books and staying in school&#8221;.</p>
<p>When your local newspaper dares give the description of a criminal suspect as &#8220;black,&#8221; complain loudly and boycott all advertisers until an apologize is issued and the corrected &#8220;African American&#8221; is used.  &#8220;African Americans&#8221; get too many race credits, and it is our responsibility to make their race debits stick just as hard.  They have such vastly more debits than credits, it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard. That it is hard is evidence of a very sick, perverted, corrosive, and dangerous lock on the media by unmentionable forces of evil and power.</p>
<p>Barak Hussein O&rsquo;bama does define himself by his skin color, therefore Whites should be forced to define him by his skin color and draw all the correct inferences from his Africanism, otherwise we are &#8220;acting stupidly,&#8221; and failing in our God given mandate to make &#8220;dangerous discoveries&#8221; when before us.  We must &#8220;increase the intensity&#8221;.</p>
<p>White Humanity&rsquo;s compliments to Walmart for segregating the African culture from the Whites.  Sends a good message to White girls that some of the books sections are dangerous and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Worship God- Praise Segregation- Pray for your black brothers and sisters to make safely back home to Ghana.</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity- Embrace Whiteness- Beware and Prepare!</p>

<p>No. Wal-Mart is giving blacks what they would demand; their own section.</p>
<p>If black books were interspersed with other books, blacks would complain they were being marginalized and weren&rsquo;t being given the special recognition they feel they deserve.</p>
<p>This author goes to prove my old adage about blacks; no matter what you do, blacks will complain. Separate sections promote segregation. Unified collections dilute black significance.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, you can&rsquo;t win.</p>

		<p>You can sort the Walmart stores in my vicinity by the racial diversity of the people. I find the whiter the store is the better the service and the neater the shelves are. As the years go by I&rsquo;m finding I have to drive farther to get a pleasant shopping experience. Recently a new store opened in what used to by farming country. It&rsquo;s a bit of a drive but it&rsquo;s well worth it. </p>

		<p>Most of those books, even if they are about business or politics, probably have a black author who writes about his experiences, as a black person, and at least that is a small part of the book - to say nothing of the romances and relationship books where an authentic black voice becomes paramount. And of course, most are likely to take a leftist, black favored political slant, even in the odd case where the author doesn&rsquo;t incorporate his special &#8216;blackness&rsquo; or a conscious black viewpoint, into the book. </p>
<p>The question is&hellip; why is their not a white section at walmart where authors are presented who are exploring the topic of how events effect them, as a white person?</p>
<p>Leftists have created a world where race means everything yet whites have become completely deracinated, in a sense unpersons, only fit to apologize as their country and in some cases their lives are taken from them. Even if you&rsquo;re not a rabid AmRener or worse, and you subscribe to Dyer&rsquo;s, and MLK&rsquo;s version of paradise, the only way to &#8216;end walmarts special section for blacks and others (and only books written for those groups)&rsquo; is to demand equal representation, if not consciousness, for whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s seems a golden opportunity and really a win-win all around for white racists. Whether you believe in MLK&rsquo;s dream, or whether you don&rsquo;t, the only logical course of action is to arouse white racial consciousness and include white representation at the police officers association and at the diversity table. That&rsquo;s the very minimum for equality. Leftists have set the table themselves. </p>

		<p>Riding pretty regularly in the subways of New York City, I often glance over to see what reading matter black riders have. It&rsquo;s mostly the sort of trashy novels about a sexy, black &#8220;ghetto queen&#8221; and her amorous escapades, or a black drug dealer with too many women on his hands. I hardly ever see anything else.</p>
<p>In theory more blacks should be reading &#8220;The Audacity of Hope,&#8221; or books like it of a little higher order, but I&rsquo;ve rarely seen those. </p>
<p>So from a marketing point of view, along with a minority of semi-worthwhile reading, it makes sense for Walmart to have a special section for the kind of junk literature that blacks like to consume. So I don&rsquo;t really see any problem with this.</p>

		<p>I, for one, am not complaining about Wal-Mart putting black audience books in a separate section.  Two reasons:  1) whites can browse more freely; and 2) whether these books are located in one section or scattered about, blacks aren&rsquo;t going to read them either way. </p>

<p>The sensible thing to do, if you are a liberal, would be to sue Walmart for not having a white section, and maybe the state of Ohio. When have liberals made sense, however?</p>

		<p>I worked in a Barnes and Noble bookstore during my college years, and my first experience with the premise of &#8220;black sections&#8221; of bookstores was the shock of the black customers themselves at the fact that we didn&rsquo;t have one. Usually it was a black female asking about where she could find the trashy, black-marketed romance novels, and they would often stare in disbelief when told it was mixed in the fiction section with the other stuff. There was a separate subsection in history about black history, but I don&rsquo;t recall that being what was meant by &#8220;black books.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not proud to say that my left-leaning, college-kid reaction at the time was similar to the writer of the piece, thinking that it was &#8220;dangerous&#8221; to separate literature based on race. If people are closed off to reading the works of anyone but their own race, how can we come together (and other drivel)? Well, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot more of the world since then, and don&rsquo;t balk at this activity, especially after exposure to &#8220;black&#8221; television, movies, rap music, etc. They can have it and keep it&hellip;the further away the better.</p>
<p>I assume the black customers wanted their literature separated so they could find it easily and browse for another romantic ghetto fantasy, without being distracted by the works of Dickens or Shakespeare as they scanned the shelves. And maybe they wanted to flaunt to everyone that they were black, and they read black. Who cares anyway? &#8220;The customer is always right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the chain still &#8220;integrates&#8221; all their literature; I knew that the rival book chain Borders did have a separate section for so-called African-American literature.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that a self-appointed race expert and sensitive intellectual like Bob Dyer doesn&rsquo;t go into these major bookstores and hasn&rsquo;t seen the separate black lit section there as well. </p>
<p>No, this is just another exercise in leftist propaganda and here he gets a &#8220;two-fer&#8221;: paint a gigantic corporation as racially insensitive, and bemoan society&rsquo;s apathy at the injustice of denying Mr. White Guy the opportunity to find such fine works as &#8220;Soul on Ice&#8221; or &#8220;Precious&#8221;, as he looks for the latest Dan Brown or James Patterson paperback.</p>
