			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Brooke, Daily Mail (London), September 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The company behind airline food on some of the world&rsquo;s major airlines has announced plans to make the majority of its meals halal.</p>
<p>GateGourmet, which caters for all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, wants to standardise production to drive down costs and boost profits.</p>
<p>The caterer has been tempted into the switch by lucrative business available from Middle Eastern and Asian airlines.</p>
<p>Most carriers currently offer a halal option, but these meals need to be prepared, stored and transported separately in order to comply with Muslim dietary rules  &mdash;  making them more expensive.</p>
<p>Removing halal meals from the menu is not an option for a company serving airlines across the globe, but managers at the Swiss-based catering giant believe it makes financial sense to ensure most meals meet with the strict Islamic rules.</p>
<p> &#8216;My aim is to make our large hub operations halal compliant,&rsquo; said Guy Dubois, GateGroup.</p>
<p>Mr Dubois said the plans were not driven by social or religious considerations, but simply by cost.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;If I produce everything according to halal standards, I will reduce complexity and increase cost effectiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The catering firm is about to open a dedicated halal kitchen at Heathrow  &mdash;  where meals are prepared for 14 airlines including BA.</p>
<p>The specialist kitchen will be smaller than the main kitchen that already exists at the airport, but could be the first stage in a gradual switch.</p>
<p>The move follows the sharp growth of carriers such as Emirates, of Dubai, and Etihad, of Abu Dhabi, which require all meals to be halal.</p>
<p>But GateGourmet caters for numerous airlines from non-Muslim countries, which would also be affected by the changes.</p>
<p>The company prepares more than 200million meals a year from its 100 flight kitchens in more than 25 countries.</p>
<p>Compelling customers to eat food prepared in accordance with the Muslim faith could be controversial in some countries, including the UK.</p>
<p>Yesterday British Airways played down the significance of the catering firm&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8216;British Airways has no plans to change its current menus or halal meal process.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter van Niekerk, head of GateGroup in the UK, said: &#8216;We are at the moment competing for some more halal business and when we make that, the scale tips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said the company would consult with customers such as BA and Cathay Pacific to &#8216;manage perceptions and manage such a transition&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I wonder if this means they would stop offering kosher meals.  But, according to their logic, they should serve only kosher since all food that is kosher is also hallal - but hallal does not qualify as kosher.  By having everything kosher, they would cover all their bases.  Better yet, just leave things alone!</p>

		<p>What I most look forward to in the Islamization of Everything is the changes in U.S. football. No more pigskin footballs.  No more calling it &#8220;the pigskin&#8221;.  No more hog farms that destroy the environment. No more bacon that fills my heart with fat.  No more Diversity is Our Strength mantras being tolerated by blue collar Americans.</p>
<p>I also look forward to all the Franz Boaz cousins in New York City falling under Muslim&rsquo;s Sharia Law first.   </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume Sharia and the Caliphate can&rsquo;t happen everywhere at once.   It will happen where it can happen, and the rest of us can watch and judge and prevent.  Watch for mass exodus from Muslim cities that are vibrant, safe, and diverse.</p>
<p>Watch for nobody to ask why there are no churches in Saudi Arabia.</p>

		<p>Well I know what airlines I won&rsquo;t be using. White European airlines are among the worst anyway. Air Canada and United are horrific. Asian airlines are the best because they hire young and hot women which I expect to be served by for the money I&rsquo;m paying for these flights. They understand the difference between equity and equality. I had some flight attendants in my classes in Korea. They said Korean airlines have beauty standards that women have to meet to get a job. </p>

		<p>I hope other westerners regard this decision on the part of British  Airways the same way I do. Namely a back door effort to impose Islam upon the rest of us. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s reasonable to ask what other &#8220;cost effective measures&#8221; the airline took, such as hiring pilots from countries that are exporting Islamic terror against Slavs and other white Christians? This is one more reason why I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t fly on any airline that&rsquo;s doing what British Airways is doing. It&rsquo;s bad enough that you are a suspect just for boarding an aircraft, and treated like one with those electronic strip searches that other people are recording for their own ends. This would be the final nail in the coffin for me if I was a British citizen.</p>

		<p>If Brits really cared (and I guarantee that Americans would care if subjected to this), they could simply bring bacon with them on their flights and top of their sandwhich.  It would only take a handful of people doing this, openly, to drive all muslims off every flight.</p>
<p>Of course, Britain is so far gone this would probably get you arrested for a hate crime.  Which is the real issue.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, those who rule Britain have made the country a de facto dhimmi state, complete with arrests, imprisonment, and often violence, for the crime of insulting islam.  Jackbooted government thugs don&rsquo;t show up at your door (at least not yet) for this.  Instead, the police turn their backs and give a wink and a nod to violence muslims engage in.  Self-defense is punished with harsh prison sentences.</p>
<p>Brits are basically slaves in their own country.  Why?  Because they don&rsquo;t react with violent revolution to stuff like this?  No.  Because they are too afraid of appearing racist to have their in flight sandwich with bacon.  If things continue along this path, you won&rsquo;t be able to even buy bacon at your local grocery.  Not that it will matter.  Because you won&rsquo;t be allowed to live there&hellip;.unless you are a muslim.</p>

<p>Of course, THEY will never do one slight thing to make YOU happy. There is never reciprocity, is there?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite easily solved. If I am on a flight and the meal is Halal, I will refuse to eat it. We, as the consumers, have all the power, and people seem to forget that. They will lose far more money if non-muslims refuse to eat that food, and they will quickly have to rethink their plans.</p>

		<p>This probably seems like small (Halal?) potatos.<br>
But the first question that springs to mind from reading this story is &#8220;what&rsquo;s next&#8221;?<br>
First we eat their food then we adopt their social mannerisms, religious observations, language and then their system of law?</p>
<p>One of the many flaws of this diversity idea is that the more &#8216;flexible&rsquo; (or tolerant) culture gets to be lead by the more intolerant culture or the group with out solid beliefs gets to be dominated by the group with unshakable beliefs. </p>
<p>So we go from having our own culture, to trying to be inclusive and &#8216;friends&rsquo; to ever other culture, to eventually becoming the culture of the group who we have had to kowtow to the most.<br>
We get to be defined by the weakest link or the lowest common dominator.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re compromising ourselves out of our own culture. No bombs, guns or swords required for this take over, just a subservient demeanour on our part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! Humbug!&#8221; At whatever point we decide to stop this madness, it is inevitable that we&rsquo;re going to be called haters (or worse) anyway, so why not sooner rather than later?<br>

		<p>Living in SE Asia, I eat a lot of pre-packaged Indian Food, I don&rsquo;t like the local food. I tried the cans of Pakistani food, because it is similar to Northern Indian cuisine. However, they are stamped Halal and I thought nothing of it. However, these cans are too spicy for me, so I stick to the Indian made ones. Point of my story - in this case Halal means awful, I have no idea if this is the case for other cuisines.</p>

		<p>Refusing to eat the meal accomplishes nothing.  You&rsquo;ve already payed for it as part of your airline ticket.  The BA policy, if adopted, will surely attract more muslims to fly BA.  How is that advancing security, I wonder?  Attracting more muslims increases the chance that one of them will more often be somebody with a bomb stuffed down their shorts.  I rarely fly.  I&rsquo;d rather drive anywhere in the US than fly, and allow enough time to do so, seeing the country along the way.  If I have to fly internationally, I choose the airline based on security, all other factors weighing less that that.  Hence, I fly El Al.</p>
<p>At least I know there will be NO muslims on the plane, and if there is the odd two or three, they have been scrutinized very, very thoroughly.  Bottom line, I&rsquo;d rather eat Kosher than Halal and know I am very, very safe.  Did you know that ALL El Al planes have electronic counter measures and flare dispensers?  You will NEVER see an old, white grandmother in a wheel chair hassled by El Al security checks as you do in all American airports.  The El Al security is actually checking for threats, not adopting PC standards.  They check where you&rsquo;ve been, they check body language and what they see in your eyes, and various other questions and signs I won&rsquo;t mention.  If you are an ARAB or middle eastern, or have ever been to a muslim country, you get much tighter scrutiny and get pulled out of line.  And they DON&rsquo;T CARE if you don&rsquo;t like it - resistance or anger merely heightens their scrutiny.  Going El Al from American soil shows the glaring difference in REAL security and the bogus white person hassling/pass on through sir (if Arab, black or muslim) idiocy we call security.  Go through ours, then you go through another layer when you hit the El Al counter.  They have their own security even if you&rsquo;ve gone through American security.  And it&rsquo;s security that means something and is targeted against likely threats.  By the way, never will you see a black or muslim as one of the security personnel.  They are all Jewish, most are of an organization I won&rsquo;t name, and they&rsquo;ve already run your ID through their sophisticated databases including photo.  We swipe the embedded chip.  They swipe the entire passport including photo.  I feel very safe flying El Al, and their attendants themselves are security personnel - the women are all cute, too.  Not some stocky lesbian PC hire, or some effeminate guy.  Nor some 45 year old pregnant wife.  But this was about food, wasn&rsquo;t it?  Good food, generally, also.  No pork though.  I&rsquo;ll take filet mignon over a pork chop any day.<br>

		<p><i>Mr Dubois said the plans were not driven by social or religious considerations, but simply by cost.</i></p>
<p><i>He said: &lsquo;If I produce everything according to halal standards, I will reduce complexity and increase cost effectiveness.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I actually believe him when he says it&rsquo;s purely a business decision. And what&rsquo;s wrong with that? It&rsquo;s a private company and it&rsquo;s their decision to make. And the situation that made it a good business decision is NOT that company&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s fault is it? Well, it&rsquo;s the government&rsquo;s fault which allowed so many moslems to immigrate. And it&rsquo;s the people&rsquo;s fault for allowing the government to get away with it. And it will also be the passenger&rsquo;s fault if they don&rsquo;t demand <i>non halal</i> meals on their flights.</p>
<p>I would, however, disagree with the idea of refusing to eat the meal. Airlines don&rsquo;t care if you eat the meal or not. In fact, not eating it just saves them the cost of the food. The only thing they care about is whether you buy the ticket. And, really, what&rsquo;s your alternative??? &#8220;carriers such as Emirates, of Dubai, and Etihad, of Abu Dhabi, which require all meals to be halal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I like the situation. After all, who wants their food &#8220;blessed&#8221; by the ministers of a foreign cult. But everything you eat is ALREADY blessed by the ministers of a foreign cult. So now the food will just be stamped (H) as well as (U) and (K). Personally, I think it would be easier to get food companies to add (JC) to the list than to get them to take the others off. But just for giggles I wish the atheists would get together and make the food companies stamp it with an (A). </p>

		<p>Actually, Halal food is just fine, as anyone who has eaten in decent Middle Eastern hotels and restaurants will agree.</p>
<p>The real issue here is hidden: the implied requirement that as many immigrant Muslims as possible are put on the payroll in countries like Britain, France, Holland and so on.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t recall when airlines have ever served pork. Probably never. At least since 9/11, it&rsquo;s been &#8220;chicken or beef&#8221;, or more lately it&rsquo;s &#8220;chicken or pasta&#8221;.  Those are safe and won&rsquo;t even offend Hindus (I guess). But you always had some choice: either or. Flights to Japan have served eel (I thought they said veal).  But recently, I flew Finnair  (very streamlind service) and they had only one thing: chicken.  Take it or leave it. I&rsquo;m sure that makes it a lot easier for them. </p>
<p>I wonder if these meals are hallal?  Probably, especially if they are prepared by a huge &#8220;catering giant, serving airlines across the globe&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s just more efficient that way.  And as long as nobody else complains, they&rsquo;ll service the Muslims first, because Muslims are demanding and fussy while others aren&rsquo;t.  But I&rsquo;ll bet that even if you asked, the flight attendendants wouldn&rsquo;t know. They just serve the meal. They don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s fixed.</p>

		<p>This could get complicated, depending on how far you want to take it. It could affect who is hired to prepare the food.</p>
<p>As I recall, though I forget the details, Moslems can eat food prepared by Christians but not by Jews. Or perhaps it is the reverse. And (strict)  Jews cannot eat food prepared by anyone who is not circumcised. So I have read. Are you going to start hiring  (or firing) people on the basis of these above criteria?<br>
Where will it all end? </p>
<p>By the way, I am not aware that the Oriental religions are so obsessive about their food and who prepared it.  Why is it just these desert religions?</p>
