<h1>A City at War with Itself: Chicago  &mdash;  Fast Tracking to Anarchy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Andrews, Adventures of a Highway Road Runner (blog), July 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Everyone in Chicago knows it. Almost everyone in America knows it. In fact, a lot of people throughout the world know. Chicago is a city at war with itself  &mdash;  fast tracking to anarchy.</p>
<p>Leading us there have been two major root causes  &mdash;  public violence and public corruption. While Chicago has been under attack with its people fearful and hiding, its police department was twisted into paralysis by organizational decimation, incompetent leadership, self-serving politics and corruption.</p>
<p>After three dead cops in less than 60 days, the men and women of the Chicago Police Department are saying, &#8220;Enough!!!&#8221; We are sickened that our world-class police department has deteriorated into ruin in only a few short years. We are tired of a leaderless department. We are angry at an unsupportive mayor.</p>
<p>We must rise up together to take this city back from the thugs, gangs and rogues that infect our city. The good people of Chicago must also take a stand against the corrupt politicians and their cronies that have bled our city and police department dry.</p>
<p>We must not be stopped. We will not be deterred. We will not be corrupted. Our mission is clear. We must return Chicago to its peaceful, law-abiding citizens. We cannot fail!</p>
<p><b>Public Violence</b></p>
<p>Homicides, shootings and gang related crimes are sucking the life out of this city. Daily, people are shot and killed on our streets over conflicts with gangs and drugs. Our children are not immune from the victimization as they too are targets or suffer as collateral damage from stray gunfire.</p>
<p>Most horrific for Chicago is that in less than 60 days, Chicago has lost 3 of its police officers, killed by gunfire as victims of robberies. It seems no one is safe in our city anymore.</p>
<p>Chicago&rsquo;s homicide rate this year currently stands toe-to-toe with the total number of military forces killed in both Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>Thugs, gangs and renegade groups run the streets and neighborhoods, intimidating and victimizing the decent citizens of this city. They go mostly unchallenged and unchecked by a totally demoralized police force that is dangerously understaffed and still out-gunned on the streets.</p>
<p><b>Public Corruption</b></p>
<p>The continued participation in public corruption activities appears to be much more important to Chicago&rsquo;s power elite than addressing the public safety dilemmas of its citizens.</p>
<p>While public corruption has always been a problem in Chicago, it seems to have become more overt than ever. It is amazing how politicians and the &#8220;connected ones&#8221; can act so openly now and with such impunity.</p>
<p><b>Political Corruption within the Police Department</b></p>
<p>A recent example of alleged political corruption ties to top tier leadership in the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<p>While Superintendent Jody Weis recently appointed Lieutenant Anthony Carothers to Commander of the Englewood District, his appointment has been received by the rank &amp; file with utter disdain. They and some city residents call the appointment of Carothers a true lack of ethical consideration by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the newly appointed Commander Anthony Carothers is the brother of Isaac Carothers, the Chicago Alderman recently convicted on charges of public corruption in Federal Court. Ironically, their father, William Carothers, also served as a Chicago Alderman until his conviction on public corruption charges in 1983.</p>
<p>A simple Google search of Anthony Carothers revealed a Federal Court civil action judgment that was entered against him in 1985. Then a Cook County Deputy Sheriff, Anthony acted in concert with his brother Isaac, in activities of intimidation, physical violence and abuses of authority against Arthur Turner, who was campaigning against their imprisoned father&rsquo;s aide for Alderman.</p>
<p><b>Clout Rules Supreme</b></p>
<p>Anthony Carothers has reportedly never been promoted by competitive examination score to the ranks of sergeant or lieutenant in the CPD. Instead, those ranks were given to him as &#8220;meritorious appointments.&#8221; Promotions, along with a career full of prestigious assignments, flowed freely while his brother Isaac served as the powerful chairman of the Chicago City Council Committee on Police and Fire.</p>
<p>Carothers is just one the numerous political aristocracies this city and this police department has been forced to endure. The incompetent political hacks that have been positioned to lead us have only poisoned us as a department. They are an embarrassment to be associated with the many honorable men and women of the Chicago Police Department who serve its citizens daily with dignity and distinction. His story is here only because it is the newest. There are others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. many others.</p>
<p><b>Police Superintendent Within the Circle of Corruption?</b></p>
<p>Yet, in the first set of command staff changes at CPD after the conviction of Alderman Isaac Carothers, we see the gravy train has not stopped for his brother Anthony.</p>
<p>Superintendent Jody Weis promoted the convicted Alderman&rsquo;s brother to Commander of the Englewood District and then publicly boasted that once again he was promoting the &#8220;brightest and best&#8221; in the Chicago Police Department?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Paralysis within the Police Department</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Based on the above and other contributing factors, the rank and file of the Chicago Police Department do not have confidence in their leadership. They perceive a number of current &#8220;bosses&#8221; as incompetent, politically corrupt, or both  &mdash;  beginning with the mayor and police superintendent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fatal Flaws: Lost From the Beginning</b></p>
<p>When incoming Superintendent Jody Weis arrived on the scene in Chicago, the CPD was already suffering from very low morale, most notably from the Special Operations Section (SOS) and Abatte scandals that were highlighted repeatedly in the mass media. The hard working and honest police officers of this city were being unfairly painted with the broad brush of these two issues. With public perception of the CPD at a very low point, it made the job of serving as a Chicago police officer even harder.</p>
<p>Weis, a career FBI agent, never had experience as a police officer or in managing a local law enforcement agency  &mdash;  let alone the #2 police department in the United States. His earliest decisions and actions would mark his tenure as an unrecoverable failure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Lost Public Confidence in Public Safety = National Guard</b></p>
<p>Citizens have seen and felt the reduced police presence in their neighborhoods, along with the resulting epidemic rises of violent crime.</p>
<p>Frustrated and scared, they and some Illinois lawmakers have been calling for deployment of the army national guard on the streets of Chicago to help restore order, as the public is losing confidence in the capability of the Chicago Police Department to do so.</p>
<p>While the mayor has so far rejected such a need, weary and understaffed police officers and supervisors, working the midnight watch in many police districts are seeing things differently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Taking the High Road</b></p>
<p>We must remain focused on the mission and our purpose. We have taken a solumn oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Illinois. As law enforcers, we operate within the law.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of the crime alluded to in this article happens in the Chicago south-side, the very same place that Obama conducted his &#8220;community-organizing&#8221; for 20 years.  </p>
<p>Ask yourself: how well did Obama&rsquo;s ideas work out in Chicago?  Were the hundreds of millions of taxpayer Dollars that he helped distribute improve the Chicago south side, or did they make things worse?</p>
<p>If Obama did such a horrible job in Chicago, then why did Americans vote for him?  Do you think that his ideas (which failed in Chicago) working for America and the World at-large?  </p>

		<p>Dixieland is dotted with &#8220;national&#8221; cemeteries full of graves holding the dust of White federal soldiers from Illinois who never made it home from their war against us to defend liberty and free our slaves.</p>
<p>What would they say now? Was dying for the sake of the African&rsquo;s liberty worthwhile, especially now that we know the Africans can&rsquo;t help themselves from turning Illinois&rsquo; best cities into African ghettos?</p>
<p>How many White descendants of these dead White Illinois soldiers have been robbed, raped, and murdered by the noble, oppressed, marginalized, and worst of all, misunderstood African?</p>
<p>How many Whites in Chicago are made miserable and endangered by Affirmative Action, the Diversity Curse, and Inclusive Tolerance?</p>
<p>Too bad Illinois didn&rsquo;t take the clue from our necessity of Jim Crow segregation. They actually welcomed thousands of Africans during the migration away from the hateful, raciss South.</p>
<p>But the South sure does appreciate Illinois for taking our excess supply of Africans off our hands.  Our rate of rape, robbery, and murder would have been much higher but for the humanitarians in Chicago who just couldn&rsquo;t surround themselves with enough Africans to make good on the sacrifice of dear old great grand pappy who wore the blue and fought for the success of Lincoln&rsquo;s Liberty.</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity- Embrace Whiteness- Beware and Prepare!</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s coming next. How will you warn your White children?<br>

		<p>This article, while truthful, dances around the most important truth, that being race.  Many big cities are corrupt.  In many big cities, you need clout or steam to get ahead.  Many big city PDs have Police Chiefs who have no business being Police Chiefs.  Big cities, even if they&rsquo;re 100% white big cities, (no such thing anymore), still seem to lend themselves to corruption and clout politics, relative to other 100% white areas.  That&rsquo;s just the nature of big cities.  Hence the old phrase, &#8220;tis life in the big city.&#8221;  </p>
<p>What makes Chicago so bad is that it&rsquo;s the biggest city in the state that deifies Abraham Lincoln and the creed of racial equality he&rsquo;s known for.  For some reason, Chicago has been a magnet for blacks for a very long time, since at least after WWI.  There was something about Chicago in about 1920 that meant that blacks, who were no longer needed for farm labor in the South due to affordable mechanization of farms, wanted to go there.  Between the World Wars, Mississippi-to-Chicago trains were just packed with black migrants.  Even today, even blacks in and around St. Louis make Chicago out to be some sort of land of milk and honey, and go there as often as they could, and would live there and move there if they could.  </p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not corruption or clout which are Chicago&rsquo;s biggest problems, it&rsquo;s the fact that about 1,200,000 black people live there.  When it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s not necessarily the *percentage* that&rsquo;s the big problem, it&rsquo;s the raw number.  People here on AR have posited that theory   &mdash;   They are teachers, and tell us that they would rather teach a school of 200 students that is 90% black and 10% white (180-20 in raw numbers) than a school of 4,000 students that is half-and-half, because 2,000 blacks are much harder to deal with than 180.  St. Louis City is &#8220;blacker&#8221; than Chicago in terms of % (low 50s for STL, mid-30s for Chi), but Chicago&rsquo;s blacks are more problematic than St. Louis&rsquo;s blacks, (1) There&rsquo;s a lot more of them in raw numbers, and (2) Chicago has a long history of pandering to blacks that St. Louis doesn&rsquo;t have   &mdash;   Compared to Chicago, St. Louis is more of a &#8220;southern&#8221; city in sort of a &#8220;southern&#8221; state (hint:  Missouri seceded, but its legitimately elected state government was overthrown by force of Union arms, and had to seek exile in Texas), in the way white cops have historically dealt with black crime.  St. Louis&rsquo;s blacks still have a residual fear of &#8220;the man&#8221; and his police batons, and this kinda sorta serves to keep St. Louis blacks &#8220;in line,&#8221; in relative terms.  Because of Chicago&rsquo;s liberal/pandering race culture, and Illinois&rsquo;s as a whole, Chicago&rsquo;s blacks lost their fear of whites and white police a very long time ago.</p>
<p>When it comes to law enforcement, again, clout and corruption are problems, but the big problem is race.  Blacks can practically do whatever they want and get away with almost anything in Chicago, because they have civil rights in the Land of Lenin.  Heck, that city&rsquo;s lame media treats gang-bangers like credible press spokesmen (see the AR story from last week), and goes so far not only to shove cameras in their faces so they can whine and moan about the few times the CPD actually is allowed to enforce the law and arrest them, but the stupid media there makes the whole ordeal out to be some sort of legitimate &#8220;press conference.&#8221;  So the police can&rsquo;t touch them, save the perps in the most heinous of murders, and as an AR article from a few years ago demonstrates, if you&rsquo;re a white cop in the CPD, every contact with a black suspect is a potential career ender and freedom ender:</p>
<p><a href="/ar/2004/10/index.html#cover" rel="nofollow">/ar/2004/10/index.html#cover</a></p>
<p>As an aside, both the police departments of St. Louis and Kansas City are state controlled.  The Governor appoints all but one of the BOPC members in each city&rsquo;s department (the mayor is ex-officio the other member), and that is an artifact that grew out of Union-Confederate politics in MO I mentioned above.  Just after Missouri&rsquo;s elected government legitimately seceded, it put the Union-heavy PDs of both St. Louis and Kansas City (the latter wasn&rsquo;t that big a deal in 1861) under state control, because the pro-South state government didn&rsquo;t want the PDs of those two big cities acting like de facto informal Union soldiers.  Like I said, real Union soldiers overthrew the elected government, but the new stooge state government they installed didn&rsquo;t lift this rule.  And it stands to this day.  Black activists and various white liberals in both cities want to undo state control, but the labor union-like police officers associations in both cities oppose.  They can&rsquo;t say race, instead, they genuflect to pension control issues.  But race is the real issue   &mdash;   If STL and KC PDs were locally controlled, you&rsquo;d get civilian review boards stocked with cracker jack box theology degree black preachers, you&rsquo;d get no police chases allowed, and you&rsquo;d get everything but an absolute prohibition on white cops arresting black criminal suspects.  Plus affirmative action in hiring and promotion out the yin yang.  Both STL and KC PDs are still relatively sane because not even the kookiest liberal Democrat the state&rsquo;s body politic could produce for a Governor (read:  Mel Carnahan) wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to do something that Dave Bing wants to do in Detroit, and that is, put a convicted murderer on the BOPC.  Carnahan at least had to answer to white rural Missourians and relatively conservative white suburb dwellers in STL and KC for two elections; Bing is a black man who wants and needs only black votes.</p>
<p>Instead of undoing local control in KC and STL, more big city PDs should be put under state control.  It might not help Chicago much, (except if Bill Brady wins Governor in November), but it would help the cause of good law enforcement in big black cities that are in swing and red states.</p>

<p>And why is that &#8220;more horrific&#8221; than the deaths of any other three law-abiding Chicagoans?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Thugs, gangs and renegade groups run the streets and neighborhoods, intimidating and victimizing the decent citizens of this city.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s as close as John Andrews will come to identifying the root of the problem.</p>

A few days later, those gang members had a meeting with Chicago media people to complain that the police were threatening them. Every time innocent children are shot down in gang crossfire, Mayor Daily gets out there and blames the guns, not the people firing them.

<p>Second, Chicago&rsquo;s city officials have been doing everything they can as quietly as they can to shove as many welfare blacks outside the city limits as possible, to shove as much crime outside the city limits as possible, thereby making Chicago the city &#8220;seem&#8221; safer.</p>

		<p>   A quick chicago history lesson. Richard J. Daley used the open housing law to drive lawbiding whites (mostly Roman Catholics) from our city and imported blacks from the south to replace them. Blacks were a dependable voting block for Daley and gave him 90% of the vote. White ethnics wanted honest government and could not be dependant to vote on Daley. <br>
   Open housing was created by Thomas Ayers, father of Bill Ayers, the mad bomber. Michael King, a note plageriser and beater of whores is given too much credit for this.<br>
   Richard Joseph Daley saw that blacks had limitations. In the 70s, the smart blacks all went to Detroit. Detroit offered more opportunity for graft than Chi town. Richard J. imported Mexicans. Mexicans thrive in a corrupt envionment, so they could be counted on to support Daley.<br>
    This is the reason that crime is so bad here. Put Blacks and Mexicans together creates a lot of violence.<br>
    It should be noted that for many years, Chicago has had more murders than New York City. This is not on a by capita basis, this is straigh dead bodies. Remember NYC has twice the population.<br>
     To sum up, Dogs have fleas, Chicagoians have the Daleys.   </p>

		<p>Do I have this right, all three officers were killed off duty, while walking their dog or something, victims of robbery, as the article says?</p>
<p>Were they white, or are their times when race is not the most important thing, and in fact, when asking about race is thought to be racism? Did Chicago pass a law (as the minority population grew large in number) requiring all city workers to live within the Chicago city limits as a job requirement? If so were they &#8216;killed&rsquo; by this &#8216;job requirement&rsquo;. If may seem strange to say the officers were killed by a job requirement, but after all, we know they weren&rsquo;t killed by blacks or hispanics - because they were white. I bet they were killed by guns, or by the heartless and ignorant conservative thinking running rampant in our society - somewhere - over on Fox news or something. Like the kind of ignorant thinking that existed when the murder and crime rates were exponentially lower than they are now. </p>

		<p>St. Louis City is &ldquo;blacker&rdquo; than Chicago in terms of % (low 50s for STL, mid-30s for Chi), but Chicago&rsquo;s blacks are more problematic than St. Louis&rsquo;s blacks, (1) There&rsquo;s a lot more of them in raw numbers, and (2) Chicago has a long history of pandering to blacks that St. Louis doesn&rsquo;t have  &mdash;  Compared to Chicago, St. Louis is more of a &ldquo;southern&rdquo; city in sort of a &ldquo;southern&rdquo; state (hint: Missouri seceded, but its legitimately elected state government was overthrown by force of Union arms, and had to seek exile in Texas), in the way white cops have historically dealt with black crime. St. Louis&rsquo;s blacks still have a residual fear of &ldquo;the man&rdquo; and his police batons, and this kinda sorta serves to keep St. Louis blacks &ldquo;in line,&rdquo; in relative terms. Because of Chicago&rsquo;s liberal/pandering race culture, and Illinois&rsquo;s as a whole, Chicago&rsquo;s blacks lost their fear of whites and white police a very long time ago.<br>

https://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25<br>
 <br>
According to Neighborhood Scout, St. Louis has a crime index of 1, meaning that 1% of cities in the United States are more dangerous.  In St. Louis there are 19.99 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, and 113.52 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants.<br>

		<p>It is a fact, and this article and many of the comments here attest to it, the US is a black controlled country, just as South Africa, Haiti, Jamaica, and other black majority places are. Blacks run the US. They control the government, the educational system, police departments, cities, and towns. Blacks are twelve percent of the population and we are talking about 6 percent of the population, which are black males, they run the show. The jesse jacksons, al sharptons, and the Obamas. Whites just need to get up off of their knees.  </p>

It is the duty of the citizens of Chicago to take responsibility for their actions and know and obey the Constitution.<br>
With the cities absorbtion of illegal aliens, black thugs, and corporate criminals who have exploited the cities deteriorating social apparatus, it is time for Chicago to humble to the truth and make the controversial changes that will restore<br>
the cities order and Christian principle.<br>
The white American citizens of Chicago must exercise their rights to carry fiearms and advocate gun ownership to unarmed citizens deceived by secular humanism and rampant crime.<br>
The city should consider highering undercover agents, bounty hunters, and corporate security, to reduce the costs associated with the deployment of national guard troops,and propagate educational films in public schools and movie theatres to<br>
bring public shame to gangmembers on the street.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, thank you for the excellent analysis in #5!  I&rsquo;ve often wondered what would happen as black-run cities began to utterly implode, and I suppose takeover by state government will be the answer.  Everyone can pretend that race has nothing to do with it.<br>
I often feel like we are in an era somewhat comparable to Radical Reconstruction.  Blacks have now, in a sense, reached the pinnacles of power in getting one of their own elected President.  And Obama is a complete failure, apparently subject to all the weaknesses of blacks in politics.  Americans have hopefully learned the same lesson they did over a century ago.</p>

<p>I hear this all the time and this is a very misleading statistic. Unlike most U.S. cities the &#8216;city&rsquo; of St. Louis does not reside within St. Louis county. They are two separate entities with two separate sets of crime statistics.</p>
<p>The stats which state that STL is the most dangerous only takes into account the crimes reported by the St. Louis City police department and does NOT include crime stats from nearly 80 additional police departments that make up STL county.</p>
<p>If you were to lump them in and average it out like other cities STL drops to around 100th most dangerous city. The STL metropolitan area has approx 2.9 million people with only about 385,000 in the &#8216;city&rsquo;. Over 600,000 residents have fled the city since the late 50&rsquo;s and the relatively small remaining number reflects the awful crime stats that everyone quotes, not St. Louis as a whole. Not even by a longshot.</p>

		<p>24 J.E.:</p>
<p>I partially addressed your concern in 24 in my post 18.  But you miss the point:  I wasn&rsquo;t comparing the entire city of St. Louis vs the entire city of Chicago in post 5, I was comparing Chicago blacks to St. Louis blacks.  Anyone who has been around both will tell you with all honesty that while both are bad, Chicago&rsquo;s blacks are way more arrogant, and have a way bigger sense of entitlement.  Sam Francis once told me that a white man can&rsquo;t even look a D.C. black in the eye without provoking a fight; they&rsquo;re that arrogant and steam-headed, based on the Federal government pandering to them for decades.  </p>
<p>As for MQ&rsquo;s survey, I remember it well.  It came out the day after the Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series, and the very next day, St. Louis beat Detroit again in MQ&rsquo;s survey, as the worst crime city in America, with Detroit finishing in 2nd.  Now, there&rsquo;s no denying St. Louis and its blacks are dangerous.  However, MQ relies on official crime stats, and it has been proven that in some cases, you take official crime stats with a grain of salt.  St. Louis, while not perfect, and while not totally honest, is more honest in its crime stat reporting than most big cities.  And, as an SLPD Sergeant told me frankly about a week after that MQ survey came out, &#8220;c&rsquo;mon.  They&rsquo;re trying to say St. Louis&rsquo;s &#8216;thugs&rsquo; are worse than Detroit&rsquo;s and Chicago&rsquo;s?  Use your head and your common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, after that MQ survey came out, the Mayor of St. Louis first dumped all over MQ&rsquo;s methodology (which, as I said, isn&rsquo;t MQ&rsquo;s problem, it&rsquo;s that St. Louis is actually close to honest).  Then he changed tactics   &mdash;   he said that MQ was right, St. Louis was that bad, but that meant that we had to go out and pass a sales tax increase to fund new and renovated recreation centers to give St. Louis&rsquo;s many black thugs something to do, other than that which made St. Louis more dangerous.  (Not so coincidentally, where there is construction in the City of St. Louis, there is the Syrian-Lebanese mob, the current mayor, surname Slay, is merely a pretty-faced front for their outward consumption).  So city voters passed it, and it did indeed go to fund two new rec centers, and renovate existing ones.  The first new one to open was in St. Louis&rsquo;s far southern end, in an near lily-white neighborhood, (in fact, in St. Louis&rsquo;s only aldermanic district held by a Republican).  The city built the rec center, but essentially gave it to the YMCA to replace their nearby aging building.  And their membership rates are only slightly lower for city residents.  (Big whoop)  I wrote a dead tree and ink registered letter to the Mayor, asking him how that would preclude as much as one violent crime in St. Louis&rsquo;s southern half.  He never responded.  Strangely enough, while Slay said it was really that bad, he was still saying that it wasn&rsquo;t that bad and MQ was wrong.  Slay was speaking out of both sides of his mouth, though this was not a surprise, b/c this was just two years after he not only endorsed John Kerry for President, another two-faced double-talker, but was also the co-chairman of Kerry&rsquo;s finance committee.</p>
<p>One more thing:  Slay, like Richard Daley in Chicago, both have very quiet policies of moving as many blacks outside the city limits as possible, thereby reducing the crime rates inside their cities proper.</p>

		<p>I live in Chicago on the South Side, on the Lake - in the University of Chicago community that Barack and Michele Obama moved in to as the base of their operation. The Black Nation of Islam leaders also live here - it&rsquo;s a good place to base such operations - in a prosperous, 50% plus White neighborhood where Blacks and Whites get together to keep out the poor Blacks that surround us on 3 sides, well now more like 2 1/2 as the Lakefront area between us and Downtown gets fixed up, gentrified - being on the Lake generally means being well above the bad areas.</p>
<p>Chicago feels about the same, a bit better with crime, race relations of any time in my life here born early 60s. Crime is constant, but generally not unexpected if you know the score. There is less of a feel that Blacks will riot, make threats to get what they want - most everyone including Blacks see poor Blacks as the problem that needs to be helped, changed. Just about everyone including most Blacks wants to ship out our Black criminals, low lives to some other state, city, continent. </p>
<p>White Mayor Daley II is stepping down, so there will be political anarchy, power plays with strong racial components. The macher gangster Rahm Emanuel apparently wants to be our mayor.</p>

		<p>We need to study all of the cities that have drastically declined in recent decades and see if there is a common denominator which caused them to crumble. <br>
Just today I looked at dozens of pictures of the destroyed sections of Luanda, Detroit, Monrovia, Chicago, Port-au-Prince, Cleveland, Mogadishu, Philadelphia, Kigali and East St.Louis and the only thing I found that these places have in common is signs advertising Coca Cola. Could it be that the beverage producing giant is behind all of the carnage and destruction? Is there something in those bottles and cans that caused the people in the pictures to devolve into uncivilized, ungovernable, ineducable people who destroy the cities in which they live and murder and maim human beings and each other with neither reason nor remorse? <br>
The evidence against Coke is strong, but I am not ready to point any fingers yet. I will continue to study the people in the pictures of those devastated cities and try to find additional common denominators that I may have overlooked.</p>

<p>Yesterday, September 7, 2010, Daley announced he wouldn&rsquo;t run for re-election in 2011. The political jockeying has already begun. I anticipate the legal sales of firearms, especially handguns, will escalate, now that the Second Amendment applies in Chicago, as well.</p>
<p>In fact, I think SCOTUS&rsquo; decision in the McDonald case might well have been the final nail in Daley&rsquo;s political coffin. It meant that Chicagoans no longer have to rely on a decimated police force for their personal protection. Daley was ridiculed for his maniacal opposition to Chicagoans legally owning handguns, and then made the laughingstock of the Internet with his &#8220;gun up the butt&#8221; comments at that gun &#8220;buyback&#8221; press conference, prior to SCOTUS&rsquo; ruling in McDonald..</p>
<p>I doubt that the next mayor will enforce the gun ordinance (currently challenged in court) enacted in the wake of the McDonald decision. I surely don&rsquo;t think he or she will get Chicagoans to drink the Kool-Aid of voluntary gun surrendering at their local church or police station. That genie has been let out of the bottle, and no way is it going back in.</p>

The publisher, Robert Abbott, was a Republican, as were many blacks at that time, and he was pleased that blacks were permitted to vote and, sometimes hold elected office in Chicago. </p>
