<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/education/14suspend.html?_r=2">Racial Disparity in School Suspensions</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Dillon, New York Times, September 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In many of the nation&rsquo;s middle schools, black boys were nearly three times as likely to be suspended as white boys, according to a new study, which also found that black girls were suspended at four times the rate of white girls.</p>
<p>School authorities also suspended Hispanic and American Indian middle school students at higher rates than white students, though not at such disproportionate rates as for black children, the study found. Asian students were less likely to be suspended than whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, &#8220;Suspended Education: Urban Middle Schools in Crisis,&#8221; was published by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit civil rights organization.</p>

		<p>Did the SPLC adjust for the type of violation committed?  A more serious violation actually requires suspension, while mid-range violations could go either way, between suspension and some lesser punishment.  It just might be that blacks tend to the more serious violations.</p>
<p>Did they also consider that many schools, in their never-ending fear of the R-word, falsely blame white students as co-equal provocateurs in what are really black-on-white or Hispanic-on-white assaults?</p>

		<p>Good heavens, yet another shocking and totally inexplicable report from the educational system.</p>
<p>Curiously, this seems consistent with the disturbing reality of gross black overrepresentation throughout the American prison system.</p>
<p>This conspiracy of white and Asian oppression seems to respect no bounds at all. I&rsquo;m shocked, shocked! And shocked yet again!</p>

		<p>Reading over the study, I noticed one glaringly obvious omission: at no point were the teachers asked to explain the disparities.  I think an anonymous survey, among teachers, as to why there are such large race/gender disparities would be in order.  While it would not be very difficult to devise such a survey, I highly doubt that any school district would allow it to be administered if it included an option that stated, &#8220;black kids cause more trouble&#8221;.  Perhaps we could think of a way to administer such a survey outside of school so that no permission would be needed.</p>

		<p>Codes of conduct, discipline, and penalties are racist.</p>
<p>Blacks and mestizos violate these codes and are disciplined at greater rates than Whites, therefore, racism.</p>
<p>For other examples of racism, see: the concept of murder, insurance rates, intelligence, SAT scores, housing values, credit scores, and rates of welfare enrollment.</p>
<p>See?  Most of the indicators of Western morality and virtue, as well as the institutional gatekeepers thereof, are racist.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism in a nutshell.</p>
<p>RACISM is MEANINGLESS.  It is a political tool to shut up, commit violence against, and oppress civilized White people.</p>
<p>Say NO to White genocide, and RIDICULE anyone who calls you racist for opposing the monstrous policies in the US and other White nations.</p>

		<p>The statistics also show many more boys than girls suspended.  No one questions that because all assume boys are more disruptive - it is their nature.  There is a natural difference between boys and girls and stats reinforce the reasonable hypothesis.  What about a natural difference between the races in obeying reasonable rules?  Is it discrimination?  Or nature revealing itself in the statistics?  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

		<p>The rates would be astronomically higher for blacks if teachers weren&rsquo;t so afraid of appearing PREEEEEEJ-dist. A lot of intolerable behavior is simply overlooked because administrators universally blame the teachers for it, because it&rsquo;s just too much trouble to suspend the student, and because there are so damned many of them acting out all at once.</p>

		<p>The SPLC is NON PROFIT????  Bull.  They take in, but it never goes out.  They are one of the biggest rackets going.  They have a bigger racket going that Sharpton, Jackson and Farrakhan combined.  We all know the simple truth.  We&rsquo;ve seen it in our classes, we see it on the streets and we see it in Walmart and in grocery stores.  Blacks are more disruptive by far, cannot and will not follow instructions or rules, have unchecked attitudes, and are often violent or confrontational for no civilized reason.  To the SPLC:  people are waking up to the very real differences between blacks as a race and the civilized white race.  Your racket and your apologetics will soon have no audience.<br>

There is an undeniable link between liberal advocacy groups and the media. These advocacy groups write their &#8216;research&rsquo; and &#8216;findings&rsquo; and give them to news outlets who publish them without review and which then enter the mainstream with legitimacy and as facts.</p>

		<p>While not all black high school students are obnoxious, noisy, defiant and threatening, many are. They prevent all the others from trying or learning. The teachers, favorite targets of both Obama and the Republicans, are hog tied by absurd judicial rulings and liberal school boards from controlling classrooms. Suspensions in black majority schools are the only thing that provide a bit of peace for a few days at least. As for expulsions, which are warranted for thousands of black &#8220;young adults&#8221;, forget it. The ACLU and cowardly school boards ignore the recommendations of even black principals that thugs need to be kicked out for the safety of students and teachers of all backgrounds. Some of the most prosuspension and proexpulsion teachers I know are black or foreign born. This nonsense is only tolerated in the USA,and this chaos precedes Obama.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to think of any other people or organizations that are allowed to present ideas in an unchallenged and unaccountable way. Even supreme court judges get criticized though they have lifetime jobs. Lower level judges sometimes run for election and are evaluated for promotion to higher level courts. University professors have their writings peer reviewed and are rated by course evaluations. Politicians run for election. Newspapers and TV face competition and consumer choice. And then there&rsquo;s the SPLC which is above it all, it seems. Its credentials are not reviewed. It never has to debate with challengers. The internal workings of the organization are hidden. There are no demands that it address other controversies to check for consistency. There is no competition from other organizations. It&rsquo;s amazing that the SPLC has been allowed to get away with this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;School authorities also suspended Hispanic and American Indian middle school students at higher rates than white students, though not at such disproportionate rates as for black children,&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of these suspension probably involve &#8220;fights&#8221;, what they call them. A Bantu attacks a white student in a &#8220;fight&#8221; and beats the white kid nearly to death or causes very bad bodily  harm of some sort.</p>
<p>Or the &#8220;fight&#8221; is of an unprovoked nature, and there is a disparity of size between the &#8220;combatants&#8221;.</p>
<p>By middle school, as opposed to early grammar schoo&rsquo;, the Bantu kid is bigger and stronger, having matured earlier and more so when maturing.</p>
<p>These &#8220;fights&#8221; are not of an equal nature.</p>

		<p>An abbreviated version of this article appeared today in my local newspaper, probably because my county borders Palm Beach county and its middle schools has the highest number of black males suspended - more than half of the black males in middle schools in this county in 2006 were suspended at least once, about 53 percent, compared to a greatly reduced percentage of white males.</p>
<p>This was one of the worst counties out of the 18 large urban areas studied.</p>
<p>This is not a surprise to anyone who lives in south FL. As a white woman living here I try to avoid these groups of so-called &#8220;students&#8221; like the plague. Along with the sorry adults in their life who carefully teach them this bad behavior and hatred of whites.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have insults shouted at me nor am I harrassed by white students, and very little from Hispanic youths, but I can&rsquo;t say the same for black students. Their ignorance and lack of shame knows no bounds. And if this is how they talk to adults, what do they do to other students? And how many other students who would not act like this on their own copy this behavior? </p>
<p>So this article is not news. Neither is the lame answer from the Palm Bch. Co. school spokesman who said &#8220;even though he disputed these statistics, all data show an unacceptably high number of black students suspended, and the district was using strategies to reduce the suspensions&#8221;.</p>
<p>The usual denial, and since more and more black anti-social behavior cannot be covered up, the generalized lingo of the ineffectuals in charge.</p>
<p>Other than the comedian Bill Cosby, who was demonized by the black community and the clowns who pass for media today, I hear no other black person speaking the truth to the black community.<br>
Which is exactly what Mr. Cosby tried to do: &#8220;Pick yourselves up by the boot straps, straighten out your act, stay in school, leave drugs and booze alone, and quit blaming everyone else for the problems you create for yourselves&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I can think of a few solutions myself:<br>
1. If your child is suspended for a second time, your Section 8 and/or Welfare will be cut, if you&rsquo;re on them.<br>
2. If you are illegals in this country and your child is a habitual problem, you will be deported and/or any aid cut.<br>
3. If your child is a habitual offender he/she will be expelled from the school, and made to attend school in a detention style program.<br>
4. And if the child fails #3., they lose the privilege to attend any school, any where. THEY DO NOT GET TO GRADUATE.</p>
<p>Nothing will change unless blacks take blame for their own actions, which I don&rsquo;t see happening. Just a lot of denial and blame tossing. Aided and abetted by our slanted media coverage.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a problem. If there are more minority students than white students being suspended, just pick out White students at random and suspend them to make up the difference. The same could be said for the asian students. End of problem.</p>

		<p>Black students for decades have been well known to be the most disruptive &amp; unruly and accordingly suspended much more often. Naturally, the NAACP, a black power shake-down organization, gives public schools a lot of grief for this - no one in public school administration dare care for what&rsquo;s best for non-white children - and so many schools institute these awful &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; rules to avoid disparate impact lawsuits.  Too bad non-blacks allow this nonsense and refuse to protect their own - they might be called &#8220;racist&#8221;!</p>

		<p>If they are 8 times more likely to be criminals why is it such a stretch to believe they could be 3 times as likely to be suspended for acting up in school?  When I went to school in the 60s and 70s the black kids were the ones who spent the most time in the principal&rsquo;s office.  The black kids were the ones causing most of the classroom disruptions and most of the fights.  Why would I think it&rsquo;s any different today?  The biggest problem with our educational system is that they believe a Utopian lie is reality.  These are supposed to be learned people and they choose to ignore or overlook the most obvious issue.  Until ANY kid learns self-discipline you won&rsquo;t be able to teach them much of anything else.  That&rsquo;s the reality of it.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how the educators expect any levels of success from a crop of single parent bastards who can&rsquo;t be trusted to sit still and listen for more than a few seconds at a time.  Till they deal with the real problem the secondary problems will persist.  Maybe they really do know all of this and are tolerating the skrew-ups for job security (since their job is not contingent on successful results) or because there&rsquo;s an evil racist plan to keep blacks down by letting them flunk through school.  All the while giving them &#8220;awards&#8221; for obscure, non-academic &#8220;achievements&#8221;.  American educators should be tried under RICO for denying the obvious problem for so many decades.<br>

<p>I think they&rsquo;ve already thought of that.  I get the feeling that if you&rsquo;re white, and you attend a public school with a lot of blacks, or you live in a heavily black area, you better purer than the wife of Caesar and the wind-driven snow combined.  For school officials, cops and prosecutors are looking for any excuse to suspend/charge/prosecute/jail whites, in order to narrow this &#8220;suspension&#8221; or &#8220;punishment&#8221; gap.</p>

		<p>There are obvious and interesting correlative proofs here.  </p>
<p>Black girls exceed white girls 4:1 for suspension rates.</p>
<p>Which may not mean much for behavior because teenage white girls are far from saints but they aren&rsquo;t exactly stupid in covering up their behavioral deficiencies.  Except that black girls, like black boys, have massively higher sex hormone levels, sooner.</p>
<p>Add to this what another poster mentioned about earlier and higher maturation rates and the obvious linkup with testosterone as a &#8216;disruptive&rsquo; sexualizing growth hormone also common in white males but at far lower dosages becomes a big question mark.</p>
<p>Test out a theorem:  Get one hundred students of color groups X/Y/Z, gender XX/YY and average statistical IQ for the race.  </p>
<p>Lower their testosterone levels to white or asian mean equivalents for age through a ghetto lottery program of sex hormone inhibitor administration from 8-9 onwards through highschool.</p>
<p>Then see what happens over a decade as a function of both overall behavioral/achievement levels in school and specifically SAT results and their expected outcomes in college/job markets.</p>
<p>The kids may well be massive success story or a wimpy wreck but they will still be young enough to compensate and with 250,000 dollars of payout for their participation.  Which is where you will find you have no shortage of volunteers.</p>
<p>@16<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
1. If your child is suspended for a second time, your Section 8 and/or Welfare will be cut, if you&rsquo;re on them.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Great, low impulse control psychologies active AND homeless with a family.  I keep getting visuals of some of the get-the-aristo moments from _A Tale Of Two Cities_.  Oh well, let them eat cake I guess.  Or&hellip; why not interdict huge/early family growth by giving &#8216;first timer&rsquo; Welfare/S8 entrants a requirement for sterilization to get in to begin with?  At least after the first kid.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
2. If you are illegals in this country and your child is a habitual problem, you will be deported and/or any aid cut.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No.  They shouldn&rsquo;t be here to begin with.  Don&rsquo;t give them an excuse for &#8216;good behavior&rsquo; backdoor amnesty.  For better or for worse, native blacks are American Citizens.  Illegal Mexicans are not.  Do not confuse the two groups.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
3. If your child is a habitual offender he/she will be expelled from the school, and made to attend school in a detention style program.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Been done before, t&rsquo;was called _Segregation_.  Lot of ignorant people bitched and moaned about racism the last time.  It may well help white and high IQ hispanics.  Will do nothing for blacks whose propensity for and extent of misbehavior rises in direct proportion to their total numbers.  If you can get them in the door with a working truancy program to begin with.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
4. And if the child fails #3., they lose the privilege to attend any school, any where. THEY DO NOT GET TO GRADUATE.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I have a feeling 99.9999% of the blacks in the sub-85 IQ range would electively choose this option for you, given a choice.  That&rsquo;s going to be a large percentage of the inner city populations.</p>
<p>So would about 68% of hispanics, though the latter are not as afraid to work in menial labor positions and many leave high school to get a jump on doing exactly that.</p>
<p>The big problem here is accepting that, in a high tech, high IQ, job market, there may well be 60% of society who are NOT capable of ever gaining a level of personal achievement sufficient to meet their perceived commitment threshold to perks-for-pain working status.  Again including whites.</p>
<p>And it will get _worse_ as not just manufacturing and IT/office but also now R&D; are moving offshore in a major way.</p>
<p>You can deal with that reality, by-</p>
<p>1.  In-state deportation, starvation in ghettos <br>
    or outright execution as a function of induced mob <br>
    criminality.  I&rsquo;m _against this_ as negligently induced <br>
    homicide is as evil as direct murder when it comes about as <br>
    a function of willful disregard for obvious outcomes.<br>
2.  Going to high end genomics to fix whatever<br>
    genetic &#8216;differences&rsquo; are keeping certain, non-adaptive, <br>
    subspecies (for such is what race really is) from competing <br>
    in a modern environment so different from that which made <br>
    them unique.  Like it or not, we are staring Darwin right in <br>
    the face people.  It&rsquo;s time we fessed up to that reality.<br>
3.  Going Negative Eugenics to support an open welfare culture <br>
    in trade for dropping sub-par IQ population rates with early <br>
    sterilization.</p>
<p>It is at #3 where you put the &#8220;If you want to have kids, stay in school, and study _hard!_&#8221; choice in front of your typically disruptive black male who is running on 2-3 times the testosterone of a white equivalent.</p>
<p>Because if he chooses, electively, at 13-15, to quit school, he should be chemically castrated.  Along with any other white, hispanic, asian or other individual that decides a welfare existence is for him.</p>
<p>Which is not as dictatorial as it sounds.  Because with build-down of our welfare culture rather than -tear down- of our society to try and find useful work for non-volitional members to partake of, we can provide a fairly decent lifestyle for those who innately know they aren&rsquo;t in it to win it.  And there will be no shame.  Although there will be separation.</p>
<p>To which, let me add one other thing: if you are FINALLY going to admit that these people (IMO, legitimately) don&rsquo;t want to be ditch diggers looking up the Olympians yet have no higher aptitudes to claw their way up to true equality, then you have to admit that, in a society which still needs stoop labor, there has to be a replacement dumb labor force that can be stood up fast and managed intelligently.</p>
<p>And anthropomorphic robotics are the way forwards to that.  </p>
<p>Because a robot can be an agro worker today and 2hrs worth of battery charge, a roads and infrastructure worker, tonight.  Before taking another program download to work in the construction industry tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>24/7/365.</p>
<p>All the while not really understanding life, the universe and the meaning of it&rsquo;s labors as anything more than a localized environmental expert system (see the object, recognize it&rsquo;s status execution logic, complete task) which is driven to the job site.</p>
<p>The solutions are right there people.  They aren&rsquo;t pretty because they force us to admit to our common failings as personalities and as physically limited beings.  But they are WORKABLE if we just accept that the necessary changes to our society have essential synergies that have to accompany them.</p>
<p>Not all of which are bad.</p>

		<p>I have taught black students and latino students for years in different schools in a very large urban area.  </p>
<p>About 20% of the latinos are useless in every sense of the word (gangs, drugs, etc&hellip; and it&rsquo;s mostly dominicans who are like this).  Perhaps 40-50% of the latino students are nice (even sweet in their demeanor) but just plain dumb (low IQ) and the rest are okay by American standards.</p>
<p>But among the many black kids I have taught (with great dedication and at least temporary success), the overwhelming majority are just plain messed up in so many ways, and it was caused by other blacks and their negative culture.</p>
<p>Nearly all of my black students NEVER come into contact with any white people save for teachers and the occasional cop.  All the local gov&rsquo;t reps are black, the admins are all black, all the stores are owned by blacks, etc.  Can&rsquo;t blame whitey here.</p>
<p>The black boys have very little in the way of morals, most have no morals at all!  They are prone to willful, brash behavior and have little respect for any boundaries.  Most of my students professed a love of gangs and the desirability of drug-dealing as a career.  Most of the girls were jaded and loud.</p>

		<p>From JewAmongYou:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I noticed one glaringly obvious omission: at no point were the teachers asked to explain the disparities. I think an anonymous survey, among teachers, as to why there are such large race/gender disparities would be in order&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing that.  Would that more people understood how frustrating this situation is for us teachers.</p>
<p>Whenever test scores show an &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo; (which is always, ever and everywhere) at no time are teachers asked why this is so.</p>
<p>Instead, because schools are dinged for not testing all of their students, there is an all-out, crazed effort to round up every miscreant and absentee student possible  &mdash;  including going to kids&rsquo; homes to fetch them specifically for testing.</p>
<p>That alone causes test scores to drop.</p>
<p>Kids that I haven&rsquo;t seen for months are sitting in my room taking a high-stakes test with my name on it, kids that &#8216;cut-up&rsquo; all year, are disinterested in education, refuse to do assignments/homework, are six grade levels behind (which is hardly the current teacher&rsquo;s fault) also take this same test with my name at the top.</p>
<p>Yet when the test scores come out, and they&rsquo;re &#8216;not what is expected&rsquo; who is interviewed for the news media?  Students. Parents. Administrators.  Never Teachers.  Students and parents who are happy to rip apart teachers, call us racist, not caring, not sympathetic to their needs, not teaching them or their children.</p>
<p>We have no voice.  Yet these test scores will be used to evaluate me as to whether I should be fired or not or receive a bonus or raise.</p>
<p>When this goes into effect, I expect test scores to suddenly rise dramatically as teachers make sure their students do well on these tests by any means possible.</p>
<p>As for suspensions:  Schools are under huge, tremendous amounts of pressure NOT to suspend &#8216;students of color&rsquo;, especially blacks.  For a black to be suspended, he must commit some type of major felony, all else is ignored.  To make up for and even out the black suspension gap, Whites and/or hispanics are suspended for minor infractions.</p>
<p>If there were any justice in the universe, potok and dees would be forced to spend a year in a black school, receive nothing but a typical teachers salary  &mdash;  based on their students&rsquo; test scores, of course, and with the inability to suspend students, even when they threaten your life in the most vile manner.   I suspect neither would last past the first period  &mdash;  I also suspect neither would change his mind about egalitarian ideals.  </p>
<p>That might threaten their money train  &mdash;  based on bashing Whites and scaring their donors into believing that without the SPLC, the Fourth Reich will rise and march in the streets.</p>

		<p>The radical leftwing SPLC uses the data to propagandise their hatred of Whites instead of congratulating the White students for behaving themselves. Also, the loony left could have focused on the disparity of male to female suspensions but can&rsquo;t help themselves to only display their negativity toward Whites.</p>

<p>LOL.  And no kidding.  They also profess a love of misogynistic, hate-Whitey &#8216;music&rsquo; if it can be called that and look up to thug-style rap stars as role models.</p>
<p>Many of the boys believe they are going to be stars in the NBA.</p>
<p>Black former talk-show host Larry Elder writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Northeastern University Center for the Study of Sport in Society found that, of black teens, 66 percent believe they will ultimately play pro ball, twice the percentage of whites who see themselves becoming pros. More disturbingly, black parents are four times more likely than white parents to believe that their children will become professional athletes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Sports sociology professor Gary Sailes of Indiana University, according to Emerge, says that &#8216;52 percent of blacks playing college basketball think &#8216;they will make pro,&rsquo; yet only &#8216;2.5 percent will play in the NBA for at least one year&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You can be sure when they don&rsquo;t make the NBA (or college or high school) cut, there&rsquo;ll be every excuse imaginable, not their own shortcomings.  Ditto for scholastic ability  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s always the teachers&rsquo;/schools&rsquo;/White oppressors&rsquo; fault, never their own  &mdash;  and this is fortified by the media and academia both of which continue to promote black infallibility.  Gimme a Break.</p>
<p>As for the girls, when they tire of school, by about the 8th grade (or sooner), they&rsquo;ll opt out of &#8216;The System&rsquo; by getting pregnant making &#8216;Welfare Mother&rsquo; their permanent, life-long career.  Repeat each generation ad infinitum. </p>

		<p>Those who point out that blacks are more likely to be punished than whites usually expect whites to be ashamed.  Blacks should be ashamed.  If they behaved as well as whites their punishment rate would be equal to the white rate.   <br>
 <br>
Blacks do not behave and perform poorly because of racial prejudice.  Racial prejudice persists because blacks behave and perform poorly. Qualities that had survival value in the African jungle deserve to be punished in civilized countries.  <br>
 <br>
Everyone knows this, but it is dangerous to say so publically.   </p>
