			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Barnes, Washington Post, September 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made it sound so simple that day in 2007, when he and four other members of the Supreme Court declared that this city&rsquo;s efforts to desegregate its schools violated the Constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race,&#8221; Roberts wrote, &#8220;is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>But life has been anything but simple for school officials here. They have steadfastly  &mdash;  or stubbornly, depending on the point of view  &mdash;  tried to maintain integrated classrooms despite the court&rsquo;s command that officials not consider race when assigning children to schools.</p>
<p>Consultants were hired, lawyers retained, census data scrubbed, boundaries redrawn, more buses bought, more routes proposed, new school choices offered and more lawsuits defended.</p>
<p>The final product, which integrates schools based on socioeconomic factors rather than on race alone, has proven to be more complex and costly than the previous system. Long bus rides and complaints from a vocal minority of parents have threatened popular support of the plan. The school board has delayed full implementation. The legislature is contemplating whether to guarantee parents a spot in their neighborhood schools.</p>
<p>It has been a long three years for school officials since the court for the first time took away the simplest and most efficient way to integrate classrooms: making decisions based upon a student&rsquo;s race. It was a landmark moment for a court that has long struggled with race-conscious decisions by government: when they are warranted, and when they have outlived their usefulness.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The decision&rsquo;s impact</b></p>
<p>The impact of the decision, which directly involved schools here and in Seattle and set rules for school boards across the nation, already has been noteworthy. Seattle has mostly abandoned efforts to force diverse classrooms; it has returned to a system of neighborhood schools augmented by magnet schools and new educational programs scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Louisville, along with a number of other like-minded systems across the country, is betting that using socioeconomic factors, not just race, will help maintain diverse schools and meet the Supreme Court&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>Those who have battled the school system here say it is nothing more than an end run around the court&rsquo;s decision, a misguided experiment by school officials who should be focused on the bigger goal of improving education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But school Superintendent Sheldon Berman, who started his job days after the 2007 Supreme Court decision, said he is convinced that a school system cannot be successful for all children without diverse classrooms. If Louisville&rsquo;s plan is more costly and complex, he said, it is because of a flawed and doctrinaire court decision that ignored the consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&rsquo;re going to create a vital democracy, and see our schools as the seeds of that democracy, we need schools that maintain diversity,&#8221; Berman said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A new look at race</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Louisville&rsquo;s case was particularly striking. From 1975 to 2000, the system was under a federal court order to desegregate its schools. When the court decided that had been accomplished, school officials voluntarily continued with the race-conscious plans so that the progress made would not be lost.</p>
<p>It was a point of civic pride to make sure that the combined city and county schools not be seen as segregated, said John K. Bush, a Louisville lawyer who filed a brief with the court on behalf of Mayor Jerry Abramson and Greater Louisville Inc., the city&rsquo;s chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty years of experience since Brown v. Board of Education should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution,&#8221; he [Justice Anthony M. Kennedy] wrote.</p>
<p>Schools had a compelling interest in promoting diversity, he said. &#8220;Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered,&#8221; Kennedy said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>An alternate approach</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of school systems using socioeconomic factors to assign students has grown from a handful to about 80 in the past decade, Kahlenberg [Century Foundation&rsquo;s Richard D. Kahlenberg] said, serving nearly 4.2 million schoolchildren. And the Obama administration&rsquo;s Education Department has signaled interest in such methods, giving small grants to systems looking to develop diversity programs that comply with the court&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Louisville&rsquo;s new plan splits the county into two geographic districts  &mdash;  one having higher concentrations of minorities, lower incomes and less educational attainment  &mdash;  and requires each school in the district to have a mix of students from both.</p>
<p>Parents choose four to six schools as possibilities for their children, but about 20 percent do not receive their first or second choices. That has led to two unsuccessful lawsuits and plenty of angry parents.</p>

<p>I would venture there is absolutely no documented substantiation for these positions on the importance of &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the school systems (or anywhere else for that matter).  However, these well educated people repeat these pop sociological soundbites about diversity as if they were as proven as the law of gravity.  Furthermore, these soundbites become manifest as law and regulation disrupting and harming children&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>So the question arises; are these aforementioned well educated people not capable of critical thinking and analysis?  And if many leaders in our society do not have these attributes where does that leave us as a nation?<br>

		<p>This is why I, as a NJ resident, am against consolidating our 570 local school districts into 21 county districts.  A county-wide school district means no one can escape the horrors of the inner-city &#8220;chi-drins&#8221;.  In fact, if it were not for the NJ Socialist (ooops I mean supreme) Court there would be even more school districts.  Why?  School districts, back in a more rural, less populated and whiter time, that shared some services, usually a high school, and are now big enough to support a full K-12 system, are not allowed to pull out of the regional district because the &#8220;racial balance would be upset.  Examples of districts have tried are Branchburg which can not divorce Somerville, Greenwich which is in an unhappy marriage with Paulsboro and the Englewoods, a sad story if there ever was one.</p>
<p>County-wide districts mean every child in Essex County would have to go to school with the thugs from Newark and East Orange.  Kids in Cherry Hill would be robbed by kids from Camden.  Trenton would infect Hamilton.  County-wide school systems mean only one thing: a boon to the bus companies.  I walked to school.  My kids get driven to catholic school while I pay to educate the inner city scholars.  Kentucky needs to have local school districts.  The closer government is to the people, including Boards of Education, the more likely people are to get the government they deserve rather than the government imposed from on high.<br>

They demand access to better (white) schools and they fail.</p>
<p>They demand their own black teachers, black administrators, black principals, black curriculum programs, black school boards and they fail.</p>

<p>How, exactly, is diversity a necessity for democracy?</p>
<p>Anyway, beign a child in an integrated school district sounds like a lot of un-necessary work, and I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone would put their children through the bussing, confusion, and changes all the time.</p>
<p>In my school district, we don&rsquo;t have any form of integration, you go to whatever school your neighborhood is zoned for. You can, however, attend the school of your choice if you have good grades. But, then again there wouldn&rsquo;t be any reason for integration here, because the schools are already REALLY diverse. I mean there are all sorts of people whose race you can&rsquo;t even identify. And each race is fairly well-represented in our middle and high schools.</p>

		<p>The solution is simple: Let the Black kids go to the schools that are paid for by their parents&rsquo; or slumlords&rsquo; property taxes and let the White kids go to the schools that are paid for by their parents&rsquo;taxes.  </p>
<p>The whole point of school integration was to put Black students on the same achievement level as White students. I don&rsquo;t believe that even the likes of pioneering social-engineering schemer Hubert Humphrey thought that the way to reach that goal was to lower the achievement level of the Whites, but that has been the result. We burned up a billions of gallons of bus fuel to try to make Blacks get better grades and all we have to show for it is a bunch of White boys who wear their pants way down low. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to forget about all of the well-intended social  experiments and get back to educating the children of the historical majority. They will need a thorough education if they are to stand a chance at digging themselves out of the hole that we allowed our leaders to throw them in. </p>

		<p>This thing never goes away. They will be fighting this until the end of days. Once the lawyers and the judges and the special school masters start making a buck then it&rsquo;s over. I live in LR, AR. and the mess that has been created with busing, charter schools, magnet schools, private schools is never ending. All that happens is that a select group of politicos and so called experts start getting inflated salaries and time payments. </p>
<p>This racket has only cost white americans who have lost their children&rsquo;s right to a public education and must sacrifice time and money in home or private schools. No wonder women work, no wonder people aren&rsquo;t saving money. Without revolution we will die. God help us all. </p>

		<p>A predominately black school is a dangerous place where little learning occurs.  That is why responsible black parents want their children to attend predominately white schools.  It is why white parents shrink from the approach of the children of those responsible black parents.  <br>
 <br>
Even white liberals are reluctant to have their children go to predominately black schools.  <br>
 <br>
When blacks are in the minority most try to behave.  When they are in the majority, most behave the way they want to behave.  </p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And what do &#8216;market focus groups&rsquo; study demographics for eh?</p>
<p>Kaching.  That&rsquo;$ right.  Whites get the goodies and blacks/hispanics fear being excluded from a country-within-a-country free ride.</p>
<p>The irony of this is that, &#8216;back in the day&rsquo;, the Coleman Report I think it was, specifically stated that pre-integration black schools _in the South_ were getting as much if not more funding than white ones.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the problem now?  Do we have so many children in schools that there isn&rsquo;t enough money to go around?  Are the Feds defrauding us in some way or another?  Or has the cost of &#8216;a computer in every class room&rsquo; and &#8216;no child left behind&rsquo; simply gone so high that it cannot be compensated for all students?  It&rsquo;s really time we got some straight answers on why segregation worked, economically, in the 50s and single-race standards cannot do so today.</p>
<p>The one thing you should also realize is that social intelligence, bred through hours of &#8216;practice&rsquo; with the people your children will be cheek by jowl with for the rest of their lives, likely trumps actual intelligence and technical proficiency.  In a socialist nanny state.</p>
<p>So if you want to pull your white baby out of school and put him/her with other whites or into home schooling, make DAMN SURE you create a working environment where they don&rsquo;t have to emmigrate to China to find a high paying technical profession.</p>
<p>This nation has given away it&rsquo;s industry and it&rsquo;s office professions and without a smart graduate base to support the universites, in another 20 years it will also have lost it&rsquo;s leading R&D; role among the richer, smarter, more success-not-social-engineering focussed nations.</p>
<p>Not least of them the PRC who continue to pursue an active eugenics and genetic research program to produce super-IQ mentalists.</p>
<p>The only way out that I can see out of this is to disenfranchise Federal nanny stateism as it has attempted to lobotomize and disavow us, it&rsquo;s historical, white, cultural base.</p>
<p>That means mass secession.  That means internal schooling rights for not just local districts but communities.  Probably with internet based multi-schooling and early entrance AP courses out of individual subdivisions, taking community college level expert courses to cram for knowledge base &#8216;after graduation&rsquo; in the 15 period.  Cutting three years off the competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that we have to protect our kids from the encroachment of the idiot brigade and their diversitard enablement industry ($$$) it&rsquo;s that we have to _be prepared_ to massively underbid the costs of conventional schooling once we are cut free and on our own.  While sustaining absolute peak level education.</p>
<p>Very small classes/buildings, very focussed learning, highly effective non-remedial based, plateau-and-peak, advancement thresholds (instead placing more emphasis on computerized rote systems for students with difficulty in particular areas), all coordinated with the very bleeding edge of active industrial and trades based SOA and jobs needs, maintained on a daily updated data base system.  </p>
<p>And tuned to -our- children&rsquo;s innate learning capabilities.</p>
<p>There is not time to hold the hands of 85 IQ inner city students or discipline immoral and/or illiterate or even non-fluent immigrants.  Nor to bus kids hither and yon.</p>
<p>We may have to do in two hours, twice a week, what others use school-daze childcare to inculcate or 8+ hours.  Half of which the students are too tired and bored to care what they are being told.</p>
<p>This is the post-United States.  This is education for the revolution.</p>
