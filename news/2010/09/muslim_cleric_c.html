<h1>Muslim Cleric Calls for Beheading of Dutch Politician</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Berkowitz, Reuters, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A well-known Australian Muslim cleric has called for the beheading of Dutch anti-Islamic politician Geert Wilders, a newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; Freedom Party scored the biggest gains in June 9 polls and is currently negotiating to form a new minority government with the Liberals and Christian Democrats. Polls show Wilders would win a new election if one were called now.</p>
<p>Wilders demanded to know why he had learnt about the threat from the newspaper and not from Dutch authorities who are guarding him after a film and remarks he made angered Muslims around the world.</p>
<p>De Telegraaf, the Netherlands&rsquo; largest newspaper, led its front page on Friday with a story on the speech by Feiz Muhammad.</p>
<p>The Sydney-born Muhammad has gained notoriety for, among other things, calling on young children to be radicalized and blaming rape victims for their own attacks.</p>
<p>The paper posted an English-language audio clip in which he refers to Wilders as &#8220;this Satan, this devil, this politician in Holland&#8221; and explains that anyone who talks about Islam like Wilders does should be executed by beheading.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Freedom Party leader made a film in 2008 which accused the Koran of inciting violence and mixed images of terrorist attacks with quotations from the Islamic holy book.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But his views have also made him extremely popular with a segment of the country uneasy about the Netherlands&rsquo; commitment to multiculturalism.<br>

		<p>Wilders platform calls for a halt to migration from the Muslim lands.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what really bothers the cleric. Jihad means dedicating ones life to bringing Dar al-Harb (the lands of the unbelievers) closer to Islamic dominance.</p>
<p>As a good Jihadist, Feiz Muhammad supports lots of immigration by Muslims who will have large families.  Wilders is his natural enemy. </p>

		<p>Muslims get all riled up whenever someone points out the problems with their false prophet and false religious system but they have no problem systematically abusing young boys in their Bacha Bazi </p>

<p>Now those who do such things merit beheadings&hellip; not honest politicians trying to keep this Islamic evil out of their countries.</p>

		<p>Middle Easterners are bringing their DNA and culture to wherever they go.  There is not some DNA and culture swap that happens at the border.  Non-white people whether they are East Asian or African will always be non-white.  Middle Easterners doing this stuff should be expected wherever they are because it&rsquo;s in their DNA and culture.</p>

<p>Well, they encouraged these people to emigrate.  Now let them enjoy the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>If there is really true justice in the world, it will be the elites who wind up being victims.  Maybe before their last gasp, they&rsquo;ll be horrified to realize what a mistake they made.</p>
<p>But I doubt it.  They&rsquo;re just too dimwitted for that.</p>

		<p>This lunatic cleric, and the thousands of others around the world, along with their equally dangerous to Caucasians brothers-in-arms known as diversity advocates, should be muzzled. Can&rsquo;t you say? Democratic nations like Australia and the US believe in free speech? Indeed, in 1787 and 1791, when the Constitution and Bill of Rights were adopted there were excellent reasons for freedom of speech. A pious and educated (not by public schools either) white populace governed itself with order and self-control.</p>
<p>Times have changed. The Barabarians, as in the late fourth and fifth centuries AD in the Roman Empire, are at the gates of civilization. Perhaps worse. They are inside our Romes and Byzantiums.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for a new Constitution. No immigration. America First in business and trade. A weak FederalGovt. With free speech, property rights/due process and gun rights for some. </p>
<p>And not for all. All men/women are not created equal. Nor are all religions.</p>

		<p>Ice, it is always the common folks on the street who suffer the effects of the decisions of politicians.  The latter usually live in gated communities far from the terrors that they have inflicted on the populace.</p>
<p>The UK is gone, and by the looks of it, Amsterdam and France as well.    Now it seems the US has gotten in line, with this &#8220;community center&#8221; idiocy.</p>
<p>(What are these Muslims doing in Australia?  I thought the Australians at least would have more sense than this.  This man&rsquo;s threats should have gotten him kicked out of the country.)</p>
<p>How much longer are whites going to put up with this?  Is being wimpy and suicidal now hard wired into our DNA?</p>

		<p>This imam may have bitten off more than he can chew.  &#8220;Incitement to murder&#8221; is probably a crime in Australia, where free speech laws are not like they are in the USA.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but America is responsible for much of this.  Whatever happens in the USA is soon happening everywhere.  We set the standard.  After the US &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; upheavals of the 60s and the re-writing of our immigration laws, all the white countries soon followed suit, like lemmings   &mdash;   from Australia to Sweden. They all decided they wanted to get multicultural too. They wanted to get just like the USA.  In fact, they were going to show us how to do it right!   (Ha!)</p>
<p>It became the fad&hellip; inspired by America. Within ten years, Sweden had declared  itself officially a multi-racial country, Australia abandoned its &#8220;White Australia&#8221; policy, Canada threw open its doors to the Third World, France began importing North Africans, etc.  </p>
<p>It became somewhat embarrassing to be an all-white country. How awful! Shame on you!   Something had to be done to &#8220;fix&#8221; that. Better hurry and import some refugees, immigrants, guest workers, illegal aliens.  You must prove that you&rsquo;re not racists. No right-thinking person wanted their country to remain &#8220;disgustingly white&#8221;.  White groveling and white guilt became all the rage. We must atone for our sins against the Third World. We must pay for our White Privilege. We must compensate People of Color.</p>
<p>All of this multiculty mania came from out of the USA. The world is still living with it, and we&rsquo;re seeing the consequences today.<br>

		<p>Pakistani Minister wants Obama to declare himself &#8221;Caliph of all Muslims&#8221;</p>
<p>Islamabad, Sep 2 (PTI) A Pakistani minister wants US President Barack Obama to offer Eid prayers at Ground Zero in New York and become the &#8220;Amir-ul-Momineen&#8221; or Caliph of Muslims. </p>
<p>Durrani, a former member of the Pakistan Ideological Council, contended that the Muslim world is in &#8220;dire need&#8221; of a Caliph and occupying this distinguished slot would provide Obama &#8220;exemplary titles&#8221; like &#8220;Mullah Barack Hussain Obama&#8221; or &#8220;Allama Obama&#8221;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this way, all the problems of the Muslim world would be solved,&rdquo; Durrani told The Nation newspaper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not sure if this was meant rhetorically, but anyway, Muslims are becoming an ever-increasing threat in Australia, too. France, the UK, Netherlands etc do obviously have a significant head start on us but make no mistake, these issues are popping up with ever-increasing frequency in Australia too. Google &#8220;Sheik Al Hilaly&#8221; for one of the chief rabble-rousers amongst them.</p>

		<p>Freedom of religion in the original form only meant freedom to practice one&rsquo;s own faith and not have one imposed by the state, &#8216;The Church of England&#8221;, that is what people were fleeing from. The original statement has been so distorted it is appalling. Muslims once they cross the threshold will demand Islamic laws as they are doing in Europe and then we will be screwed by our own misinterpretation of the freedom of religion in the Constitution, since the Islamics don&rsquo;t believe in the freedom of religion. Please understand the Constitution without paying attention to the distortion you get from MSM and proclaim it loudly and clearly. No I don&rsquo;t want anyone&rsquo;s religion imposed.</p>

		<p>Each and every day just reinforces that Western Europe and the US should have listened to Enoch Powell. The Toxteth &amp; Brixton riots in GB were for all practical purposes their versions of the Watts and Detroit (1967) riots. When he served in India, Powell got to see &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; up close and personal between the Hindus and Muslims. </p>
<p>When it is translated to English, Mosque of Notre Dame: 2048 should be required reading in our schools. The US and Russia are about the only places left where this book could be written without the author doing 25 to life for a &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221;. </p>
