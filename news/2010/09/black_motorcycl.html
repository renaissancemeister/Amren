<h1><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/202485.php">Black Motorcyclists Even in Helmets More Likely to Die in Crashes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medical News Today, September 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American victims of motorcycle crashes were 1.5 times more likely to die from their injuries than similarly injured whites, even though many more of the African-American victims were wearing helmets at the time of injury, according to a new study by Johns Hopkins researchers.</p>
<p>Results of the research revealing these racial disparities, published in the August issue of the American Journal of Surgery, suggest that injury-prevention programs like state laws mandating the use of motorcycle helmets may not be sufficient to protect all riders equally.</p>
<p>&#8220;For reasons that we are still trying to figure out, one size of injury prevention does not fit all groups of people and just wearing a helmet is not enough,&#8221; says Adil Haider, M.D., M.P.H., an assistant professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the study&rsquo;s senior author. &#8220;Helmet for helmet, African-Americans have more lethal injuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haider, who is also co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Surgical Trials and Outcomes Research, suspects several factors may combine to account for the gap in survival between black and white victims. Previous studies of other accidents and illnesses have shown that lack of health insurance, reduced access to care, poorer quality of care and a greater number of pre-existing illnesses or injuries contribute to racial differences in survival. It is also possible, he says, that riders of different races may prefer different types of helmets or more dangerous types of motorcycles. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the new study, Haider and surgical resident Dr. Joseph Crompton reviewed National Trauma Data Bank information on 68,840 people involved in motorcycle crashes between 2002 and 2006. Along with the finding that even after controlling for factors such as insurance status, gender and injury severity, black crash victims were 1.5 times more likely to die from their injuries than similarly injured white victims. This was so despite the fact that black motorcycle crash victims were 30 percent more likely to be wearing helmets when injured than were white crash victims. The research also found that whites who were not wearing helmets were less likely to die than African-Americans who were wearing helmets, and that the highest mortality rates were among African-American motorcyclists without helmets.</p>

		<p>Motorcycles are racist. They were invented by white men for white men. </p>
<p>I think the problem is that blacks have a very aggressive attitude and think everyone will get out of their way and that&rsquo;s a very unsafe attitude to have when riding a bike. </p>

		<p>Of course, the likely purpose of the article is to imply that the reason for the disparity is probably racism.  Another example of wasted time, expense and effort on endless race-based explanations for the purpose of reinforcing &#8220;racism&#8221; as the problem.  Perhaps a more useful study to the benefit of all motorcyclists would have been to identify the factors contributing to the increased likelihood of injury and death from motorcycle accidents and then using that data to implement measures to prevent or reduce them. </p>

		<p>I know! I know!  Since it can&rsquo;t possibly be that black bikers are more careless, it <i>must</i> be the Racist helmet manufacturers, rigging their helmets to cause more injuries to blacks!  Or maybe it&rsquo;s the bikes themselves, slyly constructed by Racist makers to recognize the presence of a black rider and fail at the most critical times!</p>
<p>After all, the CIA invented AIDS to wipe out blacks, didn&rsquo;t it?  Where are Jessie and Al?  Disparate impact! Time for another lawsuit!<br>

		<p>One thing the police noticed in all these crashes was that there were skid marks left from the cars that hit white motorcyclists, but there were no skid marks left by the cars that hit black motorcyclists.</p>
<p>It appears that when a white motorcyclist was hit by a car, the driver was more likely to slam on the brakes, but when a black motorcyclist was hit, the driver was more likely to slam on the accelerator.</p>

		<p>I ride and there are two things I see in regard to black riders.  First, they are usually being very reckless trying to show off.  Second, they are usually speeding. I also notice that blacks are almost always on &#8220;crotch-rockets&#8221; instead of cruisers, though it is their poor riding skills and judgment that is the real issue.</p>

		<p>Clearly this muslim (he has a muslim Iraqi name) &#8220;author&#8221; knows nothing about motorcycles, people that ride them and probably little about medical science. Blacks particularly like the big Japanese rockets, I personally have one that will do 187mph in just more than 6 seconds and it isn&rsquo;t much modified and many, a great many, are even faster! I ride a Harley and a Yamaha Road Star and the riding style is different, bike is heavier and slower overall by quite a lot and riding position is much different. Impacts riding the Japanese rockets result in the rider, with or without helmet, hitting head first like a projectile whereas the cruiser bikes, first impact is likely to be the front end of the motorcycle which absorbs much of the energy. So pay no attention to the &#8220;author&#8221; behind the government search for racissssssm even in motorcycle accidents. </p>

		<p>Without having read anything on this and going strictly off what I see riding around, blacks are usually on crotch rockets.  This study is ultimately pointless as there are so many other factors to consider when looking for a trend in vehicular accidents; speed, type of bike, road conditions, experience, age, any impairments, etc.</p>

		<p>Death is racist! President Obama will empower a diverse commission and hire a czar to head a new bureaucracy to root out the cause of this racial inequity.</p>
<p>The President will fund this mandate by quadrupling the tanning tax and starting a new national belt tax.</p>
<p>The NAACP, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan and Jessie Jackson will lead the protests against racist motorcycle manufacturers, racist helmet makers and the obviously racist motorcycle salesman who encouraged American Africans to buy the dangerous bikes while steering Caucasians to the safe bikes.<br>
 <br>
Rumors in the black community of a government plot to murder innocent blacks by motorcycle are rampant. </p>
<p>Lawyers are signing up all blacks who ever rode, thought of riding or looked at a motorcycle for a class action suit against the Department of Transportation for allowing this racist death toll to ever occur.</p>
<p>The payout will not be called Reparations, simply a settlement for past discriminatory practices by the evil Pre-Obama U.S. government.<br>

		<p>I was a successful MX racer in the late &rsquo;60s and early &rsquo;70s, and worked in the industry as well.  For &#8220;some reason,&#8221; blacks really don&rsquo;t seem to get along with motorcycles, regardless of the recent MX champ, who was black.  There are always exceptions, but the rule is that blacks are just more reckless, no matter what they do.</p>

		<p>Black folks tend to only ride the Hayabusa and bikes like it, where they are likely to die when they crash. For sure they are going to die at 125+, which the sport bikes will hit.</p>

<p>Actually, the stats indicate that older men die on Harleys and younger men on sport bikes.  Both have one thing in common, they haven&rsquo;t been riding that long, and/or they never had a dirt bike apprenticeship, which really teaches MC handling skills.  People get killed on Harleys just as much because bikes that heavy, and as large as they have become (wheelbase) makes them poor handling in a crisis.  I think sport bikers belong on the race track and nowhere else.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve rarely seen Blacks riding motorcycles.  There&rsquo;s no doubt that there aren&rsquo;t that many Blacks who own and ride.  We already know that there aren&rsquo;t any proficient Black racing car drivers.  What makes anyone think that Blacks can ride a motorcycle with skill?  - And riding a motorcycle takes a skill that is far more complex than driving a car.  We already know about the &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Here in the Jackson Metro, there seem, suddenly, to be a huge number of scrawny young blacks on motorcycles.  They whiz past us on the interstate&hellip;do &#8220;standies&#8221; while whizzing past people on the interstate.</p>
<p>When I see one doing that ahead of me, I&rsquo;m thinking about what is going to happen if his vehicle goes out of control.  It is almost certain that he will fly across every single lane of traffic&hellip;sending cars in all directions, crashing into each other&hellip;  It scares me to death, to think what would probably happen.</p>
<p>If people truly do not brake before they hit black motorcyclists, my guess is that it&rsquo;s because THEY DON&rsquo;T HAVE TIME TO REACT.  How on earth would anyone be able to react to an object suddenly skidding into their lane at 120mph?</p>

		<p>First thing that comes to mind when reading the article is that they must not have controlled well for injury severity if blacks are dieing at a higher rate for &#8220;similar&#8221; injuries. </p>
<p>Anyone that has studied motorcycle accident rates knows that years of experience riding is extremely important in determining the odds of a individual rider being involved in a accident. Yet I didn&rsquo;t see that mentioned in the article. </p>

		<p>In fact this article makes no sense and just mixes oranges and apples.  First it says it is working with injuries that are similar because they have been adjusted for severity. That would indeed be a level playing field to start a comparison of end results from similar injuries between races, but then it says there are differences in results even if both have helmets. Given the former criteria of adjusting for severity it is irrelevant to the study whether helmets are involved. A race related helmut study on the other hand would  instead determine whether injuries are similar given the same impact force from an accident, which is not what they  say they are measuring. Thus we have no idea what they have really done or how and can only conclude someone is simply trying to find more racism against blacks by using another  pseudo study.</p>

<p>LOL!  Thanks for the image!  More than likely that is the case. It always irked me to see blacks, mexicans etc. on bikes. For some reason they don&rsquo;t look &#8220;right&#8221; riding what is a White thing.  The same goes for convertibles. They look so out of place and FOREIGN, just as they do in our country.</p>

		<p>As a sport-bike fruitcake of the most depraved sort, I can say without qualification that blacks, who also favor all-out sportbikes, are the most aggressive riders of all.  They love block-long wheelies, maniacal highway speeds, and often do so without adequate protective gear.</p>
<p>A few years back I fell in with a group of four or five brothers coming back from the big monthly Ephrata, PA Sunday morning bike meet.  Though they wore helmets then (then mandated in PA), they were dressed in sneakers, running shorts, and T-shirts.  They rode so aggressively that I actually had a hard time keeping up with them (what fun!), though I cringed at the thought of any of them going down in a high-speed turn. Strangely, blacks seem to have an instinctive and intuitive mastery of motorcycle dynamics, much more so than they do with cars.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s because a sportbike is much more an extension of the rider than is a car of the driver.</p>
<p>In any event, they&rsquo;re a lot of fun to ride with.</p>

On another note, I think there is something to this blacks and helmet combination. I was hit more than twice as many times while wearing my Black Shoei then I was while wearing my White Arai, and I was less experienced when I had the White helmet.</p>

		<p>Maybe they prefer the Japanese-made racing bikes.  These are overpowered and require both skill and good judgement, which young black men are not likely to have.  The whites here in Colorado Springs seem to prefer Harley-Davidsons softtails with straight pipes.  They&rsquo;re loud, but not as likely to kill a fellow.</p>

		<p>After I finished clapping like a trained sea lion I gave this matter some serious consideration and I think cognitive ability, impulse control, demography and geography are factors that need to be included in this equation. </p>
<p>While it is probably true that part of the reason for the disparate carnage is the fact that Blacks are less likely than Whites to have honed their riding skills on dirt bikes and less powerful street bikes before they stepped up to crotch rockets, I think that WHERE Blacks ride may also be a determining factor in their higher death toll.</p>
<p>Most Blacks live in and around high population areas with congested roads. The cities with the highest black populations are the old cities that were built in hilly river valleys. The groups of White riders who routinely hit 150-175 miles per hour on the straight, flat roads of North Central Texas would probably not live long on the winding, hilly roads surrounding Philadelphia or Cincinnati. </p>
<p>Combine a screaming, lightning-fast crotch-rocket with those winding, hilly, heavily-traveled  roads, lack of rider skill, nearly non-existent rider impulse control and poor rider problem-solving skills resulting from low cognitive ability and you&rsquo;ll get a gore-fest almost every time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Actually, the stats indicate that older men die on Harleys and younger men on sport bikes. Both have one thing in common, they haven&rsquo;t been riding that long&#8221;</p>
<p>With 50+ years on motorcycles I say you are wrong Whiteplight, no disrespect intended. Older men, and most men/women killed on Harleys are killed by inattentive automobile drivers, NOT by their own inattention, carelessness or inexperience I KNOW, I have had a great number of friends killed by auto drivers and the excuse is always &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t see him&#8221; One friend was struck down, run over and dragged under the car for several hundred yards in Greenburg, C.C. and the newpaper did not mention that the driver was 80 years old with poor vision, BUT it did mention that he was not wearing a helmet! a helmet is not required in S.C. for over 21 riders. Another friend was knocked down and powered over while stopped in traffic by a drunk driver leaving a bar, in the accident, the drunk powered over my friend tearing his left foot off and badly injuring the girl on the back..The news paper did not mention the driver of the car was out on probation for a 7th DUI! it DID mention however that my friend was &#8220;not wearing a helmet&#8221; I could go on and on&hellip;suffice to say, an inattentive automobile driver is the most dangerous thing on the highways today, and there are a GREAT MANY of them.</p>

		<p>This is not (crotch) rocket science. Low IQ, high impulsivity and aggression will get you killed on a motorcycle&hellip;helmet or not. I recall seeing some black blasting through heavy urban traffic well into the hundreds. I stayed in my lane and waited for the inevitable. He went down in a shower of sparks and I saw the wheels of the semi bouncing up and down over his carcass. I just hope his organs were harvestable.  </p>

		<p>In terms of generations blacks are much closer than whites and east Asians to a way of life where every young man participated in tribal warfare, and the best warriors had the most wives, and consequently the most children. <br>
 <br>
This explains a number of things about blacks, including a greater willingness to take physical risks.  I suspect American Indians and Australian aborigines are also more likely to die in motor cycle accidents.  <br>

		<p> This is an easy one. Anyone who has seen  how blacks behave in traffic knows that the great majority of them drive as if they owned the road. They may have good reflexes, but that doesn&rsquo;t help when you&rsquo;re driving way in over your head in a high performance auto or crotch-rocket bike. As mentioned above, they tend not to work on skills deliberately, or attend any more training than absolutely necessary. They are agressive to and well beyond the point of recklessness. Their vehicles become instant extensions of their primitive egos. The results should surprise no one.</p>

		<p>One of my high school friends was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1987 at the age of 21.  He was wearing a helmet, but was tearing down Boulder Canyon at an insane speed and missed a turn, hitting the guardrail.  This catapulted him out into Boulder creek, where he landed on the exposed rocks there.  The only good the helmet did was allow an open-casket funeral.  The toxicology report said there was alcohol and traces of cocaine in his system.</p>
<p>Sufficiently bad judgement is all it takes.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I suspect you have struck upon a very significant point there. </p>
<p>At the other extreme, I think Chinese and other East Asians stand furthest  from that tribal/warrior background, in terms of time/generations. Hence, their lesser degree of physical development, by contrast to blacks,  as well as their heightened intelligence, social skills, and cunning   &mdash;   and also low aggressiveness, less individuality, plus emphasis on conformity and ability to get along within a group.</p>
<p>I also suspect that Mr. Englemann is entirely correct in his guess that Amerindians and Australian abos are greater risk-takers and more prone to die in vehicle accidents   &mdash;   even IF that could be separated from the lethal effects of alcohol.</p>
