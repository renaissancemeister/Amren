<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Significant numbers of Americans and Europeans surveyed by a Financial Times/Harris Poll say immigration reduces the quality of life in their countries.</p>
<p>Immigration can be a sore subject in a down economy. According to the results of a Financial Times/Harris Poll released Friday, many people in the U.S. and in five of the largest nations in Europe believe that immigration has a negative impact on the economy, jobs and public services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Immigrants Blamed for Lower Quality of Life</b></p>
<p>For example, more than 40% of those surveyed in each of the six countries felt that the current level of immigration made their country a worse place to live, led by 64% Britain, 60% in Spain, 57% in Italy, 49% in the U.S., 44% in Germany and 43% in France.</p>
<p>When asked whether it was easier, harder or the same to find a new job because of immigration, 67% of those in Spain said it was harder to find a job, followed by 60% in Italy, 57% in the U.S., 57% in Britain, 46% in Germany and 45% in France. The majority of those polled in the U.S., Britain, France and Spain  &mdash;  and more than 40% of those in Italy and Germany  &mdash;  said immigration reduced their level of health-care services, and the majority of respondents in the U.S., Britain and Germany felt immigration damaged their public-education systems.</p>
<p>Overall, 52% of those surveyed in Britain, 51% in Spain, 48% in France, 43% in the U.S., 42% in Italy and 32% in Germany believe immigration has a negative effect on their economy. That&rsquo;s an eyebrow-raising amount of negative sentiment considering that the poll didn&rsquo;t even mention illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>When evaluating whether something is &#8220;bad for the economy,&#8221; we should ask ourselves, &#8220;Whose economy?&#8221; Employers and employees do not play a zero sum game, but their economic interests are not identical.  <br>
 <br>
A high rate of immigration means more customers and more job applicants.  By the law of supply and demand this means higher prices, lower wages, and consequently, higher profits.<br>
 <br>
If you are in the employer - investor class, you benefit from a high rate of immigration.  If you work for a living, you do not.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Ted Kennedy is being rewarded for his hand in that 1965 immigration reform (which was before my time).</p>
<p>I am all for quotas.  What&rsquo;s needed right now is a moratorium on legal immigration.  Jobs should go to natural-born American citizens first  &mdash;  what jobs are left, of course.</p>

		<p>One of the primary arguments in favor of immigration is that &#8220;it is is good for the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this ignores the fact that happiness in life and the quality of a society is much, much more than just money.  Basing all decisions solely on the economy (money) is not only ridiculous, it is outright evil.  Slavery, prostitution, drugs, and child labor all would &#8220;increase the economy,&#8221; but we don&rsquo;t do these things, because they are bad.  Basing immigration on economic reasons is likewise reprehensible.</p>
<p>But aside from that, the idea that immigration improves the economy is a BIG LIE.  True, massive immigration makes money for certain greedy people in the agriculture, building, landscape, and meat-packing industries, and restaurant and hotel owners.  But, these profits that go into the pockets of rich business owners are small compared to the massive governmental costs (taxes that you must pay) for the education, medical care, housing, food stamps, incarceration, and crime and accident costs) of illegals. The greedy business owners make money by pocketing profits, while pushing the costs on to us taxpayers. The sell their greed to the gullible public as &#8220;they just want a better life,&#8221; and &#8220;they have &#8220;family values,&#8221; and &#8220;we are all immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, it is true that the overall gross economy of an area will  rise if you pack another million people into that area, because those million people will buy food, use toilet paper, rent videos, etc.  However, it is not GROSS, but INDIVIDUAL (per capita) economy that is important.  Who cares if sales of taco meat raise 20%, if the entire area triples in population, is plunged into poverty, and if YOU have been replaced by an immigrant who works off-the-books for 50% lower salary?</p>
<p>There are a thousand things that contribute to a high-quality life.  Massive immigration is not one of them.  It increases overpopulation, crime, &amp; drugs, pollution, traffic, disease, poverty, hospital closing, decline in schools, and social-stress.  It erodes the fabric of our society and culture, and will make America a worse place for our children.  It must be stopped, immediately.<br>

<p>Well, big surprise here!</p>
<p>To begin with, traditional immigration (of the racially and culturally compatible) as seen from the 1870s to 1900s in the USA, can be socially straining. This would be under conditions of economic expansion and relative prosperity, mind you. Moreover, that is only if the majority of such compatible immigrants (90% minimum) are here to work and not feed off the system, while spewing idiotic &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; demands. </p>
<p>That is not what happens these days: industry is &ldquo;outsourced;&rdquo; education is high-jacked; and the remaining social services and jobs, are &ldquo;redistributed&rdquo; to the laughably defined &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; and &ldquo;underprivileged.&rdquo; Is it any wonder, that the moderately discomforting and disturbing presumptions of our Red elites in the West in boom times, become absurd and unbearable in an economic crisis such as this in 2010? </p>
<p>In other words, what they call &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; is beyond and beneath intolerable!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Illegal immigrants must go, must be cut off from jobs and welfare. But the real big problem has been and is legal immigration. That&rsquo;s where the job competition for most European-Americans is . High tech, education, research and development, healthcare, government jobs and business ownership. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they have green cards or reunify families. I don&rsquo;t care if they marry a Swedish or German American. Their cultures and values are inconsistent with American values as evolved from the sixteenth century to the 1965 Immigration Law snuck through by the worst President ever-Lyndon Baines Johnson.</p>
<p>Stop the immigration now. And if in a few decades it resumes, restrict it to Europeans. And I don&rsquo;t mean current &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who reside in Britain and the EU or their descendents.</p>

		<p>Does immigration benefit the economy?  Not the kind of legal and illegal immigration to which the federal government is wedded.  Washington Post economic columnist Robert J. Samuelson:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our present policy is to import poor people. &hellip; We need an immigration policy that makes sense. My oft-stated belief is that legal immigration should favor the high-skilled over the low-skilled. They will assimilate quickest and aid the economy the most&#8221; (&#8220;Importing Poverty,&#8221; Robert J. Samuelson, economics columnist, Washington Post, Sept. 5, 2007). </p>

<p>The article is from the Daily Finance so we can infer their bias.</p>
<p>What they mean is they need to keep the lid on anti-immigrant sentiments until the economy recovers just enough so people won&rsquo;t see the problem.</p>

		<p>Immigigration is great for the economy in absolute terms as far as things like GDP growth are concerned, I mean even the most hapless and useless immigrants require goods, food, services etc. However it also almost always drastically lower standards of living as well, as mass immigration lowers wages, increase taxes, and increases crime and general mayhem. It is a stupid question.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great news. But, why aren&rsquo;t we putting a stop to it. Why aren&rsquo;t we inundating the politicians with calls of disgust at their love affair with &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221;. Diversity is a code word for continued post 1965 immigration because that&rsquo;s the source of our diversity. If we had maintain our predominantly European style immigration policy diversity wouldn&rsquo;t exist. In order to stop legal immigration, we must organized the same way we did to stop amnesty for illegal aliens. Responding to polls is not enough to change the situation.</p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p><i>This survey underlines the political problems that confront governments and politicians when they are addressing issues of immigration, and the easy opportunities for populist leaders to win votes by advocating anti-immigration policies. And of course the issue of illegal immigration, that was not addressed in this survey, is much more difficult.</i></p>
<p>The political problems that confront &#8220;governments and politicians&#8221;??? The only problem is that &#8220;governments and politicians&#8221; are not being held to account. It sounds like the pollster took it for granted that &#8220;governments and politicians&#8221; should promote immigration and that they considered it a problem that the people don&rsquo;t want it.<br>

		<p>The one problem here is that the article is written from the premise that these people are having their perspectives clouded by the bad economy. &#8220;Immigration can be a sore subject in a down economy.&#8221; No, immigration can be a sore subject when the government allows too much immigration from the wrong countries. </p>

		<p>John, it&rsquo;s called exporting and outsourcing. You don&rsquo;t need immigration at all for economic reasons, unless you&rsquo;re a government. You can&rsquo;t tax people living overseas. It&rsquo;s not like only Americans can consume in this world and once you step of American soil you stop doing it.</p>

Immigration can be a sore subject in a down economy. According to the results of a Financial Times/Harris Poll released Friday, many people in the U.S. and in five of the largest nations in Europe believe that immigration has a negative impact on the economy, jobs and public services.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Problem 1.  It&rsquo;s not &#8216;believe&rsquo; unless it&rsquo;s seen as being something aberrant as a child &#8216;believing&rsquo; in monsters under the bed so much they don&rsquo;t sleep.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
That&rsquo;s an eyebrow-raising amount of negative sentiment considering that the poll didn&rsquo;t even mention illegal immigration.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Problem #2.  Why does anyone rate a concept&rsquo;s validity by popularity?  I mean _the economy_ is in the tank.  Thus it should have long since been a study of ALL FACTORS related to it that caused the demographics of Say&rsquo;s Law &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to be analyzed as potentially an economic choking factor.</p>
<p>Which is where things really become critical.  Because a market economy is like a &#8216;representative&rsquo; democracy.  A world run by intermediary values, divorced utterly from the reality of the actual economic status of the society under effect.</p>
<p>Where Say&rsquo;s states that production is it&rsquo;s own demand and product:product trades create economic dynamism, the fact that -work product- values are indiscriminately leveraged by economists who control overseas outsourcing of all high skill jobs prevents a proper VERTICAL FLOW of that cash between wealthy classes and middle American skillled workers.</p>
<p>If the wealthy do not pay the price of value-for-work that is more than a service economy driven lifestyle (engineering, manufacture, infrastructure sustainment etc.) then they have no reason to see the other half of the equation which is that when you are trading laterally, product for product, at a junk consumerist level of base subsistence goods then THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE on which Say&rsquo;s laws is based, is abrogated by the lack of high end production goods to drive up the value of the market itself.  i.e.  To sustain the cash markup necessary for the wage earners to contribute in a society which they cannot buy into -except- at the most basic of in-class lateral product exchanges.</p>
<p>You have effectively crippled the U.S. system of wealth building for those below a certain median income level.  And they are the ones who are being &#8216;elected a replacement&rsquo; for in the form of hostile immigrant dumb-labor who _don&rsquo;t want_ more than an LMI security of that subsistence market.</p>
<p>This is how economies go from the first world to the third.  Because once there is no sense of riseable elitism, there is also no innovation and high end capabilities increase to sustain the wealth diffusion of the higher value dollar of (investor) classes back down into development of product:product diffusion systems that keeps the value of the overall market high.</p>
<p>The whole thing statifies and stagnates to entropy.</p>

		<p>Immigration is a policy of genocide against white people.   Those who push it are hate-filled Nazis or collaborators who are in it for the money.   This is the only thing that matters in the immigration debate. </p>
<p>As to economics, even pro-invasion sources acknowledge that the economic contribution of immigrants is very minor,  the most optimistic of them that I&rsquo;ve seen claimed that immigrants contributed about 80 billion dollars (unlikely) in an economy that was then worth something like 13 TRILLION.  Peanuts, the equivalent of destroying your home and family for a couple of hundred a year.  The latest tact the genocide crowd is using is claiming that the invasion is good for American workers because it allows or even forces them to move up into supervisory or creative positions:    </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24hbltq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24hbltq</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a cynical appeal to greed, that also gives the cowards among conservative and other whites a face-saving excuse for their pusillanimity.  The counter is not only to point to all the studies that show these immigrants contribute little (or cause a net loss) now, but to also point out the political changes these migrants will cause and the disastrous economic effects third world politics will have on the American economy.  The open borders traitors,  whether they be of the crypto-communist or big binness variety, like to present immigrants as solely economic units that mysteriously have no effect on society or government or quality of life (except good) as a way to prevent the polloi from thinking and talking about these things.  They would like to keep the debate about economics.   People who oppose the invasion should make the effects of future third world racial politics on the economy part of that economic debate. </p>

		<p>We are NOT &#8220;all immigrants.&#8221; An immigrant is one who leaves a political state to go to another political state. The first whites who landed here were SETTLERS, not &#8220;immigrants.&#8221; So if you trace your lineage back to the original English settlers, don&rsquo;t let anyone fool you with that &#8220;Unless you&rsquo;re a &#8216;Native American&rsquo;, you&rsquo;re an immigrant&#8221; nonsense. </p>

		<p>Is Immigration Bad for the Economy? - Many People Say Yes&hellip;.but only to pollsters.  If you say it to the main stream media you are a Racist, Nazi, Facist or as our former Prime Minister called a prospective voter who asked him in public about the topic - a bigot! (He did not realise the microphone was still on).  This is why as  &#8216;sbuffalonative&rsquo; wrote -  people won&rsquo;t see the problem or similarly &#8216;conscious of the times&rsquo; wrote -  why aren&rsquo;t we innundating politicians with calls of disgust&rsquo;.  We are all afraid to stick our heads above the parapet.  </p>
<p>Our Geography teacher at school - long ago - told us that you could fit the British Isles into the pan handle of Texas and still have room to spare.  The Government predict that we are heading for a population of 70 million but have also admitted that 40 million would be about right for the size of the country. But, hey, we can squeeze in a few more&hellip;..millions.  Interesting times.</p>
