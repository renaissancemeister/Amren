<h1>Illegal Immigrant Indicted for Murder in Nun&rsquo;s Death</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Babay, Washington Examiner, September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The illegal immigrant accused of killing a Benedictine nun in a drunken driving crash in Prince William County has been indicted for murder.</p>
<p>Carlos A. Martinelly Montano, 23, now faces a charge of felony murder, court records show, for the Aug. 1 crash that killed Sister Denise Mosier, 66.</p>
<p>Authorities allege that Montano was drunk when a Subaru Outback he was driving struck a guardrail then collided head-on with a car carrying Mosier and two other nuns on Bristow Road near Wright Lane.</p>
<p>Montano was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, drunken driving, and driving on a revoked license.</p>
<p>Sisters Charlotte Lange, 75, and Connie Ruth Lupton, 70, were seriously injured in the crash.</p>
<p>The grand jury also indicted Montano with driving with a revoked license and maiming resulting from drunken driving.</p>
<p>He could receive up to 40 years in prison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Benedictine Sisters acknowledge that Carlos Martinelly Montano must be served due justice for his actions,&#8221; Sister Cecilia Dwyer said. &#8220;We trust that the courts will be moderate and just in the handling of his case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When he was charged in the Aug. 1 crash, Montano had two previous DUI convictions. He had been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but was released pending a deportation hearing.</p>
<p>This week, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told the state Department of Motor Vehicles to stop accepting a federally issued work authorization card as proof of legal status.</p>
<p>Montano had received the employment authorization card in January 2009, months after deportation proceedings had begun for his second DUI offense. Authorities say he used the card to show his legal status when applying for a Virginia ID.</p>
<p>Corey Stewart, chairman of the county board of supervisors, has asked Congress to subpoena federal immigration records to find out how many illegal immigrants were released after arrest.<br/>

		<p>The family or estate of Sister Denise should go after the gov organizations responsible for this guy not being immediately deported. Sue them in civil court and bankrupt them. They helped to establish a climate that led to the death of Sister Denise.</p>

<p>The courts are already too moderate and just in cases of this type. Forty years sounds about right.</p>

		<p>There already were cases of victim&rsquo;s families suing local gov. for crimes comitted by illegal aliens. And they were not successful. Maybe some people remember Bologna family from San Francisco&hellip;. SF and other sanctuary cities protect criminal illegals aliens. Something for us citizens to feel great about..</p>

		<p>Perpetually drunk Hispanic illegals on the road. They kill. They always have many unpunished prior driving violations. Haven&rsquo;t heard one national politician of either party declare this to be a problem. Nor the Tea Party. Nor Glenn Beck. Instead, self protection laws, like Arizona&rsquo;s, are assaulted by the full fury of the Obama Justice Dept.</p>

<p>If you are an American citizen with a decent job, a DUI conviction could well cost you your livelihood, or at the very least make life very uncomfortable.  Illegal aliens have no such worries.  They literally have to kill someone, as happened here, to be held accountable.</p>

		<p>Karolina: The Bolgna case has gone from court to court, 3 times.First it was against them, next it was in their favor, last time,against them again.It is not over yet. I just hope that it will eventually be in their favor, so they can sue the City of San Francisco for tens of millions.The sad thing is that the board of Stuporvisors who made this all happen will not be affected negatively at all. </p>
