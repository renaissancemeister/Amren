<h1>Three Teens Arrested in Downtown Beating Death</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Busse and Chris Dumond, News &amp; Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia), September 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An act of teenage male bravado on the part of at least one boy may have led to Sunday&rsquo;s beating death of an 81-year-old man visiting Lynchburg for his granddaughter&rsquo;s wedding, police said.</p>
<p>Two 16-year-olds and a 13-year-old were arrested Tuesday and charged with the murder of George Leroy Baker III, of Tempe, Ariz.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though police have said they are prohibited by law from naming juveniles, a search warrant filed in Lynchburg Circuit Court on Tuesday identified Kenneth Davis as the person who ran up to Baker &#8220;in an aggressive manner&#8221; before witnesses heard what sounded like a blow to Baker&rsquo;s body and saw Davis running away.</p>
<p>Witnesses told police they heard Davis say he would hit the first person he saw in order to impress girls he was with, the affidavit from Lynchburg Det. Todd Rodes states.</p>
<p>&#8220;A witness dining at the Hash House saw a young black male kick the victim in the face after he had already been knocked to the ground,&#8221; the affidavit states. &#8220;The victim was unconscious upon bystanders coming to his aide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The affidavit states witnesses identified Davis by name and in a photo lineup as participating in the beating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is the third homicide in Lynchburg this year after the city went murder-free in 2009. Derrick Lee Payne, 25, was shot and killed near 17th and Floyd streets in May. Theodore Curtis Poe, 20, was shot and killed in the 400 block of Lakewood Street in July.</p>

		<p>Reading this brought tears to my eyes, then a surge of anger&hellip; and then I read the comments on the article and was again confronted with the indirect reasons for why his man had to die: because whites are too brainwashed, too stupid to realize the reality of race and so long as we let them, blacks will remain a menace to everything we hold dear.</p>
<p>Almost everyone commenting on that article has been infected by the mind virus of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;liberalism&#8221; - the dogma that race is irrefutably arbitrary, a mere social construct, that it&rsquo;s irrelevant at times like this (but always relevant when it suits their agendas). It breaks my heart to know that almost all of the white population has been infected by this virus, and as a result, we welcome murder, rape, and all other sorts of violence to be inflicted upon us by these animals, always with the justification that &#8220;we have been keeping them down&#8221; and the problem must be caused by poor education, bad parenting, and religious &#8220;rightwing nutcases.&#8221; These whites are all firmly of the belief that poverty and violence among blacks are caused by social conditions imposed by US when it reality it is a direct result of a genetics/low IQ! How many more people have to die before whites come together and realize that we cannot live peacefully among non-whites? I&rsquo;ve concluded that there is very likely no cure for this rampant infection. Reading things like this makes me as pessimistic as ever; this infection has festered for far too long and it has overwhelmed and destroyed any modicum of common sense left in the white cultural consciousness.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to any of the states that make up the area around D.C. Was this hotel in a heavily black area? Booking a hotel in an urban area that is unfamiliar is always a risk. Certainly, if I ended up in a hotel in a neighborhood with a lot of black faces walking about I would not go for a walk there. I try to do my research the best I can before traveling but sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint if a hotel is in a sketchy area or not.</p>

		<p>An act of &#8220;bravado&#8221;? I hardly think attacking an elderly man is an act of bravado, it&rsquo;s an act of extreme cowardice. How about attempting to attack a huge 25-year-old body builder twice his size? THAT would be an act of bravado but of course being the coward he is, he wouldn&rsquo;t as he knew what would happen.</p>

<p>That news source, NECN, is the only news source that shows the black faces of the perps.  (One of the three tries to hide in something that looks like a white bee keeper&rsquo;s suit, but you can see his black face for just long enough to know that he&rsquo;s black.)  The rest of the Boston media say boo about race, and of course the national media say boo about the whole story.  </p>
<p>What I think is going on is that the media in Boston are trying to work up the same false narrative that the national and NY media did for black-on-Hispanic hate crimes on Staten Island   &mdash;   cover up the fact that blacks did it, and go so far as to imply that whites did it, then blame talk radio and Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070.</p>
<p>The victim in this Boston pizza thing is Hispanic, from Central America.</p>

<p>My Afro colleagues are constantly living with the slightest dis-for example a local retail outlet selling Ghettopoly. After Jena 6 someone sent me a stupid call to arms (I stay neutral at work, as much as it pains me I need a paycheck, there&rsquo;s a big double standard) regarding this big violation of civil rights down south. The most angry Alpha Black male will still bring up Emmett Till. Meanwhile, white folk never bring up this stuff and even if it was brought up to most black folk it wouldn&rsquo;t register. Civil Rights and Racism etc, etc ad nauseum are only for blacks and nonwhites to fret over.</p>
<p>Nicholas Stix has a good article on this and how even though the black kid admitted to committing the crime he most likely will soon recant this, all with the backing of the black Church.<br>

<p>Yes, and the North Carolina attack where they shouted that it was &#8220;beat whitey night,&#8221; and the cop reporting the racism was admonished and demoted.</p>
<p>In fact, there have been so many similar black on white beatings and killings it would be possible to fill a book writing of them all.</p>

		<p>I think 13 and 14 and 15 and 16 year olds were regularly hung for stealing horses in the old west. Surely, this crime qualifies for a similar fate.</p>

		<p>Imagine growing up during the Depression, possibly fighting in WWII (if he lied about his age), maybe Korea, seeing your nation develop jet technology, fly into space on rockets and land on the moon, then slowly watch it all go to hell as it&rsquo;s slowly given away by your spoiled children and their descendants to the people that finally snuff you out. </p>

		<p>I read the article and the comments as well. I was more than amazed at the number of liberal, brainwashed comments regarding the cause and effect of this crime, which, as poster #2 quite well stated, is like a virus infecting whites. </p>
<p>It is possible that the newspaper selectively manipulated or deleted comments for its own self-serving, pro-diversity ends. But in reality, not one comment should reflect anything but anger and disgust at the true cause of the problem - low IQ behavior of blacks living (or unable to live) in a white society.</p>
<p>I also agree that this story gives one quite a pessimistic feel. We are really at a tipping point. The sense that some sort of vigilante justice is warranted to lead the way if whites remain cowards in their own land is a bad sign for everyone. The first step is cleansing the brain of the virus and acknowledging the problem. Otherwise we are doomed.</p>

		<p>After the lawyers get through with them the cowardly youths will be portrayed as the victims of a racist justice and educational system designed to keep them down.  Perhaps they will even go with the &#8220;he called me the n-word&#8221; defense.  Stories like this are an example of why liberalism combined with a large black population is more dangerous than any foreign enemy.  We are supposedly fighting a &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, but cases like this are nothing if not domestic terrorism and should be treated as such.  </p>

		<p>About fifteen or twenty years ago, back when stories like this one still had some shock value, I looked forward to the day that such atrocities would become so common that civilized people would feel enough outrage to make the hard choices that would end the ridiculous social experiments that put us in close proximity with dangerous people.<br>
 <br>
Well, here&rsquo;s where fifteen or twenty years have taken us: The atrocities are an everyday occurrence in every city; the social experiments are still thriving; the vermin are still in close proximity to us, no matter how many times or how far we move; and the outrage that should have ended it all years ago never happened. <br>
I have heard many theories explaining why we are where we&rsquo;re at. One of them was that the hippies grew up and put some kind of hormones in the water supply that turned most males of the historical majority of America into girly men. <br>
Ridiculous, you say? That&rsquo;s what I say, too. But it did start me to thinking. The hippies did grow up, but they didn&rsquo;t put anything in the water. They have, however, managed to put themselves in positions to influence the minds of the young and the gullible. The progressive ideas that have been gently force-fed to every open mind through the education system and the media for 40 years are exactly the same Utopian nonsense I heard hippies talking about in college in the seventies.</p>
<p>I thought culling the hippies was a good idea back then, and I think it&rsquo;s a great idea now. Their grand Utopia of love and understanding is a place where octogenarians are beaten to death by ungovernable criminals who, as likely as not, were brought into this world for the sole purpose of getting their mothers a raise on their welfare checks.</p>
<p>Hippies are deeply entrenched in grade schools, colleges, unions and community organizations that seek to lift up our largely ineducable underclass. Get rid of the hippies and we can change the rules in such a way as to keep them away from civilized people.</p>

		<p>For the first 45 years of my life, I was the rock solid liberal people here make fun of.</p>
<p>But reality - the moronic, violent, chaotic behavior of so many blacks - kept crashing through my defenses, and finally, I realized I had been lying all along:</p>
<p>There are plenty of admirable and honorable blacks, and plenty of scuzzball whites, but on the whole, blacks in the US have devolved into a kind of mindless mob, and and most blacks dream of only one thing:</p>
<p>Escaping from their own kind.</p>
<p>Blacks suffer from low cognitive ability and low impulse control, and could never have been integrated as a group into European societies. </p>
<p>Denial of the most obvious racial differences have led to catastrophe, including the ruining of dozens of great American cities. </p>
<p>There should be a running number posted somewhere representing the number of whites killed and maimed by blacks in the US over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Could be very educational for liars like the one I used to be.</p>

		<p>A very large percentage of blacks absolutely hate white people. Based upon my own lifetime of experience (30 years in corrections), I would put that number at 50% or higher of all blacks harboring intense racial hatred towards whites. Many of the blacks who don&rsquo;t hate whites are sympathetic or non-judgemental of those who do. I base my opinion, not just on observing black criminals, but also on my observation of hundreds of black co-workers over the years. This phenomena has a horrific impact on whites; yet the major media have chosen to ignore and even hide this sorry state of affairs. The late Mr.Baker (may God rest his soul) is the but the most recent martyr in the ongoing race war against whites. This race war against whites has been going on for the last half century. I hope this tragedy is a wake-up call for Mr. Baker&rsquo;s family and the rest of the decent, law abiding citizens in this country.</p>

<p>There will be a book about this incident. And a &#8216;call to action&rsquo; and a discussion among all concerned people everywhere. Except the book and the legacy sold will be filled have black victims of white hate, the astronomically smaller (but only mentionable) occurrence.

<p>You make a good point about cowardice. I was in a restaurant/bar earlier this year, I would say it was the latter part of May. There were a number of people in the place. The vast majority were White. However, there were two young Black men. I would say that they were in their early 20s. </p>
<p>Just by looking at them, you could see that they had ATTITUDE written all over them. This was confirmed when one of the men started mouth off at another customer (A young White man) who apparently, accidentally cut in front of him at the bar. This guy (the White guy) was probably somewhere slightly over 6&rsquo;0 feet, 220lbs well built and looked very athletic. The Black guy, in contrast, was very diminutive in stature, probably no more than 5&rsquo;6, 150lbs at the most if soaked with water. </p>
<p>They Black started making disrespectful comments toward the guy. Suddenly, the guy took the little Black punk, grabbed him around the neck, threw him the bar table, jacked him up again, pinned him against a wall,demanded that he retract what he said and told him he would f***ing kill him. He made some other comments as well. Guess what the so-called bad, Black young face was filled with terror. He backed down and apologized.</p>
<p>It is these sort of punk Blacks who target Whites (especially White men) they believe will not fight back. In fact, I think most Black men (including the little twerp I mentioned),are conditioned to believe that no Whites will stand up to them and thus they fell they can get away with such appalling behavior. </p>
<p>I was so glad that this young White man stood up for himself and put the punk in his place. I hope more Whites begin to do the same.  </p>

<p>Wait until the trial for these pieces of human dung.  Some corpulent sow mother will probably say that, &#8220;Well the guy was old anyway and would die soon so what&rsquo;s the big deal?&#8221;.</p>
<p>This has already happened and was after an elderly White man was beaten to death in Washington state.  Her moronic remarks caused a riot outside the courtroom.</p>

<p>Yes, there will still be those who will cling to their&#8221;religion&#8221; of diversity. </p>
<p>But let the day come when the average good citizen of America understands the gross imbalance of criminality across the racial spectrum and the uneven distribution of whites who are victims.</p>

		<p>I just hope and pray that the poor man&rsquo;s family wakes up and sees the black hatred in this country for Whites and start acting accordingly, and start speaking out and calling this horrid crime for what it is. Only cowards attack 81 yr. old men! Those blacks are nothing but sniveling cowards and the media should show them for what they are, but of course, that will never happen. </p>
<p>I used to be so patriotic of my country and proud to be an American and cried at all the flag flying and patriotic/military songs. No longer. Why? Because this is no longer the America that I loved. I loved the White America when Whites ruled America and our schools and neighborhoods were White. When we didn&rsquo;t have to fear attacks inside and outside our homes from blacks/minorities. When doors were left unlocked, walking at night and being safe. I am so ashamed of my own race for allowing this to happen in the first place and are still closing their eyes to it all. </p>

		<p>#25: So right. Blacks lost their fear of Whites starting around the mid-1960s. They know that they can usually bluff when it comes to fighting i.e. talk a good fight so Whites will back down.</p>
<p>As for consequences, these &#8220;juveniles&#8221; are probably off the hook at 18. A police officer I know said that it&rsquo;s easier to hand out benefits to criminals vs. putting them in prison. Looks like these boys will have a lifetime of food stamps, medicaid, Section 8 Housing vouchers and Social Security &#8220;crazy&#8221; checks all paid for by us.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re so right! </p>
<p>We went for a walk on the beach yesterday. It was a beautiful late summer day on the North Beach of our New Jersey barrier island. The beach was predominantly White with a few Asian families.. Quiet was the operative word. Some was quietly engaged in surf fishing, others were quietly reading or enjoying the warm, calm surf. They had their 4X4s with BBQs and beach chairs. Some were reading quietly. A pair of young Asian girls were playing chess while their two Beagles sat patiently next to them. It was 11 Sept and the entire mood of the people was quiet and perhaps even reflective.</p>
<p>I noticed the absence of Blacks and couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine how different things would have been had there been any number of them there. </p>

I&rsquo;m equally surprised that they didn&rsquo;t somehow imply that the elderly white man was racist&hellip;somehow instigating trouble with those poor troubled &#8220;urban&#8221; youths. Because it was impossible to spin this story, the liberal media simply ignored the incident.</p>

<p>Whites were around a third of those lynched. Even the civil rights folks claim that. Of course the only ones who ever draw attention are left wing whites or whites who could be Said to have been lynched for political reasons. If you were a racist or in the old Democratic party, don&rsquo;t expect it to make the news. Of course these same folks (who want us to believe only blacks were lynched) would have us believe blacks who were lynched were innocent bystanders, or perhaps even heroes. Lynching becomes tied to conservatives or evils of the past, in such a manner. Or tied to a mindset I suppose, for political purposes. lol, one might even say to an anti-law enforcement mindset also, or anti law obeying mindset - which leads to more victims in prison. Not that I believe the official totals&hellip; No way. </p>

		<p>An early poster was exactly right.  It has nothing to do with their height or build (hell, there are tall, strong white men, too).  If white men stand up to black men, they will generally back down.  They aren&rsquo;t expecting us to fight back.  If we start standing up to them, even if we lose, we will gain more respect from everyone.  Black males are only tough because whites are afraid of being called racists.  Drop the fear of being called a racist and don&rsquo;t get defensive when people call you a racist and most of our problems will go away.</p>

		<p>This same type of crime occurred in Philadelphia in a subway station only two blocks from City Hall.  A black high student in a group of six punched a white man from behind.  The victim died.  The press reported that he died from an asthma attack but the man&rsquo;s mother said that he never suffered from that disease.  It was an obvious racist attack.  It makes you wonder if we should be investing in public transportation.  The bus ans subway systems are great means of getting around a city but they are only useful in a civilized society.</p>

		<p>Yes, and the North Carolina attack where they shouted that it was &ldquo;beat whitey night,&rdquo; and the cop reporting the racism was demolished and admoted.  In fact there have been so many similar black on white beatings and killings it would be possible to fill a book. <br>
If whites continue to take it, then they deserve what they get.<br>

Maybe so. But more likely  he was part of the problem. His generation was in charge over these part 50 years, and look what they have left us. It wasn&rsquo;t some OTHER people who brought this all about. He very likely voted for JFK, LBJ, and all the rest. </p>
<p>Did he support Martin Luther King and the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; marchers and &#8220;freedom riders&#8221;?  Did he protest when the immigration laws were changed? Did he participate in, or approve of, the hippy counter-culture?   </p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know. So we can&rsquo;t judge him on that. But what we DO know is that his generation presided over these massive social changes we have seen in the past half century, and under their noses they ALLOWED them to happen. </p>

		<p>Blacks as a race generally have less of a conscience about honor or questions of a moral and philisophical ideas, than either occidentals or orientals.  </p>
<p>This is why their humor piviots on sadism and aggression (see any black comedian or black sitcom).  </p>
<p>This can be seen by their low suicide rates.  They simply don&rsquo;t get up in arms on moral or ethical questions which tend toward meloncholia.  They get up in arms about territory, authrority, and dominance, and this tends toward tremedous sensuousness.  Therefore, the rape numbers are higher among blacks.  This also explains why they rarely engage in serial killings.</p>
<p>Here is wisdom, when in public, never back down from a black, ever.  Unless you are out numbered or in an unsafe area.  If you do, they will attack.  Always resist the temptation to think that they have any qualms about honor, respect, or chivalry.  If opportunity presents itself for violence, they will take it without thinking (Rodney King).  They must be outwitted, thwarted, and thwacked, or they will become more bold.  Mostly, when they are met with a white or an asian who will not back down, they will usually not proceed, unless they are on drugs (as King was).  But this takes courage and love for Africans, many lack.</p>
<p>The only blacks who have a sence of this are the ones that are around lots of white people, as in the military.  But unfortunately, when around whites, blacks have a higher rate of suicide, and are more likely to engage in serial killing.</p>
<p>Obviously, this man blinked, and mistakenly assumed that blacks have a sence of chivalry.  Too bad for him, God have mercy on his soul.  </p>
<p>But, as Tammy Baker, the Wife of Evangelist (Screwball) Jimmy Baker, said, &#8220;the media is crazy, and needs help.&#8221;  The broader access Media promote fantastic ideas of racial equality that are hateful, dangerous, flippant, and down right unamerican.</p>

		<p>QD:  &#8220;Bravado? How can three young men ganging up and beating an elderly man to death be described with a word that reads anything like &#8216;bravery?&rsquo;&#8221;  The answer is simple: The RACIST MURDERER IS Brown (there is literally NO SUCH &#8216;THING&rsquo; AS A &#8220;BLACK&#8221; BIPEDAL HOMINID), the murder victim WAS White.</p>
<p>Bernie: &#8220;Think about it  &mdash;  ALL these attacks by blacks are either gang attacks, attacks on women, the elderly or much smaller men.&#8221;<br>
That&rsquo;s easy, and I literally mean this:  There ARE no White MEN for them to attack - LOOK.  LISTEN.  There literally ARE NOT ANY.  I am White, and I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY WHITE MALE EVER SAY ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO &#8220;BROWNS&#8221; NO MATTER WHAT - White women being raped, Brown-racist criminally violent &#8220;demonstrations&#8221; or overtly referenced &#8220;Race Riots,&#8221; e.g. LA, Cincinnati, you name it - it&rsquo;s ALWAYS &#8220;excused&#8221; as just &#8220;poor Blacks &#8216;getting even,&rsquo; just showing their anger at all the injustice,&#8221; etc, etc.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t attack what doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>White &#8220;hippies&#8221; generally are apolitical, and to the extent they are political they are pretty decent defenders of property and community and anything but the kind of bureaucratic personalities that gave us affirmative action.
