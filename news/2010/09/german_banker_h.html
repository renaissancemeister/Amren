<h1>German Banker Hits Nerve With Anti-Immigration Book</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Sturdee, AFP, September 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Politicians have rushed to condemn a board member of the German central bank for a new book tackling immigration, but his views have found considerable support among the population at large.</p>
<p>Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s book &#8220;is not convincing, but it has convinced many people,&#8221; said the influential Spiegel magazine, which this week has the Bundesbank executive on its cover, calling him a &#8220;people&rsquo;s hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>His publisher is rushing to print more copies of &#8220;Germany Does Itself In&#8221; to meet demand. Online retailer Amazon.de has a massive 207 reader reviews on its website, with the average score 4.4 stars out of a possible five.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left political party Sarrazin belongs to, has been inundated with thousands of letters, emails and phone calls attacking the central bank board&rsquo;s desire to expel him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to the voice of the people for once,&#8221; Spiegel quoted one of the almost 4,000 emails as saying.</p>
<p>In the book, Sarrazin says Europe&rsquo;s top economy is being undermined, overwhelmed and made &#8220;more stupid&#8221; by poorly educated, fast-breeding, badly integrated and unproductive Muslim immigrants and their offspring.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I want to hear the muezzin&rsquo;s call to prayer, then I&rsquo;ll go to the Orient,&#8221; he says, saying that allowing in millions of &#8220;guest workers&#8221; in the 1960s and 1970s was a &#8220;gigantic error.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also says that Turkish and Kurdish &#8220;clans&#8221; have a &#8220;long tradition of inbreeding,&#8221; leading to higher rates of birth defects, and ponders whether this might be one reason for immigrants&rsquo; poor school performance, Spiegel said.</p>
<p>This and his comment to a newspaper that &#8220;all Jews share a certain gene&#8221;, critics say, is akin to the kind of pseudo-science used by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel called the remarks &#8220;completely unacceptable.&#8221; The Bundesbank&rsquo;s board has asked President Christian Wulff to fire him, as it cannot do so itself.</p>
<p>Sarrazin has no intention of going quietly, however, and has threatened to appeal in the courts if Wulff dismisses him in a &#8220;show trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>But at the same time, Sarrazin&rsquo;s book has thrown the spotlight on the fact that Germany&rsquo;s record is poor on integrating its 15.6 million people with what the government calls &#8220;a migration background.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to official figures, nearly one in five young people without German nationality, which many second and third generation immigrants do not have, leave school with no qualifications.</p>
<p>Other figures show that people in Germany of Turkish origin, who number around three million and make up the largest minority, are significantly more likely to be living below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The debate has taken on such proportions that Merkel, 56, gave an interview to the Turkish daily Hurriyet, and on Sunday she admitted in the Bild am Sonntag weekly that Germany has made mistakes and has a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>In the past, Germany &#8220;dreamed a so-called multi-cultural dream and didn&rsquo;t do enough to remind immigrants of their responsibilities,&#8221; she told the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, it is true that children from immigrant families still today on average get worse grades at school.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our policies have made many things better but we still can&rsquo;t be satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a Pandora&rsquo;s Box has been opened. Backing for Sarrazin, 65, is so strong that a survey published on Sunday indicated that if he set up his own new political party, almost one in five (18 percent) would vote for him.</p>
<p>Sarrazin has no intention of doing any such thing, but the survey raised fears that a charismatic right-wing populist in Germany, like anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, could win considerable political support.</p>
<p>According to a study from Bielefeld University, one in two Germans thinks there are too many foreigners in the country.<br>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it is true that children from immigrant families still today on average get worse grades at school&hellip; . &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
That is because children from immigrant families have worse brains. Turks (and other Muslims/Middle-Easterners) simply AREN&rsquo;T AS SMART as Germans (and other whites/Europeans). </p>
<p>Less smart by quite a wide margin. </p>
<p>This has been demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt, over and over, in test after test. </p>
<p>And in country after country. </p>
<p>So, Fraulein Merkel, please be a good, pragmatic, reality-based German person and ACCEPT THIS FACT.</p>
<p>Then get to work on a good, pragmatic, reality-based German solution to the probelm: how to DEPORT all those brown-skinned underachievers that Herr Sarrazin is rightfully complaining about. </p>

		<p>At this time Sarrazin seems to have guts since he has not backed down. The points he makes about Muslim &#8216;guest workers&rsquo; is correct. Germans should start having kids and stop bringing in this mass of immigrants. Imagine Germany, along with France and the UK as Islamic Republics. It&rsquo;s not far fetched</p>

<p>These multicultural idiots, laughably make the inbred Muslims look like geniuses; if many people are convinced, then at some level the book is convincing. Or put another way, when the rest of the country sees things differently from your &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; it is time to either reevaluate that &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; or simply admit that stubborn madness is your standard for that &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Europe has a choice, thoroughly and unmercifully expel the Muslim invaders or be incrementally obliterated by them, at an ever increasing pace overtime . There is no multicultural &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; here; the crisis has hit a point where nearly 20% of Germany is now nonwhite &ldquo;guest workers.&rdquo; If that is not a call to awakening and arms, I do not know what is?</p>

<p>Er&hellip; isn&rsquo;t that a paradox?  How can a book that&rsquo;s &#8220;not convincing&#8221; have &#8220;convinced many people?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;allowing in millions of &ldquo;guest workers&rdquo; in the 1960s and 1970s was a &ldquo;gigantic error.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It sure was.  I was in high school during the Sixties, and even then I could see that this was a disaster in the making.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In the book, Sarrazin says Europe&rsquo;s top economy is being undermined, overwhelmed and made &ldquo;more stupid&rdquo; by poorly educated, fast-breeding, badly integrated and unproductive Muslim immigrants and their offspring.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh-oh. When anyone tells the truth that emphatically, it won&rsquo;t be long before the hysterical accusations of &#8220;Nazi&#8221; start coming thick and fast.  Oh, wait&hellip;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This and his comment to a newspaper that &ldquo;all Jews share a certain gene&rdquo;, critics say, is akin to the kind of pseudo-science used by the Nazis.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>What kind of &#8220;pseudo-science&#8221; would that be?  Isn&rsquo;t it called &#8220;genetics?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Chancellor Angela Merkel called the remarks &ldquo;completely unacceptable.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>But on the other hand&hellip;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;she admitted in the Bild am Sonntag weekly that Germany has made mistakes and has a lot of work to do.</i></p>

<p>Sorry, Angela.  I know you&rsquo;re backtracking and all, trying to pull your foot out of your mouth once you found out how many of the electorate are seeing through you, but you&rsquo;re still spouting the age-old leftist nonsense.  <i>Nothing</i> will &#8220;make things better, and you will <i>never</i> be satisfied.  Not even a &#8220;no Kinder left behind Act&#8221; will ever change those sows&rsquo; ears into silk purses.  Face the light, Angela   &mdash;   a new sun is rising.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;the survey raised fears that a charismatic right-wing populist in Germany&hellip;could win considerable political support.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And you can bet that the Usual Suspects will be working overtime, milking these &#8220;fears&#8221; (which don&rsquo;t seem to frighten the German people at all) for all they&rsquo;re worth.  Why, if such a horror occurs in Germany, it could spread to France&hellip;to England..and even to the United States!  Where will the multiculti globalist elites be able to hide, then?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;According to a study from Bielefeld University, one in two Germans thinks there are too many foreigners in the country.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And, considering the stringency of draconian European &#8220;anti-Hate&#8221; laws, I strongly suspect that figure to be far underestimated.</p>

<p>I wonder why all english language websources perpetuate the myth that all groups of immigrants in Germany underperform.<br>
There are groups like the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the Koreans, who are doing very very well in the German school system (better than Germans on average).<br>
Why are they always lumping all immigrants together?</p>

		<p>In these kinds of articles about immigration problems in Europe a couple of points keep getting made which are never explained properly. Talk of citizen responsibilities never gets elaborated. That&rsquo;s because responsibilities are a weak point in the modern world; there is no way to enforce them, define them, or reward them. The other point is that there are no simple fixes to bringing problem minorities to equality with the majority. Such groups are ethnic meaning they mostly associate with each other and thus keep their problems going within the group. Even if methods could be found to remedy the backward minorities, it would take several generations to reach equality. </p>

		<p>Yet another indicator that the world is waking up. One-in-five people saying they would vote for someone like this is VERY encouraging, and one-in-two saying that there are &#8220;Too many foreigners&#8221; in Germany just tickles me pink. I didn&rsquo;t like the &#8220;Jew gene&#8221; comment, but maybe he was simply talking about how Jews have breed themselves into intellectual superiority, instead of the Neo-Nazi sort of comment that the article was inplying he made.</p>

		<p>Moron critics. Jews do share a &#8220;certain&#8221; gene. Intelligence. Overall, it benefits Jews and the societies they live in. Unlike Muslims, Jews can take most criticism without blowing up their critics. Hitler made a huge strategic mistake by expelling Jews from German society as he took on Communism. The Germans continued this mistake by including moronic Turks and Africans in their contemporary society. It is not a Holocaust to keep undesireables out.</p>

<p>Germany needs to think about long and hard about that decision they made, and those who support Sarrazin should also support an open and honest debate about that history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same history in practically every white European majority country and it has created the same nightmare everywhere: multiculturalism and the decline of white European cultures and societies.</p>
<p>Any honest and open debate has to acknowledge the mistakes that were made and what their effects have been. There has been an inadvertent but very real coalition of efforts between a wealthy elite addicted to cheap labor and a cultural elite that has used these exploited minorities as a way to advance their cause of tearing down white society, culture and tradition in the name of &#8220;social justice.&#8221; White European countries must end their addiction to cheap labor. It has to be admitted that multiculturalism has failed and that it threatens the very existence of white people, or at the very least, it threatens the ability of white people to self-determination. </p>
<p>I hope that Sarrazin is able to pierce the wall of politically correct speech codes in order to give Germans a chance to consider these questions.</p>

		<p>I am an American living in Germany, I must say, since Sarrazin opened his mouth, German politics has become interesting for the very first time!!</p>
<p>the elites here are terrified, for Sarrazin is at the moment far and away the most popular public figure in the country.</p>
<p>by stating inconvenient facts so bluntly, Sarrazin has opened up the space for Chancellor Merkel and others to say very similar things in more measured tones. </p>
<p>in private, I suspect that Chancellor Merkel is thanking him for getting this discussion going at long last.</p>
<p>the vast majority of German Muslims are comparable in terms of mental ability to the underclass of Germans.</p>
<p>this German underclass in the second unspeakably horrible problem facing Germany:<br>
bred over the past half-century by excessively generous social programs, it consists of people who are not intelligent for any but the most menial and mindless jobs, and most of them collect more in social benefits that may contribute in economic activity.</p>
<p>between the German underclass and the Muslim immigrants, Germany is headed for catastrophe.</p>
<p>unfortunately what is needed is a frank discussion of genetics, eugenics, intelligence, and mental ability going light-years beyond Sarrazin. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. The Turks coming to Germany weren&rsquo;t exactly the intellectual cream of their country. The educated Turks remain mostly at home or emigrate in a different pattern. <br>
The migrants to Germany came from rather backward villages in Antalya. <br>
At first these migrant workers and their children were taught German by simply watching TV. However, satellite TV and constant import of village cousins for marriages ended this and now there are whole enclaves, where one can live w/o using a single German word the whole day. <br>
There was a study saying that the recent generation of immigrant kids entering schools is less capable to speak and understand German than the former generations!</p>

		<p>I find it interesting that Mr. Sarrazin is 65 years old. I have noticed where I work, older people near the verge of retirement are much more vocal than younger people about their opposition to third world immigration, Islamic headscarves, etc. As one man said to me, he can retire now if he wants and still get his pension, so there&rsquo;s no sin in speaking out against multiculturalism, as well as internal corporate inefficiency. In some respects, it&rsquo;s older people, not younger people, who are more prepared to &#8216;shake the system&rsquo; these days.</p>

		<p>Sarrazin could have made a much stronger case against Muslim immgration if he he had just stated flat out the he opposes Muslim immigration because they are not German. Instead he made an economic case against Muslim immigration which is not nearly as a strong as the the tribal-racial case against muslim immigration.</p>
<p>European Elites could easily respond:&#8221;Let&rsquo;s start pumping in lot&rsquo;s of Asians into Germany because Asians are industrious and score high on IQ tests&#8221;. And for all we know, Sarrazin might just go along with this. And as a consequence, the Germans in Germany get race replaced by Asians or some other nonwhite group.</p>
<p>Of course, if Sarrazin made the case against Muslim immigration this way, European Elites would have gone ballistic. But this would have been a wonderfull thing, for it would have given the race-replacement issue a whole lot of free publicity thereby raising public awareness about the issue of rapid rce-replacement.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sarrazin&rsquo;s book has thrown the spotlight on the fact that Germany&rsquo;s record is poor on integrating its 15.6 million people with what the government calls &ldquo;a migration background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is classic misdirection by the media. The problem is not that Germany&rsquo;s record is poor. The real problem is that the record of the immigrants is poor. They will never assimilate, whether they are in Germany, the US, or the UK.</p>

		<p>It is good to see the stirring of nationalist feelings throughout much of Europe (Except for say England? France?, they are truely lost!..I hope I&rsquo;m wrong!). Right wing parties are gaining strength across much of the continent (mostly in central &amp; eastern Europe)&hellip;It makes one wonder when it is our turn?!!. Germany is some 91-92% ethnic German &amp; 4% &#8220;other&#8221; white European. It&rsquo;s &#8220;non-European&#8221; population is only 4-5% (with a moslem population at 3.7%)&hellip;They are already starting to see a rise in nationalism &amp; a backlash against their changing demographic.  We in the good ole USA on the other hand are at 34% non-European &amp; we blindly continue to bury our collective heads in the sand &amp; raise not a peep!! (as does ALL of the English speaking world!)&hellip;.IF we do not wake up, and SOON!. ALL will be lost &amp; any future descendants will curse us for all time!.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t Jews share the Cohen gene?  Isn&rsquo;t that the gene that allegedly proves that the Ashkenazi Jews had an ancestor who came from Israel or Judea several centuries ago.  Isn&rsquo;t that gene the whole reason they claim the right to be there when they plainly look very little like Arab Jews and the Palestinian Arabs?  So then why is Sarrazin being Antisemitic if he alludes to it?  I guess that is an elite poison pill to make him look like a Nazi since he disagrees with them letting in millions of Muslims (whose Koran says Kill the Jews) to live off the dole and vote to keep them in power into perpetuity.</p>
<p>Germany needs to expel the Muslims back to their native lands. They claim they all want to live under Shariah rule anyway, and there is no place better than one that has already established it.  Germans don&rsquo;t need Muslim &#8220;workers.&#8221; They have a high unemployment rate over there.  The best way to fix that is get rid of the Muslims, cut off welfare, and put their own people back to work.<br>

<p>The writer seldom examines the alleged fears and comments on the number of people gripped by them, or questions their validity. It&rsquo;s a cheap way to get emotional words into the story to sway the reader without presenting an argument.

<p>The msm is an enemy to Whites  &mdash;  ingrain that into your psyche.

<p>The msm repeat stories, ad infinitum, of &#8216;poor, beleaguered non-White immigrants seeking a better life and their fair share of the American pie.&rsquo;  If we Whites complain about this Third World Welfare Flood into our homelands we are axiomatically called Nazis and put our livelihoods in danger.</p>
<p>For example, for stating the obvious:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Bundesbank&rsquo;s board has asked President Christian Wulff to fire Sarrazin, as it cannot do so itself&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So let me ask this:  Why are you, as a White, purchasing or subscribing to a business, therefore supporting it monetarily, that despises you and actively seeks and promotes your demise?</p>
<p>I hope the government conducts a show trial of Sarrazin  &mdash;   at the moment, the numbers are in his favor.  In a few short years they won&rsquo;t be and any dissent such as from Sarrazin will be eliminated, enemies of the state like Sarrazin, disappeared.</p>

<p>They are the ones who bequeathed to us this crumbling shell of a formerly-great country, because they were more interested in the pursuit of wealth, status, free love, divorce-on-demand and all the other rotten fruits of self-centered greed than they were in the maintenance of their proud legacy.</p>

<p>I would have thought that people  getting very &#8220;near the verge of retirement&#8221; would be much more cautious.  They don&rsquo;t want to throw everything away at the last moment.  AFTER retirement, they can say what they want.  Of course, someone with 65 years of living and experience behind him can remember Germany as it once was, which the younger cannot.</p>
<p>His name &#8220;Sarazin&#8221; interests me. It is not a German name. There are several possible sources [including Saracen/Saracino, and Sara&rsquo;s son]. I&rsquo;ll venture a guess that he could be of French Huguenot origin. Germany has many prominent and influential families of Huguenot descent who had fled the persecutions in France. They have assimilated very well, but this outsider&rsquo;s background gives them a second and broader perspective that most Germans do not have.</p>

		<p>When I was stationed in Germany in the 70&rsquo;s, I noted the Turks and other &#8216;guest workers&rsquo;, and I asked my friend if he wasn&rsquo;t concerned. He admitted he didn&rsquo;t like having so many of them but they were &#8216;controlled&rsquo; and, he said, &#8216;we need them&hellip;what else can we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I think much of the guest worker binge started when the Berlin wall was set up, cutting off a large source of German labor, another example of how the postwar division severely hurt Germany.</p>
<p>No one like the Turks or other foreigners. They are imposed on Germany, and to remove them now would probably mean a war, one throughout Europe since all the other non-white peoples would go as well. It&rsquo;s always the corporate ruling class that brings in cheap labor, assisted by leftists who are self-hating whites.<br>
Since the EU, Europe is a less free place.</p>

&ldquo;If I want to hear the muezzin&rsquo;s call to prayer, then I&rsquo;ll go to the Orient,&rdquo; he says, saying that allowing in millions of &ldquo;guest workers&rdquo; in the 1960s and 1970s was a &ldquo;gigantic error.&rdquo;<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>To paraphrase someone above,  there has been an international coalition  (inadvertent, perhaps, but nonetheless very real) between a financial elite addicted to cheap labor and a cultural/ideological elite who have used these minorities as a means to advance their own cause of tearing down white society and civilization&hellip;in the lofty name of &ldquo;social justice.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s putting it very well, and in a nutshell. <br>
I could add that Turks, being just about the whitest and most European of the Moslems   &mdash;   thus  the most acceptable and least noticeable   &mdash;    were the prime choice as   Trojan horses &hellip; to get a foot in the door and thus start the  process of de-whitening Central Europe and multi-racializing it.  After them, with their numbers established and local resistance weakened, could come the Arabs, then the Pakistanis, Chinese, etc., etc., and finally the Africans. Step by step.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was planned this way intentionally, but if not,  it might as well have been.  If it was, then this is a long-term project, conceived by persons with patience and a broad historical view,  and coordinated with events going on elsewhere in ALL white countries today.  If it is a mere accident, it&rsquo;s extraordinary.</p>

		<p>Merci,  François. So I thought.  As I understand, Sarazin could also be given to a person who had been on a Crusade. Certainly there were many French people involved in the Crusades who would have qualified, as the Crusades were mainly of French inspiration.  </p>
<p>How different it was from the mood in France now. Mon dieu! I wonder how the Crusades are taught in today&rsquo;s French schools? Are they covered up? Is history revised?  Do they wallow in guilt?  What is taught of Charles Martel and St. Louis the King?  Are they discretely forgotten to appease the new Moslem masses (and avoid rioting)?  </p>
<p>And what about Joan of Arc, driving out the foreigners and preserving France for the French?  Is she considered a bad example?  How awkward.  Take down all those statues!  Heavens, they might &#8220;offend&#8221; someone.  And I don&rsquo;t mean the English.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see some of  those new textbooks in the schools. It must be a very difficult job for the writers to juggle so many ethnic sensibilities    &mdash;   from Algerians to Cambodians   &mdash;   and make everyone &#8220;feel good about themselves&#8221;.

<p>Better make &#8220;several centuries ago&#8221; nearly two thousand years ago.  The Jews who settled in the Rhinelands did so soon after the second century dispersion of the Jews of Judea after the Second War of the Jewish Rebellion, aka The Bar Kokhba Revolt.  The locals welcomed them largely because they had not learned Christian induced anti-Semitism, and they brought trade to the region.  They mixed in but remained Jewish by faith.  This enlarged after the fall of Rome.  By the time of the Normans for example, Duke William of Normandy, as well as French King Henry 1 used Jewish merchants, accountants, etc., in building their kingdoms and making them prosperous.  The only medical school in Europe was at Montepellar in Southern France which was staffed almost entirely by Jewish physicians.  Jews could move freely between Christian and Muslim worlds, providing Europe with lifelines that made for example, Marco Polo&rsquo;s travels possible. A Jewish banker to Ferdinand and Isabella made Columbus&rsquo; voyage possible.  Pressures from Rome beginning in the 12th century saw some expulsions take place, as well as indebted kings who learned that they could confiscate all Jewish money and property with the churches support.  But today&rsquo;s lingering anti-Jewish tendencies have most of their roots in the 14th century and the era of the black plague, when nearly everyone was suspected, but Jews most often, famously accused of poisoning wells.  It was after this time that Jews became a far more closed community in Europe where before intermarriages were common.  In fact, an honest review of European history reveals that Jews were a main cause, if not THE main cause for Europe&rsquo;s ascendancy and later success.  </p>
<p>DNA studies show a &#8220;Jewish&#8221; genome markers on alleles 12% of the time in the general German &#8220;non-Jewish&#8221; population.  One has to wonder what Hitler would have done if he had access to dna analysis.</p>
