			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, September 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 28-year-old woman who said an unknown assailant threw a cup of caustic liquid in her face has admitted her injuries were self-inflicted, Vancouver, Washington, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>Bethany Storro was being interviewed by detectives, and whether she will be charged will be up to prosecutors, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is extremely upset,&#8221; said police Commander Marla Schuman. &#8220;She is very remorseful. In many ways it got bigger than she expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police would not speculate on Storro&rsquo;s motives, only saying the August 30 incident did not occur as she described and that there were discrepancies in her account, including wearing sunglasses in the evening.</p>
<p>They also had questions about the liquid&rsquo;s splash patterns on Storro&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Officers acquired a search warrant and conducted a search Thursday morning. They removed several undisclosed items, but said they did not find a substance that might have caused her injuries.</p>
<p>Vancouver had searched for an assailant, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail.</p>
<p>Storro was released from an Oregon hospital on September 5 after undergoing surgery for her injuries after the alleged attack.</p>
<p>Police spent hundreds of hours on the case and the community came together to offer donations for Storro&rsquo;s treatment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Storro told KATU that she had stopped at a Vancouver Starbucks about 7:15 p.m., just after she had gone back to buy a pair of sunglasses that she had seen earlier. The woman walked up to her and said, &#8220;Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Storro declined, the woman threw the contents of the cup in her face and ran off, Storro claimed at the time.</p>

		<p>And now we will hear nonstop whining from the black community about how Whitey is always trying to blame them for everything,one of them being the case where the white mother of two drove her SUV with her kids inside into a lake, and said that she was carjacked by a black.It happens bolth ways, and blacks are the leaders when it comes to racial hoaxes.</p>

		<p>Although I can see how the splash pattern on this woman&rsquo;s face looks suspicious (she was wearing sunglasses by the way), I am FAR more predisposed to think that she was attacked and then her life threatened by police, forcing her to recant than I believe she did this to herself.</p>
<p>Intense pain.  Possibility of blindness.  Probability of permanent disfigurement.  Unless she is a schizophrenic suffering a psychotic break, there is simply no way she did this to herself.</p>
<p>And shame on whites for believing this.  Haven&rsquo;t you seen enough anti-white hate crime sanitized out of the news?  Haven&rsquo;t you seen enough of police and courts that let non-whites off simply because their victims are white?  You better wake up and smell the marxism because our country passed idiot leftism a long, looooong time ago.  Genocide and ethnic cleansing against whites have been common since WWII.</p>
<p>This reminds me of that case with the woman who was attacked for having an anti-Obama bumper sticker.  She too &#8220;recanted&#8221; and somehow caused the serious injuries to her own face.  Don&rsquo;t you believe it for a second.  These women were threatened and not by random thugs&hellip;.but gangsters who work for a corrupt anti-white local government.  One of the more extreme examples of why it is all important where you live.</p>

		<p>All the news stations are in a dither that she fingered a black woman as her attacker. Funny thing is, those same stations never mentioned the race fictional attacker in the first place. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  </p>

		<p>Talk about a self-hating Caucasian. I don&rsquo;t know why she did this to herself, quite frankly, but how is she any different from the self-hating Caucasians who voted for Obama? Did she not think of the consequences - disfigurement for life, being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; (which she surely will be, since she tried to blame a black woman), and people wondering if she has mental disorders. I have no sympathy for her, whatsoever. It debases every woman who is the real victim of an interracial attack.</p>

		<p>This fool deserves the same condemnation that minorities who perpetrate hate crime hoaxes deserve, but so seldom get. The coverage will illustrate several things though:.</p>
<p>1. Notice how in the original story of the attack, the description of the alleged attacker as a black woman was typically at the end of the story or not included at all. Now that it has been revealed the attack was the hoax the fact that she blamed a black woman is now up at the front of most stories in the first or second paragraph and has been made a central aspect of the story.</p>
<p>2. Notice that coverage of the hoax is getting national attention on every major media outlet, whereas hoaxes perpetrated by minorites blaming a white are buried in the back of local news section of metro papers. Almost never are they given national coverage when the hoax is revealed.</p>
<p>3. A black man was arrested today for an acid attack on his ex-girlfriend in a Minneapolis suburb today. No mention what race she was but his picture was on the TV news but not in the online version of the newspaper. So it looks like blacks have picked up on this tactic as a copycat crime even though the original black perpetrator has turned out to be fictitious.</p>
<p>4. There seems to be no real danger of anybody being attacked with acid by a white person, unless that white (or partially white) person and the victim are one and the same.</p>

What makes me angry is that there are many legitimate violent black on white hate crimes that are ignored by the media.</p>
<p>Why was the media so quick to turn this one into a national headline? Did they have inside information that it was a hoax?</p>

I, along with most people on here, believed the original story of this being a black-on-white attack when it was first reported. I was among the commenters expressing sympathy for the victim and anger for the attacker. </p>
<p>Now that it has been revealed to be a white hoaxer (yes, they DO exist), I feel duped by this woman. And annoyed, too. Because beyond having deceived the public, this Bethany Storro has also spread the idea to an angry and irresponsible African-American population that you can throw acid in a white woman&rsquo;s face and get away with it, thereby encouraging copycat crimes. </p>
<p>Now we are told that Ms. Storro is actually just some sort of self-mutilating nutcase who made up the fictitious (but plausible sounding) black female attacker out of her own sick mind. This sort of stupid stunt does none of us, black or white, any good. </p>
<p>But I commend AmRen for running this item just the same. Even though the revelation of the hoax tends to make us, as White Advocates, look a little hasty in our willingness to condemn black criminality (which in this case apparently didn&rsquo;t exist), it&rsquo;s good for us to air our racial dirty laundry like this once in a while. </p>
<p>One of the milder criticisms of AR is that they &#8220;cherry pick&#8221; their news stories to show minorities in a relentlessly bad light. And for the most part, this is true, AR does do this   &mdash;   just as the MSM cherry-picks news stories to do the opposite! AR&rsquo;s enemies say that this &#8220;bias&#8221; in the news items the site chooses every day gives an unfair, distorted picture of nonwhites. That when it comes to race, AR always &#8220;accentuates the negative.&#8221; Well, the fact that AR has run this &#8220;retraction&#8221; of sorts proves that&rsquo;s NOT TRUE! </p>
<p>Had Mr. Taylor and company swept today&rsquo;s reversal under the rug   &mdash;   as they could easily have done   &mdash;   I for one would probably never hear that the whole Bethany Storro story was a fake. It is to AR&rsquo;s credit that they are willing to pursue truth   &mdash;   Jeffersonian, capital-T Truth   &mdash;   regardless of who comes out looking good or who comes out looking bad. </p>
<p>But then, that&rsquo;s the difference between white people and&hellip; well, the difference between white people and just about every other color of people, isn&rsquo;t it? We&rsquo;re the only ones to subject ourselves to self-criticism.  </p>

<p>Likewise, one could criticize McDonalds for cherry picking news stories that show Taco Bell, KFC, Arby&rsquo;s and Burger King in a bad light.  Really, I don&rsquo;t think the purpose of AR&rsquo;s daily story selection has anything to do with bad lights or negativity, my guess is that the AR website editors are working hard to rebuke the notion that &#8220;there&rsquo;s no such thing as race,&#8221; or &#8220;race is a social construct,&#8221; using the lamestream media&rsquo;s own stories mostly.</p>

		<p>The fact that this particular case has turned out to be a hoax has been the talk of the news today  &mdash;  from EVERY station here in Washington state. This highlights a real news problem. REAL black on white crime is just &#8220;business as usual&#8221; and hardly gets a blip, if that, in the daily news. The fact that acid was used in this story made it go nationwide for about 15 minutes. ONE mention was all I heard. Now that it has been revealed as a hoax the coverage is relentless and truly nationwide. This will be brought up for years now, every time a white woman is truly victimized by a non-white. </p>

<p>Yeah. When a non-white commits a hoax, the community rallies around the cause anyway. Cause it just shows what could have happened and it is a good opportunity to examine hate. Or a teachable-moment as it&rsquo;s called now. </p>

		<p>I think she was frightened by the media attention her story garnered. This attack probably did happen and her attacker is still out there and anonymous, most likely never to be caught. The police won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t help her. What would you do? This is probably her best way to be able to go back to having a private life.</p>

		<p>Well, I did think the woman was the victim of a racial hate attack. Sounded plausible to me.</p>
<p>There have been others like this. That guy in Boston who had his wife killed by the brother-in-law and claimed a black did it.</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read, most hate crime hoaxes don&rsquo;t involve bodily injury but something much milder such as graffiti, vandalism or a threatening letter / email. Even when an assault is alleged the &#8220;evidence&#8221; is usually limited to dirt or a few scratches.</p>
<p>So one shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad they took this woman at her word. Nor should one be too quick to dismiss it as a hoax, either. Rather, I&rsquo;d recommend a cautious &#8220;wait and see&#8221; attitude. That might not be a bad idea for future incidents as well. After all, occasionally a man does bite a dog rather than the other way around.</p>

		<p>I usually watch Fox News in the evening, but switch to MSNBC or CNN during commercials.  On CNN, Rick &#8220;The Twit&#8221; Sanchez was shouting so loudly about the acid-throwing woman that I had to mute my TV!  After Anderson Cooper came on, all I saw on CNN(during Fox Commercials) were photos of the two rape-murder white men who slaughtered a family and burned down the house.  Now how many blacks have done the same?  And, of course, neither CNN nor MSNBC would ever mention the Witchita Massacre or Knoxville Horror!</p>

<p>But whites ARE to blame for all the racial problems we have in America, whether they are directly or indirectly to blame for those racial problems.</p>
<p>Whites are nearly 70 percent of the population, and they are over 80 percent of the voters. California may have a non-white majority when we factor in the mestizo illegals, but whites remain a majority of voters in California.</p>
<p>Whites have the political power to stop non-white immigration to America. They simply need to demand the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, and station those troops on the US-Mexico border. Whites have the political power to pass laws that are extremely harsh on violent criminals. The fact that whites allow minorities to commit crimes against them, and fail to use their political power to punish minority criminals severely, means that whites are indirectly responsible for the crimes that minorities are committing against them. White people have the political power to fix America. It is time that white people started acting like responsible and mature citizens, in order to safeguard the future of civilization in America.</p>

		<p>I read that it was a do-it-yourself chemical peel that went wrong, so she decided to shift the blame onto an anonymous black person.  That explanation corresponds with the photo of her with burns very neatly on her cheeks &amp; forehead, just like a peel, not like acid thrown wildly.  Also, the police drawing of the suspect didn&rsquo;t look remotely black. </p>
<p>Apparently cops can tell almost immediately when a story doesn&rsquo;t add up.   They should throw her in jail at least for a while, wasting everyone&rsquo;s time &amp; sympathy.</p>

<p>I am amazed at the number of posters here who have unquestioningly accepted her as white. Have we now gotten to the point where (like Brazil) anyone with  some white blood is considered &#8220;white&#8221;?</p>
<p>The name,  Storro, as I would take it, is Spanish. On the West Coast that would suggest Mexican or Philipino. I note that she and her mother do not share the same name. Interesting, that. This woman is racially borderline. Look at her eyes; they are not Caucasian.  Is she, like so many West Coast hybrids, a vague mixture of this and that, which her mother got out of the grab-bag? </p>
<p>I know another white person when I see one.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, my position is that if it&rsquo;s necessary  to guess whether someone is white or not &hellip;  then they&rsquo;re NOT.</p>

<p> Actually, it is a Scandinavian name, fairly common (at least not rare) in the Pacific northwest.</p>

<p>Interesting case, and one that bears further examination. In all such cases, one should assume no crime until proven guilty in a court of law.</p>

But I commend AmRen for running this item just the same. Even though the revelation of the hoax tends to make us, as White Advocates, look a little hasty in our willingness to condemn black criminality (which in this case apparently didn&rsquo;t exist), it&rsquo;s good for us to air our racial dirty laundry like this once in a while.</p>
<p>Amen!<br>

<p>No. We are too quick to label people like this as WHITE! We need to do a little research on these people and see exactly what race/nationality she really is. This is what we should do with all &#8220;White&#8221; traitors, so to speak.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder if this young woman was adopted.  I suspect it.</p>
<p>I saw only one picture of her parents. They appear to be very supportive and loving. However, they do not  resemble her in any way. It was very interesting to note that they are also much lighter than she is, clearly Caucasian, with a German name: Neuwelt.  Her &#8220;mother&#8221; is a blonde, not resenbling Bethany ethnically at all.</p>
<p>Darker parents could have a lighter child, but light parents would not have a dark child. In short, there is something very strange about that whole family picture. Something just doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;fit&#8221; right.</p>

		<p>I tend to agree with #3.  Police are adept, now, at getting forced confessions.  And doped-up with pain medications, I&rsquo;m sure Storro was easy to manipulate.</p>
<p>We all remember Katrina, don&rsquo;t we?  The freezer in the Superdome full of bodies&hellip;. then we&rsquo;re told there were no bodies at all&hellip; just a hoax&hellip;.like the news broadcasts we&rsquo;d been hearing for a solid week were just fiction&hellip;but, oddly, cameramen were not allowed into the freezer to photograph the absence of bodies&hellip; Now why might that be?  The sight of an empty freezer might endanger&hellip;what?  More likely it was chock-full-o&rsquo;-bodies: but the coverup had started.</p>
<p>So, yeah: I can see orders from on-high, coming down to squelch the victimization of this almost-White woman.  Last thing the White Genocide Agenda needs is for Whites to wake up before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>My local station which never carries a Black-on-White story like this spent several minutes airing this hoax. I thought to myself about all the Black hoaxes which are totally ignored by our ruling media. It would be quite informative if Amren did a story of the Black hoaxes such as the Tawanna Brawley case.</p>

		<p>I applaud AR for posting this follow-up. Which proves they truly believe in the Thomas Jefferson quote they proudly display under American Renaissance.com.</p>
<p>I too believed this story and commented under the original post. While I stand by original statements, I do believe this was a hoax. </p>
<p>I know some people commenting here are having a hard time believing this was a hoax and feel she may have been coerced. Remember the Susan Smith case? When it was finally found out that she drove her own sons into the lake and drowned them? This woman wasn&rsquo;t forced to recant. There are a lot of mentally ill people out there. </p>
<p>If this wasn&rsquo;t done for monetary gain, she could very well have a mental disease called Munchausins Syndrome. It seems to fit. </p>

		<p>Mike Harrigan and others who are still in denial about whether this was a hoax. &#8220;The hoax was a hoax.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Californian and some other posters have stated, sometimes we have to admit the fact that some of our fellow White brethern Whites do commit hoaxes as well. We do ourselves no good in trying to resort to &#8220;explanations&#8221; such as &#8220;she&rsquo;s not all that White&#8221;, &#8220;The police probably made her recant her story &#8221; and other highly unlikely, absurd arguments.</p>
<p>She needs to be prosecuted.</p>
