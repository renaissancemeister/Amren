		<p>Most of these &#8216;suspects&rsquo; are either Chinese or Korean. The focus on the immigration crisis seems to be centered on all the dusky peasants coming here from Latin America but people from all over the world are taking part in the raping and pillaging of this country. Chinese and Indians are now the fasted growing groups of illegals. And this visa scam for residency by orientals is an example the how the invasion in happening from all sides.</p>

		<p>I get so weary, seeing nothing but immigrants all day long.  When I meet an old-line WASP it is such a rarity.  I wonder how the average thinking Roman felt as the barbarians chipped away at the empire, and then it came close to his own area.</p>

		<p>As Pat Buchanan has observed,the issue isn&rsquo;t just illegal immigrants,it&rsquo;s legal immigration and all its loopholes too. Even if marriages aren&rsquo;t fake, or people really are related and qualify for green cards because relatives are legal residents here,nonetheless, the influx must stop. The student visas, the &#8220;business&#8221; visas that aren&rsquo;t short selling trips but permanent business residences, the family &#8216;reunifications&rsquo;. Yes, stop the illegals from working, stop them from obtaining health, education and other benefits. Speed up their deportations for sure.</p>
<p>But the one million plus per year who immigrate legally change our culture more permanently than illegals who keep to themselves and don&rsquo;t get involved in political and community action. This legal, socalled, immigration should stop too, and for a long long time. We are stuffed. And we can&rsquo;t digest them all. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an immigration rule that says if you have around $500,000 to &#8216;invest&rsquo; in America, you can come right over and become a citizen. There&rsquo;s a rumor that, like &#8216;chain immigration&rsquo;, the same &#8216;$500,000&rsquo; is allowing numerous immigrants to move to the US. The money is moved from the account of someone who has already immigrated, to another person back home who wants to immigrate and who now has &#8216;500,000&rsquo; to invest. I was actually told this by an Asian. Asian&rsquo;s are probably the only group that can stick to the agreement and not run off with the money. </p>

<p>I dislike that &#8220;romans vs barbarians&#8221; analogy. Remember, our ancestors (at least if you&rsquo;re germanic) were those &#8220;barbarians&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Almost all those East Asian criminals have white first names like Jane Kim and Richie Le.  East Asians have a fondness for the milky white names.  I went to school with an obese Korean girl named Rebecca but she liked being called Becky.</p>
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg in East Asian criminality.  East Asians generally don&rsquo;t do flashy, implusive, violent, personal crime that translates well for television like black people do so people don&rsquo;t know how extensive criminal activity like tax evasion, human trafficking and spying are with East Asians.  The crimes East Asians are in to are those that undermine systems.  I can only imagine how long and how many East Asians were involved in this crime ring.</p>
