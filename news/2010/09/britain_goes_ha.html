			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Mcgee and Martin Delgado, Daily Mail (London), September 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mail on Sunday investigation  &mdash;  which will alarm anyone concerned about animal cruelty  &mdash;  has revealed that schools, hospitals, pubs and famous sporting venues such as Ascot and Twickenham are controversially serving up meat slaughtered in accordance with strict Islamic law to unwitting members of the public.</p>
<p>All the beef, chicken and lamb sold to fans at Wembley has secretly been prepared in accordance with sharia law, while Cheltenham College, which boasts of its &#8216;strong Christian ethos&rsquo;, is one of several top public schools which also serves halal chicken to pupils without informing them.</p>
<p>Even Britain&rsquo;s biggest hotel and restaurant group Whitbread, which owns the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre chains, among many others, has admitted that more than three-quarters of its poultry is halal.</p>
<p>Animal welfare campaigners have long called for a ban on the traditional Islamic way of preparing meat  &mdash;  which involves killing animals by drawing a knife across their throats, without stunning them first  &mdash;  saying it is cruel and causes unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Sharia law expressly forbids knocking the animal out with a bolt gun, as is usual in British slaughter_houses. Instead, it must be sentient when its throat is cut, and the blood allowed to drip from the carcass while a religious phrase in praise of Allah is recited.</p>
<p>The extent of halal meat consumption, even in areas of Britain with a very small Muslim population, was revealed as the Pope, on his first visit to Britain, expressed fears that the country was not doing enough to preserve traditional Christian values and customs.</p>
<p>In a strongly worded speech to Parliament, he said: &#8216;There are those who argue that the public celebration of festivals such as Christmas should be discouraged, in the questionable belief that it might somehow offend those of other religions or none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it is animal rights groups which have been most vociferous in their opposition to halal slaughter. Campaign organisation Viva!, whose supporters include Heather Mills and Joanna Lumley, said in a statement: &#8216;Other practices which may be undertaken for religious reasons, such as polygamy or the stoning of adulterers, are not permitted in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8216;Religious freedom does not override other moral considerations and the suffering caused by this form of slaughter is so severe that it cannot be allowed to prevent action to be taken. Consumers can do their bit by boycotting places that persist in selling meat from unstunned animals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An RSPCA spokesman added: &#8216;The public have a right to know how their meat is produced. Many people are extremely concerned about animal welfare. What The Mail on Sunday has discovered shows that people are not being kept informed. The key to a more humane death for these animals is that they are stunned before slaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Twickenham, which sells only halal chicken despite not advertising the fact, insisted that the lack of transparency &#8216;had never been an issue&rsquo; and said: &#8216;Our consideration is more for those who want halal, to ensure they get it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other institutions secretly serving up meat that is halal  &mdash;  or &#8216;permissible&rsquo;  &mdash;  include Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and one of London&rsquo;s biggest NHS Trusts, Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the London hospitals admitted: &#8216;The only way people using the canteen would know they were eating halal chicken would be if they asked a member of staff directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman for the London hospitals added: &#8216;The chicken we use is stunned before it is killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whitbread, which also owns Table Table restaurants, Costa Coffee shops and Premier Inn hotels, admitted last night that 80 per cent of the chicken it served comes from halal poultry suppliers, including some in Muslim-dominated Turkey.</p>
<p>A Whitbread spokesman said: &#8216;We don&rsquo;t specify halal as a requirement in our procurement. We base our decision on quality and price.</p>
<p>&#8216;It just turns out that we source that amount of chicken from suppliers that happen to be halal.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is not mentioned on any of our menus because we don&rsquo;t think there is customer demand for that information. But if people started asking, then we would definitely provide it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rival operator Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which owns the Harvester, Browns and Toby Carvery restaurant chains as well as pub chains All Bar One and O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s, was even more opaque about the source of its meats.</p>
<p>A spokesman said it had a &#8216;broad range of suppliers&rsquo; but declined to say how many were halal-certified.</p>
<p>Ascot racecourse said it was easier to store and cook only one type of meat. &#8216;All our chicken is halal. This is not advertised as the menus are kept as simple as possible,&rsquo; said a spokesman.</p>
<p>A Football Association spokesman confirmed: &#8216;All the beef, chicken and lamb sold at Wembley Stadium is halal which means a large proportion of the meat on offer to our customers falls into this category.&rsquo; Pork, which is forbidden to Muslims, is also served at the stadium.</p>
<p>Cheltenham College boarding school in Gloucestershire admitted: &#8216;We have not sent a letter, nor is there any note on menus that informs parents and pupils that the chicken served in the canteen is mostly halal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, admitted that while halal chicken is usually served only to Muslims, it had &#8216;occasionally&rsquo; served it to all pupils. The school refused to say whether parents and pupils had been informed.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Muslim community is exempt from regulations that require animals to be stunned before death, as is kosher meat prepared for the Jewish market.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t object to people of different religious groups being catered for but it&rsquo;s not something that should be imposed on everybody else.</p>
<p>&#8216;The vast majority of people in this country would not want meat of this origin. The outlets have a duty to let their customers know because some will object very strongly, not least because of the animal welfare implications of halal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said: &#8216;We suspected that meat killed by the halal and kosher methods was being used for general consumption but we never imagined it was so widespread. It is disgraceful that people aren&rsquo;t being told if the food they are being served is from meat that has not been stunned prior to slaughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2003, Government advisory body the Farm Animal Welfare Council published a report declaring that the halal method of killing &#8216;would inevitably trigger a barrage of sensory information to the brain in a sensible (conscious) animal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Experts who contributed to the report concluded that &#8216;such a massive injury would result in very significant pain and distress in the period before insensibility supervenes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Muslim leaders insist that animal welfare measures are observed during slaughter. Guidelines issued by the Islamic Cultural Centre in London state that &#8216;no stress or discomfort&rsquo; should be inflicted on the animal and that the knife must be sharp and clean.</p>
<p><b>Brutal reality of the ritual that allows animals to be slaughtered without being stunned first</b></p>
<p>More than 40&nbsp;million cattle, calves and sheep and more than 850&nbsp;million poultry are slaughtered every year in Britain.</p>
<p>The vast majority are stunned before slaughter but UK law allows the Jewish and Muslim communities to kill animals by religious methods without any form of stunning.</p>
<p>A number of requirements have been put in place, however, in an attempt to reduce animal suffering.</p>
<p>The rules state that the throat must be cut with one rapid, uninterrupted movement of the knife. Both carotid arteries and both jugular veins must be severed.</p>
<p>In addition, the knife must be inspected before each animal is slaughtered to ensure that it is of sufficient size and sharpness.</p>
<p>But welfare campaigners say the rules are not enough.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s independent advisory body, the Farm Animal Welfare Council, says sheep may lose consciousness within five to seven seconds of the cut.</p>
<p>But research has shown that some calves remain brain-responsive for up to two minutes. This is because the carotid arteries can contract after the cut has been made, effectively sealing the severed ends and maintaining blood pressure in the brain.</p>
<p>The RSPCA says all meat produced from animals that have not been stunned before slaughter should be clearly labelled so that it can be easily identified by consumers.</p>
<p>Sharia law states that the abattoir involved in the process must be under the &#8216;close and constant supervision&rsquo; of an Islamic religious organisation.</p>
<p>Under these rules, the cut must be made to the right side of the neck by cutting the two carotids, the two jugulars, the windpipe and the gullet, but without breaking the spinal cord.</p>
<p>The carcass must empty of blood and a specific time should be allowed until the animal ceases to move before the next stage of the production process  &mdash;  de-skinning and removing the internal organs  &mdash;  may begin.<br>

		<p>The argument here from the English standpoint seems to be more an animals right issue than a human rights issue. </p>
<p>They are killing the animals in a manner to satisfy the Muslim. Killing in a manner considered to be inhumane. </p>
<p>Concern is more for the Muslim than for the sensibilities of the animals.</p>
<p> And this is done for food served at Ascot and Wembley and other sports venues? My intuition tells me that you probably see ALMOST NO MUSLIMS AT THOSE PLACES TO JUSTIFY THE PRACTICE! Extreme cases make for bad law and policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All the beef, chicken and lamb sold at Wembley Stadium is halal which means a large proportion of the meat on offer to our customers falls into this category.&rsquo; Pork, which is forbidden to Muslims, is also served at the stadium.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey you English, get rid of that pork. A server might accidentally touch a piece of pork and then touch a piece of beef and chicken and then serve the beef or chicken to a Muslim - - and we couldn&rsquo;t have that. The &#8220;brothers&#8221; might be upset.</p>

		<p>I have the blood of Englishmen coursing through my veins, and their glorious White skin wraps my being.</p>
<p>I feel no sympathy for them.  They betrayed White Humanity by continually electing treasonous White politicians who promised them easy benefits in exchange for ignoring the dark hordes who were invited and imported into England in a barter deal of Labour Party votes for immigrant benefits.</p>
<p>May White England suffer all it deserves and thereby serve as a warning to White America.  When every parish church and grand cathedral in England is a mosque, maybe our own people here will start to take notice of the threat.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Atlanta skyline from the west. How many churches steeples do you see? Zero.  How many mosques with gleaming dome and towering minaret do you see?  Currently one, and its built on a rise in the landscape so that Mohamet can claim triumph.   There will be more.<br>

&gt;</p>
<p>As I long suspected, it&rsquo;s a money deal.</p>
<p>This is the EU-EADS coalition in action.  Money passes between rich hands as a function of &#8216;trading offsets&rsquo; (billion dollar construction projects in SWA, managed by European architectural firms without competition) which allow Islamic intrusion into European culture at a level so basic that if it were interrupted &#8216;at some later point&rsquo; it would cause massive upheavals as local, more humane and more costly, Euro suppliers are long gone.</p>
<p>These offsets are thus dangerous both economically and culturally and should NEVER be entered into with a religious culture as subversive and ultimately hostile to the West as that which dominates the Middle East.</p>
<p>Given the problems in Turkey and elsewhere with Avian Flu and their definition of personal sanitation, I would also hesitate to say that &#8216;permissible&rsquo; actually means clean and safe.</p>
<p>That said, the Wiki article on Halal actually mentions that stunned animals are also not dead and that there are signs (via implanted brain monitors) of massive pain center responses to the bolt being driven into their skulls.  Killing is not a natively merciful thing but protein is what makes us strong.</p>
<p>If you want to start people thinking, you&rsquo;d better start with the notion that they are predators and that&rsquo;s that.<br>

		<p>Certainly the Jews have contributed far more to Britain than Muslims ever will. Nevertheless, a civil society should have the right to improve its treatment of animals, even in slaughter. Sanitary conditions should be as uniform as possible, in the interests of public health and assurances that animals are treated humanely.  </p>
<p>Freedom of religion is wearing its welcome out both in America and Europe.Certainly Africans, Asians and Russians have never had much use for religious equality. They probably were right. If a group runs a society, it should have the right to impose its beliefs. I&rsquo;m not a believing Christian, but if imposition of traditional Christian morallity is what it takes to suppress the barbarian mob from the destruction of America, so be it. Another lousy idea by Jefferson, the sybaritic fey philosophe who has saddled us with a &#8220;Bill of Rights&#8221; that his admirers on the Supreme Court have turned into a blank check for a Third World, valueless society.</p>
<p>Its time for a new Constitution in America (written) and in Britain (unwritten or written as the white majority may decide).</p>

		<p>How much money is going from the food companies to the religious supervisors to get the certification? I assume that many people are making a living from this. It&rsquo;s got to be a big boost for the religious groups as the money will spread throughout the religious group in many ways. How much is this costing the average Brit?</p>

		<p>To #2 Blaak Obongo, I always love your comments. Um, I recently noted that my vegetarian supplies are &#8220;Halal Certified&#8221;, I am not sure what to think, perhaps someone out there can let me know.</p>
<p>To #4 &#8220;..cutting the throat (of the animal) and letting the blood drip&hellip;&#8221; Practicing for the MAIN EVENT. Good chilling comment!</p>
<p>What has happened to the English nation&rsquo;s traditional revultion to ANY cruelty to animals. That nation used to be up in arms (screaming tabloid headlines etc) re any animal cruelty or even if a dog or horse had to be put down humanely for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I wish even the extreme animal rights groups all the best with this one.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really sad how there&rsquo;s no hope for the once Great Britain. Their leaders have allowed Muslims to come in and ruin their once beautiful country and they have sold out their own people and culture to please the vile Muslims who have nothing but contempt for them.</p>

<p>And, no one tells them &#8220;ritually slaughtered meat&#8221; is just a euphemism for satisfying a blood lust under the name of a third world religion.</p>
<p>Their religion is concerned with too much killing and cruelty, and they deserve to be tried and convicted for this practice and other injustices, like stoning women to death for being in the company of a man who is not a relative.</p>
<p>And before this ongoing saga reaches its climax they just might be called to account for their crimes.</p>

		<p>So just how much of this practice is going on unannounced in the U.S.? We can&rsquo;t be naive enough to think it isn&rsquo;t happening here already. And the U.S. will secretively (at first) cave just as Britain did, to be followed by the gradual public pronouncement of racism and intolerance of any disapproval.</p>
