			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Worden, Daily Mail (London), September 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A popular Spanish nightclub has been forced to change its name from Mecca after sparking a furious reaction around the Islamic world.</p>
<p>Intelligence chiefs warned owners they were being targeted by extremists who claim the disco is insulting to their religion.</p>
<p>Hackers broke into the nightclub&rsquo;s website and posted a video threatening &#8216;a great war between Spain and the people of Islam&rsquo; if the venue did not change its name.</p>
<p>The controversy then spread around the Muslim world with media in the Middle East and north Africa picking up on the story.</p>
<p>Today the owners, said to include former Real Madrid goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, agreed to change the club&rsquo;s name after meeting with local Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>La Meca (Spanish for Mecca), was the most popular disco in the coastal city of Aguila, in Murcia, southeastern Spain, in the 1980s and 90s before it closed down a decade ago.</p>
<p>It re-opened on June 18 with the same name, sparking the current controversy.</p>
<p>Last week Spain&rsquo;s intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Centre (CNI), alerted the owners to threats being made online.</p>
<p>Moderate Spanish Muslims also called for the name to be changed.</p>
<p>Mohamed Ali, head of the Spanish Federation of Islamic Religious Entities said: &#8216;Muslims pray towards Mecca and it is there that the prophet received the holy Koran.</p>
<p>&#8216;Calling a place for dancing and drinking by that name shows disregard to the feelings of Muslims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some Muslims have also objected to the design of the club, which is adorned with minarets in the style of a mosque.</p>
<p>The local Islamic Federation of the Region of Murcia consulted lawyers who planned to sue the club for insulting the honour of their religion.</p>
<p>This week Iranian station Radio Islam described the name as &#8216;insulting&rsquo; and Dubai-based Arabic news channel Al Arabiya, the second largest in the Arabic world, said it &#8216;insulted Spanish Muslims&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Facebook pages have been set up demanding the name is changed.</p>
<p>Abou Karim, writing on a Facebook site called &#8216;Everyone against the nightclub called Mecca in Spain&rsquo;, said: &#8216;They have declared war on Islam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The controversy even crossed the Atlantic to the U.S., where the website Infidels are Cool commented: &#8216;So it&rsquo;s fine to build a mosque within a block of Ground Zero, where Muslims killed nearly 3,000 innocent people, but using the name of a city is a problem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Today the owners of the nightclub called a press conference to be held with local Muslim leaders in which they will confirm their plans to change the venue&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>On its website the club is asking for suggestions for a new name.</p>
<p>The disco&rsquo;s logo, which includes Islamic symbols, and the minarets, will also be changed.</p>
<p>Spain has 1.5 million Muslims, making up just under three per cent of the population.</p>
<p>The country has long been a target for Al-Qaeda fanatics who demand the right to re-establish Muslim rule in southern Spain.</p>
<p>In March 2004 Islamist terrorists blew up four packed commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people and injuring 1,500 others.</p>
<p>The group which carried out the attack were said to be inspired by Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s calls to revive Al-Andalus, as Spain&rsquo;s Muslim kingdom was known in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, is the holiest meeting site in Islam.</p>
<p>Every year around 13 million Muslims make a pilgrimage to the city.<br>

		<p>Gene Pitney`s song &#8220;Mecca&#8221; comes to mind reading this story. So does living in  &#8220;A Town Without Pity&#8221; apparently. But, he always thought the world would be destroyed by Peyton Place style busybodies, not Muslim extremists!</p>

		<p>This is silly.  They don&rsquo;t mean Mecca, the religious site.  The word &#8220;mecca&#8221; also has come to have the meaning, in English, of being the focal point - a mecca for talent, a mecca for dancing, a mecca for anything.</p>
<p>Will there be a similar movement against any nightclubs with a Christian-themed name?  Is &#8220;Paradise&#8221; similarly to be outlawed as a name?</p>

<p> Perhaps the war should be waged- better now than later to stand up to the Moors.<br>
The Mohammedan world is itching for this war- it is going to come to pass. </p>

		<p>The West   &mdash;  -  European peoples and the polities and cultures they have created   &mdash;  - is still very potent in terms of technology, economy and military prowess. However, it&rsquo;s cultural confidence has ebbed so much   &mdash;   and its institutions so treason- ridden   &mdash;  - that it is increasingly despised by the rest of the world. Forget rising China and India; such &#8216;conventional&rsquo; civilizational challenges have always occurred and always will. What is unprecedented is how we, strong as we are, collectively cower and rush to appease tin-pot dictators, invite third world multitudes attracted to our countries while making incessant brazen threats and demands, and allow the open invasion of our heartlands   &mdash;   all abetted by our &#8216;elites&rsquo;. Anyone with even a cursory grasp of history understands this will not end well   &mdash;  - the question is, for whom! As for the Neo-medievalist Muslim hordes, they would be far better off in the long run if it is the West that rallies and pushes them back where they belong. If we commit ethnic &amp; civilizational suicide, it will likely be the Chinese that do it   &mdash;   and remember who it was that destroyed the first chalifate (and very nearly Europe as well!) less than a millenium ago.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that the comments, both for this article and the one about the Seattle cartoonist, are no longer available on the original site.  I suspect, as kitty (#4) pointed out, the comments were critical of Islam - and so the news site removed all of them out of fear for their own safety.  This further underscores how dangerous Islam is to our liberties.</p>

		<p>I have said we need a new Constitution, and that the Bill of Rights, with the exception of the substance of the 2nd,9th and 10th Amendments shouldn&rsquo;t be in that new Constitution.  So, when we eliminate the increasingly useless and overstretched First Amendment, we can use &#8220;islamic&#8221; terms for anything we want. Detergent, deodorant. Use your imagination.</p>
<p>For Islam would be recognized for what it is: an invading army,not a religion. And no Supreme Court for ethereal Harvard justices to rule otherwise.  </p>

		<p>I have to laygh at this. Here is Chicago we have a strip club&hellip;.er&hellip;gentleman&rsquo;s club called the Admiral. They were going to rename in Babylon (After that decadent city) in october 2001. Then 9/11 happened. They decided to stay with the original name because they thought Babylon would remind people of the middle east terrorist.<br>
   I guess noone ever told them that Admiral is an arabic word.</p>

		<p>Some suggested names for the nightclub:</p>
<p>Club Dhimmi.  Club Armenian Genocide.  The Greek Genocide Club.<br>
The Ottoman Sultan Club.  The Kosovo Club.  The Chechnya School Massacre Club.  </p>
<p>Just a few dual purpose names that would be unique and serve as reminders of historical events centering around the religion of Peace.</p>
