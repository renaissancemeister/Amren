<h1>Sikh Man Sues Convenience Store Chain</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Burlington Times News, September 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Durham-based convenience store chain faces a federal lawsuit over its handling of two job applications from a man who immigrated to this country from India and claims it subjected him to religious and racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The chain, M.M. Fowler Inc., operates Family Fare stores throughout the state.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Raleigh, alleges that one of the firm&rsquo;s account executives discriminated against Surjit Singh Saund, a 59-year-old resident of Wake County and adherent to the Sikh religion.</p>
<p>Sikhs can&rsquo;t shave or cut their hair, and must wear turbans. Saund has complied with those strictures throughout his life, his lawyers say.</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t caused him trouble at other convenience-store jobs he&rsquo;s held since his arrival in this country, including one at a Mobil station that he&rsquo;s held for the past six years, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>But Fowler&rsquo;s account executive allegedly told Saund the firm wouldn&rsquo;t hire him as a store operator unless he removed his turban, cut his hair and shaved, the suit claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s [EEOC&rsquo;s] website warns that employers do have to make what are termed &#8220;reasonable accommodations&#8221; for a worker&rsquo;s or applicant&rsquo;s religious practices.</p>
<p>It specifically mentions Sikhs as being among the faiths whose dress or grooming practices might require accommodation, save in cases of undue hardship.</p>
<p>A four-attorney legal team that includes a lawyer from an advocacy group called Public Justice, represents Saund. Based in Washington, D.C., Public Justice offers people help in civil-rights, environmental, labor and consumer-rights cases.</p>

		<p>This is ridiculous. Would the EEOC force an employer to retain a worker who insists on wearing a burka for religious reasons? Of course we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem in the first place if non-Europeans weren&rsquo;t immigrating here, as was the case from the start of the country all the way until 1968. And with 15 Million unemployed (officail estimate) this foreign trouble-maker is hogging a job that a real american could fill. </p>

		<p>The Sikh too must carry a dagger with him. Illegal. So they carry a small &#8220;symbolic&#8221; dagger.</p>
<p>Those daggers are used primarily if not almost exclusively on Muslims that they cross swords with.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve been insisting they have a religious right to wear turbans instead of motorcycle helmets, hardhats, and uniform headdress.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of sikhs we&rsquo;re I live.  It is so unnerving to see them sometimes because they&rsquo;re always wearing their pajama-suits and these big colorful turbans, along with santa clause beards and handlebar mustaches!  Their poor kids have to wear their hair wrapped up in a kind of do rag that looks like a diaper.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, most sikhs I&rsquo;ve met are nice and they smile a lot, it is just so jarring to see someone so utterly different!  </p>
<p>The differences make meaningful interaction impossible.  That&rsquo;s why people flock together with those who are similar to them.  The human brain cannot compute or get used to the endless and wide variety of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; the liberals seem to think of as an ideal paradise.</p>
<p>I read about a year ago that liberal white parents in san francisco and other areas of california are pulling their kids out of asian dominated schools because their kids cannot compete academically and the asians &#8216;don&rsquo;t have fun and school spirit.&rsquo;  Well, you should have realized different groups don&rsquo;t mix before you supported turning yourself into a minority in your own land!<br>

		<p>Even in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police do we have turban headed east indians.</p>
<p>Canada is a disaster as a result of mass immigration of these types of people that want to push their religion and rights.</p>
<p>All thanks to the charter of rights and freedoms entrenched in the constitution by prime minister pierre elliot trudeau back in the 60&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>His son is now a member of the liberal opposition and I suspect he wants to be a pm too!</p>

		<p>In Canada now, most retail gas stations and convenience stores are run by asians, east indians, muslims or other similar immigrants.</p>
<p>Incredible how fast a country can go from peace and tranquility of home to the start of third world decay.</p>
<p>Look at India as the host of the commonwealth games.  Excrement and dogs running loose in the unfinished athletes quarters.  A stairway and ceiling collapsing.  Individuals withdrawing because it is unsafe and unsanitary.   This is what is coming to Canada!</p>

		<p>I found Anonymous #3&rsquo;s comment of interest regarding Sikhs, turbans and reluctance to wear motorcyle helmets. Could the govt, under the stimulus program, give every Sikh a motorcyle and an exemption from speeding tickets. The problem might be solved. After all, we Americans are accomodating. Just pull over when you see a turban on a motorcycle.</p>

<p>So why doesn&rsquo;t he go back to one of those other convenience store chain and get a job? Why go someplace you are not wanted unless it&rsquo;s to stir up trouble and fire a lawsuit?</p>

		<p>When I was a kid, just 25 years ago, I was ROUTINELY, PLAINLY told that if I was going to be hired, I&rsquo;d HAVE TO GET MY HAIR CUT. In some cases, a manager would say, first off, that my hair could not touch my collar. Mind you, this was simply to be a BAGBOY at a grocery store, or to pump gas.<br>
Well, I bellyached a little, but I never had the HUBRIS to complain to the world, or try to get a lawsuit going. Why?<br>
I believed, as real Americans did, back then, that employers had rights, even rights to be unfair. And I had no constitutional right to work at any given gas station. I had a CHOICE, to take the heat, or get out of the kitchen, you know?<br>
 Being unfair was not a crime. Guess it is now, in this totalitarian world. IF you are a &#8220;minority.&#8221;<br>
BTW, &#8220;MINORITIES&#8221; make up about 90% of the world&rsquo;s population, and borders are meaningless, so who&rsquo;s the minority? Whites.<br>
Who&rsquo;s the most despised, hounded, smallest minority in the world?<br>
The white, non-gay, non socialist male. Probably about 2% of the world&rsquo;s population. Funny.</p>

<p><br>
In 1973 the law was changed in England, to making motorcycle helmets compulsory. Failing to do so would result inn prosecution and possible fine/prison. In Southall West London,  our very first Indian colony and place for some of the worst race riots in our country, a white/Labour M, Sidney Bidwell  persuaded Parliment to allow Sikhs  to be exempt  on account of it would compromise them and interfere with their traditional headwear.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at a number of fast-food joints over the years and every single one of them had a dress code.  No more than so many rings per hand, only button earrings were permissible, and there were rules about facial hair for males.</p>
<p>Yet no one complained.</p>

<p>Yes, but you wont find the government forcing a ban on the &#8216;burka&rsquo;. Only whites need to be constantly put in their place.<br>

<p>Tim:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably right.  Here&rsquo;s the situation in California (due to a budget shortfall and the fact that the budget is 85 days overdue):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Seven of the nine rest stops along freeways in San Bernardino and Riverside counties are closing today because Caltrans cannot pay a contractor needed to keep them open.</p>
<p>A contractor that tests the well water supplying the rest areas hasn&rsquo;t been paid since June and will not continue the $3,000-per-month testing until a budget is in place&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rest stops are closing along the 10, 40 and 15  &mdash;  three major freeways, especially for trucks, in So. California.  I frequently travel the 5 between Los Angeles and Sacramento and have noticed about 1/2 or more of the rest stops have already been closed  &mdash;  and they are far and few between as it is.</p>
<p>But, in California, better to keep illegal colonists&rsquo; benefits flowing than re-open rest stops along the freeway that serve White drivers.  </p>
<p>Expect more &#8216;urine&rsquo; bombs:</p>
<p>Urine or trucker bombs are plastic jugs full of urine tossed along the highway by truckers, and non-truckers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In just a few days, crews (along California&rsquo;s I-5) collected more than 350 gallons of urine along a 67-mile stretch of freeway.</p>
<p>Because crews can&rsquo;t be sure if the fluid really is urine, hazardous materials specialists must be brought in to test the liquid before it&rsquo;s disposed in a sewage system&hellip;. the disposal of pee bottles, costs California taxpayers upward of $50 million a year.</p>
<p>Containers filled with feces and other human waste like used dialysis supplies and syringes are becoming ever more common along the highway.</p>
<p>Peterson said the bottles of urine in particular pose a health hazards to road workers   &mdash;   especially those who run the mowers that trim foliage along the highway.</p>
<p>The bottles have a tendency to explode when they&rsquo;re run over   &mdash;   even more so when it&rsquo;s hot outside&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/2a7m9no</p>
<p>Are you grossed out yet?  </p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t funny (or was it?) when Rush spoke of it several years ago, and it&rsquo;s less amusing now.</p>
<p>But with more rest stops closed and surly East Indian clerks putting &#8216;Out of Order&rsquo; signs in gas station rest rooms, expect more &#8216;bombs&rsquo; to be thrown.</p>
