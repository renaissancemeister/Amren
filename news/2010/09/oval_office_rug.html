	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s new presidential rug seemed beyond reproach, with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. woven along its curved edge. </p>
<p>&#8220;The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.&#8221; According media reports, this quote keeping Obama company on his wheat-colored carpet is from King. </p>
<p>Except it&rsquo;s not a King quote. The words belong to a long-gone Bostonian champion of social progress. His roots in the republic ran so deep that his grandfather commanded the Minutemen at the Battle of Lexington. </p>
<p>For the record, Theodore Parker is your man, President Obama. Unless you&rsquo;re fascinated by antebellum American reformers, you may not know of the lyrically gifted Parker, an abolitionist, Unitarian minister and Transcendentalist thinker who foresaw the end of slavery, though he did not live to see emancipation. He died at age 49 in 1860, on the eve of the Civil War. </p>
<p>A century later, during the civil rights movement, King, an admirer of Parker, quoted the Bostonian&rsquo;s lofty prophecy during marches and speeches. Often he&rsquo;d ask in a refrain, &#8220;How long? Not long.&#8221; He would finish in a flourish: &#8220;Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.&#8221; </p>
<p>King made no secret of the author of this idea. As a Baptist preacher on the front lines of racial justice, he regarded Parker, a religious leader, as a kindred spirit. </p>
<p>Yet somehow a mistake was made and magnified in our culture to the point that a New England antebellum abolitionist&rsquo;s words have been enshrined in the Oval Office while attributed to a major 20th-century figure. That is a shame, because the slain civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was so eloquent in his own right. Obama, who is known for his rhetorical skills, is likely to feel the slight to King  &mdash;  and Parker. </p>

		<p>Oddly enough, this lengthy apologia for MLK&rsquo;s plagiarism fails to mention that Theodore Parker was a White man:</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Yet somehow a mistake was made and magnified in our culture&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Notice the passive voice, here: &#8220;a mistake was made,&#8221; rather than naming the specific individual who made the &#8220;mistake.&#8221;  For that someone was Saint MLK himself, and, given his documented record of plagiarism, there is no reason to believe it was anything but deliberate.</p>
<p>Nor was the &#8220;mistake&#8221; &#8220;magnified by our culture,&#8221; either.  Like so many others, it has been deliberately papered over by the cult of political correctness which sees nothing but divinity in the &#8220;slain civil rights leader.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, everyone agrees the quote is not originally attributable to King - - but it does agree with what King did believe and did think - - so it is OK then?</p>

		<p>Since the idea that Martin Luther King&rsquo;s one line most worthy of inscription in the Oval Office was a line written by a white man, not a line original to King, is undoubtedly a blatantly racist notion, when is Obama going to be denounced as a racist?  Or does he get a pass because of the color of his skin despite the content of his character?<br>
If a white President had chosen that line he would be denounced as a racist who was trying to undermine the legacy of King.<br>
However, I&rsquo;m tired of pointing out the hypocrisy of black racists.  They are merely people of color; they are not people of principle.  All they care about is power; they deserve nothing.</p>

<p>Well, Comrade Parker is lucky that Comrade King the demigod, simply didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; his words for his &ldquo;lofty&ldquo; goals and more. After all, a &ldquo;doctoral dissertation&rdquo; and several &ldquo;original speeches&rdquo; by Comrade King, went well beyond the lending library stage of things.</p>

		<p>A little politically astute hedging there at the end of the article. Obama eloquent? MLK a &#8220;major&#8221; figure? No mention of King&rsquo;s well-documented plagiarism.  How appropriate that the words on the rug are not even his own.</p>
<p>Notice anything else odd about this rug? All the other quoted figures are past presidents, except for MLK. He was obviously dragged in by the nape of his neck in order to make this rug &#8220;inclusive.&#8221; </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have a rug just featuring a bunch of dead white men, can we, in this Brave New World of ours, even if it means dragging in somebody who obviously doesn&rsquo;t even belong? </p>
<p>Kind of like our current president.</p>

		<p>For over fifty years history has been rewritten and revised to suit the feminized,anti western,anti white male agenda.Why would anybody be surprised about a quotation on an a rug belonging to Obama giving credit to MLK when someone else made the original quote? When the the people who are now in the oval office think Islam and African culture made huge contributions to the forming of the United States a quote on a rug is really small potatoes. </p>

<p>(2) a &#8220;slight to King&#8221;? How is getting free ride on someone else&rsquo;s aphoristic skills a slight? It is a slight to Parker, not to MLK. </p>
<p>(3) Obama ordered up quotes from Teddy Roosevelt   &mdash;   but NONE from Saul Alinsky, Chairman Mao, Marcus Garvey, Eldridge Cleaver, Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, Nat Turner, Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture, Malcolm X, The Prophet Mohammed, Julius Malema or Ludacris? Why not? EVERY ONE of these anti-American radicals has been FAR more influential on Obama&rsquo;s thinking than ANY old dead white guy! </p>

		<p>Theodore Parker embodies the worst of American liberalism: Abolition.</p>
<p>The White abolitionists were not demanding the Kunta be sent back home to Ghana. They just wanted Kunta to be free in the South to roam around unguarded.  But the lovers of mankind in Boston never demanded that Kunta be sent to them so sexual congress between Kunta and their beautiful, brilliant, cultured White daughters could commence and immediately put an end to racism.</p>
<p>Until all the descendants of the Abolitionists are mixed mulatto mongrels, there will be no race justice for White Humanity in the Southland.</p>

		<p>#17 - the fact that King plagiarized his doctoral thesis is so well-accepted that even liberals admit it. I don&rsquo;t know whether or not the man (or woman) who actually came up with the material was white - he probably was - but the more important thing is that we have a federal holiday, not to mention an entire cult of personality, built on King and it&rsquo;s built on a lie.</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 12:35 wants evidence for MLK&rsquo;s plagiarized dissertation, so here it is.</p>
<p>https://tiny.cc/fcgw2</p>
<p>From that link: &#8220;Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s papers were donated by his wife Coretta Scott King to Stanford University&rsquo;s King Papers Project. During the late 1980s, as the papers were being organized and catalogued, the staff of the project discovered that King&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation at Boston University, titled A Comparison of the Conception of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman, included large sections from a dissertation written by another student (Jack Boozer) three years earlier at Boston University.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a footnote that points to:<br>
Radin, Charles A. (1991-10-11). &#8220;Panel Confirms Plagiarism by King at BU&#8221;. The Boston Globe. p. 1.</p>

		<p>Re: All Seeing Eye. Commentator #12&rsquo;s uncovering of Theodore Parker&rsquo;s radicalism is highly pertinent to what goes on here. MLK is the descendent of the Emerson-Thoreau-Parker movement prior to the civil war. A mushy form of pantheism, selfishness, and condescension towards ordinary Americans. The Transcendentalist movement, and its publications, were the Nation and New York Times of their day.</p>
<p>The New Age-type quote on Obama&rsquo;s rug basically is on its face meaningless, yet its political significance is meaningful. Despite some words of basic wisdom in Emerson and Thoreau, all of which can be found in other religious or secular sources relating back to the Greeks, the thrust of the movement they created was to tear down the principles of virtue and social stratification that the classically trained Founders restated and included in the original concepts of the American Republic. </p>
<p>MLK and the current President simply are the finishing touches on what these at best naive and at worst destructive precursors created. </p>
<p>Slavery in my opinion was irrational and self-destructive to the South. Nevertheless the unrestrained violence Lincoln wreaked on the South was unjustified. His near genocide was inspired by John Brown, Theordore Parker, and the whole Boston Mafia of the 1840&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>We continue to suffer from their arrogance.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Cassiodorus:</p>
<p>Do you have any proof of this?</p>
<p>That he plagiarized, and plagiarized extensively is not in dispute and easily provable.</p>
<p>Theodore Pappas, former editor of the magazine, Chronicles: Magazine of American Culture,  writes in his book,  The Martin Luther King, Jr., Plagiarism Story (Rockford, Illinois: Rockford Institute, 1994), the following:</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s Nobel Prize Lecture, for example, is plagiarized extensively from <br>
works by Florida minister J. Wallace Hamilton; the section on Gandhi and <br>
nonviolence in his &#8216;Pilgrimage&rsquo; speech are stolen virtually verbatim from <br>
Harris Wofford&rsquo;s speech on the same topic; the frequently replayed climax to <br>
the &#8216;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech &mdash; the &#8216;from every mountianside, let freedom <br>
ring&rsquo; portion &mdash; is taken directly from a 1952 address to the Republican <br>
National Convention by a black preacher named Archibald Carey; the 1968 <br>
sermon in which King prophesied his martyrdom was based on works by J. <br>
Wallace Hamilton and Methodist minister Harold Bosley; even the &#8216;Letter <br>
From Birmingham City Jail&rsquo;, that &#8216;great American essay&rsquo; so often <br>
reproduced in textbooks on composition, is based on work by Harry Fosdick, <br>
H.H. Crane, and Harris Wofford&hellip;. (p. 94).</p>
<p>See Here:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/29hkuck" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/29hkuck</a></p>
<p>And Here:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2eejwtw" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2eejwtw</a> </p>
<p>AND the excellent site linked by Southern Hoosier.</p>
<p>As Gary North writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;He received his Ph.D. from Boston University, where he plagiarized his doctoral dissertation. He also plagiarized sections of Stride Toward Freedom. This was his practice throughout his academic career. He regarded other men&rsquo;s words just as he regarded other men&rsquo;s wives: as ripe for the taking&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Spread The Word and Tell Everyone You Know (but be careful as any mention of King&rsquo;s multiple plagiarisms is clearly Hate Speech, considered stone-cold  Hate Facts, soon subjected to persecution under Hate Speech laws, and could mean your demise).  Remember:  To the the lefty masters, truth truth means nothing.</p>
<p>Just ask Theodore Pappas.</p>
<p>For revealing King&rsquo;s plagiarisms, Mr. Pappas received numerous death threats, a physical assault, unending rejection and was left wondering if it were all worth it.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s a thoroughly documented fact. The man&rsquo;s name was Jack Boozer, who was a contemporary of King at Boston U, in the same department. King&rsquo;s plagiarism of his dissertation and many other things is covered in Theodore Pappas&rsquo; &#8220;Plagiarism and the Culture War.&#8221; Boston U belatedly acknowledged the plagiarism but refused to rescind King&rsquo;s bogus doctorate.

<p>We read in Michael Hoffman&rsquo;s &#8220;Holiday for a Cheater&#8221;:</p>
<p>The first public sermon that King ever gave, in 1947 at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, was plagiarized from a homily by Protestant clergyman Harry Emerson Fosdick entitled &#8220;Life is What You Make It,&#8221; according to the testimony of King&rsquo;s best friend of that time, Reverend Larry H. Williams.</p>
<p>The first book that King wrote, &#8220;Stride Toward Freedom, - -was plagiarized from numerous sources, all unattributed, according to documentation recently assembled by sympathetic King scholars Keith D. Miller, Ira G. Zepp, Jr., and David J. Garrow.</p>
<p>And no less an authoritative source than the four senior editors of &#8220;The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.- - (an official publication of the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc., whose staff includes King&rsquo;s widow Coretta), stated of King&rsquo;s writings at both Boston University and Crozer Theological Seminary: &#8220;Judged retroactively by the standards of academic scholarship, [his writings] are tragically flawed by numerous instances of plagiarism&hellip;. Appropriated passages are particularly evident in his writings in his major field of graduate study, systematic theology.&#8221;</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s essay, &#8220;The Place of Reason and Experience in Finding God,&#8221; written at Crozer, pirated passages from the work of theologian Edgar S. Brightman, author of &#8220;The Finding of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another of King&rsquo;s theses, &#8220;Contemporary Continental Theology,&#8221; written shortly after he entered Boston University, was largely stolen from a book by Walter Marshall Horton.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation, &#8220;A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Harry Nelson Wieman,&#8221; for which he was awarded a PhD in theology, contains more than fifty complete sentences plagiarized from the PhD dissertation of Dr. Jack Boozer, &#8220;The Place of Reason in Paul Tillich&rsquo;s Concept of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to &#8220;The Martin Luther King Papers&#8221;, in King&rsquo;s dissertation &#8220;only 49 per cent of sentences in the section on Tillich contain five or more words that were King&rsquo;s own&hellip;.&#8221;!</p>
<p>In &#8220;The Journal of American History&#8221;, June 1991, page 87, David J. Garrow, a leftist academic who is sympathetic to King, says that King&rsquo;s wife, Coretta Scott King, who also served as his secretary, was an accomplice in his repeated cheating. (&#8220;King&rsquo;s Plagiarism: Imitation, Insecurity and Transformation,&#8221; The Journal of American History, June 1991, p. 87)</p>
<p>Reading Garrow&rsquo;s article, one is led to the inescapable conclusion that King cheated because he had chosen for himself a political role in which a PhD would be useful, and, lacking the intellectual ability to obtain the title fairly, went after it by any means necessary. Why, then, one might ask, did the professors at Crozer Theological Seminary and Boston University grant him passing grades and a PhD? Garrow states on page 89: &#8220;King&rsquo;s academic compositions, especially at Boston University, were almost without exception little more than summary descriptions&hellip; and comparisons of other&rsquo;s writings. Nonetheless, the papers almost always received desirable letter grades, strongly suggesting that King&rsquo;s professors did not expect more&hellip;.&#8221; The editors of &#8220;The Martin Luther King Jr. Papers&#8221; state that &#8220;&hellip;the failure of King&rsquo;s teachers to notice his pattern of textual appropriation is somewhat remarkable&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But researcher Michael Hoffman tells us &#8220;&hellip;actually the malfeasance of the professors is not at all remarkable. King was politically correct, he was Black, and he had ambitions. The leftist [professors were] happy to award a doctorate to such a candidate no matter how much fraud was involved. Nor is it any wonder that it has taken forty years for the truth about King&rsquo;s record of nearly constant intellectual piracy to be made public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supposed scholars, who in reality shared King&rsquo;s vision of a racially mixed and Marxist America, purposely covered up his cheating for decades. The cover-up still continues. From the &#8220;New York Times&#8221; of October 11, 1991, page 15, we learn that on October 10th of that year, a committee of researchers at Boston University admitted that, &#8220;There is no question but that Dr. King plagiarized in the dissertation.&#8221; However, despite its finding, the committee said that &#8220;No thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King&rsquo;s doctoral degree,&#8221; an action the panel said &#8220;would serve no purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>No purpose, indeed! Justice demands that, in light of his willful fraud as a student, the &#8220;reverend&#8221; and the &#8220;doctor&#8221; should be removed from King&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>I understand that a white man wrote all of King&rsquo;s speeches too.</p>
<p><br>
The bottom line is that King was just a front for a bunch of communist manipulators around him.  He was their creation, their  protégé, their puppet.</p>
<p>Just like Obama, come to think of it.</p>

		<p>#17.  Scholars have stated that over 60% of Kings dissertation was plagarized.  That&rsquo;s all the proof I can offer.</p>
<p>But for Michael King, that&rsquo;s not bad.  He couldn&rsquo;t miss, America needed a lightning rod, like a politican affirmative action candidate.  Michael was it.</p>

____</p>
<p>Just where, pray tell, is the &#8220;slight&#8221; to King?<br>
What strange, distorted wording!<br>
I fail to see what slight has been cast upon MLK.</p>
<p><br>
Here we have MLK being given undue  credit for words he did not compose, words he appropriated from someone else,  yet we are told that he is being &#8220;slighted&#8221;.</p>
<p>The myth of this newest saint in the firmament has grown so great that even when he is given credit he does not deserve, we are only told that he has been slighted. Poor man! How much must a martyr endure? It is not easy being a saint.</p>
<p>Bizarre, indeed.</p>
<p>(PS. And while I&rsquo;m asking, why should Obama feel the &#8220;slight&#8221; either?  The only one who has been slighted is Parker.)</p>

		<p>     Rewriting history . The Tuskegee airman in &#8221; October Sky ?&#8221; He never existed . He was a composite of the black store keeper and another man . The fighter pilot did exist but he was white and a Korean War vet not WW2 . He was the college educated engineer, one of the white hats in the mine (supervisors). &#8220;Walking Tall,&#8221; same thing . They take a white hero and make him black . Now, I am aware of Buford Puser&rsquo;s controversial standing in his own region . But we even have that among American Presidents, don&rsquo;t we ? They&rsquo;re rewriting history . And of course liberals now conveniently charge that the conservatives are the revisionist . But I remember the 80s . I was an AM radio fan and the debate was going on then, with conservatives warning us what was about to happen . The earliest I&rsquo;ve been able to trace it back is mid seventies with an article by conservative columnist, Jeffrey Hart . Again, warning us what was about to take place . I have the black author of &#8220;Jubilee&#8221;, Dobson or Dodson, of course a liberal, on tape stating, &#8221; This is why we must revise history .&#8221; But that&rsquo;s all I can find . Amren should pen an article on the subject that would clearly show the revisionist are the liberals . There are other movies by the way that I believe this is being done and who knows where else,except of course the liberal revisionist, they know .</p>
