<h1>New Party Enters Governor&rsquo;s Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert J. McCarthy and Deidre Williams, Buffalo News, September 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Freedom Party qualified for the statewide ballot in August when it submitted 45,300 petition signatures for its formation, while only 15,000 were required. Doyle [Eva M. Doyle, a retired Buffalo Public Schools teacher], 64, said she has no political experience but accepted the invitation of Charles Barron, a New York City councilman from Brooklyn, to be his running mate.</p>
<p>She was most concerned that neither of the major parties has any minority on its statewide ticket. &#8220;[The Freedom Party] sent representatives to Buffalo to find an African-American woman,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And there are no women on the ticket [for statewide offices], either. I felt it was the right thing for me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others from Buffalo, such as Erie County Legislator Betty Jean Grant, a Democrat, have also signed on to the effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the interest of the urban areas  &mdash;  especially Buffalo, Rochester and New York City  &mdash;  we need a party that takes notice of and addresses our issues,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no focus on Andrew Cuomo or Carl Paladino, but it&rsquo;s part of an empowerment move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted Kirkland, who hosts a show on WUFO radio, said callers to his program are only beginning to show enthusiasm, especially as Paladino&rsquo;s surge in the polls affects Cuomo&rsquo;s plans. The more steam Paladino gains, the more Cuomo will reach out to blacks, he predicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea behind [the Freedom Party] was the time of being ignored is over. When Cuomo picked his group, he totally ignored blacks,&#8221; Kirkland said. &#8220;But Paladino has sort of changed things in that Cuomo thought it would be a cake walk to [Albany], and he didn&rsquo;t need the black vote. Now that Paladino is closing that gap and came out of nowhere, every black vote Cuomo gets, he needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Nevertheless, Cuomo appeared Monday in Harlem with some of New York City&rsquo;s top African-American Democrats to shore up his credentials with black voters, immediately after Freedom Party protesters met him at the subway station.</p>
<p>Among those he met with were Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.; former New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson; former State Comptroller H. Carl McCall; and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, D-Manhattan, former chairman of the state Democratic Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, many political observers believe a party catering to minorities can only siphon votes away from Cuomo and the Democratic base. Some say that if the Paladino candidacy gets even stronger, the Freedom line will only help the GOP.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interviews with several black voters around Buffalo on Monday revealed no great enthusiasm for either major party candidate, a fair amount of ignorance about the Freedom Party, and a degree of ambivalence about the race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are so hard for blacks right now that if I don&rsquo;t see a black face, I&rsquo;m not going to vote for [him or her],&#8221; he [an East Side resident] said.</p>
<p>Corey Lucas, 24, said he will most likely vote for Paladino. The Black Rock resident said &#8220;it just seems like [voting for Paladino] would benefit me more.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Claudette Monroe, a 62-year-old grandmother who lives on Richmond Avenue with her son and daughter-in-law, said she plans to vote for Paladino. She is a frequent patron of the Frank L. Merriweather Library on Jefferson Avenue and said she heard about the racist and pornographic e-mails Paladino sent to his cronies. She doesn&rsquo;t condone them but doesn&rsquo;t condemn Paladino, noting that politicians often make bad choices, from cheating on their wives  &mdash;  &#8220;like [former Gov. Eliot] Spitzer&#8221;  &mdash;  to cheating taxpayers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joy Westin said she plans to support Cuomo, even though she doubts either candidate really cares much about the African-American community. Cuomo, she said, just seems &#8220;less scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>La Raza or Make the Road NY will start its own latino party.</p>
<p>The Tea Party purports to be nutral but leans white in a wishy washy way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next, a special political party for gays and lesbians?</p>
<p>In any case, what has made the U.S. &#8220;United&#8221; in the past was a common tongue, a dominant founding race in the majority, a common culture and shared values based on optimism, all stiched together by European ideals that go back to the Enlightenment.  </p>
<p>If you replace such commonalities with separateness, with every group looking out for its own, then for what purpose would a &#8220;United&#8221; States be?  Simply to give welfare payments to &#8220;the oppressed&#8221; wherever they come from?  </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be united if all you are is divided.</p>

<p>We can only hope.  Not that the New York GOP is any good, but you can&rsquo;t get much worse than the New York Democratic Party.  This is a state where even the Republicans favor sanctuary cities, affirmative action, and &#8220;gun control&#8221; that gives free reign of criminals over defenseless citizens.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Freedom Party&#8221; is of course misnamed.  You can be sure they favor high taxes to fund patronage jobs for blacks.  Let&rsquo;s see if the SPLC &#8220;monitors&#8221; this pro-black, pro-Latino party the way they &#8220;monitor&#8221; the pro-white American Third Position party.  I&rsquo;ll bet they don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   the SPLC has a policy of no enemies on the left.</p>

		<p>Insofar as the NY Governor race goes   &mdash;   Paladino lets his mouth run ahead of his brain.  However, his negative qualities are something us accountants term a &#8220;sunk cost.&#8221;  In other words, Paladino&rsquo;s rotten personality is already well-known, and to the extent that it will ever drag down his poll numbers, it already has.  He has nowhere to go but up.  Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, as Rush said a few weeks ago, is not the kind of man who grows on you over time.</p>
<p>Add to this that Rick Lazio will not run on the Conservative Party, and this Charles Barron will run on a liberal third party, and Cuomo is going to have a rough October.  He might still win, but Paladino is going to make him earn it.</p>

		<p> For many years now I&rsquo;ve wondered why blacks haven&rsquo;t formed there own political party. Democrats always take the black vote for granted so they don&rsquo;t really have to deliver anything to the black community. So an all black party will definetly have an impact.</p>

Ted Kirkland (Buffalo&rsquo;s own &#8216;angry black man&rsquo;) did an hour long program this afternoon on this topic. (That&rsquo;s only because his guest never showed. That happens to Mr. Kirkland a lot).</p>
<p>Kirkland is an endless stream of contradictory views and opinions. He tells blacks that their black leaders in Buffalo (and the Democratic party) have failed them (and they have). He tells them to consider other voting options. At the same time, he keeps INSISTING that blacks MUST have leaders that look like him. The guy never seems to grasp his contradictions.</p>
<p>As a side note, Mr. Kirkland is convinced that guns are being brought into the black community for the purpose of blacks killing blacks. He never goes into any depth as to who is involved in this conspiracy to supply blacks with guns but he knows it&rsquo;s being done. He just keeps asking the question, &#8220;Who is bringing these guns into our community?&#8221; He knows outsiders are supplying blacks with guns because as he says (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here), &#8216;these black kids ain&rsquo;t smart enough to graduate from high school. Anyone seriously believe they&rsquo;re smart enough to go out and find guns?&rsquo;  </p>
<p>This brings up another of his contradictions. He admits black kids aren&rsquo;t smart enough to graduate high school and yet he DEMANDS that the city hire more black police and firemen.</p>

		<p>The Freedom Party, and others like it, will only siphon minority votes away from the two mainstream parties, making them less reliant on minority votes, and creating a possibility for a more diverse political views to enter the national stage (people like us, perhaps?).  An d of course, if this movement grows among minorities, it will become acceptable, eventually, for whites to think the same.</p>

		<p>#11 Madison Grant stated my thoughts exactly.  We should celebrate minority parties that will siphon votes away from the liberals.  Right now, Obama is castigating &#8220;progressives&#8221; for their whining, and some of them are even indulging in tearful on-air rants  &mdash;  but will they sit home or abandon the Dems?  They know, of course, that  &mdash;  like the Tea Party  &mdash;  they will have little power outside a major party.  <br>
Even without their own party, blacks hold too much sway over public discourse with their uproars over every perceived slight and general pouting about white racism.  What the establishment elites don&rsquo;t realize of course is that most Americans don&rsquo;t care whether a candidate is racist or sexist.  In fact, such assumptions may actually help someone like Paladino, who looks like a real person because of his commonality and faults.</p>

		<p>The dirty secret of liberalism is that white liberals of the generations prior to about 1985 really AREN&rsquo;T that liberal when it comes to economic theory and work ethic.  In tough economic times, these people can&rsquo;t be counted on to say the sort of charitable, egalitarian things that minority entitlement fiends want to here.</p>
<p>And Obama is like this,  I&rsquo;ve noticed.  When confronted in speech venues by blacks wanting to know when someone is going to save them from the unfairness of it all, Obama normally hem-haws around the point and slips in some subtle white-sounding &#8220;admonitions&#8221; to the victim that he needs to get up and do something for himself. In and amongst all his sympathetic nods and grunts for the big mountain of racism the victim claims to be climbing.</p>

Remember to vote Dixiecrat in November. As for a Black Political Party, the only ones that suffer from this are the Liberals and Democrats. They are probably scared as hell about this development. </p>
<p>After all, a Black Candidate running against an Andrew Cuomo would only take votes away from that Democratic Candidate, while traditional Americans would vote for the Conservative Republicans.<br>
