<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Hartford City Council is reconsidering its proposal to have local imams perform Islamic invocations at the beginning of council meetings in September.</p>
<p>Council President rJo Winch called a news conference Wednesday to address the uproar over the proposal she supported Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But since a story was posted on NBCConnecticut.com, Winch and other council members said they have received numerous complaints and even some hate emails over the decision to begin the meetings with Muslim prayers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the separation between church and state?,&#8221; wrote one anonymous reader. &#8220;Why not an act of solidarity with your New York City American brothers and sisters who were attacked on 9/11?,&#8221; wrote another.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the council does say a prayer before every meeting, Winch says she&rsquo;s reconsidering the idea of the Muslim prayers so close to the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. She instead said she would consider an interfaith prayer before next Monday&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be 20 different faiths there on that day because, I understand his position, we have to understand we live in a multicultural city and there are 125,000 residents here so we don&rsquo;t want to have anyone be offended,&#8221; Winch said.</p>
<p>That idea, however didn&rsquo;t sit well with Council Minority Leader Luis Cotto, the council member who originally made the proposal to ask the imams to perform the invocations. Cotto said he had no problem with the timing of the proposal. &#8220;I thought that doing this in September or at the next meeting, which happens to be September, makes sense, and I still do,&#8221; Cotto said.</p>
<p>Local Islamic leaders were also not happy about Winch&rsquo;s apparent backtracking{snip}. Imam Kashif Abdul-Karim {snip} said he plans to be at City Hall Monday to say the prayer.<br>

							<i>Bob Connors, WVIT-TV (West Hartford, Connecticut), September 8, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>In the wake of the battle over a mosque at Ground Zero, a move by the Hartford City Council is sure to have its critics.</p>
<p>The Council announced Tuesday that it has invited local imams to perform Islamic invocations at the beginning of the Council meetings in September.</p>
<p>An e-mail from the Common Council called it &#8220;an act of solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Council President rJo Winch called it an important move for the Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel it is very important that, as a Council, we project a culture of inclusiveness in the City of Hartford. Too often it is our differences that divide us. In my opinion, it is our combination of differences that makes us strong,&#8221; Winch said.</p>

At first it thought is was some dumb typo. But no, it kept repeating. Wha??  Was some smart-alec reporter being sarcastic?  No, not that either.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see:   rJo Winch. What race she be?</p>
<p>No, no, don&rsquo;t tell me! Let me guess.<br>
Aha, I was right. She be black. She a sistah.<br>
An he be a brothah too.</p>
<p>Well, at least she makes it simple and doesn&rsquo;t clutter it up with any apostrophes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of them both. This is what&rsquo;s running Hartford today, the once-great capital of Connecticut.<br>

<p>One hundred years ago, Hartford was the most prosperous and advanced city in America. Now, they&rsquo;re broke and having Moslem prayers in the City Council.</p>

		<p>The pandering to certain groups has gotten repulsive; do any of our politicians have any shred of pride left anymore? The same do-gooders who are so solicitous of these groups would probably be murdered or imprisoned were they residents of any of these muslim countries.   </p>

		<p>Disgusting! This is a Christian nation, founded on Christian principles, so why should there be Moslem prayers said before the opening of a city council meeting? I&rsquo;m glad that the citizens caused such an uproar that it is now being re-considered, but the mere fact that this was ever considered in the first place is chilling. Enough pandering to Moslems. They treat Christians like dirt in their own countries, so why should we humor them at all?</p>
<p>&#8220;Winch and other council members said they have received numerous complaints and even some hate emails over the decision to begin the meetings with Muslim prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear what some of these &#8220;hate emails&#8221; are.</p>
<p>If the Puritan forefathers of Connecticut could see what is happening in their once God-fearing city, I assure you they would not tolerate it.</p>
<p>All religions are not created equal.</p>

<p>Answer: In a nutshell, these are not &#8220;our&#8221; politicians! </p>
<p>They are pandering to their own group, which has taken over&hellip;.in Hartford, at least. This is a preview of America to come.</p>

<p>Well, Hartford got what it had coming. It took over a hundred years but the chickens have finally come home to roost. </p>
<p>Hartford was the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was the site of the famous Amistad trial.  They have finally gotten what they deserve. Welcome to New Africa!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Anonymous #3&#8221;  Upon what fantastic information do you base this revelation that America is a &#8220;Christian nation?&#8221; America is no more a Christian country than it is a WHITE one anymore! Whether we like it or not, that is the sad reality of it. Pretending it is otherwise is pointless. </p>

		<p>Whatever happened to separation of church and state?<br>
What is equally disturbing is that the imam says he will attend and give the prayer anyway.</p>

		<p>Skip @ #6: There are countless videos on You Tube, which show Muslims burning Orthodox Churches and Monastaries, and knocking Crosses off the steeples of the Serbian Churches, while crowds of Kosovo Muslims cheer. The Religion of Peace at work again.</p>

		<p>#5 is on the mark!  Whites in the Old South said that blacks were unable to govern themselves in a civilized society and would even turn back to primitive religions.<br>
I wonder if wonder-boy Luis was thinking of &#8220;people&rsquo;s worker party&#8221; when he came up with Working People&rsquo;s Party?  How many working blacks (or whites or Hispanics) in Hartford do you suppose would belong to such an outfit?  It&rsquo;s probably full of deadbeats whose only &#8220;work&#8221; is gaming the system or dealing drugs.</p>

The Amistad trial was held in New Haven, Ct, not Hartford.<br>
The ironic thing is, BOTH cities have large black populations today. Whites fled long ago to the suburbs. The downtowns of both cities are not what they used to be and are dangerous for whites. How ironic. Don&rsquo;t go there.  I know, I am a native of Connecticut. My family had to flee New Haven in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>No separation of church and state exists. Constitution says gov&rsquo;t cannot establish a religion, nor can it keep people from practicing religion. That said, islam is a totalitarian ideology with no place in this country.</p>

<p>The Amistad Center for Art and Culture, Hartford<br>
  &#8220;This extraordinary collection of 7,000 works of art, artifacts and archives, documents more than three hundred years of the Black experience in America - a truly rich resource of immense educational value and testimony to America&rsquo;s diverse and dynamic culture. <br>
  An organization was formed to carry out this important mission, The Amistad Foundation. The collection was placed at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, the nation&rsquo;s oldest and continuously open public art museum and the first major museum in the region to house a gallery devoted to the subject matter of African American culture. Under the Foundation&rsquo;s ownership and auspice, the first collection-based exhibition in 1990 was held titled &#8220;Stand in the Place: Images from The Amistad Foundation&rsquo;s African American Collection.There are shackles and chains, a slave tag, and a pair of handmade chairs thought to be made and owned by slaves; historical photographs; slave contracts; books and manuscripts, maps and ephemera including broadsides; Harper&rsquo;s Weekly and Frank Leslie&rsquo;s newspapers; Currier and Ives lithographs; political cartoons; and paintings and sculpture. <br>
  The collection speaks to the origins and advancement of slavery, Black resistance and the abolitionist movement; the Civil War and Emancipation; Reconstruction; major artistic, literary and political figures; daily life; the church; military participation; minstrelsy and satire; the civil rights movement; and modern-day celebrities.&#8221; <br>
