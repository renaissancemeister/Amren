<h1>Loretta Sanchez on Univisión: &#8220;Vietnamese&#8221; Trying to Take Her Congressional Seat Away from Democrats</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gustavo Arellano, OC Weekly, September 20 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the same answer, Sanchez tells Ramos [Univision&rsquo;s Al Punto</cite> host Jorge Ramo] in pocha Spanish that Democrats might not come out to vote, thereby sealing a comeback for the GOP. It&rsquo;s especially worrisome for her, she says, because &#8220;the Vietnamese and the Republicans are  &mdash;  with an intensity (emphasis hers)  &mdash;  trying to take away this seat, this seat that we [Democrats] have done so much for our community, take away this seat from us and give it to this Van Tran, who&rsquo;s very anti-immigrant and very anti-Latino.&#8221;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t dispute Loretta&rsquo;s characterization of Tran, but seriously, Loretta: &#8220;Vietnamese&#8221; are trying to take your seat? Whither Phu Nguyen? Whither Bao Nguyen? {snip} ¡Tan pendeja que eres!</p>

		<p>Loretta Sanchez is right, the Vietnamese are trying to take over the seat.  This is the congressional seat where the Vietnamese rallied around the two Vietnamese candidates surprising the expected winner, a white man, by defeating him.  East Asians are increasingly looking for political capital.  East Asians have a ferocious ethnic-based greed.  Forget about the imaginary white-yellow alliance, East Asians have as much hatred and jealousy against white people as any other non-white group.  They want to take over.  Industries created by white people like the camera, musical instruments, gaming, steel and televisions have been taken over by East Asian companies and industries like the car, home appliance and banking are increasing becoming East Asian.  At the rate it&rsquo;s going the only things white people will be making are candles and wind chimes.</p>

I am absolutely shocked and offended by Loretta Sanchez&rsquo;s commercial.  Her Spanish is shockingly bad.  Honestly I think she would have done better to have Jared Taylor say the same word.  Honestly it&rsquo;s as if she never spoke a word of Spanish in her life and decided to that she needed to do something serious RIGHT NOW.  There&rsquo;s a wonderful expression in Brooklynese that sums up my feelings about Loretta&rsquo;s Sanchez successful attempt at comedy or failure to be serious :</p>

		<p>You know what I&rsquo;m sick of?  Where I work there&rsquo;s so many latinos - and whites who want to be latinos - and I have to pretend to support their causes for illegal immigrants because if I don&rsquo;t then I&rsquo;ll be canned without hesitation!</p>

		<p>Considering that Sanchez won the seat from Republican Bob Dornan thanks to an influx of Latinos- many of them illegals who voted illegally- she&rsquo;s got a lot of nerve whining about Vietnamese immigrants &#8220;trying to take away this seat&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Interesting that when she said &#8220;&hellip;trying to take away this seat, this seat that we [Democrats] have done so much for our community&hellip;&#8221;, they assumed that by &#8220;we,&#8221; she meant we as Democarts, not we as Hispanics.  I think the little Latina meant we as in Hispanics, judging by the context, and the fatc that Hispanics poltiicans are VERY racist a lot of the time, like openly so.</p>

<p>Just think if they team up? With Asian organization and Hispanic labor even candles and wind chimes might not be safe. But we&rsquo;ll always have white celebrities and movie stars and black athletes so the rest of us can assume things are Ok. </p>

		<p>Two points:</p>
<p> 1) Anonymous is correct. I marvel at how many whites on this site regard Asians as some sort of &#8220;ally.&#8221; </p>
<p>2) Sanchez won&rsquo;t face any heat for making this comment since Hispanics don&rsquo;t have to worry about political correctness. I don&rsquo;t happen to think she deserves any since she should be free to say whatever she wants (and is right by the way) but so should whites be free to say whatever they think without being ostracized.</p>

		<p>Gayle: Good point, having grown up in Orange County I second your opinion. Orange County has become a shell of what it used to be&hellip;&hellip;which was a safe middle class area with strong schools. Garden Grove (Sanchez&rsquo;) District is now full of Mexican Ranchero music, foreign flags, day labor, and massage parlors.</p>

AmRen&rsquo;s subtitle for this story: </p>
<p><b>Congresswoman says Vietnamese candidate is &ldquo;anti-Latino.&rdquo;</b> </p>
<p>She probably is. The Vietnamese invariably are anti-Latino. As are every other kind of Asians. </p>
<p>Asians regard Latinos the same way racially-conscious whites do: as lacking in work ethic, totally without ambition, and not real bright. So this brown-vs.-yellow battle in Orange County shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anybody   &mdash;   esp. as the OC now has such large quantities of BOTH of those colors. </p>
<p>The OC: Not quite on TV.</p>

		<p>I am Asian but was born in this country in the 50&rsquo;s. My parents are from Korea and came as medical doctors, both. At that time, immigrants assimilated which my parents did very well. In fact, Koreans today are astonished to learn that I do not understand Korean, I do not speak Korean, I do not know how to cook Korean food, I know no Korean history. I was taught just like any other Southern American citizen.</p>
<p>It angers me to see the many immigrants coming into this country who do not understand that it is their very great privilege to be here. They do not learn the language, the history, even who the President of the US is. They continue to read their own country&rsquo;s newspapers and treat Americans like dirt. </p>
<p>Maybe the one fault of White Americans is that, like the Native Americans, they trusted too much and opened their country up.</p>
<p>I, for one, am increasingly upset at what is happening in this country and I would even be willing to leave it, if it would guarantee that White Americans could keep their country. This Asian is not your enemy but a great admirer and supporter.<br>

		<p>Is this all about the inevitable fast developing ugly face of multiculturalism. Instead of the candidate standing to represent ALL Americans it has degenerated to us vs them vs them. As Gayle #2 said, unimaginable 40 years ago.</p>
<p>As for the alliance of whites and east Asians, very good when you are doing business and everything is going well, they are all very polite and friendly, when something goes wrong they are bad news and possibly still regard us contemptuously as foreign devils.</p>
<p>Whiteman, beware and stay alert. Multiculturalism just does not work, or as the old saying goes, &#8220;Birds of a feather stick together&#8221; as simple as that.</p>

		<p>Maybe White folks should wake up once and for all. There is no such thing as a multi-racial country that will survive or even be desirable as a place to live for any race.  Diversity or unity (which includes nonwhites) is a lost cause. Pat B. has something to say.</p>

		<p>&#8220;LAT TI nos&#8221; are some of the biggest racists on the planet. My mother works at an elementary school full of ESL students who can only speak Spanish. Guess who the school hired to teach them? A Chinese women fluent in Spanish. Guess what the parents of these Latino children think of her? Vicious hatred. Just like when a white person they are smugly speaking Spanish in front of in this country happens to know Spanish themselves. If any of you know Spanish, try speaking to them. They hate it. You knowing Spanish undermines some perceived power they think they have over you (even if they don&rsquo;t know a lick of English, themselves).</p>
<p>The Latino community should rightly feel humiliated, though. The Asians (who have a harder language barrier to overcome) do expose them for the low IQ peoples that they are. It throws a wrench in the &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; system too when another pet minority is thriving so well while another can&rsquo;t get beyond the GED phase.</p>

		<p>Remember that Loretta Sanchez first ran using her married name, she is/was married to a white man and she lost that race. She then decided to use her maiden name to show Latino voters that she was one of them and she has won election ever since. Good luck to the Vietnamese candidates. I hope that you win election.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the Vietnamese and the Republicans are &mdash; with an intensity trying to take away this seat&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that you didn&rsquo;t do the same exact thing to Bob Dornan, right loretta, including committing voter fraud to win the election?</p>
<p>Ira Melman reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were reportedly lavished on a non-profit, tax-exempt, California outfit known as Hermandad Mexicana Nacional   &mdash;   Mexican National Brotherhood   &mdash;   which it turned around and used to register noncitizens and illegal aliens in Orange County. Observers say Hermandad would probably have continued to escape legal scrutiny had it not wound up in the middle of the disputed 46th Congressional District race between Rep. Bob Dornan (R) and Loretta Sanchez (D)   &mdash;   who supposedly defeated Dornan by a margin of just 979 votes&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When your last challenger, Tan Nguyen, sent out a letter in Spanish warning illegal aliens not to vote (stated the letter)</p>
<p>&#8216;You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time, and you will be deported for voting without having a right to do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All hell broke loose.</p>
<p>Seems Mr. Nguyen was onto you viz. the illegal alien/non-citizen voter fraud you perpetuated in your last race and wanted to prevent you from doing to him what you did to Bob Dornan.  </p>
<p>But you were lucky because the letter backfired:</p>
<p>Joe Guzzardi  writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;California law enforcement officials raided Nguyen&rsquo;s home and campaign office as well as the home of a Nguyen staffer. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his opponent Phil Angelides called Nguyen&rsquo;s letter a &#8216;hate crime.&rsquo;The Orange County California Republican Party GOP chairman Scott Baugh insisted Nguyen quit.</p>
<p>Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy and Edward Kennedy wrote to the U.S. attorney general demanding a federal investigation.</p>
<p>Even Nguyen&rsquo;s fellow Vietnamese jumped ship&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter had the opposite effect intended and the la times (non caps on purpose) reported:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nguyen&rsquo;s Letter Draws Voters to Polls&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems the msm along with a few Republicans took ms. sanchez&rsquo;s side and not yours.</p>
<p>Is anyone surprised?</p>

		<p>Anonymous 11 - While my views seem to ruffle the occasional feather here on AmRen, I&rsquo;ll take all the East Asians who want to come to this nation.  They overwhelmingly share the American values of independence, hard work, and family unity. They&rsquo;re high-IQ contributors to this nation in all manner of ways, and they become loyal citizens, just as did the Irish, Italians, Germans, and all others who comprise the ethnic and racial stew that is America.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t feel that you should bow to certain ethnic and racial pressures and leave.  I for one would be sorry to see you go.</p>

		<p>Poster #17 is right.  Latinos oftentimes make fun of Asians and disrespect their authority.  I work with a tiny chinese woman who has to get a bunch of latinos to behave and do their work.  They constantly make fun of her race, language and, oh yes, her eye shape.  She tries to fight back by reporting them to her boss, but her (our) boss is a latino! (It&rsquo;s a Public institution where A/A is rampant, that&rsquo;s why.) So little is really done to address the situation.</p>
<p>This is ironic since it&rsquo;s the asians where I&rsquo;m at who are hiring illegals by the thousands.  Every asian restaurant, store or similar business is brimming with latino workers doing all the menial labor.</p>
