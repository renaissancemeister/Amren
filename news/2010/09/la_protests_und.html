<h1>LA Protests Underscore Frustration of Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Hoag, San Francisco Chronicle, September 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long ago a well-heeled area of Los Angeles, in more recent decades the Westlake district surrounding MacArthur Park has become a densely packed enclave of Central American immigrants fleeing brutal civil wars and grinding poverty in their home countries.</p>
<p>This week, the bustling community turned into a hotbed of unrest after a police officer shot and killed a Guatemalan day laborer who allegedly lunged at him with a knife. The incident Sunday sparked three days of protests by people who felt that killing Manuel Jaminez, a 37-year-old illegal immigrant, was an unfair and unnecessary use of police force.</p>
<p>The demonstrations surprised officials, who blamed the blowback on outsiders who had come to the area to stir up trouble. A visit to the neighborhood of grimy tenements with curlicued cornices and portals that belie a more elegant past reveals a social tapestry fraying from increasingly hardscrabble living and widespread frustration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The neighborhood has long been a first stop for new arrivals who have made the risky journey to &#8220;el Norte.&#8221; More than two-thirds of residents are foreign-born, almost three-quarters are Hispanic, almost half live in poverty.</p>
<p>Drawn to a neighborhood with flavors of home, about 118,000 residents jam the area&rsquo;s 2.7 square miles, making it one of the most crowded districts in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Here, they find everything from comfort foods such as tamales and Pollo Campero  &mdash;  Central America&rsquo;s beloved fast-food fried chicken chain  &mdash;  to fake Social Security cards and driver&rsquo;s licenses to cheap lodging in shared bedrooms and living rooms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jobs are few and far between, rents are high, and unfamiliar laws are stringently enforced. Crime is also high, with much of it related to the neighborhood&rsquo;s homegrown Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, a gang formed by Salvadoran immigrants in the 1980s that has morphed into one of the most vicious in the nation.</p>
<p>Particularly vulnerable are campesinos, subsistence farmers from the indigenous communities of rural Mexico and Guatemala who often are far less prepared to cope than other immigrants.</p>
<p>Many have only a few years of formal schooling and may barely be able to read and write. Some speak little Spanish, having grown up in isolated areas where native indigenous languages are mainly spoken.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Apartments are often crowded with several families sharing rent. To eke out a living, many have taken to peddling everything from bootleg DVDs to bacon-wrapped sausages, turning the sidewalks into a chaotic flea market on evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Latin American countries, street peddling is a ubiquitous and time-honored way of getting by when jobs are few and government assistance is scarce. Immigrants have a hard time understanding why it is illegal here and they resent crackdowns by police who give out $250 tickets and sometimes confiscate their goods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stress of trying to make ends meet plus social and emotional isolation leads some to seek refuge in alcohol. Jaminez had been drinking when he allegedly menaced two women and then police officers with a knife.</p>
<p>Residents said public drinking is out of control.</p>
<p>The neighborhood has seen progress. Police have driven gangs out of MacArthur Park and have worked to build trust with the illegal immigrants so they&rsquo;ll report crime, said Councilman Ed Reyes, who represents the area. Street peddlers said that although gangs still extort &#8220;taxes,&#8221; the problem is less serious than it used to be because of stepped-up police presence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the hardship, most immigrants don&rsquo;t want to go home. Tomas Gomez, Jaminez&rsquo;s brother-in-law, said that although day laborer jobs had dried up considerably and Jaminez pined for his wife and three young sons, he did not want to go back to Guatemala.</p>

		<p>Heather MacDonald made a good point yesterday in National Review.  (Probably the first time that NR has made a good point in a very long time).  Los Angeles has Special Order 40, the sanctuary city directive.  The ruling class keeps telling us that we have to have these SO 40s and sanctuary city policies so that the &#8220;good&#8221; illegal aliens won&rsquo;t fear giving information to the cops about the &#8220;bad&#8221; illegal aliens.  </p>
<p>If SO 40 created such good community-police relations, then why all this anti-white anti-police rioting on the part of these Central American interlopers?</p>
<p><i>Jobs are few and far between, rents are high,&hellip;(snip)&hellip;Apartments are often crowded with several families sharing rent.</i></p>
<p>Duh, Sherlock.  That&rsquo;s why rents are so high, because there are so many people cram jamming into one domicile.  This means you have multiple income earners, either from under-the-table jobs or welfare checks, and they&rsquo;re able to pool their money to bid up rents, and price out single income earning individuals and families, and even two-earner families.</p>
<p>I want the illegals deported, by yesterday.  But as a stop-gap, I would implement a rule that only one person&rsquo;s income could be used in a rental lease agreement or mortgage.  This should get, as Steve Sailer would call it, &#8220;sand state&#8221; real estate deflated down far enough as to become affordable once again for native born white Americans of the working middle class.</p>

		<p>Remarkable that what I think is meant to a simple article boils down to a picture of a neighborhood that is illiterate, extremely poor, no sense of civic space, where buildings are wearing out overcrowding, and where document forgery is an open business.</p>
<p>And yet they demonstrate and demand &#8220;respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remind me again about how these people are &#8220;enriching America?&#8221;</p>
<p>It truly never ceases to amaze me that our country, stuck with a black underclass that we inherited (and let&rsquo;s face it) are never going to get rid of, blithely imports new underclasses from multiple countries.</p>

		<p>MacArthur Park has long been an unusual enclave for illegal aliens from Mexico.<br>
In 1989 I took a bus from Westwood to the East Hollywood section<br>
of Los Angeles.<br>
A Westwood bus ran late and a subsequent L.A. bus was delayed.<br>
While on route, a black bus driver had intentionally skipped my<br>
stop then told me that he was on the final shift and was driving<br>
back to his bus station over an hour away.<br>
He indicated that he would drop me off down the road.<br>
40 minutes later at about midnight he stopped the bus dropping me off in a remote section of MacArthur Park.<br>
There were only 3 street lights operating within the first<br>
half mile.<br>
As I anticipated an hour long walk from my current location I proceeded forward.<br>
As I passed the first street light several Mexicans roamed the street aimlessly high on drugs.<br>
As I walked down the street these drug addicts became more numerous as they moved in and out of the shadows.<br>
In trying to keep my head forward I put on my headphones and began listening to music.<br>
One drug addict yeld something in english equivelent to imposter<br>
but was too far behind me too catch up running while high on drugs.<br>
An hour later I was well out of MacArthur Park, called a cab from<br>
an all night restaurant, got to my destination, and returned to<br>
Westwood.<br>
The following year there were over 30 murders in the MacArthur Park area and in the past 10 years blacks have been displaced<br>
and forced out of Califoria.</p>

		<p>All these folks did is bring the &#8220;old country&#8221; north with them and make the same mess they had in the &#8220;old country&#8221;, but now in &#8220;el norte&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe slightly better, at least for a while, but the old habits and ways die hard, don&rsquo;t they? Soon the entire place will be like it was in the &#8220;old country&#8221; - - or maybe it is more or less like that now?</p>

<p>What a tragedy that this once jewel of L.A., MacArthur Park, has turned into what&rsquo;s discribed as a &#8220;neighborhood plucked right out of Guatemala City.&#8221; What I don&rsquo;t understand is how the Hollywood &#8216;elite&rsquo; can drive by such sights and think that&rsquo;s good for our country. Give it time, the brown tide will soon be banging on the gates of Beverly Hills, but by then the liberals will have moved on to another area of the country preaching the virtues of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to their White neighbors at the country club. Their favorite excuse for moving out of California is &#8220;oh it was just getting so expensive to live there!</p>
<p>-fleeing brutal civil wars and grinding poverty in their home countries.</p>
<p>So they bring &#8220;brutal civil wars and grinding poverty&#8221; to MacArthur Park! THEY&rsquo;RE the ones that made their native countries the cess pools they are, now they&rsquo;re HERE!</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is very hard here,&#8221; said Ricardo Fernandez, a retired Nicaraguan truck driver. &#8220;I tell people not to come, it&rsquo;s not as good as before. But people still come.&#8221;</p>
<p>And people like you DON&rsquo;T LEAVE!! Notice he tells THEM not to come, but HE stays.</p>
<p>-Now, they&rsquo;re coming because they don&rsquo;t have food.&#8221;</p>
<p>WHAT!! And here I thought they wanted the &#8216;Amelican dleam&rsquo;! At the rate they&rsquo;re coming, WE won&rsquo;t have any food! </p>

		<p>Yes it is our fault ill tempered, illiterate, alcoholic indians and peasents who can&rsquo;t even speak spanish, let alone English,  snuck into our country, seized control of our second largest city, promptly ruined it, and now can&rsquo;t get jobs as surgeons, lawyers, businessmen and other jobs which they are entitled <br>
to. How can you blame them for rioting and trying to stab cops?  </p>

<p>As Richard Harris demonstrated some 40 years ago, nothing good ever comes out of MacArthur Park. </p>
<p>Of course, back then, the whole MacArthur Park area of the city was White. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Despite the hardship, most immigrants don&rsquo;t want to go home&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should they go home?  Our government caters to them in every manner at our expense  &mdash;  free health care, food and housing and groveling Whites, including at the highest levels of government, to meet their every demand.</p>
<p>Today, the most expensive high school ever built opened in Los Angeles for the many children of illegal colonists.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t they have the best while you child&rsquo;s school lacks the most basic of supplies such as toilet paper?</p>

<p>I predict that by the end of the year, if not sooner, every seat in that theater will be ripped apart, the carpet torn up, the walls scratched up and scarred and damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>All for a good cause, right?  Now Pay Up Kulak!  Hand over your property and wealth to those more worthy of your hard earned money.</p>

		<p>The key point of this article is when it states that the workers having trouble finding jobs and with other difficulties &#8220;don&rsquo;t want to go home.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible that there should even be the option of wanting to go home or not since they are in the country illegally. Back in the 1950&rsquo;s, under the &#8220;Operation W  &mdash;    &mdash;  -k&#8221; program of Eisenhower, illegals were shipped back to Mexico, whether they liked it or not, and most decided to not try and return due to much stricter enforcement of immigration laws. Now we have all of Los Angeles being a sanctuary city, with probably many of those without papers being able to even vote in elections.</p>
<p>How the times have changed!</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t want to go home. Of course not. Stress makes them drink outdoors in quantities that make suburban white drunks ashamed. They eat sausages wrapped in bacon. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Federal govt will devise a &#8220;program&#8221;, run by the outsiders who incited the violence against the police, to solve these social problems.</p>
<p> Since there is no chance that these invaders would receive what other sane nations, like China, would render, i.e., massive force and evacuation to the Mexician Border or to the awaiting ships back to Central America, might as well give them the few pennies left in the California Treasury.</p>

		<p>Yes, the situation is similar here, in Colorado.  Last weekend I took a motorcycle ride over to Lakewood, the city I grew up in.  I moved out of there 15 years ago because it was &#8216;going to the dogs&rsquo;, in a manner of speaking.  Boy, am I glad I left!  You should see it now!   A miniature Mexico!  The billboards for &#8216;Buh-whiser&rsquo; are all written in mexican.  Panaderias, and other &#8220;mexican named business&#8221; abound,  except for the 50% of malls and restaurants that are boarded up. </p>
<p>Every single bus stop had hoards of browns milling around, waiting.  I went into a Pawn shop, Mexican employees speaking to mexicans in spanish.  My god,  how awful!  I could cry.</p>

&#8220;Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.<br>

		<p>It seems these illegals don&rsquo;t exactly report ALL crime to the buddy-buddy cops. They fail to mention their own arrival here. It&rsquo;s astounding how many enclaves there are in the U.S. that Americans can&rsquo;t even go. Every state and most cities have a third world barrio that one wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize as being in the U.S.</p>

		<p>All along Wilshire as you move through this area you can see the old remnants of what was a beautiful early and mid-twentieth century part of old Los Angeles. Old hotels, ballrooms, modernist office buildings laid out among several gently rolling urban parks.</p>
<p>Now these buildings stand several steps removed from their original intent. Office buildings converted to extremely expensive lofts with elaborate security systems that remind one of Colombia or Sao Paolo. The ballrooms are closed up except for private parties or filming. The grand old hotels are now crammed full of immigrant families. </p>
<p>Worst of all, the gently rolling parks are teeming with thousands of illegals, milling about. At the end of each day, the parks are literally covered with garbage, despite their being plenty of garbage cans. It&rsquo;s a bustling neighborhood, to be sure, full of life. But it&rsquo;s the life of a third world population inhabiting the gutted remains of a first world city. Sad only begins to describe it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;MacArthur Park,&#8221; written by Jimmy Webb and made into a huge hit single in 1968 by Richard Harris, will never be the same.  I very much doubt its current inhabitants have heard the record or even care about it.  One might as well rename it; there&rsquo;s no point sullying the MacArthur family name, which, of course, includes one of our nation&rsquo;s greatest generals. </p>

		<p>If you have never been to McArthur Park, then you&rsquo;re in for a real treat.  You would have no idea that this neighborhood was in the US were it not for the occasional 99 cent store.  It looks to be straight out of a third world dump.  Anyone who claims that these people come here to make a better life for themselves needs to take only one look at that neighborhood.  These people came here to replicate their old life, but with free school, health care and food.  These people LIKE a junky, dirty, tacky life.  They don&rsquo;t want nice things.  For example, a couple years ago a BABY was shot in killed their in broad daylight by a gang member. As far as I could tell, there was no mass exodus out to the country, or back to Guatemala.  Everyone just went on as usual.   </p>
<p>The saddest part is that the neighborhood is right by a lovely park with a pond (a park you cannot visit to experience ANY serenity, BTW).  It&rsquo;s close to downtown and Hollywood.  It could be a GREAT neighborhood.  It even has some pretty cool old buildings, churches and synagogues. It truly could be the rare neighborhood in LA where people could walk from place to place. My hope is that this neighborhood slowly gets gentrified like Echo Park.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a beautiful photo of MacArthur Park.  Don&rsquo;t let the image fool you, there is plenty of crime here and it is a no-go area for Whites.</p>
<p>Take a good look  &mdash;  this is what is being handed over to illegal colonists.</p>
<p>I wonder how much longer before the park is re-named in honor of (take your pick), Che, Mayor VillaLaRaza, Cesar Chavez, Ed Reyes or maybe the latest hispanic martyr &#8216;Por La Causa&rsquo; and Victim of Police Brutality, manuel reyes.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think it won&rsquo;t happen, a portion of historic Sunset Blvd. is now known as Cesar Chvez Blvd.</p>
