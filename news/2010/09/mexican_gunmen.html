<h1>Mexican Gunmen Fire at Border Patrol Agents</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KRGV-TV (Rio Grande Valley, Texas), September 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The FBI is investigating after armed men shot at border patrol agents on the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>A Border Patrol Spokesperson tells CHANNEL 5 NEWS agents chased a vehicle to the river&rsquo;s edge near Anzalduas Park this morning.</p>
<p>The driver swam to Mexico leaving behind his vehicle loaded with drugs. As agents were removing over a thousand pounds of marijuana armed men in Mexico began shooting at agents patrolling on boats.</p>
<p>The agents returned fire several times forcing the gunmen in Mexico to flee. No injuries were reported.<br>

		<p>The gunman were only trying to remove obstacles to the civil and human rights of the future mothers to be of our future hopes and citizenship.  They were clearing the way for migrants to make it safely to America to contribute to our vibrant, safe, diverse nation by giving us more brown anchor babies.</p>

<p>Well, this IS nothing NEW! Happens everyday. Those agents are set upon EVERYDAY!</p>
<p>There is now and has been for some time on the border a low intensity conflict, a dirty war, an intifada being conducted by the illegal aliens, the drug dealers and their mules, the whole mess.</p>
<p>Sheriff Arpaio is right. It is a war zone. He is right.<br>

		<p>As the cartels get intercepted more often, because of more Border Patrol agents on the border, I&rsquo;m looking for more confrontations like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering what the community organizer would do if several Border Patrol agents were ambushed and killed, as is often done to the Mexican Federales.  I&rsquo;m guessing the incident would have to be so outrageous it couldn&rsquo;t be ignored, with white militias threatening to go to the border area, before Obama would put troops there.</p>
<p>As with George Bush who also refused to protect the country, if one solitary terrorist who commits a homocide attack on US ctizens can be traced to coming across the southern border, our boy will be impeached in a heartbeat for refusing to do his job.</p>

<p>Oh.  I guess that means there&rsquo;s nothing to get excited about here.  No harm done, after all.  Back to your football games and sitcoms, White folks.<br>

		<p>It would appear that our border patrol officers can&rsquo;t shoot any better then our soldiers over here in Afghanistan. Hundreds, if not thousands of rounds expended in various gunfights over here and 3 wounded taliban are &#8220;rescued&#8221; or 2 killed!!! WFT! who teaches these kids to shoot?</p>

		<p>50,000 US troops remain in the country of Iraq for reasons no living American can adequately explain - yet this chaos on our border draws at best a tiny handful of Guardsmen at the whim of whomever holds office at that time, and more as a political stunt than anything. </p>
<p>This, like eveything to do with the &#8220;immigration issue&#8221; is a problem so easily solved that for that very reason the solution seems to escape each and every individual actually tasked with doing it. </p>

		<p>While we have Drug prohibition in this country, expect the border to become more violent.  In this matter, we have met the enemy and he is us. We need to end Prohibition now, remove all subsidies for illegal immigration, and use US troops to defend the US and not arbitrary allies elsewhere. This is all quite feasible - and I hope we do it during the reign of the next president. Till then, hold tight, it&rsquo;s going to be bad.</p>

		<p>If I had been there as a Border Patrol agent, there would be dead illegals floating in the river because when someone&rsquo;s shooting at me, I would shoot to kill in response. Anyone asking why would be told the number one reason why law-enforcement officers kill in the line of duty, and that is &#8220;Officer safety.&#8221; This is a war, it&rsquo;s time for our agents to start shooting like it. And no, I can tell everyone here from first hand experience that when someone&rsquo;s shooting at you, it&rsquo;s a High Intensity Conflict.</p>

<p>RANGER! what you meant was, what will he do WHEN it happens and it IS GONNA HAPPEN since the cartels have nothing to loose and lots to gain, and if their own police mean nothing to them, why should ours?</p>
