<h1>Police Spokeswoman Moved After Remarks on Fairgrounds Fights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel P. Finney, Des Moines Register, September 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Des Moines Police Chief Judy Bradshaw reassigned her department&rsquo;s spokeswoman Thursday, two weeks after Sgt. Lori Lavorato said it was &#8220;very possible&#8221; fights near the Iowa State Fairgrounds had racial overtones.</p>
<p>The move came as a part of a series of police command assignment changes announced to officers by e-mail Thursday, the details of which have not been made public.</p>
<p>Bradshaw, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, raised concerns about statements Lavorato made after a series of fights outside the fairgrounds last month.</p>
<p>A supplemental report about the Aug. 20 incident filed by Sgt. Dave Murillo said, &#8220;On-duty officers at the fairgrounds advise there was a group of 30 to 40 individuals roaming the fairgrounds openly calling it &#8216;beat whitey night.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>While answering questions from the news media three days later, Lavorato said, &#8220;It&rsquo;s all under investigation, but it&rsquo;s very possible it has racial overtones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police commanders later said they found no credible evidence the fights were racially motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had some real concerns with us making that leap and making a remark like that publicly,&#8221; Bradshaw told The Des Moines Register in an Aug. 26 interview. &#8220;That&rsquo;s a huge statement that, quite frankly, can provoke emotions on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are very sensitive to remarks like that, so I had some real grave concerns about us stepping out and I wanted to make certain that we were right to message the State Fair events that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lavorato, 36, a police public information officer since May 2009, will work in the department&rsquo;s traffic unit. Sgt. Jeff Edwards, 40, will transfer from the traffic unit to replace Lavorato effective Sept. 13.</p>
<p>Lavorato confirmed her new assignment, but declined to say whether the move was voluntary.</p>

		<p>I remember reading something about an Iowa city quite a few years ago,it might have been Des Moines, that was trying to recruit blacks to move there because the city,they said, was &#8220;too white&#8221;.Ill bet that whatever moron came up with that idea regrets it now.Too bad whoever started the black recruitment drive will not be a victim.</p>

		<p>There is a race war going on but so far only one side understands that the war has started. If white people ever get the idea that blacks are out to get them they will retaliate, once white people start to give as well as they have been getting then it will be a real war. </p>
<p>Cry havoc and unleash the dogs of war! That&rsquo;s what everyone is afraid of because once it starts it won&rsquo;t be a pretty sight. White people killed over a 100 million of our own kind in the last hundred years and no telling how many little yellow people. We do know how to make war.  </p>

		<p>Any time Whites speak the truth, they get punished.  As blacks become more and more intolerable, we will reach a flash point and victims such as this courageous White spokeswoman will have a huge outpouring of support.  </p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t there yet, otherwise Chief Bradshaw would have been forced to resign for her elitism against a member of our White Humanity.</p>

<p>They get rewarded with jobs and honorary degrees for doing the same thing that got this White woman reassigned.</p>

		<p>this attack on Whites by Blacks - at least 30-40 of them, had definite racial motives on the part of the Blacks to target and to injure Whites at the Iowa State Fair.</p>
<p>The De Moines Register had about 700 comments on it&rsquo;s site in the day after, not counting those comments &#8220;scrubbed&#8221; by the DMR as &#8220;too insensitive&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
The eyewitnesses and victims quoted in the comments and early reporting on this &#8220;Get Whitey Night&#8221; clearly reveal that Blacks tageted and assaulted Whites simply because they were Whitye. PERIOD! This is further confirmed on radio station WHO in De Moines, where radio host Jan Mickelson interviewed a host of victims and witnesses on his show, which nmay still be available for hearing in tyhe archives at the WHO website. </p>
<p>What comes out is that these were Hate Crimes against Whites committed by feral Blacks, that the media/political class is attempting to cover it up or rationalize it in non-racial terms, and that De Moines&rsquo; Lesbian politically-correct Police Chief and her palace guard are stretching every excuse and rationalization for this blantant set of Hate Crimes against Whites.  </p>
<p>By the way, Where is the national media?  NOWHERE.  However,. an alleged Hate Crime against a Black where he got into a fight with another White man who said the &#8220;N&#8221; word in the heat of the fight has received wall-to-wall coverage in Louisiana and nationally by the Associated Press. a One-on-One fight. That&rsquo;s national news.</p>

		<p>Remember when a petty thief got caught red-handed and shot up his &#8220;racist&#8221; co-workers at the beer distributor?  You heard about how racist you were for about a week or so then it disappeared?  I wonder if we stopped hearing about it because someone at the news desk was &#8220;reassigned&#8221; for speaking without all the facts.  </p>
<p>For some reason I doubt it.  It served its usefulness of making white people feel bad for thinking the kids who drowned in the Red River in Louisiana the same day couldn&rsquo;t swim because they&rsquo;re black.  &#8220;Racists&#8221; who think that way are liable to be shot to death at work by self-righteous blacks, white man.  Feel bad about yourself, and don&rsquo;t ever forget it.</p>

		<p>I invite people to notice how, more and more, institutionalized violence (cops, courts, laws, lawyers etc.) are becoming less and less relied upon to address black racist &#8220;crime&#8221;.  And more and more, non-institutionalized violence (gun ownership, carry permits, improved self-defense laws etc.) are being relied on instead.</p>
<p>Literally, the rule of law is breaking down in the US as people form de facto ethno-states without openly saying what is going on.  It&rsquo;s been going on, more or less, subconsciously for decades now.  But recently has become VERY conscious and more and more overt.</p>
<p>To be blunt, whites are not allowed in black run areas.  The police cannot protect you and, in many cases, refuse to protect you.  Outright ethnic cleansing as this exemplifies is kept from racial consciousness at all costs (notice this starting to fail).  In contrast, blacks who move into many white neighborhoods can expect to be gunned down with impunity in &#8220;self defense&#8221; when committing &#8220;crime&#8221;.  I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that this behavior isn&rsquo;t crime (it&rsquo;s war) and &#8220;self-defense&#8221; is, more and more, edging towards militarization of white neighborhoods.  We are talking millions and millions of guns here.</p>
<p>Noticing these things begs the question, when are people going to stop pretending this isn&rsquo;t what it is&hellip;.a racially motivated war started and maintained by black people.  That is not a rhetorical question.  I suspect the answer is a few months to a couple of years.  Not a good time in American history to be clueless.</p>

		<p>You know, my husband and I basically have the same views when it comes to race and double standards. The problem is I&rsquo;ve done much more research on these issues, and I think at times he thinks I exaggerate the problems we are facing. So I have taken to reading him articles from AmRen every night. For some reason, THIS article really struck a nerve with him, or perhaps it&rsquo;s the combination of articles I&rsquo;ve read to him from this site, but either way, I finally saw that spark of anger that I wish all whites would feel when it comes to stories like this.</p>
<p>To any self respecting white person, this story is nothing short of an outrage. If we don&rsquo;t stand together, we are doomed.</p>

		<p>I went to the police web site and it&rsquo;s a sight to behold.  Most of their photos are of blacks or Hispanics.</p>
<p>The police chief, as you would imagine, is a little wimpy looking thing that would probably faint if anybody dared to speak the truth again.</p>
<p>The number of women on the force appears to be excessive as well.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find an email address to the chief, so I could send her a long condemnation telling her what a coward and liar she is, so if anybody locates one I&rsquo;d appreciate knowing what it is.</p>
<p>Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t have a &#8220;whup whitey&#8221; night if these law enforcement cowards would tell the truth and hold them accountable for their abject racist actions.  But since they won&rsquo;t do that, they continue to place all whites in the Des Moines area in danger of black mob attacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean whomever is responsible for the fiasco is going to escape unscathed though, when the time comes, all of the victims will NOT be black or &#8220;other&#8221; quite a large number of Whites will be on the list too. Leave NO enemy behind you.</p>

		<p>This story again proves the theory that once the percentage of the black population of anything reaches a certain number they flex their muscle&rsquo;s and all hell breaks out. Just what that number is I don&rsquo;t think anyone is certain of. The City of Des Moines is between 9 and 10% black but the state is under 3%/ black. It is probably safe to say once anything becomes over 5% black be prepared for trouble. Imagine what life is like in the places and jobs in the country that are over 25% black? Vermont should be next,they sure could use a good dose of DIVERSITY.</p>

		<p>Police chiefs serve at the pleasure of politicians. This  chief has done what she must to enhance her career. I don&rsquo;t know what promotion they can give her now, since she&rsquo;s already chief&hellip;. perhaps a nice raise.  Maybe an appointment in the Obama administration. Maybe in charge of the Border patrol or something such.</p>
<p>Or look to seeing her become the police chief of a major city like Chicago or Los Angeles within the next few years. The reward for a &#8220;job well done&#8221;.  She could even go into politics herself.</p>
