<h1>Tradition Ends: No Michigan State Fair This Year</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, Washintgon Post, September 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Democratic Gov. Jennifer {snip} Granholm&rsquo;s decision makes Michigan the only Midwestern state and one of few nationwide without a state fair.</p>
<p>The Michigan State Fair had been a state tradition for 160 years and held at Eight Mile and Woodward, within Detroit city limits, since 1905. But the fair had been running deficits and needed $360,000 from the state in 2008 to cover losses. Fewer than 220,000 people passed through last year. At its peak in 1966, the fair drew 1 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Like those in other states, the Michigan fair had its roots in agrarian fairs in Europe, where farmers met to discuss farming techniques and equipment. As waves of immigrants came to the U.S., they influenced the fairs, which added ethnic foods and other attractions.</p>
<p>One thing that hurt the Michigan fair was the state&rsquo;s economy. Michigan&rsquo;s unemployment rate of 15.2 percent led the nation in August 2009 when the last fair was held. Detroit&rsquo;s jobless rate is about 30 percent.</p>
<p>But part of the problem also seems to have been the fair&rsquo;s inability to successfully marry its agrarian roots with money-making entertainment as other state fairs have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;State fairs, like the one in Iowa, attendance is up or steady because they have been made as major tourist attractions,&#8221; said Pam Riney-Kehrberg, professor of agriculture history and rural studies at Iowa State University. &#8220;In states where they haven&rsquo;t been able to cultivate a special ethos for the fair, numbers are going down.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He thought one problem was the fair&rsquo;s reliance on state subsidies because when those ended, the fair essentially collapsed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have any government support here, and that is critical to our success,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Michigan, agriculture remains the No. 2 industry behind manufacturing, and the state is among the nation&rsquo;s leaders in production of sugar beets, cherries, apples, corn and other produce. Smaller fairs continue to celebrate that heritage, and at least one appears to have benefited from the state fair&rsquo;s closing.</p>

<p>Iowa&rsquo;s state fair attendance won&rsquo;t be high for much longer, especially after this year.  That&rsquo;s because Des Moines is turning into Detroit.</p>
<p>The Missouri State Fair is in Sedalia, which is almost all-white, with a small contingent of Hispanics for the local sweatshops.  Location, location, location&hellip;</p>

They could try moving it from an urban setting to a more agrarian local. I bet attendance would rise without the need for distractions and gimmicks.</p>

		<p>I notice that Michigan choose to do away with the fair rather than admit its traditional location is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>That might raise questions as to WHY it&rsquo;s no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>Of course, a suspicious person might look for a resurrection of the tradition, a few years later, at a new location within the state, by an &#8220;unrelated&#8221; group of people who &#8220;just want to see the tradition preserved but don&rsquo;t live near Detroit so they hold it local to their {conveniently all white} own neighborhood instead&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mysteriously, it will be a smashing success despite the new location.</p>

		<p>My family never missed the Michigan State Fair when I was growing up. I can appreciate that the Detroit location had lost its appeal to out-of-towners who were reluctant to contribute to local criminals such as armed robbers, car thieves, crooked cops and Black politicians, but the promoters could have moved the fair to a safer location rather than shut it down. </p>
<p>You can bet that Monroe County would appreciated the business of up to a million fair-goers. Dundee would be my first choice of towns to be the site of the the new fair. It&rsquo;s rural, but it&rsquo;s close to Ann Arbor, Toledo and the Detroit Metro Area. It is easily accessible by interstate highways. It has a Cabellas, so it is already a popular destination for the kind of people who go to state fairs. It has local funding for additional motels, RV parks and camping facilities. Most importantly, Monroe County is 94% White and less than 2% Black and Dundee is 96% White and .7% Black.</p>
<p>Locate the fair in a place with a racial demographic  like  that and it will return to its former glory.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm - I wonder what happened in Detroit between 1966 and 2009 to cause such a huge drop in attendance? I&rsquo;ll keep on thinking about it, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come up with a reason eventually!!!</p>
<p>&ldquo;State fairs, like the one in Iowa, attendance is up or steady because they have been made as major tourist attractions,&rdquo; </p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t last long. As the stories on this site illustrated last week, the Iowa state fair has a growing &#8220;diverse&#8221; attendance now.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s basically a big tragedy.  However, it is the location that caused the drop.  Smart people in Michigan avoided anything below about 10 mile when I lived there.</p>
<p>The 4 H fair up around the Lapeer and Ortonville area is always crowded.  If they moved the state fair it would survive.  Keep in mind, only white people are interested in farm-things, even if they are not farmers.  </p>
<p>Why should black people be interested in hog races, candy apples, Americana music shows or tractors?</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s Ok to have a state celebration whites are uncomfortable to even show up and attending or perhaps are simply unsafe it, it&rsquo;s not Ok to move the fair to another location. That could upset black folks.</p>

		<p>Here in North Carolina in the People&rsquo;s Republic of Chapel Hill they used to have a street festival called Apple Chill. I went a few times and it was very nice, food vendors, crafts, music, etc. Well, a few years back they started having trouble with gang &#8220;activity&#8221; towards the end of the day when things were winding down. Did they crack down on the lowlifes and the gangs? Of course not. These good liberals caved and now it&rsquo;s no more Apple Chill. </p>

		<p>They should of moved the fair elsewhere and not care what others thought.  Too many white people feel they have an obligation to take care of non-white people.  I do believe increasing black attendence drove away white vendors and fair-goers to the point they had to close.</p>

		<p>I used to live in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale, in the Eight Mile/Woodward area, right near those Jewish cemeteries (those of you who live there will know what I&rsquo;m talking about).  The State Fair was just a short trip down Woodward.  It wasn&rsquo;t really that far into Detroit.  I probably could have walked there from my house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to the Michigan State Fair lots of times.  My earliest memory of the fair was in the mid-70s, when I went with my mother, my grandmother, and my sister who was in a stroller.  </p>
<p>I agree with Old White Jim.  Forget Oakland and Wayne Counties.  Monroe is ideal.</p>
<p>Well, since I live in Wayne County, Ohio, there&rsquo;s the upcoming Wayne County Fair to look forward to&hellip;.</p>

		<p>State and county fairs must be relatively cheap day trips for families to take these days, and there&rsquo;s no reason Detroit would be any different from any other locale except that it&rsquo;s Detroit  &mdash;  which, of course, says everything.  Any event considered traditionally white is probably targeted by ghetto blacks who come to pickpocket, rob, rape, and batter.  The cost of security alone must be skyrocketing, and then there&rsquo;s always the ghetto-lottery lawsuits that come from blacks being &#8220;injured&#8221; on rides or frightened by a neighing horse.</p>

		<p>The attendence peaked at 1 million in 1966. Then in 1967 the Detroit riots occured followed by the long reign of mayor Coleman Young &amp; out of control crime. I&rsquo;m surprised it lasted this long. They should move it away from Detroit to a safe area &amp; keep it going. The same thing happened in Alabama to the state fair in Birmingham &amp; it was finally moved to a safer area about 20 miles away.</p>

		<p>Just so we have a ray of hope, there is one pretty much all-white affair in which we can celebrate our heritage and these events show no sign of fading away or of being invaded by blacks or Latinos - Renaissance/medieval fairs!</p>
<p>I currently live in a major city that is now something like 70% non-white.  I can go days and days and days without seeing more than 3-4 other white people, but at the Ren. Fair -  it&rsquo;s like a white world once again.  Thousands of whites, all together, celebrating and having fun with things that afro-centric and amerindians have zero interest in.</p>
<p>Jousting, stained glass, troubadors, old-style clothing and outfits galore, oftentimes worn even by spectators.  I went to my first ren. fair last year.  I will going every year from now on!</p>
<p>We must all go and support these if for no other reason than to expose your kids to a white sanctuary.</p>

		<p>Every nice white attraction just has to be ruined.  It&rsquo;s been that way for decades.  Chicago used to have an attraction called &#8220;Riverview.&#8221;  My mother had to stop going there when blacks started attending in the late &rsquo;40s, early &rsquo;50s.  When a black woman threatened to stab her for no reason, that was the last time my mother went.  In California there are amusement parks such as Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm and Magic Mountain.  Back in the &rsquo;70s, they were great places to visit.  Last time I went, they were crowded with rude, pushy nonwhites shoving ahead of others in line.  The experience was totally ruined.  Everything whites enjoy just HAS to be destroyed.  It makes me sick.</p>

		<p>What Detroit needs is a gradual gentrification program.  Believe it, deliberately or not, the strategy is working in Washington, D.C.  That&rsquo;s why the city has recorded far fewer murders in recent years.  The crack wars are almost a thing of the past.  Put simply, D.C. is more white.  </p>

		<p>Until the late 1950&rsquo;s / early 1960&rsquo;s, there was a reason that Southern state fairs had &#8220;Colored Days&#8221; when only minorities were allowed to attend. Of course the state of Michigan would rather shut the whole thing down than to relocate it to a much safer (read: rural) area. </p>
<p>&ldquo;State fairs, like the one in Iowa, attendance is up or steady because they have been made as major tourist attractions,&rdquo; said Pam Riney-Kehrberg, professor of agriculture history and rural studies at Iowa State University. &ldquo;In states where they haven&rsquo;t been able to cultivate a special ethos for the fair, numbers are going down.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What do you do to cultivate a special ethos for Detroit, issue every attendee without a felony record a fully automatic AK-47? Charter special buses that load up people 35 miles away so they don&rsquo;t have to worry about their cars being boosted or destroyed? Even the mayor of Detroit had his tires and rims stolen off of an executive security vehicle. (On drudge and msnbc September 2nd, 2010). If someone wanted to try a privately run fair in the sticks, but near an interstate, they might be able to make a go of it. Especially if it is on private property you ask the attendees to openly carry weapons. </p>

		<p>The window of opportunity to move the fair is long past. Here in Buffalo they moved the Italian Fest from the west side of Buffalo to north Buffalo in the late 80&rsquo;s. The publicized reason was they wanted to be near a business district. Reality was marked by out of control hispanic gangs causing low attendance and the simple fact it was no longer an Italian neigborhood. I don&rsquo;t recall any racist smears labeled at the event organizers. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been like that at the Maryland State Fair for at least two decades. It got markedly worse about twenty years ago when the Light Rail opened - runs right past the fairgrouds. Cherry Hill to Hunt Vally (projects to horse country)</p>
<p>My contention for years has been to move it far enough away from any urban center to keep ALL of the rifraf out. If it&rsquo;s not convienient it will, eventually, return to ita agrarian roots. Yeah!</p>

		<p>The truth is, fairs are traditionally a white affair. Few blacks who attend fairs today have any interest in agriculture, but they instead want to rob, assault, rape or even kill whites. The recent incident at the Des Moines state fair is proof of that. Hordes of blacks or non-whites attacking whites is a guaranteed way to put an end to any event where the public gathers. No sane white would enter Detroit at night. That was why attendance dropped off, and if the fair resumes it will be moved to a safer area if ever. The fact is, whites are soon going to be unable to go anywhere in peace, and that will lead to an awakening among us that many non-whites are going to regret, literally.</p>

		<p>For years, my family would load us into the car and drive &#8220;into the city&#8221; of Columbus, Ohio to the state fair. Even as a kid, I remember it being in a sketchy part of town. I remember my mom always telling us to keep the car doors locked and not talk to anyone until we got inside the (relative) safety of the fairgrounds.</p>
<p>By the time I was in high school, it had become a much more dangerous place. We couldn&rsquo;t walk around with our friends b/c there were too many creepy/gangster types roaming around the fairgrounds. As soon as the sun began setting, we&rsquo;d quickly make our exit. </p>
<p>Eventually it just got to be too much. Even in the daytime there would be groups of people (guys and girls) roaming in packs, picking fights. You spent half your time clutching your bags, expecting to be jumped and mugged by them. Or they&rsquo;d cut in lines and all the LL Bean types who&rsquo;d brought their kids to the fair would just stand there and not say (can&rsquo;t blame them) - heck, we didn&rsquo;t say anything either. I can&rsquo;t say they were all black and hispanic, some were whites,  but it was too much and by the time I was in college, we just quit going. </p>
