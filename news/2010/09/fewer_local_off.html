<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-09-14-immigration_N.htm?csp=34news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=F">Fewer Local Officers Become Immigration Agents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Gomez, USA Today, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal program that deputizes local police officers to act as immigration agents has seen a sharp drop in interest from law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Seventy-two agencies have signed up for the program since it began in 2002, training more than 1,100 local law enforcement officers in 26 states to perform immigration checks and begin deportations. Nine agencies signed on last year and one so far in 2010.</p>
<p>Jim Denney, a former Sutter County, Calif., sheriff who is executive director of the California State Sheriffs&rsquo; Association, says local departments have been turned off by the controversy that comes with the program, known as 287(g). Only four agencies in California participate.</p>
<p>Denney says the program makes Hispanics suspicious of police and less willing to cooperate to solve crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has to be a level of trust that both sides enjoy in order to work together,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are going to be times when we have to rely on illegal immigrants to conduct an investigation, and they are going to be concerned if the first thing they think is we&rsquo;re going to round them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program has supporters, including Lexington County, S.C., Sheriff James Metts, whose department joined this year.</p>
<p>Metts says his area&rsquo;s agriculture industry has drawn a large influx of Hispanics and that he has seen &#8220;several murders, gang activity, drug activity, coming in with the Hispanic population.&#8221;</p>
<p>His office did not provide statistics but cited cases in which illegal immigrants were suspects in violent crimes and a 2008 study that found 8.5% of the people in his jail were in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Richard Rocha, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), says part of the reason for the decline in interest in the program is the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law enforcement agencies across the country are faced with limited resources, and in some instances the 287(g) program may not be a viable option,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>A less labor-intensive ICE program, Secure Communities, is more popular with police agencies. It is in use in 574 jurisdictions in 30 states. Under that program, everyone booked into a jail has fingerprints sent to the Department of Homeland Security to determine immigration status. Follow-through on illegal immigrants is done by ICE, not the local police.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Police departments trying to avoid &ldquo;controversy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway, because departments are being downsized all over the country and will continue to decline as the financial picture worsens.</p>
<p>Also, I read an article today that said civil pensions are being either reduced all over the country or the governing authority is requiring employees to work more years for a reduced amount of money.</p>
<p>In some cases people already on retirement were getting cuts in their retirement payments, which is going to be the norm by 2012, I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
<p>Law enforcement departments always have the largest budgets, so they&rsquo;ll be hit the hardest.  Aware of this, MANY department heads and sheriffs and chiefs of police are issuing veiled threats about not responding to crimes if their forces are reduced.</p>
<p>Of all the civil servants it is the police who detest giving up one iota of power the most, because they&rsquo;re so accustomed to enjoying bloated budgets that enable them to be the 800 pound gorilla in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>With decreased manpower, and growing street gang violence, along with probable vigilante groups in a couple of years, in addition to well-armed militias, the police are going to have to start giving a bit more respect than they&rsquo;re used to in order to keep from being challenged constantly by one armed group or another.</p>
<p>The world of 2012 throughout the West, but especially the US, will be close to a Mad Max scenario.  Crime and violence will be rampant. </p>

		<p>Ice #1, well put, and I agree whole-heartedly. Many people I know in this rural area of Georgia have been operating under the &#8216;plan for wild west days&rsquo; idea, which means guarding your money, your food, your property, your family against the chaos and lawless that they believe is coming, and coming soon. I keep being surprised by learning about people who have, unknown to others, been stashing weapons, ammunition, food, fuel, etc., and making hard-nosed plans for what they (and I) believe is coming.</p>
<p>The more cultures trying to exist in one country, the liberal blanket of touchy-feely, bleeding heart laws, along with the economic shake-down by ours and other governments assure that there will be lawless pandemonium in the America&rsquo;s future. You can see it beginning now. It will be long, ugly, and inevitably, the death of this nation.<br>
