<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11295557">Cuts Could Damage Race Relations, Warns Diane Abbott</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, September 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Planned spending cuts could set back race relations by a generation and risk social &#8220;instability&#8221;, Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott has warned.</p>
<p>The cuts could hit ethnic minorities and women harder than other groups, she told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme.</p>
<p>And she called for ethnic and gender monitoring to be carried out when public bodies axe jobs.</p>
<p>The five leadership contenders are making their final pitch to Labour MPs, members and trade unionists.</p>
<p>Many will have already cast their vote, with the winner to be announced at Labour&rsquo;s annual conference later this month.</p>
<p>Ms Abbott, who is seen as the most left-wing of the five candidates, warned that a &#8220;last in, first out&#8221; approach to redundancies would hit black and female workers particularly hard.</p>
<p>She called for new rules to ensure local authorities and quangos are &#8220;mindful&#8221; of the race and gender distribution of any job losses announced in response to Treasury-imposed budget restrictions.</p>
<p>Ms Abbott, who was Britain&rsquo;s first black female MP, said: &#8220;Black (people) and ethnic minorities are predominantly employed in the public sector, particularly women.</p>
<p>&#8220;My concern is that the progress black and ethnic minority workers have made in employment is relatively recent and if there have to be big cuts, it will be &#8216;last in, first out&rsquo; and these cuts will fall disproportionately not just on women but on black and ethnic minority workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the public sector cuts have the potential to set back race relations and black and ethnic minority communities by a generation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well, Ms. Abott has a point.  Pulling back the level of racial blackmail payments could certainly raise the level of racial violence, not only in the UK but here as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m well armed.  I could live with that. Too bad nobody in the UK is similarly situated</p>

		<p>Well, if they wouldn&rsquo;t discriminate in favor of non-whites, for government jobs, in the first place, then non-whites would not be overrepresented among those getting laid off.</p>
<p>To represent the mass recruitment of non-whites in government as &#8220;progress&#8221; in employment reveals a sick mentality.  Those people are not productively employed and they serve no real useful purpose; they were installed in order to rule over the native white population through massive layers of bureaucracy.</p>

		<p>Here in NJ 25% of public employees are black compared to 13% of the population (last figures I saw).  The black middle class depends on public sector jobs, which is why there are fewer and fewer &#8220;civil servants&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The United Kingdom should only have indigineous British in their civil service.  Why in heaven&rsquo;s name does the United Kingdom import foreign public employees?  And if you dare lay them off does the UK become the Ignited Kingdom?</p>

		<p>Rest assured, the minority hires in the &#8220;public sector&#8221; are also the least competent and most surly just as they are here. As one of the few upsides of a down economy, it would be great if it could happen in America as well where affirmative action, EEOC hires pretend to &#8220;job&#8221; in positions for which they are in no way qualified. </p>

		<p>Britain&rsquo;s welfare state spawned this nightmare. Where do you work in Britain if you arent a highly educated business student or an heir of wealth? </p>
<p>In the public sector, if you work at all? Unemployment plagues white working class for years; now immigrants too discover Britain not land of opportunity except for some elite college grads and shopkeepers. Islam discourages women in particular, and even men, from high-skill tech or independent research: claims are made to the contrary. The history of Islam is not of innovation and inclusion of other cultures&rsquo; knowledge. It&rsquo;s of plaigiarism and superficial use of non-Islamic sources. </p>
<p>The spending in Britain should be curbed for reasons far beyond impact on immigrants,legal and otherwise. </p>
<p>Thatcher did this 30 years ago and reprieved Britain. Tony Blair and Brown have pulled in more immigrants, spent more on welfare and NHS, and now Labour brown skinned MPs whine. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the impact of Pakistan&rsquo;s flood&rsquo;s lady? On Scottish white shepherds? Bring a discrimination suit against Allah!</p>

		<p>Most of these jobs were only invented by white &#8216;diversity conscious&rsquo; liberal management to allow low achieving black minorities to be fast tracked in the first place. Most public sector jobs - especially in local council offices- are often given over to idiots - white and black alike. But you ever have a problem and get an African or Pakistani on the phone, and boy, your problems are only just beginning.  <br>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t one of our own stellar diversity hires threaten Gov. Christie of NJ in a similar manner? Frankly I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re all<br>
coming out into the open like this. There is a definite mood coalescing among whites everywhere. I notice it when I talk to people, on the comments boards (which is why they close them now) and even in the statements of public officials (a useful lagging indicator). Good. The boil is lanced and the pus is coming out. Can&rsquo;t wait for the disinfectant.</p>

		<p>Same here.  Whenever I have to deal with a &#8220;civil servant&#8221; by phone, you can immediately tell when you&rsquo;ve gotten a black on the other end.  I hang up without even giving my name.  I&rsquo;d rather keep trying and wait another 15 minutes and get a white person on the line.  That way I know they are maybe at least minimally competent, minimally interested, and minimally unlikely to throw it in the round file due to my being White, and saying it was &#8220;misplaced&#8221;.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take a a few times to learn this.  Blacks often are surly, angry that you disturbed their day and expect them to work, often don&rsquo;t have a clue about the regulations or process you are inquiring about, you can&rsquo;t understand them half the time, and all too often your paperwork or request &#8220;becomes lost&#8221;.  Don&rsquo;t you doubt for a second that THEY can tell YOU are white, just as YOU can tell THEY are black on the other end of the phone.  I was a government employee for some years.  Blacks didn&rsquo;t have a clue, wanted to yak rather than work, got surly when expected to perform or answer the phone, and were way, way nicer to other blacks than to white customers.  It&rsquo;s a fact.  </p>

She says: <br>
&ldquo;My concern is that the progress black and ethnic minority workers have made in employment is relatively recent and if there have to be big cuts, it will be &lsquo;last in, first out&rsquo; and these cuts will fall disproportionately not just on women but on black and ethnic minority workers.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
What she is calling &#8220;Progress&#8221; is not REAL progress at all.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;progress&#8221; that was handed to them, not specifically earned.  With governments around the world finally realizing that they have to tighten belts it is no wonder gimme positions are in the crosshairs.  The idea that this will set their community back a full generation is not such a surprise when you consider a generation in most black communities is usually half as long as it is in white families.<br>
 <br>
Also, Last In/First Out is NORMAL business.  Keeping the experienced, vetted and trusted longer term employees is exactly what is supposed to happen.  There is no fiscal reason to do it any other way and doing it any other way would be a waste of taxpayer resources.  No company can remain solvent during hard times by tossing out the longer term employees to retain a crew of rookies.  What sense is there to this woman&rsquo;s kind of thinking?  Is it entitlement?  Are these Last Ins owed something for being only recently hired?  Especially since it usually takes years before a new employee&rsquo;s hide starts to turn a buck (or a pound) for the employer.  Only fast food can make turnover profitable.<br>
 <br>
Having a front row seat for the fall of the UK is unsettling.  If this clown gets her way, I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;ll see a lot of limeys bidding tally ho to the old country, their ethnic lands skillfully stolen from them.  How I pray I am wrong.<br>

		<p>I have worked in the British civil service and seen this sort of thing happening. There was this loud mouth Indian guy that would always throw his weight around, I think I was the only one on the floor that would challenge him.</p>
<p>And of course I was a closet racist as a result. He filed the most numerous complaints against people seemly unable to square away a dispute with a co worker over a coffee and doughnut.</p>
<p>He was promoted again and again way over his ability, department heads were only to glad to promote him out from under them.</p>
<p>He was universally hated by all but no one was prepared to stand up to him. Ah the joys of diversity.</p>
<p>AS for Diane Abbot, shes of the loonie left, only standing due to the fact the Labour party couldnt have a leadership contest with only white males and thats the truth</p>

		<p>Most shops in the UK are owned by Asians - including low achieving muslim pakistanis and Bangladeshis (after all someone has to run the chicken shops and drive Taxis to ferry around the Indigenour whites every Friday and Saturday night to the pubs and clubs and back home in a drunken vomit and urine soaked state). I dont see how this dunce of an MP can say most non-whites are employed in the public sector. What she really means is most <b>BLACKS<b> are employed in the public sector. Thats who she is looking out for, thats who she represents and thats what she is. She wants to scare the non-blacks into an alliance with blacks againts the indigenous whites. Its amazing that this woman graduated from Cambridge univeristy.</b></b></p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see much of a future for Britain.  Not only in England, but also Scotland and Wales virtually everyone seems to have gone completely wobbly on race.  If the government weren&rsquo;t so bent on suppressing all natural-born versions of Enoch Powell from speaking freely, the Brits might have a chance.  However, this is unlikely to happen.  </p>
<p>If I may add:  Where is the Monarchy?  Why is it that from Her Majesty the Queen on down, nobody in the royal family can be heard?  The silence is bloody deafening.</p>

		<p>Here in the United States it seems that most of the growth in the black middle class is due to the artificial life support system of government hiring.  Government has a monopoly over everything it does, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about efficiency or competitiveness.  The government can &#8220;afford&#8221; to hire more blacks than private industry can.  It&rsquo;s only taxpayer dollars, after all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the only blacks you see at the Tea Parties are a handful of tokens on stage.  Black people know that without government taxing white people and using the proceeds to fund their paychecks and pensions they&rsquo;d be a lot worse off.<br>

		<p>Blacks in the USA also heavily rely on government jobs (local and federal). I would not be surprised if upwards of 70% of blacks are either 1) permanently on some form of welfare, 2) employed by a government agency or 3) in jail. The media is hiding the true amount of tax payer money that goes to support blacks.</p>

		<p>Um yeah losing your job sucks for eveybody, only blacks pose a threat to &#8220;national stability&#8221; when their do nothing welfare jobs are threatened. Everything with them is always a veiled threat, always hints about riots and street violence, never any argument about why they deserve their gloriously pampered lifestyles courtesy of white taxpayers when they contibute nothing to anything.</p>

		<p>Diane Abbott is, to many, a bumbling hypocrite, a poseur, who when stood up to, disintegrates into wobbling jelly. A typical member of the New Labour elite, allowing our education system to fail miserably, while packing her son off to private education. She is a left-wing clone, ticking all the politically correct  &#8216;progressive&rsquo; boxes as she slithers up the greasy political pole. What on earth does she know about real work? Less than zero, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her stirring the pot on behalf of her &#8216;brothers&rsquo; &amp; &#8216;sisters&rsquo;. If a white politician made such racially specific comments he&rsquo;d find himself not only ostracised, but probably boiled alive! Such is the penetration of cultural Marxism throughout the beleaguered UK. </p>
<p>  What she is good at is lecturing white Britons on their manifold failings, while studiously avoiding any mention of the staggering levels of black crime, rampant misogyny, absentee fathers or the general mayhem young black men &#8216;enrich&rsquo; us with. Like all of the left, she has a pathological aversion to the truth, in case it conflicts with the multicultural, rainbow utopia the white British (& settled immigrants) are compelled to now live in. Only in a madhouse could she be given the slightest credence. The Brits used to have a hard-nosed, sardonic sense of humour that would have laughed the Abbotts of this world out of court, sadly, we appear to have mislaid it.<br>
