			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordan Fabian, The Hill, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the midst of swirling rumors of a soon-to-be published bombshell story, New York Gov. David Paterson (D) said Wednesday that criticism of him has been motivated by his race.</p>
<p>Paterson, who is black and blind, said on Imus in the Morning that he has been the subject of &#8220;outrageous rumors&#8221; the past two weeks centering around a supposedly damaging report to be published in the New York Times this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re not really calling for different types of conduct and what I think is that I have been depicted in a way that has been racialized, sexualized, hyper-sexualized and dissolute,&#8221; Paterson, referring to his critics, told host Don Imus on Fox Business Network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m black, I&rsquo;m blind, and I&rsquo;m still alive,&#8221; Paterson said. &#8220;Now how much better do they want me to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Paterson has said his critics are racially tinged.</p>
<p>When it was reported last year that Democratic officials were trying to push him out of this year&rsquo;s election, Paterson said &#8220;We&rsquo;re not in the post-racial period.</p>

		<p>So he&rsquo;s black, blind, and breathing.  That trumps all other &#8220;qualifications&#8221;, I suppose!<br>
This man, on taking office, all but bragged about his and his wife&rsquo;s promiscuity and I don&rsquo;t remember what all else.  And, now, how dare us judge him on that and any more allegations of the same!</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right. Of course it is racially motivated. </p>
<p>Who of the whites owning and writing for the NYT really wants to be subject to an afrovoodoo governor? The NYT knows that their white daughters see a black in position of high prestige and power, and then they will accidentally believe that powerful blacks make desirable mates. The white NYT  employees do not what high yella mulatto grandbabies. White Mo Dowd doesn&rsquo;t date afros.</p>
<p>And Patterson doesn&rsquo;t look 100% black. He&rsquo;s far too light skined, almost yellow. He robbed a large dose of European white blood from somebody, probably a liberal white woman. Why can&rsquo;t we see an 100% afro as a governor. How about James Clyburn from S.C.? He would tear the roof off. That&rsquo;s an authentic, kepp&rsquo;n it real African American! Just take look.</p>
<p>NYT supported Obama just because he was the alternative to so called conservative Republican Bush, not because they wanted mulatto grandbabies, but that&rsquo;s what they will get for being traitors against their own white race. But their alternative was white race traitor McCain, so who can blame them for going insane?</p>
<p>All race relations are racially motivated.  Patterson&rsquo;s critique from NYT will be racially motivated, just as all black on white crime is racially motivated.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the test for black on white hate crime: Did said black perp have a racial identity or conscious awareness of being black? Does he know the difference between Martin Luther King and George Washington? Did said black perp know his vicitm was white?</p>
<p>The answers are always yes, which confirms that all black on white crime is racially motivated and is therefore hate crime.<br>

<p>How about good enough to be an honest, incorruptible governor who isn&rsquo;t an embarrassment to his office?  It&rsquo;s asking a lot, I know.  But you can always brush away criticism by screeching &#8220;Racism!&#8221;<br>

		<p>Interesting.  I hadn&rsquo;t known that Paterson was blind.</p>
<p>But having listened to some of his utterances, I have to wonder whether blindnesss is not his only handicap.</p>
<p>Of course, given the state of New York&rsquo;s government and finances, whether Paterson is a Dr. Thomas Sowell or a slack-jawed dolt probably doesn&rsquo;t matter. Paterson&rsquo;s ship of state had already hit the iceberg long before the poor sod ended up in the governor&rsquo;s mansion.</p>

<p>America you get what you deserve, keep settling for fools and fools will rule.</p>
<p>You entire government is committed to putting fools into positions of achievement when they haven&rsquo;t been qualified to do anything close to their positions.</p>

		<p>Mario Cuomo&rsquo;s liberal tax and spend policies drove me out of New York City for good in the late 1980&rsquo;s.  We had over a million people on welfare back then, and I got sick of paying for it. Now that New York State is in even worse shape thanks to the clowns those people keep choosing for governor, it&rsquo;s motto should be changed from &#8220;Empire State&#8221; to &#8220;The State which never learns.&#8221;  I&rsquo;ll always be graateful for having grown up in New York City, but you could&rsquo;nt pay me enough to go near that state again.</p>

		<p>The only negative &#8220;racially motivated&#8221; articles that ever appear in the New York Times are the ones that bash whites.  The truth is that nearly all the New York state politicians, regardless of race or party, deserve all the damaging reports the New York Times can muster.<br>
