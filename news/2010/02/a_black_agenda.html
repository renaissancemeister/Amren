			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael K. Fauntroy, Huffington Post, February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A spat has developed among some prominent black leaders about the extent to which President Barack Obama should be pushed to give special attention to African American issues. {snip}</p>
<p>They, in supporting their position, have erected a ridiculous straw man to under-gird their position: President Obama is not the President of black America and should not be held to that standard. {snip}</p>
<p>I believe this argument is a straw man because I have yet to hear one reasonable, credible person argue that Obama should be the President of Black America or solely any other segment of the nation. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that issues of particular importance to different constituencies should not be given extra attention. Special problems require special attention. {snip}</p>
<p>The black community certainly has some responsibility for its current situation. The reality is, however, that with some black communities suffering from unemployment rates above 30 percent (In October 2009, the jobless rate for black males age 16-to-24 was 34.5 percent in my home city of Washington, D.C., a place that has made out reasonably well in the current recession and Milwaukee, Wisconsin has recently had a Black male unemployment rate hovering around 50 percent) and dangerously high dropout and criminal justice supervision rates, a unique, special, and acute problem has been established that requires attention above and beyond what our leaders  &mdash;  elected and appointed, and without regard to race are willing to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Black unemployment won&rsquo;t get significantly reversed by treating it the same as white unemployment. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, 10.7 percent of white men over the age of 20 were unemployed; 17.3 percent of black males were unemployed at the same time. White women over the age of 20 have an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, while 13.3 percent of black women are jobless (this is a devastating number given the disproportionate number of single-woman headed households in the black community). Whites between the ages of 16-19 had an unemployment rate of 24.1 percent; the black unemployment rate for same aged blacks was 43.5 percent.</p>
<p>Groups of Americans, whether organized along ideological, religious, cultural, business, or other kinds of lines can, and do, ask the president for special attention to their issues. African Americans, however, are expected to sit in a corner and wait for the President to get around to their concerns whenever it&rsquo;s convenient. {snip}</p>
<p>America should not fear a &#8220;black agenda&#8221; any more than it would fear an &#8220;environmental agenda&#8221; or an &#8220;education agenda&#8221;. As I see it, the &#8220;black agenda&#8221; is simply about making sure that some of the most acute issues facing black communities across the country are respected and acted upon. Black leaders who run from a &#8220;black agenda&#8221; to protect the &#8220;black President&#8221; need to be reassessed by those who put them in their positions.<br>

		<p>I thought all these problems were going to go away simply because we elected a half-black President.  High dropout rate?  They said there would be an &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; of black students putting their noses to the grindstone because they had the hope of having a partially black President.</p>

		<p>Maybe with a million more years of evolution blacks will be able to compete at the levels of other races.  Currently western cultures are just too competitve for blacks to be successful.  Of course the left is trying to bring things to a third world level through the elimination of any sort of standards so it&rsquo;s possible that some western nations may devolve into simpler cultures that don&rsquo;t value any achievement.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The black community certainly has some responsibility for its current situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nope, &ldquo;sir&rdquo;  Comrade Fauntroy, &ldquo;the black community,&rdquo; as is such, holds all responsibility &ldquo;for its current situation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What other group has not suffered far worse, in other lands, from such a horror as American &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; and not thrived?</p>
<p>Tell it to the Jews or Russians, or for that matter, to the Germans after both world wars that saw what happened to all in Europe as a matter of &ldquo;historical&rdquo; casualty. Tell it to the Spaniards or Greeks who suffered under Islam for centuries; or to the Romans, who had an empire destroyed by that cult&rsquo;s beginnings. Maybe, you might instruct Ukrainians and Russians on the joys the Mongols brought them, and how that hindered them from getting atomic weapons or a space program, as well?</p>
<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>This is the future of  &ldquo;African Americans,&rdquo; if they really ever get what they want:</p>

<p>I agree that the problems of, and the problems caused by, black Americans are particularly acute.  Here is a solution (as much as there can be one).</p>
<p>1.  Eliminate welfare (AFDC, Medicaid, food stamps, housing subsidies, etc.) for anyone who has had a child out of wedlock, or who has been on the dole for more than three years.</p>
<p>2.  Kick out the illegal aliens so there are jobs available that marginally educated blacks can do.</p>
<p>No liberal, sobbing about the plight of blacks, will ever agree to (1) or (2).<br>

<p>But later he writes:</p>

<p>Hmmm, funny, but I have yet to hear one reasonable, credible person argue that African Americans should sit in a corner and wait for the President to get around to their concerns whenever it&rsquo;s convenient.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. I&rsquo;m sure it makes perfect sense to this writer and his followers.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;As I see it, the &#8216;black agenda&rsquo; is simply about making sure that some of the most acute issues facing black communities across the country are respected and acted upon&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;black agenda&rsquo; is about crushing Whites and stripping them of their wealth.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;ll never figure out is that they&rsquo;re merely the Hostile Elite&rsquo;s useful idiots, entirely expendable, whose sole purpose is to act as a battering ram against White Americans in order to eliminate them or decimate their numbers.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Black leaders who run from a &#8216;black agenda&rsquo; to protect the &#8216;black President&rsquo; need to be reassessed by those who put them in their positions&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Paid-off black leaders and black politicians have long ago sold their own people out.  If they truly represented black interests, they would demand that the Southern border be sealed immediately.</p>
<p>As blacks are being diverted and directed to keep ever vigilant against White Racism and be on the lookout for The Great White Bigot, they&rsquo;re being pushed out of Section 8 housing, menial jobs and schools by the burgeoning New Americans  &mdash;  fecund hispanics. </p>
<p>In many places in California, hispanics are already flexing their political muscles and  none of their plans include blacks.  You can bet there is no place in the mythical mestizo &#8216;azatlan&rsquo; for blacks.</p>
<p>From NumbersUSA, on reducing immigration, here are a few grades for black politicians that claim to represent blacks:</p>
<p>Barbara Lee, <br>
Representative, Democrat<br>
California, District 9 (Oakland, Berkeley):  Grade F</p>
<p>Diane Watson<br>
Representative, Democrat<br>
California, District 33 (Culver City):  Grade  F</p>
<p>Maxine Waters<br>
Representative, Democrat<br>
California, District 35 (Hawthorne, Inglewood ):  Grade D -</p>
<p>Yeah, black agenda indeed!  Seems like they represent hispanic interests such as keeping the border wide open, no matter the harm to the black community, which means they support black ethnic cleansing and black race replacement by hispanics.</p>
<p>More important to be vigilant against and attack such racist things as electrical wires that might resemble nooses or puerile frat boys who throw ghetto-themed parties while dressed up in black face. </p>
<p>And they call us racists?</p>

		<p>&#8220;A spat has developed among some prominent black leaders about the extent to which President Barack Obama should be pushed to give special attention to African American issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The underlying cause for the lack of black success around the world is a lack of intellectual ability, determination, creativity, and inventiveness, to name but a few of their short comings. No matter how much blacks deny that the burden of success or failure rests STRICTLY with themselves or how much obfuscation they employ pretending they fail because they are victims of some sort, they will not change reality one iota.</p>
<p>I imagine they like to think that SOMEHOW&hellip;.SOMEHOW&hellip;.throwing enough money at their problems and causing a heavy concentration on them will magically result in a group elevation to a higher status in everything.</p>
<p>How childish and naive.  Blacks as a group could do MUCH better if they would employ the necessary effort and discipline to learn subjects up to their abilities and drop their hate filled attitudes and their propensity to always pursue crime for its easy money paydays. But they refuse to make an effort to improve.</p>
<p>No matter if this country were 90% minority, blacks would be making the same excuses for failure as they do now.  </p>

		<p>I think the black agenda has been in effect for fifty years and has produced little following one trillion in monies and untold millions of more qualified people being benched for some quota black.</p>
<p>The black community has severe problems and they are the problem. How can they get their lives in order when they don&rsquo;t have the moral fiber to face the task?  The majority of problem blacks can&rsquo;t even speak English, they are a complete sub-culture.</p>
<p>They need the government teat in all things; even sports where they believe they are so superior.  </p>

		<p>Obama is a politician.  He&rsquo;s far from the best, but he&rsquo;s savvy enough to realize he&rsquo;s got the black vote sewn up.  What he needs is every other ethnicity, and he won&rsquo;t get it pandering heavily to blacks.  Like the gays, they get a sop from time to time, and that&rsquo;s all.<br>
Hopefully, Obama&rsquo;s election has caused white people to wake up.  The greatest cultural danger is from Hispanics, though, not blacks.  The latter has hovered in the 12-13% for decades because of their high rates of disease, murder, and even abortion.  </p>

		<p>Comrade O seems much more a communist than a racist, although he falls nicely into both categories. How ironic the imagined figurehead of the free world, should be utterly in favor of destroying freedom the world over. His friends are our enemies, and vice versa, proven by the fact he disses our country, and those countries who are friendly to us, while crawling in bed with those who hate us most. This country is being run by educated idiots, and their king. </p>
