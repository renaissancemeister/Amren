<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35334421/ns/politics-white_house/">Black Leaders Meet With Obama on Economy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama and three prominent African-American leaders grappled Wednesday with how to improve economic opportunities for blacks, whose joblessness looms well above the national average and is nearly twice that of whites.</p>
<p>On a day of treacherous weather in Washington, Obama kept his scheduled meeting with Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP; Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League; and the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network. Dorothy Height, chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women, could not make it to the White House because of the pounding snow and winds that kept most of the nationís capital shut down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama and the other leaders focused on targeting aid to regions to help black people and other groups that have been hit disproportionately hard by the recession, Jealous told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Jealous] added: &#8220;This is about place. It&rsquo;s not about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama, the nation&rsquo;s first black president, has consistently held that he cannot adopt employment strategies that are designed to solely help blacks. But he supports targeting help to regions most in need, which in turn, he says, would lift the African-American community.</p>
<p>{snip} The unemployment rate for blacks was 16.5 percent in January, compared to 9.7 percent overall and 8.7 percent for whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s clear is that we have a president who gets it,&#8221; Jealous said. He accused Republican lawmakers and governors of obstructing Obama on initiatives like stimulus spending and a push to overhaul health insurance. Those efforts would help minorities, he said.</p>

<p>How ironic, Comrade Jealous, particularly coming from the president of an organization from which everything and anything, is always about &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a 50/50 split here Comrade Jealous; it is about place and race, both. You see Comrade Jealous, it is about a race that is consistently out of place, and has been for over 200 years in the USA.</p>
<p>And I am not talking about the white race&hellip;hint, hint, hint!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;President Barack Obama and three prominent African-American leaders grappled Wednesday with how to improve economic opportunities for blacks, whose joblessness looms well above the national average and is nearly twice that of whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where are the black job comparison figures to Hispanics and Asians?  How about Middle Easterners?  There&rsquo;s 7 million Muslims in this country now.  That surely merits tracking their group as well.</p>
<p>Why are the programmed leftist malcontents always comparing blacks to whites in everything, as if there are no other racial groups in the country?  Hispanics amount to 45 million.  And, what about Asians?  Asians are fewer, but still number in the millions.</p>
<p>These same black leaders think that the solution to black problems are to dumb down all testing so more of them can pass;  award them jobs whether they&rsquo;re qualified or not, then give them about $50,000 each in reparations for slavery.  </p>
<p>In other words black leaders think if blacks were interjected in every aspect of American society, schooling and businesses with the same economic clout as whites, they could just continue on forever to maintain their status and positions.</p>
<p>My question is:  How long does this naive black leadership think blacks will hold on to their money and positions without falling back into the same old rut they were in before, because they can&rsquo;t maintain high enough standards to succeed as equal partners in any civilized society?  I mean, it isn&rsquo;t possible to keep the aforementioned process going forever without causing the country to collapse into a third world scenario from massive incompetence.</p>
<p>Blacks have more than an equal opportunity to succeed, but they can&rsquo;t.  Everything has been discussed to alleviate their failures except examining the truth in order to find a solution.</p>
<p>And this evaluation isn&rsquo;t blatant racism, as the blacks and leftists would call it.  It is stark reality.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Improving job opportunities for blacks?&#8221;  What arrant nonsense - how about &#8220;Improving blacks to make them QUALIFY for job opportunities?&#8221;  Of course, it&rsquo;d be a Herculean task - you gotta improve the ATTITUDE of said blacks, then you have to improve their LITERACY level, then you have to improve their JUDGMENT CAPACITY   &mdash;   maybe it&rsquo;d help to start at the genetic level&hellip;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll finish this statement&hellip; the 16.5% want to be unemployed and collecting a check from The Man, while the 8.7%, well 8.0% of the 8.7%, want to be earning a check!  It&rsquo;s a cultural mindset, period!<br>

<p>Improving economic opportunities for blacks is strictly a black issue.  It is up to them, as it has been for every other race in this country, whether or not they succeed.  Nobody is holding them back.  On the contrary billions have been spent to no avail to get them into the mainstream, but THEY JUST CAN&rsquo;T COMPETE.</p>
<p>Blacks have to quit involving everybody else with their failures and inabilities.</p>
<p>IT IS NOT OUR PROBLEM IT IS THEIR PROBLEM AND ONLY THEIR PROBLEM.</p>
<p>Blaming black failure on anybody or anything but blacks is the biggest lie of the modern era.</p>

		<p>I wonder if immigration was discussed at the meeting. I wonder if outsourcing to foreign countries of manufacturing and service jobs was discussed. I wonder if schools that produce bums and criminals who are useless as workers was discussed.</p>
<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s, when all of these impediments to Black achievment did not exist, Blacks seemed to have little trouble find employment that paid a decent wage.</p>

		<p>How can blacks know anything about business jobs as opposed to government jobs? Where would blacks be without the government since we know it was the government of Republic red party Lincoln who mobilized the worlds largest ever army of 2 million northern American whites to pre-emptively attack their southern neighboring American nation after goading them to fire on Ft Sumter. </p>
<p>Isnt is an awful strange wierd coincidence that the RED Republic party was formed 6 years after the red Marx Manifesto was published for the world to read and GOP tyrant uneducated piece of white trash liar Lincoln was selected 6 years later as the 16th president. </p>
<p>That sure sounds like the mark of the 666 beast.</p>
<p>GOP = 666 original mark of the beast and 666 DNC that has been included later mainly after 1964 or exactly 100 yrs after the original GOP Marx party was formed to make both the same party like Wallace said in 1968.</p>

<p>Economic opportunities for blacks have been greater for blacks than whites for 40 years in an effort to get them off the welfare rolls and keep them from committing so many crimes, but all have been a frustrating effort that has led to failure.</p>
<p>How about having these same &#8220;leaders&#8221; and Obama &#8220;grapple&#8221; with determining how to get blacks to buckle down and study, stop violence and crime, reduce their 70% of fatherless homes, and learn a trade, because it&rsquo;s unrealistic to expect them to compete on a college level.</p>
<p>Lack of &#8220;economic opportunites&#8221; are NOT the problem.  Black tendency toward pathology and an inability to learn on a white level are the problems that should be addressed.</p>

		<p>Sure, the unemployment rate for blacks is terrrible, but after years of working around them when I was in a blue collar trade, I have to say that much of the unemployment is richly deserved.  Who wants to put up with drama, nonsense, poor attendance and poor workmanship day after day?  When blacks if ever earn more of a reputation as being hard-working, like Mexicans, they would&rsquo;nt have so many problems being hired.  Unfortunately, there is often a large degree of truth in stereotypes.</p>

<p>Ideas:</p>
<p>(1)  Stop deluding ourselves with racial equality.  Not everyone is college material.</p>
<p>(2)  The three prominent African-American leaders in question should decouple from the Raza/open borders crowd, and start pushing for immigration restrictions, so that blacks aren&rsquo;t crowded out of the labor market for jobs that they can do.</p>
<p>(3)  Focus blacks on jobs that they can do and do well.  Otherwise, you&rsquo;re giving them inflated expectations and will only make them angry when they inevitably don&rsquo;t come to pass.</p>
<p>(4)  Revitalize the labor union movement, so that those in jobs where organized labor is appropriate can bargain collectively for reasonable wages and benefits in a sane manner.</p>

<p>Blacks have not been moved off the welfare rolls at all.  They have just been moved from low paid welfare to well paid welfare aka affirmative action government jobs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a black woman who gets $1,000 per month on welfare and a free apartment in the projects and a black woman who gets $50,000 a year and a free office in a government building?</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing.</p>

		<p>The way MSNBC puts it: </p>
<p>[Black] joblessness looms well above the national average and is nearly twice that of whites.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;d put it: </p>
<p>Blacks are nearly twice as likely as whites to be either unqualified for jobs and/or twice as likely to prefer receiving welfare over taking jobs for which they are qualified.</p>
<p><br>
Also, when discussing African-American employment strategies, did either President Obama or his three consulting bruthas&rsquo; from NAACP/NUL/Sharpton Inc bring up the possible solution of a revitalized Pullman Porters union? </p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s the logical fallacy with most blacks.  They claim they are a strong race, superior to whites, yet ask them why their race are having problems and ask them why, if they are superior, that another race is holding them back? </p>
