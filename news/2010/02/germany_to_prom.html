<h1>Germany to Promote &#8216;Language of Ideas&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Verena Schmitt-Roschmann, Washington Post, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sprechen Sie Deutsch? Well, you should, at least according to Germany&rsquo;s foreign minister.</p>
<p>Guido Westerwelle drew plenty of sarcastic remarks when he insisted on speaking German to a British reporter just after his election to parliament four months ago. Now, he&rsquo;s making it his official mission to promote his mother tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;German is the language at the heart of Europe,&#8221; Westerwelle said in a somewhat poetic statement Thursday at the outset of his new global campaign for the so-called &#8220;Language of Ideas,&#8221; and he came up with reasons to learn German.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the key to more than 350 German universities and colleges, to Europe&rsquo;s largest economy,&#8221; Westerwelle said. &#8220;It grants access to German literature, music, philosophy, and science, to the wealth of great European cultural traditions and, not least, it is the key to realizing one&rsquo;s own goals and ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new campaign aims to combine and highlight the multitude of existing language teaching and cultural projects  &mdash;  without actually spending more than the euro300 million ($406 million) provided by the government in 2009.</p>
<p>They want to inspire young people worldwide to take up German and &#8220;to motivate decision makers in politics, education, business, and the media within Germany and outside to promote German as a foreign language,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Westerwelle has stressed the beauty of German repeatedly ever since a somewhat notorious press conference in late September, when a BBC reporter asked him if, possibly, the foreign minister to be would answer a question in English.</p>
<p>Westerwelle, who can speak English, rebuffed the request saying: &#8220;Just like it goes without saying that English is spoken in Great Britain it is customary to speak German in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few days later he said only German should be used at official events in Germany as &#8220;the German language is very beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Deutsche Bahn told Hinsken in a letter quoted by German media that the company recognizes the need to cut down on the use of anglicisms.</p>
<p>While most Germans study English in school and often resort to the global language, some foreigners seem to go along with Westerwelle&rsquo;s take on German.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like German. It is amazing, it is so rational and it makes so much sense,&#8221; said Inara Vaz from Sao Paulo, Brazil, who has been studying German in Berlin for a year.</p>

<p>Well, as a German I have to say that German is not easy. Many believe that Westerwelle said that because his English pronunciation is very bad. But Westerwelle is some kind of a new hero in Germany, cause he is saying what most (whites) believe about many things.<br>
He was the one who criticized after just few month in the administration the welfare program in Germany cause many immigrants come here not for work but just for getting welfare and complaining how racist the whites would be. He is saying what lefties want to hide. They called him &#8220;wide right&#8221; he answered &#8220;If some call me wide right it only shows how left our parliament has become&#8221;. Merkel in opposition is the typical worst case politician: Eyes closed, ears closed, mouth closed. Doing nothing just waiting for problems solve themselves. </p>
<p>If Germans FDP in which Westerwelle is gets on the right side, Europe may have a chance: Netherlands are going to vote right, in Italy the right of Berlusconi is ruling and even getting stronger, Austria, Netherlands,France Poland Dänmark Sweden &hellip; now everywhere the rights are getting stronger and stronger because people are seeing the problem, especially the crimes  by Moslem immigrants.</p>

		<p>Until WWI, German was a de facto second language of the United States.  There were mainline newspapers in the &#8220;Kraut Belt&#8221; of Pennsylvania-to-Missouri and parts to the north that were written and published entirely in German, and these weren&rsquo;t explicitly ethnic newspapers, these were the mainstream papers of the town.</p>

		<p>Ja, well, hast du geforst?  I don&rsquo;t have any problem with using German, even though it&rsquo;s been over 30 years since I studied it.  It&rsquo;s a wonderful language, a lot harder than French or Spanish, and I think it&rsquo;s a great idea for people to go back to speaking the official language of their own country.</p>

		<p>Personally, I love the German language. Because English is a Germanic language, it is easier for native English speakers to learn than it is for those whose native language is one of the Romance languages. I speak German, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian. I can figure out Danish and Icelandic because of their similarity to those other Germanic languages. If I went to my local Lowe&rsquo;s and saw all the signs in English and German rather than in English and Spanish, it wouldn&rsquo;t bother me one bit. When I hear those vile, dirty hispanics babbling that gibberish they call Spanish, it makes my blood boil. German is the language of some of the greatest musicians, scientists and other movers and shakers in the history of the world. The German people have contributed a great deal to the United States. </p>
<p>I was once watching one of the network cop shows on television. A German character said something in German, and one detective said to another, &#8220;It sounds so ugly in German.&#8221; to which he responded. &#8220;Everything sounds ugly in German.&#8221;  I wonder what the viewers&rsquo; reaction would have been  if language in question had been Spanish, as spoken by hispanics.  </p>

		<p>As a musician, I find music such as Schubert&rsquo;s Lieder to seem more powerful now that I can understand German fairly well without resorting to reading a translation along with it (except for words I fail to catch).</p>

		<p>It is good to see Germany finally getting up off it&rsquo;s knees before all those who wished to turn it into a mongrel, multicult society after WW II. The vast majority of the German people were not even alive during the world war II era but are still being punished and maligned at every turn for all the troubles in Europe. Germany has given the world many great scientists and some of the most superb musical and operatic minds in history. Germany is a great nation full of great people who deserve to be just what they are, Germans. I lived in Germany for almost 2 years when I was younger and I can truly say that they are some of the most welcoming, hospitable and friendly people that I have ever encountered. If the rest of Europe would be more proud of their languages, nations and cultures they wouldn&rsquo;t have 1/3 of the problems they have today. I say, good for Germany. Don&rsquo;t lose your nation, culture and identity for anyone!!!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting observation of mine. I work on a NATO camp and there are Italian, Spanish and Estonian army troops here. I hear them speak often and the TRUE Spanish sounds a lot like Italian and the troops seem to be able to understand each other in the main. However, there is one notable lack! ONLY ENGLISH AND GERMAN have words for TECHNICAL concepts!! it is odd to hear French, Arabic and many other languages I encounter to be speaking their own language interjected with GERMAN and ENGLISH technical terms because those concepts are generally beyond their speech processes.</p>

		<p>Historically German was the big language on the continent of Europe. It was the language of Germany proper and also most of Switzerland. It was also common in the old Habsburg empire and in Russia too. Much of the old Czarist Russian elite was of German descent and the Baltic and Volga Germans colonized much of Russia. Indeed there were extensive German settlements all across eastern Europe, (in Romania there were the Translyvanian Germans for example). All of this changed after the second world war. By then the old German-Russian nobility had all been wiped out by the Bolsheviks and many millions of Germans were forced out of much of eastern Europe. Most of Poland was land belonging to Germany before 1945. 22% of Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s population was ethnic German. Now almost zero. These actions were probably the greatest act of ethnic cleansing in modern history and resulted in the POST-WAR deaths of several million Germans. It would be nice to see German make a comeback of sorts.</p>

		<p>This is good to hear. What I always found sad when visiting home is how many foreign languages are being spoken, and even German itself has adopted so many English words it&rsquo;s silly. When my grandmother would watch TV she would often ask me &#8216;What does that mean? Is it English?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s aside from when you&rsquo;re out in public and often hear every language other than German. Germany really needs to put its pants back on.</p>

		<p>When I look at my ancestry - english, french, german, swedish etc, I find they are all part of related family of languages.  How beautiful a concept, to study languages from our heritage.  Whites need to wake up and take the &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; angle to benefit ourselves.  </p>
<p>We need a renaissance of reaching back into european cultures because the &#8220;American&#8221; identity is so under fire by the left that it has no hope anymore.  </p>
<p>Celebrate the mother cultures and throw multiculturalism back in the face of the diversity crowd.  I remember as a kid going to german themed celebrations and thinking how great it was, even though my connection to germany was 300 years in the past.  </p>
<p>Since most of us Americans are mutts, we can celebrate many different european cultures and spread the love!  It is the only way we will survive and have a stick to beat the diversity crowd with.</p>
<p>I took my family to a renaissance festival recently in the Bronx.  Mind you I live in a majority black/latino/asian city.  I must tell you, I have not seen so many white people together in one place (thousands) in over 20 years.  There were almost no non-whites at all.  </p>
<p>It felt so alien to me, given that I am usually the only white male everywhere I go in my normal life.  I felt like a kid in a candy shop!  I am going to go back every year.  It gave my kids a chance to see whites in the majority.  Priceless.  (Without my intervention, my kids have already decided that they do not like afrovoodoo culture.  I am so happy.)</p>

		<p>So a German suggests that other Europeans should learn and speak German; what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>German is the first language of about 150,000,000 people or thereabouts in central Europe, and is spoken as a second language by many more. It is a language with a noble literature, including works of enduring mathematical, scientific and philosophical importance.</p>
<p>I was interested by &#8220;Grumpy Gringo&#8220;&#8216;s remark that German is &#8220;a lot harder than French or Spanish&#8221;. This hasn&rsquo;t been my personal experience. I spent five years studying French at school and passed an examination in it, but - even though I travel frequently to France - I have never become really fluent in it. I only learnt German as an adult, and within four or five months I was reasonably fluent in it. (I can also manage a rather meagre Espagnol Turistico!)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the grammar of the German language is - on the whole - more complex than that of French and Spanish (although its Germanic verb system is far closer to that of English, and therefore much easier). But the basic wordstock of German is so close to English that there is a sense of familiarity straight away. An English-speaking person, even one who has not studied German, will immediately understand an utterance such as &#8220;Mein Vater ist ein guter Mann&#8221; or &#8220;Der Winter ist kalt&#8221;, and will certainly be able to deduce the meaning of written sentences such as &#8220;Der Schnee ist weiss&#8221; or &#8220;Das Gras ist gruen&#8221;. Try their French and Spanish equivalents on English-speakers who have not studied those languages.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that all European children (of normal intelligence) should compulsorily study English, German, French, Spanish and Italian (as well as classical Latin and Ancient Greek) from the earliest possible age.</p>

<p>I heartily agree with Johnny. And I would add Russian to the list. But for Americans, I would reduce the list somewhat, as they don&rsquo;t get so much opportunity to practice as in Europe.</p>
<p>But I must take issue with Eva B&rsquo;s deplorable comment: <i>&#8220;When I hear those vile, dirty hispanics babbling that gibberish they call Spanish, it makes my blood boil.&#8221; </i> Let me point out that Spanish is one of the great European languages, fully on a par with any other. I haven&rsquo;t a drop of Spanish blood in my veins, btw, therefore no personal bias, but it makes MY own blood boil when I come across ignorant comments like that. She is confusing the &#8220;gibberish&#8221; of illiterate mestizos and mulattos with real Castilian, a noble European tongue, descended from Latin and Visigothic (with many German words in it). That false assumption is just as foolish as  mistaking Jamaicans for Englishmen and callng English &#8220;gibberish&#8221; because of them!</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s room for all kinds of diversity in this world&hellip; I&rsquo;d be hard to imagine any virtue to a world of sameness. I don&rsquo;t know much about the German language but I think its cool and strong. I wish I weren&rsquo;t so lazy in learning Latin but its hard to find an environment where it is spoken, and pronunciation is essential. Fear is one of the most stupid things I&rsquo;ve ever heard of and I think its responsible for trying to erase the Identity&rsquo;s of some of the more virile personalities on this globe. Beauty is impossible without Form and life is unbearable without beauty. If people were confident in their own identities, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so obsessed in undermining the identities of others. If you take the teeth out of reality it it becomes a holocaust against Beauty&hellip;this is a cruelty insufferable* Vive Germania* Vive Diversita* </p>

		<p>I studied German in high school and picked it up again when my son decided to take in 8th grade (Vielen Dank, mein Gott!) I never appreciated the complexity under independent study.  Even though I&rsquo;m half Italian (other half German/English) I never had a desire to study it or other Romance languages.  Not until I met a friend from Colombia.  The Colombians speak Spanish so clearly that I understand the comment about &#8220;gibberish&#8221;.  My friend could just barely understand &#8220;less European&#8221; Central and South American people.  I began to study Spanish and it is a wonderful language.  Both Portuguese (not Brazilian Port.) and Spanish have Germanic influence (Portuguese more so) that is noticable to someone who knows German.  Embrace European diversity.

I took &#8220;gibberish they call Spanish&#8221; to mean that she did not believe that the largely poor, uneducated Hispanics in US actually speak Spanish. She wasn&rsquo;t insulting Spanish as spoken in Spain, but a variety of poor-grammar, poor-pronunciation &#8220;Spanish&#8221; as typically spoken by immigrants here.</p>

		<p>I agree with Johnny English that all European children should learn those languages. I also think that there could be more focus placed on foreign language in the States. I speak German and some French. However, growing up in ths States I didn&rsquo;t get much of an opportunity to really start with languages until I was in college. In Europe, kids study at least one foreign language starting in elementary school and going all the way through to the end of high school.  </p>

		<p>I too love German (especially music); but trying to make it into a desirable international language may be an element leading to the de-Germanification of Germany.  English being the world&rsquo;s lingua franca at present makes it much more difficult to keep foreigners out of the Anglosphere.  Making German an international language will result in an increase in the amount of non-Germans in Germany.  I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s what we want&hellip;.<br>
Anyway, for our Anglophiles out there, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;English literature is still the most important in the world..followed by French&hellip;.German being perhaps a distant third.</p>

&#8220;GHW, I think you are reading Eva&rsquo;s comment incorrectly. I took &ldquo;gibberish they call Spanish&rdquo; to mean that she did not believe that the largely poor, uneducated Hispanics in US actually speak Spanish. She wasn&rsquo;t insulting Spanish as spoken in Spain, but a variety of poor-grammar, poor-pronunciation &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; as typically spoken by immigrants here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signor Verdi,<br>
I agree with you completely. Uneducated Caribbeans speak a &#8220;patois&#8221; that is even hard for other Spanish speakers to get.<br>
It&rsquo;s definitely a question of education.</p>
<p>By the way, con tutto rispetto, I prefer Puccini&rsquo;s music to yours. He definitely has the better tunes.<br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps.  I see it can be read two ways. I hope so. Thanks. </p>
<p>But one often sees unwaranted criticism of Spanish and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; on this site, which really gets under my skin.  Especially so when some people refer to the Spanish as somehing other than white. A very common assumption among many people  (not only Amreners)!  Spain is one of the great European nations, and so are its  culture and language. </p>
<p>To be fair, though, one cannot expect uneducated peons from Guatemala and such to speak refined, literary Spanish, any more than similar Americans speak Oxford English. They are doing their best with what is to them essentially a foreign language.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;educated&#8221; or uneducated Caribbeans, they can be quite nationalistic and defiant about their dialect. I have known &#8220;educated&#8221; Puerto Ricans who bristle at criticism from other Spanish-speakers, maintaining, more or less, that   &mdash;   &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like it, too bad; this is the way we speak and we like it&hellip; so THERE!&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and I agree with you about Puccini too. It doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that!  And also with Anonymous#22 who said it well.</p>

<p>«&hellip;ONLY ENGLISH AND GERMAN have words for TECHNICAL concepts!! it is odd to hear French, Arabic and many other languages I encounter to be speaking their own language interjected with GERMAN and ENGLISH technical terms because those concepts are generally beyond their speech processes.»</p>
<p>Are you a linguist, Skip?</p>
<p>I speak French, and yes, we do have technical terms. </p>
<p>Scientific and technical terms in the English and German languages usually are derived from greek and latin words. Same thing in French.</p>
<p>It is true, however, that there exists a tendancy to use English terms, in many fields. We call those words, anglicisms.</p>
<p>I assure you, such concepts are not beyond our speech processes.</p>

The &#8220;Muhlenberg Legend&#8221;:</p>
<p>Frederick Muhlenberg, son of an immigrant from Germany, became a minister and politician in Pennsylvania;  he is considered the founder of the Lutheran Church in America.  His brother, Peter, was a General in the Continental Army. </p>
<p>Muhlenberg was a member of the Continental Congress and served in the Pennsylvania House of Reps. from 1780 to 1783.  He was president of the Pennsylvania state constitutional convention in 1787 called to ratify the Federal Constitution. He was the first signer of the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>He served in the  first four  US Congresses (March 4, 1789–March 4, 1797). Muhlenberg was the also the first Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.</p>
<p>According to an <i>urban legend,</i> Muhlenberg as House Speaker prevented German from becoming &#8220;an&#8221;  [not the] official language of the United States.  In 1794, during Muhlenberg&rsquo;s second tenure as Speaker, the House voted  against a proposal to translate some laws into German.  Muhlenberg abstained from the vote, commenting, &#8220;The faster the Germans become Americans, the better it will be.&#8221; </p>
<p>Despite not having voted for the bill, a legend called the &#8220;Muhlenberg Legend&#8221; developed in which he was responsible for prohibiting German as an official language of the United States.</p>

		<p>As I read these comments I am disturbed by the lack of unity. Stop bickering about which European language has the most technical terms,or least etc. and UNITE to preserve our origins. Let this trend to include European languages as a uniting factor and appreciate what each European culture has to offer. IT IS ALL GOOD! UNITE! BE PROUD OF YOUR EUROPEAN HERITAGE! What one doesn&rsquo;t know, the other one does. Unite! That&rsquo;s how the world can get things done. Embrace your European culture and be proud of it; embrace all European culture. It is civilization itself!</p>

«Well, as a German I have to say that German is not easy.»<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>German is actually easier (than most) for English-speakers because the two languages are so closely related and have basically similar structures and often have virtually the same vocabularies (with very slight spelling variations), such as father=Vater, brother=Bruder, water=Wasser, weather=Wetter, storm=Sturm, cow=Kuh, man=Mann, boat=Boot, shoe=Schuh&hellip;. etc., etc.  </p>
<p>In fact, If you know English, you already know a lot of German!<br>
Indeed, if you speak English, you&rsquo;re speaking [what is technically]  a dialect of Low German.</p>
<p>(&#8220;Low&#8221;, btw, refers to the lowlands along the North Sea coast and North Germany, as opposed to the highlands of the South.  It does not refer in any way to quality or refinement.)</p>
