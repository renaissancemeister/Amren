<h1>Gang Arrests Stir Tacoma&rsquo;s Hilltop</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cole Cosgrove, News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington), February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Tacoma&rsquo;s Hilltop, residents and business owners had strong reactions Thursday to this week&rsquo;s charges against 32 suspected members of the gang.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In interviews with 20 people along Martin Luther King Jr. Way, some wondered why, if the men were dangerous, police waited so long to arrest them. Others wondered why a black gang was targeted, when white, Mexican and American Indian gangs were not. Some wanted to see the legal process play out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others questioned the conspiracy charges, which are being used for the first time in Washington in an attempt to prosecute gang violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As he walked down MLK Way, Niko Satiacum, 23, said he was nervous  &mdash;  not about gang members, but police.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police could probably roll up on me, just because I&rsquo;m hanging out with certain people,&#8221; said Satiacum, who recently served eight months in jail; he didn&rsquo;t offer specifics about why. &#8220;Say I see someone I went to school with, go up and say hi, and they had done something wrong. The police could turn around and arrest me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his grandfather, Robert Satiacum, was a Puyallup tribal leader.</p>

		<p>Why did it take so long?  The cops needed to gather evidence that would hold up in court.  Mr. Satiacum need not worry   &mdash;   he can&rsquo;t be arrested just for innocently talking to people.  In fact, he can be &#8220;in&#8221; with a gang pretty deep and not commit a crime just for that.  Missouri tried these kinds of laws, and before they could be knocked down as unconstitutionally vague, the General Assembly repealed them because they were useless.  The reason is that &#8220;gang&#8221; in the black community is very relative, there is a huge gray area between being in a gang and not in a gang.</p>

<p>White gangs do not exist in any appreciable numbers.  Just a few skinhead freaks.</p>
<p>By referring to white gangs blacks hope to create the impression all reaces have a gang problem.</p>
<p>Personally, if it were left up to me, I&rsquo;d release these gangbangers to the complainers&rsquo; neighborhoods with my apologies for arresting them.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco,there has been a court order to prohibit gang members (black) from congregating around certain streets in the Hunters point area. The majority of residents(mostly black) in the immediate area support the injunction. </p>

		<p>We have a bit of a problem with Russian/Ukrainian mafia wannabes, and to a lesser extent skinhead/neo-Nazi types. One of these Eastern European idiots was shot by a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy not long ago. But these 2 groups are less of a problem than the Hilltop Crips and other mostly black gangs. Asian gangs have been targeted before (not to as much fanfare as they are not as old or well-known)and will be in the future; same with Latino gangs.<br>
In my opinion (most folks here don&rsquo;t want to hear this because it conflicts with their prejudices), many- maybe even most -black folks have no use for the Hilltop Crips and their ilk. There is FAR too much sympathy and excuse-making for thugs in the black community, but it is not universal by any means. Unfortunately those who sympathize and make excuses are usually the loudest voices and shout down others as disloyal to their race (which is precisely the opposite of the truth).</p>

		<p>There are no white gang members to arrest.  The previous poster had it exactly right.  They are trying to create the impression that the gang problem is equally distributed in all races, when it is clearly not.    </p>
<p>Voluntary segregation seems to be the only viable answer.  The law should respect, allow and even facilitate those that wish to self-segregate.  If people were allowed to freely associate, hire, and live within a racial community, these racial problems would diminish. </p>
<p>Black activists and liberals force these conflicts by forcing integration at every level.  The result is conflict, stress, and an undermining of law and order.</p>
<p>We need political leadership that seriously faces reality and boldly addresses these issues.  The Democrats play to black activists and minorities, and the Republicans naively try to avoid the issue.  The result is destruction of more white neighborhoods.</p>

		<p> A typical mainstream media story about a police crackdown on crime. The reporter goes into the (black) neighborhood where the gang was based, questions people of questionable reputation who predictably come up with &#8220;they wonder why&#8221; questions suggesting racial bias in planning and staging the raid; and highlight comments to the effect, &#8220;it won&rsquo;t do any good, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p> Why didn&rsquo;t the reporter go around Tacoma and get comments from a random, &#8220;diverse&#8221; sampling of the city&rsquo;s residents about the arrests? Was the newspaper afraid of comments that might conflict with the White liberal mindset on race? </p>

<p>What makes you think &#8220;most folks here don&rsquo;t want to hear this because it conflicts with their prejudices?&#8221;  You must have us confused with someone else.  Most blacks just want to be able to make the best living they can and live the best life they can for it, and not be a hindrance toward anyone else.  That the percentage of blacks that either (1) make problems, or (2) engage in apologetics for (1) is far from a majority might be true, but a pig in a poke   &mdash;   it doesn&rsquo;t need to be too big to cause a lot of problems for the rest.  One bad apple might not spoil the bunch, but ten percent will.</p>

		<p>The Turks used to send their thugs and prisoners to fight their wars throughout the Ottoman empire. They were often sent these as shock troopers (in front of the regular soldiers). They were expected to die fighting and thus imposing as much damage on enemy troops as possible. If they were to escape or run back, they were simply shot.<br>
I suggest something of the same with our non-White prison population and our gang members. Send them to Iraq and Afghanistan to be used the Turkish way. It&rsquo;s a win-win for both the military and the American people. But our liberal society is too foolish and soft to allow such brilliant plans to work. <br>

With blacks, it&rsquo;s always a no win situation.</p>
<p>They complain about the crime in their neighborhoods and that the police don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>When the police show up, they scream &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see a white or black chief of police go off and rant about the statement I wrote above. Too many chief of police either don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on (and I can believe that because police requirements have been dumbed down) or they know it to be true won&rsquo;t say it out loud.<br>

		<p>Blacks also want to paint whites as gang members so they can accuse of us doing racial attacks and, as another poster said, to say, &#8220;Well, whites do bad things, too.&#8221;  Sorry, but the rare child molestors aren&rsquo;t the majority of whites and most whites abhor and shun child molestors.  We don&rsquo;t make martyrs out of white criminals.  We don&rsquo;t say, &#8220;It&rsquo;s not your fault, my white brother.  You&rsquo;re just a victim of the system.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#5 is right about the idea of voluntary segregation.  If white communities could keep troublesome minorities off their streets and out of their stores, theaters, etc., much of white-targeted crime would be eliminated.  As it is now, people who misbehave in public places can be expelled, but too many business owners don&rsquo;t understand the law or are fearful of the very accusation of racism.  Laws should change so that outright racial segregation is legal in privately owned institutions.  Probably, most businesses would not exclude any group, since green is the color at issue.  But such a law would give any business or community the opportunity to exclude groups with which it is having problems.  </p>

		<p>This story reminds me of a discussion between George S. Patton and a Polish general right after WW II.</p>
<p>Patton asked the Polish officer whether he&rsquo;d rather fight the Russians or the Germans.</p>
<p>His Polish counterpart, without hesitation, replied, &#8220;The Germans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; asked Patton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business before pleasure,&#8221; said the Pole.</p>

		<p>As some have commented on the paucity of white &#8220;gangs,&#8221; around where I live, it seems the only &#8220;whites&#8221; who are in gangs or causing trouble are eastern europeans (and some southern italians).  </p>
<p>I find it comical that someone with a polish or albanian last name is walking around flashing neo-nazi symbols.  Don&rsquo;t any of these people know that naziism is the philosophy that germanic people are the best (and not all whites in general)?  </p>
<p>How can a Slovakian man or a Serb walk around saluting pictures of hitler when they are not of hitler&rsquo;s ethnic group.  I think some of these white &#8220;gangs&#8221; have an identity crisis being immigrants in a formerly white land and finding that whites are a hunted and receding group.  </p>
<p>It would be like if a bunch of Hungarians immigrated to Zimbabwe to seek their fortune.  Blacks would be everywhere and they would see no progress.  </p>
<p>The eastern europeans came to America, though, thinking that the people looked like them, and then - boom - they find out that they&rsquo;ve come to a Zimbabwe in the making.  They reach out for any symbols of white resistence and fall into the neo-nazi thing.  Weird, isn&rsquo;t it?  Too bad these skinhead whackos embarass us and give non-whites a stick to beat us with.</p>

<p>First of all, as has already been noted, there are no white gangs, except for a few skinhead freaks and phony wannabes.</p>
<p>Second of all, Hispanic gangs are not nearly as vexatious to decent average citizens as black gangs, since they tend to prefer organized crimes like trafficking in contraband to street crimes like robbery, rape and murder of innocents (they will still happily gun down members of rival gangs, though. Not really a bad thing when you think about it.) As an aside, this is probably a function of their higher I.Q.s and better impulse control.</p>
<p>As far as Indian gangs are concerned, I don&rsquo;t have enough experience with them to comment, but I would wager that they fall into one of the above categories. They either don&rsquo;t cause much trouble for the average Joe or are a bunch of phony wannabes. </p>

<p><br>
Ever heard of the Mafia or the famous Irish gangs of Boston? I guess the &#8220;Gangs of New York&#8221; was pure fiction.</p>
<p>Frank &amp; Jesse james &#8220;hole in the wall gang&#8221;, was an invention of P.C revisionist movie directors &amp; writers. Yes we&rsquo;ve noticed the glaring hypocrisy of Hollywood, whites get movies showing the mafia as heros with honor(Bugsy,Hoffa &#8220;Mayer Lansky&#8221;) but black ppl are told the complete opposite that gangs are no good cannot defend you from white injustice, You must NEVER see them as an any sort of afro Haganah etc.<br>
