<h1>Racism or an Honest Mistake?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fred Childers, KSLA-TV (Shreveport), February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She [Ebony Ross, a junior at C.E. Byrd High School] says she was so offended that she cried when she saw it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was shocked, and I was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why would this happen and it&rsquo;s black history month,&#8221; said Ross.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the schools position, that while the placement of this rope appears suspect, and even unfortunate, it is not a hangman&rsquo;s noose, and there&rsquo;s no hate crime.</p>
<p>Head of Caddo school security, Roy Murry says &#8220;The drama club was using the rope to secure lights to the balcony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ebony says the principal had it removed, but blew off her concerns it might have been a noose and, with it, a symbolic threat against blacks in the school.</p>
<p>When asked if the principal didn&rsquo;t see what she saw because he&rsquo;s white, Ross said yes.</p>

		<p>No real threat is needed. The &#8220;offended&#8221; person just has to belong to a non-Caucasian race, and the &#8220;offended&#8221; person can get people fired, put in jail, and collect big bucks.</p>

		<p>So, a teenage black girl is offended by seeing a rope in the month of February, eh? </p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m offended by the unrelenting racial hysteria of blacks; by the openly hostile portrayal of whites in every area of popular culture; by racist policies in every level of government, academia, and business; and by the incessant pandering to blacks and elevation of blacks everywhere I turn. I&rsquo;m all the more offended by the fact that the near worship of blacks is almost invariably accompanied by sanctimonious pronouncements about this being a &#8220;post-racial&#8221; society. </p>
<p>I shed no tears for Ebony Ross! </p>

		<p>Just more whining from lifelong &#8220;victims&#8221; of &#8220;perceived&#8221; or &#8220;subliminal&#8221; racism where there is a boogyman behind every corner. The rope used to secure heavy stage lights had a loop in it and therefore looked like a &#8220;noose&#8221;, so now someone who hasn&rsquo;t a clue is offended by a &#8220;rope&#8221; has to make an issue and the spineless whites in this scenario will capitulate and call for more &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; training when tying knots used in securing those lights. <br>

		<p>Little Ebony was not around when there was REAL discrimination, so she doesn&rsquo;t know a noose from a simple rope used by stagehands.  Believe me, if she had been around in the &#8216;50&rsquo;s and &#8216;60&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;d be VERY clear on the difference, and wouldn&rsquo;t go around parading her ignorance before the world as she so whiningly did in this instance.  Such stupidity is hard to excuse.</p>

		<p>Remarkable how the mere sight of a rope sends blacks into paroxysms of terror.  I imagine the poor girl had to be sedated.</p>
<p>Truly, I&rsquo;m getting thoroughly sick of these ridiculous people enjoying a privileged status they hardly deserve.  They need only to claim offense over something, anything, and white apologists grovel before them abjectly begging for forgiveness.  It&rsquo;s a truly revolting spectacle, otherwise good people prostrating themselves before a group which comprises the criminal class of America, which in fact has precious few achievements (barring athletic) to its credit, which wherever they&rsquo;re found throughout the world finds itself at the bottom of the social, economic, and productive ladder.  And it&rsquo;s always someone else&rsquo;s fault, always, everywhere, every time.</p>
<p>How long are we going to put up with this?</p>

AR has reported on this issue before.</p>
<p>There are many knots used in theatrical rigging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what knot was used here but this figure of eight knot could appear to some over-sensitive and ignorant people as a noose:</p>

<p>Nice try there.  Some lawyers and a judge will declare elsewise.  I foretell a creation of a Black Studies unit, along with 5 or 6 $100k/year jobs to go along with it.  How long is it before Vegaas starts making book on these things?</p>

		<p>I have a child which attends this school, and I can tell you this story is pure hype. Either the girl in question is lying and was put up to this, or she has been so brainwashed that she &#8220;sees&#8221; things which are not there.  I also know the principle and he is the most PC cretin you&rsquo;d ever want to know and would NEVER do anything which would &#8220;diss&#8221; a black at this school.  This High School falls all over itself to appease blacks and makes sure they are nearly pampered. So, don&rsquo;t believe anything you hear to the contrary.</p>

		<p>Not as though I would ever invite Ebony Ross aboard my sailing boat but she would freak out at the mere sight of all the ropes, lines, stays, painters, halyards and other rigging. Even the names of some of the knots would make her hair curl!! Perhaps the chain locker would revive her in-built racial memory of her ancestors being transported as slaves and she would definitely be offended by a rope ladder, tar brush or a shackle. Of course, crossing the equator and being &#8216;blacked-up&rsquo; for the ceremony would be totally out of the question. What on earth do these africans learn at school when they spend so much time bitching and moaning about such stupid trivial nonsense? I bet she knows all about welfare. </p>

		<p>To answer the question in the headline: &#8220;Racism, or honest mistake?&#8221;</p>
<p>RACISM! It is definitely racism on the part of little Ebony, who hates white people and is trying to scam them out of some reparations. It&rsquo;s not an honest mistake, she knows it&rsquo;s just a rope and not a hangman&rsquo;s noose.</p>
<p>As for the drama club, which placed the rope: it is neither racism nor a mistake. It&rsquo;s a standard piece of theatrical rigging, you can find one like it in any theater in the country. <br>

		<p>I still say that &#8216;Offending&rsquo; is now a capitol crime. There is 1st, 2nd and 3rd Degree Offending, Malice Offending, Offending with the Intent to Distribute, Attempted Offending&hellip; and the list goes on.  This child was obviously well educated at home about how to cry racism. </p>

		<p>This reminds of the idle practice of finding shapes in clouds. Don&rsquo;t blacks realize that plenty of white people have been hanged throughout history, often by other whites?

A lot of this (black) racial-hysteria nonsense would fade away of its own accord if the (white) media stopped indulging it. There is absolutely no reason why this latest ridiculous accusation of noose-mongering should be reported by newspapers and TV stations. </p>
<p>When one of these hypersensitive dimwits tries to play the ghetto lottery like this by getting on TV, the TV stations should be in the habit of telling them, &#8220;Sorry, but without any verification, that&rsquo;s not news, so no we&rsquo;re not sending out the camera crew to film you shreiking and crying over imaginary insults.&#8221; </p>
<p>After being rebuffed like that a few times in a row, their eagerness to call the media will dwindle considerably. And then we might finally be rid of annoying &#8220;news&#8221; items like this. </p>
