			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Muslim bus driver stunned passengers by pulling over mid-route and beginning to pray in the aisle.</p>
<p>The driver stopped the bus without warning before removing his shoes and, using a fluorescent jacket as a prayer mat, beginning to chant in Arabic.</p>
<p>Passengers said they feared the driver could be preparing for a terror attack.</p>
<p>No one was able to get on or off the vehicle during the five-minute prayer session.</p>
<p>Passenger Gayle Griffiths complained to Transport for London about the bizarre incident on the No.24 bus in Gospel Oak, north London, this week.</p>
<p>Mother-of-one Miss Griffiths, 33, of Camden, north-west London, had boarded the bus a few minutes earlier on her way home from work.</p>
<p>She says that she even feared at the time that the driver might be a fanatic planning to blow up the bus.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I have done the journey a million times before but I was in a hurry to get home to pick my little girl up from school.</p>
<p>&#8216;We had just picked up and let off people at a bus stop and moved off again when the driver stopped the bus very suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8216;He got out of his cab, leaving the engine running, and walked towards the middle exit door.</p>
<p>&#8216;He laid out a fluorescent jacket on the floor and I thought that somebody must have been sick and he was covering it up.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t really think much of it.</p>
<p>&#8216;But then he took off his shoes and began praying. I was gobsmacked and quite bewildered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Griffiths said the bus driver didn&rsquo;t give the passengers any explanation as to what he was doing.</p>
<p>&#8216;He hadn&rsquo;t addressed the passengers at all,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;I didn&rsquo;t say anything and nor did anyone else. I thought it would all be over in 30 seconds but it went on for over five minutes.</p>
<p>&#8216;It even went through my mind that this might be some sort of terrorist attack with the bus blown up because I had heard that suicide bombers prayed before attacks.</p>
<p>&#8216;As the engine was running anyone could also have got in the cab and driven off with a bus full of passengers.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was also blocking the exit, so if something had happened we would not have been able to get off.</p>
<p>&#8216;Everyone was looking round in a mix of shock and amazement. It was truly bizarre, ludicrous and aggravating.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are delayed often enough as it is in London.</p>
<p>&#8216;We live in a multi-cultural society but there is a time and a place for prayer and the middle of a journey with a busload of passengers is not it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Transport for London said it had apologised to all the passengers for the delay to their journey and said all Muslim drivers are being reminded that they should pray during statutory rest periods rather than hold up services.</p>
<p>A TfL spokesman said: &#8216;A route 24 bus was delayed following a decision by the driver to stop the bus to pray.</p>
<p>&#8216;The bus company, London General, has had a word with the driver as this is not something that should be happening.</p>
<p>&#8216;TfL apologises to passengers for any inconvenience this may have caused them. </p>
<p>&#8216;We understand that there is some flexibility in the Muslim faith as to the times of day that drivers can pray.</p>
<p>&#8216;TfL and the individual bus operating companies acknowledge and value the diversity of their staff. </p>
<p>&#8216;As diverse employers, TfL and the bus operators provide suitable prayer or quiet rooms at garages and other key locations for staff who wish to practise their faith.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have asked London General to remind drivers who have a requirement to pray to use these facilities during their rest periods.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>I think that the driver should be fired. There is no reason to stop what you were doing and start praying, especially when special facilities (which are not provided for other religions I would probably assume) are provided for your convienence. If I were an employee of the bus company I would demand a prayer chapel for any Christian employees as well as Synagogue for any Jews and a quiet room for any agnostics/atheists. I think that covers everybody! When I was denied my request I would complain that it was not fair that the Muslims had their own room and nobody else did. Plus I would reiterate that I thought that employees were there to drive buses, not pray. The UK is dead! </p>

		<p>I trumped a lady at the fried chicken hut once who didn`t want to wait on me as she was &#8220;on break.&#8221; All it took was vaulting the counter and beginning to serve myself. Someone should have made the same play here. How long would he have been on the ground once his bus began to roll?&hellip;</p>

Because of the previous London bus bombing, this guy should be terminated for throwing a scare into the passengers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really shocking here is that people are talking about this as if it&rsquo;s nothing more than a cultural misunderstanding. This is how far we&rsquo;ve come. What should be seen as potential threat is treated as nothing more than foolish inconvenience.<br>

		<p>Rather than complain about this sort of thing, those on our side should embrace it  &mdash;   as a tactic.  We should immediately concede that this man&rsquo;s religion demands that he  &mdash;   and all his brethren  &mdash;   do this.</p>
<p>We have no right to tell this man how to live his life.  We only have the right to tell him <i>where</i> to live it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s excercise that right!<br>

		<p>Authorities should have fired the unnamed Muslim bus driver at once &mdash; without apology. </p>

<p>That sounds like the method a particularly indulgent parent would take with a 5-year-old child. And it doesn&rsquo;t work. </p>

<p>Ahem, I&rsquo;ll bet that idiot&rsquo;s salary there are not, have never been-and especially never will be- any &#8220;prayer or quiet&#8221; rooms for Christians to pray.<br>
But then, Christians, as a group are not slaves to a totalitarian &#8220;religion&#8221; that means &#8220;submission.&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW, why didn&rsquo;t the brits take this Hadji and grab him by his dress, and toss his raggedy butt of the bus?<br>
Really lets you know where the cajones of Brits went, some time ago!</p>

		<p>About a year ago I was walking across the car park on my way into Asda (Walmart)& I saw a muslim man flatten a cardboard box, kneel on it and start to pray. I thought then that there is a time and place for everything.</p>

		<p>Of course he should be dismissed. His passenger carrying licence should be revoked as everything he did is totally against all bus driving licence rules in UK. He was probably put up to do this to establish a precedent for muslims but it won&rsquo;t work. He will be required to surrender his driving licence for endorsement as his private car licence is on the same document but can be retained once the DVLA has removed the bus driving section. His employer must haul him in for a recorded interview and this dangerous behaviour noted on his file as the insurance company won&rsquo;t tolerate it. Any affected passenger can lodge a formal complaint with the bus company who will need such evidence to back-up his dismissal hearing.</p>

		<p>Muslims are irredeemable backwards desert psychotics frozen forever in the 14th century who are utterly incapable of adapting to the concept of independent thought, free expression and the modern world.  </p>
<p>They must be deported from all Western nations and sent back to their ancestral homelands and forced to remain there forever&hellip; </p>
