			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A racism row has broken out after a city&rsquo;s taxi drivers started displaying stickers in their cars saying they are &#8216;English speaking&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Up to a dozen drivers have been showing off the notices bearing the St George&rsquo;s Cross on the back windows of their cars in Southampton, Hampshire.</p>
<p>The small red and white sticker declares the cab is being driven by an &#8216;English speaking driver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the flags have been branded &#8216;racist&rsquo; by trade representatives, councillors and racism campaigners who have demanded they are removed.</p>
<p>Taxi drivers have hit back, claiming the stickers are simply a protest to force the council to make sure new drivers can speak good English.</p>
<p>The stickers were placed in the cars after drivers received complaints about the standard of spoken English among them.</p>
<p>There have also been complaints from passengers about drivers using sat navs and over-charging.</p>
<p>Perry McMillan, chairman of the Southampton cab section of trade union Unite, said the group&rsquo;s ethnic minority members had been upset by the stickers.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Surely all drivers speak English. If they don&rsquo;t, then what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>&#8216;We hope that licensing officers can investigate this and satisfy the trade that this isn&rsquo;t the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Campaign group Show Racism the Red Card demanded the stickers be taken down from the cab windows.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Ged Grebby said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t have a problem with displaying the cross of St George because this is a symbol we have managed to reclaim from the far right.</p>
<p>&#8216;But the &#8220;English speaking driver&#8221; part is where it crosses the line into racism.</p>
<p>&#8216;Cab drivers have to have a command of English and there are strong racist undertones in this message.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think the drivers should take the flags down immediately and if they don&rsquo;t, they should be told to by the council who licences them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But taxi drivers have hit back at the allegations of racism.</p>
<p>Clive Johnson, chairman of taxi firm Radio Taxis and the Southampton Trade Association, said: &#8216;These signs are not racial.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are a protest to the council saying please make sure all new drivers have command of the English language.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are a few drivers out there who cannot speak English and just bluff their way along.</p>
<p>&#8216;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are Polish, Russian, French or Spanish, if they can&rsquo;t communicate with passengers then it&rsquo;s a problem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taxi driver Peter Ford, 48, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s just about letting customers know that the driver will actually be able to speak English, which isn&rsquo;t always the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fellow driver Chris Head, 49, added: &#8216;I have no problem with the stickers.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lots of customers will wait at ranks until an English driver comes along because they want someone they can talk to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ian Hall, chairman of the Southampton Hackney Association, said half of the group&rsquo;s 126 members are from an Asian background.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t think any drivers should have these stickers in the back of their car because it&rsquo;s racist.</p>
<p>&#8216;If drivers have got these stickers in their back windows then they need to take them down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Hall said night trade in Southampton would &#8216;collapse&rsquo; without ethnic minority drivers, who buy the majority of taxi plates.</p>
<p>The sticker issue was raised at a meeting between cab firms and Southampton City Council.</p>
<p>It is believed that the council would order them to be removed if it received complaints from passengers.</p>
<p>Chairman of the council&rsquo;s licensing committee Councillor Brian Parnell said the stickers were &#8216;offensive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s certainly not the image we want for Southampton.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is offensive to drivers from ethnic minorities who form a large part of the city&rsquo;s drivers and without whom Southampton&rsquo;s taxi service would suffer.</p>
<p>&#8216;We want to promote harmony in the city.</p>
<p>&#8216;But it is important that taxi drivers meet a certain set of standards and one of those is the ability to speak English.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is normal good practice for anyone working in another country to be able to speak the language of that country.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think the problem might be that many drivers do speak English but with a heavy accent that can be difficult to understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cllr Don Thomas, who sits on the licensing committee, added: &#8216;Taxis and taxi drivers can form the first impression that visitors have of Southampton.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think this is completely the wrong sort of message to be sending out in what is proudly a cosmopolitan city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A council spokesman said: &#8216;People should contact the council and let us know if they see signs and stickers being used in taxis, particularly if they find them offensive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Currently, anyone who wants to drive a taxi must hold a British driving licence, pass a medical, undergo a criminal record check and complete a &#8216;knowledge&rsquo; test of Southampton.</p>
<p>Last year council chiefs added a driving assessment and a test in basic reading, writing and communication skills.</p>
<p>Within six months of taking to the road, drivers must also pass a BTec qualification in Road Transport Passenger Driving.<br>

		<p>Announcing the ability to speak English in English-speaking England is racist?  Did anyone point out that an English-speaking Pakistani cabbie could also put an &#8220;I Speak English&#8221; sign in his window (as long as it is true).  Is it racist for a shop keeper to put &#8220;Chinese spoken here&#8221; or &#8220;Polish spoken here&#8221;?  You are just letting potential customers know what you offer, other than just 4 wheels.  A tourist might have some questions other than &#8220;how much to the Palace&#8221;.  And they might wish to speak with a driver who can answer in an understandable fashion.  Can you imagine the poor Japanese tourist, who&rsquo;s English may be somewhat limited, trying to get information out of a cabbie who barely speaks English?  Is it fair to the tourist?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, what would we do without those saintly minorities?  Oh, locals would do the job?  They apparently never thought of that.  And I wonder why &#8220;they&#8221; buy so many so many taxi plates?  Is it because they are so unemployable that all they can do is rip someone off in taxi rides from hell?</p>

		<p>People of all races speak English.  There are people of all races who cannot speak English. How illogical is it to maintain that racism is language-based?  What about this novel idea:  learn to speak English and you can drive a cab in England (if you can qualify in the usual licensing procedures)or ride in one driven by an English-speaking driver no matter what race you are.  But then the usual whiners will think of yet another illogical reason to cry racism.  When the trouble-makers join with the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells, the whining just never stops.</p>

<p>   Why you ask?   Because they surged forward to embrace their own destruction and spent the lives of their tax paying countrymen to see it come to fruition.  So sleep well Torries and labour for the long knife of Islam is close to your traitorous throats.</p>

<p>No, no, no, the racism line was crossed when a white nation was flooded with third worlders it did not ask for.  These types of conflicts are inevitable under the circumstances.  You can have freedom or equality, but not both.</p>

		<p>I make extra efforts to be served by white people. I enjoy the fellowship, find it easier to talk, sometimes make friends, and often learn something new. I only have a limited number of such opportunities so I prefer to deal with whites when possible. It makes my life better. My experience is that I get more out of contact with whites than with non-whites. I disagree with the tone of this article that there is something wrong, sick, or evil when I try to get the most out of my social contacts. </p>

		<p>Let me tell you a secret of the taxi business.  You don&rsquo;t have to take whatever driver comes when you call the dispatcher.  Here&rsquo;s the thing:  Don&rsquo;t call the dispatcher.  Call a taxi driver yourself.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:  When you find a taxi driver you like (for whatever reason), get his card.  All taxi drivers have cards with their cell phone number on it.  Collect as many of these cards as you can.  Then when you need a cab, call the driver.  If you have 3 of these numbers, you should have no problem getting a cab whenever you want one.</p>

<p><br>
I would rather put the question this way:<br>
&#8220;Can you imagine the poor Japanese tourist, who expected to see English people representing English culture, to find himself in an area that resembles Pakistan or a Carribean town?  Is it fair to the tourist?&#8221;</p>
<p>You will come to the conclusion that mass immigration is never fair to the tourist, because it transforms the destination country to a point where its original culture - the one the tourist seeked to experience - is lost. If every European town is going to be multicultural, what is the point of traveling anyway, since I can get the same &#8220;multicultural experience&#8221; at any town in my country?  Why bother traveling to London?<br>
Contrary to that, I&rsquo;d better prefer a trip to Japan, where I can experience a unique culture without finding myself lost in e.g. little Algeria or Senegal (as it&rsquo;d be the case if I travelled to Marseille, France).</p>

		<p>Non-whites have learned that if they make a charge of racism, that white people will run for the hills and surrender to whatever ridiculous demand they make. As long as it continues to work, the charge of racism will continue to be made. It doesn&rsquo;t have to make sense  &mdash;  it just has to work, and it does.</p>

<p>Well what did all these taxi companies do say in the 1940&rsquo;s before mass immigration? Answer, they hired native drivers. Without &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; drivers, these taxi companies would once again have to hire natives.</p>

		<p>There is a far more serious reason behind the decision to display&#8221;English Speaking Driver&#8221; logos.Asian cab drivers are a proven menace to white(especially blonde)women,whom they consider to be little more than prostitutes.One such driver was recently convicted of the rape and murder of a 17 year old schoolgirl in Southampton,and there have been innumerable instances of assault and harrassment.The English drivers were responding in what they assumed was the only way that did not transgress New Labour&rsquo;s tyrannical &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; legislation.How wrong they were.  </p>

		<p>So in this day and age, not only do various religious groups (i.e. Islamics) apparently constitute a racial group, but now each language is a racial group?  Hmmm&hellip;.  maybe I should jump on the bandwagon and declare homosexuality to be a separate racial category (I&rsquo;m being sarcastic, of course).

		<p>It just shows that White on non-White &#8220;racism&#8221; is a non issue when all they have to gripe about is something as absurd and as petty as this. I live in San Francisco, and I see &#8220;we speak [blank] language here&#8221; signs all the time. I&rsquo;ve even seen Chinese shops advertising that they cater to Spanish speakers. It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;race thing&#8221; at all, it&rsquo;s just an unfortunate necessity in multicultural societies, if a business wants a large customer base.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t know how it works in England, but without ethnic taxi drivers, the number of white taxi drivers in finality killed by non-whites would be considerably higher than it is today. And the total number of taxi drivers killed, robbed, and bullied, higher than the total today. </p>

		<p>This has to be the most utterly demented use of the term racism yet.</p>
<p>Merely noting a qualification is now racist?  Presumably lesser qualified minorities must now be protected from anybody with better qualifications.  Advertising &#8220;Twenty years without an accident&#8221;, or &#8220;air-conditioned&#8221;, or perhaps &#8220;GPS-equipped&#8221; are also racist, since persons of certain &#8220;disadvantaged races or groups&#8221; may not share these attributes.</p>

		<p>I recall a cab ride in a capital city in Australia. My wife and I got in the cab and greeted the driver - he ignored us. I spoke again - he completely ignored me. At the end of the trip, I asked how much and without even looking at me, or speaking to me, the (muslim) driver pointed to the meter. A thoroughly rude and unpleasant fellow!<br>
Needless to say, I&rsquo;ll never get in a cab driven by one of that lot again!</p>
<p>Re above article - come on people, this is England!</p>
<p>&#8220;Campaign group Show Racism the Red Card demanded the stickers be taken down from the cab windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whose cab is it? What possibly authority does this silly group of &#8216;anti-racist heroes&rsquo; have to make such a demand?</p>

		<p>The wording was printed on a piece of paper which looks like a St. George&rsquo;s Cross (English) flag. As the St. George&rsquo;s Cross has an association with the Crusaders, that&rsquo;s what really upset them I&rsquo;ll bet; not the &#8220;English spoken here&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now considered racist (by the loony left) for British common folk to fly the Union Flag (aka Union Jack) or the English flag of St. George.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the leftist movement leading towards a situation where Great Britain ceases to exist and becomes just a region of the EUSSR.</p>

If the cabbies of Southampton want to make some <i>real</i> money   &mdash;   now that they&rsquo;ve generated all this publicity   &mdash;   they should start a website and sell those &lsquo;This vehicle operated by an English speaking driver&rsquo; signs to drivers (and not just of taxis) throughout the entire English-speaking world. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d gladly buy one to put in the window of my own car here several thousand miles from England. It would definitely be worth spending a few dollars to annoy all the immigrants in my area   &mdash;   and to remind them which language is spoken in this country. </p>

<p>This is similar to the Southern USA where it is considered an affront to blacks and liberals to fly the Confederate flag.</p>
<p>Often when people are conquered their culture is ridiculed and they are &#8220;discouraged&#8221; in various ways from honoring their heroes, ethnicity and heritage.  This has happened here in the South and all through history.  </p>
<p>Simply put, the conquerors consider themselves culturally superior to those they have overtaken.</p>

		<p> Notice how the media reports this story. If they didn&rsquo;t mention it a lot of people wouldn&rsquo;t know about the racism. See how the media is cramming political correctness down your throats. By mentioning this story the media is brainwashing you. Whereas if they didn&rsquo;t report on  this, no brainwashing.

		<p>I am an English speaking Southampton taxi driver displaying the sign. This was never a race issue only a language issue. English is one of the most widely used languages worldwide. The officials made this appear a race issue not us. We are not and have never been opposed to anyone displaying a sign regardless of nationality providing they can speak and understand English, thats what our customers want. We have been threatened with having our licences revoked if these signs are not removed but we will not remove them as that would be like agreeing with the officials that the signs were racist. A language cannot be racist. The amount of support we have recieved worldwide goes to show the tension people are feeling. We thankyou for your support.</p>

		<p>After boarding a taxi driven by a young Pakistani at the Train Station in Preston, Lancashire, I gave the driver the address I wanted. After noticing his puzzled looks I mentioned that it was in the direction of the Football (Soccer) Stadium, but that was all I knew. When it was clear that the driver was completely lost and hadn&rsquo;t a clue as to where he was going I asked him to either call the radio operator of look at his map. He hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea what I was talking about and kept repeating  &#8216;you say football ground&rsquo;  and began cruising around some streets near the stadium, apparently hoping he would chance upon the address I wanted which was actually a Church. Since he couldn&rsquo;t understand English, and I am unable to speak Urdu. Anyway it was impossible to communicate with the alleged taxi driver and I had no choice but to get out and find my own way. Luckily for me it was a sunny day.  I e-mailed the Preston Licensing Board about the incident, but as expected, heard nothing.  Obviously these people have neither the brains nor the imagination to foresee such a situation occurring perhaps to a young girl passenger or an elderly person on a dark, wet night finding themselves in a similar predicament. Since I had to go again the week after, an Asian driver was again first in line on the rank. This time I asked him point blank if he spoke English, which he did, otherwise I would have refused to get in. Since my first priority was to get to my destination it mattered to me very much whether the driver spoke English and not whether I was likely to upset the PC brigade or the loony left.</p>

		<p>The Council say if enough  people complain then we&rsquo;ll  sdo something.  And you know  what will happen now, the &#8216;anti racist&rsquo; factions and  their  Asian/Black friends will do just that. They did the same  to shut down a Face book campaign to set up to stop a church being  converted  into a mosque. <br>
(See the BNP website for details of this)  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s  really terrible what these  filthy red dogs are  doing to my country nowadays,in the name of &#8216;Harmony.&rsquo;  </p>
