			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry O&rsquo;Connor, Big Journalism, February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It started with a blog post at something called One People&rsquo;s Project, in which someone named Daryle Jenkins claimed:<blockquote>(In 2006) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was this white supremacist forum that we had called attention to and eventually attended that featured American Renaissance&rsquo;s Jared Taylor and National Review&rsquo;s homophobe extraordinaire John Derbyshire. It was originally supposed to be held at the building of the conservative activist organization Leadership Institute until it was forced to move to another location.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>There was also a photographer there, and lo and behold this picture has surfaced of a now familiar face attending the forum  &mdash;  James O&rsquo;Keefe.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Keefe was manning a table at a forum of suit-and-tie Nazis.</p>
<p>A DC area photographer snapped a photo of O&rsquo;Keefe as he maintained a literature table near the panelists.<br>
</blockquote>The photograph that One People&rsquo;s Project shows as its proof is cropped and just shows O&rsquo;Keefe from the shoulders up.  It doesn&rsquo;t show that he is sitting at all, let alone at a table, let alone &#8220;manning&#8221; the table at the event apparently hosted by the Robert Taft Club.</p>
<p>Max Blumenthal  &mdash;  son of Clinton apparatchik &#8220;Sid Vicious&#8221; Blumenthal  &mdash;  at Salon.com picked up on the story and extrapolated even more:<blockquote>According to One People&rsquo;s Project founder Daryle Jenkins, O&rsquo;Keefe was manning the literature table at the gathering that brought together anti-Semites, professional racists and proponents of Aryanism.<br>
</blockquote>But Salon wasn&rsquo;t happy with the headshot that OPP ran, so they cropped his face and photoshopped him in a white suit (surprised it wasn&rsquo;t a hood and robe):<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="text-center"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">  <tr>    <td align="center" width="300"><img src="/news/2010/02/05/ar-in-news.jpg" alt="okeefe"><br><img src="/graphics/spacer.gif" width="300" height="4" border="o"><small><b>James O&rsquo;Keefe, photoshopped.</b></small>    </td>  </tr></table></div></p>
<p>Within an hour or so the Village Voice got really creative on its media blog and added a little more to the mix:<blockquote>James O&rsquo;Keefe, the videographer famous for taking down ACORN (and infamous for trying to take down Senator Landrieu), organized a speaking forum for white supremacists, and was even photographed manning the event&rsquo;s merchandise table.<br>
</blockquote>That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;ve gone from O&rsquo;Keefe attending the event to O&rsquo;Keefe manning a literature table to O&rsquo;Keefe organizing the entire event!</p>
<p>This is what the Left does.  This is how they do it.</p>
<p>We would think that Mr. Blumenthal at Salon or Stephen Thrasher at the Village Voice, as responsible reporters, might have called Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe to get his response to the allegations made in an obscure blog. But no. Instead they ran the story and (in the case of the Voice) actually added new and juicy lies to the myth.</p>
<p>Well, here at Big Journalism we think it&rsquo;s a good idea to actually seek the truth.</p>
<p>So we spoke with James O&rsquo;Keefe today. This is what he tells us:<blockquote>1. He was not &#8220;manning a table&#8221; at the event<br>
2. He was not involved with the organization or operations of the event.<br>
3. He attended the event with many of his Leadership Institute co-workers since it was right across the street from their building in Arlington, Va., and it was organized by other LI associates.<br>
4. The organizer who is being called a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; is half Jewish and half Korean.<br>
5. One of the panelist was an African-American named Kevin Martin.<br>
6. The event was forced to move to a Georgetown University building in Arlington, not at a cross-burning.<br>
</blockquote>We know all this because we called Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe and asked him. Which is more than other media outlets have done.</p>
<p>We also spoke with Daryle Jenkins of One People&rsquo;s Project, the man who started this entire legend. We asked if he had a photograph that actually showed O&rsquo;Keefe &#8220;manning the table&#8221; as has been reported, and he said that this cropped photo was all they had. His claim that Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe &#8220;manned&#8221; the table of literature is based on eye-witnesses who were at the event.</p>
<p>We are supposed to believe that four years after the fact these eyewitnesses remember O&rsquo;Keefe being there, remember what he was doing, and even remember what was on the table in front of him.</p>
<p>Mr. Jenkins only produced the name of one witness: David Weigel who, at the time was a reporter with Reason Magazine. We called Mr. Weigel and he denied ever telling Mr. Jenkins that Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe was &#8220;manning the table.&#8221; Indeed, he has already gone on record denying he said that.</p>
<p>Here is the story they actually have:</p>
<p>James O&rsquo;Keefe attended a forum years ago that dealt with race and politics. The forum was located at a Georgetown University building (that&rsquo;s right, a 21-year-old man attended an event on a college campus). The forum had as one of its three speakers a controversial figure, Jared Taylor, with a track record of making racist statements. He was being debated by two other people including Mr. Martin (taking issue with the racist figure). Mr. Taylor has also appeared with Phil Donohue, Queen Latifa and Paula Zahn on their TV shows to debate race. Are the audience members of the Donohue show racist for sitting and watching that debate?</p>
<p>Honestly, that isn&rsquo;t much of a story. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you put Mr. O&rsquo;Keefe at a table full of racist literature and you say that he was manning the table. And you say you have a picture proving it. And you make it sound like he was one of the organizers of this event. And you call the event a &#8220;White Supremacist Conference&#8221;. Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now you&rsquo;ve got a story.</p>
<p>Only problem: It&rsquo;s all a lie.<br>

		<p>Larry O&rsquo;Connor at Big Journalism, a Breitbart production, can&rsquo;t seem to take the next crucial step.  He debunks the O&rsquo;Keefe-&#8220;white supremacy&#8221; links, but then calls JT &#8220;racist.&#8221;  He hasn&rsquo;t evidently thought to consider that, like almost everything else the left does, that invective about JT is also either a lie or highly distorted.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;This is what the Left does. This is how they do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, that is what these Reds do, and how they do it; they have no other recourse, because everything that they believe in is degenerate fantasy. Thus, fabricating the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; has become their only modus operandi. </p>
<p>With that considered, can anything they ever allege to be &ldquo;truth&rdquo; be taken seriously?</p>
<p>Should a doctor make money equal to a janitor; should a black or Hispanic terrorist be idolized over a white hero or president? </p>
<p>Of course not, ever!</p>
<p>But, this is what we have come to; the only things &ldquo;considered&rdquo; as being the &ldquo;truth,&ldquo; are the twisted and demented. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

<p>And in case anyone is wondering the half-Jewish, half-Korean organizer mentioned in the story is Marcus Epstein, an excellent young writer.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how the left concocts lies for what they see as the greater good.  I recently watched an exchange between the head of NOW and a pro-lifer.  The NOW chair proclaimed that 1/3 of women (presumably Americans) have at least one abortion in their lifetimes.  I found that figure to be suspicious, so checked online and found a figure proclaiming 2% per year, with 47% being repeats.  This was for women aged 15 to 44, which would cover almost all pregnancies occurring.  Somehow, NOW had extrapolated such figures into its 1/3 in a lifetime.  Also, percapita rates of abortions are higher among blacks and Hispanics, with 1/2 of black pregnancies aborted, which further skew statistics.  </p>

		<p>The only real answer to these sorts of charges goes something like this:  Whites have been the overwhelming majority of victims of racist violence during the last 50 years, with tens of thousands of innocent people, including thousands of children, murdered for reasons at least aggravated by racism  during that period, and millions, including children, raped as well.    The editors and reporters at &#8220;Blank&#8221; (you could put any major media outlet&rsquo;s name in there, they&rsquo;re all pretty much the same) knew full well what was happening on the streets of America but systematically lied about it,  suppressed information about racist violence against whites as a matter of conscious policy,  and any reasonable person can only conclude that the suppression of these facts has an enabling effect on that violence, and that the staff of the &#8220;Blank&#8221; knows it,  and thus is guilty of  knowingly promoting that violence.   That is the conclusion that they themselves would reach if, say, the Serbian press had treated Serbian violence against individual Croats the same way.   The &#8220;Blank&#8221; lied, and children died.   People who have spent their entire adulthoods sponsoring and participating in mass racist violence don&rsquo;t have a  right to lecture others on morality or even basic decency.    More whites were murdered in New York City in the 1960s in interracial crimes than blacks were in Mississippi, what did the &#8220;Voice&#8221; ever have to say about it.    </p>
