<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/nyregion/06housing.html">2 Bronx Communities Are Accused of Preventing Blacks From Buying Homes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cara Buckley, New York Times, February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Fair Housing Justice Center, a nonprofit group, sued Edgewater Park, its nearby sister community, Silver Beach Gardens, and one of its former longtime residents, the Realtor Amelia Lewis, claiming racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, sprang from an investigation the housing group conducted in September and October 2009, in which a white couple and an African-American couple inquired about buying homes in the communities. Both were &#8220;test&#8221; couples who worked for the housing group and said they were looking for homes priced below $300,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the white woman was warmly welcomed by Ms. Lewis, and was quickly shown nine available homes in both Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the end, it said, Ms. Lewis refused to show the African-American couple any home in either Edgewater Park or Silver Beach Gardens. {snip}</p>
<p>The suit says that 2000 Census figures show that while blacks account for 35 percent of owner-occupied homes in the Bronx, they account for less than 1 percent of the 1,100 homes in Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens. {snip}</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can blame those realtors.  All you have to do is look at the performance of black-owned mortgages vs. white ones, and do the math.  Blacks are poor risks, all too often they don&rsquo;t keep up their property, and the behavior of many black children is reprehensible.  (After teaching 1 year in a primarily black elementary school, I was SO grateful to escape to a primarily Hispanic one, because the level of violence, even among first graders, in the black school, was astoundingly high.)  Nobody wants blacks around BECAUSE OF THEIR POOR BEHAVIOR and their penchant for violent crime, AND for the fact that they often don&rsquo;t pay their bills.  Nobody needs that.</p>

		<p><i>Ms. Lewis went on to say that Edgewater Park was &ldquo;not wonderful for everybody,&rdquo; the suit said, adding that it was mostly Irish and Italian, &ldquo;kind of prejudice&rdquo; and &ldquo;like Archie Bunker territory.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>In the end, it said, Ms. Lewis refused to show the African-American couple any home in either Edgewater Park or Silver Beach Gardens.</p>
<p>Assuming that the above quote and actions are accurate, my initial response is &#8220;How could a Realtor be foolish enough to say something like that, and to refuse to show a specific property that any minority requests to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Property rights issues aside, the law is clear. You just can&rsquo;t do that. </p>
<p>Regarding apartment rentals, I&rsquo;ve never understood why managers don&rsquo;t insist on a credit check (paid for by the potential renter,) before committing to anything. A tester wouldn&rsquo;t give out their &#8220;real&#8221; information, and many if not most, undesirable tenants would be weeded out by the credit check. </p>
<p>Sure, some good tenants might have poor credit for valid, understandable reasons, but the manager could cross that bridge when it comes. I don&rsquo;t think that most testers would ever get that far.<br/>

These groups running sting operations to ferret out racial discrimination are becoming more common.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, we have a group called HOME (Housing Opportunities Made Equal). They&rsquo;ve been running these stings in the suburbs and the small pockets of white neighborhoods in the city. </p>
<p>Once in a while, they catch a landlord running a property and the courts impose a fine and the landlord is made to attend a &#8216;re-education&rsquo; training program.</p>
<p>Last week, HOME was given a grant of $1.7 million.</p>
<p>Their mission statement is:</p>
<p>&#8220;HOME&rsquo;s mission is to promote the value of diversity and to ensure the people of Western New York an equal opportunity to live in the housing and communities of their choice  &mdash;   through education, advocacy, enforcement of fair housing laws, and the creation of housing opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they mean is, &#8216;if it&rsquo;s a white neighborhood, it must be destroyed&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p><i>The investigation, she said, was prompted by an August article in The New York Times, in which residents said their communities were largely unknown and their streets largely sealed off. Usually it behooves moderately priced communities to get the word out, she said, to drive up demand and prices. <b>&ldquo;Any time anything&rsquo;s hidden or secret,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have to ask, &lsquo;Why would you want to be hidden?&rsquo; &rdquo;</b></i></p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. How about to avoid unnecessary harassment from ever meddling (expletive deleted)s like this housing &#8220;justice&#8221; bunch. Or maybe to keep your community the way you want to live in it. Perhaps even so undesirables don&rsquo;t come looking for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that might be it.</p>

		<p>The current euphemism for black in marketing circles is &#8220;goverment employee&#8221; or &#8220;civil servant&#8221;  There are virtually no White government workers as the last of those hired before the discrimination laws went into effect around 1970.</p>
<p>I work in marketing and more and more government emplyee is the red flag that means the prospective buyer of anything from cars to houses to vacations to anything is a typical black,won&rsquo;t show up for appointments, won&rsquo;t be able to afford what he or she wants, won&rsquo;t tell the truth and will  not make the payments.</p>
<p>The answer to the question &#8220;what are the schools like?&#8221; can be answered, lots of civil servants children.  That means raucous, noisy, dangerous out of control blacks have destroyed the schools.</p>
<p>Ever notice those real estate ads that only want to show homes to pre approved prospects?  It&rsquo;s a way of screening out blacks.</p>

<p>You are correct. The law is the law. Period. If the Fair Housing Justice Center can prove intentional discrimination, then the realtors in question will have to pay for violating the law. </p>

		<p>After decades of struggling to integrate housing, the do-gooders should declare they&rsquo;ve done what they can and the rest will have to evolve on its own.  But, of course, there&rsquo;s grant money to be had, so the fight will go on.  <br/>
I would never want to live where people don&rsquo;t want me.  I&rsquo;m a middle-income hillbilly, and I&rsquo;m comfortable living with others like me.  And I believe that 99% of people feel the same.  <br/>
Much of the housing integration that occurred decades ago was done in civil-rights test cases and by moneygrubbers who were trying to block-bust in order to drive out whites.  Then houses would be sold at top dollar, on land contracts, to blacks  &mdash;  who often defaulted and had to turn the property right back to the landlord, who resold it.  </p>

		<p>To poster #3.  I also worked for two years in a school that was 30% black and 70% Latino.  There was trouble every day, in every class, and 95% of the time it was the black students. Fights, throwing chairs, calling out ceaselessly with ghetto slurs and foul language. The LAtino students, while a few were gang bangers, mostly were not, and they looked incredulously upon their minority peers with the expression, &#8220;Wha&hellip;?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since the &#8220;law&#8221; usurps the right of freedom of association to whites by forcing them to live among blacks, the only way to deal with the situation is to allow blacks to move in - and then make it PERFECTLY CLEAR they are not welcome.  There are many ways to do this; one must only use his imagination.  In the end, such blacks will complain that, had they only known they would be so unwelcome, they would not have bought the house.  Well, such is the nature of the &#8220;law&#8221; that whites were not permitted to notify them prior to the purchase.</p>
<p>The &#8220;law&#8221; does not allow those who seek housemates to specify race when places advertisements.  Therefore, when somebody like me is looking for a housemate, I&rsquo;ll cast a wide net.  Black applicants will waste their time coming to see the place and meet with me.  In the end, I&rsquo;ll find them &#8220;not suitable&#8221; because of &#8220;other reasons&#8221;.  In this way, racial minorities might also be victims of anti-discrimination laws.</p>

		<p>When Guyanese and Trindadians took over South Richmond Hill in Queens in the early &rsquo;90s their realtors (once of the first businesses they bought into in the neighborhood) used every trick in the book to get whites out and their own people in. This included block-busting and deliberately not showing properties to anyone but their own. The regular folk were in on it, too. One of them flat-out told me that they threw garbage on white people&rsquo;s properties and had loud parties to drive us out. None of this attracted the attention of the DA, the city councilmen, state assemblymen and senators or congressional reps. One of them was Gregory Meeks, black, who did nothing as other blacks were given the same treatment south of Rockaway Blvd., which had been a rare middle-class quiet black neighborhood for years.</p>
<p>The funny thing, unless you&rsquo;re a white lib invested in the  multicult, is that the takeover of the neighborhood was as clear a rejection of multiculturalism as you could find. Guyana is about 35% black and Trinidad even more, yet I almost never saw a black Guyanese or Trinidadian in the neighborhood. Almost all were of Indian descent. Now what way is that to treat your fellow countrymen?</p>
<p>Good luck to you Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens. Hope you can hold out as long as possible.<br/>

		<p>Salespeople in any business generally will, if given the chance, pick white clientele over black, simply because plenty of empirical observation has taught them that they&rsquo;re less likely to be wasting their time with whites.  Of course, this is hardly an immutable law, and applying it sometimes backfires, with very entertaining results.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a retired auto dealer, and about twenty five years ago, in my Porsche-Audi store, a rather elderly and shabbily-dressed older black man came in, walked over to a Porsche 928S and asked about the price.  The experienced salesmen all made tracks for the mensroom, the coffee pot, or grabbed their phones and pretended to be busy.  We had a brand new saleslady on the floor that morning (her first day) who approached him, looked at the window sticker, and quoted him the MSRP (those were the glory days when Porsches typically brought MSRP).  He asked her how soon it could be got ready, to which she replied that it was prepped and ready for delivery.  The old gentleman, never having driven the car, said he&rsquo;d be back in a couple of hours.  The salesmen chortled and advised the new girl that she&rsquo;d never see the guy again, not to worry, that these things happened, etc, &#8220;don&rsquo;t let it get you down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, the old codger, true to his word, showed up a couple of hours later bearing a cashiers check for the full amount, including sales tax, went throught the delivery process, and drove off.  He came back a month later and bought a 944 for his girlfriend from the new saleslady. Turned out the old guy owned four adult book stores downtown.</p>
<p>The moral being that salespeople who hurriedly pre-qualify people sometimes miss good opportunities, and a good salesperson, by asking the right questions, can very quickly<br/>
and effectively qualify potential buyers and often steer them into something, perhaps not which they came in for, which is more suited to their means.<br/>

		<p>There are many organizations out there that troll rental and sale ads to find cases of &#8220;discrimination&#8221; in renting or sales. When we first started renting out basement we had a couple of very strange calls where people were seemingly trying to trip us up so they could charge us with some sort of discrimination.</p>

		<p>Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t followed Madison Grant&rsquo;s link to the New York Times article SHOULD.  The co-ops were formed in the Seventies and Eighties, and managed to keep the wolves at bay for a little more than two decades.  During that time, the children who lived there were able to live in bathing suits all summer&hellip;running between their houses and the beach without a care&hellip; the kind of life for families that has disappeared all over America.  And there it was IN THE BRONX, of all places.  In college, I actually met a gorgeous ultra-blond guy, of Huguenot descent, who grew up in Silver Beach.  More amazing was his upper-middle-class accent: something I&rsquo;d not expect in a borough known, to the rest of America, as extremely rough.  I said so, and he then told me that there were &#8216;good parts&rsquo; of The Bronx, down by the water.  This is what he was referring to.  So the existence of these neighborhoods is doubly miraculous.</p>
<p>But now, it&rsquo;s OVER.  I can see two reasons why:<br/>
  1)They allowed listings with realtors.  <br/>
  2)They cooperated with The Times, on this article.</p>
<p>Realtors are now snitches, as mandated by law.  The good ones, the ones you can trust to do the right thing, as we see here, get in big trouble.<br/>
And publicity only brings trouble.  I agree with Mr. Grant that there was a direct cause and effect here, between the article in The Times, and what is clearly an initiative to destroy those two rare enclaves for middle-class white Americans.</p>
<p>You can be certain, though, that no &#8216;testers&rsquo; will be sent to crash the co-op buildings on Park Avenue.  To do so would swiftly bring down the fire from the sky, upon whatever little bureaucrat was so foolish as to cause trouble for the Plutocracy.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Blockbusting&#8221; was common in Detroit in the 1960&rsquo;s and did much to damage Detroit permanently.  HUD and speculators had an interest in depressing property values so that they could &#8220;snatch up&#8221; undervalued properties.  When HUD came through a neighborhood, they would buy up the BEST housing stock and demolish it, leaving the shacks standing.<br/>
The only way around the &#8220;anti-freedom of association&#8221; laws is to form a &#8220;clandestine&#8221; (private) whites-only real estate network.  With today&rsquo;s computer encryption methods it is possible to attract the &#8220;right clientele&#8221; and exclude others.<br/>
A &#8220;sixty minutes&#8221; segment a while back did a comparison of upper class black and white subdivisions in an Atlanta suburb.  Near the end of the segment, they ADMITTED that identical housing in the all-black subdivision was approximately 30% cheaper.  Perhaps inadvertantly they proved a point.<br/>

		<p>How do we know that the law actually requires them to do so?  Judges can be wrong, calling things laws that never were actually laws.</p>
<p>If it seems unusual that people should be forbidden from working how they want in a private matter between two parties, such as the showing of property, then for all I know maybe the courts are wrong and it is not actually illegal.<br/>
 Marbury vs Madison or a similar case addresses it.</p>

		<p>To get around this nonsense, they must use private Organizations, whether it is the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Sons of Italy, Polish-American Halls, and other ethnic, and religiously based groups, like the KofC, to let their members know that there are homes, and other properties, for sale, in specific Neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Doing it this way will by-pass the Realtors, and eliminate the need to advertise Real Estate in Liberal Newsppapers, which will also cut into the Advertising revenue, of such Newspapers. It&rsquo;s a win-win, all around. </p>
<p>The fact that Uncle Sam, through HUD, can tell private Citizens who they can sell their Real property to, in outrageous, and Unconstitutional. Now they want to tell us how much Health Care we can have, which Doctors we can see, and what the Doctors will be able to charge for their services. </p>
<p>So, why did we fight World War II, and the Cold War, again?</p>

<p>A clue is found in the press release, which mentions that the realtor has sold homes in the area for 45 yrs   &mdash;   so she&rsquo;s likely 70 or older.  Any realtor who has entered the profession in the last 30 years would die before saying such things to a client, or &#8220;refusing&#8221; to show them homes (even though it&rsquo;s pointless, since they could just go to another realtor).  It&rsquo;s grounds for summary loss of a license, which they well know.  </p>
<p>Even so   &mdash;   as far as the CASE goes   &mdash;   it has two fatal flaws.  One being that there are no injured parties, and thus no standing.  Two, being that the black couple did not actually deal with either of the co-ops, though the white couple did (if you read the complaint), so there&rsquo;s no basis for comparison for them, unlike for the realtor.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t live too far from one of those communities.  I used to see it everyday on my way to work as I was passing over the bridge.  It stuck out like a sore thumb.  The rest of the Bronx is a dirty, depressing wasteland, and here was this little neighborhood by the water with clean homes and streets.  I was always wonderstruck by the irony.  I always wondered, at the same time, how any enclave of whites could survive there.  The teeming masses in the Bronx are very much teeming all over the streets.  Well, time for the last two white enclaves to experience ethnic cleans- oops, I mean diversity.</p>

		<p>PAT, Marbury vs. Madison has nothing to do with private agreements between parties.  Marbury vs. Madison was the case which back around 1805 most, most unfortuantely established the  supremacy of unelected, life tenured dictatorial Judges over the elected representatives, Presidents, Governors, and the elected legislatures.</p>
<p>Marbury vs Madison was the worst, worst decision ever made by our courts.  It created the Judicial dictatorship that made Brown vs Topeka and the affirmative action laws possible.</p>
<p>One liberal federal Judge could order the military to detain and kill every White person in the country and it would be legal and binding.  No President or congress could countermand the order.</p>
<p>That is the situation Marbury vs Madison created, Judicial supremacy, a throwback to backwoods  Europe 600 AD when the local warlord was Judge, prosecutor, jury and executioner.</p>
<p>Actually, Judicial supremacy was exactly what the founders wanted.  Supremacy by the tools of the elite, the Judges.  Let the people elect the President, the elite will rule through the Judges was what the founders intended.</p>

		<p>RESPONSE TO FHJC LAWSUIT AGAINST EDGWATER PARK</p>
<p><br/>
                Edgewater Park is a tightly knit community sitting on the Long Island Sound in a hidden pocket of the Bronx to quote the February 5th New York Times article headlined &#8221; Two Bronx Communities Accused of Preventing Blacks from Buying Homes&#8221;. It is as one resident put it in an earlier interview with The Times, &#8220;a great place for kids because everybody looks out for one another&rsquo;&#8221;. She goes onto say &#8220;its a community within a community&#8221;. <br/>
               A lot of the families that live in Edgewater Park, are third and fourth generations of the community made up mostly of civil servants, decorated police officers and firemen. Edgewater Park also has a long line of cherished and well respected Military Veterans and active duty who are serving  today and have served dating back to World War Two. So, when I think who fought for rights and laws,pardon me if they are the first who come to mind in each and every month. Not just February as FHJC would lead you to believe according to the FHJC website.http://www.fairhousingjustice.org<br/>
             As the story goes, the way the New York Times presents, it seems that the Fair Housing Justice Center ( FHJC) came across a real estate agent who they accused of being racially discriminative towards African Americans who wished to purchase a home in Edgewater Park. It should be noted that A) They did not come across or were interviewed and denied by the members of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative and B) They did not come across nor were denied by the 600 plus homeowners of the Coop who are now unfairly being deemed as racist. All they did was encounter an independent real estate agent who does not work for the COOP, whom they allege thwarted their process of purchasing a home in Edgewater. <br/>
                A requirement to purchase a home in Edgewater Park does in fact require three letters of reference from existing residents. Which is no more racist then a student needing letters of reference to be admitted to Columbia University or for a Law Professor at Columbia needing a letter of reference to join a Country Club.  As in many of these country clubs and Ivy League schools there are many applicants who are denied because they don&rsquo;t fulfill these requirements who happen to be white and of Italian and Irish heritage. <br/>
              Diane l. Houk who ironically was the co founder and executive director for this non profit group until 2009 coincidently  is employed by the law firm of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff and Abady LLP who just happens to be representing FHJC where she is the lead attorney in this case. Be that as it may, Ms Houk was quoted as saying in the same Feb 5TH New York Times article &#8221; Anytime anything is hidden or secret you have to ask why would you want to be hidden?&#8221; As if that were the choice and the intentions geographically of the early residents of Edgewater Park to seclude itself off from the rest of the Bronx nearly a century ago. An open ended question with a hint of conspiracy to tangle the chords of the emotions of people. Common practice for a social justice professional. She goes onto using statistics from the 2000 Census stating &#8220;blacks account for 35% of homeowners in the Bronx yet less than 1% in Edgewater Park and Silver Beach&#8221; as if you should only imply only one conclusion, racism. This of course after acknowledging its a hidden and secret place very few people in the Bronx know about to begin with never mind wanting to buy a home there. However, there are some statistics Ms. Houk chose not to include in her research. In over twenty five years there has been one homicide in Edgewater Park which was committed by a non resident Labor Day Weekend 1998. With the exceptions of public disturbance, criminal mischief disorderly conduct and public drinking, which the COOP has made and continues to make great gains in it is safe to say that Edgewater Park also makes up less than 1% of all crimes committed in the Bronx. We credit this in part to our isolation where everybody knows each other which leads to comments from residents saying they feel safe and are happy to raise their kids here. Now what are we to conclude based on some of these statistics in comparison to what we should conclude based on the census statistics provided by Ms Houk?<br/>
             The residents of Edgewater are  hardworking, middle class,  family oriented good people who although are imperfect, they will not be intimidated nor accept being labeled as intolerant or racists to benefit another social justice club crying wolf  to once again manipulate the emotional chords of its contributors.  So, if the target of this allegation is of a Real Estate Agent it is suggested that it is left as such. But,if there is going to be an attempt to wrongly slander an entire community in the name of social justice you will find out, in this community which doesn&rsquo;t have an organizer it will not tolerate an Alinskey movement in the least bit.</p>

<p>Your narrative in rebuttal reminds me of something similar that happened in Kansas City in the 1970s.  Some whites, in order to keep away the &#8220;there goes the neighborhood&#8221; crowd, technically converted their neighborhood into a country club, and charged a very modest yearly fee for &#8220;belonging.&#8221;  And, of course, you had to belong to the &#8220;country club&#8221; in order to live in that neighborhood.  </p>
<p>This did not sit well with Missouri&rsquo;s Attorney General the time, John Danforth.  (If the name is familiar to you, he was Bush 43&rsquo;s first UN ambassador and spearheaded a &#8220;panel&#8221; that, surprise surprise, found that the Feds did nothing wrong in Waco.  The Danforth family founded Ralston-Purina.  John&rsquo;s brother William was Chancellor at Washington University for many years.)  He sued the country club, and one of the arguments he used in court was that &#8220;$10 a year isn&rsquo;t enough for a country club.&#8221;  He should know, the suburban St. Louis CC he belonged to probably charges $10 per minute dues now.  Anyway, Missouri&rsquo;s chapters of the Citizens Councils got a hold of that quote, and bought billboard space along highways in St. Louis and Kansas City, with that particular quote.  Which contributed to Danforth not winning election to the U.S. Senate the first time he tried in the 70s.  He would later win, and serve three terms in the Senate.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that some &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhoods in NYC get targeted by these &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; groups while other &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhoods are allowed to have their own private police to keep blacks out.  No prizes for guessing what the difference is.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good and thats something that happened in Kansas City. This in fact is not the case here in Edgewater Park. It is not thought of as a country club and anybody who knows Edgewater Park can attest to that. This story contains one real estate agent who all by herself implied her own rules and regulations for the community and as a result of that the entire community is being accused of discrimination. You choose to ignore the two primary factors of what you call a narrative. One the couple in question did not get turned down by anybody in official capacity of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative. Nor two, they were not discouraged or confronted by any of the 600 homeowners of Edgewater Park. This was a real estate agent acting independently. But for matters other than just the relevant facts, the need to tie in an entire community into this particular scenario makes for a better story.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t all black and Hispanic neighborhoods get called out on discrimination?  When whites try to move in, the locals bring out this very strange word called gentrification and they protest against the incursion by whites.  Liberals actually join in and protest gentrification, as well, saying it harms the &#8216;community&rsquo; because property values go up.  I am not kidding.  Where I work, a liberal Jewish lady who tries real hard to pretend she is Hispanic (in all respects) was part of organizing a protest against &#8216;gentrification&rsquo; in a local neighborhood.  Some of us workers whispered among ourselves: &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t it racist to say that white people cannot move somewhere?&#8221;  We never spoke loudly about it, though, or mentioned it to the Jewish lady pretending to be Latina because the PC wave has already completely engulfed this work environment.  It is all very Orwellian.</p>

		<p>#30 Jay.. Yes .. this is the bizarre drama of this era.. our own sacred cow&hellip; &#8220;The Holy Disadvantaged&#8221; The modern lefty jackarsess lacking in a real life or identity, all join hands to {save the minority&rsquo;s}. Its an attempt to gain a cause and seem rightious at the same time. Like the garbage in the Bronx.. the few neigborhoods that are well kept and safe&hellip; are viciously attacked because&hellip;oh how horrible&hellip; they just might prefer the company of their own white kind. The sacred cult of diversity.. worships the diversity of every kind except the white kind&hellip; which must be sacrificed at the feet of the others. There is now rising a slow groundswell of immunity to this cult, my hope is that it knows where to stop.</p>

<p>Yes, but of course these are the same people who complained when whites LEFT the city in the first place (&#8220;white flight&#8221;).  It&rsquo;s the &#8220;damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t&#8221; phenomemon that&rsquo;s been picked up often by commenters here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even been noted by academics   &mdash;   in a wry manner at the beginning of this study by a Duke academic: &#8220;From a naive perspective, it would thus appear that no neighborhood change is beneficial to the poor.&#8221; </p>
