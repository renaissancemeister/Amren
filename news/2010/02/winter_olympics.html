			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Principles of Progressive Politics, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If anyone thinks the United States had finally shed its vile, racist ways with the election of Barack Obama, think again. One simply needs to watch the 2010 Winter Olympics  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s proof that the United States hasn&rsquo;t progressed  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s still the same racist nation it&rsquo;s always been. White institutionalized racism is more alive than ever, and clearly it permeates the USOC (United States Olympic Committee). For those people-of-color who haven&rsquo;t had time to watch the winter Olympics, the USOC&rsquo;s website has photos of the &#8220;Team USA&#8221; athletes:</p>
<p>http://www.teamusa.org/athletes/find</p>
<p>{snip} It <em>seems</em> 95% (or more) of the athletes are white. I thought this nation had moved past Jim Crow laws? Perhaps technically it did, but in practical terms, Jim Crow is alive and well. White privilege once again rears its ugly head and people-of-color are subject to it during two weeks of Winter Olympic games in Vancouver.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The USOC is a publicly funded entity  &mdash;  your tax dollars are funding this racist organization  &mdash;  demand justice!</p>
<p>In looking towards the next Winter Olympics four years from now, mandatory racial quotas must determine the racial/ethnic makeup of &#8220;Team USA 2014&#8221;. Such quotas should reflect the racial breakdown of the United States, percentage-wise. All people of moral character should work towards correcting our de facto Jim Crow society.<br/>

		<p>I looked at the original page, and notes that he links to the ADL, SPLC and Soros while extolling Marx.  Birds of a feather&hellip;  I guess he&rsquo;s upset that the USSR no longer exists to win all those winter olympic medals for the sake of Marx.  On the other hand, the USSR&rsquo;s teams were too white.</p>

		<p>First of all, this is not a real blog.  I believe that the person that wrote this piece is on our side of things, he points out how absurd it would be to compose an olympic team using a quota system.  This is the same blogger that wrote that there are too many heterosexuals and that for diversity puroposes homosexuals should be at least 50 percent of the population.  That leftists would agree with him shows just how insane they are.</p>

		<p>I seriously thought this was Swift-ian satire until i went to the source page.   I&rsquo;m sure many AR readers would write something like this to mock the multiculturalist point of view.  The fact that is not possible to present opinions like this as a gross exaggeration is, to me, quite unsettling.</p>

		<p>This guy also states in one of his older blogs that if white people were a minority there would be peace and justice.  I wonder if he&rsquo;s ever heard of a place called Africa?  Or is that white peoples&rsquo; fault too?  Colonialism is causing them to kill each still - it&rsquo;s like Obama blaming Bush for everything - they&rsquo;d keep blaming white people even after we&rsquo;re all gone because they can&rsquo;t take responsibility for their actions</p>

		<p>We need to see all these complaints about too few blacks and too many whites reach logical conclusion.   Diversity Czar Mark Lloyd said whites in media need to step down to make room for people of color and gays.  We need to see that moral theme be put into practice. We need to see the blacks demand that white politicians resign because there are too many whites in power.  </p>

		<p>The only other race that&rsquo;s capable of performing well and has a notable representation in the Winter Olympics are the East Asians, but there aren&rsquo;t many of them in the US. So it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that the American team is mostly White. </p>

		<p>This article just proves how utterly insane this whole diversity thing has gotten. There is absolutely no thought given to the ludicrous nature of the statements made its only about the color. I think the author should march straight down to the Harlem Curling Club and interview the black curlers their to poll their opinions and outrage concerning being left out of the Olympics. I was just thinking the other day about all the great African American cross country skiers the US has produced as well as the strength of the Latino contribution to US speed-skating. Give me a break&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. </p>

		<p>Perhaps we can take this to a whole entirely new level.  In an olympic team of say 30 people there should be three blacks,  three hispanics which at least one is illegal, one oriental, one American Indian, four homosexuals with one being a trannie and one a hermaphrodite, two handicapped people, one blind and the other in a wheelchair, one dwarf, one retarded person, one satanist, one jew, one buddhist, one muslim, and so forth and so on.</p>

		<p>Regarding racism in the VANCOUVER GAMES - Perhaps we should call the summer olympics racist because majority of competing athletes are black. Your view is very narrow and prejudiced.<br/>
Certain athletes possess specific physical skills which translate into them being better formers. Swimming as an example. Do you wish to call the sport of swimming racist because the bulk of the competitors are caucasian. Open your brain and be fair in your assessment and judgment.</p>

		<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see here.  We&rsquo;ve got one black speed skater.  We have a ton of gay guys in the ice skating events.  Asians are also on our speed skating team.  We have gay girl skiers.  However, I just don&rsquo;t know of ANY blacks who are willing to risk their lives learning to ski, doing moguls, downhill, and especially not ski jumping!  It&rsquo;s too **** cold, for one thing.  And most of &#8216;em have 10 kids and no education, so there goes the money for skis and ski trips.  And the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t all that thrilled with snow stuff either; do they even HAVE a winter Olympics team in Mexico???  The IDIOT who wrote this article needs to take realities and preferences into consideration:  blacks and Mexicans aren&rsquo;t into snow and ice, period - the few who are, are total anomalies in their respective cultures.  What are you gonna do - hogtie a likely looking bunch of Mexicans and blacks, throw &#8216;em on skates or skis, and force them to learn?  Hey, they aren&rsquo;t stupid; they can make more money in football or baseball, dummy!</p>

		<p>Ah, the lunacy of certain radicals. I say certain because I don&rsquo;t think the vast majority are as extreme as this one fellow. That being said, his arguments are absurd. </p>
<p>As pointed out in earlier comments, no one seems to mind when our Olympic basketball teams are 99% black, despite the fact that blacks are only 13% of the overall population. The fact that the NFL is majority black also doesn&rsquo;t inspire outrage. 13% of the population dominates the two most popular American sports, and yet no calls for diversity and &#8220;inclusion&#8221; in these two sports. </p>
<p>However, the fact that whites are over-represented in Winter Games (note: WINTER GAMES) is evidence that there is racism and a lack of diversity. Many blacks and other non-whites just don&rsquo;t care about Winter Sports (how many blacks do you see in the NHL?). </p>
<p>To certain anti-racists, facts don&rsquo;t matter. Logic doesn&rsquo;t matter. Anything that gets in the way of &#8220;diversity&#8221; must be abolished. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is really just an attempt to eliminate whites. &#8220;We need more diversity&#8221; is really just a euphemism for &#8220;we need fewer white people.&#8221; </p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to have an equal number of blacks and whites on a national scale, simply because there are a lot more whites than blacks (despite our numbers declining). </p>
<p>Once Hispanics take over, there will be more than enough &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Of course, because &#8220;diversity&#8221; is such a wonderful virtue that we should all embrace! Sarcasm off. </p>

		<p>Whoever is writing this garbage about the Winter Olympics being too white, racist, etc. knows that; as a whole, most non-whites have never chosen to live in the cold weather, let alone work hard towards a winter sport in the cold weather. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a progression over the years, decades. It takes training. It takes commitment. It takes being able to stand cold weather.<br/>
Things don&rsquo;t change over night. No one can make a non-white participate if they don&rsquo;t want to!   </p>

		<p>Absolutely ridiculous. Just take a look at the NFL, NBA, etc. or even the Summer Games. If anything, it&rsquo;s proof that Blacks lack the ability and/or interest to compete in the Winter Games. I&rsquo;m Black myself, and although I must say that racism exists (and not just against Blacks, but against Whites and other humans as well), things like this are VERY far-fetched. I am not too fond of many of the liberals, and I am confused as to why many of my people will jump all over this (well, the ones that are paying attention, that is; most Blacks probably won&rsquo;t even watch the Winter Olympics).</p>

		<p>Could it not just be that no &#8220;people of colour&#8221; as he put it were good enough to qualify for the American team. Fair enough he would have an argument if there was proof they denied any minorities in but they may not have wanted to enter. Pretty much every country has a white population but there are no White people on every team by that logic are they no also racist. ( I don&rsquo;t think that.) what I do think is people like this honestly believe that only White people can be racist </p>

Same with Tiger Woods. If he had been a White guy with the exact same talents as Woods, he never would have monopolized the air waves to the degree that Woods has. If the White guy had dallied to the degree that Tiger did, most of the attention would have been limited to Insider, ET and Access Hollywood. </p>

<p>I see it as a propaganda issue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told that everyone is equal and the same. The problem is that this doesn&rsquo;t appear in outcomes. There are clear distinctions of abilities.</p>
<p>To counter the truth, you must promote a lie.</p>
<p>Finding one or two exceptions is supposed to prove that everyone is capable of the same outcome if we only promote and invest in those people who don&rsquo;t appear to succeed in white dominated venues.</p>
<p>Hence, a Tiger Woods and a Shani Davis are supposed to prove that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is a failed belief system.</p>

		<p>These sports are regional to parts of the country that are lily white. In addition minorities generaly aren&rsquo;t interested in them. I bet a black kid who became interested in pursuing hockey rather than basketball would probably face ridicule and ostracism in his own community for &#8220;acting white.&#8221; Not to mention a lot of these winter sports are the pursuits of the wealthy.</p>

<p>Not committing adultery against his race mixing, race traitoring white wife by getting jiggy with beautiful women of color. I find it offensive that he sexed with whitish looking women when he could have had any black woman in the world, or a whole tribe of them and their daughters.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods is a traitor to the black race because he chose the white race for his most intimate contact.  If find that offensive and demand and apology and pay off.</p>
