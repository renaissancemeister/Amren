	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The class &#8220;Teacher, School, and Society&#8221; (EDN 200) is required of all education majors. When students take Maurice Martinez for the class they get a special treat. Maurice [Maurice Martinez, an education professor at UNC-Wilmington] teaches them &#8220;Black English.&#8221; In 2003, he even copyrighted course materials to make white future teachers fluent in &#8220;Black English.&#8221;</p>
<p>To think I used to call ebonics the &#8220;new black death.&#8221; In retrospect, that was mighty Caucasian of me  &mdash;  and that isn&rsquo;t a good thing. If only I had taken Professor Martinez for &#8220;Teacher, School, and Society&#8221; I would know better.</p>
<p>In his class, students are taught that &#8220;many African Americans speak and use a form of English that is somewhat different from Standard English.&#8221; They also learn that &#8220;the rules of Black American English are functional to those who use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maurice believes that if we wish to succeed in our &#8220;No child left behind&#8221; efforts we can begin by &#8220;trying to understand the language spoken by African American children.&#8221; Maurice cautions that &#8220;not all 36 million African Americans choose to speak Black English, especially the educated middle and upper income blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maurice devotes dozens of pages of class notes to teaching white future teachers the specifics of Black English. It isn&rsquo;t rocket science but it&rsquo;s darned close. For example, Maurice teaches his students that while whites use terms like &#8220;This, that, them, these, and those&#8221; blacks often say &#8220;Dis, dat, dem, dese, and dose.&#8221; His notes say &#8220;There is a &#8216;duh&rsquo; sound substituted for the &#8216;th&rsquo; sound in the beginning of the word.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, if a white teacher is going to teach black kids, she needs to learn how to curse like they do. Here, Professor Martinez is brilliant. He informs us that while whites use the terms &#8220;mother&#8221; and &#8220;brother,&#8221; blacks often prefer to say &#8220;muvah&#8221; and &#8220;bruvah.&#8221; Maurice even gives a sample sentence: &#8220;My muvah cook grits.&#8221; But he cautions that when using profanity in conjunction with the &#8220;F-word&#8221; it is best to pronounce &#8220;mother&#8221; properly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maurice, the tenured education professor, also informs students that when using plurals it is not necessary to add an &#8220;s&#8221; in Black English. That&rsquo;s why a paper costs &#8220;50 cent,&#8221; not &#8220;50 cents.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But Maurice cautions that &#8220;library&#8221; is a white way of saying things. Blacks say &#8220;liberry&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, those who speak Black English.</p>
<p>I already knew many words in Black English before I perused Professor Martinez&rsquo; class notes. For example, I knew &#8220;before&#8221; was &#8220;fo&#8221; and &#8220;fifty&#8221; was &#8220;fitty.&#8221; But I have to admit that I never knew that &#8220;corner&#8221; was &#8220;cornda.&#8221; Now I can say &#8220;Look at that ho on the cornda. I never seen that ho &#8216;fo.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But not everything that seems like a clue to a fight really is a clue to a fight. For example, &#8220;yeah, he packin&rsquo;&#8221; would seem to mean &#8220;he has a gun.&#8221; But in Black English, according to Professor Martinez&rsquo; notes, it could just mean &#8220;yes, he&rsquo;s well endowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>When white students are done with their homework, Professor Martinez may decide to ask them &#8220;Did you do your homework?&#8221; In response, he has taught them the correct Black English answer: &#8220;Teacher, I been done did dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>After sending their kids to study education at UNC-Wilmington, many parents may decide they want their tuition money back. Thankfully, Maurice teaches 18 ways to say &#8220;money&#8221; in Black English: Book, bread, cake, cash, cheddar, cheese, chump change, coins, crumbs, dough, eagle, fitty, green, jingle, loot, moola, scrilla, and Benjamin.</p>

		<p>That blacks pronounce various letters, sounds and phonetics in different ways is something I don&rsquo;t lose sleep over, b/c the long and short (no pun&rsquo; int&rsquo;d) of it is that some races and sub-racial ethnicities of people cannot make certain sounds that others can, mainly because of genetic and evolutionary factors.  </p>
<p>Also, some of this is a matter of idiom.</p>
<p>However, most of these apologetics for Ebonics have nothing to do with that.  Mr. Martinez is excusing bag grammar because of racial pandering and posturing.</p>

		<p>It is very easy to make fun of black English.  However, there is nothing inferior about black English.  Every language is a collection of dialects.  A &#8220;standard&#8221; language has been described as a dialect with an army.  In other words, the language as spoken by the politically dominant group is considered to be the &#8220;correct&#8221; way to speak the language.</p>
<p>Languages constantly change and what at one time is considered an incorrect usage or pronunciation becomes acceptible.</p>
<p>For example, few people now say &#8220;I will.&#8221;  &#8220;I am going to&#8221; is now the common way to express the future tense.  And no one actually says &#8220;I am going to.&#8221;  Listen, and you will hear &#8220;I&rsquo;m gunna&#8221; or &#8220;Ah moan&#8221; or &#8220;I&rsquo;m goan&#8221; or &#8220;I&rsquo;m in a.&#8221;  (For this last example say it very fast and put the accent on the &#8220;I&rsquo;m.&#8221;)  This is an evolution I have observed in my own lifetime.</p>
<p>What authority decreed that &#8220;mother&#8221; can&rsquo;t be &#8220;muhva&#8221;?  I don&rsquo;t say &#8220;mother&#8221; myself.  I say &#8220;mutha&#8221; the way Winston Churchill did and Queen Elizabeth does.  </p>
<p>And yes, black English does have its grammatical rules.  Every language and every dialect does.  Saying that one form of speaking English is correct and another is incorrect is a political statement, not a linguistic one.</p>

		<p>Actually, &#8220;black (African American) English&#8221; is inferior to standard English. This is true of the informal, or familar, forms of many languages.  In Sweden, we have the Swedish that we speak with our friends and family, but we would never use that form in school, or in court, with our doctors, and not even when speaking with stangers.  The same is true for all Germanic languages spoken in Europe, including, of course, English. Even London Cockneys know how and when to speak the Queen&rsquo;s English.  Swedish teachers and students would never use the &#8220;familiar&#8221; with one another, and this is how our children learn proper Swedish for use in appropriate situations. I cannot see a reason why White people should learn black English to use in school. The students are supposed to do the learning; let the students learn standard English in school, even though to speak in their dialect outside of school is fine. </p>

		<p>Growing up in NYC I often spoke improper English (&#8220;Dat guy ain&rsquo;t got nuttin&rsquo; to say!&#8221;). However, were I a schoolteacher I would teach the children correct grammar, not street slang.</p>
<p>Mr. Martinez seems to think it would be racist and disrespectful to blacks to criticize Ebonics.</p>

		<p>The professor seems to have pronunciation and slang confused. Ebonics or whatever it is called closely resembles dialects heard in both Black and White speakers in the American South. I knew a White guy from the mountains of North Carolina who spoke just like a Black speaking Ebonics. He was sometimes difficult  for me to understand (but not for his Black coworkers) because of the way he pronounced or slurred many words, not because of the words he used. (He pronounced shrimp &#8220;scrumps&#8221; and bedroom &#8220;baitrawm.&#8221;)The examples that professor gives are right out of Minstrel Show talk, and not at all esoteric to White folks. In the Mid Atlantic, saying &#8220;liberry&#8221; for library is not uncommon for Whites, especially White kids. However, by the end of this article, he makes reference to slang, which in the Black community can change from week to week, go away for a while, and return again months or even years later. You can&rsquo;t learn this in a classroom. </p>

		<p>GB, are you serious?</p>
<p>Ebonics is street slang, nothing more and nothing less.  While all groups and generations have their own slang and while language does evolve over time, there is a mutually used &#8216;standard&rsquo; English that allows us all to communicate with each other.  In fact I would argue that the differences between the various English dialects is decreasing due to mass communication.  College educated white and Hispanic people can use slang in casual conversation but use standard English at work or in more formal situations.  And that is the difference between blacks and just about everyone else.</p>
<p>I work in a largely black environment with a significant foreign-born Hispanic component.  The educated Hispanics, despite flaws in their spoken English, will generally produce written reports that are grammatically correct.  They keep dictionaries and usage books at their desks.  They take a certain pride in their work.  Blacks, despite a college degree, frequently write exactly the way they speak.  A simple declarative sentence is beyond many of them.  I have had to actually &#8220;translate&#8221; black speech for my Hispanic colleagues.  One actually said, after a certain employee was out of ear shot, &#8220;I may speak with an accent but I don&rsquo;t hear with an accent and I don&rsquo;t care what you say, that woman is not speaking English&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the new world order speaking intelligible English is more and more a necessity.  Trying to make people think Ebonics is a true dialect is both foolish and hurtful to Blacks and their prospects for a better life.<br>

		<p>I got my first dose of ebonics after entering the public school system a few years back.  It sounds funny to hear and sometimes it can be quite funny.  With that said, training white teachers to speak ebonics to better educate the kids is an interesting concept.  Then the ebonics speakers will have ebonics outside of school and ebonics inside of school.  When will they learn the standard form of English that Latinos and Asians are trying so hard to perfect?  </p>
<p>We already know that whites generally do not hire ebonics speakers (unless the speaker can &#8216;turn it off&rsquo; while at work).  Will Asians or Latinos hire blacks who speak ebonics?  Given that Latinos will be the majority here in a few decades, shouldn&rsquo;t the ebonics people learn proper English - oh, wait a minute - blacks should be learning Spanish, even as many of us whites have been forced to do.</p>
<p>I wonder what an ebonics accent sounds like in Spanish?</p>

		<p>Black English is a substandard dialect of a substandard people.  There is no literature, technical achievements, or philosophy expressed in black English. Black English enables the speaker to communicate only with other denizens of inner cities, and limits their lives to those hell holes.  Saying that black English and Standard English both have rules is no different than saying both are spoken with the lips and tongue, and therefore equivalent. I would surmise that upon careful analysis black English would be found to be more fluid and less rule following than standard English,(given that it has no written culture to bind it or allow it to grow), and is probably barely above a pidgin language.  Thomas Sowell once wrote an article, or maybe it was part of a book, tracing black English back to the poor and illiterate of the 17th century English countryside.  Those Whites certainly managed to improve their lot in the new world.  Are there any college professors advocating illiterate Whites retain their uneducated ways?  Walter Williams recently wrote a column blaming black English for limiting the opportunities for blacks.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine translating a scientific paper or poem or play from English to French, but can you imagine translating one from English to black English?  </p>
<p>Non black, non native English speakers manage to master standard English, and their children tend not even to have accents.  Millions of blacks have, in fact, also improved themselves and speak standard English.  They are disdained by the black masses.  I believe that the persistence of black English is one piece of major evidence that those blacks who are able to be civilized already are, and those left behind have neither the ability nor the desire to improve their lot.</p>

I had an experience with black English the other day.</p>
<p>I left work and was standing at the bus stop.</p>
<p>I heard someone calling out. It was a black guy about half a block away. (Blacks apparently like to get your attention when they get within shouting range).</p>
<p>He came up to me and asked me a question. &#8220;Where da jibber-jabber at?&#8221; (Jibber-jabber stands for the word I couldn&rsquo;t understand).</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said it louder. &#8220;Where da jibber-jabber at?!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, I said I didn&rsquo;t know what he was saying.</p>
<p>He got louder and angrier. &#8220;WHERE DA JIBBER-JABBER AT!? You standing here an you don&rsquo;t know where da gibber-gabber at?&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked away cursing.</p>
<p>I had NO IDEA what he was asking. It sounded something like &#8216;mc cartny&rsquo; but I couldn&rsquo;t make it out no matter how many times he said it.<br>

		<p>Svenska is right.  I live near a large Amish community where those people speak to each other in German that is considered high German, but not at all formal.  Their Swiss Bible is written in very formal high German and they call it God&rsquo;s language. </p>

		<p>When are we simply going to call black English bad English? Apologists can rationalize such a substandard dialect all they want. They can talk about &#8220;different languages and different norms,&#8221; &#8220;unique dialects,&#8221; and what have you. However, you can&rsquo;t obtain a good job with that kind of garbage coming out of your mouth. I have no problem with blacks speaking ebonics around one another (though listening to them speak is painful nonetheless). When a black person is around me, however, I expect him/her to speak standard English (or &#8220;code switch&#8221;). There are many poor whites from the South who speak in a similar fashion. However, white professors are not defending such dialect and insisting that it be taught in schools. Generally, we whites don&rsquo;t defend our trash the way blacks do. </p>

		<p>GB - I don&rsquo;t know where to begin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge difference between a language evolving naturally and a language degenerating because its speakers never read and simply cannot be bothered to communicate with any precision. There are many ways, for instance, of speaking about the future. &ldquo;I will&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am going to&rdquo; are, in fact, quite different, as is the use of the present progressive tense to speak about future plans. All three are still in regular use.</p>
<p>Feel free to pursue this relativistic nonsense if you wish. If you have children, I hope they don&rsquo;t find themselves in competition with people who speak well – often from countries where English is a second language and precise communication is still valued.</p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m not entirely sure. But there are interesting similarities. For instance, in the Caribbean dialect (as with Dominicans) the plural is not formed.  There is no distinction made between singular and plural, in spoken form.   &#8220;Dos pesos&#8221; (two dollars) though written as such,  becomes &#8220;do peso&#8221; when spoken.    Tres hombres  (three men), becomes &#8220;tre hombre&#8221;.  Many endings of other words are not pronounced.  This can lead to confusion and imprecision.  It is simply sloppy speech, that&rsquo;s all, not an equal dialect with equal merit.  </p>

		<p>The mangling of the English language is the perfect complement to the black contrarian fashion statements such as wearing one&rsquo;s hat backward; wearing pants several sizes too large with the crotch pulled down to the knees and wearing grossly oversized hooded sweatshirts regardless of the outside temperature.  </p>

<p>What is being called black English is nothing more than lazy speech combined with bizarre twists thrown in to make it &#8216;cultural&rsquo; (in other words blacks only). It&rsquo;s nothing more than dropping syllables and suffixes, such as &#8216;es&rsquo; or &#8216;s&rsquo;, &#8216;ing&rsquo; &amp; combining letter groupings and choosing to make a letter sound different simply because it&rsquo;s easier to say.

		<p>To put GB&rsquo;s idiotic liberalisms to rest (RIP) just think of the 1970&rsquo;s movie, &#8220;Airplane.&rsquo; In it, Barbara Billingsley (the Mother on &#8216;Leave it to Beaver&rsquo;) raises her hand, when two &#8216;African-Americans&rsquo; are speaking &#8216;jive.&rsquo; The stewardess asks for a translator, &#8216;Does anyone here speak &#8216;jive.?&#8221; Billingsley then launches into a PERFECT example of &#8220;Ebonics&rsquo; (before it even had that name) that just brings tears to a White man&rsquo;s eyes, in talking to these two Black &#8216;SPORTS FIGURES&rsquo;. Stereotyping at its&rsquo; finest, and a joy to behold&hellip;.</p>
<p>THAT is how STUPID giving ANY legitimacy to &#8220;Black English&#8221; is. And we could joke about it, 40 years ago. Now, it&rsquo;s a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; to even say that BE is &#8216;substandard.&rsquo; (which it is) Why am I reminded of the tribunal Galileo underwent &#8220;Eppure, si muove&#8221;) in reading about Martinez&rsquo; goosestep Political Correctness?  Nah, just mere coincidence&hellip; righttt.</p>

		<p>Looks like GB at #3 took Linguistics 101. What&rsquo;s infuriating is taking a graduate seminar in it where some tenured professor goes into the concept of &#8220;genre awareness&#8221; and &#8220;discourse communities&#8221; and the way language is used by da man ta keep da bruddas down. It makes me glad my state is broke and these wiseacres are likely going to lose their jobs in the bye and bye.</p>
<p>The fact is, that particular dialect  &mdash;  though not intrinsically inferior in and of itself  &mdash;  is associated with impulsive, violence-prone, semi-literate losers. Speak it if you want to, but be ready to live with the consequences.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s even worse when one has to deal with an ebonics-speaking affirmative action customer service hire over the telephone; frequently there is simply no way to get coherent information or instructions out of them.  If there is anything &#8220;good&#8221; about the offshoring of many of these jobs, iot is that Indian-accented English is considerably easier to understand.</p>

		<p>To Shawn (the female): Much as I agree with the spirit of your post, I think that there is more to black speech other than pure laziness. Some examples:</p>
<p>&#8220;I done been&hellip;&#8221; is not shorter nor easier to say than &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s git up out dis muhf***a&#8221; is not shorter nor easier to say than &#8220;Let&rsquo;s get out of here&#8221;</p>
<p>and so on.  I think forces are at play other than mere abbreviation. I&rsquo;ve often wondered about black difficulty in pronouncing the word &#8220;ask&#8221;, particularly as many Italians pronounce the word &#8220;desktop&#8221; as &#8220;dextop&#8221;.  Maybe the correct pronunciation really is more taxing on the speech apparatus.  </p>

		<p>Danger! People who speak variants of a language often  become annoyed at those who try to immitate them. I have observed this in many instances. For example, in my high school there was a guy who stuttered, an easy way to infuriate him (not a good idea) was to stutter when talking to him. Other guys and gals who spoke with non-local accents or dialects were also bothered by having their speech immitated, which they considered mockery. </p>
<p>Most Blacks have good language capability and can understand White English with ease. It may be useful to be able to understand what Blacks are saying, but unless you want to pick a fight, speak in White English to them. </p>

		<p>I expected the outcry.  No I am not a liberal.  I have a keen interest in language.  </p>
<p>The comment by Svenska confirms my point, I think.  The issues are social, not linquistic.  The Queen&rsquo;s English is the Queen&rsquo;s English precisely because she has the army, so to speak.  Pennsylvania 6-5000 confirms my point.  The Amish consider one way of speaking to be God&rsquo;s language.  This is very common.  Catholics do (or did) have the same view of Latin.  Iranian Moslems speak an Aryan language but use Arabic for some religious purposes.  The some Orthodox churches also have a liturgical language -Old Church Slavonic.     </p>
<p>Istvan, &#8220;Ebonics&#8221; is far more than slang.</p>
<p>Flamethrower, by what measure do you determine that a dialect is &#8220;substandard&#8221;?  Yes, there is no body of literature in black English, but that does not mean that the dialect is somehow inferior.  There was no literature in Italian until Dante started writing in the vernacular instead of Latin.  Is Italian a substandard dialect of Latin?  Is Robert Burns&rsquo; poetry written in a substandard dialect?  </p>
<p>White person:  I would bet my bottom dollar that you say things every day that some would consider &#8220;bad&#8221; English.  Do you split infinitives?  Or say &#8220;their&#8221; instead of &#8220;his&#8221; when the gender is not know?  Do you ever say &#8220;with John and I&#8221; instead of &#8220;with John and me&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Barry: I defy you to draw a meaningful distinction between evolving and degenerating.  Look at all the English words that have unpronounced letters.  These sounds once were spoken.  When they were dropped over time did language evolve or did it degenerate?</p>
<p>Shawn: words you and I say every day have dropped syllables.  We just don&rsquo;t notice because they were dropped before you and I were born.  </p>
<p>jewamongyou: you hit the nail on the head.  Southern American English is considered substandard by ignorant, arrogant Yankees.  <br>

Ha!  Yes, all the fashionable empathizing and political correctness are glaringly apparent.  I did like his comment about  &#8220;a language being a dialect with an army behind it,&#8221; though.  Clever and true, but that is an over-simplification, of course.  There&rsquo;s truth in it, yes, but it&rsquo;s much more than that.  What&rsquo;s left out is that a standard language also has universities, scholars,  great writers, a body of great literature, magazines and many other publications, and a long literary history behind it.  It probably has a formal language academy also where its rules are studied and codified.  It is not the transitory street lingo that a 15 year-old ghetto rapper is speaking this month.<br>

<p>Really???   Well, I am American, and I don&rsquo;t know ANYBODY who speaks that way!  Certainly, I don&rsquo;t.  (My mother, a would-have-been great actress,  was a stickler for precise grammar and pronunciation; and she wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate sloppy speech in her house.)</p>
<p>Nor do I know anybody (in family or close friends) who exhibits the grammatical errors that you mention in #27. One does occasionally hear such people being interviewed on TV, though.</p>
<p>But I will concede that Schoolteacher was right about Bantu, Sioux, etc. Even Friesian and Albanian.  Yes, they are languages.   (Well, Friesian, like Dutch, might be considered a &#8220;Low German dialect&#8221;   &mdash;   even though the Dutch wouldn&rsquo;t like that.  Precisely, even English is categorized as such.)  What I had in mind when making my comment was the standard &#8220;great&#8221; European languages. I&rsquo;ll concede that there are exceptions, especially so in pre-literate Third World cultures. <br>
As for the blacks living in America, they are a Third World population living among us, not part of us. I do think we can agree on that much.</p>

Martinez sure wouldve been proud of the way he spoke. I on the other hand often found myself staring at him, mouth agape, desperately trying to decipher what this creature was hooting and hollering about. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t wanna offend any of you commi leftists out there, but how can someone who has reached the age of nineteen and not complete a lucid sentence be accepted into college? I was under the belief that colleges only accepted the brightest and most hard working kids around? Oh wait, thats only if your white! I cant believe I forgot.

Yes indeed.  The glottal stop exists in the English language, in some dialects more than others, but we have no letter for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh oh&#8221; is the most common example.  Another is Hawai&rsquo;i, the way they say it there.  We hear it also in mountain, Clinton, fountain, but we don&rsquo;t realize it.  Just sat the words the way you do in ordinary conversation and you will hear it.  This sound is far more prevalent in British dialects than in American dialects.    </p>
<p>This sort of change is happening all the time in all languages. It is a natural process.  </p>
