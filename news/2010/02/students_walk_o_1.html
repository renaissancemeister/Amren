<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ucsd25-2010feb25,0,4256213.story">Students Walk out of UC San Diego Teach-In</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 1,200 students, faculty and staff packed an auditorium in the student center for the teach-in, which campus administrators organized in response to the incidents, including an off-campus party Feb. 15 that mocked Black History Month.</p>
<p>But halfway through the planned two-hour session, hundreds of students walked out.</p>
<p>The students, who were joined by many others during the afternoon, held their own noisy but peaceful rally outside the building, calling on UC San Diego leaders to improve conditions for minority students and boost their numbers.</p>
<p>Administrators may have thought the teach-in &#8220;would make us quiet,&#8221; said Fnann Keflezighi, vice chairwoman of the Black Student Union. But she said minority students do not believe that the university will take significant steps to improve the situation. The controversial party, she and others contended, was just the spark that ignited long-simmering ethnic tensions on the campus.</p>
<p>According to UC systemwide data, UC San Diego enrolled the smallest number of black freshmen last fall of any of the nine undergraduate campuses, 46 students out of a class of 3,749. Overall, officials say, about 1.6% of the campus&rsquo; 23,143 undergraduates are African American, among the lowest percentages in the UC system.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, many students wore black and white T-shirts  &mdash;  &#8220;Real Pain, Real Action, 1.3%&#8221;  &mdash;  that noted the low enrollment figures, although with a slightly different calculation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox, who has condemned the off-campus &#8220;Compton Cookout,&#8221; attended the teach-in but did not speak publicly. Administrators have said the campus is taking many steps within the law to boost recruitment of African American students and to provide more counseling and security on campus.</p>
<p>The university is also investigating whether it can discipline the organizers of the party, which promised guests a taste of &#8220;life in the ghetto.&#8221;</p>
<p>The negative depiction of Compton has also upset residents of that city. To help counter those images, three teachers from Compton High School traveled to San Diego on Wednesday and presented a statement from their students.</p>
<p>The statement, read by a Compton High graduate who is now a UCSD student, said that Latinos constitute 65% of Compton&rsquo;s population and that Latinos were also offended by the party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas Horne, an English teacher at Compton High, said students there who recently applied to UC campuses are now undecided about whether to attend UC San Diego. Some may be scared off by recent events, but others may be motivated to help boost the ranks of minority students there. {snip}</p>
<p>Several days after the La Jolla party, racial tensions rose again when a campus satire group voiced support for the party and used a racial slur on a student television show.</p>
<p>The student-run station has been temporarily suspended, as has student government funding for some other publications.</p>
<p>About 300 students held a rally before Wednesday&rsquo;s teach-in, at which David Ritcherson, Black Student Union chairman, declared &#8220;a state of emergency to address the hostile and toxic environment on campus.&#8221; He demanded that administrators increase funding for minority student recruitment and academic support beyond what Fox promised and said students who are in the first generation of their families to attend college should be given some preferences in admissions decisions.</p>
<p>But some had a different view.</p>
<p>Inez Feltscher, a UCSD student who heads the campus College Republicans club and participated in the teach-in, said she deplored the racially themed party but worried that the subsequent protests could deepen racial separation on the campus.</p>

		<p>Weren&rsquo;t all campuses(including Berkeley) forced to stop admitting students based on race?</p>
<p>Funny how whenever colleges are forced to admit based on merit blacks suddenly stop gaining entry.  I&rsquo;m sure that has nothing at all to do with their lower average IQ.  Must be white racism, or that mythical white privilege surely.<br>

<p>So Blacks want more Blacks on campus. But Blacks are something like 12% of the entire US population. So even if they get affirmative action and the like, there&rsquo;s obviously a certain limit to the number in which they can be present in American universities. </p>

		<p>Wow, When I heard about the party I thought is was quite funny, but stupid for thinking they&rsquo;d get away with it. The party wasn&rsquo;t making fun of a people as it was a &#8220;culture&#8221; where even many young white men act &#8220;ghetto&#8221; like Kevin Federline ect. </p>
<p>Well, here it is, I&rsquo;m amazed but not surprised how far the &#8220;minorities&#8221; are taking this. They love nothing more than whining about every little slight, &#8220;the squeaky wheel gets the oil.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Perhaps they should complain to the heads of the Historically black colleges in the nation, as well as to those of the majority black colleges, when they make their plea for greater enrollment in San Diego. Perhaps to the government and corporation in California too. Is there a one that doesn&rsquo;t have an aggressive recruiting campaign to hire as many of them any way possible, with generous preferences for them over whites?</p>

		<p>Who cares what these blacks do?  Let them scream, let them threaten.  Most of them will flunk out in the first year anyway.  I hope that the administrators of this school that have been screamed at by black teenagers are leftists like most in academia.  Let them stew in the diversity they so love.</p>

		<p>Upon reading the headline I hoped it was the white students who funally got a bell full and left. Too much to ask for, but I suppose those who skipped the teach-in may hold such views. Still there remains no politically organized counter force. Inez Feltscher, President of the college Republicons, worries about &#8220;racial separation.&#8221; She makes me cringe, she might as well join the Tiger Woods fan club.</p>

		<p>Maybe these black students should go to college in Africa where there is no institutional racism and no crazy white parties.  If they do go, I just hope that the Tutsi&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t mistake them for Hutu&rsquo;s.  Otherwise things could get ugly very quickly.</p>

		<p>I am familiar with both Compton and San Diego/La Jolla (that&rsquo;s pronounced &#8220;La Hoya&#8221; for those of you virgins-in-Spanish), and, what the satire is saying is TRUE.  Compton was once a middle class white area, but blacks started moving in and white flight happened.  Then Compton was pretty much all black and started to spread to N. Long Beach.  There was blue collar work available in the oil fields and shipyards down there.  Today a white person would have to be just plain ignorant to drive into Compton OR North Long Beach - it isn&rsquo;t safe even for blacks, much less for anybody not-black.  It is a hole, a ghetto   &mdash;   and if the poor sensitive little Af-Am students at San Diego can&rsquo;t handle a look at the truth, then maybe they could stop their generally obnoxious BEHAVIOR (which is the crux of the problem), start getting academically proficient, and pull their ghettos up by their own bootstraps.  After all, Compton was a decent place to live until the blacks took it over!!!</p>

		<p>List what majors the blacks already there are in.  I bet they are not in Chemical Engineering or Physics or Material Science or Mathmatics&hellip;. maybe a black female in Civil Engineering.  A lot in &#8220;pre-law&hellip;.&#8221;, education. sociology, of course Black Studies, Women&rsquo;s Studies, etc.  All the areas with minimal demands on grey matter and as a result no jobs upon graduation.  What one of them is going to study diffusion processes and work on thin film deposition in wafer fabrication.  What one will write a brief argueing a defense if election of remedies or respondeat superior to establish  liability.  Give me break.  They&rsquo;ll go work for Acorn.</p>

		<p>QUOTE: &#8220;Many of those involved said the protest showed how difficult it will be for the beachside campus to overcome long-standing concerns about the small number of African American students enrolled there.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>COMMENT: Honestly, who&rsquo;s concerned? I&rsquo;m not concerned there aren&rsquo;t enough whites at Morehouse. The tone of the article is such that all of the southwestern United States has been preoccupied with this issue for years. </p>
<p>============</p>
<p>QUOTE: &#8220;The students, who were joined by many others during the afternoon, held their own noisy but peaceful rally outside the building, calling on UC San Diego leaders to improve conditions for minority students and boost their numbers.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>COMMENT: First, as anyone who has even a passing understanding of college-age students knows, many will join a &#8220;protest&#8221; without having any idea what they are protesting or advocating, but it is somehow a rite of passage (thank some of the Baby Boomers for that). Also, the phrase &#8220;improve conditions&#8221; sounds like blacks on campus were forced to live in Haiti-like squalor.  </p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>QUOTE: &#8220;The teach-in moderator, Mentha Hynes-Wilson, an African American who is dean of students at UCSD&rsquo;s Thurgood Marshall College, went forward with the session for several hundred people who remained in the room after the walkout. Hynes-Wilson said she was not offended by the disruption. &#8216;That&rsquo;s what they needed to do, and we need to honor that,&rsquo; she said.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>COMMENT: Yes, honor the disruption. Quite a dean UCSD has there - what a disgrace.</p>
<p>============</p>
<p>QUOTE: &#8220;The university is also investigating whether it can discipline the organizers of the party, which promised guests a taste of life in the ghetto.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>COMMENT: It&rsquo;s like the Gestapo - they are basically saying the school is frantically looking for any trumped-up charge that will stick. </p>
<p>================</p>
<p>QUOTE: &#8220;The negative depiction of Compton has also upset residents of that city.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>COMMENT: A brilliant line - what more needs to be said?  How dare anyone actually tell the truth.</p>
<p>===============</p>
<p>QUOTE: &#8220;Several days after the La Jolla party, racial tensions rose again when a campus satire group voiced support for the party and used a racial slur on a student television show. The student-run station has been temporarily suspended, as has student government funding for some other publications.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: Welcome to North Korea.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p><br>
QUOTE: &#8220;About 300 students held a rally before Wednesday&rsquo;s teach-in, at which David Ritcherson, Black Student Union chairman, declared &#8216;a state of emergency to address the hostile and toxic environment on campus.&rsquo; He demanded that administrators increase funding for minority student recruitment and academic support beyond what Fox promised and said students who are in the first generation of their families to attend college should be given some preferences in admissions decisions.&#8221;  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>COMMENT: This would be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so sickening. For some reason, this student now has powers to &#8220;declare&#8221; and &#8220;demand&#8221; and request the usual change in admissions standards - meaning lowering the standards.</p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>Two final points. First, it is apparent to everyone - no matter who they are - that the reason there are so few blacks at UCSD is because they simply could not compete academically in terms of admission against whites. </p>
<p>Sorry, but that&rsquo;s the way it goes. The school is better for it and again, this, too, is apparent to everyone, even if left unsaid. </p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;m convinced these things always backfire. The liberal administrators and leftist academics and &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; faculty and students - who in reality hardly ever mix with blacks - now will have the opportunity to get some real face time with a group of illogical, pushy, and not very bight African-Americans. It will only take a few days but this will plant the seed of racial realism in many.</p>

		<p>Government, public universities are going to go the way of public schools - endless integration, lowering of standards, rising violence and basically, well, zimbabwe.  You have seen this decline in recnt years.  The social justice crowd thinks that colleges also have an &#8216;obligation&rsquo; to lift minorites and underachievers.  That&rsquo;s a far cry from what colleges used to be for - educating the best and brightest regardless of class.  Now we have to bring in underachievers to uplift them.  So it&rsquo;s all remedial and such.</p>
<p>I say give em what they want.  Flood the colleges with as many minorities as want to get in.  This is how we need to operate.  Don&rsquo;t oppose A/A in public institutions, it is a losing game and makes us stressed for no reason.  Give em all the affirmative action they want.  Hire nothing but black professors and admins.  Whites and other smart civilized people will pay for private colleges, and employers will know who to hire when it comes down to the bottom line.</p>
<p>If employers are pressed to do A/A hiring, then the most successful businesses will be the ones that keep it most at bay with skill and flair, while appearing to comply.  They can set up special &#8216;units&rsquo; of the company filled with the minorites in which their activities are not critical.</p>

		<p>The university should have no control over what students do off campus unless it&rsquo;s done officially in its name.  And, of course, there would be no scholastic objection to a white trash party or hillbilly-themed hoedown!  <br>
As for the hundreds of students who walked out of the teach-in, I wonder how many were Hispanics and whites who were bored with the whole deal.  The paper makes it sound like they all joined a rally, but that&rsquo;s seriously doubtful.  <br>
Blacks will never have any chance of fitting in where they constantly insist on special treatment.</p>

		<p>The UC system in California has twisted itself into knots to get around Prop 209 which prohibits race-based admissions.  To circumvent 209, UCs use something it calls &#8216;comprehensive review&rsquo; to grand admission which weighs such stupid things as &#8216;life experiences&rsquo;, downplays standardized test scores, and gives more weight to high school class rank.  The UC Board of Regents voted to eliminate the requirement for applicants to take two SAT subject tests (which Asians believe, and rightly so, was done to reduce their numbers).  </p>
<p>Black/hispanic graduation rates?  Who cares, and this, of course, is never mentioned in the msm or academia, as that would be racist. </p>
<p>But, according to Wiki (and kudos for Wiki for this):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since the passage of Proposition 209, higher graduation rates have been posted at University of California schools &hellip;The African American graduation&hellip; rose dramatically, from 26 percent to 52 percent, at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>While African American graduation rates at UC Berkeley increased by 6.5 percent, the enrollment rates dropped significantly&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As the mother of a beautiful 18-year old UC Berkeley freshman, this is good news.</p>
<p>So, as usual, blacks want everything dumbed down for them, even though without 209&rsquo;s vetting their graduation rate at UCSD is 26%  &mdash;  which I&rsquo;m sure they blame on White Racism and Bigotry, not their own shortcomings.</p>
<p>Would it not be better for blacks to attend colleges that matched their abilities rather than be allowed to enter a UC which is far above their capabilities?</p>
<p>Asians, who have the most to lose in the UC admissions game, are not standing by quietly  &mdash;  as they are allowed, unlike Whites, to band together and form race-specific advocacy groups:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Asian organizations are angry about the changes, which will negatively affect students of Asian decent applying to UC. They contend that subject tests are a better indicator of college readiness than the SAT I&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Let the lawsuits begin.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks protest the violence in their community?  Why don&rsquo;t they protest the black and white &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; hustlers that make a living keeping them mad at whites?  Why don&rsquo;t these same blacks show outrage towards black bigots?</p>

		<p>Just another case of blacks never acknowledging that they create a lot of their problems.  As usual, they don&rsquo;t seem to grasp the connection between actions and consequences.  If they bothered to develop an strong cultural emphasis on education and academic achievement like Asians and Jews have, there would&rsquo;nt be problems with them attending higher tier schools. But anything that involves taking responsibility and then working hard are out of their conceptual frameworks.  I certainly see this situation all of the time at the community college I attend.  Most of the American blacks there expect to be spoon-fed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks are 14% of the US population&#8221; </p>
<p>This figure is not even close to accurate.</p>
<p>Blacks hate and despise anything &ldquo;White&rdquo; Including the US census. <br>
The fact that &ldquo;being counted&rdquo; increases your representation as far as Governments go is lost on blacks, they don&rsquo;t care, as long as the Governments keep giving them money they are happy, they just don&rsquo;t want to be counted. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;White Thang&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blacks make other blacks, that&rsquo;s what they do and have always done and they do it well. They cant take care of their offspring, never have and never will. We Whites will have to do it, always have, they have come to expect it. I say equal rights should come with equal responsibility, not going to happen. </p>
<p>My best guess based on living in America is blacks represent closer to 25% of the US population, maybe more. We will never know for sure. Take a walk, go shopping, cruise around the neighborhood, 14%? I don&rsquo;t think so.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The statement, read by a Compton High graduate who is now a UCSD student, said that Latinos constitute 65% of Compton&rsquo;s population and that Latinos were also offended by the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks are being driven out of Compton by Latinos.  So much for non-white race relations.</p>

		<p>Some of the smartest young blacks seem to be stuck back in the civil rights era: somehow it has escaped them that equality is here, and opportunities can be grabbed with both hands by just getting an education or starting a business. Instead, they think that the only respectable occupation is to be an activist a la MLK or Nelson Mandela&hellip; <br>
The problems in the black community are enormous, and they can no longer be blamed on white prejudice  &mdash;  blacks must themselves acknowledge that they have not escaped slavery  &mdash;  they still think it is ennobling to shun work, to steal, to trick the white man whenever they can. A true leader of the black community would not constantly clamor for more special privileges  &mdash;  a true leader would demand that blacks acknowledge that they are already privileged to live in this great country, and that they must accept the responsibilities that such a privilege brings.</p>
