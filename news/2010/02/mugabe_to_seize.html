<h1>Mugabe to Seize White Businesses for Blacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peta Thornycroft and Sebastien Berger, Telegraph (London), February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White-owned companies in Zimbabwe will be forced to hand control to black businessmen under laws reminiscent of those that led to the seizure of the nation&rsquo;s farms.</p>
<p>The regulations demand that companies, including foreign firms, hand over at least 51 per cent of ownership to &#8220;indigenous&#8221; Zimbabweans.</p>
<p>Thousands of businesses, including the operations of Barclays bank, Standard Chartered bank and mining company Rio Tinto, will be affected. They must submit their plans to comply by March 1. Owners who fail to comply will face jail sentences.</p>
<p>The regulations were passed by President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s Zanu-PF party before the 2008 election in which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change won control of the legislature.</p>
<p>The rules were put on hold until supplementary regulations were drawn up by the government, which quietly published them last week.</p>
<p>While companies have five years to comply, the effects will be felt long before then.</p>
<p>Indigenous Zimbabweans are defined as anyone who was &#8220;disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race and any descendant of such person&#8221; before independence in 1980.</p>
<p>It means white Zimbabweans are excluded, and the position of Zimbabwean Asians is open to question.</p>
<p>Whites are barred from some sectors altogether, including agriculture, retail and transport, as well as barbers and beauty parlours. Harare&rsquo;s business community was left in shock by the development. One banker said: &#8220;This is absolute madness.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fuel trader said: &#8220;These regulations are theft of any business in which whites have an interest; it&rsquo;s just like the farms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nick Cobban, a spokesman for Rio Tinto, described the regulations as &#8220;draconian and unworkable&#8221;. The company operates a diamond mine in Zimbabwe that it considers has potential for expansion but has not developed &#8220;partly because of the uncertainty&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alistair Smith, director of media relations for Barclays Group, said the firm was &#8220;considering the implications&#8221;.</p>
<p>Daniel Ndlela, an eminent regional economist said: &#8220;There will be no foreign investment into Zimbabwe. Why would anyone come into Zimbabwe with $100 and be left with $49?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not clear exactly how the 51 per cent stake is supposed to be acquired.</p>
<p>The law has plunged Zimbabwe&rsquo;s coalition government into crisis. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change and prime minister, told The Daily Telegraph the move had been made without his knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were published without due process and in contravention of the global political agreement [which set up the coalition] and constitution of Zimbabwe and are therefore null and void,&#8221; he said.<br>

<p>Yes, and why shouldn&rsquo;t he?  I mean, it was blacks who built Rhodesia from scratch to an elegant first world civilization.  And they did it while whites were beating them, just as they did when blacks built the pyramids.</p>
<p>Blacks invented everything.  They designed and built everything, too.  The only reason they&rsquo;re not given credit for anything is because the white man covered up their achievements.</p>

		<p>For the most part, the only way either an individual African or a group of Africans (i.e.,  a neighborhood, city, or country) can hope to survive above a primitive level is to parasitize Whites.  As soon as all the Whites are gone, any African society or economy will quickly return to the African base-line (e.g., Haiti). </p>
<p>There is really nothing that we can do for these people, other than leave them alone to create a society to their liking. If we leave them alone, their population will correct, and they will quickly revert back to a simple, tribal existence, where they will be much happier.  Feeding them only increases their population, poverty and misery.  Helping African make more babies is the cruelest thing that we do.<br>

		<p>Besides the mineral miners, whose product can be exported in exchange for foreign currencies, what white person would continue to conduct business inside Zimbabwe, especially considering the collapsing currency and the physical danger? Something is missing here. And why in the hell would Barclays have a branch there???<br>

		<p>Fine, let them seize white-owned businesses&hellip;then let their starvation just increase further.  They&rsquo;ll end up just like Haiti, begging for whites to come save them.  There have been various stories over the years about the black populations of Zimbabwe and S. Africa talking about how things were better under white rule.  Let this point be reinforced.</p>

<p>So whites can&rsquo;t be farmers?  Well, they did steal the land from blacks so that might make some sense.  Even if it destroys the economy and causes mass starvation. </p>
<p>Now, why can&rsquo;t whites be shop keepers?  Or bus drivers?  Or barbers and hair dressers?  Where is the outrage from the international white community over this discrimination?  The best thing at this point is for all the whites to just leave Zimbabwe.  Unfortunately white countries won&rsquo;t take these poor souls in.  And that is the heart of the problem, whites do not help whites.  We slobber all over Haitians but will not lift a finger to help our own.  We are a dying race because we are a sick race.</p>
<p>This is also a prime example of black thinking.  They seem to think that everything that whites have just appeared by magic.  And if they just take the whites&rsquo; stuff they will be prosperous.  They do not understand the planning and work that goes into building and maintaining a modern society.  If blacks were even minimally intelligent they would allow whites to live among them in peace and just copy.  That is right, just copy the white folks and they could live like the white folks.  But even being a copy-cat is beyond their reasoning skills. </p>
<p>Beyond the most primitive level of survival blacks are only capable of stealing to &#8220;improve&#8221; their lot.  And even that they don&rsquo;t do well.</p>

		<p>As sad as it sounds, I believe this is true for Africa and for Haiti, as well. </p>
<p>We currently have an administration that is falling all over itself to help Third World countries to the detriment of our own citizens. But these problems aren&rsquo;t recent.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration, unfortunately put the brakes on family planning aid, favoring &#8220;abstinence&#8221; and moved away from providing contraceptive devices in developing countries, even to married women. The result was a boom in African population and HIV cases - just what they needed (sarcasm).</p>
<p>I believe we have to accept that we aren&rsquo;t going to change Africa, Haiti, and other poor countries - nor should we be involved in either &#8220;rescuing&#8221; or even doing business with them. Our country has enough problems of its own.<br>

<p>Whites won&rsquo;t consider helping their own.  African Whites probably couldn&rsquo;t even get refugee status in the West, but the red carpet is out for the Haitians.  Do Whites have some sort of genetic defect?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re so right. Where were these people when the White farmers were being forced off their land and/or raped, robbed, torchered and murdered. I&rsquo;m GLAD this is happening. These people passively sat back and said nothing [ and probably had a hand in it ] while their fellow Whites were being slaughtered. Did they honestly think that it couldn&rsquo;t happen to them? What&rsquo;s that saying - &#8220;when they came for so and so, I said nothing. Now they&rsquo;re coming for me.&#8221;    </p>

<p>And WHY should these remaining Whites think they should have or would have been treated any different than the White farmers? I have no compassion or sympathy for White businessmen who saw what was coming and what was happening to their fellow Whites, thinking Mugarbage would never do that to their businesses. The remaining Whites will be lucky to get out of the Zim with their lives. SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;..the banks and mine will leave and come back after the blacks have reduced their numbers through murders, emmigration or plain ole starving to death. Either one will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Agreed 100%. Does anyone one know of any group that publicizes the plight of white Zimbabweans and provides aid? I would be willing to donate to such a group, if it exists.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, why not? This seems like a natural topic for white advocacy - this is a straightforward, winning topic for white advocates to publicize and discuss. There are plenty of anti-white hate out there, but few so extreme as Zimbabwe today.</p>

		<p>Reneging on agreements is part of African culture  &mdash;  just like wife-beating. The whites of Rhodesia were too eager to end their war, and too eager to trust their black enemies. Too eager because the war isolated them from (overly PC) Europe and America. Are any of us in Europe and America saying &#8220;sorry&#8221; now? <br>
Might be worthwhile to help set the record straight at a site that many people vist: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whites_in_Zimbabwe" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whites_in_Zimbabwe</a> (if we stick together, it will be hard for the limpwits to revert our edits).</p>

		<p>As someone who lived in South Africa for 24 years before escaping in 1999, The Zimbabwe situation will now greatly improve as long as no iad is givern to that country by the outside world.   The people inside te coiuntry must rise up and kill Mugabe form that is te only way he will go, and then the freed bvlack Zimabaweans can work hard for 100 years to make their country economically sound ahain as it was when Ian Smith was prime minister.  But seriously, Mugabe is another African black maniac leader who has to date escapd justice for the 20 - 30 000 Ndebele tribesmen he killed when he came to power in 1980.</p>
<p>Also, the whole argument against the white Africans who were instrumental in Rhodesia&rsquo;s success story is that when the whites first arrived (anbout 1880), there were about 400 000 black tribesmen there many of whom (Ndebele) had fled there to escape another black despot called Shaka Zulu who killed thousands in South Africa.   Africans have their own ways of population controls. When Mugabe with the help of the outside World came to power in 1980, there was an 11 million population in Rhodesia, motlñy blacks.  The whites were a nasty lot weren&rsquo;t they allowing the black population to increase  by so many?  The land that was converted to farmland was just bush or not utilised and the food production allowed the population to increase as well as the export of food to other countries in Africa increased to economic riches of Rhodesia.  With this in mind, I know who the real racists are when they accuse African Whites of being bad, and they are of all colours but fools who mean well but are really stupid.</p>

		<p>The writing has been on the wall for White Rhodesians since their leaders abandoned the struggle and Zimbabwe was born.  There are still plenty of every-man-for-himself Whites there, and in South Africa, who watched the farmers being robbed and murdered but continued to do business in their own sector hoping that they would be allowed to maintain control as long as they greased the pathetic Zimbabwean economy and kept Mugabe in luxury.</p>
<p>There is not much more that could possibly have been done to make their eventual dispossession obvious.  I suppose Mugabe and his thugs could have picked up the section of wall that had the proverbial writing on it, and beaten the remaining Whites over the head with it, but even that would probably not have been enough to get their attention.</p>
<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s all over but the crying.  The remaining White Rhodesians are now thoroughly and brutally trapped - they will be lucky indeed if they are able to escape the country with any assets intact.</p>
<p>They should liquidate what they can, destroy all business records, sales lists etc, and get out of the country by hook or crook.  I hope that all who are forced into giving control to Black Zimbabweans will make sure that their former businesses require a lot of work to get back up and running.  It would be a real shame if the new owners were launched to prosperity (or the bizarre Zimbabwean equivalent thereof) with an act of theft.</p>
<p>May God help the remaining Rhodesians.</p>

		<p>After all the hoopla in the West to give Africa over to black rule, who in power is going to blame the catastrophic conditions there on anything but the legacy of colonialism?  The left is noticably silent on the whole sorry affair.  <br>
The only sub-Saharan countries with their heads above water are either those that power-share with whites or allow the latter to handle the commercial sector.  Some other African nations have invited whites back, primarily to lease and manage farm land.  Mugabe, however, will never do this.  He will have to be deposed or die before Zimbabwe has any chance at all.</p>

		<p>Yes, taking businesses is unjust, but if a white person is staying in Zimbabwe and doing business there, they kind of deserve it. After all, did they think that THEIR property would be safe?

		<p>An historic decline in wheat production to 6% of what it was a decade earlier.  How&rsquo;s that land policy workin&rsquo; for ya&rsquo;?<br>
&#8216;Wheat production in Zimbabwe, once termed the region&rsquo;s breadbasket, has fallen to 18,000 tonnes in 2009-10, a fraction of the 300,000 tonnes or so the country produced a decade before and low even by the standards of the country&rsquo;s recent tumultuous political and economic period. The decline reflected a liquidity squeeze prompted by the country&rsquo;s switch, in the face of hyperinflation, from the Zimbabwe dollar to legalising use of a number of foreign currencies, US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s staff said. &#8220;A large proportion of wheat farmers failed to secure funding for production,&#8221; a report from the USDA&rsquo;s Pretoria bureau said, noting that farmers bought only a small portion of the 6,000 tonnes of seed wheat available for planting. &#8220;Financial institutions could only offer short-term - predominantly 30-90 day - credit at high interest rates that was unsuitable for agricultural projects.&#8221; Meanwhile, the risk of power cuts deterred farmers relying on irrigation for healthy crops. The decline leaves Zimbabwe&rsquo;s wheat crop below both a government target of 100,000 tonnes and domestic requirements for 238,000 tonnes.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>With the currency there in free-fall, these businesses are probably valueless, anyway.  Moreover, anyone dumb enough to stick around in a country where the government respects absolutely no rule of law deserves to lose their business.</p>

		<p>The Big Business deserves everything they get at the hands of the racist Mugabe regime. It was the businesses (most of them international) who supported the transfer of power. They thought that if they changed the government an replaced it with a black fascist dictatorship that they&rsquo;d be re-warded. Most of all they thought if Mugabe came to power the country would become stable enough invest in Zimbabwean resources.</p>
<p>I feel really bad for the white Zimbabweans left who still own small mom and pop shops, and made a living off of farming. But I do not feel bad for the mega banks like Barclays or Rio Tinto mining conglomerate who could be effected. It is the corporations along with the Communist who supported the changes in Zimbabwe. They couldn&rsquo;t of supported someone who was more balanced.</p>
<p>One good thing about Zimbabwe is that you can bet there is no white Zimbabwean left who still supports Communism. Those same corporations and white Communist that also supported black empowerment and racism in Zimbabwe are now being effected there, but also in South Africa, and the US.</p>

		<p>Whites should have left Rhodesia as soon as possible after Mugabe took power and I&rsquo;m certain many have left already. It will be more difficult to leave now and become more difficult with each passing day. It&rsquo;s better to leave your assets behind and save your life. It&rsquo;s going to get worse; much worse, not just for whites but for anyone outside of the ruling class. Zimbabwe is a catastrophe in slow motion. Look for mass slaughter in league with Rwanda and starvation similar to Somalia in the not too distant future. New Zealand, Argentina and Chile are three countries worth considering, for whites leaving Africa.</p>

<p>The white population is about 60% there, about the same as the US. They have similar problems with race that we do. I was reading a NZ newspaper last year. Some Samoan thugs were extorting monthly &#8220;protection money&#8221; from white farmers by means of bullying and threats. One day a white NZ farmer shot one and killed one of them in self defense. The liberal NZ court system tried to send the farmer to prison for life. He lost all of his land and life savings to win his freedom&hellip;sound familiar? </p>
<p>About three years ago, I met an African-American woman who was moving to NZ to escape other African Americans. She actually admitted this to me. She wanted to escape the violence, threat of rape, etc. She warned that if I ever visit NZ, stay out of Auckland. It has diversity and it&rsquo;s as bad as any U.S. city. She told me to go to the South Island, that has a majority white population. It&rsquo;s much safer and nicer. Yes, a black American woman told me this.</p>

		<p>The same fate awaits South Africa, which is already been dubbed South Zimbabwe. The uncrowned beasts of the field are eyeing the mines and the banks and all cartels, although they deny it, but we know how the savage brain works. In SA the water supply system is infected, the powersupply infrastructure is crumbling, the roads are full of potholes, robots at intersections barely work, the whole cuntry is so filthy that our national flower is actually the plastic bags. The savage&rsquo;s attitude is it is their country and they will run it as they seem fit. The crime is completely out of proportion and is directed at the whites. More than a million whites have left this cuntry and these who are left behind has no chance in hell to be accepted in any other country. We are stuck here only to get raped and murdered.</p>

		<p>So my grandparents fled the bolsheviks because they were threatening them in the Caucasus in the 20s and 30s. They ended up in Iran where their children had to flee the Ayatollah. Then they went to Zimbabwe with their engineering degrees and built up businesses in construction, engineering services, and transportation. And on top of that they have to bribe people to ensure their safety since they are evil, pale, and in mum&rsquo;s case, blonde.</p>

Russia has terrible endemic problems of corruption and political patronage. The economy seems frozen in the Soviet era, and yet, I remain optimistic about the long term prospects for Russia. It is a country rich in both human and natural resources. </p>
<p>Twenty years from now the United States will still be a better place to live than Russia but how about fifty years from now? I can&rsquo;t see how the United States will avoid becoming a Soviet style Brazil, a Brazil without the fun.  I don&rsquo;t think we have much of a future unless our country separates into smaller better governed regional countries. </p>

		<p>What did we expect? You put an African &#8220;liberator&#8221; into power, and he wrecks the economy, drives out the Whites, and sets himself up as  dictator for life. Same story as in the rest of Africa, only toss in the fact that Mugabe was an out and out Marxist from day one, and this was well known by the people who backed him in the West. </p>
<p>This ought to be a lesson-learned for the rest of the West of what will happen when Whites become minorities in their own countries. Alas, given the prevailing ideology of liberalism, such conclusions are not within the realm of public discourse. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;white Africans&#8221; are just as &#8220;African&#8221; as the blacks (if not more).  </p>
<p>The whites took a barren land and turned it into one of the most fertile, productive, food-producing parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Everywhere blacks proliferate, they destroy their environment.  They are destroyers, not builders.</p>
<p>Even under &#8220;apartheid&#8221;, blacks flocked to South Africa because conditions there were so much better than in the rest of Africa.<br>
Most people do not know that &#8220;apartheid&#8221; was put in place to keep the normally-warring black &#8220;tribes&#8221; from killing each other.</p>
<p>Blacks were &#8220;given&#8221; a once-proud city in good condition (Detroit) and in short order destroyed it.  Of course their (liberal) &#8220;excuse&#8221; is that the &#8220;housing stock&#8221; is old and that &#8220;racism&#8221; was a factor.  To this day, you can see the elderly white homeowner (that cannot afford to move) that has a neatly manicured lawn, flower beds, a freshly painted house and next door a burnt out hulk, an empty lot or a poorly-maintained house occupied by blacks.</p>
<p>A number of years back, I was &#8220;volunteered&#8221; by my company to participate in a &#8220;do-good&#8221; project called &#8220;paint the town&#8221;.  This &#8220;effort was meant to help those who needed small repairs (and possibly painting) done to their houses.  The house my &#8220;crew&#8221; was assigned to was occupied by a black man, his wife (girlfriend) and three strong black &#8220;bucks&#8221; approximately 16 to 19 years of age.  The three sons sat on the porch drinking their &#8220;fortys&#8221; and smoking &#8220;blunts&#8221; while we worked to get their house in order.  The homeowner was OK with the color of paint, his &#8220;wife&#8221; complained constantly about the color while their three &#8220;sons&#8221; &#8220;kicked back&#8221; with their &#8220;refreshments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never again would I be &#8220;volunteered&#8221; into supporting such a misguided effort unless it were to help a white homeowner.</p>

		<p>The only problem with Russia is that Chinese are swarming in in the eastern territories and the underbelly of russia is all turkic.  They need to cut loose about 30% of those places and ban all immigration of non-whites to what remains.  Also, police the borders with china and throw all the chinese out.</p>

		<p>Have a look at Zim Real Estate. Burgler Bars, Emergency Power &amp; Water, Electric Fences.Prices in trillions of worthless Zim Dollars. Says a lot. Then if the whites can sell up and leave we have do-gooders here in Oz who are concerned that former Rhodesians will bring their raciast attitudes with with them and as such are not welcome!</p>
