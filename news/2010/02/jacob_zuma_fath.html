			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sebastien Berger, London Telegraph, January 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The South African president, Jacob Zuma, is reported to have has fathered a 20th child with the daughter of a friend.</p>
<p>His latest offspring, a girl, was reported on Sunday to have been born in October to Sonono Khoza, 39, the divorced daughter of Irvin Khoza, according to the country&rsquo;s Sunday Times newspaper. Mr Khoza is the chairman of the organising committee for the football World Cup finals to be held in South Africa later this year.</p>
<p>Mr Zuma, 67, is a proud Zulu traditionalist, and as well as his polygamy  &mdash;  he married his third current wife and fifth overall, Thobeka Madiba, earlier this month  &mdash;  he has had a number of children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>In all, he has had children by seven women.</p>
<p>The paper said that the Khoza family were not happy about the liaison  &mdash;  Mr Khoza is six years younger than the president  &mdash;  and a delegation from the president had visited them to discusss inhlawulo, the customary Zulu damages payable when a child is born out of wedlock.</p>
<p>Last week Mr Zuma defended himself against accusations that polygamy was &#8220;a step backward&#8221; or unfair to women in a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>
<p>&#8220;People interpret cultures in different ways,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some think that their culture is superior to others, that&rsquo;s a problem we have in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In South Africa, he went on, &#8220;we follow a policy that says you must respect the cultures of others. That&rsquo;s my culture. It does not take anything from me, from my political beliefs and everything, including the belief on the equality of women&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Zuma&rsquo;s personal life is not an issue for most South Africans. But Helen Zille, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said that it was counterproductive given the country&rsquo;s fight against HIV-Aids.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some people who may argue that Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s sex life is a matter of private morality or &#8216;culture&rsquo;, but this is not so,&#8221; she claimed.</p>
<p>Pointing out that after his rape trial, when he was acquitted, he had apologised for having unprotected sex with the HIV-positive daughter of a family friend, she added: &#8220;He has once again succeeded in sending the wrong message to the South African people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Zuma&rsquo;s spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, could not be reached for comment on Sunday.<br>

		<p>A minor correction is in order: Mr. Zuma&rsquo;s polygamy is not an issue for most BLACK South Africans. I suspect whites, particularly the Calvinist Afrikaners, have a different view.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true, unless, of course, they want a spear through their heads.</p>

		<p>@anonymous no1: That depends on whom you speak to, neo-liberals are unhappy and right wingers don&rsquo;t care, it is his culture and race who are western reporters to hold Zuma to there ideas of morality and culture. All we want is the same justice, when we invest in our private white schools, our private white bank and private white town and all the other projects that has sprung up in the last ten years or so, we don&rsquo;t want American and European reporters to come here, just to tell the world how backwards and racist we are. This is Africa not Disneyland! You do what you must to survive, but the demographics of Europe is changing fast, we will see just how accommodating they are when they become less then 30% of the population in there own countries, I predict a civil war in each and every one of those countries within this century and I&rsquo;ll put money on it!</p>

		<p>  South African President Jacob Zuma has gotten little publicity here in the United States. I can&rsquo;t understand why we aren&rsquo;t celebrating his unique Zulu cultural perspective. Could it be that fantasy multicultural preconceptions have led to mental &#8220;crimestop&#8221;  &mdash;   in Orwellian terms the stopping of all un-PC thoughts before one crosses the barrier into unacceptable &#8220;thoughtcrime.&#8221; </p>

<p>Aye, particularly when some have evolved over thousands of years whilst others have remained primitive.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there were SA whites who lamented that black rule would tumble them back into the law of the jungle.  And, of course, there were liberals who scoffed.  Well?</p>

		<p>Apparently, paraphrasing Will Rogers, Mr. Zuma never met a woman with whom he wasn&rsquo;t willing to copulate. Where are the feminists when they are needed? Shouldn&rsquo;t they be out protesting the chauvinist piginess of this guy? Get with it feminists. This guy should be your meat and potatoes!</p>

		<p>@ #7:  Feminism died during the Clinton administration.  They surface occasionally to attack Western civ, but it&rsquo;s been fairly quiet of late.  Heck, they&rsquo;ve won all their battles anyway.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. I mean, Hillary Clinton had pretty much everything to become the first American female president in history&hellip; And suddenly, this mulatto male comes out of nowhere, makes a number of speeches, talking about &#8220;hope&#8221;, and he gets to become the Democratic presidential candidate!</p>
<p>It seems like the American people thought an unqualified Mulatto man would make a better president than an experienced and qualified White woman. And I think it stinks!<br>
