<h1>World&rsquo;s Refugee Orphans Seeking Homes in the US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Contreras, AP, February 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has 700 refugee children in foster care, has asked states to prepare to foster more international refugee children like Majok, whose parents either have disappeared or been killed by war or natural disaster. The need is heightened by continuing armed conflicts in Africa and recent events such as the earthquake in Haiti.</p>
<p>The request means that Massachusetts and other states must ask more households to open up their homes for foster care or ask existing foster families to take in another refugee child at a</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Massachusetts, a state that historically has taken in one of the largest shares of the nation&rsquo;s unaccompanied refugee minors, has been asked to increase its current share of 93 to 125, said Richard Chacon, director of the Office for Refugees and Immigrants in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services says 14 states and the District of Columbia, participate in the federal Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.</p>
<p>It is not the only way parentless refugee children can find safe haven in the U.S. The Obama administration, for example, recently said it will allow orphaned Haitian children to enter the U.S. temporarily on an individual basis. And some groups, like the Heartland Alliance in Illinois, help unaccompanied undocumented children by providing housing and legal representation.</p>
<p>The U.S. program, developed in the early 1980s to help thousands of parentless children in Southeast Asia, has aided more than 13,000 refugee children fleeing war, famine and economic turmoil. It remains the most consistent source for refugee children in the U.S., with the assistance of the United Nations.</p>
<p>In 2008, foster homes and related facilities in the United States and 67 other countries took in 16,300 orphans, according to Tim Irwin, the spokesman for the U.N.&rsquo;s High Commissioner for Refugees. {snip}</p>
<p>In the U.S., states license foster homes with the help of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The federal government reimburses states for all costs of the children&rsquo;s schooling, health care and related expenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cost of care for refugee minors varies, depending on need. In Massachusetts, the state Office for Refugees and Immigrants has budgeted about $3 million to serve 93 minors.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s State Refugee Coordinator Charles Shipman said his state has been asked to increase its numbers from 43 to 63. Arizona can find those new foster homes, Shipman said, but it&rsquo;s going to take some time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hilliard [Sherrill Hilliard, program manager for Refugee Immigration &amp; Assistance Program in Washington.] said her state has been asked to double up from 50 to 100 children. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve already got eight more on the way,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>That works out to $32,258.06 each.</p>
<p>The only way to deal with this nonsense is to push the race question front and center. It&rsquo;s scandalous to have our tax dollars paying for our genocidal race replacement.</p>

		<p>What a scam. Let&rsquo;s just bring in the whole world and all their orphans! Like we don&rsquo;t have enough of our own kids that need good homes!  The Catholic and Lutheran Churches need to be picketed or whatever to bring attention to their help with the destruction of America, especially White America. Since it is WHITES that take these nonwhite kids in they are essentially enabling their own race&rsquo;s demise. Keep on flooding America with nonwhites with te help of Whites themselves. Ironic isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Feds want states to increase the number of refugee children they take in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the fed wants the country to economically collapse even faster than it&rsquo;s doing right now.</p>
<p>Fear not, this entire multicultural mish mash of insanity is on the way out and will be replaced by the greatest austerity and chaos this country has EVER seen.</p>
<p>The empire isn&rsquo;t going to be able to support itself, let alone &#8220;refugees.&#8221;  Too bad for the lefties who just can&rsquo;t seem to understand the very simple concept of overloading the system with freeloaders when the country can&rsquo;t take care of its own citizens.</p>

<p>Masscahusetts is facing a $5 billion budget shortfall. Any guesses as to why? Spending $3 million on just 93 kids (who aren&rsquo;t even American) isn&rsquo;t how you balance the budget.</p>

		<p>The State of California is going bankrupt   &mdash;   yet California is one of the states that has agreed to accept these Third World orphans. Of course the white families that nest these orphans will receive financial aid from the taxpayers. We already have an excess of illegal aliens and now we will receive even more. It is part of the plot to destroy the white race.</p>

		<p>More Democratic votes in the future for the complete race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. Any flimsy excuse to vote import new Democatic voters. The Democratic party-along with the Republicam party-is waging a vicious race war aganst the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population. Without non-white foreigners, the Democratic party would be a minor and insignificant party by now. Treason is the reason.</p>

		<p>It is ammoral and a careless disregard for the environment to remove children from their culture of origin.<br>
Actually it is human trafficking.<br>
These children are used as novelty window dressing for misguided sanctimonious adults with ego deficits. When the resettled children grow up the situation becomes much more complicated.<br>
They are markedley lonely and have difficulty finding mates.<br>
These children are NOT thriving in the United States and people who think that they can change mother nature are arrogant and selfish.</p>
