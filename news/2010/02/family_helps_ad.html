<h1>Family Helps Adopted Haitian Children Keep Their Spiritual Heritage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Manya Brachear, Chicago Tribune, January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Images of the washed-out Haitian hillside where their children&rsquo;s relatives lived have led Peter and Paula Fitzgibbons to fear that their adopted son and daughter have no biological family left.</p>
<p>The strongest bond their children Odeline and Sevvy Dominique Fitzgibbons may have to their homeland now is the way they &#8220;serve the spirits&#8221; and speak to God.</p>
<p>Every night since Jan. 12, when a devastating earthquake hit the children&rsquo;s homeland, the couple have assembled them in their Evanston den for Vodou prayers, part of their effort to preserve their children&rsquo;s ties to Haiti through a religion they argue has been misinterpreted and unfairly portrayed.</p>
<p>With Haitian tunes echoing from the kitchen, Odeline, 9, Sevvy, 8, and their 5-year-old sister Isa stand before an altar with their parents, light candles and call upon Papa Legba, the Vodou spirit and gatekeeper who admits other spirits into the sacred circle to hear the family&rsquo;s prayers.</p>
<p>Together, the family whirls and twirls around the living room, pounding drums, shaking tambourines and chanting to invoke the pantheon of spirits, or lwa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following the advice of international adoption experts, the Fitzgibbonses, both 41, have tried to help their children maintain a cultural connection to Haiti. But they have taken it a step further by including religion.</p>
<p>They believe their children can learn the value of Vodou (properly pronounced VO-doo) in a Christian context.</p>
<p>Vodou &#8220;is interwoven into every bit of a Haitian person&rsquo;s life,&#8221; said Paula Fitzgibbons, a former Lutheran pastor. &#8220;I&rsquo;m at least presenting them with some part of their spiritual heritage. I can offer them enough that they will be familiar with Vodou when they get to the point of making their own choices about spirituality and religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Known by the Creole word meaning &#8220;sacred,&#8221; Vodou has been the principal religion of the Haitian population since the 16th century. Born from the fusion of African traditions introduced by slaves and Western traditions such as Roman Catholic rituals, Vodou is a monotheistic religion that believes God is the singular and superior power. But practitioners of Vodou, called serviteurs, call on lwa to intervene much like saints in the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Vodou believers and experts say the religion bears little resemblance to the derogatory stereotypes of it, which partly are based on Hollywood portrayals of &#8220;voodoo&#8221; from the early 20th century.</p>

		<p> Another well-intentioned, naive White couple who couldn&rsquo;t wait to try to expiate their &#8220;White guilt&#8221; by adopting little black children. If Haiti is so wonderful, why didn&rsquo;t they leave them there and let some Haitian couple adopt them? Why do we of the Caucasian persuasion feel that it&rsquo;s our duty to &#8220;rescue&#8221; all the dusky young of the world from the terrors of their homelands?</p>
<p> And for that matter, if their &#8220;Haitian heritage&#8221; is so important, are they going to grow up speaking only Creole? Isn&rsquo;t it more important for the well-being of children that the religious heritage they grow up with not be a mixture that will just confuse them? Have we White Christians grown so mushy in our beliefs that we think a faith of straight-out Christianity would not be &#8220;good enough&#8221; for these kids? Would it be &#8220;too White&#8221;? These tortured efforts by the couple, and the writer, to equate Voodoo with Christianity are mainly laughable. </p>

		<p>This is really sad.  Obviously the Fitzgibbons aren&rsquo;t Christians or this voodoo worship would never be tolerated in their household.  What&rsquo;s even more disgusting is their real child in the photo is participating in these rituals.  I have to wonder if by reading the first sentence of this article, they snatched these children without verifying whether their relatives were dead or not.  There was a similar story in the news a few days ago about some group of Whites kidnapping children in Haiti they claimed to be orphans but weren&rsquo;t.  This is not about compassion but something sinister if they&rsquo;re willing to break up families.  But for what purpose?  Are they marxists training a future generation of nonwhites against Americans?  </p>

		<p>Interesting piece.</p>
<p>But we might want to consider what would happen to a couple with adoptive white children who indoctrinated them with voodoo rituals and teachings.</p>
<p>The social services and child protective gestapo would yank the kids out of that home in a matter of seconds.  And for once, they&rsquo;d be right.</p>

		<p>This is evil.  They have a real daughter, Isabel, who is being corrupted by this insane obsession.  Give them time, the former Lutheran pastor and her husband will slit the girl&rsquo;s throat on an alter to pacify Papa Legba and his spirits.  </p>

		<p>There are two possibilities:  Either voodoo is complete and utter nonsense (and thus a waste of time and mental energy) or it really works, and you can call forth spirits to wreak revenge on your enemies.  In the latter case that former Lutheran pastor is going straight to hell.</p>

		<p>If these liberal whites want their adopted black children to maintain their dysfunctional black heritage, then why don&rsquo;t they move with the kids to Haiti or some country in Africa? Their adopted black children will then be immersed in black culture. This would also have the benefit of most likely de-liberalizing the liberal whites real fast once they see what black majority countries are like, and they&rsquo;ll hoof it back to the States leaving behind the adopted children they thought they loved.</p>

		<p>Hasn&rsquo;t there been any screening of the people who&rsquo;ve grabbed some of these Haitian kids? They seem like a very strange pair. Perhaps the state child protection department should take a look at them for the sake of the children&rsquo;s safety. How did they manage to get these kids so quickly? Is there a child trafficking racket taking place here? </p>

		<p>Notice that, while talking about stereotypes, the highly biased writer didn&rsquo;t say which of the common conceptions about voodoo are wrong. Is it putting a curse on your enemies? Cannibalism? The reanimation of dead bodies? If any of these are a part of voodoo then I know all I need to know about voodoo.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;They believe their children can learn the value of Vodou (properly pronounced VO-doo) in a Christian context.&#8221;</p>
<p>   What Christian context? Procession by spirits (Loa) is considered demonic in Christianity. There is no other context. Baron Samidi, Legba and Voodoo Gods would be considered Satanic. </p>

		<p>Such are the poisonous fruits of &#8220;every religion is as good as the next&#8221; mentality and liberal induced white guilt. It is absolutely heinous that these idiot white parents are subjecting their own real daughter to this madness. As much as I distrust child family services I wouldn&rsquo;t mind them removing her in this case. As Michael Savage (who I don&rsquo;t always agree with) states: liberalism is a mental disorder. Unfortunately I suspect most cases of it are terminal.</p>

<p>The little white girl looks as if she&rsquo;s been crying, and has an odd, shell-shocked look on her face. The Haitian voodooene (sp?), the black girl the White idiots plucked off the island, has her by the WRIST and is guiding/forcing the White child to light the satanic candle!   </p>

I&rsquo;m an Agnostic who leans toward Atheism, and this disgusts even me. </p>
<p>I believe no religion is &#8220;true&#8221; in a factual sense   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m also well aware that some religions are better than others. To evaluate the various major faiths in an objective, secular way, all one need do is look at the societies the respective religions have generated over the centuries. Some faiths clearly can have a beneficial effect on their adherents   &mdash;   while other belief systems have an undeniably NEGATIVE effect. </p>
<p>In the former category I would include the Judeo-Christian tradition (which I admire and embrace culturally if not spiritually). Also, the Japanese seem to have done quite well by their Shinto/Buddhism. </p>
<p>In the latter category of religions that retard and degrade their societies I&rsquo;d put Islam (look up Churchill&rsquo;s quotes on &#8220;Mohammadanism&#8221;) and of course Haiti&rsquo;s own gift to the world, Vodou. This nihilistic, violent, superstitious and (I&rsquo;m sorry but it must be said) extremely silly combo platter of dumbed-down Catholicism and prehistoric African animism (with a side order of animal sacrifice) is obviously not a winner in the spirituality sweeptstakes. Belief in Vodou has undoubtedly played a large role in making Haiti the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. It is a religion of failure. </p>
<p>That do-gooders in America want to foster the acceptance of this obnoxious gobbledegook for losers, is indefensible. It makes me agree with those posters who say &#8220;liberalism is a mental disorder.&#8221; </p>
