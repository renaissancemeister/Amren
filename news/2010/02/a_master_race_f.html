<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/feb/16/animalwelfare-peta">A Master Race for Dogs Is Wrong</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Poorva Joshipura, Guardian (London), February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The demonstration by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) US outside the Westminster Dog Show  &mdash;  in which two Peta US members dressed up like KKK members to make the case that the KKK and the American Kennel Club (AKC) are in some ways two peas in a pod  &mdash;  understandably raised a few eyebrows. But it also raised a good point: the AKC is all about the perverted idea of a master race and so is the KKK.</p>
<p>Seeing people in white capes is deeply uncomfortable. But only someone with an axe to grind about Peta US&rsquo;s work to stop animal exploitation in all its forms, or someone with no idea about its principles, would dare suggest that it set out to offend people of colour. As an Indian woman who grew up in the American south, I&rsquo;m well aware of the very real struggles that minorities face, and as a long-time Peta Europe staffer, I can assure you of Peta US&rsquo;s abiding support for all struggles and its courageous position in going beyond what is comfortable to those who wish to preserve the status quo.</p>
<p>We want people to see that if they are outraged  &mdash;  as they should be  &mdash;  by the way the KKK arbitrarily labels certain people &#8220;inferior&#8221; simply because of the way they look, they should also be outraged that the AKC does the same thing to dogs.</p>
<p>In its quest for &#8220;pure bloodlines&#8221;, the AKC requires breeders to put twisted ideas about what they think dogs should look like  &mdash;  when traits are deliberately exaggerated by breeding  &mdash;  before dogs&rsquo; health. As a result of inbreeding and breeding for distorted physical features, about one in four purebred dogs is afflicted with serious congenital defects. For example, Labrador retrievers  &mdash;  America&rsquo;s most popular dog  &mdash;  are prone to bone disease, haemophilia and retinal degeneration, and nearly 60% of golden retrievers suffer from hip dysplasia. The British bulldog is prone to breathing difficulty, hip problems, skin problems and premature death.</p>
<p>In response to public outcry, the AKC&rsquo;s British counterpart, the Kennel Club, has at least issued new breed standards in an attempt to stop &#8220;encouraging features that might prevent a dog from breathing, walking and seeing freely&#8221;, but breeders are fighting this. Yet the AKC continues to encourage breeding for features that cause dogs pain and, often, early deaths.</p>
<p>The AKC&rsquo;s standards also require many breeds to endure painful, unnecessary cosmetic mutilations that are condemned by the American Veterinary Medical Association, including having their ears and tails cut off. Some breeders even kill puppies that are born the &#8220;wrong&#8221; colour.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the AKC and the Kennel Club knowingly contribute to the millions of dogs who are dumped and/or euthanised in shelters every year for lack of homes by encouraging breeders to keep producing litter after litter of puppies in hopes of winning show titles. Many of the dogs breeders produce will go on to have litters of their own, further contributing to the overpopulation crisis. Every single puppy born to a breeder takes away a home that could have gone to a dog in an animal shelter. And when shelter dogs aren&rsquo;t adopted, they pay with their lives  &mdash;  or sometimes worse, like lifelong confinement in a cage or kennel.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alice Walker said it best when she wrote: &#8220;Blacks aren&rsquo;t made for whites, women aren&rsquo;t made for men, and animals aren&rsquo;t made for humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like humans, all dogs are created equal, and all dogs deserve good health and loving homes, regardless of their &#8220;heritage&#8221;. Please, say &#8220;No&#8221; to breedism. Boycott breeders and save lives by adopting homeless dogs from an animal shelter or rescue group.<br>

		<p>However, the fact still remains:  Salukis are still the fastest runners, bloodhounds have the most acute sense of smell, and border collies round up sheep the best.  You can&rsquo;t expect a saluki to round up sheep very well, can you?  It&rsquo;s not that either a saluki, border collie or bloodhound is a &#8220;master breed,&#8221; it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re bred as dogs for different purposes.  </p>

		<p>I hate PETA.  Nothing but a bunch of psycho, self serving, hypocrites.  They have euthanized more than their fair share of animals, going so far as to buying a large walk in freezer to hold the corpses.  Also the president(or whatever they call her), a diehard anti animal medical testing advocate, uses insulin produced in pigs to survive.</p>
<p>But as a dog lover I have to agree a little with this, a lot of breeds produced have all sorts of problems from inbreeding.  I&rsquo;ve lost a couple of good hunting dogs to these inherited problems.</p>

		<p>Reputable breeders work to improve the breed, not just looks, but also health, temperament and intelligence. They breed only the very best dogs together after careful research into each potential breeder&rsquo;s heritage and based on how well they match the breed standard. They will not breed dogs with congenital  diseases such as hip dysplasia or retinal atrophy, nor will they sell puppies who carry the genes for those diseases, unless the pup is neutered/spayed before sale. <br>
The author encourages people to purchase crossbred or mixed breed pups, and I agree that there are many adorable &#8220;mutts&#8221; out there that make wonderful, loving companions. But for every mutt sold, somebody will breed 4 more. The sad truth is people will produce what the public will buy. If people quit buying puppies from pet shops, puppy mills, backyard breeders and the  irresponsible owners of pets who &#8220;accidentally&#8221; produce litter after litter of mixed breeds, the production of them will slow to a trickle, though probably never completely halt. People should ONLY buy pets from reputable breeders, and for their part, these breeders should  make these puppies available at affordable prices. A puppy from 2 well-bred, well-trained working dogs  might very well sell for $1200 or more, but it&rsquo;s lesser well-comformed littermates can be sterilized and sold as pets for $300 each. **Note the constant appearance of the word REPUTABLE throughout this reply. <br>
One thing the author completely fails to mention is the disgusting practice of purposely creating &#8220;designer dogs&#8221;. A &#8220;labradoodle&#8221; or a &#8220;chiweenie&#8221; is nothing but a mutt with a fancy title, and purposely creating mutts is unethical. <br>
PETA kills far more animals annually than the Humane Society  &mdash;  another mis-named organization.       </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a huge contradiction in her piece. She rails against dogs having genetic difficulties and then says, in fact, makes it her main point, that she against &#8216;master racism&rsquo; genetic tinkering with dog breeds. If you don&rsquo;t want dogs to ever face genetic problems, &#8216;hemophilia&rsquo;, &#8216;retinal degeneration&rsquo;, and &#8216;hip dysplasia&rsquo; you&rsquo;d need to make sure dogs with these traits don&rsquo;t breed or don&rsquo;t breed so prodigiously. You&rsquo;d need to be practicing Eugenics. </p>
<p>I support Peta and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and it even seems they&rsquo;ve gotten the AKC to amend their practices here for the better, however, the only way to properly husband our favorite companion and man&rsquo;s best friend, and make no mistake we are responsible for this, is through the proper application of Eugenics</p>

<p>Like the human species, the animal species known as &#8220;canines&#8221; are comprised of various races or &#8220;breeds.&#8221;  And like the human races, canine breeds possess unequal degrees of intelligence, socialization, aggressiveness, impulse control and curiosity.    </p>

<p>The breeds of dogs come from humans forcing the same breed to mate, and are only a couple hundred years old.</p>
<p>The breeds of humans, on the other hand, come from nature, and are a hundred thousand years old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reputable breeders&#8221; should be on the FOREFRONT of legislation requiring sensible breeding laws, instead they only fight laws intended to stop the slaughter of millions of healthy sane dogs every year in this countries &#8220;shelters&#8221;.</p>
<p>With modern technology dog breeders could be licensed the same way other professions are licensed, with microchipping those that breed and sell puppies that end up being killed in shelters could be punished. There is a sensible solution to the problem but those &#8220;reputable breeders&#8221; never want to find the sensible solution, they only fight every idea or bill suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breeders&#8221; say they care about the millions of dogs killed in shelters but in fact they don&rsquo;t, in reality they only care about their own lines and if that means millions of other dogs have to die because of the &#8220;rights&#8221; granted to puppymills and backyard breeders well they are fine with that.</p>

		<p>This Hindu is making our case.  By declaring that &#8220;breedism&#8221; is the same thing as &#8220;racism&#8221;, she is claiming that the differences between races are as real as the differences between dog breeds.  It&rsquo;s a matter of biology.  <br>
     In mathematics, it is recognized that you can disprove an idea by demonstrating that the logical consequences of that idea are false or self-contradictory.  By extending the idea of &#8220;racism&#8221;, the anti-Whites are digging their own grave. </p>

<p>To 4  &mdash;  Anonymous, I have to take issue with you saying breeding mutts is unethical. What the heck is wrong with a labradoodle? They seem to be very nice dogs. Do they have any genetic problems, or does this mixed-breed have any good qualities not found in either of its parental lines? My sister has a labradoodle-like dog and he has been health, happy and well-tempered.</p>

		<p>Peta can be very hypocritcal..but intentionally breeding certain dogs in ways that cause pain or health problems falls on the shoulders fo the human beings who do so. It is moronic to intentionally hurt an animal in which you are responsible for its very existence. If you cared about the animal you would want it to be healthy.</p>

		<p>I bet mutts are some of the best dogs in the world, but its a ridiculous concept to say maintaining different lines of breeds is somehow immoral. This is the madness that stirs up trouble where it doesn&rsquo;t exist on its own. Marxist diversity freaks are pathological. I would however, like to see more people prepared,* before bringing new life into this world, whether beast or animal. It is a Divinely beautiful world*, if we could only take the middle road between extremes.</p>

		<p>20 Grafted Devil:</p>
<p>Not long after the Federal law that included the endangered species list was enacted, some black civil rights group wanted to add black men to the list of endangered species.  (Interesting that the only chose one gender and one race, while all along they say there&rsquo;s no such thing as race and we&rsquo;re all one big happy species, or are supposed to be.)  </p>
<p>Since the number of black men is increasing, the request was denied, but nobody thought to tell these people that it&rsquo;s racist to be put in the same league as an animal.  They wanted to be on the EDL for more police protection and money, but they can&rsquo;t see the obvious hypocrisy, for they scare away their extra police protection by calling it racist and asking for civilian review boards and filing civil rights lawsuits against it.  Money?  Don&rsquo;t even get me going.</p>
<p>As an aside, I am sure that some people thought that the epidemic of black crime of a few decades ago would result in black auto-genocide.  Or rather, they were hoping that it would result in auto-genocide.  </p>
<p>Not happening.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say there are ten human beings in this world, one man and nine women.  All the people are functional adults, and all births are single children only, no multiples.  This means that every nine months, there can be nine new humans, raising the population to 19.  In a year and a half, the population is 28.  In two and a quarter years, the population is 37.  In three years, the population 46.</p>
<p>Reverse the situation, ten people, nine men and one woman.  In nine months, the population is 11.  In a year and a half, the population is 12.  In 2.25 years, the population is 13.  In three years, the population is 14.</p>
<p>Therefore, the higher percentage of your population that is fertile women, the faster your rate of population growth can be.</p>
<p>Black gang violence has almost entirely been at the hands of older boys and young men, killing older boys and young men.  Ergo, no auto-genocide.  There would have to be a pandemic of black girls and women, ages 13-35, being murdered.  And it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be happening, because I think people are programmed and hard wired against it, for the very obvious reason.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind, this idiotic article was published in The Guardian, which is the most extreme, left-wing newspaper in all of Britain. And as for Poorva Joshipura, she is just another minority race-hukster who probably would never have had the opportunity to grow up in the American south if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the immigration act of 1965. I wonder, if she were living in the country whence her ancestors came, would she be writing articles about her culture&rsquo;s caste system and how in its hierarchy of humanity the &#8220;Untouchables&#8221; are frequently shunned and regarded the lowest &#8216;breed&rsquo; of all Indians? Of all people in the world to criticize the West of &#8216;breedism&rsquo;, an Indian like her is least qualified. </p>

Sure it is wrong, but hurting it has nothing to do with breeding it. Breeding an animal for certain desireable characteristics is not &#8220;hurting&#8221; it. In fact, genetic selection is what Mother Nature is doing all the time   &mdash;   to us as well.</p>
