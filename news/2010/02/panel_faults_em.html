			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tracy Jan, Boston Globe, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For too long, Emerson College has ignored the role racial bias plays in tenure and promotion, leading to an overwhelmingly white faculty and leaving blacks at a disadvantage, according to a pointed external review released yesterday.</p>
<p>The college commissioned the review last fall following the uproar over college officials&rsquo; denial of tenure to two black professors, a controversy that prompted soul-searching at the communications arts school in downtown Boston.</p>
<p>The three-member panel found no overt racism barring the recruitment and retention of black professors. But it said enduring stigma and negative bias leaves black academics in a &#8220;caste-like position,&#8221; in which their intellectual worth and contributions are often undervalued and their advancement slowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not intended, but it&rsquo;s the result of patterns that perpetuate forms of discrimination,&#8221; said Ted Landsmark, a civil rights activist and president of Boston Architectural College who headed the review panel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The review panel  &mdash;  which included Evelynn Hammonds, dean of Harvard College, and JoAnn Moody, a national consultant on faculty diversity and development  &mdash;  recommends that Emerson provide better mentoring and professional development for tenure-track faculty, clarify departmental tenure requirements, and increase the multicultural competency of faculty and administrators to better recognize biases.</p>
<p>The report follows a recent MIT study highlighting the difficulties black and Hispanic faculty have getting promoted. MIT&rsquo;s unusually frank and comprehensive look at faculty diversity on its own campus and the experiences of underrepresented minority professors drew attention to a problem at colleges across the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Emerson report concluded that the college has done a poor job of nurturing and promoting black faculty, and said it should focus in the next five years on hiring black academics who are tenured elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are to be found at Emerson unexamined and powerful assumptions and biases about the superiority, preferability, and normativeness of European-American culture, intellectual pursuits, academic discourse, leadership, and so on,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Left unexamined, the biases result in the &#8220;disproportionate undervaluing of African-Americans and the disproportionate overvaluing of European-Americans,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Emerson is among many colleges with hiring and tenure procedures that appear, on the surface, to be neutral, but in practice lack the steps to assure that the widest possible candidate pool is recruited and that internal procedures do not create unintended biases, Landsmark said.</p>
<p>The panel suggested that Emerson suspend faculty searches that do not draw diverse candidates, a practice other colleges have also instituted.</p>
<p>&#8220;People tend to hire and work with the people they know,&#8221; Landsmark said. &#8220;As a consequence, it sometimes takes a modicum of additional effort to reach beyond circles of immediate comfort to include talented individuals who may not have emerged from the same social groups.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Wow, how non specific can one be?</p>
<p>This sentence makes very concrete sense:<br>
&#8220;The three-member panel found no overt racism barring the recruitment and retention of black professors.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sentence, however, actually contradicts the prior:<br>
&#8220;But it said enduring stigma and negative bias leaves black academics in a &ldquo;caste-like position,&rdquo; in which their intellectual worth and contributions are often undervalued and their advancement slowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would think an enduring stigma, negative bias, or &#8220;caste-like position&#8221; would be overt racism.</p>
<p>Really what one can deduce from the article is that they found no racism to explain the lack of black professors, so some indeterminate description of racism had to be generated.  How does a sane person generate a review like this?  An academic institution coming up with wording that would make Orwell proud.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm, affirmative action to get them in college.  Remedial courses and tutors to keep them in college.  Now they need special mentors to help them get tenure.  Is there anything they can do on their own?</p>

		<p>If Black professors have a hard time of it, you can blame: 1.) Affirmative Action. Whenever you see a black professor, you can automatically assume they&rsquo;re incompetent because of AA.  and 2.) How many Black professors teach &#8220;Black History&#8221;? How many Black History professors does a college need? Not many is my guess. When Blacks start teaching basic, in-demand subjects like science, math, English, you will see more tenured professors. </p>

		<p>from the article - &#8220;The Emerson report concluded that the college has done a poor job of nurturing and promoting black faculty&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words the college is guilty of not treating the blacks differently, for not giving them special attention and preferential treatment. Clearly what is racist here is the Emerson report itself.</p>

<p>How utterly and contemptibly laughable Comrade Jan!</p>
<p>This country, for far too long has witlessly exacerbated a mistake and ignored it. The role of chic anti-white bias has played in the tenure and promotion of an overwhelmingly white &ldquo;diversity elite&rdquo; has been leaving white both disadvantaged and subjected to a crudely soft genocide for half a century.</p>
<p>This has not been limited to university campuses mind you, but eroded an entire civilization.</p>
<p>Hint, you know the one I write of Comrade Jan, that civilization you hate most and feed off of, like an uncultured Red vulture; it is called, Western Civilization. </p>
<p>May God help us, and may that help include smiting &ldquo;diversity!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A good point.  How many black history professors does one college need, really?  Let&rsquo;s assume that there ARE some blacks around who majored in something else, like math, Chemistry, etc.  They WILL get hired.  The colleges will scramble to hire them for AA reasons.  BUT once hired, they will stay at a certain level and go no higher because they likely graduated from an all black college, don&rsquo;t really know their subject, and probably have to refer to clif notes to answer questions from bright undergrads.</p>

<p>Talk about getting it backwards!  The black professors and students are let into the college because of affirmative action and a dumbed-down curriculum.</p>
<p>The universities then spend years coddling and slobbering over black profs who speak ebonics, can barely spell and who teach fictional Afrocentric &#8220;history&#8221; claiming that the &#8220;Nubian&#8221; ancient Egyptians flew planes 4,000 years ago until their technology was stolen by the racist Wright Brothers.</p>

<p>Right  &mdash;  the assumption is that that the &#8220;intellectual pursuits&#8221; should be conducted at a high intellectual level!  What the panel is really recommending is that black faculty members not be held to the same standards of academic rigor as whites.  (Yet whites will still be held to the original standards.)</p>

		<p>until we give up on US universities as preeminent worldwide, and despite AA, hiring of profs at a good rsearch uni is geenrally based on quality, and as a rule that means indiviuals who have IQs above 125 at least and who have trained themselves with enoromous dedication and diligence over decades. </p>
<p>Most chairs of uni depts. would sell their first born to be able to recruit qualified blacks and hispanics as instructors, but you cannot conjure them from thin air.  </p>

		<p>Has this &#8221; panel &#8221; found fault with our national political parties, especial the more unconstitutional, Marxist party that names itself the demo-rat-ic one ? If not why not ? It was the socialist demo-rats which controlled all of D.C./federal decision law making that ended constitutional, representative democratic government ( The republican form of government )and replaced it with parasitic racialone by non-White &amp; non-Christians in the infamous, treasonous 1965 A.D. Immigration and Reform Act.The so called &#8221; oppositional party &#8221; the Republican &#8221; has only gone through the motions of making any kind of constituional correction because they have been co-conspiritors to America&rsquo;s genocide and culturalcide. </p>

		<p>One more example of the desperate search by liberals to sustain the usual excuses for black underachievement.  I assume that the black instructors at issue failed to accomplish particular achievements, like doing required paperwork, attending conferences, advancing their degrees, publishing work, etc.  If it was just a matter of offhandedly deciding who would get tenure, then I asssme the old affirmative-action model would do.  Obviously, all instructors at the institution know what the requirements are and would balk at someone advancing who did not perform them.  </p>

 All this psycho-babble is meant to hide the real &#8220;solution&#8221; Leftist/Statists want. QUOTAS- QUOTAS- QUOTAS!!! About the only way one advances in the academic world is through extensive publication of books and/or peer reviewed articles. If you haven&rsquo;t this record you don&rsquo;t climb the ladder to full Professor or even get tenure. Therefore, it&rsquo;s necessary to &#8220;find&#8221; hidden bias when minorities are involved.<br>
 I forget the name of the Black Harvard professor but it was during Summers stint as President of Harvard. The professor was spending his time making rap albums and Summers suggested he spend more time on true academic work. In a huff, he claimed discrimination and jumped ship to another Ivy League institution that gladly accepted him. Undoubtedly hidden bias at Harvard.<br>

		<p>Actually, rather interesting.  Emerson College is an undergraduate school for &#8220;communications&#8221; and &#8220;the arts.&#8221;  Nothing difficult going on there, and not many graduates will be able to do anything but teach high school english.  It ought to be a hive of ultra-liberals, but here it goes and tosses out a couple of black instructors.  Are them merely being rational?  Who would have thought it in such an environment!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;disproportionate undervaluing of African-Americans and the disproportionate overvaluing of European-Americans,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that say it all?  These people always shout about fair and un-fair then have the gall to say something like this.  The problem with these liberal psychopaths is they were never taught a very basic childhood rule, you can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>So which is it, panel?  You want equality for all, correct? But if ALL are given the chance to meet the SAME standards equally then why is one group overvalued?  I would like the panel to explain to me why &#8220;criteria issued and criteria met&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t satisfy requirement for advancement without being labeled.  </p>
<p>You give me YOUR hoop to jump through and I jump through successfully.  How is it my fault that the person behind me could not?  I guess I&rsquo;m over-rated for meeting the criteria YOU set?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the article&rsquo;s thought that one group needs to be nutured.  I thought you are looking for equality here.  Now one group needs &#8220;nuturing?&#8221;  Nuturing for what, to keep pace?  &#8220;Nuture&#8221; one group or keep it equal requirements for ALL.  Which is it?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s some appropriate questions to ask black candidates:</p>
<p>1.  What color of gang attire do the crips wear?</p>
<p>2.  If you a black man knocks up many women, he is responsible to pay for it and not make racist White people pay for it?  T/F</p>
<p>3.  Allowing blacks to have their own neighborhoods, companies, institutions, neighborhoods and to preserve their own race while not allowing whites the same is:</p>
<p>A.  Racist.<br>
B.  Hypocritical.<br>
C.  None of the above.<br>
D.  A and B.</p>
<p>4.  If you can&rsquo;t get a job or get harrassed by cops who are doing their job, it&rsquo;s always because of:</p>
<p>A. Racist white people<br>
B. You&rsquo;re a thug and disrespecting authority and laws<br>
C. You are unqualified and/or the employer can see it&rsquo;s going to more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth to hire you.<br>
D.  B and C<br>
E.  None of the above.</p>
<p>5.  It&rsquo;s perfectly logical, rational, and well-justified to hate all white people because a small amount of rich, white businessmen owned slaves before the Civil War.  True/False.</p>
<p>6.  A rare &#8216;rude&rsquo; comment or look a white person gives a black is far, far, far worse than the millions of whites that have been raped, robbed, assaulted, or killed at the hands of blacks since the days of integration?  True or False.</p>

		<p>As someone who is attending college now, what exactly have blacks bought to the table of civilization, as compared to whites. Meanwhile, my idiotic psychology textbook for example bends over to inform us about &#8220;contributions&#8221; of blacks to this field as well as exclusively validating Stephen Gould&rsquo;s theories only.  Just can&rsquo;t mention that awful Philip Rushton for example!<br>
Compared to whites and Asians,blacks have  largely been a blight on civilization, not contributors to it.  Anyone look at Haiti lately?</p>
