		<p>The first question that comes to mind is: Why does Gates, the perpetrator, even have possession of the handcuffs??? I assume Sgt. Crowley &#8220;donated&#8221; them himself, or handed them back to Gates.  If so, that is a contemptible move as yet another bows at the alter of Black demand.</p>

		<p>It would seem handcuffs used by police are Government property. Are police departments in the habit of giving the handcuffs used to restrain those they arrest to the arrestee, or is an exception made for those with political connections?</p>

		<p>Even though I can be a raging bigot at times, I&rsquo;m not that much of a bigot to think that handcuffs belong in the black wing of the Smithsonian museum.  HLG might be a kook, but I&rsquo;m sure there are a thousand things that you can display about him before a pair of handcuffs.  In fact, for Machiavellian reasons, I&rsquo;d rather have an anti-white bigoted quote of his on display than handcuffs.  Handcuffs you can buy at any one of those &#8220;shops.&#8221;  A juicy quotation will enrage whites.</p>
<p>Imagine the level of outrage that would have erupted if Lt. Drue Lackey of the Montgomery (AL) P.D. donated the cuffs he used to arrest Rosa Parks to an Alabama history museum.</p>

<p>When the police handcuff you, you do not get to keep the handcuffs. This is absurd, and a total con.</p>

		<p>How did Gates come to own these handcuffs?  Were they given to him for free, or did he purchase them.  Is it customary for police to give away equipment following arrest?  If I&rsquo;m arrested, can I get a gun, a baton, a stun-gun, or maybe even a police car?  Did the taxpayers pay for those handcuffs?</p>

		<p>So, the idea is to display the handcuffs as a permanent reminder of the evil racism of whites and the continuing suffering of poor African-Americans.  100 years from now, school children will still be marching through that racist propaganda museum, while &ldquo;I have a dream&rdquo; plays on a continuous loop in the background.</p>
<p>Will we ever see a museum display the bloody clothes of even one of the hundreds of thousands of Whites whom, over the last 40 years, have been murdered or raped by Blacks?  Will the guns, knives, and bleach used by the Black criminals be displayed?  Of course not.  </p>
<p>Ethnic grievance is only allowed for certain races.  <br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t those handcuffs belong to the arresting officer? So, not only was he caught lying about the incident after it was revealed the whole thing was caught on tape, he is a THEIF as well? I can&rsquo;t wait to see how they spin this story in that museum. It will be nothing close to what actually happened I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

		<p>This despicable man&rsquo;s lies are as bad as the ones told about the Jena incident.  He misbehaved attrociously and deserved to be arrested.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that anyone could be so dimwitted and arrogant at the same time. </p>
<p>But forget about lying blacks and the Smithsonian.  Neither will have much of a future after the deteriorating economic situation unfolding before us right now gets into a higher gear. </p>
<p>This is the year that will make it plain to those who can see that the empire is cracking too badly to ever be put back together again.  Like Humpty Dumpty.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t it be poetic justice to see old Henry ousted from his AA position at Harvard, because the funds just aren&rsquo;t there to continue giving freebies to blacks whose only qualifications to be a full professor of a nonsense subject like black studies is that he knows how to talk black street jive?</p>
<p>Incidentally, when did the police start giving handcuffs to those detained?  Couldn&rsquo;t be that old Henry&rsquo;s handcuffs were purchased at the flea market could it, while he runs his mouth with even more lies?</p>

		<p>This is like a baby donating their diaper to a Museum.<br>
In that the baby made the mess and it simply was the diapers job to contain it.<br>
 <br>
This Harvard Professor probably tossed and turned at night, guilty in the fact that he had never been victimized.<br>
All day teaching about how the White race has kept him and fellow blacks down, it no doubt became a gnawing pain.<br>
&#8220;I need to be victimized, where are my slave shackles?&#8221; <br>
His behaviour would have become worse, he would have become louder and shirtier (no misspell on this occasion, British expression) until that moment of joy arrived and opportunity locked him out of his own house.<br>
At last his inner world had manifested itself out into this world and become a self fulfilling prophecy.<br>
The stuff legends are made of. <br>
Now young people everywhere can go to this museum and shed a tear in memory of that truly awful day.<br>
What a sad little man he is.<br>

		<p>Example number 3,845,987 of how symbolism is perteptually confused with substance by Black America. Historically speaking, over time how will an event like this even make sense? In what context to do you put such an artifact, without dredging up the fact that it was Obama&rsquo;s ill-conceived, racially inflamatory commentary on the topic that escalated the whole thing to national fiasco status? </p>
<p>Another altogether forgettable moment in Black history elevated to a level of importance well beyond its actual meaning - how typical. </p>

		<p>Oh, what a marvelous and poignant gesture by Professor Gates!  By donating his handcuffs Dr. Gates powerfully underscores the inspiring fact that handcuffs and other restraining devices (such as jail cells) are at one with and virtually inseparable from the black experience in America.</p>
<p>He does America a great service in reminding us, all liberal orthodoxy to the contrary, that black Africans in America comprise the bulk of our criminal class and are striving to make further gains in this regard.</p>
<p>We all owe him a vote of thanks for bringing to our attention this often overlooked contribution to the American popular culture. </p>

		<p> Gates declared after his arrest &#8220;I am now a black man with a PRISON RECORD&#8221; which gives one an idea of how skewed his concept of reality is. The real story here is that he undoubtedly bought a pair of handcuffs and misrepresented them as the ones used in his arrest. Real handcuffs are not cheap and police departments don&rsquo;t give away items they keep an inventory of.</p>

<p>  Most blacks are bafoons like him, they believe the universe starts and ends with themselves as individuals as well as a race. Believe it or not, it was a Bangladeshi man who pointed out this characteristic about them to me many years back. And White people help in it too. We have been giving them too much consideration either positive or negative. In any non-White non-black country they would be ignored. There are descendants of black slaves from Iraq to India but they are ignored by the native people there. </p>

		<p>Blacks like HLG make their ethnic group into greater and greater pariahs every day.  Non-blacks have largely washed their hands of anything blacks do, so that any ridiculous action on the part of blacks is not just free of criticism, but mostly ignored.  They can claim that blacks came from the moon and that all the great inventors were really black, and other ethnic groups will just dismiss it all as laugable hoodoo, just as they did 50 years ago.  Blacks, as a group, can never advance in the esteem of mainstream society if they don&rsquo;t stop the nonsense that they perpetrate.</p>

		<p>Henry should donate his sizeable checks from white publishers and from the trillion dollar corporation known as &#8220;Harvard&#8221; to the Smithsonian too. I suggest the loot be used to finance an exhibit entitled how the whites built America, despite the drain of welfare and crime imposed on them by Henry&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
<p>Henry, you know you would contribute more to society as a janitor than as a &#8220;professor&#8221; of &#8220;black&#8221; studies for the increasingly irrelevant Harvard which pays no taxes to the cities of Boston and Cambridge upon whose valuable land it squats.</p>

		<p>Clearly now we need our own museum, and if, as it seems, we can&rsquo;t get the handcuffs, perhaps we can get the can of mace or the nightstick or the badge or the gun of the officer who arrested Gates - and get that into our museum.

		<p>While it&rsquo;s patently obvious why Gates donated the cuffs,(however he came into possession of them) what&rsquo;s less clear is why the Smithsonian accepted them. Whites couldn&rsquo;t care less about seeing them, and blacks already know full well what handcuffs look like from having worn them, however briefly, following their acts of violence and stupidity  &mdash;  usually perpetuated upon whites. </p>

		<p>In my department, officers have to PURCHASE their own equipment.  I think that&rsquo;s standard.  How did Gates come to have those cuffs?  </p>
<p>Therefore:<br>
a) Are they really the genuine article, used in the famous arrest, or fakes?<br>
or   &mdash;  <br>
b) If they are the real thing, how did he come into their possession?  Was he in illegal possession of property not his own?  How can he give away what is not his?</p>
