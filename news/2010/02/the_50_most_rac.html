	<p>Complex runs down the flicks that you might not have realized were wildly offensive. Turn on your racist radars, people!</p>
<p>1. Breakfast At Tiffany&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Year: 1961</p>
<p>In the history of inexplicable Hollywood racism, <cite>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s</cite> takes the m************ rice cake. Nobody would&rsquo;ve noticed had director Blake Edwards removed the random, inconsequential character of Mr. Yunioshi, gold digging Holly Golightly&rsquo;s bumbling, annoying Japanese neighbor, but there he is, sticking out like the two-inch buckteeth Mickey Rooney in yellowface sports to complete his look and ensure that the movie, like his portrayal, is ah-so disrespectfur.</p>

		<p>My least favorite movie on the other side of the spectrum is &#8220;A Perfect Storm&#8221;. In one of the opening scenes, the black fisherman is reunited with his blond haired, blue eyed girlfriend. That night, as the whole town celebrates at the bar, the lovely couple has sex in the upper level. Having sex rough enough to shake the light fixture above the bar, the whole town cheers them on. Nice family entertainment.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to make a movie that isn&rsquo;t racist without the exact proper mix of blacks, hispanics and all other races, to be determined by a specially-appointed committee that keeps up (or tries to) with the constantly-changing rules. That&rsquo;s life in the new &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; police state of the USSA. Life isn&rsquo;t going to be easy for whites, however, because if a movie is all-white it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist,&#8221; and if it includes other races and they&rsquo;re not portrayed as sufficiently heroic, it&rsquo;s also &#8220;racist.&#8221; In other words, it&rsquo;s a game that whites can&rsquo;t win.</p>

		<p> I managed to work my way through 1 through 12, then couldn&rsquo;t take any more of Complex Magazine&rsquo;s simple-minded P.C. rants. &#8220;Song of the South,&#8221; to mention one, is a wonderful, warm movie for which the Uncle Remus actor, James Baskett, received a special academy award. &#8220;The Passion of the Christ&#8221; is one of the most moving films I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p> Complex seems to have   &mdash;   well, a COMPLEX, about anything that calls attention to the fact that, yes, we&rsquo;re all God&rsquo;s chillun, but we&rsquo;re very different, one from another.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t put it better than the commenter who said it&rsquo;s laughable that the list didn&rsquo;t include any Spike Lee movies, for their depictions of whites and blacks.</p>
<p>The list itself is racist for assuming that racism only applies to african americans, chinese/japanese, and latino people. </p>
<p>Recent movies with a negative portrayal of whites include Gran Torino, Crossing Over, and The Blind Side.</p>
<p>The only movie that&rsquo;s racist again caucasians is White Chicks? Get Real.</p>

<p>I certainly didn&rsquo;t know that!</p>
<p>But I do know that some blacks like to believe that everyone who isn&rsquo;t specifically Northern European is &#8220;black&#8221;.  And some others even insist that anyone who isn&rsquo;t a blue-eyed blond is really and truly, deep down, &#8220;black&#8221;&hellip; we just don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>A woman I worked with (whose daughter went off to college and came back with all these &#8220;educated&#8221; notions) informed me that if you&rsquo;re not white, you&rsquo;re black. Thus, for them, the world is divided into two kinds: whites and blacks.  I asked her what about the Chinese?  She said they&rsquo;re black too.   I&rsquo;m sure that would be news to a lot of Chinese!</p>

		<p>I just ran through all 50 movies and had to laugh that anybody saw racism in them.  It&rsquo;s just that some people will see racism everywhere, under every rock and around every corner.  I&rsquo;m surprised that my very favorite movie wasn&rsquo;t part of this stupid list &#8220;Gone With the Wind.&#8221;  Really, how much more racist can you get than when Vivian Leigh (Scarlett slaps simpleton Prissy - the slave girl) across the face because she lied that she knew how to birth a baby.  How can you get more racist than that?  </p>

		<p>It is amazing how many anti-white films didn&rsquo;t make the list.  The film, Hurricane, has a racist, white cop who frames Hurricane.  The only problem was that he didn&rsquo;t exist in real life.  How about the new Honeymooners having a black casts?  The list is endless.  There hasn&rsquo;t been a black criminal in decades and all whites are either inbreds, stupid, racist or a combination of all 3.</p>

		<p>Ugh, I remember renting &#8220;The Brave One&#8221; because it looked like it might have something akin to race-consciousness in it.  It did, of course, but not for the white heroine.  Her fiance was Indian (there was a lovely, extended sex scene that displayed the difference in their skin tones to full advantage).  The good, brave, upstanding cop is black.  And while she does cap 5 or so minority men who are trying to harm her, she&rsquo;s seen as a fugitive.  Someone taking the law into her own hands   &mdash;   a menace!</p>
<p>Clever advertising for the film though.  Trick the white audiences into watching something that looks like one of our own is standing up for themselves, then blast them with as many multicult values as possible.</p>

I&rsquo;ve read the clips and he never goes into any detail about black actors playing &#8216;race stereotype&rsquo; roles. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see which films he deems not racist and what characters black actors play. I want to know exactly what black characters merit non-racist status. I suspect there are very few since all characters represent a group so any one actor and any one characters is a stereotype. I&rsquo;m just curious as to which black stereotype he believes is acceptable in films.</p>
<p>As for most racist movies, The Matrix series is one of worst anti-white movies ever made.</p>
<p>Everyone evil is white. (They even go so far as to hammer this point home by using albinos.) Everyone who is good is multi-racial and multi-cultural.</p>

		<p>Robin Hood and his Merry Men have been made famous worldwide by Kevin Costner and Hollywood. Quite apart from the fact that Costner&rsquo;s hero managed to ride the 250 kilometers from the south coast of England to Sherwood Forest in Nottingham in just a few hours (a feat that had most of the English filmgoers laughing), the myths and tales of Robin Hood we tell today are somewhat removed from the original historical facts.  According to some very old ballads, Robin came not from Nottingham but Yorkshire and about two centuries earlier than King Richard. Therefore, his adversary would not have been the sheriff of Nottingham, so masterly played by Alan Rickman. Nonetheless, the swashbuckling tale of the people&rsquo;s hero who robbed the rich to give to the poor and defied the local lord who over-taxed the people has a wonderful ring to it. The historical Robin Hood is so far back in time that apart from one translated source which suggests he could have been on the run for murder we cannot be sure about the truth. But it must be racist somehow as felons were hanged in those days and several movies show Robin Hood cutting the rope with an arrow even though the prisoner was a White man.</p>

		<p>When the &#8220;racist&#8221; Breakfast At Tiffany&rsquo;s was made in 1961, whites kept people who used words like m*********** out of their neighborhoods. Today, we are forced to listen to such language in our grocery stores, video rental stores, etc. Another strength of diversity.</p>

		<p>How about the movie &#8220;Deliverance&#8221;(1972), billed as an American Thriller. I would think that this gem of Hollywood, that has a  typical portrayal of Hollywood&rsquo;s view of the American South would qualify as racism towards whites. A group of friends, guys that don&rsquo;t live in the South, go deep into the Ozarks, because they heard of a river that has the greatest white water canoeing of any place. Instead of a great canoeing trip, the trip turns into a nightmare, when some &#8220;typical perverts&#8221; in the Ozarks(as Hollywood depicts them)sodomize and kill one of the guys as the others desperately try to find a way out. The whole movie is an attack against whites in this particular part of the country as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Of course it one all kinds of awards and is considered somehow, culturally important!!</p>

		<p>The creator of this list obviously never saw &#8220;The Pest&#8221; (1997) starring John Leguizamo.  It involves Pest turning into multiple different ethnicities at will along with the best stereotypes of each (&#8220;Free Angela Davis&#8221; says Pest&hellip;.&#8221;Who&rsquo;s Angela Davis&#8221; responds wealthy Black father).  Also #24 Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is my second favorite movie of all time!!</p>

		<p>One interesting film that made it on the list was Blackhawk Down. The reviewer is furious that blacks were portrayed forming mobs and attacking white people. Problem is, that movie was based on historical events. He might as well have said &#8220;facts are racist!&#8221;</p>
