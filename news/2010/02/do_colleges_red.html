	<p>SAT SCORES aren&rsquo;t everything. But they can tell some fascinating stories.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade, who reviewed data from 10 elite colleges, writes in &#8220;No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal&#8221; that Asian applicants typically need an extra 140 points to compete with white students. In fact, according to Princeton lecturer Russell Nieli, there may be an &#8220;Asian ceiling&#8221; at Princeton, a number above which the admissions office refuses to venture.</p>
<p>Emily Aronson, a Princeton spokeswoman, insists &#8220;the university does not admit students in categories. In the admission process, no particular factor is assigned a fixed weight and there is no formula for weighing the various aspects of the application.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few years ago, however, when I worked as a reader for Yale&rsquo;s Office of Undergraduate Admissions, it became immediately clear to me that Asians  &mdash;  who constitute 5 percent of the US population  &mdash;  faced an uphill slog. They tended to get excellent scores, take advantage of AP offerings, and shine in extracurricular activities. Frequently, they also had hard-knock stories: families that had immigrated to America under difficult circumstances, parents working as kitchen assistants and store clerks, and households in which no English was spoken.</p>
<p>But would Yale be willing to make 50 percent of its freshman class Asian? Probably not.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Princeton&rsquo;s Nieli suggests, most elite universities appear determined to keep their Asian-American totals in a narrow range. Yale&rsquo;s class of 2013 is 15.5 percent Asian-American, compared with 16.1 percent at Dartmouth, 19.1 percent at Harvard, and 17.6 percent at Princeton.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a country built on individual liberty and promise, that feels deeply unfair. If a teenager spends much time studying, excels at an instrument or sport, and garners wonderful teacher recommendations, should he be punished for being part of a high-achieving group? Are his accomplishments diminished by the fact that people he has never met  &mdash;  but who look somewhat like him  &mdash;  also work hard?</p>
<p>{snip} But Poon [Oiyan Poon, the 2007 president of the University of California Students Association], now a research associate at the University of Massachusetts Boston, warns that there are downsides to having huge numbers of Asian-Americans on a campus.</p>
<p>In California, where passage of a 1996 referendum banned government institutions from discriminating on the basis of race, Asians make up about 40 percent of public university students, though they account for only 13 percent of residents. &#8220;Some Asian-American students feel that they lost something by going to school at a place where almost half of their classmates look like themselves  &mdash;  a campus like UCLA. The students said they didn&rsquo;t feel as well prepared in intercultural skills for the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what do you do if you&rsquo;re an elite college facing tremendous numbers of qualified Asian applicants? At the 2006 meeting of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, a panel entitled &#8220;Too Asian?&#8221; looked at the growing tendency of teachers, college counselors, and admissions officers to see Asians as a unit, rather than as individuals.</p>

		<p> Pat Buchanan noted in two articles- one was entitled &#8220;The Dispossession of Christian Americans&#8221; back around the turn of the Millenium(Nov1999 to Jan. 2000) that blacks got 8% of admission slots back then at Harvard and Yale due to affirmative action, while being 13% of the U. S. population, Hispanics, 7% and 11%(they are now 14% of the population). Asians, 3% of the population then, got 20% of the slots, and Jews, 2.5% of the population, got a whopping 33.3% of the admission slots. White gentiles, then at least 65% of the population, got approximately 25% of the slots, and were therefore the least  represented demographic compared to their incidence in the population. I doubt that this has changed.  We&rsquo;re caught in a pincers movement between affirmative action for low performing minorities on one hand, and overrepresentation for high performing minorities on the other. Think of it-approximately 5% of the population gets over 50% of the admission slots at the colleges deemed &#8220;the breeding stables of America&rsquo;s leadership&#8221;. Shows you who is and who isn&rsquo;t going to be leading America in the future, doesn&rsquo;t it? Why do we put up with getting the squeeze-no one else does!</p>

		<p>If Asians are being discriminated against by colleges they have no one to blame but themselves. </p>
<p>After all, for decades their leaders have supported affirmative action, quotas and the Democratic Party. They also opposed Ward Connerly, a good man whose fight against race-based college admission quotas have hugely helped Californian Orientals.  </p>

		<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to remark on is I walk by the Stuyvesant High School(the most elite Public School in NYC) area and see mostly Asians.  </p>
<p>Also The Bell Curve made much of the very real fact that an elite is forming in society along the lines of IQ. If this book wasn&rsquo;t so harshly criticized much could be learned from it.</p>
<p>Finally, as much as I can admire ability and hard work, we do not need to be ethnically cleansed by anyone. A moratorium on all immigration is sorely needed. </p>

		<p>I say we need to go back to allowing sheer ability to be the rule on which admissions to a university are based.  A 4 year college or university is NOT the place for people who need remedial classes; it is the place for the most intelligent and most able students to gather together and learn.  Students who can&rsquo;t cut the mustard need to go to JC&rsquo;s (community colleges) and vocational &#8220;colleges;&#8221; places like DeVry University have produced a huge number of skilled, qualified workers who go on to make big bucks in the workaday world.  There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.  College/university is NOT for everyone.  If we get honest and allow pure ability to determine admissions, then the quality of our graduates will automatically go UP and the dropout rate will go DOWN.  And, people will be placed in schools according to their proper ability level, and the vast majority will be a lot happier in the long run.  That&rsquo;s how it used to be here, and always was in Europe.  We need to go back to that system.</p>

		<p>Today, Whites comprise only 27% of UC Irvine&rsquo;s undergrads and 22% of graduate students.  In reality, many of these are actually Iranians and other &#8220;White&#8221; Middle Easterners, and hence the percentage of actual European-Americans is even lower. </p>
<p>Note that European Americans built LA and the UC University system, and are at this very moment not only giving both away to foreigners, but are ecstatic while doing so, because they can claim &#8220;Oh the diversity in California is so wonderful!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Folks, we are literally giving away our nation   &mdash;   our childrens&rsquo; future.  If UC Irvine is already 75% non-European, imagine what it will be in just one more generation.  </p>

		<p>Discriminated against? Asians? What a laugh. A large chunk of ones who attend college here are from out of country and that&rsquo;s not including the immigrant population who don&rsquo;t truly assimlate. If anything they are overrepresented since they are either not residents or native born. <br>
It&rsquo;s also a myth that all these Asians are studious genius. I know first hand how they would cheat like in math class passing test papers to each other while the teacher was oblivious or simply didn&rsquo;t care.  That was back in high school 15 years ago. <br>
Live around them. Work with them. Go to class with them. They are not the &#8220;model minority&#8221;.   </p>

<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s a <b>big</b> difference.  The &#8220;powers that were&#8221;  intended to maintain and advance their native culture, not destroy it.</p>
<p>Universities have always considered &#8220;other factors besides academic achievement&#8221; since their founding in medieval times, religious piety and character chief among them.  (How many Asians, Jews or blacks do you see at Brigham Young or Baylor, or, until recently, Notre Dame?)</p>
<p>Puritan Elis, Crimson, etc., had every right to discriminate in favor of their &#8220;legacies&#8221;.  Jews and other new arrivals were free to found their own institutions, which, to their credit, some did, e.g. Brandeis and Yeshiva.</p>
<p>Are there <i>any</i> Asian-founded colleges in this country?  Besides that Maharishi-thingy in Iowa, that is?</p>

		<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t say anything about how many points the SAT scores of whites must exceed those of blacks and Hispanics in order to get admitted.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s at least 140 points.  So cry me a river.</p>
<p>Most Asians in this country vote for Democrats so they have no right to complain about the Democrats&rsquo; program of systematic discrimination against the competent.<br>

		<p>Actually, Asians are favored over White students when other factors are equal. In fact, &#8216;minorities&rsquo;, people classified as such, even if they are White, are favored over &#8216;plain&rsquo; old Whites when it comes to college admissions. Over 15 years one WN writer broke down admissions to prestigious universities around the country and found that E. Asians and Ashkenazi Jews for instance were admitted to Harvard at about three times the rate they would be if grades and test scores were the only criteria. Even with the amount of time these groups spend studying, and slightly higher average IQ scores, it doesn&rsquo;t explain the admissions rates ( https://tinyurl.com/yjhlbkx). Same goes for blacks, hispanics, you name it. the situation is worse now than when the author penned his article on anti-White admissions practices in colleges. </p>
<p>The flip side for Asians is that their success in some areas has been shown to be beyond what IQ for example would predict. That&rsquo;s where hard work comes in. Unfortunately, in other areas, it&rsquo;s merely a demonstration of anti-White policies via affirmative action. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re missing the point? &#8216;Affirmative action&rsquo; policies of yesteryear are being used as reasons to use the punishment&rsquo; and shame of affirmative action today. Even after restrictions were placed on Jews, they were still vastly overrepresented as a share of the student population. So 50 years from now, if history is any guide, whites will still be at the bottom of the affirmative action ladder, because those evil white men discriminated against Asians in 2010. </p>

		<p>I think some of the issues are being ignored. These elite universities should primarily admit students on the basis of their abilities and intellect. If they are primarily of Asian descent, so be it. These top students would ultimately help American society in the long run with hard work and scientific breakthroughs. They are Americans, too. At the same time, I have no problem with legacy admits or applicants with somewhat lower test scores if they have any number of non-quantifiable attributes so long as they too are qualified. I don&rsquo;t think the difference between a M/V SAT of 1540 vs. 1410 is that big of a deal. Let&rsquo;s face it - you don&rsquo;t need to be a genius to get a degree from these places - most good students would have no problem. The real issue is when an Asian or Jewish or legacy applicant or whoever with 1500 SATs and a top 5% class ranking is denied a spot which is then given to a black with a 940 SAT and 11th grade writing skills. This is the true disgrace.    </p>

		<p>I find this very amusing because I happen to go to a UC. About a year or two ago, they advocated abolishing the SAT subject tests in order to reduce the number of Asian students. Despite the fact that Asians are grossly overrepresented, they want to cry foul because their numbers might decrease. Meanwhile, whites, who are about 60% of the national population, are expected to sit back and smile when we are barely over 20% at various universities. I mean, after all, since we will always be successful because of our &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; and have historically been the dominant group, we&rsquo;re expected to suck it up. For Asians who don&rsquo;t like policies that seek to reduce their numbers, perhaps their intellectuals and leaders shouldn&rsquo;t have supported affirmative action so passionately.</p>
<p>Seriously, when are white people finally going to stop dozing off and wake up? As a white nationalist, I hate to say this, but at times I cannot help but think that whites deserve to be wiped out. After all, is a race that refuses to fight for its interests and assert themselves worthy of survival? Why should we expect non-whites to respect western/white civilization when we ourselves won&rsquo;t respect what our ancestors built? What do we have to be proud of when our ancestral homelands are being overrun by alien invaders, and even worse, our European brothers and sisters aren&rsquo;t even willing to entertain the notion that they are the native peoples of their land? </p>
<p>If we whites are not willing to fight for our interests, we are not worthy of survival and prosperity. Unless the vast majority of whites, and not just a few white nationalists, begin to cultivate racial consciousness, we are doomed. Part of this activism and consciousness will entail ending this &#8220;diversity&#8221; madness.</p>

		<p>You know, the salvation of this nation is goihg to be the brains, not the brawn, of its citizens.  I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is with Asians and Jews - I&rsquo;ve taught both, and they make wonderful students.  They learn quickly and retain what they learn - you don&rsquo;t have to spend time reviewing with them.  White kids who can keep up with them, more power to &#8216;em; in fact, members of ANY group that can keep up with the Asians and the Jews, these are the people we WANT in America!  For me this is really a &#8220;class&#8221; issue, class based on intelligence and ability that is, rather than race or religion, money or possessions.  It&rsquo;s &#8220;Do you have the brains or not?&#8221;  If you don&rsquo;t, then go to a learning situation that is better suited to your abilities.  If you DO, then we need to welcome you into our highest institutions of learning.  YES it&rsquo;s elitist   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what it SHOULD be.  Anybody who is too dumb to realize this had better get ready for a shock - guess what!!  It is no accident that the cream rises to the top.  It&rsquo;ll happen regardless of the different machinations of societal doogooders.  Watch and see.</p>

		<p>More altruistic madness. Of course there should be a ceiling for Asian students at US Universities. Imagine if US students swamped Chinese or Indian campuses? There would be uproar. Asian and foreign students use their new gained US skills and then use them against the US. Most of Asia&rsquo; business, medical and research elite have been trained in the US, they have bascially stolen Western secrets at bargain prices.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to me that America is in store for a similar future that we in Australia have felt we&rsquo;re in for for some time now - that Asians are going to represent a sizable proportion of our elite ruling class in the near future which will expand exponentially in future generations as Asian migration continues, and indeed most likely increases.</p>
<p>I respect the fact that they make the most of opportunities given to them, unlike other ethnic groups, but ultimately it&rsquo;s the same old story of importing non-whites to take over our countries in place of our own sons and daughters who should be given that hard-fought-for right.</p>

		<p>A number of schools discriminate against whites in favor of asians and other so called &#8216;minorities&#8221;.  Thomas Jefferson High School, a magnet public school in the Washington DC area has the highest acceptance rates for blacks and hispanics, the next highest for asians, and whites are dead last.  It should be noted that these acceptance percentages are after the first cut that leaves only the best students in a pool for consideration.  </p>
<p>In public meetings with parents, the school claims that extra-curricular activities are important factors in admission.  This should favor whites (how many black and asian kids are involved in Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and volunteer activities - zilch).  In reality, the student&rsquo;s ethnic background is visible in every stage of the admission process and again the white applicants are eliminated resulting in them having the lowest admission percentage.</p>
<p>Oh yes, in these meetings Thomas Jefferson High School has stated it is committed to &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  I wonder how this is implimented in a zero-sum game of admissions&hellip;hmmmm?</p>
<p>A very well researched article (below) was written by Dr. Lloyd Cohen whose bright childen were eliminated in the admissions process.  Things have gotten worse since this article was written.</p>

		<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been known for some time that Northeast Asians have measurably higher average IQs than Caucasians.  Combine this factor with their ability to focus on long-term objectives, work tirelessly for long periods, defer gratification, and you have a group of high achievers.  While there is some evidence that caucasians are just as well (or better) represented among those with super high IQs and strong levels of creativity, I&rsquo;d say East Asians are odds-on favorites to become the dominant race on earth in the 21st Century.</p>

		<p>16 John: While I have never doubted that Orientals are roughly as smart as Whites, I don&rsquo;t buy the line that they are smarter.  Average White and American Black IQs are calculated from tens, maybe hundreds of millions of tests given in schools and the military over the last hundred years.  All the dull-witted are included, from the urban ghettos to the White suburbs to the country hollows.  But we have no such data base for Orientals.  Those who live in the U.S. are not at all typical, and we have no idea about the billion peasants in China.  And while I&rsquo;m sure that the Japanese government knows just how smart their people are, they&rsquo;re not about to fill us in on how many dullards are among them.  In fact, there was a posting here some time ago about how the Japanese faked the results when the American Occupation authorities first tested their kids, as part of our program to Americanize their schools.  <br>
     Most of us haven&rsquo;t the means to check on most of what we are told, so we have to check new information against our experience and knowledge.  We&rsquo;re told that Blacks are our equals, and don&rsquo;t believe it because it doesn&rsquo;t match what we see.  So when I&rsquo;m told that Orientals are smarter than Whites, I want to know how come the less intelligent race created the modern, scientific world.  </p>

		<p>As some posters have noted, not all Asians are top achievers.  I live in a major urban area in a neighborhood that is FAST becoming Chinese and Korean.  Here is what I have observed:</p>
<p>#1 Most Asians are nice and have reasonably good manners, but&hellip;</p>
<p>#2 Most I have seen have a cognitive disconnect with reality.  They often don&rsquo;t seem to be aware of their surroundings whether walking down the street, driving a car, being in the middle of a maelstrom and failing to notice, etc&hellip;  This may sound comic, but nearly every Asian I have known and been friends with my entire life has had &#8216;something missing&rsquo; up there.  Hard work is a given, but they cannot seem to connect the dots, and this may be reflected in the fact that in Asian countries, they still mostly just copy technology whites invent over here.</p>
<p>#3  A large, very large chunck of Asian youths are, ahem, getting corrupted into the gangsta, hip hop lifestlye.  You see these useless Asian teenagers dressing like ghetto punks - I even witnessed once a hard working Korean immigrant mother chewing out her useless son about his bad grades and stupid behavior.  Give&rsquo;em a generation and the joys of diversity will corrupt most of the Asian youth.  (I have also seen a lot of really corrupted youth from India, as well.)</p>
<p>#4  I am really looking forward to this coming fight: Asians, as you may be aware, do not give blacks the time of day.  I mean, Asians do not even acknowledge black people at all.  They will hire Hispanics for dishwashing and such, but they absolutely do not associate with them either in any way, shape or form.  When we whites are really pushed down and impoverished, and the social justice crowd can&rsquo;t squeeze any more money from us to support the blacks and illegal hispanics, they will have no choice but to go after the Asians and Middleeasterners next.  Oh, boy do I want to see that!  Asians will be a brick wall for them!  Asians do not want &#8216;integration&rsquo; with blacks and hispanics.  They do not want to share money with the lazy.  That is going to be something to see.</p>

		<p>From my first hand experience with Chinese and Indian students who attend high end math and science programs along with my white children is that they are politically oriented to the left, along with their parents.  One Chinese kid that my son knows is very anti-western, and anti-white.</p>
<p>Cheating is also rampant in Asian cultures and that is also a factor in their success in school, although many work hard too.  Many Indians in the United States take advantage of the SBA&rsquo;s &#8220;8A&#8221; program that discriminates against whites.  They will fight for preferences for their respective ethnic groups, and we are stupid enough to give those to them.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if these Asian groups obtain power they will have no mercy for whites, regardless of how polite they are now.  This would be entirely consistent with their treatment of non-Asian groups in their native lands.  Other qualities of Western Civilization such as freedom of speech and expression will be severly curtailed.  Corruption will become an accepted part of society.</p>
<p>Whites who fantasize that globalism will result in some sort of &#8220;free market&#8221; utopia (such as GW Bush, the Wall Street Journal, and the neo-conservatives) are just idealistic fools, or are have just sold out for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>Again, the Asians will have no mercy for whites if they gain power, absolutely none.<br>

		<p>Since most east Asians are politically left-of-center and have supported racial quotas in the past, some of them must understand the hypocrisy behind their complaint against university admission caps for them.</p>
<p>A university degree is not all it is cracked up to be, anyway.  Bill Gates is not going to hire an American citizen - Asian or otherwise - as a software engineer when he can get a cheap H-1b.  All a university degree means is that you will graduate with a mountain of student loan debt that even bankruptcy will not alleviate, you will be waiting tables or delivering pizza, and the corporate fat-cats will be using the money they&rsquo;ve saved by not hiring you to bribe congress into giving them more H-1bs.</p>

<p>Ok fine, would you be &#8220;better prepared for the real world&#8221; by taking a blue collar job, and giving up your hard earned university slot to a sulky ungrateful black student who just enrolls in &#8220;Black Studies&#8221; classes, and shows up to those everyone-gets-an-A, feel good, hate whitey/Jew/Asian, frothing at the mouth, black pather tirade sessions, just enough to maintain that 2.0 GPA and keep the gravy train of Student loans (which will be defaulted on) flowing for at least a year or two?</p>
<p>Why do we need &#8220;intercultural skills&#8221; anyway?  I work in an office building with white collar professionals of a similar background to my own. I encounter different cultures for twenty minutes on the train, during which time my face is buried in a book, and then ignore them for the rest of my day. If anything colleges should focus less on how to relate to &#8220;disadvantaged minorities&#8221; and more to training people on network with and interact with other people of your own socio economic status.<br>

		<p>I have to disagree with John regarding Asians being the dominant group in the 21st century. There success outside academic areas, while very good, is not as great as inside. As another poster noted, Asian success is also greater than what IQ scores alone would predict (and in fact N. European IQ averages are about the same as E. Asians, but the structure is different). Asians do much better in white societies, just like everyone else. There is something innate, apparently, in almost all non-white groups that keeps them from matching whites in certain areas. Genetic engineering might change that down the line. But not right away. All whites need to do to improve their academic &#8216;rating&rsquo; is to take their culture back. Current SAT scores, even at the top, are actually lower on average than what was being acheived 45 - 50 years ago etc by whites. The essay was added to the SAT to allow the anointed groups to earn higher scores. If they can work into their essay their tough life as an Asian, black, latino, gay, etc in the horrible USA they will earn a terrific score. Yes, it&rsquo;s that bad. </p>

		<p>trueredwhite&blue;, while I agree that ability should be the primary determining factor for college admissions, I believe there should be others.  And I&rsquo;m not sure that being a devoted grade-grubber since pre-K, and learning how to play &#8216;an instrument&rsquo;, have anything to do with &#8216;ability&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A great many brilliant people, who go on to contribute key innovations to Civilization, have always been mediocre students.  White, indigenous Europeans, lag behind Asians and Jews in sheer IQ and grades, but obviously possess other mental gifts which more than compensate.  It would be a pity to see Europeans largely shunted off toward becoming plumbers and electricians, because they were more interested in what they could do with knowledge, than how far they could get within the system by exploiting grades and &#8216;extracurriculars&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the subject of our displacement, however, I think now would be a good moment to suggest that men whose IQs are below 120, and who possess no other exceptional traits, consider using a (blond Scandinavian) sperm donor, whose IQ is north of 150.  Why not give your offspring (and your race) every advantage?</p>

		<p>Poster #30. What you said in the last paragraph is insane. Why bother working to support yourself if you are raising someone else&rsquo;s offspring. Your stance is the flip side of the coin of anti-whites. <br>
What&rsquo;s going on is simple. Americans are being replaced by a foreign group. Who cares if they are smart. Who goes around educating ones enemy? You don&rsquo;t really believe most of them see us as one of their own. They hate us.<br>
Ever heard of avian brood parasites? These birds lay their eggs in the nest of other birds usually of a different species who then raise the offspring of the invader often resulting in the displacement and death of the host&rsquo;s eggs.  <br>

<p>In my view, Asians are perfectly nice people, and I greatly respect their many fine qualities.  However, that does not mean that I want my people to be replaced by Chinese, Koreans &amp; Japanese.  Each of those ethnic groups have their own country. Try to go to any of those Asian countries and suggest that they should be replaced by Whites, Africans, and Hispanics, and see what sort of response you get.  Why the double standard?  </p>

		<p>Do you really want to know why Asians do better than anyone else? The secret is that they study harder than other kids. Asian parents instill the value of an education to their children. Asian parents will do anything to get their kids into top schools. This is true in Asia as it is in the US. In Japan, parents send their kids to cram schools so that they can pass the entrance exams to the best universitites in the country. In the US, Asian parents spend money to have their kids attend SAT/ACT prep courses so that they can do well on the college entrance exams. How many parents of other races do the same?</p>

		<p>East Asians have assimilated well to Anglo-America. Though most of us agree with Frank Salter&rsquo;s thesis that states work best when they contain a citizenry of a single ethnicity, it is nevertheless true that the U.S. has already moved beyond that. Our elite is a cosmopolitan elite: WASP, Catholic, Jewish, East and South Asian, and a smattering from almost everywhere. We can&rsquo;t turn back the clock. What we can do is to prevent the undeserving from gaining admittance to the elite through political finagling  &mdash;  we can work to end affirmative action. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;extra 140 points to compete with white students.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   quotation from the article.</p>
<p>Only 140 points?</p>
<p>I say we should raise the bar by 500 points or more (or whatever it takes to balance the racial representation within colleges and universities across our great country).  Furthermore, colleges and universities should implement a system of having their professors keep separate grading books: one for Asians, the other for non-Asians.  At every step of their education, the system should raise the bar higher for Asians and keep the bar normalized for everyone else.  Be unfair at every step!</p>
<p>Of course, are we prepared for the consequences?</p>
<p>Suppose we have two university graduates: one is of Asian descent and the other is non-Asian.  The prospective employer would certainly know what the educational environment was like for each of these graduates.  Which one do you think the employer would hire first?</p>
<p>I actually suffered through such a hypothetical system   &mdash;   and I am glad and very proud that I did.</p>
<p>In my life (so far), I have had to lie only once: it was on my university application.  In the upper right hand corner of the application was the typical question regarding race.  I was EXTREMELY tempted to claim that I was Caucasian (I could do it because my Sir name is spelled and pronounced like a very common Irish name, and my Christian name is quite Anglo-Saxon in origin).  I decided to check the box marked &#8220;Other&#8221; and entered nothing in the blank space beside it.</p>
<p>I was later caught, by none other than an Asian girl student.  She acted as if I assassinated the President.  I had already been accepted officially and was going through the typical university orientation process, but she took the liberty of finding my application package and marking certain documents with corrections.  Many years later, I occasionally recollect this incident and wonder if what she had done was even legal to do.</p>
<p>Nothing bad happened that I could directly attribute to my falsified university application.  Can you imagine if the university tried to expel me based on THAT question?  I think it would have been entertaining to go through such a legal proceeding, had I been actually charged with a crime.</p>
<p>After my first year (and making Freshman honor roll), I had a job interview with a very prominent U.S. Government institution (Yes, a job interview after one year of university).  This was going to be a very special once-in-lifetime interview   &mdash;   the offer of all expenses paid, plus salary, plus other perquisites for just going to a university was just too intriguing to ignore.  I decided to implement a test to see if my falsified university application had any negative consequences.</p>
<p>I surmised that my interviewer was going to be in official U.S. Government attire; therefore, he was going to be easy to spot.  By my best estimation, I believed my interviewer was going to make some rather incorrect assumptions, and in addition, my interviewer was not going to bother with doing some minimal homework before this interview.  The game to be played was to see if I could get &#8220;the jump on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I arrived to the career center a few minutes early, spotted him, then proceeded to loiter around him.  I was the only student at the career center at that time.  I read the advertisements on the wall.  I even asked him for the time.  I loitered some more and again asked him for the time.  At the top of the hour, I swung around, beemed a bright smile, and in a confident, perhaps slightly loud voice, I said, &#8220;Hi, I am here to be interviewed!&#8221;</p>
<p>You could practically see the steam coming out of him.</p>
<p>It should be obvious to everyone that I had no intention of passing that interview (strangely enough, I did receive multiple requests for more interviews   &mdash;   I ignored them).</p>
<p>The point of that story was a person can get really embarrassed over his own preconceived notions.</p>
<p>The intended effect of excluding people by raising the standard for those people may have the unintended effect of actually making those people stronger; therefore, I am very much in favor of &#8220;unfairly&#8221; raising the bar.</p>

		<p>Having worked in Asian countries I would say the issue of Asians being smarter is talked up perhaps more than it should be. They put a ridiculous amount of time and effort into preparing for and taking tests, they memorize and study harder rather than smarter, and those who have their education back in their Asian countries show little of the creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship those who have a western education do. When they get their education in the west this obviously changes somewhat, but in my opinion merely comes down to them &#8216;out-studying&rsquo; whites more than anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&rsquo;s been known for some time that Northeast Asians have measurably higher average IQs than Caucasians. Combine this factor with their ability to focus on long-term objectives, work tirelessly for long periods, defer gratification, and you have a group of high achievers. While there is some evidence that caucasians are just as well (or better) represented among those with super high IQs and strong levels of creativity, I&rsquo;d say East Asians are odds-on favorites to become the dominant race on earth in the 21st Century&#8221;.</p>
<p>My Grandparents were born in Harbin and Darin, China of Russian stock. In the 1920&rsquo;s Chinese were considered dumb, children didn&rsquo;t go to school nor did have have any intelligence that could be seen according to my grandparents. They were raised in simple peasant families with no elctricity, no schools, no hospitas and low IQ&rsquo;s. The reason IQ scores have slipped in the West is due primarily to third world immigration and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Asians are not creative and prefer to tow the line. Look around and the world we see and live in is Western even asian countries are Western today. It is Asians who copy us not the other way around. Europeans invented ELECTRICITY, CAR, BIKE, COMPUTER, RADIO, TV, CIVIL SOCIETY, MEDICINE, LAW, MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE AND AEROPLANE ETC ETC. Asians do not compare with Europeans, Europeans are streets ahead in intelligence.</p>
<p>East Asians will never be the dominant race. Japan has the fastest ageing population in the world, hopeless economy, world&rsquo;s largest Govt. debt and highest suicide rate. Korea was a hermit kingdom until the Americans went in and rescued their pathetic ass. The Koreans had nothing until the Americans arrived. Korea also has massive Govt. debt and no internal domestic engine, relying on overseas consumption.</p>
<p>China is way over-rated. According to the UN, 17 out of the 20 dirtiest cities are in the world are located in China. China is killing itself. The Gobi desert is advancing, Beijing is covered in dust and sandstorms half the year and the Shanghai delta is sinking and one of the most polluted areas on earth. The inequality gap between rich and poor is widening, too reliant on overseas consumption and a whopping 20% of China&rsquo;s population are considered illiterate. I would like to go to rural China and do some IQ tests. China and asian countries are reknowned for their cheating and lies.</p>
<p>India, Bangladesh, Phillippines, Malaysia and Indonesia all have low IQ&rsquo;s and they are asian. Anyway most asians in Western countrie are either sex workers, cleaners, restaurant workers, factory workers or in menial jobs.</p>
<p>Here in Australia, asians control the heroin and ice trade. Schools with high percentages of asians have higher crime rates and more gang problems. Asians are not model students as they lie, cheat and pay their way through. Universities in Australia have lowered their standards to accomodate these delinquents. </p>

<p>By the way most asian countries are diverse. Japan is starting to be swamped by third world workers. HK and Singapore are also melting pots. Indonesia and Phillippines are very ethnically and tribally diverse.</p>
<p>Our Labor/Democrat govts. are intent on total destruction of our economies. They want to usher in the NWO. This nightmare is just around the corner and I guarantee you it is not orchestated by asians but by whites. Whites will always be in control, let&rsquo;s just wait and see.</p>

because, they seem to do a lot better than their counterparts in their Asian homelands&hellip; Some of those countries are quite poor, and the children there sometimes suffer from malnutrition, and score rather poorly on IQ tests.</p>
<p>Could this whole &#8220;Asian IQ&#8221; thing be a liberal lie, part of a propaganda used to displace Whites in their homelands?</p>
