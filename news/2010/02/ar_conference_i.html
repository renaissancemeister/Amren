<h1>AR Conference is Canceled   &mdash;   Again</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, Feb. 17, 2010.</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This message was sent to all conference registrants at 7:00 p.m. today.</p>
<p>Dear AR Conference Registrant,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that at 6:30 pm today, February 17, the Capitol Skyline hotel, which had promised to withstand pressure, canceled the conference. </p>
<p>We informed the hotel of all circumstances surround the previous cancellations, including death threats, and the hotel still agreed to hold the conference. We had every reason to believe it would hold firm. We feel just as betrayed as you do.</p>
<p>We will be in touch later to discuss how to handle refunds of conference registrations and other matters.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jared Taylor<br>

		<p>We have got to do something about this. We have absolutely no one taking our side in this disgraceful episode   &mdash;   not one prominent journalist (Buchanan, O&rsquo;Reilly, etc.), not one mainstream news organ. I&rsquo;m telling you, we have got to put together some kind of organized boycott of these hotels. If it&rsquo;s true what we believe, that we truly speak for the majority, then we have got to do this now. Let them feel our anger and retribution.</p>

<p>Just a thought. Could we get our own Fed/State Government (up to and including the local National Guard Commander) to back down from death threats?   </p>

		<p>I would not have published the name of the new hotel at all.  It seems to me that the best policy would have been to select a venue and then, as each guest arrives in the area, he/she calls to find out where it is.</p>
<p>The brown-shirts obviously believe that through violence and intimidation they can silence us.  What they might not realize is that such persecution only strengthens our resolve to be yet more aggressive in spreading the truth.  As for me, I&rsquo;m already outspoken about race realism with those I meet and on line.  Now I&rsquo;m thinking, &#8220;what else can I do to open people&rsquo;s minds?&#8221;.  One idea is to approach school kids, on their way to school or back, and nicely tell the white ones to feel good about being white.  A bull horn might come in useful.  Let them know that white pride is a good thing.  I might visit another area, where young people frequent, and pass out fliers with the simple message that science supports the biological fact of race.  Up until now, my bumper stickers have been rather tame.  Perhaps now they will be more to the point.  All 300 or so of you who planned on attending must replicate the above resolutions.  The same goes for those who did not plan on attending but took comfort in the conference - now you can take comfort no longer!  It is up to each and every one of us to use our freedom of speech while we still have it and push the facts in people&rsquo;s faces so that they can not ignore them.</p>
<p>When leftists hold their &#8220;race conferences&#8221; (and they do), we must organize and do unto them what they do unto us (by legal means of course).  We must organize in each city and town to organize protests.  I&rsquo;m in the Portland, OR area and I expect to hear from others around here; we must stay in touch.</p>
<p>As for those in charge at Amren, I hope you do pursue legal/civil charges against those terrorists.  I also hope that you schedule another conference, at a different location and take my advice: nobody knows where, exactly, it will be until that same day.  You don&rsquo;t even need to be honest about the approximate location ahead of time; we can take a little inconvenience.</p>

		<p>It seems that the only way to have this conference is covertly; that is, have a proxy make the arrangements under a fake organizational name, then contact participants immediately before the event. Sure it&rsquo;s dishonest and cowardly, but it&rsquo;s really the only way I see this happening. </p>

		<p>I hope that AmRen can extract concessions from all 4 hotels.  Every conference contract I have ever signed has held me to hefty penalties for any last-minute cancellations.</p>
<p>Also, I hope that AmRen will bring suit against all who interferred with its commercial enterprise.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Taylor understands the intensity of hate that is out there for him and what he is succeeding at.  There is a double standard because if some one were to disrupt a NAACP meeting the government would spend millions of dollars to track them down and imprison them.</p>
<p>The Conference should be held in a place other than the bastion of liberal hate mongers?  You need to go to a place where a person can legally carry a gun.  A place that is not easy to get to for liberal trouble makers.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is feasible but I would imagine a hotel in the middle of Wyoming or Utah that needs the money; or at least a city that is not dominated by PC idiots.  Also what about Northern Michigan or another cold spot in the winter or down South in the summer, they have air conditioning.   </p>
<p>There is no penalty if some one stops the Conference.  This must be changed.</p>

		<p>The American Renaissance conference is canceled? Perhaps next time it should be at a University, a place that should allow &#8220;free speech,&#8221; or if that doesn&rsquo;t work, the Everglades somewhere. The fact that any hotel would bar a conference of an organization espousing white racial pride is sickening and a sign that the truth is that more powerful - that white people have socially verifiable reasons to be prideful and that the showing that pride undermines the interests of the globalist elite who&rsquo;s only goal is to throw the world into feudalism, white nationalism be damned. Sobering, and sad. Perhaps as the country spirals more and more into the depths of multiculturalism, future hotels will reconsider hosting AmRen. Perhaps, things just aren&rsquo;t &#8220;bad&#8221; enough yet. That, and the power of the truth is the only good news that comes from an article like this.</p>

		<p>As someone who was registered for the conference, I was looking forward to being &#8220;among the living&#8221; again.  It is heartbreaking that we do not have freedom of speech in this country.</p>
<p>Would it be possible for the speakers to record or publish the remarks that they would have made at the conference? </p>

		<p>Why hold the conference at a hotel?  Why not hold it in a less boycottable site, like a community center or a library?  The local police probably provide free security at such venues.  Those sites are covered by the First Amendment and are much less susceptible to the heckler&rsquo;s veto than hotels are.  If it must be at a hotel, why not a hotel that&rsquo;s on airport property that might be bound by some free speech conventions that wouldn&rsquo;t need to be observed by hotels on purely private land?</p>
<p>There are clubs on military bases that any member can reserve for meeting use.  In some instances, any honorably discharged service member can book these facilities.  The DOD has its own police that protects such facilities.  I was once involved in a group that used such a facility.  It was not in a secure area of the base but on a periphery easily accessed from freeways by the general public.  One time a kook made a threat against our strictly apolitical group (she perceived us as elitists), and the DOD Police staked out a position guarding the parking lot and had police inspect people coming into the clubhouse.  There was never any hint that we would have to cancel our activities.  One should start by identifying members who are also members of clubs like these.</p>
<p>Let delegates find their own rooms.  The protesters couldn&rsquo;t go after hundreds of delegates staying in 50 different hotels.</p>
<p>Finally, why keep holding the conference in the DC area, which is so overrun with the left?  Places away from the Northeast corridor lack the omnipresence of agitators.  It is much harder getting agitators to assemble in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati than in DC or New York.  Even holding it in Baltimore would reduce the salience of leftist agitators.</p>
<p>In short, there are lots of ways to get rid of these pests.</p>

		<p>If AmRen got off the &#8216;genetics first&rsquo; platform they at times appear to take, perhaps they&rsquo;d garner a bit more sympathy. It&rsquo;s one thing to be provocative just to get attention, it&rsquo;s another to embarrass whites who are upset about &#8216;civil and moral decline&rsquo; and all the racial preference denied whites.</p>

		<p>I agree with ajewamongyou that we should consider securing a hotel and then notifying the attendees right before the conference of the location so as to protect the hotel from threats - at least as long as we can. </p>
<p>I suggest renting a warehouse or some land and erecting a tent if necessary. A nice hotel would be ideal&hellip; but if we can&rsquo;t find one that won&rsquo;t buckle under in the face of these threats then I propose we consider other options and go ahead with the conference. We must not allow the terrorists to win. It may be necessary to reschedule the conference but I urge Mr. Taylor please do not give up. </p>
<p>This persecution only serves to strengthen my resolve to support American Renaissance. I have an idea&hellip; what if we all made a large donation to AR in honor of &#8220;The One People&rsquo;s Project&#8221; and all the other groups that worked to shut down the conference. Let&rsquo;s make AR more successful than ever and increase our donations to spite our enemies and to show them that their persecution will only backfire should they attempt it further. </p>
<p>I am going to make an extra large donation to AR in honor of Mr. Imms! Whenever someone feels the need to censor their opponents it should tell you that they feel insecure in their own ideas and arguments, they lack the ability to engage in a serious discussion on race because their positions cannot withstand the evidence and so instead they seek to suppress alternative views through threats of violence! </p>
<p>Liberals are contemptable people - they are in favor of free speech for every pornographer, deviant, pervert and freak but if you express a view they don&rsquo;t like they want to suppress you, in Europe people are fined and imprisoned in many cases for daring to express race realist sentiments.</p>
<p>I have noticed they keep referring to the AR conference as a &#8220;hate&#8221; or &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; event. Mr. Imms if you are reading this maybe they can explain to me how AR is a white supremacist organization when AR has published research indicating that North East Asians have higher average IQs than Whites on average and commit less crime than Whites on average? Somehow that doesn&rsquo;t sound very &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; to me. If AR truly &#8220;hates&#8221; non-whites, why was one of the speakers invited to the conference a Native American? These attacks are as false as they are comical. The AR conference is not nor has it ever been &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; it is instead race realist. </p>
<p>My fellow AR supporters, I urge you let&rsquo;s not let the terrorists win, please consider making a bigger donation to the New Century Foundation than you ever have before - and say you are making it in honor of Mr. Imms please. Let&rsquo;s send these people a message - in a non-violent and effective way, after all we are morally superior to our enemies we do not engage in their contemptable behavior. </p>

to powerfully reward the sharks who caused the Hotel cancellations. <br>
Why hold an AR Conference on American soil in these kinds of times and amidst the growing high tech, soft police state characteristics of American society?  My guess is that the Conference could have been held in Singapore or Kiev without hitch ?     </p>

		<p>Everybody seems to be having their little ideas, NOW.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t help thinking about a scene in THE WITCHES (part 4, if you&rsquo;re youtubing).  There&rsquo;s a convention, at a grand old English seaside hotel.  It&rsquo;s a group of ladies, The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  In actuality, it is a meeting of the Witches of England&hellip;witches who detest nothing more than children.  Angelica Huston plays The Grand High Witch.  The ladies assemble, lock the assembly room doors, and proceed to peel off their faces&hellip;masks, hiding their true Witch faces.  Too wonderful!</p>
<p>If only real life could work like the movies, and AR conventioners could arrive as The Society for the Glorification of Diversity&hellip;</p>

		<p>So, your plans this weekend are shot?  Well, since you already planned to devote this weekend to the cause, find a way to do that at home.  There are fliers on this website in the &#8220;Activist&rsquo;s Corner&#8221; that you can download and print.  Spend this weekend distributing them in your own community.  No excuses, folks.  If you had the time to go do DC for the conference this weekend, then you certainly have to do that.  The cancellation of this conference need not be in vain!   </p>

<p>Instead of cancelling this conference, they should record what was to be said for posterity and then hold another one in the summer. In short, postpone the February one with a twist; it would give these leftist loonies curdled kittens, that is to be certain. </p>
<p>In better weather, the conference could be held in a park or some similar venue, with guests allowed to make accommodations at a variety of local establishments. I know that this might seem beneath the standards normally set by AR; however, it is also a way to win this battle in an unorthodox manner.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Finally, why keep holding the conference in the DC area, which is so overrun with the left? Places away from the Northeast corridor lack the omnipresence of agitators. It is much harder getting agitators to assemble in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati than in DC or New York. Even holding it in Baltimore would reduce the salience of leftist agitators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.  In fact the one BIG reason I never attend an Amren conference is because it is always held in radical-leftist land.  I want nothing to do with those people.  I don&rsquo;t trust myself around them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read several suggestions regarding locations above, but I think the best idea is to just stay away from the East and Northeast.  Most of those in those areas are brainwashed fools.</p>

		<p>Good post, ehunter.</p>
<p>Two things: 1) Christianity and Marxism are twins, with similar tastes and desires. Jeffrey Imm and onepeoplesproject, if not the same, are very close, not only ideologically but probably personally. </p>
<p>Marxism is the big brother who knows the ways of the world, and how to get things done. Christianity is the wimpish little brother, who still has some rather endearing but naive notions about things. But they both want the same end result  &mdash;  one people, no one outstanding, no race outstanding. Everything must come out equal in the end.</p>
<p>2) I am not an advocate of violence, but it, or the threat of it, gets results. It was the threat of violence, unleashed with a wink by that man of love, Imm, that did this. And I have no doubt that the son of a ***** actually thinks it IS love, because a Marxist would define anything as love if it furthers the cause. Likewise, I am sure that the Catholic priests who tortured Jacques DeMolay for FIVE YEARS before burning him at the stake thought that they were the most loving and devout people on the planet.  </p>

<p>One way to salvage the conference and turn it into some kind of benefit would be to try to get as much media attention as possible. Some prominent news stories dealing with the bully tactics of the &#8220;champions of tolerance and diversity&#8221; would at least result in a surge of traffic to AmRen.com.</p>

		<p>Police in many areas can and do provide short-term security of  private locations during conferences, and both the Herndon Police and Fairfax County Police in Virginia have prevented protesters from entering and disrupting AR conferences before, which they can do specifically because the venues are private property and trespassing laws apply. </p>
<p>In contrast, we have seen what happened to Mr. Taylor at one public university when he was man-handled out of a speaking engagement by a student mob while the campus police did nothing. Public property venues will not allow any kind of orderly, dignified conference to happen.The problem with a public place is that the First Amendment protects not only AmRen&rsquo;s right to be there, but the protester&rsquo;s rights to stand there and disrupt it with shouting, banners, filming and photographing participants, etc.</p>
<p>I think AmRen&rsquo;s focus now should be to try to build some temporary alliances among  First Amendment/Free Speech organizations who have credibility with the both the left and the mainstream media, and who are willing to publicly advocate for right of the AmRen conference to go forward, even if they have strong philosophical disagreements with it&rsquo;s content. Once soem broader support is secured, it may be easier to find a suitable venue with an air-tight contract, even after full disclosure of the conference content. </p>
<p>To help gain support among a broader coalition, we should characterize this recent debacle as being first and foremost  an assault on the First Amendment and freedom of assembly, rather than &#8216;white rights&rsquo;. We can reasonably and logically apply the label of &#8216;terrorists&rsquo;  to those groups who have used intimidation tactics and  threats of violence to suppress the AR conference.  For now, try to avoid racialist arguments to present our case to a wider audience, and instead focus on the common threat to  civil liberties that these suppression efforts pose. Emphasize the illegitimate tactics used by the opposition, which in the case of threats and intimidation are certainly  not Constitutionally-protected speech,  and contrast it with the civil and lawful  exchange of ideas that the conferences are comprised of.  We need to emphasize these differences to counter  any equivalent claims of &#8216;free speech&rsquo; used by our opposition to try and defend their efforts to suppress the conference.  Let&rsquo;s make our voices heard on every web and media outlet out there, starting today.</p>

		<p>I am starting to have the uneasy feeling that we still don&rsquo;t have full information about this situation.</p>
<p>If I have read previous postings correctly, the management of the various hotels were subjected to harassment, intimidation, trespass and even threats of murder.  And yet <i>no</i> one called the DC police?  Or if they did, were the police unwilling to respond in any way?</p>
<p>This is more than just an outrage to all White nationalists, it&rsquo;s flat-out criminal behavior of the most flagrant kind.  If these incidents were not reported to the police, why not?  And if they were, did the police refuse to act?</p>
<p>If the DC police would not react to reports of serious crimes, this is a national scandal and should be pursued as such.  And if the crimes were not reported, it&rsquo;s still a scandal.</p>

		<p>So far, it seems not a single news source or blog unconnected with this movement has picked up this story, even though Amren put out a press release upon the earlier cancellation several days ago.  The one reporter genuninely interested in AmRen, Mr. Tilove, is currently out of a job as I understand.  This ought to be a national and a LOCAL story, particularly if there were criminal threats made against the hotels.  Jared, I hoping you&rsquo;re trying your best to get some mainstream press on this issue and also to reach out to civil liberties groups ostensibly committed to the right to freely assemble.  One angle: suggest to a tv producer that you would gladly do an on-air segment WITH Mr. Imm, discussing what happened.  If not Mr. Imm, I&rsquo;m sure some other leftist would be happy to get on tv with you to take credit for what happened. also play up the griffin angle, that he was to speak, as the mainstream media is interested in him.   </p>

		<p>The lesson has been well learned by Muslims and the left: if you threaten violence then cancellations occur. I&rsquo;m sure this intimidation is well organized, especially by the militant Muslims. New laws need to be made but not enough politicians have the spine to involve themselves.</p>
<p>However, in a way the harm is not too much in these days of internet communications in the sense that those who would have attended to hear the AR speakers know they can easily read or hear what they have to say on the web. The cancellations at universities of politically incorrect speakers is a worse problem since a lot of students never get the messages they would have gotten.</p>

		<p>It will be very hard to find venues.  The problem is no the lost hotels, but how they were lost.  We all know there is a double standard with law enforcement.  The only thing that fixes anything this serious in American anymore is loss of money.  People, businesses, and governments have a bottom dollar.  Law enforcement must be sued, and repeatedly sued when they do anything less than they&rsquo;d do for the NAACP.  The threats to America are not inside of that conference  &mdash;  the threats to America are the kind of people who allowed the threats, intimidation, and acts of terrorism to go without investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>David Duke almost didn&rsquo;t get to have his conference  &mdash;  **because of the same people**. He has since found other ways to speak and meet people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to explore the US government&rsquo;s definition of terrorism and aptly name OPP, their associates and supporters with it.  They clearly fit the definition.  Law enforcement has got to be forced to do their jobs  &mdash;  we are all taxpayers, too.  If they think we are doing something wrong or harmful, then they need to PROVE it.  Harm is being done in reverse.</p>
<p>The only thing that will even begin to address this is to take money away from those who have allowed it, and freedom away from the thugs who did it.</p>

		<p>I, for one, think we should try to make the best of this.  </p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m very disappointed that I won&rsquo;t be shaking hands with you folks, and sitting down in the political center of the country to hear the exciting lineup of speakers. And I&rsquo;m not one to ramble on about &#8220;moral victories&#8221; when faced with a practical defeat.</p>
<p>But, they DID resort to terrorism.</p>
<p>We can make the best of a bad situation.  We can gain a great deal by trying to draw the debate out into broad daylight.  They didn&rsquo;t protest our views; they protested our right to express them, and people don&rsquo;t like that.  And they resorted to despicable tactics in so doing.</p>
<p>Remember what happened with Nick Griffin?  After the televised debates his popularity soared, and many people indicated that the behaviour of protesters was a factor.</p>

<p>I disagree.  </p>
<p>A big part of any movement has to be public perception.  We shouldn&rsquo;t be sneaking around, conducting ourselves like an obscure group of outcasts, or hiding behind a wall of armed guards.  This is alienating.  We should be acting like legitimate members of society, because we are.  </p>

I agree that the AR Conference should be moved to the either the Deep South or an obscure part of the rural Midwest. Our enemies are not as strong in those regions, and some are unwilling to travel to what they consider &ldquo;flyover land&rdquo; or &ldquo;redneck territory&rdquo;  I hope we don&rsquo;t have to have future conferences on an ocean liner 20 miles off the coast of the United States, but who knows?</p>

Good post, ehunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two things: 1) Christianity and Marxism are twins, with similar tastes and desires. Jeffrey Imm and onepeoplesproject, if not the same, are very close, not only ideologically but probably personally. </p>
<p>Marxism is the big brother who knows the ways of the world, and how to get things done. Christianity is the wimpish little brother, who still has some rather endearing but naive notions about things. But they both want the same end result &mdash; one people, no one outstanding, no race outstanding. Everything must come out equal in the end.</p>
<p>2) I am not an advocate of violence, but it, or the threat of it, gets results. It was the threat of violence, unleashed with a wink by that man of love, Imm, that did this. And I have no doubt that the son of a ***** actually thinks it IS love, because a Marxist would define anything as love if it furthers the cause. Likewise, I am sure that the Catholic priests who tortured Jacques DeMolay for FIVE YEARS before burning him at the stake thought that they were the most loving and devout people on the planet. &#8220;</p>
<p>Finally, someone I can relate to.  Not only was DeMolay tortured repeatedly, when he recanted his confession under torture, he and his Marshall, Goeffry de Charney were not burned, but roasted, slowly be these loving representatives of Christ.  But more to the point, this persecution drove the Templars underground, where they likely joined stonemason guilds (many of which were Templar run already) to emerge approximately two hundred years later in Scotland as the Freemasons. No one heading or belonging to Amren has been physically tortured, let alone roasted to death yet, but it is plain that any conferrence in the future will have to be arranged on private property.  I think this is a good idea anyway.  Going by the under 100 posts on this issue, it is obvious that the check list of those who agree with 100% of what Amren seems to stand for, including repetitive poster comments over the five years or so I have been reading and commenting via the Amren website, sympathy for the cause is tiny.  Yet it is an important voice that ought to have its freedom to speak in public.  Personally, I would not attend a conferrence because I am almost as afraid of some of the likely attendees as I would be of the prone to violence hecklers at the entrance to any publicly accessable venue.  But even the private Bohemian Club in Sonoma County, California, a long time hideout for top political and corporate cronies, it pretty much died out after decades, due to the annual protests at the gate.  Those people now meet at well publicized venues as the G-8, or 10, or 12, or whoever.  And the protests are nearly always violent.</p>
<p>But for me, until Amren and the majority of posters show me better deliberated and INTELLIGENT notions where strategy and outlook is concerned, I feel I must remain a sympathetic critic of your movement.<br>

		<p>Would it be possible to file some sort of lawsuit against these hotels for discriminating against our organization?</p>
<p>I guarantee that if some black organization was treated in this way (having four hotels turn them away) they would find a way to sue and probably would get lots of damages awarded.</p>
<p>It is truly unbelivable that our organization is not being allowed to meet because the host hotels are being bullied and threatened.  Is this what the future of America will be like?</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s new bill of rights:</p>
<p>1. You have the right of free speech as long as you agree with the government.  If you disagree, then your speech will be called hate speech.</p>
<p>2.  Everyone will be treated equally in this country, except for white people (who will discriminated against with affirmative action).</p>
<p>3.  White people must stand idly by while they are being displaced by minorities, and must accept being treated like second class citizens (via affirmative action) as the government brings more and more third world immigrants into the country.</p>

		<p>Folks, let&rsquo;s not leave the immediate response to this suppressive campaign up to Mr. Taylor and his staff, as they likely have their hands full with the administrative tedium of processing refunds and other tasks related to the sudden cancelation of the conference. </p>
<p>Get your keyboards and telephones working today, gentlemen! Contact every purported free speech organization in the US by email or phone and let them know what you think about the actions of AR&rsquo;s opponents.  Start message board threads on every alternative news website you can find so we can get this issue on the radar of the media. </p>
<p>Here is one potential starting point, based their website content:</p>
<p><b>National Coalition Against Censorship</b><br>
275 Seventh Avenue, Suite 1504, New York, NY 10001 <br>
tel: (212) 807-6222 <br>
fax: (212) 807-6245<br>
email: ncac@ncac.org<br>
web: <a href="https://www.ncac.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncac.org</a></p>
<p>From their Issues&gt;Hate Speech section: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Should government control, even ban, speech that &ldquo;incites religious and ethnic hatred&rdquo;? Many governments in Europe have answered in the affirmative: they have not only criminalized hate speech, they are actively prosecuting - and occasionally convicting  &mdash;  artists, curators, and writers accused of stirring anti-Muslim or anti-Christian hatred.</i></p>
<p>In the U.S. things are different. The drafters of the U.S. constitution, haunted by fresh memories of religious intolerance in the Old World, were uncomfortable with the idea of governmental control of expression, whether political or religious. Thus, the First Amendment protects, among other types of expression, speech that might offend particular social groups.</p>
<p>It follows that if the government should not be able to suppress speech deemed offensive to others, neither should private organizations, and certainly not with the tactics used by AR&rsquo;s opponents. So let us all contact this organization and see if they are willing to back up the statements on their website with a press release or statement of support  for the AR conference, affirming our right to gather in a private venue without harassment or intimidation.</p>

<p>I am in complete agreement with Anon 20. There really has to be a shift away from the Rushton genetics stuff to a laser beam focus on the race-repalcment consequences of post-1965 immigration policy and the ecological and economic devastation that comes with race-replacement. I believe that if you did this, many more White Americans would revolt against thier race-replacement. You don&rsquo;t have to discuss anything else. If you do raise the race and IQ issue, you sidetrack the discussion away from the race-replacement post-1965 immigration policy</p>

<p>White people&rsquo;s rights are just not news.<br>
This is why Amren is so important and so necessary.</p>
<p>On the tactics used to frighten these hotels into cancelling, you know that if we ever stooped as low as to threaten any sort of physical violence or intimidation it would be international news.<br>
And of course law enforcement (at least) at the local level is obligated to be investigating the instigator(s) of those threats.</p>
<p>If Amren was any other group, the frustration caused from being suppressed like this would be the rationalisation for such behaviour. <br>
I guess as always, more is expected from us.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose heart organizers or supporters.<br>
We can never give up!<br>
I agree with the others on this forum who have said that the fact that this conference is being so adamantly targeted is a sign that Amren is taken as a very credible threat.<br>
This is why debate is censored and inconvenient truths avoided.<br>
As we are right.</p>

		<p>It is a very sad day that mob rule has silenced free speech in the USA<br>
In Australia the &#8220;loony left&#8221; agenda first surfaced in the 70&rsquo;s, the unions were all for it and both sides of politics embraced it. This agenda included lots of &#8220;rights&#8221; anti-discrimination laws as well as AA and a non discriminatory immigration policy.<br>
VERY FEW people spoke out against any of this, those that did were called bigots, nazis or racist. One or 2 brave members of parliament spoke out and promptly lost their endorsement for the party they represented. The larger population was NEVER consulted about any of these things. We were told that we had obligations under UN treaties for all of this social engineering, human rights, refugee acceptance etc.(Strange Only USA,UK,EU, Canada, Oz &amp; NZ seem to be obliged to accept these UN rulings!)<br>
We imported plane loads of both legal and illegal 3rd world immigrants to the point where Australian State police services now have special Asian &amp; Middle East crime task forces. We have a significant population of unemployable African welfare recipients and so the list could go on.<br>
Most people in Australia hate what is happening yet very few say anything. Sound familiar? very sad.</p>

<p>There are other explanatory options for black failure other than low black IQ-I am not claiming that this isn&rsquo;t true-or White racism. Why do we have the burden of trying to explain black failure. Look, the real issue is affirmative action. And a strong case can be made against it without resorting to the IQ argument-even if it is scientifically valid. The burden should be put on blacks to come up with an alternative to affirmative action which is discrimination against White Americans. Of course shutting all LEGAL IMMIGRATION down to 0 is one alternative. If blacks do not accept this&hellip;well I do not care. Now blacks may resort to violence against Whites if they do not get affirmative action. At this point in time, there would have to be serious discussion about separating from blacks within the US&hellip;and self-defense against black violence towards White Americans.</p>

<p>I agree with the other posters, that the conference must go on.  It does not have to be a hotel, it can be a hall rented, as long as there is security.  Army sites sound good.  Locations in the South and away from the biggest cities would work.  Lots of cameras and security would be a plus.</p>
<p>Remember, the libbarbarians will have to drive there too, to protest. And most of them are lazy.  They may organize and show up in Washington DC, but are unlikely to drive all the way to small town, USA.  The libarbarians often do not have cars.</p>
<p>Having the conference, somewhere, anywhere, is important because it would a psychological punch in the face of the libbarbarians.  When they feel they were able to block the conference, they feel successful and motivated to continue their criminal tactics.  When they feel they failed, most of these thugs are likely to feel discouraged and give up. </p>
<p>So please have the conference  &mdash;  somewhere, anywhere, safe.</p>

<p>When did every racial group have to be exactly equal with every other as far as incomes, location or even investments or wealth (or at least as far as non-whites are concerned)? Isn&rsquo;t this accepting the paradigm of the multiculturalists? There&rsquo;s no need to have a grand universal theory of all things racial. The diversity crowd prefers not to spell it out in writing. If you look at the diversity crowd, if you add up what they say individually - complete all the pieces of the puzzle, they are basically saying that everywhere on the globe, white men are responsible for all evil in the past and evils continuation into the present. </p>
<p>We can each state our own experiences and our own personal viewpoints and add them to the discussion. Earlier this week someone pointed out that whites aren&rsquo;t&rsquo; getting their fair share of heart transplants. &#8216;Average IQ differences&rsquo; are completely irrelevant to what most whites in utopia experience. There&rsquo;s no need to harp on &#8216;IQ&rsquo; to the exclusion of all else. &#8216;White supremacists&rsquo; might even be surprised to find IQ differences don&rsquo;t always travel in the direction they would imagine. I do enjoy reading about this when it does come up in the MSN - it&rsquo;s often prudent not to comment or generalize to much, or to complete the picture. </p>

<p>I have been saying these things for years, but most white Americans are not race realists nor opponents of the Multicultural Integrationist Leviathan. Frankly, too many white Americans are either clueless about it all, or just in denial about what is happening in this country. They continue to jabber on about what a free country we live in. And just what freedoms do they DARE to take advantage of? Watching TV. Shopping. A &#8220;land of the free&#8221; can not be sustained as a free land by ignorant, comfort-loving cowards. If most white Americans had the insight and intelligence as well as courage to be on the same page as AR readers, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem. Public cowardice and ignorance enable evil to prevail.<br>

<p>The confused public would say that it was private interests, not government, that shut the conference down. The leftoid thugs who issued death threats to the hotel management will probably get away with it because they are doing the dirty work the government would like to do but can&rsquo;t.

We can all safely assume Eric Holder in the Justice Department won&rsquo;t pursue any of this. </p>
<p>Politicians in the USA boast about the high standard of human rights enjoyed by their citizens. Intellectual freedom and freedom of expression and opinion are essential human rights. If the police and prosecutors don&rsquo;t pursue thugs who threaten other peoples freedoms and rights, then those freedoms and rights are not secure in this country, and the people who have been silenced and &#8220;shut down&#8221; without adequate protection from the authorities have truly experienced a human rights violation.  </p>
<p>Just who are these thugs? The One People&rsquo;s Project, supposedly run by Daryle Lamont Jenkins, is actually a pet project of the Brecht Forum, located at 451 West Street (that&rsquo;s the West Side Highway) in New York City.  </p>

		<p>I think Amren should purchase a good sized parcel of land somewhere in the mid-west [ so as to be closer to more people than on one of the coasts ] and build OUR OWN compound/ conference center where the conference could be held in peace every year. We could schedule several conferences a year far in advance knowing that it wouldn&rsquo;t be canceled at the last minute.  It would be surrounded by a security fence, have its own security and have a guarded gate with only members and invited guests allowed to enter. We beg and pay these liberal run hotels every year to use their property when we should be spending OUR money with OUR OWN. If it got big enough, we could even have a hotel on the property. Please Mr. Taylor, consider this idea. We aren&rsquo;t going to get &#8220;to the mountain top&#8221; by begging and paying liberals to use their properties. The Muslims have several gated, guarded and private compounds in this country, why can&rsquo;t we!  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see why if AR had a valid contract, that it did not refuse to cancel. The problem was not with the AR guests, it was with the protestors, and both police and the hotel are responsible for providiing security.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was some out clause of the hotel that allowed it to cancel, but if not, then shouldn&rsquo;t AR just continued on and had 100 or so guests arrive demanding they be booked in their rooms as scheduled?</p>
<p>A little explanation by AR is due on the this matter.</p>

Excuse me??? Blacks already rape, pillage, and murder Whites every day in this nation.  They have now for half a century. Our concern, however, as pertains to the cancellation of the AR conference, is venom-spewing left wing monsters.</p>
<p>As far as the location for a new conference goes&hellip;I live in the D.C. metro area so I would naturally like to see our conference take place here.  However, I would be willing to do all I can if we are forced out to Oklahoma, Alabama, or Anywhere, USA.</p>

		<p>I am currently having a dialogue with Mr. Imm on facebook. He so far has denied making any threats, but merely asking for the Hotel to honor his views and provide a conference or podium in which for him to espouse his organization&rsquo;s views as well as Amren.</p>
<p>He also completely denies any wrongdoings, stating that it was only the Hotel who canceled after being told that &#8220;Jared Taylor&rsquo;s organization sought to stifle and deny the human dignity&#8221; of the diversity of the hotel&rsquo;s guests.</p>
<p>This man of course was just caught on Derek Black&rsquo;s radio show, being exposed by the producer of spamming the station and fellow hosts with threats of boycotts, protests, and asking for Mr. Black to be removed and only admitted as much when exposed live on the air.</p>
<p>I asked him what justifiable right does he posess to intervene in the private affairs of people who gather in a private setting, to dicuss legal activities and subjects, using personal funds? What justifiable right?</p>
<p>So far? No answer in return.</p>

		<p>we have to stop fooling are selves that we live in a free country,we do not.Things are way beyond the stage where we attend a conference with like minded people and discuss the problems of our country. The powers that be have their foot on are necks and are more then willing to crush us. If we are to survive we must be willing to see that we must use every means nessesary to wake up the those that are asleep.Most Americans have no idea that they are headed for a future that will be unpleasent at best and horrible at worst.

		<p>I must disagree with #20 and #87.  For very legitimate reasons, AR must discuss what is known about IQ, heritability of IQ, and racial differences in IQ.  Not only does the left know what we know about high black crime, high black rates of illegitimate births, poor black academic performance, and low black incomes, they make sure these facts are well known, so that everybody is aware of how oppressed and downtrodden black people are.  The left takes as a bedrock assumption that there can&rsquo;t be any intrinsic differences among the races.  It follows that the innumerable instances of black failure MUST be due to wicked white racists, and if you can&rsquo;t find any Klansmen actually keeping black kids from doing their homework in the &#8216;hood, it must be due to the ever mysterious institutional racism.  That is what gives the left the moral justification to favor discriminatory laws and policies against whites.</p>
<p>In short, to defeat the arguments of the left we have to point out that their bedrock assumption is wrong.  If we lived in a more libertarian society, where businesses could hire whom they want, schools could admit the students they want, landlords could rent to whom they want, and the federal government stuck to controlling the borders and delivering the mail, we could all politely ignore the evidence of genetically based differences among the races.  But the statists are in charge. We have no choice but to rub their noses in the unpleasant truth, if we want to defend ourselves against unending blame and discrimination.  <br>

		<p>That Mr. Taylor and those assisting him have made a remarkable<br>
contribution of lasting historical signifidance  does not make it any desecration to consider what mistakes may have been made. To focus merely upon what is being done  t o   AR is less useful than to look at what possibly AR has done to itself unwittingly that is now clearly seen as mistaken.  I respectfully suggest that the emphasis upon biannual Conferences has misallocated resources that could have been more usefully deployed by simply having a Net presence and an interactive potential linking off- campus groups in several of our major university settings.   It has always been a matter of an American (and thus attenuated) version of SAMIZDAT.  And the samizdat forces will fight from off campus in university  setting after university setting to expose, excoriate, the miseducation and to shame into rectitude the academic prostitutes and careerists who proliferate within the miseducation   Leadership arises this way  &mdash;  not from nurturing initially and basically a national leadership core from out of the personal acquaintances and discourses attendant to these biannual  national  Conferences.  The Conferences since 1996 have been a misallocation and an important mistake.   </p>

		<p>I completely agree with Anon post 20. Amren would expand its readership and support membership 100x if it STOPPED EMPHASIZING GENETICS.<br>
&#8220;Genetic discussion lead instantly to visions of Nazi eugenics. <br>
Sorry..but thats the hard wired mental response and it kills Amren<br>
every time.<br>
Time to move on..move on. The real issue here is the Defense of Western Civlization, the Demographic revolution going on in the the USA and its consequences to whites. Emphasis must be on how the Leftist causes of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace&rdquo; are stalking horses<br>
for Marxism, much of it directed from abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. White genes built this civilization and those whites most certainly did believe in race and they fought to the death whenever they were faced with invaders.  Fast forward today and the only people who don&rsquo;t believe in race are whites just because the marxists said so.  As long as whites don&rsquo;t believe in who they are they will be invaded by nonwhites.  <br>

<p>The more I think about, the more I like the of holding the conference in Hagerstown Matyland. Hagerstown is a Southern town. Almost all the workers in the Hotels-very nice big hotels-are Southern White Women with Southern accents. For this reason I gave very big tips in the Hotel restaurants. Hagerstown is between rural Pnnsylvana and rural West Virgina.</p>
<p>Also think about deep in the Shennandoah Valley near a very famous Civil War Battlefield. The Pakistanis are in the early stages of colonizing this rural Southern White area.</p>
<p>How about Charlotte NC area&hellip;</p>
<p>To the other folks concerned about the genetic stuff. I am a hard -core White Nationaist. I oppose race-replacement through post-1965 immigration policy for a fundamental gentic reason:the racial genepool that I belong to will be replaced by the genepool of foriegners from India,Pakistan,Korea, Africa and otjer places.</p>
<p>How ever, The IQ and race discussion-debates on TV will always sidetrack away from the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMEICANS isssue. I can tell from personal expereince that there are is a growing popualtion of NATIE BORN WHITE AMERICAN engineer who despise the Indians they are forced to work with. I encouter and interact  these White Guys all the time. The last thing they want to here is a White Nationalist on TV making the case that science has shown that Asians are smarter than Whites. I can not overemphasize how tactically foolish it is to do this. I know NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN MALE engineers who have gone ballistic upon seeing and hearing this. Whst shopuld be talked about on TV is the H-1 and L-1 visa programs and the the race-replacement ov WHITE engineers by nonwhite foriegners from India and China.</p>

Even in NY you could have found someone &#8220;connected&#8221; to make arrangements in a discrete way.

		<p>To those who suggest that Amren should upload online speeches on youtube instead of holding conferences: Doing so is certainly better than having nothing, but online activities will never substitute a real conference. The main purpose of attending a conference is not only to listen to the speakers, but also to meet and chat with people who share common concerns about the plight of whites and western civilization. Such a social platform is what our movement lacks, but which the left, muslims and blacks have in abundance. It would be great to have a place where we could gather more frequently than once in two years, but I acknowledge that the admission must apply some sort of membership filter so as to keep leftist infiltrators out.</p>

(1) It&rsquo;s news to me that infiltrators have been kept out of the<br>
AR Conferences<br>
(2) The meetings that have roots and growth potential are local and regional, and form the genuine basis for viable national meetings, as warranted.  <br>
(3) What is needed nationally is not a conventional Hotel to<br>
check into but rather a Net nodal point for expert information and advice to local situations across the Land.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta say,</p>
<p>Simply the fact that the conference was to be held in the DC area was enough to keep us from even considering it as a possibility.  That whole zone&hellip; Boston to Richmond&hellip;is synonymous to many of us with congestion, inconvenience, and danger.  And the term &#8216;Washington, DC&rsquo; summons images of evil people and ugly buildings.  Many of us have absolutely NO positive associations regarding the nation&rsquo;s capitol: NONE.</p>
<p>Branson, Missouri is a little downmarket for us, but it would be a fun drive over there.  No worries about parking, or getting diverted into a DC slum, or any of that.  And the terrorists would be more than a little out of place there&hellip;.should they show up&hellip;which I doubt.  </p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d be up for flying into Omaha, or Missoula, or driving to Gatlinburg.  A convention&rsquo;s being held near the Capitol no longer enhances legitimacy&hellip;not for me&hellip;and probably not for most Amren supporters.</p>
