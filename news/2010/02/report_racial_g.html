			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Gersema, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The racial gap is widening with the increase in charter schools in Arizona and other states due to a lack of regulation and enforcement of existing civil-rights regulations, a group of researchers based at the University of California-Los Angeles said in a new report.</p>
<p>The UCLA Civil Rights Project report, &#8220;Choice Without Equity,&#8221; revealed what researchers deemed a troubling pattern of racial stratification in charter schools across the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Based on data collected from 2000 to 2007 by the National Center for Education Statistics, the researchers found patterns that indicate charter schools in Arizona, California and other Western states have become havens for &#8220;White flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the 98,728 students enrolled in Arizona charter schools in 2007, 52 percent were White, 34 percent Latino, 7 percent Black, 4 percent American Indian and 3 percent Asian.</p>
<p>Orfield said this racial gap has been widening over three decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;The (Southwest) region has experienced very sharp increases in segregation of Latino students since the 1970s, and it is usually segregation by both race and poverty, and sometimes language as well,&#8221; Orfield wrote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers also had said in their report that although a majority of the students in Arizona charter schools are White, a few charter schools have a majority of ethnic minority students  &mdash;  which researchers refer to as &#8220;isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers said the pattern of segregation in charter schools has emerged as public support for &#8220;school choice&#8221; is on the rise. The goal of this educational movement is to give families opportunities to choose which school their children will attend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This has left researchers pondering how race plays into school choice. They admitted they cannot explain whether parents enroll their children in the schools with conscious consideration of demographics.<br>

		<p>Socalled &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws and court decisions have destroyed US eduation. Perhaps charter schools are a way around centralized socialist black first control of our schools, but I doubt it. Eric Holder and his thought police will crush any effort to install excellence(e.g., white control) over our public school systems. Only place you find real excellence in US education is in private elementary and secondary education, free from federal control. You know, the schools Mulatto Obama sends his &#8220;black&#8221; children. </p>

		<p>As a grandparent of 4 gifted white boys, who range from 2 to 6 years ahead of their grade levels, I can tell you that the choice to homeschool the kids was not based on race, but on the rate of learning.  Our kids could not deal with being held back because the others around them were much slower learners.  Of course, there were some behavioral issues with the black and Hispanic students; their behavior was despicable, and we felt that there would be much more harm in exposing our kids to that kind of deportment than there could ever be good in showing them the joys of diversity.  As a result, our kids have a combination of home schooling and charter schooling, and it works for them and for us.  Yes our kids are segregated, but by default rather than by intent.  Blacks and Hispanics simply could not keep up with our boys, and we refuse to allow our kids to be held back because of the lack of ability in other students.</p>

		<p>I think that charter schools, particularly the online variety, are the new trend for Whites as well as other racial groups that feel poorly served by their school districts. </p>
<p>The complaints made by this &#8220;research group&#8221; are irrelevant. If they were indeed a research group following the scientific method then there should be a link to their work. They also seem to be weighing in on a volatile social issue - actions which regardless of the results of any scientific inquiry, are never warranted. Their findings are the same tripe that we are used to hearing and an affront scientific understanding and an insult to common sense.</p>
<p>Here is their mission statement. It should be noted that only when you insure fair procedure, do you insure fair treatment. They seem to believe as many Liberals do, that equitable outcome = equal procedure. I will allow others to comment on the utter lack of scientific objectivism .</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission of the Civil Rights Project / Proyecto Derechos Civiles is to help renew the civil rights movement by bridging the worlds of ideas and action, to be a preeminent source of intellectual capital within that movement, and to deepen the understanding of the issues that must be resolved to achieve racial and ethnic equity as society moves through the great transformation of the 21st century.  We believe that either the country will learn to deal effectively with the richness of its astonishing diversity or it will lose pace in a globalizing world and decline and divide. Focused research and the best ideas of scholars and leaders from all parts of the country can make a decisive contribution to a renewal of the promise of the civil rights movement.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so old when I attended school all students either made it and passed or they stayed behind.  All students, black, white, indian.  We were all equally smart with equal opportunity.</p>
<p>The last thing our government wants is equal opportunity; they want to hold back certain races of people and make them drag along the less capable.  </p>
<p>Our government has accomplished the dumbing down of our entire country in the last fifty years, can it get dumber? oh yes.</p>
<p>Keep the faith, home school, private school, do whatever it takes to allow you children to advance as rapidly as possible.</p>

		<p>Preparation Hbomb: You are experiencing the dilemma of many white and Asian Americans  &mdash;  a public school system that focuses on the least intelligent and most poorly behaved students. We see this at the classroom level (the teacher devotes disproportionate attention to the slow learners and the unruly), and we see this at the system level (the costly but futile efforts to keep drugs, gangs, and guns out of schools). In my opinion, the best solution to this dilemma would be educational vouchers: give me a $6,000 voucher and I can find a private school where my child won&rsquo;t be held back by the standards of Africa-America.</p>

		<p>Equity would not guarantee results.. it would simply provide an environment where citizens are lawfully prevented from infringing on other citizens. Nations today will likely be more floating than geographic. Whites have more in common with each other regardless of their nation than with a different race living next door. When a nation morphs from an organic racial identity to a purely legislative one that actually represents an eclectic hodgepodge..the meaning of nation is also changed. Human beings have a spiritual side, no doubt and there are avenues for this side of our nature, but we also have an instinctual side. Our instinctual side causes us to prefer our own bed or eat food we are accustomed to or associate with our own kind. The global effort of intelligentsia to encourage whites to miscegenate themselves out of their identity is obvious to anyone with the least awareness. This is whats really at bottom of civil rights* The more important thing is for people to stop worrying about who&rsquo;s doing better, but rather for each person to do their best and appreciate what they do have. Individuals and races have different talents&hellip; there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this* Social engineers who refuse to see the obvious are the real problem.</p>
