<h1>Miguel Perez: Time to Say, &#8220;No Se Puede&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Abilene Reporter News (Texas), February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign promise [about immigration reform] he [Barack Obama] made for last year cannot be accomplished this year, either. Comprehensive immigration reform will have to wait. The president needs to be as honest with Latinos as he has been with the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>After all, Latinos played a huge part in getting Obama elected, and if they begin to see him as just another devious Democrat, they are not likely to vote for him again.</p>
<p>When he finally spoke about immigration in his State of the Union address (as the very last topic he listed on his agenda), the 36 words he chose were so vague  &mdash;  so carefully selected to say absolutely nada that could be considered controversial  &mdash;  that the president lost a lot of respect from his pro-immigrant supporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There was no mention of a legalization plan for undocumented immigrants, no timetable for getting legislation through Congress, no stated commitment to stop the many anti-immigrant policies he inherited from the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Fighting words these were not. They were an insult to the intelligence of those who remember his speeches during his campaign for president. Whatever happened to the Obama who vowed that he would &#8220;never walk away from the 12 million undocumented immigrants who live, work and contribute to our country every single day&#8221; in remarks to the National Council of La Raza in 2007?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amazingly, some immigrant rights advocates still are praising Obama&rsquo;s commitment to immigration reform and relying on him to deliver the many changes he promised. After many of them persuaded Latino voters to support Obama because he was going to fix immigration, now they find it hard to acknowledge that they were wrong.</p>
<p>They need to stop building false hopes and expectations among undocumented immigrants and start confronting the president who has betrayed them.</p>
<p>And if Obama wants to be re-elected in 2012, he needs to be forthright with Latinos, and he needs to speak to them pronto. Perhaps another La Raza speech is necessary.</p>
<p>If Obama acknowledges that his drive to reform health care has slowed progress on everything else, if he accepts responsibility for his inability to lower the unemployment rate, if he explains that he has been busy with other crucial priorities, perhaps he can convince many Latino immigrants that he is still their friend. If he explains that the Democratic Party no longer has a supermajority in the Senate, that many of his fellow Democrats are scared of tackling immigration and that he lacks the votes needed to win an immigration fight this year, perhaps he still can persuade many Latinos and other immigrants to cut him some slack  &mdash;  at least until 2011.</p>
<p>But if he goes on with the recent charade, building false hopes and expectations while continuing to follow Bush&rsquo;s immigration policies, Latinos will be saying &#8220;No Se Puede&#8221; to Obama when he runs for re-election in 2012.</p>

		<p>Pity, I was sort of looking forward to a huge fight over amnesty this year. Win or lose, it seemed like an excellent opportunity to persuade more white people to become racially conscious.</p>
<p>The economy will have to improve a lot over the next couple of years for amnesty to become an acceptable pill for mainstream whites to swallow. And I think there&rsquo;s going to be weak growth and nagging high levels of unemployment for years, if not permanently.</p>
<p>On the downside, every year the illegals live here they get slightly more &#8220;legitimate.&#8221; To weak stomached whites it would seem cruel to deport them.</p>

		<p>The dirty little secret is that there doesn&rsquo;t need to be a formal amnesty passed for there to be amnesty.  Not enforcing immigration law to the extent that it should be enforced is the functional equivalent of amnesty.  Combine that with birthright citizenship, sanctuary cities and jurisdictions, and other things, and the illegals are practically home free.</p>

		<p><i>And if Obama wants to be re-elected in 2012, he needs to be forthright with Latinos, and he needs to speak to them pronto. </i></p>
<p>Really? I would have thought if he actually came right out and <i>said</i> that latinos were pretty much just another group of fools who he and his party figure they can keep dependent and subservient by making sure they remain poor and needy; and keep loyal by appealing to their envy/hatred of white people, they&rsquo;d give up on him completely.</p>
<p>Then again, that assumes a modicum of good sense on their part. Honestly, I figure if he went in front of La Raza and said something like,</p>
<p>&#8220;Your people will be forever penniless, illiterate serfs; with nothing to look forward to but destitution and back-breaking labor forever as long as you are in this country; but dammit we&rsquo;re gonna get those evil racist gringos for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be doing the village idiot &#8220;si se puede&#8221; cheer all over again.</p>

<p>And for whom <i>are</i> they likely to vote?  Somehow I can&rsquo;t see any huge Mexican groundswell for the Republican party, no matter how fervently the likes of John McCain might wish it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask the more fundamental question: why are these people permitted a voice in American politics <i>at all</i>?</p>
<p>&#8220;A legalization plan for undocumented immigrants [sic]?&#8221;  Also spelled &#8220;T-R-E-A-S-O-N.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The latinos or should I say mestizos, have to understand that there a growing rift in the Democrat Party between warring factions of blacks and mestizos.  Blacks are aware that mestizos are a threat to the economic and political gains they&rsquo;ve made over the past few decades and mestizos are salivating at the prospect of replacing blacks as the White liberal&rsquo;s favorite pet minority.  Black displacement is being actively encouraged by factions within the Democrat Party and Republican Party elements as well.  An amnesty will officially make hispanics the largest minority group in the nation and that will definitely cut into the black share of the welfare/affirmative action/freebies pie.  There are so many black political figures living in districts that are largely hispanic with the only thing keeping them in power is that many of their constituents are not US citizens and cannot vote them out of office.  All that will change though.  I would be surprised if there were even 5 black Congressmen in the House of Representatives in 20 years.  They would have to rename the Black Caucus the Black Cluster.  </p>

		<p>Why is it that this is the only group that demands two standards in this country? Why is it that the Latino voters want amnesty? To me it demonstrates that they are Latino first and Americans last. The audacity of these people is second only to the illegal invaders themselves. </p>

		<p>&#8220;That doesn&rsquo;t mean that Latinos are likely to vote for a Republican, especially if an immigrant-basher wins the GOP nomination. It means that if Latinos still feel betrayed by the president, if they see Obama as another devious Democrat, they will stay home on Election Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, they vote strictly on the basis of race, not on what is best for the country.  It&rsquo;s more than obvious that they want to, in effect, move Mexico up into the US, with all the attendent loyalties to that country and its traditions and culture.  They cannot build a successful society, so the next best thing for them is to inundate an adjoining country that is prospering and eventually take it over.</p>
<p>These people are really seditionists, far beyond racists.  Like blacks they eat, sleep, live and breathe, thinking only of advancing themselves as a racial group and not as citizens of this country.</p>
<p>What did their signs say?  &#8220;Europeans are illegal.  Go back to Europe.  This land is are(sic)land.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in the face of all their biased actions and words and all their anti-white hate-mongering, not one word from a politician condemning them for it.  Not one.</p>

		<p>I predict that no immigration bill will be passed this year because of the midterm elections. Congress knows that their constiutents do not want amnesty for illegal alients. They do not want the Dream Act or any other bill that would give any kind of legal status to illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I don&rsquo;t hold the illegal aliens responsible for our government&rsquo;s refusal to protect our borders and enforce our immigration laws. They do this because we Americans allow then to get away with it by our refusal to punish Congress by voting out every incumbent who doesn&rsquo;t write the most draconian enforcement laws imaginable.  If we put in anti-immigration politicians with the clear understanding that they will be voted out in the next election or recalled by their district if they don&rsquo;t implement them, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this problem.  I don&rsquo;t care if their campaigns are founded by the oligarchy or not.  </p>
<p>We need to demand a freeze on all immigration, legal and illegal.  We need to rescind the birthright loophole and make it retroactive to any child born of anyone who was living here illegally.  We need to impose e-verify to make it impossible for anyone who was not born here to get welfare benefits.  I don&rsquo;t care if an immigrant has a green card or has become a naturalized citizen, if they can&rsquo;t support themselves, they need to be deported.  We need to mandate e-verify to get housing and employment and impose draconian fines and prison sentences to any one foolish enough to hire or house them.</p>
<p>Once we do so, the illegal aliens will realize the jig is up, pack their brats and their things and head home.  This idea of &#8220;reconqusista&#8221; is nonsense.  The dopish American taxpayer is funding this movement, not Meheecoo or any little brown berets either.  </p>

<p>If illegals are made legal due to the whinings of these groups and these particular individuals,,,when it comes time to vote, they ARE NOT gonna remember John McCain, John Kerry, Kennedy OR Obamaster, they are gonna remember MIGUEL PEREZ for congress, senate or POTUS or some other once illegal!

		<p>Meanwhile, Italy is introducing legislation that stipulates a point system for immigrants.  Immigrants have three years to earn the necessary points to stay in the country. Points are awarded for such things as learning the Italian language, joining the national health system, and taking civic education courses.  Points are taken away for criminal offenses. </p>
<p>Who knows if the bill will pass and how effectively it will be implemented (just being realistic here, this is Italy), but it&rsquo;s interesting that the pendulum of public opinion on immigration already seems to be swinging the other way in Italy.</p>

		<p>I agree wholeheartedly with poster #5.</p>
<p>I work in a major urban district that is 80% black and Latino and some Asian.  Over the last few years, the white liberals have literally dropped blacks and their issues in favor of latinos and immigration &#8216;reform&rsquo;.  Why? because in their eyes latinos are so small, cute and amenable to their efforts with little fear of violence.</p>
<p>I have seen this at the local and city-wide level.  Latinos in general have no respect for blacks and I have heard many latinos personallay complain about all the affirmative action programs for blacks.  They disparage them saying &#8216;why don&rsquo;t they work&rsquo; and &#8216;why do they get everything for free?&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Now latinos are a bigger share (and growing) of the local electorate and do you think they and the growing asian community are going to be easy to manipulate for black set-asides?</p>
<p>Immigration has been terrible for black folks and now that more and more blacks are realizing this, it is too late.  Latinos and asians have come and occupied the rungs on top of them in the ladder of society.  Whites are even more out of reach than ever, and our numbers are receeding so one day blacks will be at the mercy of a alrgely latino America, and how do blacks fair in latino countries?  Small, underclass persecuted minority with no mercy shown.  (There are blacks in every central american and south american country.) </p>

<p>Always throw the raciasm charge back at the Left and the Liberals.</p>
<p>Either NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS become openly highly racialized in their politcs or they will replaced at the  hands of post-1965 hispanics,asians muslims,africans and tthe anti-white Kenyan bigot in the White House.</p>

		<p>I wonder when we&rsquo;re all going to realize that illegal immigration is BIG business for politicians who need votes and the support of the pro-illegal traitors, business owners salivating for cheap labor and individuals who need pool guys and maids? Of course it will never be settled. When the government keeps saying, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t deport 12 million,&#8221; what they mean they don&rsquo;t WANY to deport them and won&rsquo;t tell the truth that the number is closer to 25-30 million. We are no longer a nation of laws and will not be until every last illegal alien is out of here. Even if they aren&rsquo;t given amnesty, they will continue to stay and reap the benefits. We need to insist on the many ignored methods that would rid us of them.</p>

		<p>A sure way to get rid of a lot of illegals is a proposal that has already been made: formulate quick-check ID cards that must be cleared in a national data base before an employer can hire.  Pass laws that require prison time as well as large fines for anyone who hires an undocumented alien.  Then the illegals will be driven away because most employment opportunities will dry up.  Of course, powerful capitalists don&rsquo;t want this, anymore than the far left.  But if the American people will just demand that politicians back this idea, it can be achieved.  Populism can defeat money interests.<br>
And, as for the size of the Hispanic minority, it already edges out the blacks.  And whites are not doomed to be the next U.S. minority if they will act to halt non-white immigration and dissuade illegals from being here.</p>

		<p>What difference does amnesty make? Illegals are already allowed to be domiciled here, their children get preferential treatment in our colleges, anchor babies entitle them to welfare. They are largely immune to traffic stops- the cops just let them go. In addition they are given special mortgage rates in order to encourage diversity. Plus housing density laws do not apply to them. The Fed cries racism if there is even a hint at enforcement. Also they are largely allowed to vote. witness the election of the Sanchez sisters in Ca.Our goose is cooked; andthe illegals are chowing down.</p>

		<p>I just have a few questions about the illegal invasion of our country.  Maybe the readers can help me out.  Latinos are overwhelmingly Christian, correct?  How do they look upon Muslims then?  Is there any chance we could show people an analogy of what Muslim invaders are doing to Europe (and the US) is similar to what Latino invasion is doing to OUR country?  I suppose from the Latino prospective these scenarios are completely different?</p>

		<p>Washington knows that granting amnesty for Hispanic criminal invaders would be the catalyst that would instantly spark our second civil war.  </p>
<p>Removing the burgeoning Hispanic presence in America is vital for maintaining the white majority necessary for the continued survival of our language, heritage, culture and prosperity.  </p>
<p>Even without the passage of amnesty the continuing mass invasion of illegals will force us to implement the solution to the Hispanic problem&hellip;        </p>

Yes, the the self-righteous reaction of clueless liberals from our own end of the color spectrum would be a problem. But maybe those &#8220;weak-stomached whites&#8221; would be less inclined to complain about the &#8220;cruelty&#8221; of deportation if we explained it this way: </p>
<p><br>
Your family is enjoying a nice Sunday dinner together. A cat from the neighborhood gets in your house through a hole in the screen door. The cat jumps up on your dinner table and immediately begins helping itself to your roast beef. Someone from your family picks the cat up off the table, carries it outside, and shuts not just the porous screen door but also the wooden door, so the problem won&rsquo;t happen again. </p>
<p>A cat got in where it doesn&rsquo;t belong, and now it&rsquo;s being gently returned to where it does belong. What&rsquo;s so &#8220;cruel&#8221; or &#8220;inhumane&#8221; about that? </p>

<p>Yes, of course, they did. But he promised them a lot! And I think that the way Obama&rsquo;s slogan &#8220;Yes, way can&#8221;, was quickly co-opted by the Latinos to become &#8220;Si se puede&#8221;, does say a lot about the hopes they had invested in him. </p>
<p>I think one of the most shameful things I ever saw was a video on YouTUbe, with Nancy Pelosi adressing an entire hall full of illegal immigrants, and beginning her speech by saying &#8220;I&rsquo;m really sorry that I can&rsquo;t speak to you in Spanish&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she was saying &#8220;Si se puede&#8221;, raising her fist in the air. </p>
<p>If I were a Democrat, I would find this very, very embarrassing! I mean, the House speaker is supposed to work for the US governement and the Amrican people, right? Not for Latino illegals, I suppose?</p>
