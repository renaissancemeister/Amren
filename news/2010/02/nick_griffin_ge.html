			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alistair MacDonald, Wall Street Journal, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nick Griffin, the leader of the far right British National Party, has found a country where it is even tougher to get heard than in his own  &mdash;  the U.S.</p>
<p>Griffin had lined up three venues to speak at this month in a visit to the U.S. But all three were canceled, leaving Griffin with a familiar feeling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the U.S., Griffin was set to speak at a conference hosted by American Renaissance, an online magazine for &#8220;race-realist information and perspectives,&#8221; outside of Washington. The conference was canceled when protesters made life miserable for hotels that had agreed to take American Renaissance&rsquo;s bookings, according to Jared Taylor, who helps run the magazine.</p>
<p>For Taylor, his British contact&rsquo;s difficulties in finding a U.S. podium are about freedom of speech. &#8220;This is not the kind of thing you would expect from the home of the brave and the land of the free,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Next up, a speaking engagement at Michigan State University was also canceled by the students who sent the invitation, a university spokesman said. The spokesman said he didn&rsquo;t have many other details.</p>
<p>A Griffin spokesman was sanguine, saying Griffin is very busy with his job as a member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Griffin is as unimpressed with the U.S. president. &#8220;For at the very heart of Barack Obama there is a deep-seated anti-white racism,&#8221; he said on his Web site. The BNP man&rsquo;s prediction for Obama&rsquo;s presidency is one of waste in which he will end up &#8220;increasing handouts to those he sees as &#8216;his people.&#8221; And for America itself, Griffin believes that as &#8220;its European-American founders become a minority in their own country&#8221; we will witness the death of &#8220;America as anything other than a geographical expression.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Griffin&rsquo;s prognosis for America&rsquo;s future is both grim and realistic.  Barring some sort of unforseeable intervention, this nation will be overwhelmed by its unproductive and criminal classes, which have already achieved a privileged status which gains strength every day.</p>

		<p>I think one of the reasons the leftist goon squads got this year&rsquo;s regular AR conference cancelled was the planned appearance of Nick Griffin. They saw the appearance of a prominent elected British public official as lending an air of legitimacy to American Renaissance that it absolutely CANNOT have!! AR absolutely MUST remain an obscure organization!</p>
<p>By the same token, Nick Griffin CANNOT be allowed to speak at any American School or university! If he does, students will discover that he doesn&rsquo;t have horns and breathe fire! They might even discover that a lot of what he says makes perfect sense, even though much of it is the exact opposite of what they have been taught their whole lives. That is something they absolutely cannot allow to happen. They will have to destroy him, just as they did to William Shockley and nearly did to James Watson.</p>

		<p>Actually not a bad article. Of course the WSJ simply MUST insinuate that Nick is a Nazi who hates blacks etc. That is de riguer thinking for all journo-hacks. But they do let Nick speak and and the Griffin quote nails the problem squarely.<br>

		<p>Former Yugoslavia.  Former Soviet Union.  Former Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Former Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Former United States.  Hmmm, has a familiar ring to it, don&rsquo;t ya think? Are the Bushes our Hapsburgs?  Or are they more akin to Mikhail Gorbechev?  Or perhaps they are like Admiral Yamamoto, just too arrogant to face reality?  Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have an Emperor to put an end to the nonsense.  </p>
<p>The United States will only exist on old maps in history books, sort of like the ones that show the boundaries of the Spanish Empire in the 18th century.  In fact the globe I received as a little kid in the very early 1960s has a number of countries throughout the world marked with &#8220;BR&#8221;, &#8220;SP&#8221;, &#8220;PORT&#8221;, and &#8220;FR&#8221; indicating that they are British, Spanish, Portuguese and French colonies or dependencies.  The world changes.<br>

		<p>A few years ago Nick Griffin spoke at Texas A &amp; M in College-Bryan Station.  The roomed was overflowing with students, and even a fair number of lefties.  During the question and answer session some leftist (an instructor, I surmised by her age) stood up supposedly to ask Mr. Griffin a question, but it soon became apparent that she had no intention of letting Mr. Griffin complete an answer, and as she continued to interrupt him, I decided to cut her off.  </p>
<p>I jumped up, turned around and barked at her, &#8220;You asked your question, now shut up and let him answer! We didn&rsquo;t come here to hear you rant and rave!&#8221;  Our eyes met, and the look on her face was one of absolute shock.  In that moment she knew that I was serious as a heart attack, and had she continued I (and undoubtedly Preston) would have closed in on her, gotten in her face, and escorted her from the room. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we&rsquo;re entering a new phase in our struggle here in the United States. Establishing firm control over our venue is a necessity.  There is already discussion behind the scenes of pooling funds and purchasing a hotel just for such a purpose. </p>

		<p>Nick Griffin&rsquo;s accomplishments are nothing short of miraculous. Thank you, Nick, for all you&rsquo;ve done, for all you&rsquo;re going to do, and for the stately way you carry about it every day.</p>
<p>The BNP is weathering the storm on that nefarious Equal Rights nonsense, and it is due to Nick&rsquo;s pragmatic leadership and big-picture approach. Such a setback would scuttle many other small movements and parties, but Nick and his constituents have built a coalition to last.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is nothing we can do to protect our people&rsquo;s future, but at least there are gentlemen such as Griffin and Jared Taylor to keep me sane as it all burns down around us.</p>

		<p>While it&rsquo;s not pleasant to see the steady and accelerating reduction of those of European background in the the U.S. to minority status, I think that at some point enough of this newest minority group will wake up to what&rsquo;s going on. If smaller percentage united minority groups can &#8220;play political hardball&#8221;, then if European-Americans become finally united we should be able to get more of what we want as the largest minority group among a nation of minorities.</p>
<p>However, I do not see this as eventually working itself out within &#8220;the forty yard lines&#8221; of politics, but unfortunately any kind of white awakening will likely bring on the kind of political forces that have always historically led to civil war. At that point God knows what could happen.</p>

		<p>The United States ceased being a nation with the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, which allowed the flooding of this country with non White immigrants. A nation is defined as a common people.</p>
<p>The United States ceased being a country with the passage of the Reagan amnesty, which allowed granted Amnesty to foreign invaders. A country is defined as a geographical area, with borders and a central government. </p>
<p>The United States is now just a geographical area. It no longer has a common people or enforced borders.</p>
