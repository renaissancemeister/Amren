			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lucy Ballinger, Daily Mail (London), February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Christian teacher yesterday claimed he was forced out of his job after complaining that Muslim pupils as young as eight hailed the September 11 hijackers as heroes.</p>
<p>Nicholas Kafouris, 52, is suing his former school for racial discrimination.</p>
<p>He told a tribunal that he had to leave his £30,000-a-year post because he would not tolerate the &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;anti-Semitic&rsquo; behaviour of Year 4 pupils.</p>
<p>The predominantly Muslim youngsters openly praised Islamic extremists in class and described the September 11 terrorists as &#8216;heroes and martyrs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>One pupil said: &#8216;Don&rsquo;t touch me, you&rsquo;re a Christian&rsquo; when he brushed against him.</p>
<p>Others said: &#8216;We want to be Islamic bombers when we grow up&rsquo;, and &#8216;The Christians and Jews are our enemies  &mdash;  you too because you&rsquo;re a Christian&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris, a Greek Cypriot, taught for 12 years at Bigland Green Primary School in Tower Hamlets, East London.</p>
<p>According to Ofsted &#8216;almost all&rsquo; its 465 pupils are from ethnic minorities and a vast proportion do not speak English as a first language.</p>
<p>The teacher claims racial discrimination by the school, its headmistress and her assistant head after they failed to take action about the comments made by pupils to him.</p>
<p>He said there was a change in attitude of the pupils after the atrocities of September 11, 2001. They told him: &#8216;We hate the Christians&rsquo; and &#8216;We hate the Jews&rsquo;, despite his attempts to stop them.</p>
<p>He said he filled out a Racist Incident Reporting Sheet but claimed headmistress Jill Hankey dismissed his concerns.</p>
<p>In a statement submitted to the Central London Employment Tribunal he said: &#8216;Miss Hankey proceeded to excuse and justify the pupil&rsquo;s behaviour, conduct and remarks to me as if I had no right to be offended by the child&rsquo;s remarks and conduct.</p>
<p>&#8216;Amongst Miss Hankey&rsquo;s justifications for the child&rsquo;s remarks, she said, &#8220;If the child was older, say 15, I might take it more seriously. He&rsquo;s only nine  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s only doing it to wind you up&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;I felt the head&rsquo;s behaviour and conduct towards me amounted to direct religious discrimination. I was intimidated in the way she spoke to me which indicated &#8220;Don&rsquo;t come back with such issues again&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris, a bachelor, said the comments became more frequent after the head did nothing about the initial incidents.</p>
<p>&#8216;In late November and December 2006, a number of unacceptable and blunt racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian remarks were being made by various children in Year 4 where I taught, such as, &#8220;The Twin Tower bombers are heroes and martyrs&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Some children were expressing delight at the death and killing of people of other cultures and religions.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the last week of November 2006 a child was talking about stabbing another child and I told him this was dangerous talk and that a lawyer had recently been stabbed by teenagers. His reply was, &#8220;I&rsquo;m glad that man died&#8221;. &#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Because he&rsquo;s a Christian and English and we&rsquo;re Muslim&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He claimed that during a religious education lesson about Jonah and the whale, one of the pupils asked if Jonah was a Jew, before shouting: &#8216;I hate the Jews, they&rsquo;re our enemies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris said he again tried to speak to Miss Hankey about it. &#8216;The head&rsquo;s response was hostile and offensive again. The very first thing she said to me was, &#8220;Oh, you again! You&rsquo;re the only teacher that reports these things! Nobody else does!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Four times she repeated, &#8220;It&rsquo;s because of your lack of discipline that they&rsquo;re saying these things&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Kafouris was signed off with stress by his GP at the end of February 2007 after assistant head Margaret Coleman warned him not to challenge the pupils in class about their remarks.</p>
<p>He says the lack of support from the school has made him clinically depressed and unable to work. He was sacked in April last year.</p>
<p>The case continues.<br>

		<p>My friends father was a teaching in a muslim district in Holland.  After asking the students to write about 9/11 and the assassination of Pim Fortuyn and Theo Van Gogh he took nearly all students essays right to the police.  This is a fight for our civilization and nothing less. Europe is not going to survive this so best to concentrate on the US.</p>

		<p>An honest decent man betrayed by two feminazis for daring to speak the truth  .Ms Hankey claims she did not take the abuse seriously because of the pupils age.  This has never been an obstacle to chastisement and expulsion when English children, (some as young as three) have been singled out as racist bullies when they have dared to stand up to their alien tormentors.  This case is a perfect illustration of the chaos that has emanated from the combined evils of the feminisation of primary  education,and the mass importation of people whose sole aim is to destroy the society they have entered. </p>

		<p>It sounds to me like the white English population could do with generous injections of testosterone!  Ms. Hankey (makes me wonder if her first name is Pankey) needs to be called to task on this one.  And America, read this story and get ready to fight - we have to save our own nation from the hostile takeover of some very arrogant and militaristic Muslims.  These people DO want to kill us - make no mistake about that.  If we allow it, they will take over this nation in 20 years by virtue of their birth rate alone (hence, those effing Muslims&hellip;)</p>

		<p>I would suggest people read Laurence Auster&rsquo;s collection on his writings on Islam. <br>

<p>He clearly shows that the problem is not that &#8216;good&rsquo; muslims do not speak out against &#8216;bad&rsquo; muslims or that extremists and terrorists have taken over the religion and all those foolish liberal theories. The fact is Islam itself is the problem. What is funny is that Islam is anti-liberal and yet liberals are unsure how to deal with it. They are just buying time but in the long run they are clueless how to deal with this ideology. For now they are happy that Islam will help them destroy the hated European/ Western civilization.</p>

		<p>This being the conduct and attitude of children, one can easily imagine the attitude of the millions of Pakistani muslims in Englandistan now. I know from British friends and other sources that Tower Hamlets is more than 90% Pakistani muslim and I believe it is where the muslims want to build a gigantic weapons/terror training/indoctrination building&hellip;OOPPPS I mean a gigantic mosque. </p>

		<p>Assuming this story is roughly accurate&hellip;which, by almost random views of Britain, is likely-then the whole Western world is awaiting complete anihilation as these kids grow up.<br>
Britain is a literal FACTORY for jihadists&hellip;who will do their murder so easily, because it&rsquo;s an &#8220;inside job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very idea of trying to track and prevent the entry of jihadists to Western countries is a very sick joke, seing as they are being fed, nurtured &amp; encouraged right here in the HEART of the West.<br>
Get that last nail for the coffin&hellip;it&rsquo;s time to put the body in the ground.<br>
RIP Western Civ.</p>

		<p>Do those idiots who forced this teacher out of his job even realize that those muslim students see them as their enemies too? This is why it&rsquo;s best to homeschool your kids. With all this forced multiculturalism and integration with muslims, public schools are becoming quite dangerous now.</p>

		<p>LONDON - (November 2009) Ranting Islamic hate preacher Anjem Choudary is planning to peddle his hate to teenagers at a &ldquo;jihad&rdquo; summer school. According to the Daily Star, this vile extremist has appointed himself principal lecturer of a 20-week course in his twisted version of Islam, and there are fears that Choudary and his followers will indoctrinate a new generation of Muslim fanatics. The minimum age advertised is 15, but his School of Shari&rsquo;ah has promised to consider even younger students. They will learn about the Islamic &ldquo;struggle&rdquo; and how to enter the &ldquo;Gardens of Paradise&rdquo;. Tory MP Philip Davies, 37, said: &ldquo;This is appalling. We know what this character is like and the kinds of things he will be saying. We need summer schools to encourage people to integrate into British society. The last thing we need is individuals like this spreading their poison and indoctrinating more people into their cause.&rdquo; Choudary, 41, has joined fellow fanatics to set up the School of Shari&rsquo;ah, based in east London.

		<p>At university here in Great Britain, I met a young woman who was a teacher. It was at a cafe run by a lesbian charity, so you can bet that the media stereotype of the &#8220;uneducated closed-minded bigot&#8221; was off the table, but she grimly recounted the comments of the Muslim students in her primary class, and remarked on their utter vileness.</p>
<p>They routinely praised Hitler as a hero for &#8220;killing the Jews&#8221;, they just loved the 9/11 hijackers, and believed gays and lesbians should be executed, and said as much.</p>
<p>They got this from their parents, of course, who are guests of our nation. And the men in the high towers still tell us that it&rsquo;s wrong to think it terms of &#8220;them and us&#8221;.</p>
<p>I forget where I read it, probably here, but this is a war we&rsquo;re not even allowed to know we&rsquo;re fighting. </p>

		<p>Compare with this other stories about white, Christian students being arrested or suspended (I believe there were at least two cases) for saying &#8216;racist&rsquo; things or in the case of a suspension, refusing to face Mecca prostrate (the leftist teacher claimed it was just to teach about Islamic practices).  In one case a 9 year old girl was detained by the police for refusing to study with Pakistanis. </p>
