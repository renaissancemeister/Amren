			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Hale, Daily Mail (London), February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A devout Hindu grandfather has won the right to be cremated on a traditional &#8216;open air&rsquo; funeral pyre when he dies.</p>
<p>Davender Ghai, 71, believes that the tradition of open-air cremation is essential to the liberation of his soul after death.</p>
<p>But his local authority  &mdash;  and the Ministry of Justice  &mdash;  contended that the ancient practice of &#8216;natural cremation&rsquo;, widely carried out in other parts of the world breached the 1902 Cremation Act.</p>
<p>Today, however, London&rsquo;s Court of Appeal said that the spiritual healer and respected charity leader&rsquo;s heartfelt request could be accommodated under existing law.</p>
<p>The landmark ruling means that thousands of Hindus, Sikhs  &mdash;  and anyone else wanting &#8216;natural cremation&rsquo;  &mdash;  can be content that their dying wishes can legally be carried out.</p>
<p>It opens the way for building new crematoria with a hole in the roof to meet the requirements of the faiths. At present no suitable site for Mr Ghai to be cremated exists.</p>
<p>Mr Ghai, a father of three from Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, said today he was &#8216;overjoyed&rsquo; by the decision.</p>
<p>&#8216;I never doubted justice would be done but, in all honesty, I often feared that my health would fail me before the legal journey had ended.</p>
<p>&#8216;This case was truly a matter of life and death for me and today&rsquo;s verdict has breathed new life into an old man&rsquo;s dreams.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Ghai, a British citizen who came to England from Kenya in 1958 to study, added: &#8216;Both my father and grandfather proudly served in the British Army in Kenya and I myself have devoted the best years of my life in voluntary service to Britain&rsquo;s poor, desperate and lonely.</p>
<p>&#8216;I never wanted to be divisive or offend anyone, the Britain I have loved for over half a century is a tolerant &#8220;live and let  live&#8221; nation and the verdict is a victory for those values.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Ghai&rsquo;s attempt to establish the first approved site in the UK for the 4,000-year-old spiritual ceremony was first blocked four years ago by Newcastle City Council, which said the pyres were unlawful.</p>
<p>The local authority&rsquo;s decision was upheld at the High Court last year, when the Ministry of Justice argued that &#8216;a large proportion of the population of the United Kingdom would be upset and offended and would find it abhorrent if human remains were burned on open-air pyres&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The pensioner, who has a number of health problems,  had said the council&rsquo;s cremation facilities were a &#8216;waste disposal process devoid of spiritual significance&rsquo;.</p>
<p>By contrast, he compared the liberation of the soul in consecrated fire to a sacramental rebirth, &#8216;like the mythical phoenix arising from the flames anew&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Determined Mr Ghai appealed and yesterday he won his four-year battle.</p>
<p>Delivering the ruling Master of the Rolls, Lord Neuberger said: &#8216;It seems to us that Mr Ghai&rsquo;s religious and personaI beliefs as to how his remains should be cremated once he dies can be accommodated within current cremation legislation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the end the ruling came down not to human rights but to the question of what constitutes a building.</p>
<p>The court was told that Mr Ghai wanted a funeral pyre of wood that should be open to the sky,  but the site could be surrounded by walls and the pyre covered with a roof which had an opening.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice said this was not a building, which was a structure bounded by walls with a roof, and the law was there to protect &#8216;decorum and decency&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But three of the country&rsquo;s top judges disagreed, ruling that the Ministry of Justice definition of a building was too narrow.</p>
<p>All Mr Ghai wanted was a traditional fire and for the sun to be able to fall on his body and this could be carried out in a purpose-built crematorium within the law, they said.</p>
<p>Mr Ghai, the founder of the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society (AAFS), said he had been left &#8216;virtually penniless&rsquo; fighting the case. But now he hopes to submit proposals for a natural cremation site and has already been offered land.</p>
<p>He said his request had often been &#8216;misinterpreted&rsquo;, leading many to believe he wanted to be cremated in an open field, but he always accepted buildings were &#8216;appropriate&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said his dream now was that such site would be &#8216;open to everyone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His own dearest wish is that his eldest son should light the funeral pyre while the rest of his family watches as his soul is released from his body into the afterlife.</p>
<p>He wants his ashes to be carried to India and immersed in the Ganges.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said that the difficulties which may be thrown up by planning and public health legislation, should an application be submitted, had not been considered as part of the judgment.</p>
<p>They said the method of burning associated with funeral pyres was not covered by any regulations which currently only apply to cremators powered by gas or electricity which are designed to maintain environmental standards, in particular air quality.</p>
<p>&#8216;Following the judgment, all local authorities will await further guidance from the Home Office and Defra as regards any proposed regulations or legislation which may control the proposed manner of cremation to ensure environmental standards and public health are protected,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p><b>So Why Open-Air Cremation?</b></p>
<p>Many Hindus believe open air cremations are vital to give the dead an unimpeded path to reincarnation. Instructions are found in the Satapatha Brahmana, scriptures dating from 900 to 600BC.</p>
<p>The ritual takes place in three distinct parts. The first is the actual cremation, which includes the actual or symbolic breaking of the skull to aid the release of the soul.</p>
<p>Cremation is followed by a second ceremony, called the Havan, at a temple where a fire is lit, fragrant herbs scattered on the pyre and holy words chanted before the ashes are collected when cool. In India, bodies are traditionally burned on pyres beside the Ganges, the Hindus&rsquo; holiest river.</p>
<p>Once the ashes have cooled they are collected and relatives scatter the ashes in the river to unite fire, wind, earth and water.</p>
<p>Where ceremonies cannot be held by the river, the bodies are burnt in the families&rsquo; home towns before the ashes are transported to the Ganges.</p>
<p>Open air cremations are also widely practised in the Sikh faith.</p>
<p>On a hillside outside Brighton a marble memorial stands on a spot where 53 Hindu and Sikh soldiers who died fighting in World War I were cremated outdoors.</p>
<p>In 1934 the Home Office authorised the cremation in Woking of a Nepalese princess.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal ruling is thought likely to make the UK the only country in western Europe to allow natural cremations, which are permitted in 27 countries across the world including 15 where neither Hindus or Buddhists  &mdash;  who also traditionally use funeral pyres  &mdash;  form the majority of the population.</p>
<p>Funeral pyres are permitted for Aboriginal cremations in Australia and also in two American states, Colorado and Vermont.</p>
<p>Four years ago, in a farmer&rsquo;s field in Northumberland, a 31-year-old Sikh man was cremated after Mr Ghai agreed to help the Indian man&rsquo;s family.<br>

		<p>This article does not offend me, as I understand the customs in India.  Householders must be cremated, open air.  Spiritual teachers, gurus, real Brahmins (the caste of spirituality) must be buried with honors.  Open cremation and quick disposition of ashes is a very practical way of handling an ugly problem.  With all the dead folks who are found in the gutters of the cities in India every day, they have to have a quick and clean way of disposal.  If they didn&rsquo;t have open air cremation, horrific conditions would soon exist.  What&rsquo;s so awful about allowing it in other countries?  It is a quick and clean way to dispose of the dead, without taking up more room in the earth.  If you&rsquo;ve ever lived near a crematorium, you know when the black smoke goes up, they&rsquo;re doing a cremation.  That&rsquo;s just the way it is.  I WAS raised near a cemetery/crematorium, and we never thought anything about it.  No big deal.</p>

		<p>The group MOVE some years ago now in Philly left the dead body of a small child out in the open for a natural disposal. Called themselves [MOVE] a &#8220;back to nature&#8221; movement. When the cops were called, a stand off began that resulted in one cop being shot and killed and four firemen wounded.</p>
<p>Sky Burial too has become popular in some circles. As seen in the movie &#8220;Kundun&#8221;. Your body is chopped into pieces and the vultures are called. Then after bones are picked clean, the bones are ground into powder and mixed with meat, made into a meat ball, and then the vultures are called again. The next day all that is left of you is a white splatter on the rocks near the vultures nest. Of course, in Britain, you have no vultures.</p>
<p>Beetles do a good job of picking bones clean as well. Novel idea.</p>

		<p>a better question is, why did this guy, allegedly, bankrupted himself on this lawsuit instead of buying one way ticket to India when he is close to death? Wouldn&rsquo;t living his final days there be a nice, inoffensive, low cost way to solve the problem without being a dick to everybody in his adopted country?</p>

		<p>Quite right,it is acceptable,in india!the question is where will it end,they will now demand such facilities in every area in my country,which will be suffused by this stink,in the same way we had mosques forced on us under the pretext that muslims were such a tiny minority that we would not notice,and today we have thousands of them.so it is only a matter of time before we have charnel houses on the banks of our rivers presided over by agouri.if they wish to be primitive india is the place for them,not England.</p>

		<p>If this guy wants to be cremated and it means so much to him, why doesn&rsquo;t he just go back to India and do it there.  He has lived in England since 1958 and has enjoyed its hospitality for that long but you see, he like many of these immigrants has never assimilated.  It is a good argument for putting a cap on legal immigration and stopping illegal immigration in our own country.  These Hindus, Sikhs, or whatever are very strange to us with their customs and cultures.  Where will all of this finally end? Aren&rsquo;t Sikh boys given a dagger to wear when they turn twelve years old? A white Boy Scout was suspended from school because he had a 2&#8221; penknife in the trunk of his car, but I&rsquo;m sure if he was a Sikh wearing his weapon into class the American Civil Liberties Union would have defended him in court(at taxpayer expense, of cours).  </p>
<p>I have gone to the UK several times to take in the historical sights because we are so linked to them from the very beginning.  I wanted to meet English people but actually saw far too few in London.  You walk along Edgeware Road around the corner from the Marble Arch and you see Arab cafes, one after another, whose sidewalk tables are mounted with three-foot-tall hookahs, and the Arab men seated there smoking seem to question what is that white man doing here.  You go to Buckingham Palace to see the changing of the guard, and you are lost in a maddening sea of Asians, Nigerians, and the Continental tourists, beneficiares of the exchange rates, crowding the streets and monuments.  It might be 90 degrees in the shade but the Muslim women are covered from head to toe in black burqas and head scarves.  This is not the England I was hoping to see.  Maybe it is different in the smaller towns and villages.  I&rsquo;m not sure, but even in Oxford the Muslims want to build a tower so their people can be called to prayer.  It will change the whole character of the town with its colleges and churches dating back centuries.  I think the English elites have lost their country.  </p>

		<p>We have environmentalists telling us what we can eat, drive and wear, and going on about the latest &#8216;koto accord&rsquo; or global warming white-guilt facts, yet no one at all is suggesting something like creamation be an option for the Earth&rsquo;s 10 billion population when it comes to the end. </p>

		<p>If I were in Mister Ghai&rsquo;s place, I would have left Britain, to live the remainder of my days in India. There, open air cremation is the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>That would have made more sense, I think, than gowing pratically bankrupt, to have the money to engage in a legal battle with the authorities, in a country where customs (and laws) are very different, form what they are in India.</p>
<p>But, again, we see a case of the host society changing its own laws to accomodate a foreigner&hellip; </p>
<p>It should be the other way around!</p>

		<p>As a regular to this site, I guess I am really starting to get tired of all the sympathetic praises in regards to Indians.  I don&rsquo;t understand what is so wonderful about Indians as immigrants.  They leave a primitive country looking down on the white natives of their respective host nations wherever they immigrate to.  </p>
<p>Is this arrogance warranted?  Not in the least. They may have a small percentage of their population that is intelligent, and those may be the ones who come here, but a small percentage out of a nation of 1 billion people is hardly impressive, even if that small percentage is &#8220;large&#8221; numerically by our standards.  </p>
<p>And it is not as if the white countries need them.  Goodness gracious&hellip;how in the world did we make it to the moon and split the atom without them?</p>
<p>Enough with this pandering garbage!  I don&rsquo;t care if they are better than blacks and Muslims (which isn&rsquo;t saying much)&hellip;.they AREN&rsquo;T white and they don&rsquo;t belong in our nations, period.  Our countries have suffered enough from Third World immigrants so why are we still wasting our time making excuses for Indians who come?  </p>
<p>Enough with this!  It is time to be man enough to take our countries back for good! </p>

<p>What exactly is your great contribution to our civilization? Did you help split the atom or put anyone on the moon? Have you done anything of even remote significance? It&rsquo;s really sad that you make up for your own lack of accomplishment by leeching off those of others.</p>

<p>Good for you Courtney!! Indian immigrants tend to be over represented in the professions and barely functional,not nearly as good as whites and hispanics whatever their job.</p>
<p>My brother had his hip replacement done at the world famous Mayo clinic in Minnesota.  He, at age 63 was infected with hepatitis C, the worst kind at the Mayo clinic.  What was the vector?  The usual suspect who infects patients with hep C, E.coli and shagella, an Indian immigrasnt physician who arives in this country infected and doesn&rsquo;t bother to wash his or her hands.</p>
<p>As a RN, I can tell you that on the average, Indian health care workers from physicians to nurse&rsquo;s aides expertise ranges from mediocore competence to incompetent.</p>
<p>The computer programmers are on the average not as good as the native American programmers who the companies just refuse to hire because they are American men. </p>
<p>Most of you have heard of Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.  You can&rsquo;t help it, Cedars has a mass of public relations people constantly planting articles on how great Cedars is.</p>
<p>An Indian immigrant woman physician who worked in the premature, severely defective, at great risk infants section infected many babies with TB, E.coli, shagella, Hep C and numerous other diseases because she came to this country infected and did not wash her hands.  Her TB stick came up positive, xray showed she had lesions on her lungs and Cedars still allowed her to work with those tiny, fragile 2 pound at high risk babies.</p>
<p>And nothing was done to remove her when it became obvious who infected the babies.  The parents removed the babies to other hospitals.  Cedars did not remove the Indian female disease carrier.</p>
<p>Believe me, Indian physical and respiratory therapists, physicians, dentists, nurses,and other medical technicians are no better than average and in many cases below average in their job performance.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need them  Get young Americans out of their useless liberal arts college classes and into health care schools and we won&rsquo;t need any of these immigrants.</p>

		<p>15 Fizzix: What exactly is your great contribution to our civilization, Fizzix?  I know you didn&rsquo;t help split the atom or put anyone on the moon.  What have you done?  <br>
     Did Courtney claim to have split the atom or put men on the moon?  No, her use of the word &#8220;we&#8221; obviously refers to the White race collectively.  Your accusing her of leeching personal credit for those accomplishments is indicative of dishonesty or a poor grasp of the English language.  <br>
     <br>
If you&rsquo;re not a Hindu Brahmin, you sound like one.  Are only the most highly trained engineers allowed to make contributions to society?  May only PhDs have opinions?  Are competent people in less exalted positions of no value?  I have no idea what Courtney does for a living, maybe she&rsquo;s a dentist, maybe she&rsquo;s a hairdresser, but whatever she does, what bearing has that on her observations?  <br>
     My experience with ordinary Third Worlders is that they are typically on a par with White trash, and thus well below ordinary White workers.  Their dullness and carelessness are a burden to capable Whites who are stuck dealing with them.  Roofing may not be the most highly respected line of work, by fools and intellectuals anyways, but a society where the roofers do mediocre work is a society where the physicists will have to spread plastic over their computers to keep them dry.  A society with ignorant welders and slipshod machinists is a society whose aircraft I&rsquo;d rather not fly in, no matter how smart a few people at the top might be.  <br>
     Courtney is absolutely right that we don&rsquo;t need any Hindus in this country.  We don&rsquo;t need their caste arrogance, we don&rsquo;t need their pitiful masses, and we don&rsquo;t even need their technological assistance.  We did just fine before they ever set foot here.  </p>
