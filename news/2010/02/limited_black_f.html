<h1>Limited Black Film Genre Fosters Stereotypes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aisha N. Harris, Hartford Courant, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The problem is simple: Stories concerning black people, along with every other minority, are so few and far between and so often feel repetitive in setting and plot that they automatically come to represent all black people.</p>
<p>Months before either film was released, the trailers for &#8220;Precious,&#8221; an independent film with a black director, and Disney&rsquo;s &#8220;Princess,&#8221; a traditional, hand-drawn animated feature, had many at odds over how their subject matter was going to influence black and white audiences, many of them under the age of 10 in Disney&rsquo;s case. No stranger to criticism regarding racial cliches, the cultural juggernaut had to make sure its subject matter was treated with sensitivity. The princess&rsquo;s name was changed from Maddy, seen by some as a slave name, to Tiana, a much more black-sounding moniker. Others despaired over Tiana&rsquo;s romance with a much fairer skinned prince from a far-off, imagined country. They wondered why Disney would be reluctant to give its first black princess an equally black-looking prince.</p>
<p>Raina Kelley of Newsweek was wary about embracing &#8220;Precious&#8221; because she worries about &#8220;the fact that black people have begun to accept as unchangeable the lot of those stuck in the ghetto.&#8221; And although many, including the film&rsquo;s executive producers Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, deemed the movie uplifting and inspirational, the glimmer of hope is hard to see when the movie concludes with Precious living in a halfway house and infected with HIV from her father who raped her and left her with two children, as Courtland Milloy of The Washington Post so pointedly noted.</p>
<p>For blacks, it&rsquo;s a dangerous thing, being considered a niche. It means you won&rsquo;t get the respect or the quality or the budgets from filmmakers that audiences expect and deserve. It means that those in charge of distributing films have a limited view of what the audience wants to see and stick to a proven formula instead of aiming for multiple views and new stories. {snip}</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to be learned from this incessant cycle of movies that are supposed to epitomize and satisfy the urban market, it is that the black community will not unanimously be satisfied by the release of a black-centered story every few months {snip}. Although there is a black culture that is shared among a large sector of the nation, it is imperative that we recognize that racial minorities do not make up a figurative amoeba, all singularly moving, thinking, feeling or wanting the same things.</p>
<p>{snip} The reason why all critical eyes dart to movies such as &#8220;Precious&#8221; or &#8220;The Princess&#8221; is not merely because of standout performances or great storytelling  &mdash;  it is also because they are the only major movies with black leading characters from 2009 to receive that kind of interest. Since its inception, Hollywood has offered audiences slim pickings when it comes to stories by and about minorities. If there were 10 times as many stories in movies, then maybe people wouldn&rsquo;t be so quick to jump to one film&rsquo;s portrayal of black people because there would be a range of ideas to choose from.</p>

		<p>If a non black portrays a black person as a stereotype then it is discriminatory, if the same non black portrays a black person as an archetypical white character then it&rsquo;s condescending, inauthentic, unrealistic, patronising, optimistic projection whatever, take your pick.</p>
<p>Let blacks portray themselves as the same stereotypes or perpetual victims and take their ideas to the big (or little) screen.<br>
I believe as the saying goes &#8220;give em enough rope and they&rsquo;ll hang&rsquo;em selves.&#8221; <br>
So as far I&rsquo;m concerned use the studio&rsquo;s money and let the marketplace decide whether it fly&rsquo;s or not.<br>
Just don&rsquo;t expect charity or miracles and if no one wants to see your films don&rsquo;t cry racism.</p>
<p>Probably just means that in a few years time Obama will be bailing out the movie studios too.</p>
<p>On a side note, last night when I was channel flicking on our five of our  &#8216;free to air&rsquo; channels (or commercial TV channels).<br>
Black shows were on three of the five of them, I kid you not.<br>
Our non Whites find that it&rsquo;s somehow good for their self esteem too.</p>

		<p>Every white person I know adopts &#8216;black&rsquo; mannerisms, and mouths the black cliches as if by doing so they feel they can intimidate (non-conforming) whites, too. It&rsquo;s kind of funny when suburban kids do this around whites from the inner-city. I somehow suspect the black viewpoint is being expressed in Hollywood &#8216;even when there are not enough blacks&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Filmmakers generally are required to make films that people want to see.  People go to movies that they have an interest in.  Sometimes producers have an agenda, and if they have deep pockets or supported to bankroll them, they can make films that are not widely popular.  Hollywood makes lots of films with black actors.  How many gazillion films has denzel or will smith made in the past 15 years?  Quite a few.  Then there are all those black genre films like stomp the yeard, etc&hellip;  Avatar featured aliens patterned after black people, and they were the &#8220;good&#8221; guys.</p>
<p>What kinds of films are these black critics calling for?  Most &#8220;white&#8221; movies are genre films and none to brilliant.  Should I lament this as a sign that Hollywood is making tired formula films about whites?  Do they want more exposure by black actors?  What is the percentage of blacks in the population of this land?  15% or so.  I think that at least 15% of the movies made (give or take a few %) either have black actors in them, or have black leads.  If they want more films than their proportion of the population, then isn&rsquo;t is preferences?</p>
<p>No one is stopping black directors from making films.  Just because they usually flop at the box office is no sign of racism.  Plenty of white-made films flop too.  Movie producers and their corporate offices make movies that will make money.  There is no racism involved.  </p>
<p>Black people should be happy they get so much exposure in so many genres, even Greek mythology now (where there never were any blacks).  Think about it.  When was the last time you saw a movie with an Asian character that wasn&rsquo;t horribly stereotyped as either a kung fu master or a sex kitten?  </p>

		<p>I keep thinking of that OnStar commercial, where the cop tracks down a stolen suburban.  &#8220;I&rsquo;ll blink the lights&#8221; the supposed dispatcher (who knew OnStar had a direct line right into some cops radio?) says.  &#8220;OK, got him&#8221;.  The car then pulls over, safely albeit, to the side of the road.  I&rsquo;m still waiting for both car doors to open and the &#8220;perpetrator/s&#8221; to flee.  With the nice blacked out windows on said suburban, the orderly way they pull to the side of the road, we can only guess as to what they are hinting at.</p>

		<p>Tyler Perry is one black director that is mostly unknown in the white community. His films all have made money and opened at number 1 at the box office. Spike Lee and other blacks refer to his films negatively as sterotyping but he knows who his audience is which is Southern black churchgoers and makes films that they pay money to go to see. Unlike Spike Lee, he also owns all of his films and his own studios. Lionsgate distributes his films.</p>

		<p>On TV blacks are invariably portrayed as doctors, police chiefs, generals, heads of government crime labs, etc.  But never as the bad guy.  So I agree that the media is filled with egregious and inaccurate stereotypes.<br>

		<p>Especially liked are those movies made by blacks for blacks where the &#8220;hero&#8221; is involved in some sort of &#8220;scam&#8221; or plan where he does not hurt anyone but makes off with the big &#8220;score&#8221;.</p>
<p>And especially those where the &#8220;hero&#8221; is sorely and unjustly set upon by the mafia or crooked white cops, the &#8220;hero&#8221; being able to put one over on the white boys and get away with the swag, clean and neat.</p>

		<p>In UK there are many MBA&rsquo;s and we see them every day. Mandatory Black Actors. They are a never ending source of scorn and amusement. The furniture companies which advertise regularly on TV have a black man laying on a bed or couch alongside a White blond woman. Never a black woman alongside a White man unless she has plenty of &#8216;White&rsquo; in her and certainly not a typical overweight black woman with huge earrings and wallpaper nails. The black man is always neatly dressed as &#8216;White&rsquo; and never a bling laden, baggy pants rasta. Many TV series have MBA&rsquo;s portraying the senior administrator, head surgeon, chief fire officer or big technical scientist hero saving the world from a global catastrophe. Just who sweeps the floors, empties the garbage and washes cars, ambulances and fire engines is a bit of a mystery as there is an obvious lack of black workers. Even our regular live studio debates begin with a camera audience scan and there they are again.. always a couple of neat muslim women with nice headscarves who speak perfect English and are always selected to make their point about the merits of islam and never about the negatives. The black males have good jobs and do not claim welfare. They love to discuss race but little else and stress that they are married and living at home with the wife and kids, but this contrasts against real life and serves only to remind us of the truth. These people are MBA&rsquo;s in all but name. The religious team predictably waffle on about world peace, racial harmony and starving sick kids in some country somewhere or other with a non-White dictator running the place. I saw &#8216;Precious&rsquo; and thought it a genuine, thought provoking movie. Of course it was about black life, stark and realistic, and that point came through extremely well. I did wonder about the black actors and how they handled the subject matter from a personal viewpoint outside the movie set but, there again, there have been many &#8216;White&rsquo; films with similar or parallel stories. If blacks want to make their own movies, so be it, but if non-one wants to watch them or they are slammed by the critics and lose money, be adult enough not to blame racism for the failure as there are sufficient blacks around to pay the admission charge and then buy the DVD. Don&rsquo;t blame me, there are plenty of terrible movies around that I elect not to view and a don&rsquo;t give a toss who made them.</p>

<p>And they always have formula pieces for blacks that show them either overcoming white racism or the daunting odds of the ghetto. Sometimes <b>they invent black heroes out of wholecloth</b> like the Tuskegee Airmen, whose exploits were largely exaggerated to give black viewers an unjustified sense of self-worth. </p>

		<p>The idea of a Black film market is, I&rsquo;d suspect, more than a little overhyped. Other than crime films, what are Blacks really interested in? How many Blacks patronize the fine arts, the museums in various cities&hellip; much less support those museums with &#8220;contributions?&#8221; It&rsquo;s really a joke.</p>
<p>You might get a smathering of Black history museums during February (school-sponsored, with mandatory attendance). The rest of the year, if any visitors are seen&hellip; they&rsquo;re liberal White fools going through the ritual of self-abasement to expiate their imagined guilt. Well, I feel absolutely no guilt whatsoever, about Black slavery or subsequent discrimination. So I simply wouldn&rsquo;t waste my time at those museums. Nor would I ever pay a single dime to view a movie specifically intended for a Black audience. The noise (background music) alone would keep me miles away.</p>

		<p>Just like in real life, people like to go to movies to see actors and/or characters that they can identify with. White people do not identify with black actors, black story lines or black characters. Since it&rsquo;s white people who generate the revenue in the USA, movies that feature black leading actors or characters inevitably fail. TV is a joke; I agree that nowadays all you see are blacks in the roles of bosses, police chiefs and my personal favorite - judges! My kids and I have a great time making fun of movies and TV shows that portray black judges.</p>

		<p>When Blacks act as movie producers, you get movies that express the Black side of things.</p>
<p>I saw a movie by Mario Van Peebles called &#8220;Panther&#8221;, in which the Black Panthers of the 60&rsquo;s were shown as good guys, who were simply victims of the racist White establishment&hellip;</p>
<p>But when you dig a little, and do a little research, you find out that many Black Panthers had done time in jail before joining that party (actually it was more like a Black urban militia).</p>
<p>One of their leaders, Eldrige Cleaver, had raped many White And black women, before he joined the Panthers.</p>
<p>Then, there&rsquo;s also the movie &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221;, by Spike Lee, which doesn&rsquo;t say a word about the fact that Malcolm Little was a male prostitute, before he went to jail.</p>

		<p>Uh - what percentage of people in the U.S. are black?  It&rsquo;s in the teens somewhere as I recall.  So the percentage of movies about blacks should reflect that percentage, and NO MORE.  It&rsquo;s true that Spike Lee&rsquo;s films haven&rsquo;t made a profit for a long time, and that&rsquo;s because the percentage of people who want to see such films is a SMALL one - much smaller than the overall percentage of people, who want films that are not constantly harping on ghetto themes and that ARE about something they can identify with.</p>
