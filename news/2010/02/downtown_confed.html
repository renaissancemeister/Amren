<h1><a href="https://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/latest/lat_703168.shtml?v=2132">Downtown Confederate Monument Defaced With Anti-White Messages</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Augusta Chronicle, January 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The large Confederate monument on Broad Street was defaced with spraypainted anti-white messages.</p>
<p>The Richmond County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has responded, and witnesses at the scene in the 700 block of Broad told a Chronicle reporter they noticed someone spray painting the landmark at about 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Messages were marked in black and include the words black power, I hate whites and cracker killers as well as an obscenity against whites in large letters.</p>

<p>Laughably, I am in such a cynical mood tonight, I beg for an answer to this question: what is surprising here at all?</p>
<p>They want to exterminate us and take what we have built, plain and simple. Our &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; have spent over 65 years coming up with a code word (&ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;) to allow it. Most whites in the rank-and-file, are oblivious to this fact; and the ones who are not (a sizable minority of probably 18% to 25%) actively crave it as &ldquo;enrichment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is what &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; amounts to: </p>

		<p>We all know what the response would be I someone spray painted &#8220;I hate blacks&#8221; on a Martin Luther King statue.  It would be front page news and the $PLC would make a few million more dollars scaring up donations from it&rsquo;s frightened readers.<br>

		<p>This does not surprise me one bit! I guess apologists will say that &#8220;oppressed&#8221; blacks were simply lashing out at a symbol of slavery and segregation. I&rsquo;m not Southern, but I still disapprove of what those blacks wrote.</p>
<p>I agree with John PM. Non-whites absolutely despise us, and will not rest until we cease to exist. Until whites wake up and figure this out, there&rsquo;s little hope for our people.</p>

<p>The culprits will be found to be either liberal whites or rednecks causing trouble.  Blacks are too busy &#8220;kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221; to waste their time with spray paint anti white messages.  They would have used gang graffiti art instead.</p>

		<p> No doubt it will be decided that the monument is &#8220;offensive&#8221; and &#8220;intimidating&#8221; to blacks, and must be removed, to make way for a statue of Martin Luther King of similar size.</p>
<p> Then, wait and see what happens if somebody defaces THAT one! Talk about an instant federal case! Whereas, the anti-White slurs on the Confederate monument won&rsquo;t even merit a &#8220;ho-hum&#8221; or a footnote. It&rsquo;s the shape of the future, folks, unless we do something to change it, and soon.</p>

		<p>Since it&rsquo;s all but official nowadays that racism can be perpetrated only by whites and that &#8220;people of color&#8221; cannot be racist, this incident is not likely to spark any national outcry or candlelit ceremonies bemoaning hate. </p>

		<p>To Poster #20- you just hit on the tip of the iceberg. You can add to that list blacks are selfish and would never protect their own in the name of progress, as the whites have over the years. That ceased about 40 years ago, though. Whites have become the self-absorbed greedy, screw you before you screw me, cut-throat corporate yuppie wannabes in society today. I hate to say that of my people but there is no more loyalty in the white race. Shame on the race baiters and traitors amongst us. But sooner or later, our backs will be pushed against the wall and retaliation will be the only recourse. </p>

<p>That is why blacks and Whites and probably all races should isolate themselves from each other as far as practically possible. Medieval Europeans (or the people in present day Vietnam) did not have to face such a &#8216;black&rsquo; problem like what Whites in present day U.S.A, France, Britain or South Africa are facing.</p>

		<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t entirely blame them for hating us. A parent who always gives into a child&rsquo;s demands will gradually be resented by that child, the child can&rsquo;t respect a parent who does whatever he wants. Such a parent isn&rsquo;t worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t respect whites because we have no backbone, we support government programs that benefit people who hate us. Not only that we teach blacks and Mexicans to hate whites in public school using textbooks that promote the view that America was founded by evil racists and that White societies have always been cruel and oppressive towards non-Whites. Should we be surprised that non-whites hate us? It&rsquo;s amazing that any blacks or Mexicans don&rsquo;t hate us when faced with a massive propaganda machine (the mainstream media and hollywood) putting out anti-white material as well constantly.</p>
<p>I only hope that these kinds of anti white activites will awaken some whites to the hostility that so many minorities feel toward them. I get the feeling when I talk to a lot of liberal whites that they don&rsquo;t actually know a lot of Blacks or Mexicans very well, they don&rsquo;t seem to realize how much we are hated or how different our cultures really are. As Mr. Taylor has noted in the past, it is easy to admire diversity from afar. </p>
<p>I live in Southern California, the High School down the street from me painted a mural years ago on the side of one of their buildings depicting large Mestizo faces with menacing expressions on them. It was a kind of monument to their hostility toward whites. I wish they would paint more actually, maybe then more whites would start to get the message. We are being dispossesed of our country by hostile aliens. If it&rsquo;s ever going to get better I believe it will have to get a lot worse first.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Wait! It is true that peanut butter was invented by a black person.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, it is not:</p>
<p>&#8220;Peanuts, which are native to the New World tropics, were mashed into paste by Aztecs hundreds of years ago. Evidence of modern peanut butter comes from US patent #306727 issued to Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Montreal, Quebec in 1884, for a process of milling roasted peanuts between heated surfaces until the peanuts reached &#8220;a fluid or semi-fluid state.&#8221; As the product cooled, it set into what Edson described as &#8220;a consistency like that of butter, lard, or ointment.&#8221; In 1890, George A. Bayle Jr., owner of a food business in St. Louis, manufactured peanut butter and sold it out of barrels. J.H. Kellogg, of cereal fame, secured US patent #580787 in 1897 for his &#8220;Process of Preparing Nutmeal,&#8221; which produced a &#8220;pasty adhesive substance&#8221; that Kellogg called &#8220;nut-butter.&#8221;&#8220;</p>

		<p>The idea for peanut butter may have come from the nut butters used in some Asian and southern European cuisines. I am refering to sesame paste (tahini), poppy seed paste and almond paste. </p>

		<p>Well only 2% of whites owned slaves in America and per capita, free blacks owned more slaves. </p>
<p>Also blacks were the first to profit off the slave trade selling their own people into slavery. </p>
<p>Not only did blacks and whites own slaves, but so did chinese americans, native indians, and Mexicans. </p>
<p>Also lets not forget that the first slaves in America were white indentured servants. And that the Vikings had sold white slaves all over the world for little better than a head of cattle. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that Julius Cesar had 1,000,000 white slaves, sending some to die horrible deaths in the lead mines. </p>

		<p>Someone saw a person spray-painting the monument around 8:30PM? I know it was dark, but maybe we can get a description. I say try to catch them. This could be anything from a serious hate crime to a nut-job trying to spark helter-skelter to some kids pranking. Hopefully, the local media picked it up. That is one way to get tips.</p>

		<p>In 1994 in Salem, Oregon, a Mennoite gentlemen told us that in the future there would be racial wars brewing in the US. There were groups in Oregon at that stirring people up against non-white American or immigrants. Obviously it has been planned to happen this way and anyone being influenced to hate &#8220;blacks&#8221; because some group is doing this is exactly what the instigators wanted.  </p>
<p>Sounds like many of you already have hatred in your hearts  &mdash;  it didn¬¥t just happen because of this one incident.  The US is so fragmented and so disunited that it will continue to topple down in ruins.  Only when the multi-racially American soldiers are sent to war is the only time that there is some type of unity.  Many organized groups manning websites have been set up to stir venom among the people of the US.  Think about all of the non-White countries in the world at this moment, whose millions of people are displaced at this time in history.  If it is not war, it is some climatic disaster.  I saw some UN soldiers throwing white non-nutritious bread at some little African children whose families are displaced.  The were being treating worse then family pets. Seriously, are the Whites suffering the most at this time.  Check the statistics.  Racial strife is an abomination!!!!!!!!!</p>

		<p>I came across this article from one of the websites I check daily for news. Sadly,that site is the only place I&rsquo;ve seen this defacing of a Confederate monument mentioned.<br>
 Having said that I want to go on and say I find this act dispicable,no matter who did it. I also find it quite disgusting that so many commenting here appear to take it for granted that blacks are uneducated and hate white people. I am black and as my response here shows I do indeed know how to spell. Additionally, I do not hate white people nor any other group of people, for that matter. I also find Southern history(including that of the Confederacy) fascinating. But wait, world history is also of profound interest to me. That said, for those here who are prone to make glib assertions about other groups of people, we could all do with brushing up on our collective history. Blacks fought for the Confederacy(many pressed into doing so, while other&rsquo;s, from cities like New Orleans, did so willingly) Why? Because they also owned slaves. Enough though! Granted,black people do stupid and dispicalbe things, but it is not a group doing these things, but individuals. I often hear friends of mine say, &#8221; I don&rsquo;t owe anyone anything, because I never owned a slave&#8221;. Touche! The point is taken and well made. But that works the other way too. Not all black people defaced that monument, but the comments suggest all black people act like this. Sad!!</p>

		<p>White people comprise about 16% of the world&rsquo;s population.  Why does the the other 84% of the world&rsquo;s population live in poverty?  Is it because of the control of the small percentage of white people?!  Pleeeeeeeeeze!  Give me a break!!

I have a hard time believing white people are responsible for the world&rsquo;s poverty and stunted growth&hellip;&hellip;white people are smart and industrious&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.most of the world&rsquo;s population are below normal intelligence, lazy, combative, and are fine with accepting handouts.  If it weren&rsquo;t for white people, everyone would be living in shanty towns.  Why do you think so many people want to move to the West?!!  </p>

		<p>Why is race so important to white people. If you did not identify with being white or American or from the North or the South. Being from Irish descent or old English or whereever. If you do not identify with this then WHO WOULD YOU BE. Who are you deep down. What is your spiritual aborigional conscious understanding. You see this spray painting may not have been commited by Black people at all. It is very easy to manipulate your society because you have no spiritual understanding. PS Freemasonic Lucifer worship does not count. Now thats another bloody problem White Americans have.</p>

		<p>The United States is a racist nation. In fact, the sheeple of this nation are experts at slander, thievery, murder, and terrorism as well. No need to spray paint only one small iota of an expression of that when you have a society that is comprised of the obscenely wealthy and wage slaves and a government that rewards and encourages ineptitude and criminal behavior. As was pointed out, the spelling was corrupt so it must have been the Gray Panthers since the schools are so dumbed down that correct spelling is now part of history. While government criminals steal billions and give billions more to their buddies and corporate criminals, incite murder and mayhem all over this planet while polluting everything they come into contact with, it surprises me something so trivial as racist graffiti would even get a mention in mainstream media. But then again, if you can keep the sheeple at each others throats, maybe they won&rsquo;t notice what is going on all around them. <br>

		<p>Are you sure the black person wrote this on the monuments? Maybe it is a cunning ploy to start a race war. What would be the reason to start a race war? So as to divide this country into 5 or 6 banana republics that the gnomes in London and Europe can more easily control instead of a five hundred pound gorilla that exist today. It is no accident that the right evils put in a black Obama, not the puppet Democratic party of the right wing Republican party. Is it an accident they show black men with white women? To heal the multi-trillions of theft by the major robber barons (These Republican evils gave the robber barons a green light to loot, and rob the worlds economy) that put the world&rsquo;s economy on her death bed that she will never get off will take four hundred years, not 4 years.It is no accident that the TV shows black men with white woman. Why are the evils trying to start a race war? The gnomes want a world dictatorship. You can&rsquo;t have a world dictatorship unless both sides of the world are equally destitute. Amen!</p>

As someone who has walked this very street many times, I can tell you a thing or two about Broad Street in Augusta, GA.</p>
<p>1.) If you are white and find yourself walking around this street after dark, spray-paint will probably be the last of your worries&hellip;.</p>
<p>2.) Although Broad Street is THE main street in Downtown Augusta, and theoretically should be a thriving, attractive town center&hellip;THe opposite is actually true. Half of the store fronts are boarded up. It is a faltering area, despite years of trying to revitalize it. Can you guess the reason? It is within walking distance of several all-black neighborhoods, and the city of Augusta is at least half black, if not more. YOu can imagine the down town scene, crack-heads, panhandlers, street boogers, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>An &#8220;inner city&#8221; black would be more likely to use the slang spellings and words, like &#8220;crackuhs&#8221;, or &#8220;crackas&#8221;; and more likely to use &#8220;whitey&#8221; than whites.  And, as was said, &#8220;black power&#8221; is a very dated slogan.  Also, the &#8220;penmanship&#8221; has no &#8220;ghetto&#8221; flourish. finally, it&rsquo;s such a blatantly dishonorable and foolish thing for any race to wish to be identified with (yes, I know, I know  &mdash;  blacks are not known for their sense of honor and wisdom, but still&hellip;).</p>
<p>I think that there is another tribe behind this, some tribe which is reflexively trying to make use of all of the sentimental symbols of our nationhood, so that they can create the impression of &#8220;a nation under attack&#8221;, and direct us at the appropriate time to what they deem to be the appropriate target.</p>

Most of them wouldn&rsquo;t have lowered themselves to doing this and those who might be into such things would certainly have used more poetic language and much more artistic spray can technique.
