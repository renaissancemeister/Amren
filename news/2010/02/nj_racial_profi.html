			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Thompson, NBC New York, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 19-year-old Queens student, Rodney Tanzymore, was arrested Monday morning by New Jersey State Police for allegedly making a phony 911 call last November that resulted in a controversial traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
<p>At the time of the original incident, State Police were accused of racial profiling when they stopped a bus full of mostly black and Hispanic Queens students who were returning to New York from a visit to Howard University in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>They had stopped the bus on the Turnpike between exits 7 and 7A after getting a 911 just moments earlier when the bus had stopped at a rest stop and someone called in saying they saw thee of the people on the bus brandishing  weapons.</p>
<p>Troopers responded, pulling the bus over and getting everyone off the bus, putting them in handcuffs, and searching them and the bus in an  effort to find the gunmen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The intense investigation led State Police to this arrest of Tanzymore, one of the students on the bus. He is alleged to have made the call, apparently as a prank.</p>
<p>And a source tells us he is alleged to have done this before  &mdash;  in New York. Tanzymore was arrested by the NYPD last August for making a false 911 call.</p>

		<p>&#8220;State Police were accused of racial profiling when they stopped a bus full of mostly black and Hispanic Queens students who were returning to New York from a visit to Howard University in Washington, DC.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know blacks especially have all this &#8216;racial solidarity&rsquo; and their very existences seem to have turned into a strange lie of sorts, but I really wonder if this is a case of &#8216;tyranny of the minority&rsquo;. How many kids on that bus were really dismayed at seeing the police? And how many were relieved to see the police but were too frightened (even with police there) to show or admit this? </p>

		<p>I am surprised it took from last November to trace this call.  Doesn&rsquo;t the phone company have a record of all calls made for billing purposes?  This black should have been arrested two months or more ago.</p>

<p>YES! the instant the last number is dialed and  before the connection is made, the phone company and military monitoring has the location, who owns it and any other information on record and THEN! the connection is made. The nonsense of &#8220;keep him on the line&#8221; is just that, NONSENSE! and my experience is several years out of date!</p>

		<p>The authorities fully expect that all racial incidents are started by Whites. When it&rsquo;s not the case, they are embarrassed, and don&rsquo;t like to admit it. The non-White is NEVER prosecuted for the hoax.<br>

		<p>Original article says he will be charged with causing a false alarm.  Oh, that&rsquo;s nice.  This little coward knows full well what his actions could have done.  We ALL know what the intant was.  Just the suggestion of racial profiling can cause loss of job and place families in ruin.  This was not a junior high school kid pulling a fire alarm.  This was a coward trying to stick it to the man by jeopardizing somebody&rsquo;s livelihood.  This is an old case.  Had a person been fired, would this little creep be responsible for 4 months lost wages?  NOPE.  Maybe Barrack Hussein could invite them over for an apology session and a couple of beers?</p>

<p>Prosecuted? It&rsquo;s not like someone lied and said they were robbed or raped by someone who was black! (sarcasm). In which case the incident would be worthy of an award winning series designed to show us how this unpleasant (for the accused) &#8216;stereotype&rsquo; is simply not true. </p>
<p>Someone else pointed out once that these &#8216;hoaxes&rsquo; sometimes have behind them an intent to raise racial hatred against whites.</p>
<p>Then again, our entire society could be said to be a hoax of sorts. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;This little coward knows full well what his actions could have done. We ALL know what the intent was. Just the suggestion of racial profiling can cause loss of job and place families in ruin&#8221;.</p>
<p>How was he to know the city of NY, let alone whoever the police sent to investigate, would be accused of &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch. If there were profit in these kinds of things it would happen a lot more often. The government isn&rsquo;t quite as gullible, and weak, as an average citizen. </p>
