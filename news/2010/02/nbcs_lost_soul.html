<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A special NBC Black History Month lunch spread  &mdash;  featuring fried chicken, collard greens and black-eyed peas  &mdash;  sparked a commissary controversy yesterday, but the African-American chef who planned it doesn&rsquo;t understand the fuss.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I wanted to do was make a meal that everyone would enjoy  &mdash;  and that I eat myself,&#8221; NBC cook Leslie Calhoun told The Post last night.</p>
<p>Calhoun&rsquo;s proudly planned feast, which she began last year, hit a snag when Ahmir &#8220;Questlove&#8221; Thompson, the drummer for Jimmy Fallon&rsquo;s &#8220;Late Night&#8221; show band, The Roots, shot a photo of the menu outside the network&rsquo;s Rockefeller Center cafeteria and posted it on Twitter.</p>
<p>The menu quickly spread across the Internet and sparked a fury.</p>
<p>But Calhoun is confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Questlove, who I serve every day and who enjoys my food, requested the neck bone [cooked in] the black-eyed peas and fried chicken, then got off the line, saying, &#8216;This is racist,&rsquo;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next thing you know, people were taking pictures of the sign and asking all the other black people in the cafeteria if this was racist. They said that it wasn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Kevin Goldman, NBC&rsquo;s vice president of communications, tweeted: &#8220;The sign in the NBCU cafeteria has been removed. We apologize for anyone who was offended by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A disappointed Calhoun, who has worked at NBC for eight years, said she&rsquo;s been begging for years to make special entrees in honor of Black History Month, and got her wish last year. The plan was to have one special meal every Thursday during February  &mdash;  although she said she&rsquo;s nervous about next week.</p>

I happen to like fried chicken, collard greens, black eyed peas, and watermelon (which was rumored to be served at this event).

		<p>Is this for real? </p>
<p>I can remember eating chicken necks as a kid in a totally white Midwestern suburb in the 1950&rsquo;s. (My mother also served stuffed calves&rsquo; heart.)</p>
<p>I started eating collard greens and black-eyed peas when I married a southern woman. And, of course, I love fried chicken (which my wife no longer serves as she is trying to maintain her youthful figure).</p>
<p>The best bar-b-cue I ever had was in a black restaurant in Kansas City (it was goat).</p>
<p>Why denigrate the things that blacks do well?<br>

		<p>So serving corned beef and cabbage on St. Patty&rsquo;s day is totally acceptable, but a black woman cooking black food during black history month is not?  There is no logic here.</p>

		<p>Wow, one thing that blacks do extremely well is cook!  My favorite barbeque is Gate&rsquo;s in KC - black-owned and run, it is just fantastic.  Pork ribs - incredible!!  The only black specialty I won&rsquo;t eat is chit&rsquo;lins - I tried them and didn&rsquo;t like them.  But oh, my - collard greens and fried chicken??  I&rsquo;d drive a long way to get a meal like that!  And the way our local black chef makes mac&rsquo;n&rsquo;cheese is to die for.  I say give blacks their due when they do something well - and they&rsquo;ve got some of the best cooks around!  </p>

		<p>At the risk of starting a new round of The Barbecue Wars, I have noticed that blacks seem to have the magic touch when it comes to any kind of BBQ, whether it&rsquo;s Kansas City style beef brisket, such as Gates or Arthur Bryant&rsquo;s, the brain-dead St. Louis style of grilling a pork steak and dumping it in pan full of warmed over BBQ sauce, or what is undoubtedly Real BBQ, the way they do it in Memphis   &mdash;   very slow smoked shredded pork shoulder in between cole slaw and bun, and a very light thin tomato based sauce as an option.  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the nice thing about being White, I can eat all the fried chicken, collard greens and black-eyed peas I want and nobody could care less. In  fact I can eat any ethnic food and nobody cares. </p>

		<p>I LOVE &#8220;soul food&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s good, healthy, nourishing food. And tasty too.  So what&rsquo;s wrong with serving it on Black History Month?   Hey, I&rsquo;ll take one of those tickets!   Yum!</p>
<p>It just shows you can&rsquo;t do anything right to please them; some hyper-touchy person will always complain about &#8220;racism&#8221;, one way or another.  In reality, the fact is that racism exists in the mind of the beholder.  A race-obsessed mind will always see racism everywhere.</p>
<p>Someone please pass me some of that fried chicken!</p>

		<p>It sounds like someone doesn&rsquo;t want us making any generalizations about racial groups at all for fear that we will identify trends that lead us to segregate.</p>
<p>In another vein, getting bent out of shape over a food preference stereotype seems to be the height of absurdity.</p>
<p>It gets more absurd when you think for a second and realize that most of the buffets in the south include some combination of the above foods either all the time or in regular rotation.</p>

		<p>I agree with the other posters. This particular Black diet tastes good and, largely, is good for you.  I, too, eat black-eyed peas, collard and mustard greens, and tomatoes.  Rather than fried chicken, however, I prefer salmon croquettes.  This is a balanced and healthy meal. One of the things that has actually damaged Blacks is moving AWAY from this type food and, instead, eating all that ghetto food served at McDonalds and the like.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve blimped up so badly and overrun diabetes and kidney dialysis centers.</p>

<p>If you like Black southern food, you should check out Ebony Magazine. They have some of the best recipies I have ever tried. In fact, they have a book entitled The Ebony Cookbook. I purchased it two years ago. The recipies are the best you will find in any magazine. The food is mouth watering.</p>

		<p>There is a Black soul food restaurant in Chicago called Edna&rsquo;s. The food is great, but their biscuits and beef and dumplings are to die for!!!! I could eat them all day!</p>
<p>My brother told me that their is another Black owned restaurant in Savannah, Georgia called Ms.Wix&rsquo;s. Apparently, people of all races stand in line more than an hour and a half just to get in for lunch. He told me food is nothing short of heaven and the biscuits there are probably better than Edna&rsquo;s. I am not sure about that, but the fact is the food is first-rate.</p>
<p>Like some of you posters have stated Black folks know how to cook!!!</p>

		<p>I am Black. I am glad I came across this post. There was nothing racist about her cooking soul food. The Today Show has cooking segments all the time. Different people from different ethnic groups are always cooking their native foods. I am not offended and I don&rsquo;t think any sensible person would be.</p>
<p>My late grandmother Mazie was one of the best cooks I have ever seen. She made pineapple cakes that were heavenly, yeast rolls to die for and sweet potato pie that would make you jump up and slap your own mama! In fact, all the women in my family can jam with some pots and pans! </p>
<p>Ms.Calhoun. I will eat your food baby!!! </p>

Give blacks this much, and it isn&rsquo;t much  &mdash;  They do have good tastes in food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the dishes described above as well as others are really old European dishes that became popular with blacks because they were most affordable.  When I lived in Slovenia, I found that the Slovenes, like the Austraians and Southern Germans, love wilted dandelion salads.  This is such an old favorite in Slovenia that dandelions are allowed to grow in all lawns and even the pulbic parks are not mowed until all the dandelion greens have been harvested.  But here, blacks list it as an &#8220;African American&#8221; dish.  This is due to the fact that dandelions were free to pick and blacks used to pick them in the South in public places, even on courthouse lawns during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>As far as taste goes, most of this type food, like fatback and barbecue pork, chitluns, etc., are very unhealthy fare, and better tasting food that is more healthy is available for any willing to think a little beyond their (dare I say it) nose.<br>

		<p>Has anyone besides me seen the Kenyan (as in real Africa) version of a KFC commercial where the adults are using the kid&rsquo;s head to wipe their fingers on, until the kid comes up with a bucket of KFC at which point the adults, as usual, started to wipe their hands on his head again, thought about it, then licked their fingers clean as the boy smiled&hellip;.You&rsquo;ll NEVER see that in the PC west.

		<p>White liberals - i.e. virtually the entire television industry - are the only ones &#8220;offended&#8221; by &#8220;stereotypical&#8221; black eats.  Blacks are not offended.  What IS offensive is that some whites at NBC can tell the black cook that her menu is offensive.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think &#8216;Soul Food&rsquo; is SLOP.  Growing up around it is probably why we&rsquo;re vegetarians, and refuse to even go into places that specialize in &#8216;Soul&rsquo;, &#8216;Southern&rsquo;, or &#8216;Home-style&rsquo; cooking.    So if I were black, I&rsquo;d be insulted to have Soul Food associated with my ethnic group.  It&rsquo;s nasty.</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s puzzling to see this bizarre reaction (although the article didn&rsquo;t make much sense).  I thought it was only racist when White People did things.  Is this the beginning of a positive trend?  Acknowledging that blacks can do racist things, too?</p>
<p>In any event, I grew up around blacks, have very close black friends today, and so know from experience that they (except for the Creoles who come to our house when Hurricanes are headed for Louisiana) are very BAD cooks.  My relatives who had black cooks had serious health problems, and my cousins who grew up eating what the maid cooked have ALL had multiple bypass surgeries, at far lower ages than one would expect.  And &#8216;Soul Food&rsquo; is the worst of the worst. YECH!</p>

<p>I am white, and like Calhoun confused and dismayed by the communications of Kevin Goldman, NBC&rsquo;s vice president of communications.  Goldman demonstrated poor judgement and cowardness.  Leslie Calhoun&rsquo;s memu was appropriate for Black History month as well as for anybody at any time.  The posted menu is delicious and nutritious.  Why would any reasonable person consider it racists?  Beyond me!</p>
<p>In my mind the real racist is Goldman as he saw racism in a menu that was honest and presented with good intentions.  May we, some day, get beyond this vain sillness.</p>
<p>I wish the best to Leslie Calhoun<br>

		<p>Michael Jordan is his own movie said that his favorite food was fried chicken and collard greens. Heard it myself.</p>
<p>Black folks have heavily influenced American cooking, and for the best. Their cooks make good stuff. I like fried chicken, black eyed peas, corn bread, etc. NOT so much collard greens, but that is a minor thing.</p>
<p>Dance, music, sports, cooking, etc. The American black has had a very big influence on American culture. This is NOT racist. They are to be complimented for the positive accomplishments.</p>

		<p>I agree with the majority of posters here: black people do make very good food.  I personally like the bean pie and stuff like that.  I find it very,very ironic that the PC machine is so hyper-sensitive that when a black woman wants to make typical black food for a national audience to see, the liberals and race-baiters have a heart attack.</p>
<p>My friends, this is showing us the way to divide and conquer.  Turn them on each other to expose their hypocrisy.  I am sure some very gifted white people will find a way to make this work, after all, that is how they brought all of us (white society in general) to our knees.</p>

But here, blacks list it as an &ldquo;African American&rdquo; dish. This is due to the fact that dandelions were free to pick and blacks used to pick them in the South in public places, even on courthouse lawns during the Great Depression.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;   Whiteplight</p>
<p>That is true, although I never saw blacks doing it.   When I was a child, in the 1940s, I can  remember very elderly Europeans (in this case, Italians, I believe), stooped over,  with sacks, who would be collecting the dandelion greens.  By the 1950&rsquo;s, with advancing prosperity and probably the demise of these very old people,  this was no longer seen.  (They made dandelion wine also, from the flowers.)</p>

		<p>#27 is correct in that most of this kind of hoopla is driven by guilt-ridden white liberals.  Many of them are urban, ivory-tower Northerners who think there&rsquo;s something demeaning about Southern soul or hillbilly food.  They want blacks to be no more than darker-skinned people no different than they are.  <br>
There was an earlier controversy about an MLK-Day soul-food menu in a school.  This time, since a black woman formulated the choices, you would think no one would complain.  But, of course, since a BLACK man yelped, the bleeding hearts had to take his side.  </p>

<p>You are too late in your prophecy. It already has. Go to any soul food restaurant in any major American city and you will see large numbers of White yuppies (and Black ones too for that matter) eating at these restaurants. Hell, even Bill O&rsquo;Reilly has talked about his experience at Sylvia&rsquo;s soul food restaurant in Harlem.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that collards won&rsquo;t stink if you put an unshelled pecan in the pot as they simmer.  This is Southern food for black and white and tastes best if cooked in a cast iron skillet.  When we were young, our father would often care for and feed us on Saturdays while my mother ran errands.  It seemed that for every weekend of my youth I got dried butterbeans, cornbread and a whipping.  </p>

		<p>Two points I take away from the article:</p>
<p>1) you can NEVER satisfy people who want to be offended; for the most part, blacks WANT to be offended, and they will never change; and<br>
2) there is no shortage of STUPID white enablers who foster this immature behavior. </p>

		<p>I must confess people, i happen to like soul food as well.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, before i &#8220;woke up&#8221; and became more racially aware, i was close friends with an Italian guy, with whom i had grown up with, who was, and still is, married to a black woman, who herself had grown up in the south.</p>
<p>Quite a few times, when i would visit them and hang out, the black wife would cook and serve me and there family, her home cooked meals. And for me, the food was so tasty and delicious.</p>
<p>But i no longer associate with them (have&rsquo;nt for years,) so my soul food eating days are over. </p>

&#8220;Please forgive my ignorance of Black culture, but what exactly is &ldquo;soul food&rdquo;? And why are they making such a big deal about this? I honestly don&rsquo;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soul food is traditional old-fashioned southern cooking-collard greens cooked in bacon, fried chicken or catfish, steak smothered in gravy, hush puppies, black eyed peas, mac and cheese, watermelon, chitlins, ribs, sweet potato or pecan pie etc.etc. served in large portions. This type of food is popular in the South and is often cooked and eaten by Blacks but is also made and eaten and popular by Whites. It&rsquo;s supposed bo be the kind of food made by old Southern grandmothers that comes from the &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;heart&#8221; and is comfort food that is good for the &#8220;soul&#8221;. Large portions, comforting and non-pretentious. Even though southern Whites like soul food, it is often associated more with Blacks and some Blacks are leftist Whites claim using the food to associate with Blacks is stereotypical and hence racist.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what y&rsquo;all are talking about with the greens &#8220;stinking&#8221; or &#8220;Simmering/Boiling&#8221; them.<br>
As a Chef in New Orleans I learned to cook Greens thusly:</p>
<p>- Sweat down some small diced fat-back (unsliced slab of bacon).<br>
- Add diced onions, garlic and tomatoes and saute in the bacon grease.<br>
- Add the greens.Stir.<br>
- Add a little vinegar, a little sugar and a lot of salt.<br>
- Turn down to low heat and cover stirring occasionaly until the greens are tender.</p>
<p>No Stink, unless you think bacon, onions and garlic stink!</p>
<p>I would not say real soul food is &#8220;Healthy&#8221; what with the liberal use of bacon grease and lots of sugar and salt, but it is Damn good when done right.<br>
And NO, &#8220;soul food&#8221; is NOT a black thing, it was and still is a Southern Thing!</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>This is true.   These are simply Southern foods.   Not &#8220;black&#8221; nor African.  I hesitated to get into this, fearing to sound pedantic, but since several posters have brought it up, let me point out that these foods do NOT have roots in Africa and were unknown blacks living there. These plants are not indigenous to Africa. They were carried here from Europe and their preparation was taught to African household servants.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Predominantly a fall and winter vegetable, collard is often the only green planting to be found in the yard or garden of a rural home during these cool seasons. [Cabbage] is a cool-weather crop that can tolerate frost but not heat.&#8221;  Botanically, collards are a form of cabbage, members of the colewort family, which grows across Europe and Asia. The word &#8220;collard&#8221; is a slurred version of &#8220;cole-wort&#8221;, an Anglo-Saxon word. [Literally, a &#8220;cabbage-plant&#8221; &hellip; cole (cabbage), as in &#8216;cole&rsquo; slaw.]   Collard is a smooth-leaved form of Kale (kaal in Norwegian, kohl in German, col in Spanish) &hellip; a variety of non-heading cabbage which is close to the original wild plant. It is thought to have been brought to Britain and France by the Celts. As a result of  <i><b>thousands of years of selective breeding, </b></i>, it has been developed into various forms (broccoli, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, bok choy, etc.).  (Kohlrabi, meaning  &#8216;cabbage-turnip&rsquo;   was developed in 1554 by a German botanist. Germans favored colewort plants with fat stems; these became kohlrabi;  Belgians selected plants with tightly packed leafy buds, and these became brussels sprouts.)   A  famous national dish of Portugal is Caldo Verde, a rich soup made of  shredded collards. Highly nutritious, the cole  family is rich in anti-oxidents for fighting cancer, also a good source of Vitamin C, potassium, and calcium,  while having the fewest calories and least fat of any vegetable. These cole plants were staples <b>eaten all over Europe and Asia </b>before being brought to America.  Cool weather plants, they were  unknown to Africans.  (And chickens, btw, originated in India.)     </p>
<p>Indeed, many of the basic staples in the African diet today:  peanuts, corn, peppers, plantains, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, etc.  were <b>brought to Africa by Europeans. </b> Peanuts, for instance (a basic Afrian food today), were brought from Brazil by Portuguese slave ships.  So the slave trade brought Africa benefits in some ways.  Very few  foods today considered &#8220;African&#8221; are actually of African origin   &mdash;    although there are a great many potentially valuable food plants which are native to Africa but remain still wild because, unlike Europeans and Asians, Africans did not cultivate and domesticate them into modern, edible  forms suited for agriculture. </p>
<p> <i>&#8220;collard: [n] - variety of kale having smooth leaves.   Kale, in turn, is  variety of cabbage in which the central leaves do not form a head, being nearly the original or wild form of the species.  It is closer to wild cabbage than most domesticated forms. The species `Brassica&rsquo; contains a wide array of vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Sorghum, okra, and yams ARE of African origin. Although okra first grew wild on the banks of the Nile, then was cultivated in Arabia and throughout the Mediterranean. It arrived (like peanuts) in West Africa via Portuguese ships from Brazil.<br>

<p>That is probably because a large migration of southern blacks took place to the north and to other parts of the country, so that style of cooking became associated in the national mind with them&hellip;. whereas in the South, it was just normal cooking for everyone. </p>

		<p>If I am not mistaken, the term &#8220;living high on the hog&#8221; means that one can afford to buy the better cuts of meat.  A lot of the traditional meats of Black &#8220;Soul Food&#8221; were what the wealthier Southern Whites were not interested in eating, like pigs feet, chicken gizzards, chicken necks and ox tails.  </p>
<p>In the 1800s when Blacks were poor slaves or sharecroppers they could only get the least expensive cuts of meat.  After the Civil War, when the South was burned to the ground and many Southern Whites were destitute, the newly poor Whites started to eat foods more similar to the Blacks.  </p>
<p>The tradition of eating black eyed peas on New Year&rsquo;s Day (for good luck) dates back to the Civil War.  The Union soldiers burned almost all of the Southern crops but sometimes left the black eyed peas, because they considered it a food only grown to feed farm animals.  Hence it allowed the Southerners to survive.</p>
