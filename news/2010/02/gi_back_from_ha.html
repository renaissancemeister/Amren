<h1>GI Back From Haiti Stricken With Rare Infection</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bryan Garner, WPTV (West Palm Beach), February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Army Warrant Officer Chris Lust of Stuart is recovering from a rare bacterial infection which he contracted while helping with the earthquake relief efforts in Haiti.</p>
<p>Lust says he was helping distribute food to earthquake victims in Port-au-Prince when he became ill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At first he was told he suffered from dengue fever, or possibly malaria.  But when he arrived at the VA hospital in Tampa, doctors changed the diagnosis to leptospirosis, he said.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Army, four soldiers became ill and had to be evacuated for treatment while serving in Haiti. A spokesman would not elaborate on the type of illness those soldiers contracted, or if any of them are sick with leptospirosis, like Lust.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization leptospirosis is a rare and severe bacterial infection that is endemic in Haiti.  The WHO reports infection in humans may occur when the bacteria come into contact with the skin, typically through contact with unclean water that has been infected by animals.</p>

<p>Yep  &mdash;  usually animal urine is the contaminant. Can also be transmitted by blood (abattoir workers get it) and by semen&hellip;<br>

<p>Yes, so let&rsquo;s bring as many hatian earthquake &#8216;victims&rsquo; here as possible, as soon as possible, to spread the &#8216;joy&rsquo; of leptospirosis so we here can experience its effects.</p>
<p>The government has lifted the AIDS ban so why not import leptospirosis as well?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The United Nations estimates 6% of Haitians are infected with HIV/AIDS. The highest rate in the Western Hemisphere. ..One in twenty Haitians is infected with HIV/AIDS and there are over 150,000 AIDS orphans.</p>
<p>Leptospirosis won&rsquo;t be rare for long, it&rsquo;ll be as common as HIV/AIDS among the new haitian refugees.</p>

		<p>  It seems like most new infections originate in the Third World; Africa being the usual point of origin. With little effort put into quarantining travelers/immigrants these days, we can only expect a growing crescendo of exotic diseases to become established in America.</p>

		<p>Haiti was where AIDS came from for America since half the population is infected. <br>
Where did they get AIDS? <br>
Africa,where else.</p>

		<p>Leptospirosis is not exotic, it is common in parts of the US. All puppies in the US used to be routinely vaccinated for it (the standard canine vaccination protocol used to be the combo shot DHLPP   &mdash;   distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo and parainfluenza) but the lepto vaccine is considered risky now and only given if the animal lives in an area prone to infection (plus it only lasts a few months).</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>And one could add that most, if not all, Haitians are infected with intestinal parasites.  Worms, in plain language!  Another delightful enrichment for us.  </p>

		<p>Seems pretty straightforwardly simple to me.  Haiti = country populated by people of inferior intelligence; health care for natives of Haiti = substandard; government in Haiti = corrupt black politicians who could care less about the fate of their own people; it all adds up to GO THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  And it will remain like that until the Haitians get their act together and clean up their own internal messes.  Outsiders can help sweep up the piles from the quake, yes   &mdash;   but the REAL problems must be solved by the Haitians themselves.</p>
