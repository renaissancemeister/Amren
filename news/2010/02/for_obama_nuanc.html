<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/us/politics/09race.html?hp">For Obama, Nuance on Race Invites Questions</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, members of the Congressional Black Caucus have expressed irritation that Mr. Obama has not created programs tailored specifically to African-Americans, who are suffering disproportionately in the recession. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some black scholars say Mr. Obama has failed to lead on the race issue. {snip} After analyzing the State of the Union address, the institute&rsquo;s [.The Kirwan Institute, which studies race and ethnicity] scholars warned that &#8220;continued failure to engage race would be devastating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Eric Dyson, a Georgetown University sociologist and longtime supporter of Mr. Obama, is exasperated. &#8220;All these teachable moments,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the professor refuses to come to the class.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Elinor Tatum, the editor and publisher of the black-owned Amsterdam News, says that if blacks were asked &#8220;Is he doing a good job for African-Americans?&#8221; his numbers would be lower.</p>

<p>How about asking the editor of a <i>White</i>-owned newspaper if Obongo is doing a good job for European-Americans?</p>
<p>Blacks are permitted   &mdash;   nay, <i>encouraged</i>   &mdash;   to flaunt their own racial special interests, while Whites are forbidden to so much as suggest that they <i>have</i> White racial interests.  This is the Left&rsquo;s idea of a White Racist Nation that keeps blacks down.</p>

		<p>These black professionals are embarrased to be black, because blacks are dismal failures.  That&rsquo;s why they push by hook or crook anything or any program that will elevate blacks to positions, knowing full well they don&rsquo;t deserve them.  They pretend that blacks are equal to whites by claiming the huge disparity between blacks and whites is because of slavery 150 years ago, or opporession, or racism.  </p>
<p>They feel they aren&rsquo;t taken seriously by the rest of the world, because so many blacks fail. </p>
<p>These self-appointed black elites are so arrogant and blind to their own stupidity they fail to see that their own successes are the result of AA and not their own abilities, with the possible exception of maybe 1% or less.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing something for blacks,&#8221; translates to giving the brother something for nothing, then FORCING everyone to pretend he got there on his own.  I mean, after all, it worked for them.</p>

		<p>Of course he&rsquo;s not doing enough for them, because he had a white mother. She put racism into him at conception, and he can&rsquo;t fully see the need to &#8220;do more&#8221; for blacks because his white blood blinds him to his duty to the black race.</p>
<p>He just needs to listen to the call of Afrique in his father&rsquo;s blood, and use that voice to hold his white blood accountable for his resistance to doing the right thing and giving the black elites ever greater privileges that the demand.</p>

Yes, and we want more of it. The more that our white youth see of the racial double standard, the more they will drift our way, if not actively seek us out from frustration and seeking a community. </p>
<p>Some of them still have the instinct of self interest, and we can cultivate and develop them for racial  survival.  Teach them how to identify the liberal elite whites who encourage blacks to think like blacks. Teach them how to hold these whites accountable for not living in black neighborhoods and for not sending their kids to black public schools. </p>
<p>Teach them to read, study, discuss, and implement the Maureen Dowd treatment.</p>

<p>Excellent.  This one makes me think if the Pharoahs had to deal with this.  History is written by the winners, but what if the historians of yore were P.C. for their time&hellip;  It is totally possible that what we know, isn&rsquo;t what we really know.</p>

		<p>&hellip;.african americans are suffering disproportionately in this recession&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks have had decades of Affirmative Action placing them in equally lucrative positions as Whites.  If they are suffering, there is no-one to blame but themselves.  I&rsquo;m currently out-of-the-workforce, and I&rsquo;m suffering as much as any black individual. What will the President do for me?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just a game. Obummer is pretending not to care for his down-trodden fellow Americans (blacks) so he doesn&rsquo;t put off the majority of the whites who voted for him so he can secure a second term. Once he has a second term, he will have nothing to lose and the hand outs will increase, maybe even reparations. A second term for this imposture will be the death blow to middle class White America.</p>
<p>As John PM always says&hellip;.&rdquo;God help us all.&rdquo;<br>
