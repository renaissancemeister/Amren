<h1>Use of Twitter, Facebook Rising Among Gang Members</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Watkins, Washington Post, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials say gangs are making greater use of Twitter and Facebook, where they sometimes post information that helps agents identify gang associates and learn more about their organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You find out about people you never would have known about before,&#8221; said Dean Johnston with the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, which helps police investigate gangs. &#8220;You build this little tree of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tech-savvy gangsters have long been at home in chatrooms and on Web sites like MySpace, but they appear to be gravitating toward Twitter and Facebook, where they can make threats, boast about crimes, share intelligence on rivals and network with people across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing a lot more of it,&#8221; Johnston said. &#8220;They will even go out and brag about doing shootings.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another California case involving a different gang, much of the information gathered by investigators came from members&rsquo; Facebook accounts. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And gang members sometimes turn the tables, asking contacts across their extended networks for help identifying undercover police officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tapping into tweets and status updates can be easy. Agents pose as pretty girls and send flirtatious friend requests. Confidential informants sometimes let police peer into their accounts.</p>
<p>Authorities can also seek help from the Web sites. Representatives from Twitter and Facebook say they regularly cooperate with police and supply information on account holders when presented with a search warrant. Neither company would discuss specifics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Crips, Bloods, Florencia 13, MS-13 and other gangs have long used MySpace to display potentially incriminating photos and videos of people holding guns and making hand gestures. They also post messages about rivals.</p>
<p>Last week, officials in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, announced the arrest of 50 people in a crackdown of a Latino gang they say was engaged in drug sales and hate crimes against black residents. Prosecutors say some of the evidence was pulled from MySpace and YouTube, including rap videos taunting police with violent messages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anguiano tracks the online activity of graffiti vandals  &mdash;  the so-called tagging crews that sometimes morph into gangs. They post tweets saying they are heading out to spray paint and sometimes post links to photographs of their work.</p>
<p>Often, they cannot resist bragging about their handiwork, and the electronic trail they leave is frequently used as evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They talk about it too much,&#8221; Anguiano said. &#8220;You want the fame so you&rsquo;ve got to go out there and talk about it. That&rsquo;s when your mouth gets you in trouble.&#8221;<br>

		<p>On the other hand, it solves the problem of Twitter and Facebook not having enough diversity, as a few stories here on AR a few months ago said that some were complaining about.</p>

		<p>Wonderful! This is about a step below Darwin-Award winning! The last thing we need, however, is articles like this potentially warning these losers that law enforcement is on to them (assuming they read much, aside from their online communications). I wonder, how much access do their rivals have to their online posts?</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re too stupid to have that much insight.  And, they think they&rsquo;re smarter than the cops  &mdash;  especially White cops.  After all, on TV they see nothing but bumbling, foolish, helpless White males in need of counsel and salvation from much smarter and wiser non-Whites.</p>
<p>At the gang detail presentation I attended a while back, a White detective told us that black and hispanic gang members are so stupid that they announce their whereabouts and criminal activities in graffiti all over the walls for the cops to see, and then &#8216;sign it&rsquo; with their gang name   &mdash;  and that they&rsquo;ve done this for years and years with little understanding as to how the cops nailed them.</p>
<p>Asian gangs, he said, are on a whole different level:  secretive, crafty, deeply hidden, violent, terrorizing entire communities into silence, difficult to track and capture, even more difficult to prosecute.  But Asians are, in general, two standard deviations above blacks and hispanics in intelligence, and that alone accounts for their different MOs.</p>

 </p>
<p>About 95% of the people on MySpace   &mdash;   of EVERY race   &mdash;   are shown making those ridiculous gang hand gestures. It&rsquo;s an absolute epidemic   &mdash;   although I suspect most of the white kids don&rsquo;t even know what their hand signs mean, they&rsquo;re just copying what they see on MTV etc.  </p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m very glad to hear that white people are using their brains and catching nonwhite criminals who obviously aren&rsquo;t using theirs. Anybody dumb enough to boast on social network sites about their illegal activities deserves to have the book thrown at them. </p>

<p>  Heck, I thought crime was way down in Los Angeles because of Hispanic immigration? You could have fooled me. Gang crime was awful to begin with, so crime went from very bad to just bad.</p>

		<p>About a year ago, in Houston, a mexican gang posted a video of thirty of them stomping a white boy to death and stomping into a new ruined life the white girl who tried to help him.  But someone quickly took the video down and the news did not even mention the story.</p>

		<p>Ah-they breed Twits in NZ too.<br>
Late one night,a couple of youths broke into a building site in Railway road,Wellington,NZ.They investigated the site manager&rsquo;s office,and found a fax machine and an expensive angle grinder.They also found a digital camera.This was irresistible,and they took photos of themselves striking various poses wearing the manager&rsquo;s hard hat and yellow jacket.They then decamped with the fax machine,the grinder and also the hard hat,but(Duh!) left the camera behind.<br>
Later that day they were picked up by the local police.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, I read about a guy in New York who, had become the first person to commit murder because of he was insulted on Twitter.  &#8220;What sort of person would do that, I thought.&#8221;  Then I saw his name, and thought, &#8220;of course, it had to be!&#8221;</p>
