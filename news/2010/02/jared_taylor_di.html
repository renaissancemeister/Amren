		<p>Very well argued, Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>I think, also, another reason you aren&rsquo;t allowed on TV here in America is that you aren&rsquo;t a punching bag. If you weren&rsquo;t as articulate as you are, and if you weren&rsquo;t able to defend yourself as adroitly as you did on Russian TV, they would let you on CNN or FOX News, I think, so they could make an example out of you. </p>
<p>CNN, Fox and all the rest are true believers in diversity. They won&rsquo;t allow anyone on who can argue against them persuasively. They know they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make a fool out of you, and that, in fact, you would likely make a fool out of them. They can&rsquo;t have that, so they aren&rsquo;t letting you on.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Russia. This material surprised me by the title. Why would anybody call it Russian TV! </p>
<p>I have had my own survey with a great deal of people in the USA and Russia. This station is unknown in Russia and it would be stupid to broadcast it in Russia where so few people understand English. </p>
<p>Nobody in my USA community has ever known about the station. What a minority of community watch is a Russian language broadcast whose prime and main interest is Russian entertainment and Russian news.</p>
<p>Do not know what to think. </p>

		<p>Well articulated.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor made a pretty good impression&hellip;..and presentation.</p>
<p>The media refuses to cover anything honestly about Amren, because they&rsquo;re afraid it would bring many whites actively over to our side&hellip;..and they&rsquo;re right.  It would.</p>
<p>Contrast what WNs stand for with the Black Panthers threatening whites at polling places, telling them they are there to make sure a black man gets elected, and take note of the fact that the Panthers were barely covered by the mainfringe media.  Imagine if Amren did the same as the Panthers.</p>

		<p>There are open white nationalists in Russia&rsquo;s parliament.  Russia still has a lot of racial consciousness.  Russia&rsquo;s leaders have cracked down on illegal immigration and are trying to increase the Russian birthrate.  They care about their own people&rsquo;s survival, whatever faults they may have.  That&rsquo;s why the neocons are so fixated on attacking Russia.  They can&rsquo;t stand the idea that a nation of white Christian people is actually trying to survive instead of committing suicide like America is.  Neocons and their allies on the left, like George Soros, are continually scheming to make Russia a &#8220;democratic and tolerant&#8221;(ie controlled by non-Russians and self-hating) country.  </p>

		<p>Hi Jared<br>
This is Christianto Wibisono, Indonesian journalist who had covered Am Ren conference since 2000. It is very surprise to see you appear on Russia Today and was boycotted by American Media.<br>
So USA has been a new Gulag Regime and Russia is the new human<br>
rights mecca for people who doesn&rsquo;t want to be part of the PC<br>
regime which doesn&rsquo;t respect diversity and meritocracy. I think <br>
the US will go down the Soviet Union path. This is the most<br>
modern karma in reverse this time in a real political meaning.</p>

AR should be producing their own video with their own content.</p>
<p>Someone noted on another post that AR is essentially allowing the MSM to dictate the topics and forums for discussions on race.</p>
<p>AR can by-pass the MSM by producing their own podcasts with their own topics and guest.</p>
<p>A once a week hour or even 1/2 hour program would be a great start. We can email and tweet questions for the guest beforehand or during the interview.</p>
<p>AR is losing out by not taking advantage of the power of video on the web.</p>

		<p>The fact that Jared Taylor can openly discuss his views on Russia Today and not on any major media outlet in the United States demonstrates how far to the left the USA has gone.  </p>
<p>It is more than curious the nation the neoconservatives despise the most is Russia.  The Wall Street Journal has also displayed extreme hostility towards Russia, much more than it ever had against China.</p>

		<p>I agree with Sbuffalonative,</p>
<p>Jared you should consider cable TV. </p>
<p>I mentioned this in a previous post. A half-hour show on cable tv late at night would work.  Cable tv is relatively cheap late at night and people tend to channel surf so they will find you.  Jared you would be a great spokesman because you are not extreme, yet you are candid in your views.  That would be something you don&rsquo;t see on TV.</p>
<p>As for advertisers, they will come.  Not at first, but if you get viewers, the demographics will be irresistible to some advertisers. </p>
<p>The main stream media will pooh-pooh your show, but that will only be a blessing as it will get you exposure and cause more people to tune in.   Sell stock to raise the money.  That in itself will be a huge news story.   </p>
<p>There is already the Black Entertainment Channel, the Filipino Channel, the LatinNation channel and on and on.  The hypocrisy would be glaring for advertisers to advertise on those channels but not on CTV (Caucasian TV).  </p>
<p>That is where you should channel your skills and energy.  Because debating with Tim Wise or fighting with Jeffry Imm and his ilk are interesting but in reality a waste of your talents.</p>

       Even the media and movie industry in Russia is surprisingly un-PC. There are hardly any non-Whites in Russian movies and the all the actors in them look more like the Northern Euro type of people found through out &#8220;white bread, small-town&#8221; America then the people acting in Hollywood. Indeed their movie industry is what you would expect any normal White country would have.<br>

<p>Alex,<br>
Russia Today is primarily directed at the non-Russian world to give them an unbiased portrait of Russia. That would explain why many Russians do not know about it. RT is received and viewed in many countries from Great Britain to Indonesia. Go to Wikipedia and check it out. The channel has won many professional awards.<br>

		<p>Let me add my voice of support for Post #6.  Any kind of regular WebTV-cast would provide an opportunity to publicize issues or sides to them that don&rsquo;t correspond the MSM&rsquo;s diversity agenda.  Web distribution of news has played in role in organizing the tea parties and the resignation of Van Jones.  We should not let the MSM be The Great Firewall of America.</p>
<p>BTW, if the photos I see from conferences are indicative of the leadership, you many need to recruit a younger talent base to increase your tech-savvy.<br>

A good format AR may like to consider in producing their own internet broadcasts and video is bloggingheads.tv:</p>
<p><a href="https://bloggingheads.tv/" rel="nofollow">https://bloggingheads.tv/</a></p>
<p>The format is simple. A split screen where two people discuss ideas.</p>
<p>These interviews could be posted on the AR webpage (of course) but there are other websites like youtube where they could be posted as well.</p>
<p>All you need is for each participant to have computer (pc or laptop), webcam, and microphone.</p>
<p>Easy, simple, direct. No mainstream media filters or censors.</p>

He so calmly and delicately and rationally explains our point of view, simply a token presence on Youtube would increase our numbers substantially.</p>

		<p>People who know Russians in Atlanta can all testify that white Russians living in africanized Atlanta hate the blacks.  They are disgusted by the &#8220;ugly monsters&#8221;, as they call them.  Muscovites tell stories about how proud they are of Moscow&rsquo;s keeping itself white.  Evidently, rich africans can buy property in Moscow, but they aren&rsquo;t given the residence papers that are needed to stay out of jail if arrested.  Muscovites in Atlanta relish in telling stories such as these about their home city. Their racial pride and sensibility shines like a beacon of hope, love, and compassion for the good decision of their kin when telling of their correctness compared to our misery. </p>
<p>Russia, Northern Europe, Canada, and USA should all sign a Racial Mutual Defense Treaty.    </p>

		<p>Excellent job, Jared. I can&rsquo;t imagine what you could have done better. I do wonder, though, why RT lets you espouse your views on their station.</p>

		<p>Alex, RussiaToday is an organ of the Putin regime, which has been frustrated by its poor image abroad, especially in English speaking countries, and by the overall dominance of US and UK-based English language news channels in setting the global agenda.  France has set up a similar channel, but the Russian one has occasional sinister elements, such as news stories bashing the Ukrainian patriotic &#8220;Orange Revolution&#8221; movement that is the main obstacle to Ukraine being re-absorbed into the Russian Empire and with which Americans overwhelmingly sympathize.</p>
<p>I suspect the Russian regime figures that Mr. Taylor is a &#8220;divisive&#8221; figure and that stoking racial tensions and conflict here by giving him a platform will help weaken us.</p>
