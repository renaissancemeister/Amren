<h1>Black Officers&rsquo; Group Calls for Racial Healing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick M. O&rsquo;Connell, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The president of a black officers&rsquo; group blasted the St. Louis Police Department on Monday, claiming it tolerates a culture of racism.</p>
<p>Officer Eddie Simmons Jr. of the Ethical Society of Police said internal affairs officers treat white and minority officers differently, and that commanders often ignore racial slurs used against colleagues and residents.</p>
<p>He also alleged that minority police recruits are punished unfairly, as compared with white recruits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism  &mdash;  it seems that it just won&rsquo;t go away,&#8221; Simmons said at a news conference at the group&rsquo;s headquarters at Delmar Boulevard and Euclid Avenue. The Ethical Society of Police, formed in 1976, was established to help black officers fight for equal rights. Almost all of its 225 members are police officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Isom [Chief Dan Isom] and several members of the top command staff are black.</p>

		<p>The mainline police officers association in St. Louis City is the SLPOA.  Most city cops are members of it, and as a matter of fact, the SLPOA has more black members than Simmons&rsquo;s rinky dink outfit.  Simmons is always in the news with these kinds of musings, because he&rsquo;s trying to drum up membership in his little hustle.  </p>
<p>The SLPOA endorsed CCW when it was up for debate in Missouri in the 1980s through its inception 2003.</p>
<p>Just in case you want to take a gander at their forums:</p>

<p>Does he mean they tolerate racism, because they tolerate a black officers group?</p>
<p>He just called the diversity police on himself. </p>

		<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s no escaping that wicked White racism. It permeates every aspect of Blacks&rsquo; lives. Blacks can&rsquo;t even leave there own homes without being bombarded with the villainous oppression of the White man. Even in their own homes, they are inundated with racism through the tv, internet, radio, magazines and even in their food. Yes, even in the food. Who else is to blame for the rampant Black obesity in America? Evil White men with their wickedly delicious junk food.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;He also alleged that minority police recruits are punished unfairly, as compared with white recruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usual gibberish and stylized angst over nonexistent &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One wonders why minority recruits are &ldquo;punished unfairly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is it because the infractions they engage in are more heinously outlandish, when compared to white recruits? You know the kind of stuff I am speaking of here, failing mandatory drug tests and getting summarily fired versus poor performance tests and subsequent retakes, on such things as report writing or arrest procedures.   </p>
<p>The world has simply become a circus of incompetence, where the &ldquo;freak show&rdquo; is reserved for the competent only.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I still find it hard to believe that white people can sit around with straight faces and participate in a discussion where the topic is the idiot musings of a black officers&rsquo; group. </p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>So not only do we let them push us out of neigborhoods, protest our meager efforts at like-minded assembly, and tell us what words we can and cannot say, but then we don&rsquo;t even have the sense to send them packing when they scream &#8220;racism&#8221; from inside an exclusively blacks-only group. </p>
<p>White people are doomed. </p>

		<p>Racism is at work everywhere.  Blacks are underrepresented among nuclear physicists, MDs, engineers of all types, chemists, mathematicians, biologists, fighter pilots, earth scientists, in fact practically anywhere high intelligence, analytical ability, mental discipline, and perseverance are required.</p>

		<p>I just wonder what the breaking point will be, hunger, unemployment, having your family evacuate a home so a black family can move in, what will the breaking point be?</p>
<p>The only thing they have is what has been freely given&hellip;think about it.  Apart from running fast, jumping high, an the sychopated beat, achievements are extremely limited.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like saying this but the sooner we face a total economic disaster in this country, the sooner the phonies and useless will be outed and true leaders and producers will once again be in vogue.  Hunger has a way of doing that.</p>

<p>Well, how about starting with themselves?  I mean the only people in every mixed community who are race conscious and make trouble over race are blacks.</p>
<p>Too, for &#8220;racial healing&#8221; nationally they might try geting several million blacks to stop with their anti-white hatred.</p>
<p>Only white fools extend a hand of friendship to blacks who are beating on them and robbing them blind and raping their women to the tune of an average 37,500 per year.<br>

		<p>How many of these pitifully treated black cops will let a black thug off the hook? How many will stop and rape a white woman? How many can read? How many have done anything without Affirmative Action playing a dominant role? Hey, if they can pay taxes without getting anything out of it the way I do, racism will die. Until then, these poor bewildered people will just have to continue their tired worn-out complaints. Will they ever get enough to make them happy? I doubt it. Greed begets greedier.</p>
