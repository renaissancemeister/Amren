			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin, Washington Post, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The needs are extraordinary, and the common refrain is that the Americans will provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the Americans to take over the country. The Haitian government can&rsquo;t do anything for us,&#8221; said Jean-Louis Geffrard, a laborer who lives under a tarp in the crowded square. &#8220;When we tell the government we&rsquo;re hungry, the government says, &#8216;We&rsquo;re hungry, too.&rsquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Added Canga Matthieu, a medical student whose school was destroyed: &#8220;The American government should take care of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re well organized. The United States is the richest country in the world, and they can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Markestre Theolien, a supervisor with Haiti Electricity, the national utility, lamented the condition of the 27-year-old transformers and asked for new ones. Asked where the help should come from, he smiled and said, &#8220;U.S.A.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they&rsquo;re expecting us to take over?&#8221; Jacot [Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jacot, an Army engineer] asked a translator. &#8220;No, no, no. How can we assist without completely rebuilding? We&rsquo;re not here to rebuild.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion went back and forth cordially. Jacot said he would be talking with the utility&rsquo;s director to learn what was needed. Theolien defined his bottom line: &#8220;What we really want is the United States to rebuild it, to modernize.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A throng of people in the square discussed their lack of faith in Haitian authorities. One after another, they said their only hope is the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Haitian government has been here for a while, and they give us nothing. The United States should take over the country,&#8221; said Andrelita Laguerre, shepherding four children and a grandchild at the camp. &#8220;Most of my friends expect the United States to take over. I wish!&#8221;<br>

		<p>If any of these people had been asked their opinion of the USA prior to the earthquake, I am certain their response would have been along the lines of disliking the USA, as oppressors, or something less than positive. </p>
<p>Hunger is a powerful force.</p>
<p>Should we be foolish enough to rebuild this mess, once things are good, they will want us out, again as oppressors, imperialists, etc. </p>

		<p>It sounds like by &#8220;taking over&#8221; they mean &#8220;give us free stuff&#8221;.  Either that or they have decided, after 200 years of failure, that they&rsquo;re ready for white rule again.</p>

		<p>Gosh, what a surprise!  The Haitians want us to &#8220;take over&#8221; Haiti, which presumably means providing for the Haitian population.</p>
<p>Apparently, their two century-long experiment with black African rule hasn&rsquo;t quite yielded the results they&rsquo;d hoped for.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t feel bad.  They&rsquo;ve done about as well as has any other country (or municipality, city, state, or country) under black African rule.</p>
<p>And now they want us to feed them, provide housing, clothing, schools, cars, assorted luxuries, and no doubt a bit of walk-around money for good measure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there&rsquo;s nothing we or any other more advanced civilization can do for these people.  They, as a group, simply have no place in a modern world in which intelligence largely determines the measure of individual and societal success.</p>
<p>I truly wish it weren&rsquo;t so, but it&rsquo;s as implacably true as the passage of the seasons.</p>

		<p> So the Haitian people, having proved once again that blacks under any name and speaking any language are incapable of running an effective, honest government, want the U.S. to take over Haiti and &#8220;run things&#8221;?</p>
<p> If that were possible   &mdash;   which it&rsquo;s not (hey, you Haitian people, haven&rsquo;t you heard that the U.S. is now broke, just like you?)   &mdash;   and we decided to do it, then we ought to do it in such a way that they&rsquo;d be BEGGING for a government run by Haitians again. Old-style colonial administrators; forced labor to make sure that a living was finally ground out of this misbegotten country; gang members rounded up en masse and summarily executed; forced sterilization of the poorest women so they wouldn&rsquo;t continue to breed more and more babies to become public charges.</p>
<p> Yes, IF the U.S. were as wealthy as the Haitians think it is, and as it once was, and IF we had leaders who weren&rsquo;t so hobbled by political correctness, given enough time we could probably make Haiti a paying proposition. But then, that would be &#8220;racist,&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>If Haitians want America to take over, it&rsquo;s because they know down deep that things are always better when whites are in charge. A colleague of mine said she talked to a black woman the other day who complained that blacks (still well less than 10% of the total of my city&rsquo;s population) were getting too numerous and that she wanted to move someplace else. Yes, it was a black woman who said that. She freely admitted that too many blacks means a worsening of living conditions and civilization in general. I guess blacks are just more truthful and aware than most whites about the realities of black domination and/or rule.</p>

<p>Sadly, our own government is proving as or more corrupt than the Haitian government, with a great many more lives at stake. And for us taking over Haiti! it seems they had Whites doing that on 2 other occasions and the blacks slaughtered them to a person, any Whites wanna volunteer to go there? </p>

		<p>#5 Matt:</p>
<p>Many years ago a black Bahamian woman I work with was looking to buy a home.  She said she didn&rsquo;t want to buy in a white neighborhood because she didn&rsquo;t want to stand out.  She didn&rsquo;t want to buy in a black neighborhood because &#8220;well, you know&#8221;.  Yup she said &#8220;well, you know&#8221;.  She ended up buying a home in a mostly white neighborhood of a black majority city.  They know that their &#8216;hoods are &hellip;.fill in the blank.  That is why they follow us, to live better.  Unfortunately they never learn from us, they just use their anti-Midas touch to destroy our communities.</p>

<p>Human and animal sacrifice, ritual murder, cannibalism, drugs, torture, mass rape, aids, those liberal do-gooders (nitwits?) got a lot work cut out for them to teach their new &ldquo;kiddies&rdquo; the real voodoo practiced by all Haitians-if only the Haitians would  practice voodoo on White multi-culturists instead of each other!<br>

<p>We can&rsquo;t help. We&rsquo;ve already built complete high functioning cities, the once jewels of the nation and given them to the blacks. We&rsquo;ve donated literally trillions of dollars to the blacks to keep these cities well and all we have to show are Detroit, Philly, Cleveland, D.C., Baltimore, St. Louis, Chicago&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through a few of these quotes.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I want the Americans to take over the country. The Haitian government can&rsquo;t do anything for us,&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>&ldquo;What we really want is the United States to rebuild it, to modernize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Haitian government has been here for a while, and they give us nothing. The United States should take over the country,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereas most Americans simply want government out of our pockets and out of our way the Haitians want government to do something for them. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons their country is in such bad shape. And one of the reasons they have no place in ours. </p>
<p><br>
As bad as the earthquake was they really see it as a lottery ticket. And if we&rsquo;re not careful THEIR disaster could end up being an even bigger disaster for US.</p>

		<p>I guess to Haitians we do seem rich. Do they know how in debt we are to China? We live on borrowed funds. Americans have been told we don&rsquo;t have money to build a secure fence that would protect us from illegal aliens and terrorists. But an earthquake in a third world country suddenly reminds our government that we DO have millions upon millions to hand out. The problem with Haiti is, as in all third world countries, a corrupt government who never thinks of its people, only how it can line its pockets. When we&rsquo;ve seen to the injured, supplied food, medicine and tent cities, Haiti will have to find a leader who will make sure his country is self-sustaining and the people need to be taught the best Biblical exhortation - God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; We cannot continue to be the savior of the world. We cannot even help ourselves right now. </p>

Only the USA is expected to possibly be sucker enough - on account of a long history of incredible sukerdome. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think they want us to actually take over, they just want a few and few of those $2000 FEMA gift cards and for us to build nice new shiny buildings they can loot  &mdash;  what is the point of even having a natural disaster if there is nothing to steal?!</p>
<p>Also to date, their massive orgy of murdering whites  two centuries ago is their sole &#8220;accomplishment&#8221; and the entire basis for their national &#8220;pride&#8221; and ideology so they probably are feeling a little ashamed at their collapsed society and are hoping to maybe rekindle that revolutionary fervor.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it comical how politically incorrect this is? Perhaps the Haitians who want white Americans to take over should talk with any number of big-city black &#8220;radicals&#8221; whose incompetence and destructive policies go unnoticed until, as in Detroit and Baltimore, the offenders are arrested. In the meantime there is a slo-mo earthquake to keep the disingenuous white liberals involved and pleading for taxpayer funds.</p>

		<p>This is yet more proof that any black-run civilization, or semblance of it, is literally bound to collapse, earthquake or not.  I personally do not want our country to meet the same fate, even though it seems headed that way, especially as we continue to take in more of the non-productive but over-breeding type.<br>
 <br>
There is simply no way to succeed with blacks.  They have no qualms about torturing whites with their incessant demands and complaints, with their sense of entitlement.  The more money that is thrown at them, the greater their expectations.  We&rsquo;ve already seen how they operate in our own country, why would we want more?</p>
<p>I say pull up our stakes and leave the quagmire that is Haiti.  Let&rsquo;s fix the mess in our own backyard first.  We can begin by restricting immigration to almost nil.  </p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t THE SLIGHTEST sympathy for these brainless, misguided busybodies who were arested. You can&rsquo;t just go into a country and snatch up children and import here them without going through formalities in both places. They were violating the laws of both countries.   What they did in Haiti was wrong, but what they are doing to the USA is even worse.  Help them there, if you must, but don&rsquo;t bring them here.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans apparently enlisted a clergyman who went knocking on doors asking people if they wanted to give away their children, according to the director of Haiti&rsquo;s social welfare agency, Jeanne Bernard Pierre. &#8220;<br>
  <br>
<i>&#8220;Up until now we have not encountered any who say they are an orphan. One child said to me, &#8216;When they came knocking on our door asking for children, my mom decided to give me away because we are six children and by giving me away she would have only five kids to care for,&rsquo; &#8221; Bernard Pierre said.  Legal experts say taking children across a border without documents or government permission can be considered child trafficking.&#8221; <br>
    <br>
&#8220;They have obviously made a huge mistake by unilaterally going into Haiti and taking children without the permission and knowledge of the Haitian government. It&rsquo;s a crime in Haiti <b>and anywhere in the world </b> to take or abduct children even if the underlying intentions were humanitarian or good in nature,&#8221; said Christopher Schmidt, a lawyer with Bryan Cave LLP in St. Louis.&#8221;</i> <br>

<p>&#8220;One (9-year-old) girl was crying, and saying, &#8216;I am not an orphan. I still have my parents.&rsquo;  She thought she was going on a summer camp or a boarding school or something like that,&#8221; said George Willeit, a spokesman for the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreigners adopting children from the developing world have grabbed headlines recently  &mdash;  Madonna tried to adopt a girl from Malawi amid criticism from locals, while Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a burgeoning multicultural brood.   Haiti&rsquo;s overwhelmed government has halted all adoptions unless they were in motion before the earthquake amid fears that parentless or lost children are more vulnerable than ever to being seized and sold. Sex trafficking has been rampant in Haiti. Prime Minister Max Bellerive&rsquo;s personal authorization is now required for the departure of any child.&#8221;<br>
