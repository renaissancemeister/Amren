<h1>Study: More Blacks Receiving Food Assistance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathy Chaney, Chicago Defender, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a recent study by Feeding America, a Chicago-based hunger-relief agency, 37 million Americans receive emergency food assistance each year and African Americans make up 34 percent of the total. Since the agency&rsquo;s last study four years ago, there has been an increase of more than one million additional African Americans I need of emergency food help.</p>
<p>About 3.7 million African American children were living with food insecurity, an increase of 35 percent from 2.78 million, according to the &#8220;Household Food Insecurity In the United States, 2008&#8221; report released in November.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vicki Escarra, head of Feeding America, said the organization saw the writing on the wall two years ago. Demand at food banks increase about 30 percent, on average, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 678,000 people annually  &mdash;  a 36 percent increase since 2006  &mdash;  are served by the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the county&rsquo;s primary food bank. It supplies nearly 600 food pantries, shelters and soup kitchens.</p>

		<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t need white assistance if they all went back home to Africa and built the glittering, Christian civilization that the American Colonization Society predicted.  </p>
<p>Blacks staying in America are robbing Sub Sahara Africa of its destiny at leading the world in all advancements in philosophy, literature, art, science, technology, democracy, and moral virtue. If they would only go home, we would soon come to them begging for government, schools, hospitals, hand outs, etc.</p>

		<p>Alot of these &#8220;poor&#8221; blacks getting the &#8220;free&#8221; food are not poor. I would guess that in Chicago these food banks are run by the local &#8220;community activist&#8221; ghetto thugs that simply give it away to any and all baby momma\baby daddies that happen to stagger in, without checking, possibly trading food for drugs.  After all, Whitey&rsquo;s paying for it all so, everyone &#8220;heb yo&rsquo;sell&#8221;.<br>
They go there as they would a regular grocery store. Why go to Safeway and pay when it&rsquo;s all free at &#8216;Whiteyway&rsquo;. They have to save their money so they can get their nails and hair done and go clubbin. And if all goes well, they might be able to club a few of those evil White &#8220;racisss&#8221; that donated to that food pantry.  </p>

		<p>3 Tom S.:</p>
<p>I have some war stories in that stead.</p>
<p>The high school I attended in St. Louis had community volunteering requirements.  As luck would have it, my aunt was the coordinator of a food pantry in far south St. Louis City when I was in HS, and the pantry was a relatively easy walk from where I lived.  So I did most of my volunteering at that particular pantry.</p>
<p>When I first started volunteering there, the summer before I started HS, (I decided to get an early jump on all that volunteering hours I needed), my aunt told me that there would be a lot of things I would learn while volunteering that I should either keep to myself or bring them to her if there was any ambiguity in my mind.  </p>
<p>One of the things I quickly learned is that a goodly percentage of people who came in asking for food and for utility assistance, and a high percentage of their black clients, only needed food and utility help because they were wasting their welfare checks on dope, and selling their food stamps (they were paper coupons in those days) for a cash amount less than the value of the food stamps, and using the cash to buy dope.  A lot of them didn&rsquo;t live in the pantry&rsquo;s service area, i.e. you had to live within certain street boundaries to be served at that particular pantry, all the St. Louis area pantries had the are divvied up for that purpose  &mdash;  a fly on the wall told my aunt that she overheard a couple of the clients in on that particular day saying that they &ldquo;stayed&rdquo; clear on the other end of the city.  If those two weren&rsquo;t in the service area, but using fake documentation to suggest that they were, they were only caught because of a snitch (who was white), then there were a lot of them not living in the area and getting away with it.  Also, there was an epidemic of clients selling the food given to them for money, turning that money into dope.  Only a few were caught, but that means there were many more doing it.  The few that were caught doing that were black.  The higher ups, in response to that, had my aunt instruct her volunteers to put pre-printed labels on the foodstuffs, indicating that these items were donated items for pantry distribution, thinking that it would deter some of the re-selling.  But it didn&rsquo;t help, and that should have been no surprise to anyone; the kind of people who would buy such food from the people who are trying to hawk it aren&rsquo;t the world&rsquo;s most upstanding citizens.</p>
<p>My aunt tried three times to report to the food pantry&rsquo;s directors, and the official St. Louis food donation clearing house, about the rampant cheating that was going on.  Every time, she was turned away and called on the carpet for &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;  Most of the pantry directors were high up in the Missouri Synod Lutheran church were the pantry was based, the rest were tied in to some nearby UCC church.  The clearing house&rsquo;s people were all black lovers as well, so it&rsquo;s no surprise her complaints went on deaf ears. </p>
<p>I think my aunt wanted me to keep everything I witnessed between my ears b/c she knew I needed to do volunteering to graduate, and that stirring up dirt would have made life hard for me.</p>
<p>Both the food pantry and the church that hosted it are closed now, the pantry&rsquo;s service area merged with neighboring ones.  My aunt divorced my uncle (the uncle is the blood relation here) a few years after I graduated from HS, then she had a stress-related coronary incident and died a few years after that.  I can just imagine why she was stressed out.</p>

		<p>Of course it is a disgrace that so many people in such a (formerly) wealthy country are reduced to begging for government handouts.  But much of this problem is self-inflicted.  Many Americans, particularly African Americans, have no sense of frugality or long-range planning.  How many of these 37 million Americans have flat screen TVs or cell phones?  I&rsquo;d wager the percentage is fairly significant.   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with people getting help when they need it especially in the times we&rsquo;re living in now.  It&rsquo;s the Christian thing to do.  I do wonder about some people who load up piles of food into grocery carts, pay with a food stamp card and then go home in their $45,000 thugged out SUV.  </p>

		<p>OF COURSE blacks are at the top of the welfare totem pole!!  They have never gotten past the mind set that dictates that someone else has to provide for them.  It started off with the white slaveowners making the provisions, and it has now evolved to where the blacks expect the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t to take the place of the white slaveowner and pay their freight.  Until they get over this, they are going to be at the top of EVERY welfare roll.</p>

		<p>The Blacks are the only group that did not come to this country voluntarily. They were brought here in chains to work the southern plantations. When Marcus Garvey&rsquo;s back to Africa movement wanted to do exactly what many whites wanted but he was opposed by the white community. The current economic crisis has led people who normally did not go to food banks or churches for help are forced to, many for the first time. Many of the African Americans that are receiving assistance could be receiving benefits for the first time.</p>

		<p>So blacks are &#8220;poor&#8221; yet they spend their money on rims and &#8216;bling bling bling&rsquo; instead of taking care of all these children they had out of wedlock?  They&rsquo;re poor, yet I&rsquo;ve seen black thugs driving around in flashy cars?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right!  Blacks get all these preferential treatment, they&rsquo;re free to say and do whatever they want to whites, nobody holds them accountable for their failures or bad behavior&hellip;.yet they are &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m the privileged one.  Right.</p>

		<p>A number of years ago, my mom begged and pleaded me to assist her one day at her church&rsquo;s Saturday free meal for the &#8220;needy&#8221;. Unfortunately, this church was located in an area that was nice prior to the 1960&rsquo;s and the average age of the congregation was in the 55 - 65 range. Most of the volunteers were elderly and remembered the depression. While I&rsquo;m sure hunger was an issue for them, most of the residents in the area probably had deals with the local liquor store to pay cash for the food stamps. (This was still in the paper food stamp days). This was sold to them by the minister as a dire need for the neighborhood, however this was a Saturday only event. The minister at this church used the Seminary to stay out of Vietnam. However his well intentioned, but misguided sense of charity ran up a lot of debt that they could ill afford. </p>
<p>Long story short, what a horror show. Momma waddling in with a bunch of kids in tow and they were not ill dressed or anywhere near famished. Multiply this several times over. Rather than one word of thanks, we were almost treated to derision by a bunch of ingrates. Needless to say, I NEVER again participated in this idiocy. Eventually the minister was forced to move on for this and other ideas that nearly bankrupted this church. I&rsquo;m willing to volunteer to help Caucasians who are in real need, but the heck with minorities who have an overwhelming sense of entitlement. </p>
