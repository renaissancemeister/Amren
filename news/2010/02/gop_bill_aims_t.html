<h1>GOP Bill Aims to Retool Immigrant Birthright Citizenship</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wall, San Bernardino Sun, February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican lawmakers in Congress are sponsoring a bill that seeks to abolish birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrant parents.</p>
<p>Federal law automatically grants citizenship to any person born on American soil, regardless of the immigration status of the child&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that many people come to this country for the express purpose of having children who are American citizens, making the family eligible for welfare and other government benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill does not seek to change the Constitution, which grants birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment ratified in 1868.</p>
<p>Instead, it would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to clarify the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>The measure would limit birthright citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is either a citizen, lawful permanent resident or actively serving in the U.S. military. The legislation would only apply prospectively and would not affect the citizenship status of people born before the bill&rsquo;s enactment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s proponents say the intent of the 14th Amendment was to grant citizenship to emancipated slaves after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The amendment states, &#8220;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller said the words, &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof,&#8221; should not apply to children born in the United States to illegal immigrant parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t tell me a person who is a citizen of any other country is subject to our jurisdiction. They&rsquo;re not,&#8221; said Miller, whose district includes Chino and Chino Hills. &#8220;If their parents are from another country, they are a citizen of that country. They are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adrian Pantoja, associate professor of political studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, said the legislation is &#8220;largely symbolic&#8221; and unlikely to pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a long tradition in America,&#8221; Pantoja said. &#8220;We really don&rsquo;t hold the children responsible for the actions of the parents. It wasn&rsquo;t the child&rsquo;s fault that the parents came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>McKeon concedes that the bill&rsquo;s sponsors face an uphill battle.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t hold the children responsible for the actions of the parents. It wasn&rsquo;t the child&rsquo;s fault that the parents came here.&rdquo;<br>
but when the sole reason for the parents sneaking into america was to give birth to a child so that they could at a later date take advantage of that act, the child should not be rewarded with the gift of US citizenship. not giving US citizenship to the child born to illegal aliens is not a penalty, punishment, or negative consequence and it should not be expected that the child and their parents will suffer for it, and there is no reason they should benefit from it either. </p>

		<p>Long overdue! In the EU only Ireland has birthright citizenship (hence the many Nigerian women who fly in 8.75 months pregnant), but Ireland faces pressure from other EU countries to end this stupid policy. And here in the US, we allow the children of illegals to become citizens  &mdash;  like US citizenship is worth so little that anyone can have it!!</p>

		<p>If anybody out there knows, is the US the only or one of the few countries to automatically grant citizenship to anybody born in the US, regardless of the citizenship status of the parent(s)?</p>
<p>It always struck me as a rather odd and incongruous &#8220;right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t these idiots realize that this &#8220;long tradition&#8221; is going to destroy this country! And just how are we holding a newborn baby responsible for the actions of the parents. A newborn has no awareness as to whats going on. A LARGE % of these babies grow up TOTALLY supported by American taxpayers. And a LARGE % of those grow up to be crimminal thugs and or baby making machines. And the cycle repeats and repeats and repeats&hellip;.. </p>

		<p>The MSM will ignore the story, rather than drool over the prospect of denouncing it. Americans (real ones) will never know of it&rsquo;s existence. The bill will die a procedural death, or else be tucked into even more improbable and unprofitable legslitation, so that it can die, whilst the authors can falsely claim they stuck to their guns.<br>
This cumbling empire cannot return to health, it is also dead.<br>

		<p>Pantoja&rsquo;s is playing wordgames. No one is holding children responsible for their parents crimes. Their parents are not citizens of this country. They are citizens of another country. And their children should be, too.</p>

		<p>Following phenomenal abuse by Nigerians of the birthright clause in Ireland, a referendum was held a few years ago to change the Constitution. Despite universal opposition from the MSM, all the political parties and churches, and all the usual kumbayaa people, the referendum was overwhelmingly carried. Just shows that if you give the people the chance to speak, they will make the sensible choice.</p>

		<p>This was the first and greatest issue when I knew my own government was out to destroy me. After a life time of telling me what citizenship entailed and how it was the most valuable and priceless gift ever bestowed, they start giving it away for free!!<br>
  Like the time my dad started drinking heavily after my mothers untimely death, and then gave away all the family heirlooms to the cleaning lady&hellip;</p>

		<p>The birthright law is one of two of the biggest magnets that draw illegals to this country. Jobs happen to be the other. The citizens of third world nations who invade our country are low-skilled and poorly educated but are cunning enough to game the system. They know just how to get everything they think they have coming. This misinterpreted law has been pushed by the liberals to the limit. American taxpayers fund the births of millions of jackpot babies. It is outrageous. My local paper ran a letter to the editor just yesterday, written by a doctor saying &#8220;anyone&#8221; in this country is entitled to medical help. The whole tone of the letter was &#8220;taxpayers should pay up because we use them to care for our children and build our houses.&#8221; I would not trust one to care for my child not do I choose the workers who would build my house if I were in the market. The good doctor evidently doesn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s the contractor or builder who chooses his/her help. I would also seek out builders who hire only Americans. I&rsquo;m sure many doctors feel that they only see the need to help &#8220;people&#8221; in general and not discriminate, but on the other hand, she almost gloried in the fact of who&rsquo;s footing the bills.</p>

		<p>Article 30 of the Mexican Constitution states that all persons born outside of Mexico are Mexican citizens if ONE OR MORE of their parents are Mexican citizens. Whether they are born in the USA or Russia or China, they are Mexican citizens first. Why do they need addional citizenship just for trespassing??</p>

		<p>These people who say they don&rsquo;t want to hold the baby responsible for their parents actions, are the same ones who would abort a child without blinking an eye. We are not talking about killing anyone here, just sending them back to where they came from. This country needs a very long term moratorium on imigration, and severe punishment for ilegals. Liberals are always hell bent on punishing many, for the benefit of a few.</p>

		<p>Just when you figure you&rsquo;ve heard everyting negative possible about our &#8220;good neighbor to the South&#8221;, a.k.a. Mexico&hellip; these people manage to drag themselves lower.</p>
<p>An news article heard on NPR Radio the other day&hellip; that selling knock-offs of copyrighted designer clothes, pirated copies of music and videos, is a $75 BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR BUSINESS IN MEXICO! Translating that to mean yet more money stolen from our American people!</p>
<p>Mexico most assuredly has to be the most corrupt nation in the Western Hemisphere, if not in the whole world. What I can&rsquo;t understand, WHY our stupid fools making up our federal government refuse to put the screws to Mexico, FORCE Mexico to clean its act up once and for all.</p>
<p>Drive ALL illegals AND their anchorbabies, regardless of age, back across the border. Seal the border. REFUSE Mexicans entry permission as long as Mexico&rsquo;s corruption and drug peddling continue as they do.</p>

		<p>It is far too late. The damage has already been done. Anglo-Saxon civilization in the United States has already reached the point of no return in its descent. Even with zero immigration   &mdash;   which will not happen anyway   &mdash;   Anglos in the US will be overrun demographically well before the middle of the 21st century. They will be surrounded by hostile non-Whites from all sides. Eliminating birthright citizenship won&rsquo;t make any difference in the long-term&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The bill does not seek to change the Constitution, which grants birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment ratified in 1868.&#8221;<br>
When you learn how the 14th Amen became part of the Constitution, you realize it was literally passed in the middle of the night, unlawfully and unconstitutionally. If we as a people had any sense at all, we would want it repealed; if we as a people have any hope for survival, we will demand it be repealed. <br>
But, it may be too late now. Too many people agree with squawk-box heroes like Glen Lee Beck who recently had this to say about immigration: &#8220;More the merrier. Immigrants built this country. Just come here the right way.&#8221; Some say the population is now 300 million. I&rsquo;ll bet the number is closer to 350 million. And GLB wants there to be more &mdash; just be sure the paperwork is correct and you have an Admit One ticket. Now, ol&rsquo; Glenn is really wrenched over illegals &mdash; all those t&rsquo;s left uncrossed; all those i&rsquo;s, un-dotted. Maybe we should help out Glenda Becky &mdash; before we are subjected to the usually torrent of tears: Open the borders. This way, GLB would be happily swashed in millions more of new, not-necessarily-documented, not-like-us type peoples who built this country.<br>
Our country has been living on borrowed time since the 14th Amen was forced through a quorum-less Congress three years after the close of that o&rsquo; so uncivil &#8220;War Between 1861 and 1865.&#8221; If we want to right our country, one thing we must do is repeal the unconstitutional 14th Amen. However, if our attitude is going to be one that says, &#8220;O&rsquo; posh, it&rsquo;s been part of that piece of paper for so long now I don&rsquo;t think we can, or should, get rid of it&#8221;, then we should stop wasting our time worrying about everything. Will we be destroyed? Yes, I promise you we will be destroyed; but, hey, squish yourself into that recliner, pop the top on a cool one, and get yourself entertained watching black crash dummies on TV chasing each other with a football up and down some field or other. And giddily await the American version of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Volcanic ash, anyone?<br>

		<p>We are paying the medical costs of those babies born illegally in the U.S. - they have to go to a hospital to document the birth in this country. If there is no pay-off, those costs, too, will go down. <br>
Grandfather clause: Anchor babies, DEPENDENT on the welfare system for food stamps, housing and utility subsidies, free breakfast, free lunch, free medical care, free ESL education should be deported with their illegal parents. They can come back when they are 18 and can support themselves.</p>

		<p>We have had a choice forced on us: Expel the foreigners and their &#8220;American&#8221; offspring, or watch our country and culture die.  The guilt for whatever suffering the deportees endure lies with the traitors who forced us into this position.  </p>
