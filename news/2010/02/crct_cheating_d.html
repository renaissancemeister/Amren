<h1>CRCT Cheating Details Revealed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristina Torres, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few dozen of their elementary school students had just finished high-stakes summer retests  &mdash;  exams first taken in spring but not passed. With just a glance at the answer sheets, Atherton Elementary School Principal James Berry and Assistant Principal Doretha Alexander saw they were in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot not make AYP,&#8221; Alexander said. Not making AYP, or adequate yearly progress, meant not meeting a required federal benchmark. These students, all fifth-graders, also faced being held back if they did not pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; Berry answered. He pulled a pencil from a cup on Alexander&rsquo;s desk. &#8220;I want you to call the answers to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, he began to erase the students&rsquo; answers.</p>
<p>State officials announced Wednesday that 191 schools  &mdash;  10 percent of Georgia&rsquo;s public elementary and middle schools  &mdash;  will be investigated for possible cheating on state tests. It was the second time in as many years that the state&rsquo;s testing program has come under fire.</p>
<p>The first was last year, when Berry and Alexander got swept up in a groundbreaking audit by the state that included an &#8220;erasure analysis&#8221; of student answer sheets. In the subsequent scandal, officials found tampering at three other elementary schools besides Atherton, including those in Atlanta and Fulton and Glynn counties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Berry and Alexander signed affidavits. Berry admits to erasing and replacing answers; Alexander says she called out the correct answers to Berry but did not personally alter tests. Both also initially denied that they had knowledge of improper activity during the administration of the tests at their school, according to the files.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Improbable gains</b></p>
<p>Their overzealousness was clear from the start.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, prior to the state&rsquo;s investigation, the AJC published an analysis that showed improbable gains at some schools on tests taken first in the spring and then in the summer. One of those schools was Atherton, where half of the DeKalb school&rsquo;s fifth-graders failed a yearly state test in the spring. When the 32 students took retests, not only did every one of them pass  &mdash;  26 scored at the highest level. At the time, Berry told the paper that he knew of no problems with test security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I really didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to the amount of erasing that he was doing,&#8221; Alexander said in her affidavit, according to the files. &#8220;I think there was a total of about 32 tests administered. He told me that he needed for 26 students to pass for us to make AYP.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Denials, then confessions</b></p>
<p>According to the files, both &#8220;adamantly denied&#8221; to state investigators that they cheated or knew of any irregularities. Only after the state made its findings public the following June did both confess to DeKalb school officials.</p>

		<p>Yes, and these products of Affirmative-Action will become physicians, dentists, airline pilots, judges, police, firemen, politicians, etc.  Would you trust an Affirmative-Action African-American Doctor?  Should Michel Jackson have trusted his Black Doctor, or do you think that it would have been better for him to have used a White or Asian Doctor?</p>

		<p>AYP is THE number a school has to make in order to qualify for federal funding.  It is absolutly crucial for the school to make it, because without that money the school can barely function.  AYP is part of the No Child Left Behind garbage that is in effect in every school in the nation.  So, faced with losing key personnel and needed supplies, one can hardly blame ANY principal, of ANY race, for cheating on the stupid state tests.  I would simply suggest that they do it smarter and quieter.</p>

		<p>Where are the black churches? Aren&rsquo;t they supposed to come out in force to show their unwavering support anytime &#8220;the Man&#8221; catches an afro american committing a crime?  When the candle lit prayer vigils? When the demands from jesse, al, lowery, john lewis, the king siblings, heidi b., abe f., etc?</p>
<p>Blacks have a different view of morality and the law than do whites. Blacks contemplate and react on the immediacy of a need, where as law abiding requires a abstract reasoning capacity for cause and effect and a conception of virtue through universal ideals.</p>
<p>The shame is that whites expect blacks to follow the law without constant monitoring and correction. The ante bellum Southerners foretold all that we see today.  They warned us, and are vindicated by each black criminal outrage.</p>

		<p>There is nothing surprising here.  It is an entirely predictable consequence of the No Child Left Behind act colliding with the realities of black academic performance.  Just as in the old Soviet Union we have a system based upon official lies.  Inevitably the internal contradictions break out as corruption, fraud, or scandal.</p>

		<p>When honesty is a trait lacking in society in general, social order will break down eventually.  Basic morality comes from stable, religious homes, and the degree of religiosity can vary from strict to lax, but at least aware.</p>
<p>America used to have a large supply of such homes, producing generally moral people.  There would always be a few bad apples here and there, but the core fabric of society would be strong.  Fast forward to today.  So many broken homes and non-religious and non-traditional upbringings.  Every vice is now a &#8220;lifestyle choice.&#8221;  </p>
<p>We see cheating everywhere now.  People tell lies like it&rsquo;s no big deal.  Students cheat more than ever before.  They will blatantly copy each other&rsquo;s answers in front of adults.  Ask any teacher about this.  Admins are under political pressure to produce good statistics, so they will cheat.  Teachers are about to have their job security linked to whether little shaqwana and jose morales can meet test targets.  So teachers are on the verge of joining in the teaching as well.</p>
<p>No one ever addresses the elephant in the room.  You cannot flood the nation with illiterate third worlders and expect to maintain a civil, educated and honest society.  Even if any school does make genuine progress with the 40-60% of new black and hispanic kids that flooded in that year, the following year, another big batch of illiterates will swamp out all your progress until the school becomes a &#8220;failing&#8221; school - and teachers are blamed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening all over the place in this once great nation.  As recent studies have shown, it&rsquo;s not that the scores of white kids are dropping and that&rsquo;s why our educational system is failing.  White kids&rsquo; scores have stayed about the same over the last 40 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that our overall average is plummeting because we keep adding in kids who are illiterate in one way or another, from broken families and who grew up in culturally self-imposed deprivation.</p>

		<p>We know they are cheating on those scores.  It does not matter if its is proven because the government does not care either.  As long as there is some record that shows improvement that is all that matters.  When born blacks have college seats with their name on them, when they graducate there is a job with their name on it and a guarentee of promotion within one year on the job.  If they cannot do their work, a white low paid assistant is hired to do the work.  If a business needs stuff made, they have it made overseas.</p>

		<p>This is why you can not base a school teachers pay or tenure status on student performance.  No matter how hard a teacher may try their are some children who will not or can not learn.  Children whose mothers couldn&rsquo;t give a plug nickel how well their children do.  Children who are genetically disinclined to learn.  </p>
<p>Many years ago a black columnist (I forget his name) said he welcomed research on genetic differences in intelligence.  His reason was that if it were proven that blacks were different from white kids then perhaps teaching strategies could be developed to specifically address the way blacks learn.  Seemed a sensible idea.  Of course it would never happen.</p>

<p>Amazing. One would think that someone who has attained the position that this princiapl has would know better and that if he was going to cheat, he would raise the results by the slimmest of possible margins, that would still show improvement. But this genius decided he woud rather take 26 students who had previously failed this test and see to it they got the highest grades possible&hellip;.Move along state investigators. Nothing to see here. Those red flags are a mirage. </p>

Every time someone claims they&rsquo;ve found the magic method of raising black achievement, you know they&rsquo;re cooking the books.</p>
<p>A few years back, I started hearing about a program called KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kipp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kipp.org/</a></p>
<p>They made claims about their program producing high levels of graduation and college admissions.</p>
<p>It turns out that they cherry pick candidates to their program. First they find the best and the brightest. Then they screen the parents to make sure the parents can commit themselves and their children to the program. Then the children are given extensive tutoring. </p>
<p>The program appears to work but the program is highly selective as to picking only high achieving minority kids.<br>

		<p>I just love how this newspaper dismisses the cheating as &#8220;overzealousness.&#8221;  Tacking your assignment in football too hard to garner a flag is overzealousness.  Wholesale cheating on tests is criminal fraud, especially if the school would have gotten more money because of what they term adequate yearly progress.</p>
<p>Notice that they cheated too well, to have some of the students doing so well on the test that they scored at the highest level.  If they were going to cheat, they should have cheated only enough to attain the required amount, but not so much as to raise obvious suspicion.  Unfortunately for them, and fortunately for us, any test score gains in black school will be seen as below board.</p>

		<p>Great article.  I think the impact of diversity on schools and education is a great way to reach people. What happens in one school increasingly impacts the students at distant schools - if not immediately while they&rsquo;re in school, then later when the time comes to compete for positions in college.</p>
<p>The thought that their kids might be getting cheated is bound to get parents talking, regardless of their views on race in general.  If the News has taught me anything, it&rsquo;s that the way to get people&rsquo;s attention is through their children!</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be too hard on this guy.  He&rsquo;s only a cog in a machine, desperate to keep his job.  The education industry throughout this country runs on lies, from kindergarten through grad school.  Open dissenters are harassed until they quit.  The risks of cheating are worse that the risks of telling the truth, so he&rsquo;s just following the path his superiors have laid out for him.  </p>

		<p>Sad to say, we had a similar situation in 2001 in our school district when a former supreintendent, Dr. Karen Karch (she is White)bullied teachers into supplying elemenrary students with answers to the state examinations. Last I heard, she left the profession and is now a consultant. Go figure. The story made Time magazine. </p>
<p>I have friends in other school districts accros the nation who have spoke of similar forms of intmidation by school administrators who are interested in &#8220;looking good&#8221; to parents, the local and state media and as well as trying to promote their own career prospects.</p>
<p>This unethical behavior cuts across racial lines.</p>

		<p>That such instances should be on the increase is the logical outcome of No Child Left Behind, which emphasizes frequent high-stakes tests and punitive budget cuts and offers little in the way of helpful policy on how to turn a failing school around.</p>
<p>Of course, altering children&rsquo;s tests is inexcusable and those who succumb to the temptation must be held responsible for their actions. But we must also recognize that when enough negative pressure is applied in any situation, the weaker side of human nature is sure to surface.</p>

<p>Note how once again it took private enterprise to uncover the misdeed that 100&rsquo;s of bureaucrats (I&rsquo;m including all the teachers and school board that should have picked up on this)missed. But don&rsquo;t worry folks, they get the important stuff right like, wars (Vietnam, Iraqi), bank fraud (Including S&L; from 1980&rsquo;s), potential acts of terrorism, budgets, securities fraud (Madoff, World Com, Enron, ), Education&hellip; </p>

		<p>Common sense will dictate that when someone&rsquo;s job depends on an impossible-to-do task, most people will lie and cheat to keep his/her job.  <br>
If race weren&rsquo;t an issue, most politicians and educators would freely admit that some students are just too low mentally to excel.  Before desegregation, teachers spoke of youngsters who were &#8220;not college material&#8221;, and people understood that intelligence or the lack of it ran in families.  Now, this is a verboten topic.  <br>
Occasionally, a black educator will suggest resegregation, and, of course, the MSM doesn&rsquo;t react with the horror that would greet a white suggesting the same thing.  It&rsquo;s little wonder that many black youth in the ghetto are so frustrated.  They&rsquo;re expected to perform at white levels, and the vast majority can&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I was going to say that in a rational country this man would not be a school principal, but after reading the other posts on this thread, I have to believe the system is at fault.  A system based on officially-promoted lies that everyone is equal guarantees this sort of administrative cheating.  When honest people try to function in a system that has been made corrupt at the highest levels, they either become corrupt themselves, or they leave in disgust.</p>

		<p>I worked in a school where I had a phenomenal pass rate for my poor black and latino students.  I worked my head off to teach them and 90% of my students passed Regents (with minimal scores of course, but passing nonetheless).</p>
<p>The principal was an A/A black guy - self-professed former gang member, who had a napoleon complex in a big way.  Needless to say, he was not very bright.  Because he felt threatened by the hyper intelligent white teachers, he went after us one by one and harassed us out.  He also had some insane hatred of Asians and Latinos, though moreso Asians, and he did some insane things to harass them out.</p>
<p>He hired only black teachers whenever a position opened (if there were blacks available), even though they were not too bright nor well versed in their subject matter.  You would think that he would keep the teachers who knew what they were doing and who produced results!  He would&rsquo;ve looked &#8216;reel g&rsquo;od.&rsquo;  Instead, last I heard, he&rsquo;s running a hellhole with 50% teacher turnover every year.</p>
<p>I personally know that he alters records and gives students credits on transcripts for courses they did not pass.  Alas, I left and so did many of my colleagues.  Do not believe any improvement announcements in urban schools.  Do not.  Do not.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;State officials announced Wednesday that 191 schools &mdash; 10 percent of Georgia&rsquo;s public elementary and middle schools &mdash; will be investigated for possible cheating on state tests. It was the second time in as many years that the state&rsquo;s testing program has come under fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most sensible way to determine which schools are cheating is to pick out the ones that have passed, but have large black populations.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;profiling.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a proven successful tactic based on examining those individuals who have long records of doing wrong in the subject being investigated.</p>

		<p>Ironic; these principals are in trouble for altering test scores but for the past 45 years our state and federal judiciary have been ordering government agencies to add 20, 30, 40 however many points it takes to get the scores of black test takers up to passing while at the same time subtracting points from the scores of white test takers so as to make thm fail.</p>

		<p>I have a suggestion. For tests like Microsoft Certification, GRE&rsquo;s, and various other national exams, there are private testing agencies. You want to eliminate the cheating, have the kids bussed to a central location and they take their tests on a computer. Secure Data Storage with almost instantaneous feedback. For additional security, there can be paper copies sent to each school to make sure all numbers match up. </p>
<p>I realize there are some serious incentives to meeting an unobtainable goal. It would be difficult to adopt this idea because it would be a case of the immovable object (Low I.q.&rsquo;s) running headlong into the irresistible force (Political Correctness). It cracks me up that this guy wasn&rsquo;t bright enough to fudge the results just enough to pass AYP and not raise multiple red flags. That or get some blank test sheets, see if you can forge the handwriting and pass 70% (or whatever the minimum needed to keep the Dept. of Education off your back.)</p>
<p>sbuffalonative #13, I looked at the KIPP web site and it is amazing how many of the kids in the pictures (who are black) have a substantial amount of Caucasian blood. My wife&rsquo;s has a female cousin who is white, but married to a man of Chinese Ancestry. He is also a middle school teacher in an inner city school district. This man has told me stories about the &#8220;Charter Schools&#8221; who will hold on to the non-performers long enough to collect the money for &#8220;butts in the seats&#8221; and then they boot those kids back to the inner city schools. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;With that, he began to erase the students&rsquo; answers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard a Kaplan representative explain at a testing seminar I attended that ETS (Educational Testing Services) uses software that sends up a red flag when an &#8216;inordinate&rsquo; amount of erasure marks appear on answer sheets from the same classroom or school, prompting further investigation.  ETS is also alerted when schools show massive &#8216;improvement&rsquo; in their test scores from one year to the next or when all test answer sheets from the same school or classroom show the exact same answers marked correctly or incorrectly.</p>
<p>Different versions of the test are supposed to be distributed in the classroom to prevent copying but in my two-decades experience of frequently giving these tests, this has only happened once.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered if the tests aren&rsquo;t sorted out at politburo headquarters so the same version is sent to each classroom enabling copying/cheating by students OR teachers.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;offers little in the way of helpful policy on how to turn a failing school around&hellip;</p>
<p>Which helpful policy would you suggest be implemented to turn around failing schools? </p>
<p>Failing schools cannot be turned around because it is not possible.  Students with IQs of 85-90 will never achieve past a third grade level and no amount of money or intense instruction will change this fact.  They simply do not have the capacity to achieve past a rudimentary level and until the government admits this (and I strongly believe the educational establishment knows this), it will continue to bleed White taxpayers in the name of &#8216;closing the achievement gap&rsquo;  &mdash;  and proceed to blame teachers and White culture for non-White failure.   </p>
<p>The principal above is the tip of the iceberg viz. cheating  &mdash;  you can bet there are many more intelligent principals than the one above who know how not to set off ETS&rsquo;s red flags and have devised other methods to produce mandated AYP results in what is an impossible situation.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the choices school officials must make:  Either cook the books or risk an undesirable transfer, demotion or more recently, loss of job.</p>
<p>The new non-White replacement class is not meant to be highly educated.  Their purpose is to VOTE along marxist&hellip;democrat party lines, swayed and convinced by slogans such as &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; and promises of endless Free White Money. They are the ultimate useful idiots whose purpose is to out-vote any opposition, to be used as a battering ram against Whites, scream &#8216;Racist Nazis&rsquo; when called upon and most importantly to keep obama-types in power in perpetuity.</p>

		<p>I may be&rsquo;disenfranchised&rsquo; by AmRen readers, but I&rsquo;m going to take a shot at a perhaps not so popular opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure I accept as the total reason for blacks&rsquo; failure to be educated as a low IQ. I&rsquo;m not arguing the statistics for overall lower IQ&rsquo;s in blacks, but I do believe that even lower IQ human beings can be educated to much higher standards than blacks currently are.</p>
<p>I feel it is mostly the lack of responsible parenting, which is part of the entitlement culture whites have created; the get-something for-nothing rewards and the lowering of standards across the board, both in education and employment that has created today&rsquo;s black. We have lowered grade requirements, and, as minimal as they were previously, blacks (AND whites) efforts have dropped even lower. Black children&rsquo;s birthmothers (I refuse to call them mothers, and certainly there are rarely fathers in the picture) are generally uneducated themselves and don&rsquo;t give a tiny rat&rsquo;s patoot about their offspring actually being educated. Thus, there is no help at home (nor anyone even capable of helping) with studies, no diligence about their child&rsquo;s work even being done period. All this has also created a stigma against a &#8216;smart bro&rsquo; in school - he would be ostracized by his own race to the point of injury or even death.</p>
<p>If you take a black child even with a substandard IQ out of the black environment, put him in a home with responsible, caring parents (who actually believe having a child SHOULD change your lifestyle or you&rsquo;re doing it wrong), put him into a white school, that child will still learn. We don&rsquo;t focus so much on someone&rsquo;s IQ if they are responsible, respectful &amp; self sufficient. We DO, however, point out IQ when the package it&rsquo;s contained in is disgustingly lazy, ignorant and costly.</p>

<p>I have no problem with what you said. I&rsquo;m certainly no rocket scientist and I&rsquo;ve done okay for the most part. All you have to do is your best and you should be fine. But blacks haven&rsquo;t been doing their best for over forty years now and show no indication they&rsquo;re about to turn things around any time soon.</p>

		<p>To poster 31, I too have seen some really smart, self aware black kids, but who were held back by a very self-destructive environment and negative cultural background.  With that said, in my professional observation as a long time educator, I would say that about 1/4 of all kids from any ethnic background are naturally low IQ.  1/4 are really smart.  The remaining half are the majority and can be swayed by cultural leanings and lifestyle habits.  In an inner city ghetto, the trend will be downward.  In a suburban setting, it will be upward.  I also don&rsquo;t know how much I buy the genetics is destiny thing because I&rsquo;ve had a lot of black students who were born in Africa, and they were all very much smarter than local blacks here in the USA.</p>
