			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PRNewswire, February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  Few economists would assert that America has a shortage of unskilled labor. Yet every year, employers are permitted to import tens of thousands of unskilled guestworkers to fill jobs the employers claim no Americans want  &mdash;  jobs they claim are temporary or seasonal.</p>
<p>A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies, &#8220;Dirty Work: In-Sourcing American Jobs with H-2B Guestworkers,&#8221; by CIS Fellow and retired Foreign Service Officer David Seminara, explores the H-2B guestworker program, which is for temporary or seasonal non-agricultural work. This paper aims to shed light on the poor conditions that H-2B guestworkers often toil in; to expose the damage it does to the most vulnerable sector of American workers: the poorly educated, students, minorities, and legal immigrants; to examine the recruiters who find workers and the employers who hire them; and to scrutinize the government&rsquo;s role in sanctioning and managing the H-2B bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The report is at http://cis.org/h-2b-guestworkers. Among the findings:</p>
<p>* The popularity of the H-2B program soared from just 15,706 visas issued in 1997 to an all-time high of 129,547 in 2007. Issuances dropped to 44,847 in 2009, as Congress declined to renew a temporary expansion passed in 2005.</p>
<p>* Despite the global economic crisis, demand for H-2B guestworkers remains strong, even in areas with high unemployment rates. American companies filed petitions to request nearly 300,000 H-2B workers in FY 2008. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce listed expanding the H-2B program as one of its &#8220;Policy Priorities for 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>* The H-2B program was originally intended to help employers needing seasonal and/or temporary workers, but the majority of the program&rsquo;s current users are neither small nor seasonal employers, but rather mid- to large-sized companies and recruiters that petition for H-2Bs to work for 10 months out of the year, year after year.</p>
<p>* Many of the businesses filing H-2B petitions for foreign workers are &#8220;body shops&#8221; that have no actual &#8220;seasonal or temporary&#8221; need for labor and instead rent workers out to other firms.</p>
<p>* Despite credible allegations and even convictions for fraud and abuse of both H-2B workers and the program in general, neither the Department of Labor nor the Department of Homeland Security has ever barred a U.S. company from filing H-2B petitions. Some repeat offenders continue to have their petitions approved to this day.</p>
<p>* Economists have found no evidence of a labor shortage in the occupational groups that constitute the bulk of H-2B employment.</p>

		<p>H-2B visas are being used to insource soccer and ski coaches.  They say Americans don&rsquo;t like soccer, but we must like it enough to have so many coaching openings that need to be filled with legal immigrant H-2B visa holders, because of course coaching soccer is a job that an American just won&rsquo;t do, b/c Americans don&rsquo;t like soccer.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s disgusting.  My husband is going back to school for electrical engineering and, although he has several years to go before graduation, the thought of potential job openings being taken by a non-resident instead makes my blood boil. WAKE UP, America-start putting your own people first! Eventually we will have given so much away to everyone else, i.e. manufacturing jobs, tax dollars spent on international aid and now, apparently, highly skilled tech jobs, that there won&rsquo;t be anything left for US.  Americans need to get rid of their do-gooder complex.  Saving the world is all fine and dandy when we can afford it, but we can&rsquo;t.  We need to put ourselves first now. Everyone else will just have to take care of themselves for once&hellip;.like the American people, particularly the (white) middle class, have done since the 70&rsquo;s due to wage stagnation, college cost inflation and the resulting student loan trap, etc.  </p>

		<p>The true unemployment figure is really 21% if you include all<br>
the workers out of work, collecting unemployment insurance,<br>
part timers looking for full time work, and those that ran<br>
out of unemployment insurance, and have given up looking for<br>
work. The unemployment situation is far worse than the <br>
government wants to admit.<br>
With 2 million legal immigrants that the government is<br>
bringing in every year, jobs are going to much scarcer.<br>
Especially for White Males.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unemployment&#8221; figures are cooked and misleading anyway. The important figure is the labor force participation rate.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all about money. Spelled G-R-E-E-D!</p>
<p>In their desperate efforts to get here, obtain a foothold in America, the immigrants WILL WORK CHEAPER than American workers. Which the greedy, profit-hungry business entities and corporations count on. Which explains why employers to through great lengths to &#8220;hide&#8221; their ads in obscure, throw-away newspapers. Then stridently claim &#8220;American&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t take the jobs we offer.&#8221; Or hold salaries down to a point the average American worker simply can&rsquo;t AFFORD to work that cheaply.</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;temporary&#8221; status of immigrants. Nothing is as permanent as a temporary worker! The government could not find the perps behind 911 who overstayed their visas. They could no more readily find guest workers who have overstayed their visa rights by years.</p>
<p>As to the money savings effected by immigrant/guest workers? That pays those astronomical salary/benefits packages enjoyed by corporate CEOs and corporate top brass ih the large corporations. While smaller business entities pocket fat profits for their owners&hellip; at the expense of honest American workers in the unemployment lines.</p>
