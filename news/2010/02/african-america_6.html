			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bonnie Davis, The Grio, February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beasley&rsquo;s story isn&rsquo;t unusual, suggests Knight [Dr. Yvonne Knight, a dermatologist], who has run a dermatology practice for more than 30 years in Richmond, and Dr. Pollard, a plastic surgeon in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Improved technology, less stigma and a desire to look and feel their best are why more black women like Beasley are contributing to the $11.8 billion cosmetic procedure business.</p>
<p>More popular procedures include less invasive facial enhancements and dermatologic surgeries such as Botox, injectable fillers and chemical peels (dermabrasion), and more invasive surgeries such as liposuction, nose-reshaping and breast reductions. For face work, the average cost for Botox injections is $417, and a facelift is roughly $6,532, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Lipoplasty averages around $2,800, rhinoplasty is $4,277, and an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is about $5,263. Insurance rarely covers the costs of such procedures.</p>
<p>In 2008, 907,141 African-Americans had cosmetic or plastic surgery procedures, or 8 percent of the total 11.8 million Americans having such surgeries, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. In 2002, the number was significantly lower, with just 375,025 African-Americans reported having cosmetic surgeries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caucasians had 8.8 million or 73 percent of cosmetic and plastic surgeries in 2008, followed by Hispanics at 1.2 million or 10 percent. Women (92 percent) tend to seek cosmetic surgery more than men, reports the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.</p>
<p>The increase among African-Americans who have cosmetic surgery doesn&rsquo;t surprise Dr. Emily Pollard, who has been a plastic surgeon for 18 years. She became interested in the field when attending medical conferences as a child with her father who is also a surgeon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pollard said body contouring, breast lifts and eyelid surgeries are sought most by African-American women. She does not perform or nose surgeries because she believes it is too personal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Knight attributes African-American women&rsquo;s increased interest in cosmetic surgery to better marketing by companies aware of their growing numbers and influence. Advance research and technology have led to improved treatments and techniques with minor side effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Society and the media have been quite instrumental in driving the quest for enhancement also,&#8221; Knight said. &#8220;Thus, there is more demand from Black women for techniques to enhance their appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knight notes that younger black women in the 20s and 30s seek complexion texture smoothing and improvement of color tones (chemical peels and microdermabrasion).</p>

		<p>This just goes to show: no matter what blacks say, we have to look at what they do.</p>
<p>Chris Rock the black comedian once said that even though he is rich, he could offer to trade places with a White, one-legged busboy and the busboy would refuse, saying, &#8220;No man, I want to ride this white thing out, see where it takes me&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how good it is to be White. And that is why the minorities hate us so.</p>

<p>Say again?  Breast lifts are okay, but nose jobs are &#8220;too personal?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Too personal,&#8221; or simply too <i>obvious</i> that blacks want to look like Whites?<br>

		<p>Blacks often tease whites about how so many of us try to get suntans, &#8220;to look like them&#8221;.They never talk about obout how much they try to look more like us with skin lighteners.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see that black plastic surgery is any different in motivation than white.  Most people want to look good, and if plastic surgery can help that and they can afford it, they go for it, no matter what race they are.  What&rsquo;s the big deal?  Although I would imagine that blacks try to make themselves look more like whites structurally.</p>

		<p>I generally don&rsquo;t approve of any facial alterations.  I am trying to understand what &#8220;complexion texture smoothing&#8221; and &#8220;improvement of color tones&#8221; is and how surgery can affect skin pigmentation. </p>

<p>Texture smoothing is probably done to reduce acne scars especially since the article said young women asked for that. Some blacks have uneven skin tone and dark patches on their face, that maybe what the improvement of color tones implies (or maybe some try to go lighter but I bet most have blotchiness issues). It is not done with a blade but with chemical peels, lasers, things of that nature.</p>
<p>If you have ever watched late night make-up infomercials you would learn all about this stuff.</p>

		<p>This evokes memories of that cartoon/comic strip &#8220;KUDZU&#8221;. One of the characters featured being one Nasal T. Lardbottom, styled as the &#8220;Whitest White Boy in South Bypass High.&#8221; Well, friend Nasal admired and always wanted to be a Brother (Black). So he got himself race-change surgery. But when the bandages were removed&hellip; he was still the Whitest White Boy. Such is life.</p>

		<p>News flash!! To Chris Rockhead. The white guy would have only said,&#8221;I&rsquo;d never want to be black, but I&rsquo;d sure like to ride out all the advantages I&rsquo;d have over cowardly whites.&#8221; And yes sadly many low I.Q. whites emulate gangbanger blacks, what with their plummer crack, no belt, baggy pants, tattoos, body peircings, and hats, worn to resemble a [retard], oops! can I say that word? By the way I wonder if Ms. Knight is really a plastic surgeon? I mean what plastic surgeon wouldn&rsquo;t do nose jobs because they are quote, &#8220;Too personal&#8221;? I think not.</p>

		<p>Whites don&rsquo;t get suntans to &#8220;look black&#8221;.  We get suntans because if one is going to spend much time outdoors during the summer, a tan will help prevent actual sunburn, which can cause skin cancer.</p>

		<p>Excuse me but this is not right. People are obviously off kilter if self-mutilation becomes desireable, no matter what the race. It should not be the goal of White Nationalism to promote such idiocy.<br>
For that matter, I am against all plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons. Surgeons should not be trained to do non-post operative cosmetic surgery; if however it is done it should be monumentally taxed.</p>

		<p>Michael C. Scott, I may be wrong but I believe I&rsquo;ve read that a tan is evidence of damage to the skin, and no protection at all against skin cancer.  Historically, pale white skin was considered evidence of high breeding and income (one didn&rsquo;t have to work in the fields or out in the sun - why so many pioneer women wore sunbonnets).  Beginning in the fifties the paradigm switched, and a tan was evidence of enough time and money to join the jet set, and be able to enjoy time relaxing out of doors (as opposed to being a pasty-skinned factory worker).  Personally, I choose to keep the extremely pale, white skin God gave me, and as I have no desire to look spotted and wrinkled before my time, I avoid tanning (and in my case, burning).  Most Blacks operate under a curious catch 22 - they want to be &#8220;Black and proud,&#8221; (and beneficiaries of all of society&rsquo;s affirmative- action goodies) but they want &#8220;good&#8221; hair and a medium skin tone.  I&rsquo;ve never had cosmetic surgery and only know one woman who has, but my impression over the years is that Black women spend far more on skin and hair conditioners and makeup and perfume than White women ever have.</p>

		<p>Could someone please explain the eyelid surgeries?  Thought that was an East Asian hang-up.  I&rsquo;ve never noticed Black people&rsquo;s eyelids to be that unusual.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s how good it is to be White. And that is why the minorities hate us so.&#8221;</p>
<p>It depends. Whites don&rsquo;t get affirmative action, which can make a huge difference in a person&rsquo;s life!</p>
<p>I mean, where would people like Professor Henry Louis Gates, Dr Leonard Jefferies, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and yes, President Barack Hussein Obama and his wife Michelle, be, and what would they be doing, if they had not benefitted form affirmative action?</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with so-called &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; and everything to do with Black Ignorance, Violence and Stupidity.  As a White, I don&rsquo;t belong in a Black neighborhood.  I have no business there.  It is perfectly understandable why I wouldn&rsquo;t want to live there.  If I work hard enough and run fast away I can get away from Blacks, for the time being. Free association hasn&rsquo;t been declared illegal yet.  </p>
<p>If I rode the &#8220;black thing,&#8221; I&rsquo;d be related to them, so there would be no escaping them.  And, as we all know, wherever the population of blacks gets to a certain level, we have Instant Ghetto.  I will NEVER want to live in some Chocolate City Hellhole like Detroit.  My God, they can&rsquo;t even maintain a perfect infrastructure that&rsquo;s put in place before they take over.  They wreck it.<br>
  <br>
Black people totally overestimate how attached we Whites are to so-called &#8220;White Privilege.&#8221;  Do they really believe it is our privilege to be forced to pay their welfare benefits and other entitlement programs and swallow the blame for everything real and imagined that goes wrong in their degenerate lives?  How can anyone be so damned stupid!  </p>
<p>They totally underestimate how much White people despise Blacks, don&rsquo;t want anything to do with them and the lengths they will go through to keep away from them.  They don&rsquo;t call it &#8220;White Flight&#8221; for nothing.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a White Thing, it&rsquo;s a BLACK THANG, Baby!<br>
