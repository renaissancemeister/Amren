<h1>Aloha Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Review, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bill expected to pass the House today with overwhelming Democratic support would accomplish something peculiar for a liberal republic in the 21st century: {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The legislation is chiefly the work of Sen. Daniel Akaka, another Hawaii Democrat, who has proposed similar legislation in the past, without success.</p>
<p>The Akaka bill seeks to apply the model of American Indian tribes&rsquo; formal sovereignty to people of native Hawaiian ancestry. {snip}</p>
<p>Unlike what is proposed for Hawaii, the recognized sovereignty of the Indian tribes does not derive exclusively from ethnic identity or from ancestry. Rather, those tribes are recognized as sovereign because each represents, however imperfectly, a continuous independent political tradition. Native Hawaiians do not and have not. The bill purports to restore the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii  &mdash;  yes, House Democrats are in fact working to re-establish the sovereignty of a monarchy, odd as that seems  &mdash;  though the monarchy itself was not an ethnically exclusive enterprise, as has been widely documented. {snip}</p>
<p>It is in fact the racial-purity test itself that provides the best argument against a collective sovereignty for ethnic Hawaiians. The Zuni tribe of New Mexico, to take one example, does not need and has never needed legislation enacted in Washington to determine who is and who is not a member of the tribe. Being an actual sovereign entity, the Zunis entered into their relationship with the United States with their tribal identity already well established and their political structures in place. Rather than recognizing an existing tribe, the Akaka bill would in effect create a new sovereign entity where none existed before. In doing so, it would confer enormous benefits on one group of American citizens while excluding another, and would do so along explicitly hereditary grounds. This is quite a different thing than the United States&rsquo;s longstanding tradition of recognizing what we call &#8220;sovereignty&#8221;  &mdash;  in truth a limited and diminished kind of sovereignty  &mdash;  among the Zuni or the Kickapoo or the various Hopi jurisdictions. Even if there had been a kind of collective ethnic sovereignty exercised by native Hawaiians, that sovereignty has long been extinguished: Sovereignty is a political fact, not a racial fact. The United States cannot enter into a relationship with the Hawaiian sovereign because no such sovereign exists. {snip}</p>
<p>For many years, those who were not native Hawaiians were excluded from voting in elections for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, but the Supreme Court ruled that practice unconstitutional in a 2000 decision, Rice v. Cayetano. The Court specifically rejected &#8220;the demeaning premise that citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualified than others to vote on certain matters,&#8221; arguing that such reasoning &#8220;attacks the central meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment,&#8221; which protects citizens&rsquo; voting rights from being restricted on racial grounds. If Congress does not have the authority to restrict OHA voting to native Hawaiians, how are we to imagine that it has the power to create a new Hawaiian Nation, ex nihilo? Better to recognize that native Hawaiians, like the rest of us, are citizens of the United States of America, and damned lucky to be so. {snip}<br>

								<h2>Trouble in Paradise</h2>
						<p>{snip} Sometime soon, perhaps as early as today, the House of Representatives will vote on the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (NHGRA), which is a modified version of legislation that has been kicking around since 2000 and failed to win a cloture vote in 2006.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Once Washington formally recognized the fledgling Native Hawaiian governing entity, that entity would have &#8220;inherent power and authority to determine its own membership criteria, to determine its own membership, and to grant, deny, revoke, or qualify membership without regard to whether any person was or was not deemed to be a qualified Native Hawaiian constituent under this Act&#8221; {snip}, provided that membership was voluntary and renounceable. In other words, the eligibility guidelines laid out in the NHGRA are essentially meaningless. The Native Hawaiian government would be able to confer membership on whomever it wanted.</p>
<p>Its broader &#8220;powers and privileges&#8221; would be negotiated with federal and state authorities. During those negotiations, the &#8220;governmental, nonbusiness, [and] noncommercial activities&#8221; of the Native Hawaiian entity would be exempt from taxation or regulation by the state of Hawaii, and the entity would be shielded from state lawsuits.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why the House elected to consider the NHGRA this week. The reason is simple: Hawaii Democrat Neil Abercrombie, a longtime Akaka Bill advocate, is resigning his seat at the end of February in order to run for governor, and he has been promised that a vote will take place before he departs. The NHGRA enjoys overwhelming support among Democrats and is expected to pass easily. Yet Abercrombie and his colleagues have repeatedly tinkered with the text of the legislation to address the concerns of Hawaii governor Linda Lingle, who has championed earlier iterations of the Akaka Bill but raised objections to the latest version.</p>
<p>The NHGRA traces its roots back to 1993, when Congress marked the centennial of Queen Liliuokalani&rsquo;s removal by apologizing for America&rsquo;s involvement in her ouster and acknowledging the &#8220;inherent sovereignty&#8221; of the Native Hawaiian people. {snip}</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2000. In Rice v. Cayetano, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs could not prohibit non-Native Hawaiians from voting in its trustee elections. &#8220;Ancestry can be a proxy for race,&#8221; wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in his majority opinion. &#8220;It is that proxy here.&#8221; Shortly after the Court delivered its ruling, Senator Akaka introduced his legislation. One of its principal goals was to insulate Native Hawaiian programs and institutions from future legal challenges.</p>
<p>{snip} The new bill would automatically endow the Native Hawaiian body with &#8220;the inherent powers and privileges of self-government of a native government under existing law, except as set forth in this Act.&#8221; As a Republican House staffer observes, &#8220;This is now an outright tribal-recognition bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do Hawaiians themselves think of it? In November, before the revised bill had been unveiled, Zogby International conducted an online survey on behalf of Hawaii&rsquo;s anti-NHGRA Grassroot Institute. After explaining various aspects of the legislation, Zogby found that 51 percent of Hawaii residents oppose the Akaka Bill and only 34 percent support it (the other 15 percent are unsure). The poll also showed that 58 percent of Hawaiians would prefer to decide the bill&rsquo;s fate in a statewide referendum, and that 60 percent of Hawaiians believe the so-called ceded lands (1.8 million acres that once belonged to the old Hawaiian monarchy and were given to the U.S. when it annexed Hawaii in 1898) &#8220;should be used for the benefit of all the people of Hawaii, not just the Native Hawaiians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawaii received a massive influx of Asian immigrants in the 19th century, and it has long been celebrated for its high rates of racial intermarriage. Therefore, it is often hard to distinguish &#8220;Native Hawaiians&#8221; from Hawaiians of mixed ancestry. How exactly would the proposed governing entity identify its eligible constituents? Would it rely on a crude blood quantum (as Congress did in the early 1920s when it passed the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act)? Unlike many American Indians, Native Hawaiians are not clustered in reservation-type communities; they are scattered throughout cities, towns, and villages across the archipelago. If the Akaka Bill were enacted, next-door neighbors could conceivably be subject to different tax codes and different criminal statutes. It would be a logistical nightmare.</p>
<p>And also a constitutional nightmare. &#8220;It is a matter of some dispute,&#8221; Justice Kennedy noted in his 2000 Rice v. Cayetano opinion, &#8220;whether Congress may treat the native Hawaiians as it does the Indian tribes.&#8221; In May 2006, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission urged lawmakers to reject an earlier version of the Akaka Bill, and also to reject &#8220;any other legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American People into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.&#8221; {snip}</p>

<p>I get the sense that what Hawaii is to Democrats, is what the Northern Mariana Islands were to some Republicans, including the infamous Jack Abramoff, and that is, a dumping ground for cheap labor sweatshop factories, and money laundering for the sake of getting money to Democrats.  The Akaka Bill might be key to this.</p>

		<p>What a great thing if Hawaii would be allowed to break off as a sovereign state.  If that isn&rsquo;t possible, I&rsquo;d lide to see them secede.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like having a state in the union that officially encourages hatred and physical attacks against whites.</p>

		<p>Give Hawaii independence excluding Oahu.  Because of Oahu&rsquo;s importance to the Navy and in payment for all the infrastructure built by the United States in the Hawaiian Islands Oahu should be retained as a federal district.  Whites could be relocated to Oahu and non-whites would be subjects of the new kingdom.</p>

		<p>Barack Obama was raised (partly) in Hawaii, right? How does he feel about this, on a personal level?</p>
<p>I live in Canada, and I think that with this Hawaiian sovereignty thing, the US seem bent on making one of the mistakes that were made in Canada, many years ago&hellip;</p>
<p>In Canada, legislation was passed, giving to each Indian tribe the status of a nation. So now, we have about 12 different nations, technically, living in Canada. And Canada is a country of only thirty thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? Blacks are going to demand having a state of their own, within the Union; and they will also, as African Americans, demand to be recognized as a nation?</p>
<p>And what about all the Mestizos, living in California? Will they consider themselves to be a separate nation too?</p>

		<p>Another interesting story out of Canada is the evictions from a reservation of non-Mohawks and that reservations banning of interracial marriages. I heard about it on NPR and it actually sound like a good idea, if only it could be inforced by the law elsewhere. While looking for a site that also says the above one called Digg has more info.</p>

		<p>The phonies at <i>National Review</i> have a real obsession with this case.  It&rsquo;s a cheap and dishonest PR stunt that allows them to polish their &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; credentials in the eyes of the establishment without actually dealing with any real, tough, and  important racial issues.   I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;ve done more editorials on this over the last few months than they&rsquo;ve done substantive editorials on immigration - an actual, important, real issue.   They&rsquo;ll challenge what they see as Liberal racial hypocrisy on this obscure issue but won&rsquo;t challenge Liberal hypocrisy on, say, racial violence against whites.   That would mean real conflict, and conflict with the powerful left on real racial issues doesn&rsquo;t advance their chief goal of servicing Wall Street. </p>

		<p>Hey Francois, if non-whites want to demand separate nations and living spaces, more power to them! As long as they remain in their own &#8220;nations&#8221; and avoid white areas, fine by me. As long as they don&rsquo;t benefit from the privilege of being sovereign while simultaneously roaming through white areas, then I strongly endorse the formation of different nations for different races. </p>
<p>If the Hawaiians want to break off, they have every right to separate and I support them. I only want that same right be extended to whites. </p>
<p>Speaking of whites, I wonder what&rsquo;s going to happen to whites in Hawaii if this initiative passes? I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be subjected to racial hostility and discrimination (as they already are, to some degree) at the hands of the non-white majority. I&rsquo;m not a white victimologist, I just think such a turn of events will be a great wake-up call to whites throughout the nation. Just to clarify, I&rsquo;m not trying to trivialize the potential harm that whites might endure in Hawaii. I just think the actions taken by native Hawaiians illustrates the absurdity of the notion that non-whites aren&rsquo;t vengeful, bitter, or desire revenge. They just want equality and justice, and seek no payback! (Sarcasm Off)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for whites to start making demands, uniting with their fellow whites, and cultivating a greater racial consciousness. Believe me, non-whites and their anti-racist allies aren&rsquo;t taking a breather, so neither can we. </p>

		<p>In Canada, the federal government has recognized aboriginal sovereignty, calling them &#8216;First Nations&rsquo;. Silly me, I thought that I lived in only one nation, Canada. Guess not - there are lots of individual nations within Canada, and I&rsquo;m not just talking about the Quebec sovereignty-association dream. On the west coast, aboriginals can go fishing, but non-aboriginals can&rsquo;t. On the Mohawk reserve in Quebec, they recently kicked out a bunch of people for not being &#8216;racially pure&rsquo; enough. There are different rules in Canada for aboriginals vs. non-aboriginals. That&rsquo;s what happens when you recognize a nation within a nation. You no longer truly have one nation.</p>

		<p>So Apartheid in South Africa was correct after all?  The system designed to ensure thyat each tribe had its own land and government so the black Africans could not take all that the white Africans had built up, and as they are, murdering and evicting white Africans whose families have been there for up to 300 years in many cases.</p>
<p>And after 16 years of the African National Party&rsquo;s rule, that terrorist organisation based on Marxism, the average black African is now no better off, some much worse than under the old white government.  Another big con hoisted on the World.  Anyone thinking bof goingb to see the FIFA Soccer Tournament read the various government web -ites for the warnings on how dangerous South Africa is since 1994.  12 times more likely to be murdered than in the USA.<br>

<p>It is not just separate nations, they want! They are actually trying to make their so-called territories larger, by claiming that some of our territory was offered to them in some long-forgotten treaty, etc, etc.</p>
<p>And in Canada, Indians pay no income tax.</p>
<p>Some of them actually become millionaires!</p>
<p>More power to them, is a very, very bad idea, White Person. And let us not forget, that those people had a stone age culture, when Europeans first came here.</p>

<p>To be frank, I believe minorities already have more than enough power, if you ask me. And I also believe the Powers that be, will never allow Whites to build their own exclusively White nations. But thanks for your opinion.</p></p>

		<p>The Hawaiian Islands are truly among the most beautiful islands in the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one problem with them&hellip;</p>
<p>Hawaiians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met a more hate-filled, xenophobic, ignorant bunch of people. I&rsquo;ll never forget seeing a group of terrified pasty white middle American tourists having the windows of their rental car smashed in by a group of &#8220;locals&#8221; grunting loudly about &#8220;haoles go home.&#8221; The perceived offense? Going to the wrong beach.</p>
<p>The fact that tourism is the largest industry in Hawaii seemed to elude these &#8220;local&#8221; merit scholars.</p>
<p>Anyway, let ALL of Hawaii secede. It establishes a good precedent for future secession efforts. Plus, it will be amusing to hear the crying about the &#8220;legacy of white colonialism&#8221; as Hawaiians slide back into the poverty that we found them in in the first place.</p>

		<p>Chinese are spread around southeast Asia and treat the locals everywhere like dirt.  They own the Phillipines and are building their own segregated Chinese city in Cambodia, outside the capital.  Chinese are about as popular in the neighboring countries as Russians are in Poland or Americans in Mexico.  In 1965,the Indonesians got tired of them a rioted, killing tens of thousands.  If they didn&rsquo;t bribe the governments, they&rsquo;d all be expropriated and expelled.  Chinese have no regard for indigenous peoples, they just find it useful to mouth the platitudes of American leftists when criticizing the US.  <br>
