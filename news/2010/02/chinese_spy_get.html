<h1>Chinese Spy Gets More Than 15 Years in Prison</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gillian Flaccus, San Francisco Examiner, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Chinese-born engineer was sentenced Monday to more than 15 years in prison for hoarding sensitive information about the U.S. space shuttle that prosecutors say he intended to share with China.</p>
<p>The case against Dongfan &#8220;Greg&#8221; Chung was the United States&rsquo; first trial on economic espionage charges. The 74-year-old former Boeing Co. engineer was convicted in July of six counts of economic espionage and other federal charges for keeping 300,000 pages of sensitive papers in his home.</p>
<p>Before sentencing Chung, U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney said he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what information Chung passed to China. &#8220;But what I do know is what he did, and what he did pass, hurt our national security and it hurt Boeing,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>Carney said Chung&rsquo;s scheme with the Chinese government spanned 30 years.</p>
<p>During brief remarks, Chung begged the judge to give him a lenient sentence. He spoke from a podium while wearing a tan prison jumpsuit with his hands cuffed to a belly chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your honor, I am not a spy, I am only an ordinary man,&#8221; he said, adding that he had brought the Boeing documents home to write a book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your honor, I love this country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your honor, I beg your pardon and let me live with my family peacefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples noted in sentencing papers that Chung amassed a personal wealth of more than $3 million while betraying his adopted country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The (People&rsquo;s Republic of China) is bent on stealing sensitive information from the United States and shows no sign of relenting,&#8221; Staples wrote. &#8220;Only strong sentences offer any hope of dissuading others from helping the PRC get that technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government accused Chung, a stress analyst with high-level clearance, of using his 30-year career at Boeing and Rockwell International to steal the documents. They said investigators found papers stacked throughout Chung&rsquo;s house that included sensitive information about a booster rocket fueling system  &mdash;  documents that employees were ordered to lock away at the end of each day. They said Boeing invested $50 million in the technology over a five-year period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his ruling, Carney wrote that the notion that Chung was merely a pack rat was &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; and said the evidence showed that he had been passing information to Chinese officials as a spy.</p>
<p>The government believes Chung began spying for the Chinese in the late 1970s, a few years after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was hired by Rockwell.</p>
<p>Chung worked for Rockwell until it was bought by Boeing in 1996. He stayed with the company until he was laid off in 2002, then was brought back a year later as a consultant. He was fired when the FBI began its investigation in 2006.</p>
<p>When agents searched Chung&rsquo;s house that year, they discovered more than 225,000 pages of documents on Boeing-developed aerospace and defense technologies, according to trial briefs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agents also found documents on the C-17 Globemaster troop transport used by the U.S. Air Force and militaries in Britain, Australia and Canada  &mdash;  but the government later dropped charges related to those finds.</p>
<p>Prosecutors discovered Chung&rsquo;s activities while investigating another suspected Chinese spy living and working in Southern California.</p>
<p>That man, Chi Mak, was convicted in 2007 of conspiracy to export U.S. defense technology to China. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison.</p>

		<p>How did NATIVE BORN WHIETE AMERICANS ever manage to survive without the LEGAL IMMIGRANT chinese? Quite well thank you.</p>
<p>In fact, when there were hardly any chinese in OUR AMERICA, NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS manage to put 12 alpha WHITE MALES on the moon&hellip;.among other things..and this just scratches the surface of what WE achieved when the chinese weren&rsquo;t here&hellip;the chinese would prefer that NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS believe that if the chinese weren&rsquo;t in  OUR AMERICA, the standard of living for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS would plummet. Of course, the complete opposite is true.</p>
<p>The chinese fifth column-because of LEGAL IMMIGRATION- is quite large in America and as a consequence,china is sinking its clawws deep into OUR AMERICA. It must be deported.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s just swing the doors wide open for the H1B&rsquo;s since there&rsquo;s such a shortage of technically trained professionals and engineers in this country.  We need to import more diversity so they can turn around and stab us in the back like this guy.  Do we honestly think that all these indians and chinese we bring in are going to have a single iota of loyalty to this country?  What are we doing to ourselves?</p>

		<p>There is this delusional belief among liberals (and our government) that the second a foreigner steps off the plane and onto American soil that they instantly abandon all loyalty to their country, race, religion, political affiliation, etc.  </p>
<p>Would an American citizen suddenly join the Taliban, Al Qaeda, or the Communist Party simply by entering Afghanistan or China? <br>
  <br>
This is why it is insanity to continue massive immigration of Muslims and others from nations for which we are at conflict or competition.  <br>

		<p>As time goes on, I understand less and less about why we admire the Chinese so much.  Day in and day out I hear the media go on and on about how the West is in trouble and that one day China and India will be the new innovators in every area while the West falls behind.  I will come across at least five articles every day that have titles that convey something of that nature.  But then when I read the content, I find the truth. Behind every great innovation coming out of India and China, there always seems to be some &#8220;help&#8221; from Russia.  The same thing goes for Iran, the other nation we are supposed to start fearing and respecting.  What does this tell you?  It tells me that Asians of all stripes are still helpless without white people.</p>

		<p>How do you know that there were no Asian Americans working at NASA when the Apollo program was going on? Asian Americans tend to major in the sciences and Engineering than whites do. There should be incentives by the government and industry to encourgage more Americans to get the Ph.D degrees in Science and Engineering. This should decrease the number of H-1B visas that awarded.</p>

		<p>Our Rulers know that these foreign techies are not loyal Americans, and that is why they want them here.  To our Rulers, spying is really a minor consideration.  What really matters is that the foreigners are dependent on the goodwill of the Rulers, and so will serve them.  By displacing American engineers with Chinese and Hindus, the rulers will get a docile technical class to help them rule over the rest of us.  That&rsquo;s what the British did, import people from one part of the Empire to another to become the middle class, a class of merchants and clerks entirely beholden to the White ruling class.  </p>
<p>Revolutions are spawned by unhappy bourgeois, not by the hungry masses.  By offering these Asians a standard of living beyond what they could ever expect in their homelands, tolerating their ethnocentrism, and allowing them to lord it over Whites, Browns, and Blacks, our Rulers hope to create a new, more reliable middle class.  And since this new class is a small, racially distinct minority, the Rulers can keep them in line if need be by threatening to unleash the Whites.  The &#8220;Model Minorities&#8221; are tool of the Rulers, and a greater threat than the Dark Hordes.</p>

Here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong. Many young liberal whites DON&#8221;T EVEN CARE if the immigrant has stronger ties to the old motherland than to Uncle Sucker and Americans.<br>
Young White Liberals think the whole idea of &#8220;patriotism&#8221; is dead, meaningless. Their schooling convinced them that nations, especially whiote ones, are unneeded.</p>

		<p>My old neighbour in Australia used to work with the US Air Force. He said they would have demos and exhibitions and routinely the Chinese would turn up snapping photos of models of aircraft and other moderately sensitive things, despite the well-advertised ban of such practice. They would be warned, then be caught repeatedly continuing doing so, until they often had to be removed from the premises, cameras confiscated.<br>

<p>This is EXACTLY the behavior of the Japanese &#8220;businessmen&#8221; and diplomats sent to America just prior to their attack on Pearly Harbor and making war on us.  Of course, the Chinese likely won&rsquo;t have to actually bomb us, since they own MOST of the debt notes floated due to our HUGE and growing deficit.  However, the similarity between the Japanese of the late 1930&rsquo;s and the Chinese of the present should be a huge warning to us.  They bear us NO good will and mean to conquer us one way or another.</p>

<p><br>
The reason this is believed to be the case (especially for China) is because of their new wealth. In the past, China didn&rsquo;t have the resources or stable political environment to do R&D;, but now they do. Only 100 years ago, they were still in the stone age (and much of China remains so); their transformation was literally overnight. The only reason they aren&rsquo;t 1st world yet is because they need to provide for an enormous population.</p>
<p>I reckon an advanced China would be similar to a bigger, badder version of Japan. Russia is currently helping China play catch-up, but give it one or two more generations and I don&rsquo;t think that will be the case. In recent years there have been an increasing number of Chinese-American and Japanese science Nobel laureates, as well as a greater Asian demographic who work for American defense contractors - they clearly have potential. Every major power will spy, but the vast majority of the Chinese (especially the American-born ones) who work for Uncle Sam are innocent, and pre-emptive assumptions of guilt shouldn&rsquo;t occur.</p>

		<p>He is but the small fry in the pond. The big frogs in this particular pond are the CEOs who ship billions of dollars of research and development of their product to China so that they can save a fraction of the cost by the cheaper labour. The same CEOs who are aghast and astonished when China puts an almost identical product on their own markets a year later at half their costs, having saved all the research and development expense.</p>

		<p>Schoolteacher, American colleges/universities are just a few of many places worldwide on a list that China has of recommended places to study. I don&rsquo;t know why Chinese students go abroad, but their reasons are probably the same as everyone elses: education and adventure. Education in China&rsquo;s domestic institutions hasn&rsquo;t reached parity with those in the US yet, so by and large they come here to learn. </p>
<p>As always, some will go home and some will stay and make a life here. People naively tend to think they&rsquo;re some borg-like, cohesive unit, but that&rsquo;s not the case; China makes efforts to recruit/provide incentives for its people to return which often comes in the form of jobs, new facilities to do research etc</p>
<p>The main reason why China is antagonistic towards the US is due to American interference in its affairs (read: Taiwan) and the pervasiveness of US military bases in its backyard, which they consider to be all of East and Southeast Asia. This paranoia surrounding all things Chinese is actually self-inflicted. </p>

		<p>21 Nitrana: How many of the Chinese studying in the U.S. go home afterwards?  A professor I know told me that over 80% stay here.  If these graduates are becoming Americans, this is a huge loss to China.  I don&rsquo;t believe that the Chinese are so self-sacrificing.  They&rsquo;re getting something, which I believe is our secret technology.  Nothing else makes sense.<br>
     I am also aware that China is encouraging its people who have done well in the U.S. and now have American experience as well as American training, to return and start their own businesses.  That hardly reassures me about spying, it only confirms that their true loyalty is to China.  There is a long history of Chinese &#8220;sojourners&#8221; going abroad hoping to make a fortune and bring it home.  This is just a modern variation on an old story.<br>
     I agree with you about our presence in their back yard.  WW2 is long over, Pearl Harbor was avenged, the Vietnamese run their own country, and if South Korea can&rsquo;t handle North Korea, it&rsquo;s not our problem anymore.  </p>

		<p>Amendment to post #22: I neglected to mention that, in addition to their access to our technological secrets, the Chinese benefit by having colonies here, racial enclaves that support the homeland with their votes and bribes.  &#8220;American&#8221; politicians who answer to these kinds of ethnic voting blocs and their lobbies will never place  American interests first.  </p>
