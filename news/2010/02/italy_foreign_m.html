<h1><a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=3.0.4244627457">Italy: Foreign Minister Rejects Face Veil</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adnkronos International (Rome), January 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy&rsquo;s foreign minister Franco Frattini on Wednesday voiced his opposition to the face veil. Women wearing the garment pose security issues and symbolise &#8220;a refusal to integrate&#8221; by Muslim immigrants in a host country, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s ask ourselves if covering one&rsquo;s face isn&rsquo;t the first sign of refusal to integrate and closing oneself off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the host community and its traditions,&#8221; Frattini said.</p>
<p>He was speaking at a conference of young publishers taking place in the Tuscan city of Florence, a day after France moved a step closer to banning the face veil.</p>
<p>A French parliamentary committee on Tuesday issued a report recommending a partial ban on the face veil in hospitals, schools, government offices and on public transport.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the symbol of the repression of women, and &hellip;  of extremist fundamentalism,&#8221; said French parliament speaker Bernard Accoyer upon the presentation of the report.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s parliamentary recommendation is expected to be followed by the drafting of a bill and a parliamentary debate on the issue of the face veil, which has sparked heated debate in many European countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not legislate on the face veil but would tackle the issue through a wider process,&#8221; Frattini said, noting that it raised also security problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;When someone enters a bank or a public office veiled from head to toe, it seems logical to me there is a security issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other Italian politicians have also criticised the face veil. Italy&rsquo;s equal opportunities minister Mara Carfagna said it &#8220;will never be welcome&#8221; in Italy.<br>

		<p>The French and Italians are both fools.  The muslims will never, and can never assimilate.  They will never be French or Italian.  Banning the veil, the burkha, or even mosques will not solve the problem.  You must send the muslims home.  </p>

		<p>Flamethrower (#1) is right.  The only real solution is to deport every last one of them.  Now, if the Muslim woman was going into an Italian Catholic Church, she might get away with saying her headgear was a fat chapel veil, but, even the Catholics might not buy that one&hellip;.</p>

		<p>This is the folly of multiculturalism. It is insane to think that you can take people of all different races, cultures, religions, beleif systems, throw them all together and have peace and harmony. Diversity being a stregth is simply lunacy. All you get is balkenization, disharmony, disunity and tension. Don&rsquo;t worry, if the number of muslims reach critical mass in France, the face veil will become mandatory for all and the cross will be banned.</p>

		<p>I love the Italians for taking the front line against muslims and illegal migrants. </p>
<p>Do you reckon Hillary Clinton would utter the same words?</p>
<p>The English speaking world is PC made, at least the Continentals are questioning muslims and their culture. </p>
<p>The musliss will never abandon the veil so Frattini and others are saying in a round about way that muslims are not welcome withour being too politically incorrrect.</p>

		<p>These folks always talk about a &#8220;veil&#8221;, make it seem we are talking ONLY about a covering for the face. Much more than that. An all encompassing garment, robe covering the feminine figure, slippers, head scarf or shroud, whatever you refer to it as, and the face veil. Sometimes even sunglasses and gloves too.</p>
<p>Slippers not shoes. A man might hear the clicking of the heels as the woman walk, know a woman is approaching, and think of WOMAN! And don&rsquo;t want to see the eyes. Might see a womans eyes and think of woman. Can&rsquo;t have that either.</p>
<p>And the security concerns are valid. HOW do you know that is a woman under the &#8220;garment&#8221;!?</p>

		<p>People should understand the truth - moves like this are a defense of multi-racialism and multiculturalism aimed not at Muslim fundamentalists but at the white native populations;  palliatives to continue the fiction that you can replace your people and magically remain the same nation.  French President Sarkozy recently unveiled a new push for affirmative actions in which he openly pushes intermarriage of French natives with the new immigrants, making the ridiculous statement &#8220;it is consanguinity [same bloodedness] that has always provoked the end of civilizations and societies&#8221;.  When a creature like Sarkozy talks about what is good for the French nation you have to wonder he and his ilk mean by the phrase &#8220;French nation.&#8221;   Sarkozy is a typical modern &#8220;Conservative&rsquo;,  winking at his constituents, pretending he has their best interests at heart all the while selling them down the river to the internationalist, racist left for his own personal aggrandizement.   </p>

<p>  I agree but doubt the European Union would allow such an action. Banning the veil may make certain immigrants leave the country on their own. They must be encouraged to leave and if necessary, paid to leave. The privileged Euro-elites will never allow outright expulsion.</p>

		<p>This whole thing is just a way for the Muslims to see how far they can push until someone pushes back. Think about it, how many lawsuits have there been to get Muslim women to be able to wear their garb at jobs, schools and on their driver&rsquo;s lisences. Then it was to ban pork and Bible story books at non-Muslim owned stores since it would &#8220;offend&#8221; the Muslim clerks to have to touch these things. Dont even mention the foot baths, I have read books by Brigitte Gabriel, who lived in the Middle East until she was 25 years old and had never seen one of these footbaths in any public restroom anywhere. Another issue is setting aside special prayer rooms in PUBLIC schools with large Muslim populations. Remember a teacher can be fired for wearing a cross or reading her Bible on her private time but Muslims get special rooms for prayers. It is time to either strongly regulate Islam or totally get it out of Western countries all together. I would vote for total removal of ALL Muslims from the Western world. </p>

		<p>As much as I agree with Flamethrower and as much as understand the objections of those who criticize the burka ban move as an attempt to fool the Europeans into the notion that peace and harmony of different races and religions can be achieved, I still have much more respect for Italy and France for at least sending the Muslims the signal &#8220;part of your culture is alien to us and we do not welcome it&#8221;. Contrary to these countries, Sweden and Britain don&rsquo;t make even the slightest attempts to show Muslims where the limits are. Nor do the United States, a country which supposedly prides itself in her assimilation of immigrants.</p>

<p>Very recently, I saw a man up on top of the sinks, in the restroom, washing his feet in the sink.  I wondered what that was all about. This was in an airport. So that&rsquo;s what he was doing! </p>

		<p>It is part of their prayer ritual. They have to wash their hands, feet, face, ears, and wipe water over the top of their heads before they pray. If they have had sex with someone or if a woman finishes her cycle then they have to take a complete shower or bath. </p>
