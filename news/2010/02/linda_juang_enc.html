<h1>Linda Juang Encourages a Strong Cultural Identity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Aldax, San Francisco, February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The associate professor of psychology at San Francisco State University co-authored a new study which found that parents who continue to emphasize ethnic and cultural identity in their children beyond the age of 18 are doing a great service to their kids&rsquo; lives.</p>
<p>{snip} [She said,] &#8220;We found that, in general, ethnic minorities  &mdash;  including Latinos, Asian-Americans and mixed ethnic groups  &mdash;  tend to show strong ethnic identity, more than that of European or white American groups. We also found for white students, if their parents did engage in cultural socialization, they tended to explore their cultural background even in higher levels than in minority families.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;It is beneficial .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in terms of [one&rsquo;s] feelings about themselves. There is more life satisfaction [and] self-esteem, and less depression. Humans are social. We need to feel like we belong to a group. We need that to survive.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;[Parents] should continue to engage in discussions about their culture, such as celebrating cultural traditions and holidays, and make sure that is available to their children.&#8221;<br>

<p>That is because it isnt illegal (practically) for &#8220;minorities&#8221; to show ethnic pride. </p>

		<p>Thank you very much, Prof. Juang!</p>
<p>Granted, this article only confirms what all rational people have always known at some level. Namely: We are social beings, rooted in group identity, and; the rootless are perforce a lost lot. Still, at SF State publishing such an article is an act of intellectual heroism.</p>

		<p>Whites are discouraged from being proud of their European heritage, but there is a huge loophole:  It IS perfectly PC to be proud of your specific heritage (Swedish, Italian, English, etc.:  Whites should take advantage of this &amp; cultivate their ethnic identity as openly as proudly as they wish.</p>

		<p>Whites are only encouraged to organize if its to bash whites and say we are &#8216;privileged&rsquo; and evil and oppressive.  But it&rsquo;s nice to see a non-white, even a teacher, say it&rsquo;s okay and natural for even whites to want to preserve their race.</p>

<p>When given the opportunity (or is that political permission) to explore our cultural background, whites do so at levels greater than minorities.</p>
<p>We are not as lost as we&rsquo;ve been led to believe. Our spark is still alive.<br>

		<p>I have seen window stickers, an iron cross with IRISH PRIDE on it, IRISH on the vertical, PRIDE on the horzontal.  Mixed White heritage, maybe?  </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s only the elite left that believes there&rsquo;s something wrong with being white.  Most white people I&rsquo;ve known are fully aware of their specific European ancestry and are proud of it.  Many people in the South are also a tad Native American and can tell you the particular tribe.  <br>
White-blamers do no one any good  &mdash;  especially blacks, Hispanics, and Australoids who they convince are held down by whitey.  Some members of these groups convince themselves that they cannot succeed because of white racism and don&rsquo;t even try to do the best they can.  Worse, self-hating whites tell them they are just as capable as the most brilliant white person and can be anything they want.  Then, when they don&rsquo;t get it, who&rsquo;s to blame?  Whitey.</p>

<p>No-brainer here, since exactly what is it that Blacks and Mestizos are suppose to be realistically &#8216;proud&rsquo; about???</p>
<p>Ah, good thing Blacks and Browns have &#8216;White&rsquo; liberals for &#8216;friends&rsquo;!</p>
<p>With &#8216;friends&rsquo; like these, who needs enemies?!?</p>

		<p>I will assume Linda Juang is Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese are very interested in cultivating cultural renewal and national pride in the Chinese diaspora. Their attitude can be summed up as, &#8220;ask not what your motherland can do for you, but what you can do for your motherland.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they need a trojan horse inside an adversary, such as in an economic and intelligence war with the U.S., they want to be able to call on their sons and daughters of Chinese ancestry. Cultural pride is grooming the fifth column.</p>
<p>Read between the lines, and you&rsquo;ll see this bodes no good for us.</p>
