<h1>Acknowledgement of Racial Issues Needs to Go Beyond Holiday</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rhonda B. Graham, News Journal (Wilmington, Delaware), February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the first black American president feels he can&rsquo;t confab with African-American leaders about jobs in their community outside Black History month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Somehow Black History Month becomes the guilt month for all of America rather than a respectful acknowledgement of the remarkable and necessary accomplishments of a particular segment of citizens. As a result, every issue, from slavery apologies to assessments of the latest U.S. Census tally on the state of Black America, gets lumped into the second month of the year for serious consideration.</p>
<p>To their credit the 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus understand that their constituents can&rsquo;t wait for a holiday-like recognition to challenge joblessness.</p>
<p>For months they have been forcing the issue of unbalanced unemployment and home foreclosures among their constituents. By standing together to boycott a key House committee vote and threatening to abandon support for banking regulations, in December the CBC was able to get $6 billion added to key legislation to help</p>
<p>To their credit the three men at Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting did not make the case for a race-based preference in solutions to the unemployment malaise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in challenging Obama to do more, members of the CBC did what every other congressional representative and senator did in advocating for targeted interests on behalf their constituents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But race is a prickly issue for Mr. Obama. Who said it wouldn&rsquo;t be? Some recognition of the leadership on this issue and even presence at Wednesday&rsquo;s meeting would have been fitting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the Republican Party were smart, it might want to court the mostly Democrat CBC for support, particularly since the president has been beefing so much about bipartisan dialogue.</p>
<p>The always-blunt Congresswoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., challenges the effectiveness of the bailout money that the administration says can help minorities catch up to the new employment realities.</p>
<p>Waters called the respective retraining programs targeted to urban communities &#8220;rip-offs&#8221; and a waste of bailout funds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver points out the administration&rsquo;s blind spot when it comes to understanding the nexus between unemployment and foreclosures. About 50 percent of the nation&rsquo;s foreclosures are on homes owned by African-Americans, which makes the jobs situation for blacks urgent.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re in a training program and you have a notice that you&rsquo;ll be kicked out of your house if you don&rsquo;t make your payment in two weeks, chances are high that you&rsquo;re going to quit the training program,&#8221; Cleaver said. &#8220;We need some immediate help from a program where the government funds municipalities and nonprofits to hire individuals to do real work right now.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I live in Delaware but don&rsquo;t get this rag of a paper.  In fact, I responded to an article on their on-line edition and was banned.  I now proudly wear a baseball cap that says: &#8220;Banned by News-Journal.&#8221;  This paper refuses to print the race of people charged with crimes, unlike other papers in the State.  My crime that got me banned?  I wrote that blacks commit a disproportionate number of crimes, a fact that is supported by FBI figures.  Does anyone trust a paper that refuses to acknowledge the facts?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for Ms. Graham.<br>
Lets do away with Black history month so everyone can be happy.<br>
Whatever happened to respectful acknowledgement of the remarkable and necessary accomplishments of a particular segment of citizens namely Asians who get no recognition whatsoever. After all what have those people contributed? This not even taking the lowly accomplishments of whites and hispanics into account which is why our GOV has no intention of even considering a national holiday for none but the &#8220;master race&#8221;<br>
(in the words of the great ones such as James Cone, Jeremiah Wright, the honorable Louis Farrakhan and the millions of his rightous minions)not to mention our great leader.</p>

		<p>Racial issues?  What about LIFE issues?  We&rsquo;ve been doing &#8220;race issues&#8221; for 40+ years and it has made little change in the attitudes and belief systems, hence economic circumstances, of blacks.  These are what have to change if blacks want any substantive improvement in their situation.  Change themselves first   &mdash;   change on the outside will follow.  That is a spiritual Law   &mdash;   there is no getting around it.  Dealing with &#8220;racial issues&#8221; produces nothing of merit.  Life issues is where it&rsquo;s at - blacks, change YOURSELVES.</p>

		<p>I find it interesting that Carter Woodson, the founder of the Black History observance, felt that the subject could be adequately recognized over the course of &#8220;one week&#8221; per year rather than the entire month of February. </p>

		<p>At this point in history, what &#8220;issues&#8221; exactly do Blacks have that they have not brought upon themsleves, or are responsible for entirely? Thus, Blacks should worry about their own problems, stop moaning and groaning and stop waiting for everyone else - that is to say, &#8220;Whitey,&#8221; to always swoop in and rescue them. </p>

		<p>Blacks are 14% of the US population and for some reason seem to be about 70% of our national discourse.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are talking about crime, the &#8220;diversity&#8221; recession, inefficient government employees, loss of trust in communities, failure of mass transit systems, massive fraud in Medicare and other government programs, bankrupt states and cities, failure of schools, loss of national unity, bogus Marxist political correctness, destruction of equality before the law caused by &#8220;hate crime&#8221; legislation, destruction of white racial unity, affirmative action, transformation of the US from a 90% white majority unified nation that won WWII and put men on the moon, out of control taxes to feed endless welfare programs, degradation of standards, the list goes on and on.   Negative black impact on the US has no end.  There is no leveling up only leveling down.</p>

<p>Excellent points, but I&rsquo;m wondering where your figure came from which says that blacks are 14% of the population.  The last I read was that blacks fell slightly to a little over 12% recently due to the heavy influx of Hispanics, the same as the white population. <br>

Just wait until the next shoe falls and the Obama/Holder administration forbids the FBI to collect, publish, or reveal racial crime statistics. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time. </p>

		<p>Since blacks have a Black History Month there should be a White History Month too.</p>
<p>I support November as White History Month, taking the lead of the BNP.</p>
<p>We should teach white history during Black History Month.  Especially about the lies being told.  Search the net for black invention myths for examples.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Waters called the respective retraining programs targeted to urban communities &ldquo;rip-offs&rdquo; and a waste of bailout funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard, 80% of the bailout funds have been spent overseas, so Americans of any race aren&rsquo;t benefiting from them. More government waste by Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 50 percent of the nation&rsquo;s foreclosures are on homes owned by African-Americans, which makes the jobs situation for blacks urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is this? Well it&rsquo;s because far more Blacks bought homes that they couldn&rsquo;t afford, knew they couldn&rsquo;t afford and lived beyond their means. These Blacks took out mortgages without fixed rates so they&rsquo;d be cheaper at first but the mortgages would be subject to increase. When the inevitable increase occurred, they could no longer afford their homes. Had they bought homes they could afford with fixed rates, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>PS-I&rsquo;d love to buy a home but I can&rsquo;t afford it so I rent. I&rsquo;m not about to purchase something with no fixed rated.</p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t blacks that caused economic harm by living beyond their means, it is guilt ridden white liberals who enact laws demanding equality of results rather than equality of opportunity. </p>
<p>A little reality check for all of you which would like to blame the blacks: Look at the color of congress and Wall Street and ask why Bush AND Obama bailed out the wealthy and stuck it to main street. We were told the &#8220;world would end&#8221; if we didn&rsquo;t act. Really? Were we really going to live in a cave in Montana with guns?

<p>Not in my home. We have always used February as a time to teach our children about the staggeringly high black illegitimacy,<br>
drop-out and violent crime rates, as well as their desire for perpetual victim-hood.  The culpability for the state of the &#8216;black community&rsquo; belongs to the black community.   </p>

		<p>WHAT remarkable, and nessessary accomplishments is she talking about? Oh, and about those retraining programs, if they get more than a half hour off for lunch they&rsquo;d need retrained. So let&rsquo;s get this straight, she&rsquo;s advocating more gov&rsquo;t assistance. In other words a greater redistribution of wealth. Keep on working you white suckers, millions on welfare depend on you.</p>
