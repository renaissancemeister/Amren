<h1>Study: Young Haitian Immigrants May Face Weight Issues</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fred Tasker, Miami Herald, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Haitian immigrant children arrive in Miami, they are far less likely to be obese than U.S.-born children. But they start catching up very quickly, and often surpass non-Haitian children in weight problems, a new study says.</p>
<p>The study, published in the current edition of the journal Ethnicity &amp; Disease, reviewed 30 months of medical charts of 250 children ages 2 through 18 who received medical care at the Center for Haitian Studies, a nonprofit Miami organization that serves the Haitian community. It found that 14.9 percent of children born in Haiti were obese, compared with 17.7 percent of all children in the United States.</p>
<p>However, the Haitian-born children had a 3.7 percentile increase in body mass index for each year of residency in the United States.</p>
<p>And among Haitian children at the center who were born in the U.S., 26 percent were obese  &mdash;  well above the U.S. average for all children.</p>
<p>Dr. Sarah Messiah, a pediatric epidemiologist at the University of Miami Medical School and co-author of the study, said the reasons for the changes are not yet clear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new report resonates with a 2009 University of Miami study that said people born in Cuba, Puerto Rico or Mexico who came to live in Florida experienced increases of 40 percent or more in rates of cancer. In that study, the difference was blamed on the U.S. diet and lifestyle, including weight gain.<br>

		<p>I think this is what happens when you translate a people that are adapted to a low sustenance environment away from their natural environment into a place where food is plentiful.  If your physiology makes the most of every calorie you consume, based on the pretense that you&rsquo;re not going to get many calories, then it stands to reason you&rsquo;ll get obese really quickly if you make it to the land of milk and honey.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Haitian children born in the US likely to get fat.&#8221;</p>
<p>My God I hope not.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if that will prevent them from effectively running from the police, since a VERY large percentage of them are involved with dealing drugs and armed robberies.</p>
<p>Maybe we could initiate a government paid gym membership for each of them just to prove we aren&rsquo;t racist.</p>

<p>Hah, that&rsquo;s an easy one. They&rsquo;re getting fat because of all of the racism they have to put up with in this country. AmRen even posted an article on this issue a while back: <a href="/news/2009/05/perceived_racis.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2009/05/perceived_racis.php</a></p>
<p>The solution, of course, would be for them to go back to Haiti.</p>

<p>Right, sure!!</p>
<p>They metabolize the same food differently, they are not lactose tolerant, etc.</p>
<p>Takes me about 30 seconds to put it all in a comment.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t give them any food stamps or welfare and the end of fat Haitians will cease. Or better yet, don&rsquo;t allow them to come here in the first place. First they complain they are starving (in Haiti) and now complaining they are fat?  What hypocricy.</p>

		<p>Could this be because they drop the typical Haitian diet, full of inexpensive roughage, and begin eating the diet rich in grease and salt preferred by other American blacks?  Just wondering.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if in the US, they have to go to Haitian restaurant to continue eating Haitian food. If they live in an area where there is a high Haitian population, they can get food in an ethnic market, which normally charges higher prices than the local grocery store or corner market does. I can see why they switch to a higher calorie diet that everyone in their neighborhood eats. </p>

		<p>GOSH! with all of the maladies associated with being in the U.S. I think the only humane thing to do would be to see that they never come here in the first place.</p>

		<p>They may face low IQ issues, too. Don&rsquo;t call me a racist; the statistics are available.</p>
