<h1><a href="https://www.cfah.org/hbns/archives/getDocument.cfm?documentID=22219">Most African-American Adults Skip Sun Protection, Study Suggests</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharyn Alden, Health Behavior News Service, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only about 31 percent of African-American adults engage in at least one form of sun protection behavior such as wearing a hat, while 63 percent never use sunscreen, according to a new study.</p>
<p>Melanoma is more than 10 times higher in whites compared to blacks, but over a five-year span, blacks have a 78 percent lower survival rate compared to 92 percent of whites, according to study background material. One reason might be that melanoma in blacks usually is first seen when in an advanced stage, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>Latrice Pichon, Ph.D., of the school of public health at the University of Michigan, led the study, which appears online and in the March issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The findings may point to potential places to intervene in the future,&#8221; Pichon said. &#8220;We can use these data to design sun-safety programs tailored to subgroups of African-Americans, particularly men, and those who have low income and education.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brawley said many dark-skinned blacks do not worry about protecting their arms, legs and trunk from the sun and that might not be a bad thing. &#8220;In my 25-year career, I have almost never seen melanoma in blacks (Brawley is African-American) except on the soles of the feet, palms of the hands, nail beds and sometimes on the scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Brawley said he gives the same advice to light-skinned blacks as he does to white patients. &#8220;When people with a light complexion type go out in the sun, they need to use sun protection to avoid getting sunburned.&#8221;</p>

<p>In ebonics: Damn is I dum. All this time I thought melanin made people superhuman and lack of pigment made people evil. <br>
I&rsquo;ll have to ask Louis Farrakhan why such a superior race suffers shortages of vitamin D in these northern climes. How can the black God have given any advantages to the devils? </p>

		<p>While the world anxiously awaits discovery of the mechanism that allows White racism to affect melanoma survival in Blacks, it takes but a single simple question to illuminate the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;What unknown characteristic might make a dark-pigmented melanoma lesion less likely to be noticed on dark-pigmented skin than on light skin?&#8221;</p>
<p>Could it be SAT scores?</p>
<p>Cultural bias?</p>
<p>A CIA plot?</p>
<p>Or perhaps the evil racist construct known as &#8220;contrast&#8221;?</p>
<p>It will doubtless take the world&rsquo;s scientific community decades to solve this thorny problem.</p>
<p>In related news, diversity advocates were amazed to learn that snow is harder to see on polar bear fur than it is on black bear fur&hellip;  </p>

		<p>Skin cancer is one of the most treatable form of cancer there is but lack of Vitamin D (due to a combination of dark skin+ low exposure to sun rays) can be responsible for more dangerous forms of Cancer as well as diabetes, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and memory loss. Studies done in cold temperate places like Canada have shown that the difference in Vitamin D production in Whites, East Asians etc&hellip; on one hand and darker Arabs, darker South Asians, blacks etc&hellip; on the other is significantly high. The dark populations are not meant to live in the cold north.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that <i>somehow</i>, the reason is Evil White Racism.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t get the point of this article.  Blacks have only 10% the likelihood of getting melanoma than do whites, which causes them to take fewer precautionary measures.</p>
<p>Sounds to me simply like an informed judgment.</p>
