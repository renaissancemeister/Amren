<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mission of the Office of Minority Health (OMH) is to improve and protect the health of racial and ethnic minority populations through the development of health policies and programs that will eliminate health disparities.</p>
<p>OMH was established in 1986 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It advises the Secretary and the Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS) on public health program activities affecting American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>OMH and its regional staff also work closely with State offices of minority and multicultural health.<br>

		<p>About ten years ago, a St. Louis group called BABAA (Blacks assisting blacks against AIDS) received a Yankee government grant like this, for that purpose.  It was used to hire a black male stripper.  I&rsquo;ll leave a lot of the other details out of this post, because they&rsquo;re too risque.</p>
<p>And they wonder why we&rsquo;re running a deficit.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;office&#8221; has been around since 1986? I see that all their press releases talk about giving hundreds of millions of our tax dollars away. OK. How come a) I&rsquo;ve never heard of this &#8220;office&#8221; and b) How come I&rsquo;ve never heard of any RESULTS coming from them giving away my hard-earned tax dollars? I think we all know the answer to these questions is obvious. </p>

		<p>Will the Office of Minority Health be disbanded in 2040?  Or will they just change their name to the Office of Majority Health?  You can be sure that all the other health departments in our government are working just as hard to find treatments and cures for the diseases of non-whites as for whites.  But if you&rsquo;re non-white you get an <i>extra</i> department, all for your own.  Anyhow, add up all those millions and you can see even more costs of diversity.<br>

		<p>I wonder how many blacks work at/in and control the purse strings of this &#8220;organization&#8221; and how many blacks own/run/control the purse strings of the &#8220;organizations&#8221; to which this dept gave money and are they related by blood?</p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Saint Ronald Reagan President in 1986? Wasn&rsquo;t there a REPUBLICAN SENATE in 1986?</p>
<p>The GOP loves to kiss up to the race hustlers.</p>

		<p>What a chilling mission statement!  Since it is impossible to cure those who have HIV/AIDS, this must mean they intend to infect large numbers of whites intentionally!<br>
That is the only way to eliminate the disparity.  </p>
