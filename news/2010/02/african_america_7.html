			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Simkins, Voice of America News, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>February is Black History Month in the United States and Canada, a national observance that pays tribute to people and events that shaped the history of African Americans and Canadians. It&rsquo;s also a time to educate people about the accomplishments of black people and their contributions to society. Last November, two African American astronauts soared into space while reaching new heights in the U.S. Space program.</p>
<p>Six astronauts rocketed toward orbit and the international space station. The mission had special meaning for Dr. Robert (Bobby) Satcher and Leland Melvin. They became the first African American men to fly together on a shuttle mission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still a lot of firsts for us [black astronauts] to do and hopefully we will run out of those firsts pretty quickly because it is certainly my desire that one of the legacies that I would certainly like to leave behind is bringing in more African American astronauts,&#8221; said Bobby Satcher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;So many kids got see two African American men floating around in space.,&#8221; said Leland Melvin. &#8220;For a long time a lot of people were not given that opportunity. There were barriers. With dedication and perseverance anyone in this country can do anything they put their mind to and there are no limits.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s Ronald McNair helped to lift the racial barrier at NASA&rsquo;s astronaut program. McNair and the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger died when the orbiter exploded shortly after liftoff. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back from their recent mission, Satcher and Melvin are trying to encourage black students to think about careers in the U.S. space program. Both astronauts stress the importance of education. Satcher has an extraordinary background, with advanced degrees in chemical engineering and medicine from some of the nation&rsquo;s top universities. He tells teenagers the key to being an astronaut is having a solid background in math and science.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1983, there have been 20 black astronauts in the U.S. space program. {snip}<br>

		<p>You want to really impress &#8220;African-American&#8221; students then send a whole shuttle full of black people and nothing but black people on a space mission.  If not this mission is nothing more than cosmetic window dressing.  We&rsquo;re more likely to see Stephen Hawking and Snoop Dogg on a PBS special discussing the origins of the universe.  </p>

<p>Well, that is what happens with affirmative action in aerospace action; they should have kept him from trying to utilize the control panel as a rap &ldquo;remix&rdquo; device!</p>
<p>Seriously, space travel and exploration should be left only to racial groups that can independently design the crafts, that will see them leaving earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. If you cannot do that on your own as a group, your group has no &ldquo;right&rdquo; to be in space. So far, whites are the only vanguard in this area, with Asians putting in their typical secondary copy and boast attempts at &ldquo;surpassing&rdquo; the white race. Blacks and other southern hemisphere nonwhites, have yet to manufacture functioning aircraft on their own, let alone spacecraft.</p>
<p>It is absurd, as far as I am concerned, that we need to allow any of them to hang onto our coattails and drag us backwards. We alone will break open the secrets of: the time-space continuum, dimensional and extra-dimensional  manipulation, and colonization of terra-formed planets. We are getting there, very quickly; from that point where we do achieve these wonders, only whites should enjoy them.</p>
<p>That is, Mars should be the first whites only planet!</p>
<p>May God let it be so!!!</p>

<p>More African American astronauts can only come at the expense of white astronauts. There are only a finite number of slots in the space program. Those who think there is an infinite amount of anything for those who simply want it are hopelessly deluded. What&rsquo;s more, the pressure to appoint more African American astronauts means that race will inevitably become more important than qualifications. Those who insist on &#8220;X&#8221; number of blacks in any position hate the free market system. They do not believe that free enterprise will amount to fairness in anything over the long run. They hate the free market system and they ultimately want to dismantle it. And how long will we have to wait to see an all-black African nation with a functioning space program. Forever. That is something that Mr. Satcher and the rest of us will never see. Never.</p>
<p><i>With dedication and perseverance anyone in this country can do anything they put their mind to and there are no limits.</i></p>
<p>That is an absolutely terrible thing to tell kids! Can a dwarf become a star NBA player? Can a paraplegic become a football player? This idea that anyone can become anything is one of the most pernicious lies to plague modern mankind. We all have aptitudes in some areas and lack them in other areas and to encourage young people to enter fields in which they have no aptitude because &#8220;you can do anything you want to&#8221; is a recipe for disaster.</p>

		<p>Why does the diversity crowd push so hard for black male firsts over firsts for other so called &#8220;historically disadvantaged groups&#8221; like white woman and Native Americans? In the last election, the Democratic Party had the best opportunity ever to put the first woman in the Oval Office. Nevertheless, the diversity rules required that a black man take precedence.</p>
<p>When will the other &#8220;people of color&#8221; groups start to get jealous of black male firsts and demand some firsts for themselves? </p>

<p>Funny post, paisan. I&rsquo;ll bet McNair thought he was in the Death Row record studio.</p>
<p>As far as black students studying for career in space and astrophysics and the like - doesn&rsquo;t that require advanced knowledge of mathematics, general science and physics? And aren&rsquo;t science labs being dumbed down or eliminated, because of the dearth of black students in them?</p>
<p>John PM, black students ARE taking up space in college - through unqualified AA admissions. Many of them flunk out after finals week. Up until then, they are taking up space.</p>
<p>Have a great one, paisan!</p>

<p>Incidently NASA has also been downplaying the role german rocket scientists. Its a good gauge of how far we&rsquo;ve moved public rhetoric  from reality. The question is how far can we move from reality and continue to function. </p>

		<p>The thing is that we know that probably every Black man or woman who gets a ticket on a space shuttle, gets it thanks to affirmative action. In the same way that most Blacks who attend Ivy league universities get to do so because of the same thing.</p>

<p>Well, I have always wanted to run a four minute mile, be an military combat jet pilot, climb Mt. Everest, hit a baseball like Mickey Mantle. Etc. But knew since I was a kid that NO AMOUNT OF TRAINING, TRY, GUTTY EFFORT, ETC., WOULD SUFFICE. Just because coach said you could do it if you tried, does not mean it can be so. That is not to say that a pretty good level of achievement can be had by a participant in whatever endeavor is attempted, but please!!</p>
<p>I did take the written exam for the TOP GUN program and passed, but failed the medical exam. Vision is too bad.</p>
<p>I had the desire, but not the wherewithal. NOT to my shame either.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I think William Hendershot put it best above, when he noted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;NASA no longer exists to explore space and perform scientific research. Its&rsquo; main goal is to promote diversity. Research and space exploration are OK, as long as they don&rsquo;t impede the new mission of diversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only addendum I can add to that, is that you also make a good point in regard to the so-called &ldquo;universities&rdquo; that we have today, that are nothing more than &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; reeducation centers. It all starts somewhere, and you really hit the nail on the head with that one SF; NASA may be the Red fallout, but our universities (and media) are the originators of that &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; chain reaction and all the subsequent &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; mushroom clouds that created the Red fallout!</p>
