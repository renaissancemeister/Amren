<h1>Law Center Picks and Chooses Tragedies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Spyker, Montgomery Advertiser, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For example, during a recent appearance on MSNBC, the SPLC&rsquo;s Mark Potok implied that Joseph Stack, the perpetrator of the suicide attack on the IRS building in Austin, may have been linked to the &#8220;radical right.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Even an analyst from an organization without the SPLC&rsquo;s $150 million endowment could figure out that someone who quotes Lenin, hates George Bush, is anti-capitalist and pro-socialized medicine is probably not a right-winger.</p>
<p>Potok mentioned that the SPLC didn&rsquo;t have a file on Stack. I wonder why? Probably for the same reason they don&rsquo;t have a file on Amy Bishop, the University of Alabama in Huntsville professor charged with murdering three of her co-workers. As an avowed leftist who was obsessed with Obama, she just didn&rsquo;t fit their profile of what a violent wacko should be (i.e. a conservative good ol&rsquo; boy Republican).</p>
<p>{snip} Amy Bishop killed or wounded every minority member of the UAH biology department faculty. And yet the SPLC, an organization ostensibly dedicated to protecting minority rights, doesn&rsquo;t give this violent racial incident one mention on its Web site.</p>
<p>Apparently, this particular senseless tragedy just doesn&rsquo;t fit with its agenda.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve looked into Joesph Stack&rsquo;s suicide manifesto, and he strikes me as a non-partisan non-ideological middle class entrepreneur who was hassled day in and day out by a lot of people in power, both in and out of government, and one day he just snapped.</p>
<p>What gives it away that I was not his ghostwriter is that the only thing about race is a short implication that blacks and poor immigrants aren&rsquo;t the only ones not laying their lives down for their own freedom.  It is political, but not in a partisan or ideological sense  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t get the sense that Stack was a right-winger or a left-winger, a Democrat or a Republican.  Though he only heaps scorn on one President by name, that being Bush 43, and one major religion by name, the Catholic Church, I think that&rsquo;s just a coincidence, and a result of time and space limitations.  Had he wanted to write 600 pages instead of six, he would have criticized almost every politician from every party on both sides of the aisle, and more major religions. </p>
<p>These are all the queued up frustrations of a significantly more intelligent than normal American middle class independent entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Sam Francis he was not, but I think it was worth reading.</p>
<p>Point being, I don&rsquo;t agree with this writer that Stack was a lefty, as much as I don&rsquo;t agree with Potok&rsquo;s lame attempt to leverage money in saying that Stack was a righty.  Don&rsquo;t forget the Madoff scandal has hurt the SPLC immensely, and they&rsquo;re going to continue reaching further and further down into the barrel to find barnacles.<br>

		<p>No one but hardcore leftists take the SPLC and it&rsquo;s fellow anti-white hate groups seriously.  </p>
<p>When you read their reviews of various works involving race and see how they consist entirely of character assassination and grade school name calling(their recent review of Boedeker&rsquo;s documentary on race springs to mind) it&rsquo;s pretty easy to see why.</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh no, he allegedly posted not so nice things on youtubes in ALL CAPS, clearly everything in his documentary is therefore invalid and racist.&rsquo;  Pathetic, really.</p>

		<p> Yes, the gullibility of the mainstream media when it comes to organizations like this is almost beyond belief. Google any number of persons or organizations who are either conservative, White nationalist, or any other aspect of the &#8220;right wing&#8221; in this country, and it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that the entry will say, &#8220;The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled (fill in the blank) a &#8216;hate group&rsquo; or &#8216;member of a hate group.&rsquo; &#8220;<br>
  <br>
 No thought given by the reporter, apparently, that the SPLC is not exactly a neutral judge of such things. And why should any organization be anointed by the media or anyone else to sit in judgment on the appropriateness of another group, or individual?</p>
<p> Who has decided that, ipso facto, the SPLC is any kind of a worthy organization itself? To my eyes, it&rsquo;s just another group of race hustlers, trying to trade on &#8220;White guilt.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Yes, the gullibility of the mainstream media when it comes to organizations like this is almost beyond belief. Google any number of persons or organizations who are either conservative, White nationalist, or any other aspect of the &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; in this country, and it&rsquo;s a pretty good bet that the entry will say, &ldquo;The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled (fill in the blank) a &lsquo;hate group&rsquo; or &lsquo;member of a hate group.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got it right on, my friend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the lefty rags who go to them.  Fox News with Shepard Smith has Potok on from time to time as an expert on hate groups, and the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor has had either Potok or Cohen on numerous times.  Apparently Fox isn&rsquo;t aware that drawing supposedly valid references from the SPLC is anything but &#8220;fair and balanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written Roger Ailes a number of times about Fox&rsquo;s choice of using the SPLC, because it is an unreliable source with a political agenda, as well as O&rsquo;Reilly and Smith, but I&rsquo;ve been ignored.</p>
<p>The SPLC is Fox&rsquo;s achille&rsquo;s heel in the news business as far as maintaining their credibility.  Others have made the same observation I&rsquo;ve noticed from reading the comments section here and there. </p>
<p>Since the SPLC exists strictly from donations, I&rsquo;m wondering what their situation is regarding cash flow.  I read a while back that their operating account amounted to about 120 million dollars, but it could have been propaganda, because surely they&rsquo;ve suffered a cut-back in funds just as everybody else has.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if the continuing economic downturn caused them to cut back to a skeleton crew of just enough to solicit funds and scream &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; every once in a while to scare society&rsquo;s meek and scared into donating?</p>

		<p>There is a forum I used to post at, which has a debate subforum jam-packed with hard-left egalitarians. The SPLC is so bad, even they collectively roll their eyes at them.</p>
<p>I think they are more about scaring up donations than helping their cause, frankly. I don&rsquo;t think they (or most liberals for that matter) have ever heard the story of the boy who cried wolf. You can see the effect this is having already, when mainstream comedians and TV shows like South Park make racial jokes that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.</p>

		<p>The biases of the $PLC are so obvious only a die hard lefty could fail to see them.  The Wichita Massacre never made it on their list of hate crimes.  The perfectly mainstream immigration reduction organization, F.A.I.R. (Federation for American Immigration Reform) got labeled as a &#8220;hate group&#8221;, apparently because somebody working there said something unkind about illegal aliens.  Meanwhile explicitly racial organizations that advocate for people breaking our immigration laws, like La Raza, get a pass.</p>

		<p>  Some of the posters here are  more gullible than the media. The media is not gullible, they intentionally invite the $PLC because they both have the same agenda.</p>

		<p>News flash!! The MSM has always known about their identical spinner twins at SPLC. If you hear, or read about any act of interracial violence, 99% of the time you can determine, if the perps were non white, if it is even reported, simply by the omission, of the mention, of them being white. Their anti white racist genes will cause them to be stricken with instant color blindness.</p>
