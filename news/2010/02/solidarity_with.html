<h1>Solidarity With Those We Disagree With</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DK, The Kvetcher, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>&#8220;If you hold this conference I will go in there and shoot you.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>If we do not allow for free speech for those whom we disagree with and perhaps even scare us just a bit, how much do we truly value free speech? And if the AMREN conference is now suddenly aborted because of threats and pressures, what has happened to our nation?</p>
<p>What <a href="http://www.realcourage.org/" target="realcourage" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Jeffrey Imm</a></b> and the <a href="http://onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=332:american-renaissance-conference-is-back-on-a-youre-going-to-love-where&amp;catid=29:antifa-news" target="imm" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>&#8220;One People&rsquo;s Project&#8221;</b></a> have done is horrible. It is a blatant form of reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>Solidarity is demanded.</p>
<p><a href="/" target="AR" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>AMREN&rsquo;s website is here.</b></a> Free speech should cover White Nationalists. Not just <a href="http://www.aipac.org/" target="jews" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Jewish nationalists,</b></a> Muslim nationalists, La Raza nationalists, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Man_March" target="blacks" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>black nationalists,</b></a> but even White Nationalists. Why? Because we&rsquo;re crazy like that. Or at least, we used to be.</p>
<p>Below is a segment of the debate between the far-Left Tim Wise and AMREN&rsquo;s Jared Taylor. Out of solidarity for Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s and AMREN&rsquo;s right to assemble, please give it a listen. It&rsquo;s part of a series. And I give both Wise and Taylor credit for their willingness to debate someone with such a radically different P.O.V. than themselves, all the while staying cool.</p>

		<p>If &#8220;The Kvetcher&#8221; is a &#8220;liberal,&#8221; then it is in the nineteenth century sense of the word, meaning one who embraces civil liberties and tolerance of political opinion.  I don&rsquo;t find Kvetcher &#8220;liberal&#8221; in the late 20th/early 21st Century definition, that being raging lunatic intolerant bigot who shuts down &#8220;intolerance&#8221; in the name of tolerance.</p>
<p>I read the comments in the original article, dear Jeffrey Imm is there in full force.  I think he&rsquo;s panicking, why, I don&rsquo;t know.  Maybe the reason is that we might find out that he was involved in the leftist goon tactics, and in that case, he could be a defendant in a TIC lawsuit.</p>

		<p>Well, let&rsquo;s hear it for the Kvetcher - these are the kind of people who USED to be at universities:  the ones who have enough intelligence to allow diverse viewpoints and think for themselves.  Ever since we lowered the admissions standards, the universities have let in lower class and less intelligent students, who have to resort to name-calling and violence to prevent what they are not capable of receiving and considering.  Just another reason to ditch Affirmative Action and go back to PURE ABILITY as the only standards for university admission.</p>

		<p>Noam Chomsky once said, &#8220;&#8221;If we don&rsquo;t believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don&rsquo;t believe in it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to know there are a handful of people on the left who really believe in free speech.  Unfortunately, they are a distinct minority among the left, most of whom are inclined towards Stalinism.  It is clear today that real dissent from the reigning orthodoxy is now as suppressed in the United States as it once was in the Soviet Union.  When one hotel after another canceled its agreement to host the conference this was not achieved by a handful of leftists acting alone.  Not a single politician will dare speak up for the right of American Renaissance to hold a conference.  The mainstream media refused to report on this issue (Gomer Pyle voice: &#8220;Surprise!  Surprise!  Surprise!&#8221;).  Law enforcement ignores the threats of violence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hispanic nationalists have numerous organizations that are not only allowed to freely meet and organize but they get millions from the Ford Foundation, the U.S. government, and major corporations.  They even have their own Supreme Court justice.</p>

		<p>You know, I revisited that debate between Taylor and Wise, but this time I read the transcripts instead of listening to the audio.  I now think Taylor thoroughly won the debate.  Before I thought it was somewhat of a draw.  </p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s rebuttals were much more realistic.  Wise struck me as seeing what he wants to see.  But both were intelligent and both listened to each other and both rebutted the comments of each other.  That is a true debate.  That type of debate is seldom held, nowadays. When people debate, especially politicians, it seems they have cookiecutter answers and one size fits all rebuttals.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the kind of &#8220;liberal&#8221; I used to be (and in many ways still am).  But things change.   I found as time went on that I didn&rsquo;t leave the (now so-called) &#8220;liberals&#8221;   &mdash;  -  the &#8220;liberals&#8221; had left me!  </p>
<p>These screaming maniacs left me somewhere back in the nineteenth century, I guess.  A much saner, more civilized place than this.</p>
<p><br/>
PS. I give Kvetcher credit for his broad-mindedness. I don&rsquo;t expect that he has to agree with us.</p>

<p>Yes, it does seem from the comments on the Kvetcher article that Jeffrey Imm is approaching a meltdown. Perhaps he&rsquo;s tenaciously clinging to his extreme beliefs – because changing his tactics would mean he&rsquo;d have to accept the painful realization that what he&rsquo;s doing and how he&rsquo;s doing it is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>Ghw: I completely agree with your statement. I feel the &ldquo;white liberals&rdquo; abandoned me 30 years ago, as well. Like you, I used to be one, but in the stampede of the liberals towards the dogmatism of the left, I remained standing in the same place, watching them head off a cliff in an orgy of self-destruction. <br/>

		<p>I went to &ldquo;The Kvetcher&rdquo; blog.  He seems like a decent guy.  If you read the comments he had a little mini debat with Jeffrey Imm.  </p>
<p>Jeffrey is still trying to fly his ballooon &#8220;I had nothing to do with the cancellation.&#8221;  The Kvetcher and others saw right through it, though, and lambasted him.</p>

		<p>#4 you raise a good point.  But Jeffrey Imm apparently works for the Department of Homeland Security!  Yes, you read that correctly.  This is really bizarre.  This should be looked into.  These hotels should contact the FBI and complain that the guy that works for homeland security is instigating terrorist threats against those he disagrees with.  </p>
<p>As a commenter on &#8220;Kvetcher&#8221; blog wrote, &#8220;he is an agent provocateur inciting violence against groups he disagrees with and this should be a scary thing for ALL Americans. Our tax dollars working directly against the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is really creepy the way he keeps saying he chooses love over hate as he instigates terror and smears anyone he disagrees with as a hater.  Very creepy.  He should not be working for the homeland security.  </p>

		<p>All I can say is  &mdash;  how Orwellian.</p>
<p>I guess you could call me a &#8220;classical liberal&#8221; too.  I&rsquo;m very conservative, but I believe in God-given rights.</p>
<p>And &#8220;both&#8221; sides are guilty of this.  I remember when the Iraq war first started 7 years ago, people were being called traitors for opposing it.  (Though I wonder if some of these people opposed it just because they were going along with the party line  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m against it because it&rsquo;s unconstitutional, it has nothing to do with being &#8220;conservative&#8221; or &#8220;liberal&#8221;.)  Now these same liberal types are trying to shut down people like Jared Taylor.  They complain about people suppressing their free speech when speaking out against the war, yet want to suppress free speech when it comes to race and other issues.  They accuse us Christians of being narrow-minded, for example, but they themselves are narrow-minded  &mdash;  they don&rsquo;t want anyone to upset their apple cart.</p>
<p>People are so thin-skinned nowadays.  They don&rsquo;t want to be told that they may be wrong about something.</p>

<p>It is interesting that you mentined Noam Chomsky. I was thinking of the same thing. Chomsky unlike most leftist-liberals does not express hostility to the Tea Party movement. He understands that the original Tea Partiers at least were an authentic populist revolt against the beltway consensus. Although he has not publicly stated this, I am 100 percent certain that- based upon other recent comments made by Chomsky- he has a very great fear that the attacks being made on the Tea Partiers by the likes of Chris Mathews, Kieth Olbermann, Rachel Maddow and Democracy now&rsquo;s Amy Godman could push the Tea Partiers into a populist-racialist revolt. How I wish this were true Professor Chomsky. Unfortunately, the Tea Partiers are a libertarian aracial political movement that hangs on to every word of the legal immigration-race-replacement enthusiast Ron Paul.</p>

The only way to get to the truth today is by means of a lawsuit.</p>
<p>AR has had their civil rights violated. They have been denied the right of free speech, assembly, and freedom of association.</p>
<p>The only way to find out exactly how this was done is with a lawsuit. </p>

		<p>1) I often enjoy describing myself as a liberal and then pointing out to these new neo-fascists(see: New Liberals) who also describe themselves as liberals how they are the very thing they claim to be opposing.</p>
<p>I believe in Freedom of Speech, which is all about the right to offend and not about the right to not be offended, which does not exist.</p>

<p>Amen, its the kind of silent pressure that is kept from public view, for fear of letting the public know who they really are.  They are the kind that call the radio station off air to have a host removed with threats of removal of advertising, lawsuits, etc.<br/>
The leftist loons are simply the distraction that takes the hounds off the scent.</p>

<p>When everything at Walmart (and most malls) is made in China, all our computers are made in Taiwan, and well over half of our cars are not made by Detroit&rsquo;s last big three&hellip; any movement that ignores all this while calling themselves &#8216;the tea party&rsquo; is certainly unworthy of the name.  </p>
