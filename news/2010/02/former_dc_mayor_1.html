<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021606054.html">Former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry Is Accused of Corruption</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Craig and Nikita Stewart, Washington Post, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A team of investigators hired by the D.C. City Council accused council member Marion Barry of public corruption Tuesday for securing a $15,000 contract for his ex-girlfriend and taking a cut for himself.</p>
<p>Although Barry has run into legal trouble in the past  &mdash;  including convictions for drug possession and failure to pay local and federal taxes  &mdash;  Tuesday&rsquo;s allegations marked the first time the former mayor has been accused of pocketing taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Barry obtained a contract for Donna Watts-Brighthaupt after lending her money to help pay her bills, according to a report delivered to the council by Washington lawyer Robert S. Bennett. To get some of his money back, Barry at one point delivered a city check to Watts-Brighthaupt, drove her to a bank and waited in the car until she came back with the cash.</p>
<p>Barry, 73, denied the allegations leveled against him. &#8220;I have been in office 55 years, and even my public enemies, my political enemies, my other enemies have never implied that I ever took a penny that wasn&rsquo;t owed to me,&#8221; Barry said from the council dais in reaction to Bennett&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>The report also says Barry &#8220;provided substantial financial benefits to some of his close friends and supporters&#8221; and called for the case to be referred to federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report also found that Barry (D-Ward 8) &#8220;mounted a concerted effort&#8221; to interfere with the investigation by attempting to dissuade Watts-Brighthaupt from fully cooperating with her subpoena.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With his colleagues looking on, Barry told Bennett, who is best known for representing President Bill Clinton during the Paula Jones lawsuit, that he &#8220;resented&#8221; being publicly accused of misusing taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>City and federal laws</b></p>
<p>In July, the council retained Bennett, of Hogan &amp; Hartson, to conduct an investigation into how Barry and other council members use earmarks for programs and projects in the District. Bennett was assisted by a dozen associates as well as lawyer Amy R. Sabrin of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, who served as his deputy special counsel in the probe. The pro bono investigation  &mdash;  which drew on more than 1,000 hours of work and included 43 interviews and 46 subpoenas  &mdash;  stemmed from published reports that Barry had hired Watts-Brighthaupt as a contractor in his office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Watts-Brighthaupt was paid $15,000 in city funds to develop a program called &#8220;Emerging Leaders of Ward Eight.&#8221; And, according to the Bennett report, &#8220;significant portions&#8221; of the program manual &#8220;were copied without attribution from publicly available materials located on the Internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barry insisted Tuesday that he did nothing wrong because the council had no written procedures outlining to whom a council member could give a contract. &#8220;If there are no written procedures for personal service contracts, no written procedures for scope of work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no written procedures for how you evaluate a product, then one who engages in that cannot, cannot be held accountable for violating something that did not exist in the first place,&#8221; Barry said.</p>
<p>The Bennett report concludes that council members are bound by District law, which says that &#8220;no public official shall use his or her official position or office to obtain financial gain for himself or herself or any member of his or her household.&#8221; Bennett concluded that the law also covers boyfriends and girlfriends. Barry is also bound, Bennett said, by federal law, which prohibits &#8220;bribery, gratuities and conflicts of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Millions in earmarks</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barry directed about $8.5 million to 41 organizations in fiscal 2009, Bennett said. Part of that money, about $450,000, was diverted to six Ward 8 nonprofit organizations that &#8220;were conceived by Barry and implemented at his direction by Brenda Richardson, a longtime supporter who managed his Constituent Services Office,&#8221; the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To get the organizations operational, Barry and his staff had to make sure they were legally registered nonprofit groups. Some of the incorporation papers were forged, according to the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. Anthony Motley, a longtime Barry confidant, paid the filing fees with a check from the Marion Barry Scholarship Fund, which was designed to provide scholarships to District residents.</p>
<p>Once the organizations were incorporated, the report says, several of Barry&rsquo;s friends drew paychecks from them. Richardson, for example, was paid $101,363 combined from three of them.</p>
<p>Motley, who received $54,000 from several organizations that had received an earmark from Barry, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a different kind of council member,&#8221; Barry said. &#8220;I ran to get resources, to uplift the people of Ward 8, to do everything I can to empower them.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The shock and/or surprise of this article is, what?  </p>
<p>A majority of voters in D.C. wanted this convicted felon in back in political office so it&rsquo;s all moot at this point. The black toxic-tribe has spoken!</p>
<p>The majority of blacks love the drama, the corruption and the criminal. It&rsquo;s all cultural.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a different kind of council member,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;I ran to get resources, to uplift the people of Ward 8, <b>to do everything I can to empower them.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>&hellip;then no one in the MSM is going to challenge him on his abilities to run for office, or his arrest record, or his judgment, or his possible misogyny (&#8220;The Bitch Set Me Up!&#8221;).</p>

		<p>Barry is DIFFERENT???  Ha.  He&rsquo;s about as typical as it&rsquo;s possible to get.  Black in power = corruption, scandal, drugs, siphoning off public funds   &mdash;   yup, that&rsquo;s him all right.  A garden-variety black in a position of public trust.  Nothing special about HIM whatsoever.</p>
