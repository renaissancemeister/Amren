			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard A. Serrano, Los Angeles Times, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An ambitious, multibillion-dollar project to hot-wire the new Southwest border fence with high-tech radar, cameras and satellite signals has been plagued with serious system failures and repeated delays and will probably not be completed for another seven years  &mdash;  if it is finished at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great idea, but it didn&rsquo;t work,&#8221; said Mark Borkowski, executive director of the electronic fence program at the Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the kickers was that these radars had too many problems with clutter,&#8221; Borkowski said. &#8220;Wind moving a tree shows up on the radar. And if you have too much of that, how do you find the person in the clutter? Same with cameras. The image is blurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problems have prompted Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to order a department-wide assessment of the technology project once billed as the capstone to the controversial 2,000-mile combined physical and electronic border fence.</p>
<p>Borkowski acknowledged in an interview that the government and its main contractor, Boeing Co., had made a series of mistakes since announcing in 2005 the plan to build sensor towers and radar scans alongside the new border fence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the government was primarily to blame for not being more specific in its contract with Boeing. But, he added, &#8220;we have a border we&rsquo;ve got to secure, and technology has to be a key part of the plan. It&rsquo;s not there. So what do we do in the meantime?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the testing has taken longer than planned, costing about $20 million so far, Peters [Tim Peters, vice president of Boeing Global Security Systems] said a much-improved high-tech system would evolve.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the nonprofit Federation for American Immigration Reform, said his group thinks that more and higher conventional fences and old-fashioned border agent surveillance are more reliable than the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of spending a lot of time reassessing,&#8221; Mehlman said, &#8220;they should get out there and do the sorts of things we know work effectively to get control of the border, such as double fencing and more manpower.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a great idea.  It was a lame attempt to fool the political right into supporting amnesty.  It didn&rsquo;t do that, but something of a &#8220;military-industrial complex&#8221; grew up around it, with various defense contractors and tech companies benefiting from the hustle, who use their profits to lobby government to maintain the hustle.</p>
<p>What would a &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; have told us that we don&rsquo;t already know?  &#8220;The virtual fence has found that there are lot of Mexicans, other Hispanics and non-Hispanic illegals sneaking across the border.&#8221;  No duh, sherlock.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Virtual fence,&#8221; what a boondoggle. No surprise a defense contractor got picked to build it. And no surprise it is behind schedule, over budget, and failing its tests. America needs real fences, as part of a defense in depth which would include increased patrols and interior enforcement.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; was never meant to actually work. Everyone knew it wouldn&rsquo;t work from the get-go.  The real purpose of the multi-billion Dollar Virtual fence was to transfer multi-billions of Dollars to the large companies that donate money to the Senators and Representatives who sit on the committees who oversee our Nation&rsquo;s Borders.  </p>
<p>Note that for substantially less money than was spent on this failed still-birth, we could have build a &#8220;real&#8221; fence that actually worked.  Also, we could have put tens of thousands of unemployed, low-skilled Americans to work, building the fence.   This illustrates the deep corruption that today passes for our government.   </p>

		<p>In just a few short years we built rockets and sent men to the moon.  During WWII we built hundreds of thousands of tanks, planes, and ships.  In just 15 years we built the first nationwide highway system   &mdash;   North to South and Coast-to-coast.  </p>
<p>Yet, we cannot build a simple fence?  Something is very, very rotten in Washington.</p>

<p>Anybody that thinks a fence on the southern border isn&rsquo;t going to, at the very least, reduce the number of infiltrations is someone who has a problem with common sense and logic.</p>
<p>And anyone who thinks ladders are the answer to any fence is someone who knows zero about military tactics and maneuvers and is just too naive to give an opinion on anything.  Fences are a necessary part of a broader line of defense.  </p>
<p>But, the left doesn&rsquo;t want fences, because they think they won&rsquo;t work.  They don&rsquo;t want them, of course, because their hare-brained philosophy about creating a multicultural utopia would be in great jeopardy if people were not allowed to inundate this nation.  They want unchecked infiltration.  If there are numerous tribes within this nation, then there is less chance of any one group being strong enough to fall into nationalism which the leftist radicals childishly see as their enemy.  BUT, it is multiculturalism that will see their plans fail, not conservatism or anything else.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had free rein to do as they wish for years now and the entire West has degenerated every year under their control.  it couldn&rsquo;t be plainer to anybody with half a brain that the leftist agenda is a self-destruct mechanism that was doomed to fail from the start.</p>
<p>So, they don&rsquo;t want a fence, because they claim fences don&rsquo;t work?  O.k.  No problem.  Now let&rsquo;s see how this all turns out as it gets closer to the grand finale.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see any of these unbelievers in fences try to sneak into North Korea.  <br>
Let&rsquo;s see them sneak into any Senator&rsquo;s house.<br>
     This country has millions of miles of security fences, all places with the expectation that they will dissuade or at least delay the unwanted.  Every last person in this country knows that fences work.  Everyone who denies that they will work on the border is a liar.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something curious, about that state-of-the-art piece of technology not working the way it was supposed to. Or designed to.</p>
<p>Could it be that the fence might have worked, really well, but that some people in Washington didn&rsquo;t want it to serve its purpose?</p>
<p>Obama and McCain, were talking about giving amnesty to illegals, all through the last presidential campaign. I suppose that was because both have a lot of &#8220;friends&#8221; who run businesses. And those &#8220;friends&#8221; may like to hire illegals, and pay them lower salaries than they would pay American citizens&hellip;</p>
<p>A working high-tech fence might have cost a lot of money to those friends, because they would have had to hire, not quite as many illegals, but a lot more more Americans.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone decided that there was really no rush, for the fence to become fully operational!</p>
<p>America put men on the moon; and about 25 years ago, America had the technology to nuke Russia and China. And the use of satellites has been common for many, many years, now.</p>
<p>So how come all of a sudden, the military-industrial complex is incapable make a fence with a few infra-red sensors and radar systems work properly?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the illegals who cross the border, had some kind of stealth or radar jamming technology, right?</p>

<p>Exactly!  In other words, they want (and are getting) a return to the same tangled jigsaw puzzle of warring tribes that existed on this continent before the arrival of Europeans pacified it.   Is that progress?    Geeze!  Don&rsquo;t people ever learn? </p>

		<p>I am sick and tired of these excuses about how we can&rsquo;t do this and we can&rsquo;t do that to protect our country.</p>
<p>If our government really wanted to stop this invasion of illegal aliens, they could do it almost overnight.  We could put an old fashioned fence on the border and back it up by armed troops with orders to actually stop the invasion, instead of treating the invaders in our typical &#8220;touchy feely and political correct manner.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The headlines that say whites will be a minority by the year 2040, or 2050, or whatever do not have to come true.  We can still save this country from the invasion.  But we really must want to do it.</p>
<p>The previous posters hit it right on the head though, when they said the fence was never intended to work.  Absolutely.  It was just another ploy by the traitors in our government to make it look like they were trying to do something, while not actually doing anything.  Way to go government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government by the government and for the government.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s the way it is now.  (It used to be government by the people and for the people).</p>

		<p>The government of India just recently completed their 4,500 kilometer fence around Bangladesh. Completely surrounding Bangla with a 12 foot high double fence, the gap in between the two fences filled with razor wire. A fence lit at night and patrolled by squads of quasi-military units armed with assault rifles. That distance of 4,500 kilometers is far further than the length of the border between the U.S. and Mex.</p>
<p>And IS NOT A VIRTUAL FENCE, IS A REAL FENCE!!</p>
<p>Well, of course, the question is immediately asked - - if the Indians can do it, why can&rsquo;t the &hellip; do it??!!</p>

		<p>In one morning in June 1944, 900 Germans defending 6000 yards of beach killed and wounded 4000 American attackers.  The Germans were driven off only when American destroyers with 5&#8221; guns closed with the shore and shot it out with the infantry.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that sturdy fences, backed with a few stout men, cannot stop the foreigners.  <br>
     Given a good fence and modern military technology, I&rsquo;m going to guess it would take maybe three Army divisions to guard the Mexican border against enemy infiltration.  Pull them out of the Middle East, the Iraqis would never miss them.  </p>

		<p>We have the technology to send men to the moon and back and that was back in 1969.</p>
<p>So now the power elites are telling us in the year 2010 we can&rsquo;t build a fence with radar sensors because a bunch of swaying trees in the wind is messing up the sensor readings and that&rsquo;s beyond our technological capacity to solve.</p>

		<p>How about a low-tech but highly cost-effective idea? A simple multiple-strand barbed-wire fence&hellip; with a hundred yards of MINED GROUND on either side? Anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines liberally placed. With plentiful pictographs and Spanish language warning signs on the Mexican side. To the effect that crossing the minefield could be very hazardous to your health.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something wrong here, an invisible 800 pound gorilla in the room.  Every single day, floods of illegals are entering our country from the south. Soon, all of Mexico will have &#8216;crossed&rsquo;. Now, this has been going on for (decades?), with no end in sight.  Why is this? Why has this not BEEN STOPPED? There must be a reason, or three.  Could it be that these are new liberal voters and desired by the left?  Or: America&rsquo;s biggest export now is THE WAR MACHINE.  But where will these bodies come from? Surely not little Johnny or Bobby.  Instead, let&rsquo;s put these illegals in uniforms, allow them to serve, and become U.S. Citizens upon completion of their terms.  JOSE and ROBERTO, welcome the UNITED STATES!</p>

		<p>Agree with #19 above.   US still needs a real double fence like the one built in SanDiego.  It stopped masses of immigrants - - they moved to AZ entries.  We know the real fence works, costs less and is needed ASAP.  It is revealing how phoney politicians will front money for phoney front groups to continue the money laundry they work within.  It is a disease that needs cured. V</p>

But don&rsquo;t lie to me and tell me you can&rsquo;t MAKE it work when we can zero in with a satellite on a car&rsquo;s license plate close enough to read the tag number while it&rsquo;s sitting in the driveway.</p>
