			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael B. Farrell, Christian Science Monitor, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a unique twist to the notion of using educational scholarships to improve minority representation, an Oregon civil rights group says it will offer a $2,000 scholarship to encourage white college students to pursue studies in race relations.</p>
<p>The initiative by the Oregon League of Minority Voters, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group based in Portland, Ore., may well be the first of its kind. College scholarships have long been seen as a vehicle  &mdash;  albeit a controversial one  &mdash;  for improving the condition of minorities, but this appears to be the first time that white students have been singled out for assistance in the name of promoting civil rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lack white participation in the racial conversation in this state, so we are trying to do something about it,&#8221; says Promise King, executive director of the Oregon group. &#8220;When we talk about race relations, most of the time in Oregon, most white people are not at the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus of his organization remains on empowering minorities, but the group also feels it&rsquo;s important to have non-minority allies in a state where about 90 percent of the population is white, Mr. King says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Historically, the civil rights movement has sought out white allies, says Kenneth Nunn, a law professor at the University of Florida who teaches a course in African-American history and the law. {snip}</p>
<p>One reason the Oregon group can undertake this initiative, he says, is because they are a private group. &#8220;When you are talking about public institutions, it&rsquo;s very difficult to do anything that is racially targeted,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><b>Minority programs disappearing</b></p>
<p>Over the past decade, colleges and universities have backed away from scholarships specifically aimed at minority students to avoid claims of discrimination or legal challenges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Professor Orfield sees a benefit in encouraging white students to pursue civil rights studies, he says that students from all racial and ethnic backgrounds are taking his classes at UCLA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Initiative criticized</b></p>
<p>Since King&rsquo;s group is not a public institution, it may not draw the same legal scrutiny as many universities did for singling out specific racial groups in admission or for scholarships in the name of affirmative action. Still, the effort is attracting some criticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise&rsquo;s group should not just focus on whites being good allies, but ensuring those people use their power and influence to give up their spot for a person of color,&#8221; Nichole Maher, executive director of the Native American Youth and Family Center told The Oregonian. &#8220;The most courageous thing a white ally can do is truly share power.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is good. Sets the example. Rewards whites for studying race relations. Race relations are a good subject for whites to study. Race relations are afrovoodoos complaining about oppression and whites admitting unearned privilege.</p>
<p>Some white students of race relations will wake up and realize that relating to afrovoodoos means white dispossession, their white dispossession. Having been surrounded by authentic and complaining afrovoodoos in race relations classes, these whites will decide that being on the losing end of that racial bargain has no merit or virtue. The opposing tribe offers nothing in return, only institutionalized thug tyranny. </p>
<p>When will we see on YouTube the clip of white Heidi B., white Abe F., and white Chris M. admitting their unearned white privileges to black Jesse J., black Al S., and black Michelle O.?</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing to gain from being surrounded by the Diversities, only loss for us. Nonetheless, admitting white privilege offers a certain good when white liberals do it. Thereby, they must get an up close and personal look, and whiff, of those afrovoodoos who are demanding the whites&rsquo; admissions. Poetic justice for us appears when the afrovoodoos who receive the admissions then insist that the groveling whites prove they mean it by giving something up, like white paid jobs and white fertile daughters. </p>
<p>Some of these scholarship whites will come over to our side, much like the young, eager, do gooding white nursing students who go to work in majority afrovoodoo urban hospitals and eventually admit, &#8220;Before I went to work there, I wasn&rsquo;t a racist.&#8221;<br>

		<p>White students have been forced to study race relations for the past twenty some odd years, mostly at the expense of more substantive fields of study through diversity and multicultural credit requirements and multicultural drivel polluting traditional fields of study.</p>

<p>Well, why not also offer scholarships for whites who want PhDs in advanced &ldquo;race relations.&rdquo; I think a top 10 list of areas of course &ldquo;specializations&rdquo; is in order here:</p>
<p>1.) Hating your whiteness, teaching how Marxism might allow you blackness;</p>
<p>2.) Transformative slavery atoning, teaching how to make manageable white taxpayers;</p>
<p>3.) Positive MLK revisionism, making a Marxist a martyred multicultural monolith;</p>
<p>4.) The Feminist perspective on interracial nonwhite rape of white women, just enjoy it oppressive white princesses and Barbie dolls;</p>
<p>5.) Enjoying multicultural criminal justice in America, it&rsquo;s your turn in cellblock 8 Prince Ken;</p>
<p>6.) The anthropology and sociology of mixed race reproduction, psychologically titillating in an &ldquo;open-minded&rdquo; and &ldquo;humane&rdquo; sexuality;</p>
<p>7.) Diversity as strength studies, deciphering how to make the obviously foolish insightful and appealing;</p>
<p>8.) The foot in the face studies, Orwell was right if you are white and accepting it as redemption;</p>
<p>9.) Critical thinking, another white fallacy designed to oppress nonwhites and extend unearned privileges;</p>
<p>10.) And, advanced insanity as sanity, being wretchedly crazed never felt so rapturously tolerant.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>As a white man, I&rsquo;d be told &#8216;no&rsquo; if I walked into any corporate or government office and asked the CEO or director to &#8220;share power&#8221;. <br>
They&rsquo;re asking for unearned access to the levers of power that most whites are denied. </p>
<p>In typical fashion, they will expect the Obama presidency to be followed by another non-white in the highest office.  The word &#8216;share&rsquo; to them means to own in perpetuity.</p>

		<p>I was under the impression that even this generation went to college to get a degree to land a good job.  Pursuing studies in race relations is about as worthless as a major in black history.  Actually, it&rsquo;s more worthless because at least a black can get a government job with his nothing degree through affirmative action and quotas.  </p>

<p>Great. People of color get to focus their scholarship on how much they hate whites, in an eloquent way of course, and whites get to do the same but about how much they hate themselves or more likely other white folks.</p>

<p><br>
Nailed it!  In 1984, they tortured Winston Smith until he LOVED them. The more miserable our lives become because of Diversity, the more we will love it, because we deserve the misery because we first made them miserable. Not helping them get home to Africa upon the ratification of the 13th Amendment made them most miserable of all, so they take it out on us through robbing, raping, and murdering.<br>
 </p>
<p>As long as whites think they deserve dispossession, they will consider it a good thing and redemptive. The big lie is that the liberal white elites who force it on us, such as the teachers, professors, think tankers, social activists, evangelical Christians, and big money grantees, won&rsquo;t actually allow themselves to be dispossessed. What white in the media has volunteered for Diversity Czar Mark Lloyd&rsquo;s opinion that powerful whites in the media must step down?  Why are white Chris M. and white Keith O. still on TV? Don&rsquo;t they know that the Diversity demands that they surrender their jobs? They do know it, but they refuse to budge. Can&rsquo;t we call them racists for being white and keeping the job for themselves when they know a more deserving minority wants it? </p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the Diversity&rsquo;s giving a good old Orwellian kick in the face to Chris and Keith bring feelings of redemption?<br>

		<p>If they want some one white at the table for an honest conversation about race relations, perhaps they could invite Jared Taylor. Of course, they want a white person who will play the role of human pin cushion. And they sit there and wonder why no white people show up.</p>

<p><br>
Well then, doesn&rsquo;t that make the &#8220;conversation&#8221; something more like a one-way rant?! Seems to be the case, and not just in Oregon.</p>
<p>Last year I attended a one-day Diversity Conference at my Alma Mater, out of sheer curiousity. Lots and lots of blacks and Latinos, very few whites or Asians. A lot of discussion about how to get them to do what normal people do naturally. The solution, of course, is to force them into the company of the higher achievers so that some of the good habits will rub off.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of pointing out the more likely result, painfully evident, that the mixing brings down the norm rather than raises it. Even some of the empirical studies cited at the conference supported that point of view, but uttering it in so many words was not allowed.</p>

<p>First we need to distinguish who is White? White skin does not make one &#8220;White&#8221;. There are many &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; who have White skin but are not of the White race. There are many Arabs/Orientals with White skin, but are not of the White race. There are many &#8220;Whites&#8221; who have White skin but are not of the White race.</p>

		<p>Wow!  I&rsquo;d love to do this and pretend that I&rsquo;ve sipped from the kool-aid sporting the wild eyed blank look of having been indoctrinated.  Then in a calculated plan, slowly start to turn every argument around thus shining the light on these race hustlers.  It would have to be done with more than one person in on the evil plan but it would be a hoot!  Imagine the converations about black crime and showing those pesky FBI statistics and break downs by city and state, rates of reincarceration, etc.  Imagine challenging all those warped theories with proven facts.  It would be a complete ball of fun.</p>

		<p>As a former Oregonian (I was raised in West Linn, which is still overwhelmingly White), I would suggest that the best &#8220;study&#8221; in race relations that an OR resident could receive is precisely the one I did.</p>
<p>I moved to Houston twenty years ago. My racial awakening - more an epiphany - came quite soon thereafter.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of OR, no nonwhite ethnicity has reached the critical mass necessary for their - forgive me - &#8220;true colors&#8221; to have shown. As an innocent and naive teenager, I wondered, through little fault of my own (I was fourteen when the family moved to TX) what the &#8220;big deal&#8221; was. I had, after all, been taught the lie that race was naught but differing skin color, and worse, had seen it with my own eyes&hellip;</p>
<p>In a town 99% white. </p>
<p>Moving to TX cured me, but in the Internet age, I&rsquo;m not so sure states with insignificant nonwhite populations have even Gunnar Myrdal&rsquo;s excuse for their ignorance. </p>

<p>This is where I draw the line.  What refining definition comes next, and according to whom?  Will it be a religious definition?  Somehow, I think so.  And when we go down that road and go after the white Jews, next it will be white Catholics, then the Orthodox Christians, then the Baptists against the Lutherans, or Episcopals.  No.  For me, it is a matter of genetics, and if some relgious white attempts to manipulate from there, they will find many difficult issues to resolve.  So many, that the political energy of such an attempt would desolve.</p>
<p>For me, white is as white looks, and white is as white does.  I cannot see a more practical way to avoid a self-defeating scenario as #17 Anonymous unwittingly proposes.  I would be willing to bet that if #17 Anonymous and most regular posters had a dna study done, they would find markers that would compromise their self image as a &#8220;pure white.&#8221;<br>

<p>We need to promote the white race rather than trying to drag the other guy down. When you think about it, though, isn&rsquo;t that what the other activists try and do?</p>
<p>I guess whites are always held to a higher standard. Or at least held to some standard at all. </p>

<p>A good point YJ; however, some &ldquo;whites&rdquo; feel entitled to only do the face stomping or kicking and never be on the receiving end of it. Reds like Chris the Tingler and Keith the Oddity, feel that since they are so &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive,&rdquo; they are immune to such treatment. They see themselves as doing &ldquo;so much good&rdquo; in terms of degrading and hating their own race, that they feel they are owed a pass.</p>
<p>Also, since they are rich Reds in this multicultural Oceania of ours, they feel that gives them &ldquo;Inner Party&rdquo; status just like O&rsquo;Brien in 1984.</p>
<p>All the best to you YJ,</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s put our cards on the table. No White kid needs to be subjected to this pile of horse dung, since they are living it in their Public Schools, and Colleges, and they are watching their fathers being discriminated against, in all fields of work, hirings, and promotions, especially in the Civil Service sector; where they would rather hire a complete Black Moron, over an extremely qualified White male.</p>
<p>No, what we need are White owned Companies putting Scholorship money up for White children only, in order to go to College and maybe become a Scientist, Engineer, or Medical Doctor. We need these children to grow up, and strengthen our Communities, and Country. </p>
<p>I was enraged when I read about Bill Gates Scholorships for all children, except White children. Maybe someone should tell Gates who actually buys most of his software products, and who actually works for him as Computer Programers, and Software Engineers. And Bill should take another look in the mirror, too.</p>
