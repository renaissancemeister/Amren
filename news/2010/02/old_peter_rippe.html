			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agustin C. Torres, Jersey Journal, February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is about Peter Stuyvesant and Jersey City  &mdash;  specifically when the city was born. Stuyvesant, governor of what would eventually become New York, was himself a political figure and now finds himself in the middle of a modern debate. Should he give way to more recent historic figures who resonate more with the present population?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, without any warning, workmen removed the bronze Stuyvesant statue from its place in front of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School (School 11), put it on the back of a truck and drove off. The stone-etched words on the statue were cut out and the afternoon was spent jackhammering the base.</p>
<p>The surprise attack took local historians and conservancy people off guard, and they spent the afternoon calling each other.</p>
<p>Unless a ransom note arrives, the consensus was that the order to remove the likeness of the great director-general of the New Netherlands colonies of the Dutch West Indies Company came from city Superintendent of Schools Charles T. Epps. Epps could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the plan is for a statue of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to replace Stuyvesant in front of School 11, according to local merchants and history buffs. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is some irony to all this.</p>
<p>In a New Jersey City University Web site, it is claimed the city has &#8220;the oldest continuous educational institution in the United States&#8221; dating back to the Dutch colony in the 1600s, when Bergen&rsquo;s school house was overseen by elders of the Dutch Reformed Church. Public education was free and funded by  &mdash;  yup, property taxes. You would think the Board of Education would be glad to have Peter&rsquo;s statue in place.</p>

		<p>This should set off alarm bells.  It is exactly what new regimes always do in order to consolidate their grip on a society.  That&rsquo;s &#8220;consolidate&#8221;, as in AFTER having taken power. </p>
<p>My first impulse was to cringe at the apparently totalitarian aspect, but it doesn&rsquo;t really apply.  The fact is that no matter what style of society or governance a people create, when they take a country from another people and replace them, they also replace the icons of the conquered people with those of their own heroes, especially those who played a key role in the conquering.</p>
<p>This should be a very alarming wake-up call indeed.  It is (yet more) evidence of just how late the hour is for our people.   We have already lost control of our own country, and our culture is being dismantled and destroyed before our very eyes. </p>

		<p>In the Soviet Union every city had a statue of Lenin just as every city in the United States now has some monument/memorial of MLK. The intent of both is the same: to pervert the history/culture of the nation into the image of the Bolshevik elites. Every statue, park, school, garden, museum, etc, that honors a civil rights leader screams out the same thing: &#8220;this is not your country anymore, whitey! It&rsquo;s ours because we have rewritten your history and we control the public discourse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>  My earliest ancestors here, in what became the United States, settled in New Amsterdam in 1662!  Peter Stuyvesant governed then.  Now supposedly it is &#8220;settled.&#8221;  MLK Jr. was the forerunner of sorts, a negative &#8220;John the Baptist,&#8221; if you will of so much anti-white animus! It is anyone&rsquo;s guess who may be the &#8220;Chosen One.&#8221; Or is it?  I suppose the only history that is allowed to be erased is white history.  :(  I have lived too long. :( </p>

		<p>Actually, I would agree that Peter Stuyvesant should get the old heave-ho in favor of a figure more representative of the present population of the area.</p>
<p>I would nominate Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, a fine current example of a black African destroying a nation created by whites.<br>
After all, this is what they do, and they appear proud of it.</p>
<p>Mugabe and those like him, when present in sufficient numbers, have left their mark on every town, state, country, and continent created and developed by whites, reducing it to the African norm of barbarism.</p>
<p>So out with that bum Stuyvesant! After all, what&rsquo;s he done for us lately?</p>

		<p>This makes perfect sense.  The new owners are redecorating.  As whites we probably feel that the newbies could have at least offered us the statue and allowed us to move it to a new location.  That would have been the civilized thing to do.  Our new masters, however, are not civilized.  They want to extract revenge for all slights, real and immagined.  And our leaders agree with this revenge.  At some point, like Germany and Japan, we must admit defeat and hope to salvage some aspect of our culture.</p>

		<p>This is just another example of how our history is stolen from us as we are replaced by people who do not share our race or our heritage.  We&rsquo;re supposed to celebrate this.  I&rsquo;m no expert on this matter, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that that was the only statue of Peter Stuyvesant in the entire country.  We have plenty of statues and photos of plagiarist Martin Luther King.  But black children in Jersey City are not to be told that a white man ever did anything worthwhile.</p>

What happen to the bronze, bronze has a big salvage value?  Not only did they jack hammer the stone pedistal but had to make sure the words were removed.  The Nazis and Russians did this when they took over.  Jersey City is a place no one goes to unless they absolutly  have to go.  Its a BLACK enclave.</p>

		<p>While this has not happened here yet, in terms of removing statues, public schools have simply been renamed by placing new signs over the original inscriptions. This typically occurs when a historical footnote is elevated in status to placate residents of a minority neighborhood, most of whom have no sense of history whatsoever, that formerly had a European population. In one public park, Puerto Rican gangbangers used to routinely vandalize a statute to demonstrate that their neighborhood was no longer a Polish enclave. Nobody bothered to tell them that the naturalist, Alexander Von Humboldt, for whom the park was named and the statute dedicated, was not of Polish origin. </p>

		<p>Few today know of the free English town of Gravesend, founded in then-wild Brooklyn by the Anabaptist widow Lady Deborah Moody, with the blessing of Stuyvesant&rsquo;s predecessor Willem Kieft.    Gravesend was the second place in the world, after Roger Williams&rsquo;s Rhode Island, to permit its residents complete freedom of conscience in religious matters.</p>
<p>Stuyvesant took over New Netherland shortly thereafter.  He and, even more so, Kieft have a reputation for being tyrants.  But they pretty much left Gravesend alone for two decades, until the English took over.  </p>
<p>In short, they showed a lot more true tolerance than the beneficiaries of today&rsquo;s &#8220;civil rights&#8221; establishment!</p>

Truer words were never written. As a Southerner and a member of a Confederate heritage organization, I am well aware of the underlying resentment that White residents surely must feel at yet another erasure of our history, but unlike Southerners, the northern population can only look squarely in the mirror to see where the blame/fault lies in our displacement. The north did indeed create the beast that is now destroying the Last Great Hope of Mankind. They are now sowing what they&rsquo;ve reaped, and what they&rsquo;ve forced *us* to swallow for fifty years.</p>

<p>The TALIBAN has also done such destruction here in Afghanistan. The Kuwaitis have rewritten their history with no mention of EVER having been part of Iraq!  in fact, they say that Kuwait has been a nation ruled by the Sabah family for more than 400 years!Most of us here know the true story though, as do the Kuwaitis.</p>

I really don&rsquo;t see what the problem is.  European Americans (i.e., &#8220;whites&#8221;) willingly, if not enthusiastically, have turned 30+ millions of their progeny into medical waste; consciously made the collective decision to reduce their fertility rate to well below replacement level to &#8220;self-actualize&#8221;; promoted in law and culture the equivalency of homosexuality to one of simply moral equivalency and &#8220;choice&#8221;; opened their physical borders to essentially unlimited legal and illegal immigration of the world&rsquo;s most undesirable hominids (20+ million and counting); given full citizenship and legal rights to the progeny of these immigrants upon birth; willingly and mercilessly taxed themselves to support other races, cultures, and ethnicities while ignoring the financial needs and futures of their own childre; willingly disgarded their Christian faith and replaced it with the religions of &#8220;diversity and &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, and willingly dropped in the memory hole the historical basis of their civilizational roots. Are we to complain that our chosen replacements wish to promote and honor their own races, cultures and ethnicities?  Of course not.  The honorable choice is to accept our own responsibility in the holocaust that is to evelope us and either resist or go quietly into the night.  It is dishonorable to whine.</p>

		<p>Looks like they&rsquo;re moving it about 1000 feet to a more prominent location. You could argue that they&rsquo;d be better off leaving the statue where it is, but this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a case of dropping Old Pete down the memory hole. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if the school board axed the citizens before having the statue of Peter Stuyvesant chopped down and taken away.  Or did the students axe anyone about it.  I think everyone involved, citizens, students, board members should all have been axed their opinion.  Now the upside is that by having a statue of the sainted Martin Luther King in place of the old white man, Peter Stuyvesant, it will encourage those students to really work hard in their studies.  Just you wait and see, all you unbelievers, just watch those test scores in mathc, and science shoot off the charts!</p>

<p>This helps our cause when we can point out to the naysayer whites that they do plan to replace you, your children, way of life and values of western society with their ideals. </p>
<p>They are not white people in black skin. The differences are real culturally, genetically,different ideas of fairness, right and wrong.

		<p>Hopefully, this statue has been placed in a more appropriate and dignified place.  Even salvaged Nazi art was not thrown onto the ash heap of history (the Germans put it into storage), and the U.S. didn&rsquo;t rip down all statues of Confederate dignitaries after the war.  Yet, in the Congo, statues of Livingston and King Leopold were plopped into a so-called junk yard (indistinguishable from the countryside in general, I&rsquo;ll bet).  Livingston lies across an abandoned, rusted railroad track  &mdash;  a fitting image of the New Africa.</p>

<p>How many young blacks really even know or care about Martin Luther King?  Perhaps a more relevant culture hero - Flava-Flav for example, or Snoop-Dogg - should be honored in front of the school.  They seem much more representative of modern american black culture.</p>
<p>As to King, he is nothing to me.  I would not waste a minute of my life &#8220;honoring&#8221; him.  He is a prophet with feet of clay, and not even my prophet, but rather that of an alien and hostile people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;that which is black must remain black. That which is white must be made black&rsquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>How about? &#8216;That which is black must remain strong and black, and be celebrated. That which is white must be made black, after first being condemned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Is the word &#8216;strong&rsquo; just a bit much?</p>

		<p>Is the Stuyvesant the same for whom the Bedford-Stuyvesant housing projects in New York City are named?  If so, then Peter Stuyvesant has plenty of relevance to blacks, because the Bed-Stuys and the Cabrini-Green complex in Chicago were always competing with each other for the position of worst high rise public housing ghetto in America.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Kuwaitis have rewritten their history with no mention of EVER having been part of Iraq! in fact, they say that Kuwait has been a nation ruled by the Sabah family for more than 400 years!  Most of us here know the true story, as do the Kuwaitis.&#8221;<br>

Interesting!   I wonder if it&rsquo;s legal (safe) to discuss it there?</p>

		<p>There was a similar situation in San Jose, California, a few years ago.  A statue of Thomas Fallon, an early mayor of San Jose and first person to raise the American flag in California, was found &#8220;offensive&#8221; by Chicanos  (probably none of whose ancestors were in California at the time). The statue was intended for City Park Plaza, at the site of the flag raising (now re-named Plaza de César Chávez). San Jose, as presently populated and California&rsquo;s third largest city, seems lost to whites. </p>
<p>Ironically, Fallon was much less prejudiced than the modern Hispanics who resent him as a symbol of Gringo imperialism. He made a fortune in the Gold Rush, settled down and married Carmelita Castro, daughter of a local rancher with whom he had a large family. He would probably be mystified by their hostility. </p>

		<p>Southern Belle: &#8220;As a Southerner and a member of a Confederate heritage organization, I am well aware of the underlying resentment that White residents surely must feel at yet another erasure of our history, but unlike Southerners, the northern population can only look squarely in the mirror to see where the blame/fault lies in our displacement. The north did indeed create the beast that is now destroying the Last Great Hope of Mankind. They are now sowing what they&rsquo;ve reaped, and what they&rsquo;ve forced *us* to swallow for fifty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all due respect, Miss Belle, (and Anon. #28) there is no reason to divide our cause by insulting Northerners.  Sure, much of the White racial awareness that exists in today&rsquo;s America is to be found in the South, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Northerners are all bad.  It&rsquo;s mostly a lack of exposure.  As a proud Northerner myself, I find it a little bit insulting to hear things like we &#8220;created the beast that is destroying..Mankind&#8221;.  Perhaps this is what that British fellow Derbyshire was talking about when he said AmRen has a Southern &#8220;thing&#8221;.</p>

<p>I understand you. I am a Northerner too. But is it not true? It was busybody abolitionists in New England who started it all. The &#8220;monster&#8221; certainly did not come from out of the South.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s lack of exposure, above all. Easier to love and commiserate with those who are far away and can be idealized. The farther the better. </p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if laws against slavery in northern states did not amount, in effect,  to laws against blacks. After all, the two (blacks and slavery) were easily conflated at a time when one virtually meant the other. By passing laws against slavery (and seeming highly virtuous) it was eqivalent to passing a law against the presence of blacks (which would have made them feel guilty and racist).  I understand that Indiana, for instance, very nearly passed a law against blacks being allowed to reside in the state. But a law against slavery had very nearly the same effect, and looked much better.</p>

I agree. A law against &#8220;slavery&#8221; made them look virtuous and humanitarian, but its effect (during the time of slavery) was to keep blacks out of the state.  The blacks were someone else&rsquo;s problem to deal with.  Very clever hypocrisy, that!</p>

<p>Check out the circa 1950 postcard of Bergen Square in Jersey city.</p>
<p>Wonder what it looks like now.</p>
<p>Those websites with old postcards of American cities are cool</p>

		<p>This is the same thing that the Communists did in the Soviet Union, and China. So, why are people so surprised?</p>
<p>I see alot written,here,about White people needing to wake up, but I see no concrete action by any large group of Whites, anywhere in the Country. Without large Street Protests to make ourselves heard, you can forget everything else. </p>
<p>Also, I read a story, which I heard about through another site, which was on the Council of Conservative Citizens web site. Two armed Blacks found four White kids in an abandoned house, and raped them. This took place in Florida. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny that this has not been Headline News, around the Country, non-stop, as it was for the Duke Rape case lie, and for Don Imus&rsquo; joke about, &#8220;Nappy Headed Hoes&#8221;? I guess you have to have a certain criteria, before it becomes a priority for the Media to report atrocities like this. </p>
