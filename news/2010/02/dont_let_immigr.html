			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David R. Francis, Christian Monitor, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 15 million Americans are unemployed. Yet Washington allows businesses to bring in about 1 million foreigners a year to take supposedly short-term jobs that many jobless would leap at taking if they could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; situation, says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a Washington think tank that generally urges a lower level of immigration into the United States.</p>
<p>This year, the H-2B program alone will let more than 100,000 lower-skilled foreign workers come to the US as &#8220;temporary, seasonal, nonagricultural guest workers.&#8221; Businesses like the program because the foreigners, who need the jobs in order to stay in the US, &#8220;shut up and do what they are told,&#8221; says Mr. Krikorian.</p>
<p>But H-2B operates under a flawed assumption, says David Seminara, a former US Foreign Service officer and author of a CIS study on the program. The flawed assumption is that &#8220;Americans don&rsquo;t want to mow your lawn. They don&rsquo;t want to serve you your lobster roll sandwich during your summer holiday in Maine. They won&rsquo;t drive the trucks that bring food to the grocery store.&#8221; In fact, many Americans would welcome such jobs.</p>
<p>President Obama, as a candidate, promised to push for &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; reform of immigration law, probably including amnesty for some of the perhaps 11 million illegal immigrants plus a boost in legal immigration.</p>
<p>With the GOP&rsquo;s victory in the US Senate race in Massachusetts Jan. 19, the chances of Congress tackling such a politically risky broad bill before the fall elections are about zero, Krikorian figures. One bill that might have a chance of passage is the DREAM legislation (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act), which gives amnesty to illegal immigrants&rsquo; illegal children if they have graduated from high school in the US.</p>
<p>US immigration policy is extremely controversial because of the clash of business, labor, and humanitarian interests.</p>

		<p>Any bill that offers amnesty to illegals who graduate from high school will only ensure that a high school diploma will mean even less than it does now.  Teachers that insist on students actually passing their classes will have their grades revised by their principals, and probably get a beating in the bargain.  </p>

<p>Translation: &#8220;Americans don&rsquo;t want to mow your lawn for minimum wage with no benefits. They don&rsquo;t want to serve you your lobster roll sandwich during your summer holiday in Maine for minimum wage with no benefits. They won&rsquo;t drive the trucks that bring food to the grocery store for minimum wage with no benefits. We must glut the labor market with cheap foreign labor to sap their bargaining power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Simon Jester, in about five years, the American by then much lower standard of living will see a glut of white employees who will take such jobs and be happy for it.  I believe the decision was made many years ago to do away with much of the middle class in favor of a large ignorant, poor, mixed race lower class.  The dumbing down process has been going on for some time now and is going full steam.  The U.S. government is dysfunctional, no matter which party heads it.  China is beginning to threaten economic sanctions on the U.S. when we displease them.  America is no longer a Superpower.  It really hasn&rsquo;t been for some time.  We will not be able to wage any wars anywhere when China decides to rein us in.  When this realization hits the public consciousness, it will be too late to do anything about it.  It is very interesting to watch all this happening.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re saying that a terrorist attack in the next two, to three months is inevitable.  Are they trying to manipulate us, or protect us?  No one knows.  The situation has INSTABILITY written all over it.</p>
<p>Better get ready.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the saying: You can pay for it through the front or pay for it through the back</p>
<p>We can pay more money for our groceries -&gt; so farm owners can pay higher wages that Americans will actually take<br>
or&hellip;<br>
We can get cheaper groceries -&gt; so the jobs go to illegals -&gt; so Americans can become unemployed -&gt; so we can all pay more taxes in unemployment benefits, welfare, prison, homeless shelters, *insert various social problems that result from people not having jobs*</p>
<p>Whenever an open-border ideologist says we need illegals to do the work ask him this question.<br>
&#8220;How do you want to pay for it: The front or The back?&#8221;</p>

		<p>historically, the left, the labor movement, protected American workers by among other things keeping the national borders closed to low-wage immigrants.</p>
<p>now the politically correct left wing position is open borders and mass immigration, which is exactly what the corporations want.</p>
<p>both major political parties are serving corporations and betraying American workers.</p>
<p>what is needed therefore it is a new labor movement which fights both open borders and job offshoring.</p>
<p>most American workers know this already, but there is no political parties represent their views.</p>

		<p>The fact is, unemployment in the USA is so high now (yes, it&rsquo;s in the 20%&rsquo;s, not the 10%&rsquo;s, because the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t is not telling the whole truth about it, as usual.)  We are in a DEPRESSION, not a recession, and it&rsquo;s going to get worse.  Therefore we have NO BUSINESS bringing in unskilled foreign workers to do ANYTHING, because out of work legal Americans can and will take every last job available, no matter how humble.  Keep the foreigners out and give legal Americans the jobs!!!</p>

		<p>#4 above is correct.</p>
<p>Why should anyone work for $7.25/hr, the current minimum wage when they can collect $280 / week unemployment?</p>
<p>Why should anyone work for $7.25/hr, the current minimum wage when they can collect upwards of $1500 / month on disability.</p>
<p>Why should anyone work for $7.25/hr, the current minimum wage when you are making over $100,000 / year?  usw&hellip;</p>
<p>In the last five years I have interviewed fifty job applicants that just happened to stop by or actually responded to an add I placed.  Perhaps fifteen were white, the rest mexican.</p>
<p>I am really sorry to inform you guys but I can find very few whites that will actually work for any amount of money.</p>
<p>The ability to get welfare, unemployment, disability and who knows what else combined with a very poor work ethic has really put us in bad shape.</p>
<p>I am as sincere in my willingness for an American Renaissance as the next white man and I have to state that we are making a big mistake by pointing out the failures of the blacks and mexicans and comparing their accomplishments to ours.  In reference to the chaos in Haiti&hellip; their barbarism in nothing compared to the French on the French in 1792, or the Americans on the Americans in 1860, or the Russians and Jews in 1917, or the white race insanity of WWI and WWII&hellip; </p>
<p>Going further&hellip; have any of you guys been sued?  The noble white lawyers and principled white judges, and incorruptible court reporters will gladly kill your aged parents, and bleed you and your surviving family unto death.  If you have any money at all the case will never end.  </p>
<p>If we are going to get our country back we are going to have to focus on our real problems, our short comings, our own traitors.</p>
