			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, January 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two men have lost their appeals against the UK&rsquo;s first conviction for inciting racial hatred via a foreign website.</p>
<p>Simon Sheppard, 51, was sentenced to four years and 10 months, and Stephen Whittle, 42, to two years and four months at Leeds Crown Court in July.</p>
<p>However, the Court of Appeal has reduced Sheppard&rsquo;s sentence by one year and Whittle&rsquo;s jail term by six months.</p>
<p>Sheppard, from Selby, North Yorks, and Whittle, of Preston, Lancs, controlled US websites featuring racist material.</p>
<p>During their first trial in 2008, they skipped bail and fled to California, where they sought asylum claiming they were being persecuted for their right-wing views, but were deported.</p>
<p>The police investigation began after a complaint about a leaflet called &#8220;Tales of the Holohoax&#8221;, which was pushed through the door of a Blackpool synagogue and traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Abusive and insulting&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Published material found later included images of murdered Jews alongside cartoons and articles ridiculing ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The pair were charged under the Public Order Act with publishing racially inflammatory material, distributing racially inflammatory material and possessing racially inflammatory material with a view to distribution.</p>
<p>Sheppard, of Brook Street, Selby, was found guilty of 16 offences and Whittle, of Avenham Lane, Preston, was found guilty of five.</p>
<p>Sentencing them, Judge Rodney Grant said he had rarely seen material which was so abusive and insulting.</p>
<p>Sheppard&rsquo;s counsel Adrian Davies told the Appeal Court the sites were &#8220;entirely lawful&#8221; in the US.</p>
<p>He said that there was no evidence that anyone in England and Wales  &mdash;  except for the police officer in the case  &mdash;  had ever seen any of them.</p>
<p><b>Excessive sentences</b></p>
<p>Giving the Court of Appeal ruling, Lord Justice Scott Baker said the material had been available to the public despite the fact that the evidence went no further than establishing that one police officer downloaded it.</p>
<p>He said the trial judge had been right to hold that he had jurisdiction to try the pair because much of the activities constituting the crime took place in England.</p>
<p>However, although the Appeal Court judges agreed that &#8220;this was truly pernicious material&#8221;, the sentences handed down had been excessive.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the very definition of hatred, an examination of the enemies evil and inhumanity? These &#8216;peace studies&rsquo; academics are making the defamation of whites into a kind of law. Not disparaging them in the proper way, or enthusiastically enough, considered &#8216;hatred&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt that at all. It sounds like a couple of bums getting off on annoying people. But 4 years and 2 years for publishing obscene material is still insane. That really does smack of political persecution. And the idea that someone can be convicted of &#8220;crimes&#8221; that took place in another country and then be extradited to serve a draconian sentence should scare the h311 out of everyone regardless of who they are.</p>

<p>&#8220;The irony is that if Sheppard and Whittle had sought asylum in Russia or Serbia they would probably have received a sympathetic hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do you imagine that?  The Nazis exterminated millions of Russians in and out of concentration camps.  And Russia (as the USSR) lost 20 million in all fighting the Nazis.  Serbia has a long running hatred of Germany and especially Nazis.  Serbs were also murdered in great numbers in concentration camps.  Many thousands of Serbs died building the Ljubel tunnel, which joins modern day Slovenia to Austria.  There are remains of a concentration camp that had been built there for the purpose of contructing the tunnel.  In Yugoslavia, books have long existed detailing that particular concentration camp and the suffering endured during the tunnel&rsquo;s construction.  There is a very moving monument there today and lists of all the nations who had populations represented there with French and Serbs the highest number.</p>
<p>Just because Russia and Serbia are seen as nationalistic today doesnt&rsquo; meant that they would sympathize with such a huge waste of time and effort as in denying the holocaust.  For any whites at this stage in the game to think that holocaust denying will advance or solidify our cause is the epitome of backward thinking and logic.  Claiming to be well informed (and intelligent) and deserving of racial rights as whites is not bolstered one bit by denying such an obvious and prolifically factual historical event. </p>
<p>And to A. Windaus; What would the Pilgrims think of this?  Check your history books, the Pilgrims arrived in 1620.  You must be thinking of The Founding Fathers of the late 18th century.  Nearly all of whom were Diests and products of The Enlightenment.  It was they who believed in the right to free speech, not members of the Mass Bay Colony.  The Pilgrims were not particularly tolerant or broadminded people, regardless of the Thanksgiving mythologies.  </p>

<p>I do believe 20 million Russians died during WWII, I don&rsquo;t believe 20 million Russian soldiers died in WWII. Examine more closely the number listed &#8216;killed&rsquo; in Russian and China, and the number of soldier who died in combat in WWII is closer to 6 million. 400,000 of them Americans who died in Africa, Italy, France, German and all across the Pacific. There were 12 million American soldiers on active duty at the end of WWII.</p>
<p>In the tally you make, where is your concern for, say, the millions of German soldiers who were kept prisoner and died in Russia, 10 years after WWII ended!</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;m not a &#8216;holocaust&rsquo; denier. There have been books written by survivors dealing with how those in the camps who couldn&rsquo;t work were killed, exterminated. Their &#8216;defenders&rsquo; might say, this was only done to those who were going to die anyway, this was a matter of mercy, who can say? No one seems too concerned with what Nazi&rsquo;s might have to say. I&rsquo;m not particularly either. </p>
<p>I do wonder if concerns about the &#8216;holocaust&rsquo; blind us to other injustices - it could even create them - right under our very noses. </p>
<p>But I suppose even wondering that is covered under &#8216;hate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s the liberals who seem glad it happened. At times that could be an accurate characterization. </p>
<p>And again, is bringing it up itself hatred. Is that the intention?</p>
<p>I do agree with you, that discussing it does no favors for these &#8216;white consciousness&rsquo; groups (whatever their intentions). You did bring it up though. </p>

		<p>The figure of only six million soldiers KIA during World War Two Mathias stated is a gross underestimation.  Japan, for instance lost some 1.6 million KIA: 400,000 sailors, killed almost entirely by the US Navy, and about 400,000 soldiers to each of the US, China and British Commonwealth (Indian and Australian forces).  Japanese civilian deaths were some 900,000 to a combination of US bombings and end-of-war retaliation killings in Manchuria and North Korea.  The 900,000 figure may include the Japanese merchant sailors who suffered terrible losses to US submarines, though this may be included in their naval losses - I am unclear on this.</p>
<p>The Russians lost some 1.1 million soldiers killed at Stalingrad alone, and that battle was a victory for them (and of the prewar population of the city, not many could be found after the war&rsquo;s end).  Other losses in the battle were some 400,000 Germans (including over 100,000 POWs who died of typhus in Russian camps), 135,000 Italians and 300,000 or so Romanians.  This puts the combatant, non-civilian death toll for Stalingrad alone at close to two million, or a full third of the six million Mathias is claiming.  I don&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
