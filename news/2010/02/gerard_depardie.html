<h1><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article7026786.ece">Gérard Depardieu Sparks Racism Row Over Role As Mixed-Race Dumas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Bremner, Times of London, February 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A row over racism has soured the release of the latest film in which Gérard Depardieu takes on one of the giants of French history.</p>
<p>Black actors and campaigners are upset that the white film star was cast as Alexandre Dumas, a French national hero with mixed African blood.</p>
<p>The blond, blue-eyed Depardieu sports curly hair and darker skin to play the creator of The Three Musketeers in L&rsquo;Autre Dumas.</p>
<p>Dumas, the world&rsquo;s most-read French author and an exuberant, high-living celebrity, was the grandson of a former Haitian slave. His father, although a Napoleonic-era general, was referred to as a Caribbean &#8220;negro&#8221;.</p>
<p>In his lifetime the novelist was mocked for his African features and he called himself un nègre.</p>
<p>The film, which opened to acclaim last week, is a fictional story about Dumas&rsquo; relations in the mid-19th century with Auguste Maquet, the shy assistant who is credited with plotting and drafting much of the Count of Monte Cristo and the Three Musketeers trilogy.</p>
<p>Non-white celebrities, some Dumas experts and black organisations are angry because they say that the producers missed a chance to celebrate ethnic diversity in France and remind the world of the writer&rsquo;s origins. &#8220;There is a mechanism of permanent discrimination by silence,&#8221; Jacques Martial, a black actor, said.</p>
<p>Patrick Lozès, the president of the Council of Black Associations of France, said: &#8220;In 150 years time could the role of Barack Obama be played in a film by a white actor with a fuzzy wig? Can Martin Luther King be played by a white?&#8221;</p>
<p>In an online statement the council said that the casting of Depardieu was evidence of France&rsquo;s failure to promote non-white stars in its cinema and media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very few of our compatriots know that Alexandre Dumas was mixed race and considered to be a black in his lifetime,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The film commits a double sin in the eyes of the council because its plot discredits Dumas&rsquo; genius by depicting his white assistant as the true creator of his works. &#8220;Possibly for commercial reasons they are whitewashing Dumas in order to blacken him further,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>That argument is all the more piquant in French because nègre remains the standard word in the language for ghost writer, or literary collaborator. In the film Maquet is played by Benoît Poelvoorde, a Belgian star.</p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s makers said that Depardieu was the ideal match for the novelist, whose works have been turned into 200 films. Not only has the actor played many of Dumas&rsquo; heroes, but also his larger-than-life personality resembles that of the novelist. &#8220;The vividness of Depardieu is the perfect embodiment of Dumas,&#8221; Frank Le Wita, the producer, said. &#8220;The subject is not le nègre, but la nègritude [ghost writing] in literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Safy Nebbou, the director and of mixed race himself, noted that Dumas had been one-quarter black. &#8220;It would have been an historic error to have chosen a mixed-blood actor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had blue eyes like Depardieu.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Mr Nebbou, 41, conceded that &#8220;France is enormously behind the Anglo-Saxons in the matter of actors from other ethnic backgrounds&#8221;.</p>
<p>As well as stirring controversy over its casting the film is annoying Dumas fans with its promotion of the thesis that Maquet and Dumas&rsquo; other assistants should receive more credit for the adventures that have captivated so many readers.<br/>

		<p>Dumas was still mostly white.  I was more offended that the BBC but black actors in their King Arthur and Robin Hood series.  Sure, those are fictional tales but in the time they were set the idea of blacks in Britain is ludicrous.</p>

<p>No. But in many based on true events stories, such as those on Lifetime television, it&rsquo;s OK for a black person to be portrayed by a white actor any day. </p>

		<p>Dumas Pere, the general was  1/4 black. Dumas the son who wrote 3 Musketeers was 1/8 black.</p>
<p>Dumas the son ran a book factory, not printing, writing.  All his stories are based on historical materials from the French National Library. D&rsquo;Artagnan and his friends were real persons.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Artagnan was actually head of Louis 14th&rsquo;s secret service.  He specialized in disguising himself as a working woman.  He would infiltrate the enemy camp as a waitress or cleaning woman.</p>
<p>Dumas did not write the play Cyrano, but that too was based on 3 real people.  Cyrano, his cousin Madeline and her husband Christian. Most of the story really happened to them.</p>
<p>All of Dumas son&rsquo;s books were based on historical characters straight out of the National Library.  Researchers drafted the stories, ghost writers did the dialogue and finished it.  Some of the ghost writers specialized in story.  Others specialized in character.</p>
<p>Dumas signed his name to all the books.</p>
<p>This method was common in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  The writer Colette got her start as a ghostwriter for the books her husband signed his name as author to.  Churchill used the same methods Dumas did.  Rough draft by a researcher and then a team of ghostwriters.</p>
<p>As for Depardieu, he needs to retire.  He seems to be the only male actor the French have.  Time to give younger, slimmer and better looking actors a chance.</p>

		<p>If it is acceptable for a Black man to play the role of a Norse god (Heimdall in the upcoming &#8220;Thor&#8221; movie), then certainly it is acceptable for a White to portray Dumas.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t find the Dumas portrayal acceptable, I invite them to protest the Heimdall portrayal by a Black.  When they do, I will cheerfully join in the protest against Dumas being played by a White.</p>
<p>Sound fair?</p>

By many accounts Dumas&rsquo; grandmother was of French/Creole/black decent and in fact an octoroon (possibly a quintroon), making his father a quintroon, making Dumas, 1/32 black (and possibly 1/64 black).</p>
<p>Then again he may have been all White. His grandfather coming from Santo Domingo and not being a light skinned, blued eyed, lank haired blonde, would open many to the charge of being part black.<br/>
 <br/>
The very Aryan looking Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies and his enemies continuously made references to him being part black.</p>
<p>I personally am not a big fan of Dumas and although his adventure stories are interesting, I prefer, Jules Verne, Gustav Flaubert (Salambo), Jean Larteguy (The Centurions), Jean Raspail (Camp of the Saints) all great adventure writers.</p>

<p>I have read a few of his books, and to be honest, this is the very first time I&rsquo;ve ever heard about this!</p>
<p>I will check that out, though: we know how some liberals have a special way of rewriting history, in order to promote multiculturalism&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, when I read on the web that some US Black college professors teach their students that Africans invented rockets&hellip; I realized that one has to be selective, about information sources.</p>

		<p>It beggers believe that Blacks the world over continue making clowns of themselves by their idiotic assertions that anything mixed-race automatically spells &#8216;black&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Are they still so intellectually stunted even though they reside in the 21st century and unjustly benefit from unearned racial privileges and quotas at the expense of Whites everywhere due to their blackness?</p>
<p>Miscegenated people, in terms of race, are neither one or the other in entirety.  They belong to a separate genetic grouping.</p>

		<p>having watched an episode of the most recent Robin Hood and Arthurian offerings we were confronted by the impossibility of black actors.</p>
<p>Did we British make a fuss? No. We just switched off.</p>
<p>Had we British made a fuss we would have been branded &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time blacks learnt the old saying &#8220;Sauce for the goose&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At best Dumas had a very slight black ancestry. One more example of blacks co-opting the heritage of other peoples and their accomplishments (perhaps because they have so little of their own of which to boast of). Look how deluded blacks claim that the pyramids in ancient Egypt were built by blacks. Complete nonsense.</p>

		<p>Britain makes such wonderful historical dramas, but lately they&rsquo;re being terribly tarnished by multiethnic casting that ruins the reality of the films.  A prime example is the feature &#8220;Ruby in the Smoke&#8221;, a 19th-Century period piece, situated in England, in which two black men play characters that are treated exactly as if they were white.  One of these is David Harewood, who perfectly portrayed an African thug in &#8220;Blood Diamond&#8221;.  On reading about this very dark-skinned, hulking actor, I saw that he played Nelson Mandela in a recent flick!!  Now, this is beyond ridiculous.  And some complained that Jolie portrayed Danny Pearl&rsquo;s almost-white wife!</p>

<p>Whatever the breakdown, he was far more white than &#8220;black&#8221;.  And his success was given him by a white country.  What fame would he have had if he had written his novels in black Africa?</p>
<p>This is the very same as with Pushkin in Russia. We are told that he was &#8220;black&#8221;,  and he is lavishly praised as the father of Russian literature and even of the modern Russian language!  But in fact he was only partly African and one suspects that without that singular advantage promoting him, he would have been considered just another competent writer, of which Russia has produced so many.</p>

		<p>Which work of Shakespeare has the Moor?</p>
<p>The Moor usually is played by a black man. But the word Moor usually conotates a Muslim from Africa. NOT always a black man. A North African that could be very light skinned indeed.</p>
<p>There has even been controversy over having a whitey play the Moor during that work of Shakespeare, what is it called?</p>
<p>Miss Saigon has the Eurasian played almost always by an oriental. But a Eurasian could include too Yul Brynner. </p>
<p>These things get so complicated for some.</p>
<p>Othello. Thats it, Othello. The Moor. Must always be A BLACK MAN AS THAT TERM BLACK MAN IS UNDERSTOOD IN THE U.S. Of course. </p>
