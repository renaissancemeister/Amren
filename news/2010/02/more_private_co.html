<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Community college transfer students are no longer being courted only by the usual suspects. More private institutions, of every ilk, are aggressively recruiting students from two-year colleges, hoping to bolster and diversify their enrollments and capitalize on the belt-tightening of regional public universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see more and more privates getting out there and recruiting transfers, whereas there really weren&rsquo;t that many out there even just a few years ago,&#8221; says Brenda Doran, director of transfer admissions at Bryant University, a small, tuition-driven independent institution in Rhode Island that has traditionally relied on community college transfers to meet its enrollment goals. &#8220;As with any competition, you just have to be more aggressive than you were in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so long ago, Doran and her colleagues from Bryant were among only a handful of private institutions in the Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts area that actively recruited at local community colleges. Now, competition for these area students is coming not only from other small, tuition-driven private institutions  &mdash;  such as Salve Regina University, in Rhode Island, and Sage College of Albany, in New York  &mdash;  but from some of the sector&rsquo;s elites. Thus, while Bryant has long had an admissions staff position dedicated to the recruitment of community college students, institutions such as Amherst recently added such positions, thanks to grant funding from groups such as the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For well-endowed private institutions, such as the University of Southern California and New York University  &mdash;  both of which have ratcheted up community college recruitment recently  &mdash;  seeking qualified two-year transfer students improves their demographic mix.</p>
<p>&#8220;It helps the selective privates with their diversity, in terms of race and socioeconomic status,&#8221; says Josipa Roksa, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Curry School of Education who does some community college research. &#8220;To get students in certain income brackets, it matters. Oftentimes it&rsquo;s easier to recruit at community colleges than at challenged high schools. For those who value diversity, whether it&rsquo;s because of the [college] rankings or their mission, this is where you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>This push for diversity drives the recruitment of community college students at places like Southern California  &mdash;  where only 13% of undergraduates are Latino, compared to 48% of residents in its home city, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve been working hard to get minority students from the surrounding area,&#8221; says Tatiana Melguizo, professor at USC&rsquo;s Rossier School of Education. &#8220;If you look at the first-time freshman students we admit, they&rsquo;re not as diverse. Still, the university has alternative ways of accepting transfers to bring in the kind of diversity that they can&rsquo;t get up front. Community college transfers were the best deals. They&rsquo;re motivated, they&rsquo;re more likely to graduate, and they&rsquo;re relatively cheap&#8221; for the college to educate.</p>

		<p>The same students which schools like USC didn&rsquo;t want right out of high school, because they couldn&rsquo;t hack it academically, are students they now want two years later because they could hack it in junior college?  I just don&rsquo;t get it.  It&rsquo;s not like the junior and senior years of undergrad school are easier than freshman and sophomore years, and if they weren&rsquo;t good enough to be freshmen and sophomores at USC, what is it about the JC experience that tells them that they&rsquo;ll be good juniors and seniors at USC?</p>

		<p>In all fairness, some youngsters go to Community College for financial and family reasons.  Others may not be mature enough to be on their own in a University setting.  Some are bright but didn&rsquo;t work hard in High School and don&rsquo;t have the grades. They are not all dummies.  Community Colleges, if properly utilized, could be great in and of themselves or a stepping stone to further education.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, like four year colleges and universities, admission and graduation standards have been watered down to the point that community college can end up being the equivalent of junior high.  A Bachelor&rsquo;s degree is equivalent to a high school diploma.  I am shocked at the &#8220;college educated&#8221; young people my organization hires who are barely literate.  But when a nation stoops to remedial classes in college there is no place to go but down.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s gotten really hard to gain admission to good public or private schools if you are an above average white student.  Many of the displaced white students go to community colleges where the cost is a fraction of what a major college is.  Add into the fact that many times the general education portion of a 4 year degree is pretty much the same no matter where one goes.  </p>

<p>Are we to believe that White students are magically imbued with &#8216;enlightenment,&rsquo; simply by the mere presence of a minority?  The only people that benefit from the diversity initiatives are the minorities.   </p>

		<p>I transferred from a community college to a real college. I got all the pre-reqs like sociology, psychology, etc. at CC and transferred the credits over. Ended up costing me about $200 for 30 credit hours. Why waste thousands of dollars on those mickey mouse classes?</p>

		<p>I too, am a proud community college student, and I have no complaints about the quality of education  &mdash;  after about four weeks of class. Every fall it&rsquo;s the same story: the campus is flooded with blacks, hispanics, still-thinks-s/he&rsquo;s-in high-school loud mouth unruly types, and &#8220;special needs&#8221; students (who have no business being in a college at all, and would be be better served by a trade school,) and four weeks of classes later, they just disappear.</p>

		<p>If a transfer student comes into a four-year college with all of his &#8220;core requirements&#8221; met, and then spends the next two years taking classes which are generally undersubscribed, the cost to the four-year institution to educate that student is virtually nil.  </p>
<p>If 100 additional freshman are admitted, then four additional sections of English 101 will have to be offered, along with additional sections of Western Civilization, algebra, etc., but 100 additional juniors fan out across a wide range of courses, so no additional classes are generally necessary, so faculty and building costs do not rise.  </p>
<p>Also, the less prestigious colleges have a more attrition across four years than the Ivies.  It LOOKS better for a school to have a freshman class of 1000 and a graduating class of 800 than to have the graduating class shrivel down to nothing.  The less prestigious four-year colleges also have to deal with their own students transferring out to more prestigious schools.  </p>
<p>The money from the transfer students is almost PURE GRAVY.  The better schools used to be able to turn their noses up at transfer students, but with shrinking endowments, they now need to take a second look.</p>

		<p>In fairness, not all community colleges/students are worthless today, as so many were back when most of my idiotic high school cohorts attended.  I attended a high profile/high cost ivy league school, and you couldn&rsquo;t pay me to send my own children there to be brainwashed into liberal ideologues.  My oldest just enrolled in a local, highly-regarded community college to take his basic, requisite courses at very low cost, and will then transfer to a four-year institution to finish.  He&rsquo;s not going to college to get an education (he&rsquo;s already gotten one at home, in private schools, and in the National Guard), but because having a degree is now a prerequisite for any sort of decent job since high-school diplomas are utterly worthless.  Granted, many I saw registering wore headscarves and pushed kids in strollers and bantered in Arabic and ebonics; mixed among them (but certainly not taking remedial classes along with them) were others like my son - well able to go elsewhere but not willing to waste the time and money.</p>

		<p>USC is located in a black ghetto area - it was right in the middle of the Watts riots of 1965.  It&rsquo;s a terrible area - I wouldn&rsquo;t drive down there in daylight let alone at night.  So if they want to recruit all kinds of minorities - let&rsquo;em   &mdash;   they should be right at home in that area.  UCLA, on the other hand, is located in beautiful Westwood, on the the west side of LA - near Brentwood, Beverly Hills, Bel-Aire, all the super upper class neighborhoods.  It&rsquo;s a state school - but I would never allow a child of mine to go to SC, while I&rsquo;d be delighted if they got into UCLA.  Ah, the little ironies of life&hellip;.</p>

		<p>7 AngloKraut: &#8220;Special needs&#8221; students don&rsquo;t belong in vocational schools.  My community college charged a pretty high materials fee when I started school, but halfway through my course of study, somebody decided it was discriminatory and they dropped the fees.  The cost had apparently been dissuading a lot of mediocre people from learning a trade, because a flood of dullards and slackers (all White) came into the shop classes, badly disrupting what had been a serious program.  It takes a decent mind to master techniques and materials, and to work independently.  Go learn a trade yourself, and see how you like working around dummies and shirkers. <br>

		<p>Many White children with high GPAs are locked out of prestigious colleges in their freshman year because of Affirmative Action racial quotas.  Then they lose heart and end up going to a less prestigious college that they graduate from. Or they transfer over, losing many credit hours in the process.</p>
<p>The universities are aware of the Freshman quotas so they are cooperating with Community Colleges and letting them know what transfer credits they will accept in advance.  Another thing that Community Colleges do is work with high schools so that high school students can take dual credits.  That means they already graduate from high school with some college credits under their belt.  </p>
<p>The point is the your child can get anywhere from 66 to 99 transferable hours out of the way for far less money than it would cost them if they started out at Big Hairy Deal University in their Freshman year.  Community Colleges are a real bargain and many regular University students take summer college hours to save on some money.  </p>
<p>For the money you save getting those core classes out of the way at the Community College, you could afford to send your child through the Masters program after they graduate from college.</p>
<p>In any case, your child&rsquo;s college diploma isn&rsquo;t going to show that s/he spent their freshman and sophomore years getting their core credit classes out of the way.  All it is going to show is that s/he graduated from Big Hairy Deal University.  </p>
<p>I know it can be rather disappointing that your child isn&rsquo;t getting the full college treatment out of the gate, when they graduate from high school, but is that such a bad thing when you look at some of the professors teaching these classes?  Your child will be two years older and they can mature a lot during that time.  </p>

		<p>Question Diversity  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Putting aside the racial aspect, if you can complete two years at community college with a high GPA, you can probably hack it at 90%+ of the four-year universities in the country.  If you show up to class, study for exams, and make a reasonable effort on papers, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll receive a failing grade in most majors.  Why do regular USC enrollees (not AA&rsquo;s) flunk out if they were smart enough to be admitted in the first place?  The primary reason is maturity.  CC grads usually don&rsquo;t have that problem  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re (at least) two years older, and if you have the motivation to do the work at a CC (sitting alongside idiots, working toward a meaningless degree), you&rsquo;ll likely have the motivation to do the work at USC.  </p>

		<p>At too many community colleges, very little actual freshman and sophomore level work is being completed by the students. In terms of the instruction, almost everything is remedial work trying to teach the students what they ought to have been taught in elementary and high school classes. If the curriculum is dumbed down any further, coloring books and crayons will have to be distributed on the campuses. Issuing a diploma to a minority student is no assurance that he or she has mastered anything. This includes the faculty members.</p>

		<p>Yes, community colleges do teach remedial courses, and large numbers of African Americans do take those courses. In fact, a majority of the ones at St Louis Community college spend their entire pell grant money, and often student loan money taking nothing but remedial courses, and don&rsquo;t end up with a degree, nor transfer to a four year (or longer) program. In many cases it probably isn&rsquo;t a good value for the money as they have little chance of being successful beyond those remedial courses. On the bright side, they get to put &#8220;some college&#8221; on their resume, and a fair number do eventually manage to earn a 2 year degree. </p>
<p>The good: It can be a good value for a good education. The college level courses are still college level courses, and you still have to work hard for them. You aren&rsquo;t getting through calculus, college algebra, or chemistry without working for it, and working hard for it. Some of those remedial courses can prepare people for the college level courses. The bad: Because community colleges offer so many remedial courses, their focus largely becomes remedial courses. Quality instructors are busy teaching lower level classes. For the higher level courses there are not many sections offered, and teacher selection is a lot poorer than it would be otherwise. </p>
