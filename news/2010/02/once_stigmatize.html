<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>[<i>Editor&rsquo;s Note: The</i> New York Times <i>has published a useful map of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/28/us/20091128-foodstamps.html" target="food-stamps" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b><u>food stamp use by county.</u></b></a> Unfortunately, it leaves Hispanics (and Asians) completely out of its figures. Thus, in Webb County, Texas, on the Mexican border, 27 percent of the population gets food stamps, though only 12 percent of whites and 16 percent of blacks do. Obviously, Hispanics have a higher rate of food stamps use than either blacks or whites, but the</i> Times<i> pretends they don&rsquo;t even exist.</i>]</blockquote>

						<p>
							<i>Jason Deparle and Robert Gebeloff, New York Times, February 11, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now the city [New York City] urges the needy to seek aid (in languages from Albanian to Yiddish). Neighborhood groups recruit clients at churches and grocery stores, with materials that all but proclaim a civic duty to apply  &mdash;  to &#8220;help New York farmers, grocers, and businesses.&#8221; There is even a program on Rikers Island to enroll inmates leaving the jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} After a U-turn in the politics of poverty, food stamps, a program once scorned as &#8220;welfare,&#8221; enjoys broad new support. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The program has commercial allies, in farmers and grocery stores, and it got an unexpected boost from President George W. Bush, whose food stamp administrator, Eric Bost, proved an ardent supporter.</p>

		<p>&#8220;One in eight Americans is on food stamps.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing figure, but keep in mind it will increase SUBSTANTIALLY beginning this year.</p>
<p>Cloward/Privens advocated overloading the system until it collapsed, then pushing socialism on the people.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;re going to see that occur, and I&rsquo;m not sure it isn&rsquo;t planned that way in order to bring about a huge change in American society.</p>

		<p>Saying that you have a philosophical reason not to apply for food stamps is starting to have the same effect on people as if you say you, as a white, wouldn&rsquo;t marry a non-white. Immediately stampers start calling you down for how unfeeling and judgemental you are, and how you just don&rsquo;t understand how hard it is, and why there should be no social stigma attached to getting them. When we are going through a really rough time (again), my husband figures out how much in aid we would be eligible for every month with our large family. The amount is quite disturbing. Our children&rsquo;s entitlement-minded friend brags to them about having &#8220;almost $1000 worth of foodstamps in [his] wallet!&#8221; But seeing what an entitlement mentality does to families, to men, to the children raised in it&hellip;those are the things that make us wait for some other non-governmental provision, that has always shown up, and sometimes in bizarre ways.  </p>

		<p>From David Ricardo to Karl Marx, every economist agrees that the more there is of a commodity the less value is placed on that commodity.  Workers are nothing more than a commodity to the cannibal capitialists</p>
<p>The more immigrants arrive and breed,the more workers there are.<br>
I&rsquo;m a county employee in a job that requires a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree.  I have 2 kids.  My take home pay is so low and rent, utilities and commuting are so high that I am eligible for food stamps and section 8 housing.</p>
<p>Being White, I&rsquo;ll never be accepted for section 8 and we would be killed if we moved into a section 8 complex, but I need the food stamps both to feed my kids and to be able to pay rent,utilities and commuting expenses so I can continue working.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white, I&rsquo;m intelligent, but I am also unemployed, trying to support myself and my wife.  I was prodded by my father to apply in the months after I lost my job last year, and I have been getting $92/mo in &#8220;EBT Food&#8221; credit from the State of Florida.  While not much (my wife, being a new immigrant, doesn&rsquo;t count towards benefits), it helps, and I don&rsquo;t have so much pride that I won&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>What burns me is obviously (to me anyway) illegal aliens, i.e. Mestizos in the grocery store with their EBT card handy, with a full cart in the checkout.  The male part of the couple is probably working under the table, while the female has anchor babies.  At least that is my assumption, and it probably isn&rsquo;t too far from reality.</p>

		<p> Andre Bauer&rsquo;s grandmother was right: If you feed them, they breed   &mdash;   even more than they do without free food. He shouldn&rsquo;t have apologized.</p>
<p> And when and where did Ronald Reagan tell the anecdote about the &#8220;strapping buck&#8221; using food stamps to buy &#8220;a T-bone steak&#8221;? Not that that&rsquo;s not true   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m sure something similar happens many times every day in this country.</p>
<p> With the U.S. nearly bankrupt, why in the world should we be encouraging people to line up 10 deep for &#8220;free&#8221; food? My high school band director had a very apt saying: &#8220;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch   &mdash;   somebody always pays.&#8221; In this case, you and me, the U.S. taxpayers.</p>

		<p>I realize that there are always going to be people facing circumstances where they have no choice but to go on the dole while they train or look for a job and try to sort out whatever other wreckage has occurred to their lives.  But there should always be stigma attached to this, because the alternative is far worse   &mdash;   people who spend generation after generation learning how to game the social welfare system and acting as dependents on the rest of society.  This is just what we have created in the black American ghettos, where there has long since ceased to be any stigma about welfare.  Of course high rates of crime go hand in hand with such attitudes.</p>

		<p>In October the income eligibility level for participation in the SNAP (Food Stamp) program was raised, making more people eligible for benefits.  In my state they have advertisements on the sides of buses, in both English and Spanish.  It is promoted just like any other service.</p>

		<p>Following this trend to its end (which may not be far off), certain large segments of the population will essentially be living ENTIRELY off of &#8220;public assistance&#8221; of one form or another. Indeed, many already do, of course. Subsidized Housing, general income (welfare), food (foodstamps, &#8220;free&#8221; lunch programs, etc., medical care (Medicaid, Obamacare, etc.), and so forth are the sole means of sustenance for millions of Americans. How long can this possibly go on before the bottom (ie. the money) completely drops out?    </p>

<p>It is a lot easier for Whites than it was 20 years ago when the benefits offices were staffed entirely by vicious blacks.  Now that affirmative action preference has moved from American blacks to asian and hispanic immigrants most of the discrimination against Whites is gone.</p>
<p>The trick is to find a local office staffed by immigrants, not blacks.  Easy to find, as that is the only demographic governments are hiring these days.  There is a welfare office still staffed by blacks.  Whites just avoid that office and go to another one staffed by asians and hispanic immigrants.</p>
<p>And for all you who sneer at those who work full time and still need food stamps.  I have a choice of either feeding the car I use to get to work gas, tires, insurance etc or feeding my kids.<br>
My take home pay is not enough for both. Public transit is not an option.  It takes 4 buses each way and about 3 1/2 hours to go the 22 miles between home and work by public transit.  That would be 8 buses and 7 hours per round trip by public transit. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eligible for food stamps.  I have no shame in taking them.  What is shameful is that a full time worker in a job that requires a bachelor&rsquo;s degree is paid so low that food stamps are needed to feed a small family of 3.<br>
 <br>
40 years ago my situation would be eased as my children got older and could babysit, mow lawns, shovel snow and work in retail and restaurants, typical teen age jobs of 40 years ago.  But those jobs are now taken by illegal hispanics.</p>
<p>What a country, immigrants who cannot speak understandable english, totally illiterate in both their native language and english, are the favored employees to staff the welfare and unemployment offices that distribute benefits to native born Americans who cannot find work because of Judicial orders that only non White immigrants may be hired.</p>

		<p>Food stamps, free hospitalization, plenty of low skilled employment, etc., all combine to draw cheap labor into this country, which the oligarchs need in order to increase their wealth and power.  That such practice causes absolute chaos in a once fairly stable, homogeneous society, and its efforts toward building an advanced society, with reduced crime and limiless prosperity for everyone, doesn&rsquo;t matter at all to this ruling class.  They have caused the rapid decline of this empire with no apologies and without batting an eye.</p>
<p>No country can long survive with such sinister forces constantly at work to empower and enrich themselves.  We could work toward closing our borders to immigration of all kinds, but it&rsquo;s too late.   The cracks are too numerous to repair. </p>
<p>My sincere suggestion is to get as much from the system as we can, then go shopping for real estate to buy in remote areas where our own system can be set up, not as a parallel society, but a completely separate one with its own heavily armed police force and self-sustaining economy.  In that way we could be the only real civilization standing in a few years.</p>
<p>Fighting to keep what is already in place is like fighting for the ownership of a dead horse.</p>
<p>It is repeated constantly that when the US empire comes down shortly China will be lord and master of the globe.  However, don&rsquo;t be deceived.  China itself is set to have have more trouble than it will be able to handle, mostly because trying to control well over a billion people is an impossible task.  Getting too big is a threat greater than outside armies.</p>

<p>I live in Texas where we have a lot of this and your assuptions are correct. I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times I see a Mexican female in Walmart who can&rsquo;t speak a word of English, pregnant, barely 20 but already has 2 other kids, pulling out her Lone Star card(food stamps) to pay for her huge cart of groceries while her babies&rsquo; daddy is wiring a big wad of cash at the western union back to Mexico.</p>

<p> Wake up America, its still not too late but we must know how and what we are fighting against so that we can meet all  the bleeding heart slogans.</p>
<p> Food stamps or welfare of any kind should be a temporary measure to see our people through crises. Not a way of life as promoted by the Marxist State.</p>

		<p>Pat, I didn&rsquo;t have any problem getting food stamps.  Most of the application was over the net.  I had to talk to someone who sounded like a black woman.  We talked over the phone and she was pleasant to me.  Aside from that, I do wonder why I only get $92/mo, but I guess that is based on my income.</p>
<p>On a related note, my unemployment compensation (a meager $198/wk state and $25/wk federal) is paid by my former employer, a temp agency.  I smile every time I am reminded of that fact, since they don&rsquo;t treat their people very well.</p>

     Cloward &amp; Privens were figuring on having a White proletariat, who would blame the White ruling class for their plight.  What we have instead is a non-White underclass that feeds off the White working class, and a lot of those Whites know it.  They won&rsquo;t be joining up with the diversity crowd to replace a White ruling class with a Red ruling class.  Many posters here look forward to the collapse of our overloaded system, recognizing that in a time of chaos, the ability to make things work will trump the ability to dance.  </p>

This is not an accident, any more than the invasions of all the white countries are happening by a mere accident.

		<p>I am white and on food stamps due to disability, but I live in a virtually all-white area, and all of the food stamp and HUD housing workers have been extremely kind and helpful to me.  I have also lived in heavily-minority areas with all-black post offices and DMVs, and I do sympathize with those who have to seek help from officious, ignorant, deliberately unhelpful minorities.</p>
<p>To the man who has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a low-paying job:  Go to the HUD housing office and ask about HUD programs that DO NOT involve living in a public housing project.  HUD has (or at least used to have) a program called self-help housing, where families work as a team to build a separate house for each family, with a HUD employee helping choose the lots and acting as the &#8220;general contractor,&#8221; with the family members doing a lot of the unskilled/semi-skilled labor.  HUD has MANY programs, including vouchers, etc., that let you rent wherever you want.  Don&rsquo;t assume that you will be turned down.  Apply and see if you qualify.</p>

<p>That was the reason for the Johnson/Nixon/Carter war on poverty program and all those legal aid to get more people on welfare government organizations.</p>
<p>Problem was I think that there just were not  enough welfare receipients in the USA to bring down the system. That&rsquo;s why we are importing the poverty stricken masses of Latin America.  It&rsquo;s lso why every asian over 50 gets social security and disability while working full time in a lucrative family business that cheats its customers, employees, landlords, vendors and pays no taxes.</p>
<p>A few more million more mexicans and asians and california will be truly bankrupt.</p>
<p>I finally got my Mother to end her involvement with an affordable housing for low income senior citizens organization by pointing out that every single one of their tenants were immigrants of one kind or another while native born American elders were homeless this long cold winter.</p>

		<p>I once had a lady friend who was a Welfare Dept. supervisor.  She sure had some interesting stores to tell. From what I recall, she made a sharp distinction between those receiving food stamps and being on welfare. Not the same thing!  There was no stigma attached to getting food stamps, if you&rsquo;re qualified for them. So relax.</p>
