<h1>Montgomery Co. Crime Rate Eclipses Neighboring Fairfax</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Freeman Klopott and Brian Hughes, Washington Examiner (D.C.), February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Montgomery and Fairfax counties are similar is size, population and demographics, but the Maryland county has seen nearly 25 percent more serious crime recently than its neighbor across the Potomac, a study found.</p>
<p>Murders, rapes, assaults, burglaries, and other serious crimes totaled 28,311 in Montgomery County, and 21,319 in Fairfax County in 2008, according to a report released by the Montgomery County Council last week.</p>
<p>The rate of violent crimes in Montgomery is 235 per 100,000 residents, in Fairfax it&rsquo;s 78 per 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>The two counties have a similar demographic breakdown. Fairfax County has a slightly larger population at 1,015,000 compared with Montgomery&rsquo;s 950,680. The median income in Fairfax is higher at $107,075 compared with $93,895 in Montgomery.</p>
<p>Officials and law enforcement policy experts attributed at least a significant part of the crime gap to the counties&rsquo; treatment of gangs and youth.</p>
<p>In October, the Northern Virginia Gang Task Force released a report detailing its success between 2003 and 2008. The report noted that &#8220;many gang members from Northern Virginia are moving or driving to Prince George&rsquo;s and other Maryland counties .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to avoid dealing with police departments that are unrelenting in their efforts to keep gangs under control.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gangs in Montgomery County have also taken violent action. In November 2008, a 14-year-old boy was gunned down on a county bus by an MS-13 gang member. In early 2009, a 15-year-old Hyattsville boy was abducted by 18th Street gang members, who believed he was a member of rival MS-13, and found stabbed to death in Gaithersburg.</p>

		<p>How did this happen? Not long ago, Montgomery Co.,MD, used to be considered a place where only wealthy people lived. Neighborhood names like Bethesda, Kensington, White Oak and Chevy Chase invoked images of huge sprawling brick ranchers and splits with green, perfectly manicured lawns.  Who are these gang members? If they&rsquo;re hispanics(and MS 13 leads to believe they are),neither they nor their families have probably ever paid any(or at least minimal)taxes to suport such an expensive area. If they live in Montgomery County, how can they afford it? I remember when neighboring PG county was almost as nice before it turned into a monstrous ghetto. Back in &#8220;the day,&#8221; most neighbors in these counties knew each other and looked out for one another.  Their kids grew up together and went to school together. The massive immigrant population of today takes no such responsibilty for its community. The county&rsquo;s population is alien in every sense of the word. </p>

		<p>Montgomery County played a game for years, specifically being liberal and getting away with it.  Well, you can get away with it as long as you have a high class of residents.  With the passage of time many of the homes got older, and it was too close to the bad parts of Wash. D.C. and PG County.  The coup de grace was, of course, Montgomery County&rsquo;s generous social welfare programs.  How shall I put it; &#8220;if you feed them, they will come&#8221; &hellip; and they came indeed.</p>
<p>I lived in Chevy Chase for a couple of years in the 1980&rsquo;s and it was a safe, quiet, genteel, old money (mostly) place to be.  It was a bit frumpy, but in a classy way.  When they put in the stupid Friendship Heights metro station it ruined everything.  High rise developments now abound and the individual owned establishments are gone replaced by chain stores.  So gauche.</p>
<p>Demographically, it is a now composed of white geezers, &#8220;sterile&#8221; young whites, and a few breeding pairs of liberal whites left for curiosity&rsquo;s sake.  Plus, the hispanic invasion along with other immigrants is in full force in the less expensive areas dragging the whole county down as the statistics demonstrate.</p>

		<p>Hispanics often live in apartments and they cram 25 people into a three bedroom house.  That&rsquo;s how they can afford to live in nice areas.  </p>

		<p>#1, possibly drug money has enabled them to buy in such areas.  As for Fairfax Co., my well-to-do aunt and uncle used to live there, about 30 years ago.  How it must have changed!</p>

		<p>Agree with above. Lived there around 1970 when buildings and homes, excepting older farms, were mostly new. There were a few problems back then, though nothing to remember racial. There was a culture clash between some raised on farms and outsider&rsquo;s like myself inhabiting those &#8220;little boxes on the hilltop&#8221; making for some fun memories&hellip;</p>
<p>It occurs to me that today&rsquo;s deterioration is analogous to the scientific term Entropy. All systems of high order tend towards disorder over time, if left to themselves. Race mixing itself is an example of decreased order, by pure definition, and it will continue if left unattended.<br>

		<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t mention it, although posters in the article bring it up - Maryland has more stringent gun laws than Virginia does.</p>

		<p>The comments on this thread could have been written by a California White 20 years ago.  Now California is completely over-run and bankrupt and the schools utterly ruined by poor welfare-draining hispanics. </p>
<p> They&rsquo;re looking for greener pastures, more stupid Whites upon whom they can count on to pay for their living expenses (via Section 8 and food stamps while THEY work for cash) and foot the bill for the educations for  their eight anchor children. </p>
<p>The violent gang MS-13, made up of  THIER fatherless, feral young males, is a vicious, violent Saldadorean gang that formed, or so we were told,  in order to &#8216;protect themselves against Whites.&rsquo;  It is a murderous drug gang.</p>
<p>Activists from their many advocacy groups and an unsympathetic media will make sure there is no complaining from you as your taxes skyrocket, schools are destroyed and neighborhoods turned to&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Expect to be called Nazis and Klansmen if you complain, anyone you try to elect to represent your views will be called &#8216;David Duke&rsquo; by the media.  Don&rsquo;t worry, soon they&rsquo;ll field their own racist candidates who&rsquo;ll win due to the colonists becoming a voting bloc.  You&rsquo;ll have an idiot like mayor VivaLaRaza in Los Angeles to run things in the interests of his own people, not you.  Expect English to be the new secondary language, you won&rsquo;t hear it much around town any longer.</p>
<p>Yeah, welcome to our world&hellip;..20 years ago.</p>
<p>Lavinia writes:</p>
<p>&#8221;..How did this happen?&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t heed the lessons we Californians warned you about two decades ago  &mdash;  instead we were heaped with scorn  and laughed at and there were calls to write off California &#8216;give it back to Mexico&rsquo;  &mdash;  all as you continued to elect open borders liberal democrats to represent you.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Not long ago, Montgomery Co.,MD, used to be considered a place where only wealthy people lived&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, so did many  parts of S. California.  Now the wealthy residents that weren&rsquo;t  driven out by satanic taxes are hunkered down behind 10-foot iron fences topped by spikes with cameras mounted around the exterior.  Most have signs in the front yard stating &#8220;Armed Response.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Who are these gang members? If they&rsquo;re hispanics(and MS 13 leads to believe they are),..&#8221;</p>
<p>They are Salvadoreans as I stated above, hiding in plain sight in the illegal colonist community.  Your police, if they&rsquo;re like ours, will be bound by a &#8216;hands off&rsquo; (SpecialOrder 40) policy allowing them to commit murder, robbery and mayhem at will.  They have no fear of the police or of deportation, which they know will never happen.  If they are rounded up, they&rsquo;ll be back within 48 hours, or they&rsquo;ll call their advocacy groups and scream &#8216;Police Brutality.&rsquo;  Many hispanic millionaires were created this way.</p>
<p>From ATBOTL:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hispanics often live in apartments and they cram 25 people into a three bedroom house. That&rsquo;s how they can afford to live in nice areas&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your Department of Health or Housing is like ours (run entirely by hispanics these days) they will be unresponsive to your pleas,  ignore local housing ordinances and you will open yourself up to charges of racism.</p>
<p>You will learn not to  ABETTO, ATBOTL</p>
<p>My advice to those who find themselves newly surrounded by government-created diversity (for you, not for them) is this:  Fence in your property securely  &mdash;  the days of open neighborhoods are over for you.  Garage your cars at night  &mdash;  my insurance demands that my car be in a locked garaged every night.   Invest in a good security system   &mdash;  one with an &#8216;armed response&rsquo;, cameras are good if you can afford them.  </p>
<p>Get a good, large, racist dog and put him in your front yard  &mdash;  one growl and non-Whites, usually terrified of dogs, will avoid your side of the street.  If you have children, get them out of the local schools now and don&rsquo;t look back.  The local schools will soon cater to the colonists, all programs and monies spent on them,  your White children will be marginalized and his honors and AP classes will be eliminated  &mdash;  possibly science labs as well.  All scholarships will go to the new replacement population&rsquo;s children, not yours.</p>
<p>I could go on about hispanic men cat-calling to your young daughters, urinating openly in the streets, throwing trash from cars on your property, hanging out in packs in front of houses  &mdash;  but I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>And lastly, good luck.   You&rsquo;re going to need it.  You too will live in the Land of Babble.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
