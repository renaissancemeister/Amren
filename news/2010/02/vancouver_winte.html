<h1>Vancouver Winter Games: Whitest Opening Ceremonies Ever?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alden E. Habacon, Schema Magazine, February 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Overall, I thought the opening ceremonies was pretty impressive visually.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve got say, other than our beloved Governor General MichaÃ«lle Jean, the incredible display of aboriginal culture, a lightning-quick shot of Patrick Chan, a few Asian-looking dancers, the performance of Measha Brueggergosman and Portuguese-Canadian Nelly Furtado, and a black mountie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was by far the whitest-looking opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really noticeable because of the visual effects and possibly all the international athletes. But then the Olympic flag came out, carried by an all-white cast of Canadian heroes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love all of them.</p>
<p>The picture of a white Canada was reiterated with the unveiling of the final torch bearers. Seeing Rick Hansen was really powerful. I&rsquo;m a HUGE Wayne Gretzky fan (having lived in Edmonton during their Stanley Cup domination), but as Jian Ghomeshi tweeted: &#8220;Love Anne, Bobby et al .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but maybe bit of an oversight to have not one Canadian of colour carrying flag?&#8221; Oversight? To say the least.</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>Absolutely, especially as Vancouver won their bid on the argument that Vancouver is the most diverse place on earth, with the highest rate of mixed-race marriage in N. America, a city that is considered by many (including myself) as part of Asia (forget that &#8220;gateway to Asia&#8221; analogy, that&rsquo;s so ten years ago). The ceremony was hardly representative of Canada&rsquo;s (and especially Vancouver&rsquo;s) multicultural diversity.</p>
<p>Listen, if you&rsquo;re going to reflect Canada&rsquo;s diversity, you can&rsquo;t go full out on aboriginal representation and then FAIL to represent the visible diversity of the local population. Vancouver is a city where &#8220;visible minority&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; don&rsquo;t mean anything anymore, because of the sheer size of the Chinese and South Asian populations.</p>
<p>Oh, I can hear the producers now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8220;But where would we find  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#8221; Oh no, you don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s at least one South Asian RCMP officer. There&rsquo;s gold-winning Olympic hockey player Jarome Iginla! Yes, half is better than none. In this case, token would have been better (than none).</p>
<p>The point is, if you were watching the opening ceremonies on television, you wouldn&rsquo;t even know that it took place in the most Asian city in N. America. Have any of the producers been to a high school in Vancouver?</p>

						<p>
							<i>Paul Farhi, Washington Post, Sunday, February 5, 2006</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>{snip} But the Winter Games are about a few other things as well: elitism, exclusion and the triumph of the world&rsquo;s sporting haves over its have nots.</p>
<p>What the Winter Games are not is a truly international sporting competition that brings the best of the world together to compete, as the promotional blather would have you believe. Unlike the widely attended Summer Olympics, the winter version is almost exclusively the preserve of a narrow, generally wealthy, predominantly Caucasian collection of athletes and nations. In fact, I&rsquo;d suggest that the name of the Winter Games, which start Friday, be changed. They could be more accurately branded &#8220;The European and North American Expensive Sports Festival.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Until as recently as 1994, fewer than a third of the planet&rsquo;s countries took part. This year, in Turin, Italy, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) expects delegations from about 85 countries, an all-time high, but still barely 43 percent of the world&rsquo;s total. Even that exaggerates the extent of participation. Many of the nations in the Opening Ceremonies will be represented by tokens, some consisting entirely of sports bureaucrats, not athletes. Ethiopia, a nation of 73 million, will send its first &#8220;team&#8221; to a Winter Olympics this year  &mdash;  a single skier.</p>
<p>As always, the biggest delegations, and the big winners, will come from a familiar pool. In the history of the winter competition, dating from its inception in 1924, competitors from only six countries  &mdash;  the Soviet Union/Russia, Germany (East, West and combined), Norway, the United States, Austria and Finland, in that order  &mdash;  have won almost two-thirds of all the medals awarded. Only 17 countries have ever amassed more than 10 medals during the past 19 winter Olympiads. Only 38 countries have won even one medal.</p>
<p>This had turned the Winter Olympics into a remarkably insular competition. The Czech Republic (and Czechoslovakia before it) has won more medals than China, home to about one-fifth of humanity. Norway, a nation with a population smaller than metropolitan Washington, has won three times as many winter medals as the nations of Asia, Latin and South America, Australia and Polynesia, the Middle East and the Caribbean Basin combined.</p>
<p>By contrast, the all-time list of summer winners is long and deep, extending to athletes from 143 countries, including such places as Tonga, Paraguay and Burundi. {snip}</p>
<p>Obviously, the climate and terrain in, say, Indonesia or Aruba aren&rsquo;t highly conducive to molding superstar aerial skiers and biathlon champions. But it&rsquo;s not just the presence or absence of snow and ice that determines Winter Olympics success, or even participation. If it were, some of America&rsquo;s best ice skaters and speedskaters wouldn&rsquo;t live and train in Southern California or Florida. If it were, athletes from countries like Peru, Chile, Nepal, Morocco, Afghanistan and Ethiopia  &mdash;  all blessed with soaring, snow-covered mountains  &mdash;  would be marching en masse in the Opening Ceremonies and fighting for the medal stand.</p>
<p>Instead, the more telling factors are economic. Would-be Winter Olympians need years of training, coaching and competition if they&rsquo;re going to make it to the Games. All of these things require massive sums of money. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike the Winter Games, the Summer Olympics level many of the advantages of national wealth, as well as favorable geography and climate. It takes all the usual things to become a Summer Olympian  &mdash;  heart, outsized talent and the ability to devote most of your waking hours to your sport  &mdash;  but the barriers to entry are much lower. Athletes from the poorest African and Caribbean nations have developed into some of the world&rsquo;s greatest athletes with shockingly minimal, or even nonexistent, facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>In winter sports, by contrast, the rich keep getting richer. Nations wealthy enough to host a Winter Olympics tend to be those that win most of the medals (17 of the 20 Winter Olympics have been held in Western Europe, Canada or the United States). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So why perpetuate an event that could just as easily be contested as a series of disaggregated annual championships? The reason, of course, is money and TV. And here again, it&rsquo;s a small world. The Winter Olympics might collapse were it not for the financial support of American broadcasters and their (mostly) American advertisers. Like the teams themselves, the audience for the Winter Olympics is predominantly North American and European, accounting for about two-thirds of all worldwide viewing during the Salt Lake City Games of 2002, according to the IOC. {snip}</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that Winter Olympians aren&rsquo;t dedicated and superb athletes. They are, of course. But the pool of actual and potential competitors in, say, luge or curling (or skeleton or biathlon or bobsledding or freestyle moguls skiing) is ludicrously small and will probably remain so for years to come. The Winter Olympics simply aren&rsquo;t, and probably can&rsquo;t be, a truly global sporting contest.</p>

<p><br>
Yes, and that&rsquo;s why I would never want to move back to Vancouver, despite its mild climate and gorgeous geographical setting. It took living as a white man in a white-minority city to make me realize what would happen if whites in Canada were reduced to a minority. Only whites are expected to feel compassion for people of other races and cultures (and do so). Non-whites don&rsquo;t feel and act this way.<br>

		<p>These liberals on race are always talking about how race is just a &#8220;social construct&#8221; and that it doesn&rsquo;t really exist; they believe that to notice anything about race is blatant racism. Ironically, these same egalitarians always appear to be the most obsessed with race (this article being proof).</p>

		<p>Matt, I&rsquo;m going to disagree with you that non-whites don&rsquo;t have compassion for others. The reason you may perceive a lack of compassion is due to the fact that distrust still persists. For example, let&rsquo;s take Canada&rsquo;s aboriginals. Even though they were integral to the survival of the early European settlers, it is precisely because of their trusting nature that they were manipulated, killed and lost everything. Blacks remember slavery and India was completely colonized by the British. China is a resilient ancient civilization still standing today, and they remain cognizant of the fact that Europeans - attempted - to divide and conquer them in the early 20th century. Simply put, get off your moral high horse. Compassion was somewhat lost when all the above happened and trust needs time to be rebuilt.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A pair of speedskates might be relatively cheap, but how many countries have speedskating rinks? Most nations, even those with plenty of snow and cold, simply can&rsquo;t afford such extravagances.&#8221;</p>
<p>You hit the nail, Mr. Farhi. Czech republic doesn&rsquo;t have a single speedskating rink. The number of registered speedskaters is around 70 people. Martina Sablikova trains on a frozen pond. Damn, how can she afford a gold medal?!</p>

		<p>Watching the opening ceremonies was a sight for sore eyes. <br>
 <br>
It was so white you&rsquo;d never think North America or any of those European countries were anything other than that. Even the English athletes were all ethnically English,- except maybe one.</p>
<p>Attractive, fair skinned, blondes, redheads, blue, hazel and green eyed atheletes from western nations just kept filing in, one group after the other.</p>
<p> Although it wasn&rsquo;t an accurate racial representation of almost all participating countries, I was nevertheless quite pleased.  </p>

		<p>This complaint of &#8220;too white&#8221; &#8220;too many whites&#8221; &#8220;not enough diversity&#8221; a la Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann of the whites, and just about every talking black for the blacks, is a trick played on decent whites to make themselves doubt what is natural.</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t naturally want to have a single black in their midst, and especially not be surrounded by them.</p>
<p>The complaints about &#8220;lack of diversity&#8221; are meant to put voices into the heads of whites so they will constantly be asking themselves if they are doing enough to &#8220;foster diversity&#8221; and including blacks in their social activities and business meetings.</p>
<p>The complaints are a form of cultural critique and shaming. The major premise is that nothing good can come of humanity unless all colors of humanity participate. White Isaac Newton did not invent the theory of gravity until he was given permission to think about it by the black African kings.</p>
<p>Theses answers should be to anybody who complains about lack of diversity:  </p>
<p>To Whites: Please show us how to TAKE diversity into non diverse communities by taking yourself and your family into a black neighborhood and staying there.</p>
<p>To Blacks: What can you do to help whites TAKE their diversity into black neighborhoods and keep it there?<br>

		<p>It was hard to sit through these two articles. Both were non stop attacks on Whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; this was by far the whitest-looking opening ceremonies.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
And this is a problem because???&hellip;&hellip;..I wonder if this writer bothered to look at the athletes or even the spectators? My guess is they were even whiter than those involved in the opening ceremonies. I wonder if the writer plans on chastising Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;people of color&#8221; for not showing up to support Canada&rsquo;s olympians? Nah. That would involve writing harshly about non Whites. Its doubtful if the writer would know how to do this. </p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can hear the producers now &hellip; &ldquo;But where would we find &hellip; ?&rdquo; Oh no, you don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s at least one South Asian RCMP officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess the writer wants this mountie singled out for this honor because he is non White. This from someone who sure is proud of Vancouver&rsquo;s multiculturalism, diversity and miscegenation rate. Obviously a person who believes we should all strive to live in a colorblind society. Odd that she is so race conscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s gold-winning Olympic hockey player Jarome Iginla! Yes, half is better than none. In this case, token would have been better (than none).&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: Half a non White is better than someone who is all White any day. <br>

Paul Farhi:</p>
<p>&#8221; But the Winter Games are about a few other things as well: elitism, exclusion and the triumph of the world&rsquo;s sporting haves over its have nots.&#8221;</p>
<p>More Whitey bashing. Perhaps someone should tell Mr farhi just why the have nots, have not. Here&rsquo;s a hint Mr farhi. It is not the fault of the world&rsquo;s White nations that Haiti, the Sudan, Ecuador, etc, do not have ski slopes or even indoor ice rinks to practice on. Unless of course you re one of those that thinks Whitey should fund arenas, equipment, etc, so the world doesnt have to suffer the indignity of a too White, Olympics. </p>
<p>&#8221; Until as recently as 1994, fewer than a third of the planet&rsquo;s countries took part. This year, in Turin, Italy, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) expects delegations from about 85 countries, an all-time high, but still barely 43 percent of the world&rsquo;s total.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Kindly point out for us Mr farhi, just which nations are BARRED from competition? If you answered &#8220;none&#8221;, then you&rsquo;d have to admit that any nation not represented at the winter games did so by choice. Are you blaming this on White nations? </p>
<p>I could go on with this writer&rsquo;s bashing of White&rsquo;s for the non participation of non White nations in the winter games, but it is getting tiresome. But in case Mr farhi is reading this, I will say this: Mr farhi APPEARS to be a White man in his photos. No doubt this adds to the dreaded &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; at the Washington Post. If you would kindly resign your position Mr farhi so a person of color could have it, it would increase diversity  at the paper. You sure know how to talk the talk. But are you willing to walk the walk???</p>

This guy is a marxist&hellip; bringing up the proletariot class struggles in a sports article.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen extreme hatred of the Winter Olympics in many places on the internet and elsewhere. Usually with the admonishment that it is too white. That is reason enough for me to watch, have to find some time this weekend.</p>
<p>As the first author stated Vancouver is now an Asian city. Some wouldn&rsquo;t be so proud of this fact but Mr. Habacon I guess is one who does. He&rsquo;s a Canadian professional anti-whiter (aka  Diversitycrat):</p>

		<p>So the presence of snow in some countries is racist or helps the cause of racism?  Look, winter sports are white people sports.  I went to an ice rink in my local area.  It is a big urban city where almost everyone is latino, black or asian.  On the ice there was only maybe 20% white people.  Then there were about 25% asian people.  The rest were blacks and latinos.  The whites were all so natural on the ice - very little stumbling or falls.  Most of the asians were doing okay, but the blacks and latinos were falling all over the place, clinging to the wall, crashing, etc.  In the food line at the little snack window just outside the rink, the line was ful of very rotund minorities.  All the people in charge were white and the rink staff with skates on were evenly divided between whites and asians.</p>

		<p>So, how many black people do you know who like snow sports?  Most are warm-weather freaks; a generality is to say blacks don&rsquo;t like cold weather.  We have one black guy on our speed skating team, and he won   &mdash;   but he&rsquo;s the only black guy, aside from the African teams, that I&rsquo;ve seen at the winter games.  It isn&rsquo;t ability that stops blacks - they just don&rsquo;t favor snow and ice.</p>

<p>Iginla is actually competing in the games, so he was with the rest of the Canadian team and wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to carry the Olympic flag.  But there was plenty of &#8220;diversity&#8221; in the torch-lighting ceremony- there was a paraplegic, a woman, even an &#8220;African-Canadian&#8221;&hellip; Steve Nash.

		<p>Winter Olympics are winter games, winter games require cold weather or snow or a combination of the two. Most but not all non white populations live in warmer climates and those who do not do participate in the games (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, central Asia, etc. </p>
<p>I guess the authors just want to complain because they know that people in Zaire, Fiji, Brazil, Oman, Costa Rica and the like do not and will not have places to practice the luge, snowboarding, various ski events, etc. </p>

<p>I think the host country doesn&rsquo;t have as stringent requirements for the number of athletes it sends to its own games.  In spite of it being a much less populous country, Canada has almost as many athletes at Vancouver as the United States.</p>
<p>Therefore, China had a huge delegation in Beijing.  It won more golds overall than the United States, and almost as many medals overall, simply because it spammed the games with so many competitors.  I&rsquo;m not surprised that you think it was so Asian there.</p>

<p>Ghomeshi isn&rsquo;t Canadian, so what do we care what he might think?. His own web-site says, &#8220;Jian takes pride in his Iranian heritage as well as his Canadian citizenship.&#8221; That&rsquo;s right, he&rsquo;s a citizen, not a Canadian. Secondly, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a Canadian of colour. Colourful immigrants and their offspring, born here or not, are not rightfully Canadian, but citizens, and often not even good one&rsquo;s, hence our colourful criminal statistics and even more colourful welfare rolls.</p>
<p>82% of the population of Canada is of Angl-European heritage, and those are the very people who discovered, explored, created and developed this great country. All the third-world immigrants who came later are here for their own benefit, not ours. So, if someone thinks there aren&rsquo;t enough wonderfully colourful people from third-world countires should go and live in China or India and truly enjoy the virtues of their convictions.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed with every Olympic Winter Games the level of outright hatred toward it is ratcheted up.  The simple fact is that people like the writers of these two hate pieces cannot stand the fact that white people, in this case white athletes, are celebrated for any reason whatsoever.  I don&rsquo;t care that these self hating bottom feeders feel the way that they do, it just annoys me that they get a forum to display their hatred while getting paid for it.  </p>
<p>But, for all the diversity loving white-haters out there, hope is on the way.  Rest assured that the next Summer Games in London will no doubt be the most absurdly nauseatingly multi-cult celebration in history.

<p>As far as Anonymous wrote at 7:51 PM on February 18: <br>
&#8220;Matt, I&rsquo;m going to disagree with you that non-whites don&rsquo;t have compassion for others. The reason you may perceive a lack of compassion is due to the fact that distrust still persists. For example, let&rsquo;s take Canada&rsquo;s aboriginals. Even though they were integral to the survival of the early European settlers, it is precisely because of their trusting nature that they were manipulated, killed and lost everything. Blacks remember slavery and India was completely colonized by the British. China is a resilient ancient civilization still standing today, and they remain cognizant of the fact that Europeans - attempted - to divide and conquer them in the early 20th century. Simply put, get off your moral high horse. Compassion was somewhat lost when all the above happened and trust needs time to be rebuilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>  You cannot be more wrong, Blacks and Arabs were enslaving blacks far before Whites even entered the enslaving business. Europeans were the ones who stopped slavery, even using military force on Arabs and African chiefs to stop the practice. V.S. Naipaul wrote in one of his books about how French missionaries in earlier centuries would pay Arab slave traders to get black slaves released and how they would help the blacks set up villages. But in just some months those blacks would be re-enslaved by neighbouring black tribes and sold to the Arabs again. North Africans enslaved a million Europeans, but Europeans foolishly trust them and have allowed millions of them to live in Europe. India was conquered for a thousand years before the British, Dutch,  French and the Portuguese ever went there. Arabs, Persians, Afghans, Mughals (Mongols), Scythians, Huns etc&hellip; have been conquering India for years. And Indians have been killing each other before the British or even the Islamic eras. I was reading in a book somewhere where Indian merchants and caravans in the 1800s felt safer in the British run areas as British forces deterred dacoits and thugs. Non-Whites hardly donate to causes for other non-Whites, only White people do it. Most non-Whites only care for their own kind and are thus selfish. None of them have the universal altruistic tendencies which White people have. These tendencies have become a curse for the White race.<br>

<p>This is tripe, pure nonsense.  4 - Anonymous wants to pretend that Amerinds, East Indians, even the Chinese, (include Japan) would be better off today if white European nations had not explored and brought moderninity to the world (and themselves in the process).  My ancestors were among the first French in Canada.  Some Amerinds wished to trade and others did not welcome them but attacked them almost from the start.  The first French were fur trapper/traders who came only for that business with no intention to settle.  France never intended to make permanent settlements.  Louis lV was actually afraid of depopulating France.  Later, he only reluctantly let some young women go to Quebec for the purpose of marrying the very small number of trappers/traders there.  Once the women arrived Amerind attacks exploded.  Amerinds had long practiced hostage taking and slave trading among themselves and the new type of female was highly desireable.  The first Canadian Indian War occured because of these attacks and slaughters of whites.  That &#8220;war&#8221; ended dubiously because by the time the French Regiment located the Amerinds, many had died of smallpox.  (And don&rsquo;t go on about &#8220;white diseases&#8221; they all came from Asia to Europe first and Syphilis and gonorhea were Amerind diseases that ravaged Europe).  I accept the tragic side of history as part of the world&rsquo;s growing pains.  People like you select and exploit instances for the purpose of parlaying them into monetary/social benefits from the very cultures and establishments today.  Today&rsquo;s complainers like to imagine an indealized pre-white past.</p>
<p>I have been reading a book that I encourage ALL Amren posters/readers to acquire and study.  It is a history of the 19th century Indian slaving/captivity of whites during the period of 1830-1885 in the American Midwest.  &#8220;A Fate Worse than Death,&#8221; by historians Gregory and Susan Michno.  The modern apologist for the notion quaint tribal civilizations as projected by nonsensical films such as &#8220;Dances with Wolves&#8221; are well debunked.  In the conclusion, the authors march through recent historic revisions of Amerind history and debunk them. If Amerinds lost their primative, hunter gatherer culture they got the horse, the gun, and now pick-up trucks and exclusive gambling concessions - all of which they always happily adapted to using.  Primitive peoples often forget the short life expectancy of the the pre-white/pre-modern era. </p>
<p>Through this and other historic reading on the subject, I have come to the conclusion that without the same sort of perseverence that defeated Germany and Japan in WW2, and the thoroughness of that defeat, North American Aboriginals would still be committing horrible crimes against whites, especially women and children.  In fact, that culture is still there (see Richard Allen Davis).  It seems to require that level of devastation to pacify a people, and Pacify is exactly what the U.S. government called their campaign to convince Amerinds to adapt a more settled and peaceful way life.  Also, it must be noted here that many tribes never had a problem with this concept and always had been peaceful.  It was renegades tribes mostly, the ones that had victimized other tribes before and after the advent of whites that were the ones that had to be &#8220;Pacified&#8221; in the American West.  Many whites suffered horrible fates and suffered through extreme brutality in the settling of the American West.  In fact, many of the historical records are actually &#8220;deprivation&#8221; requests filed by the white victims of Amerind atrocities who had been encouraged to settle (and many of them were German and Scandinavians who had been lured over by U.S. government approved advertising).  </p>
<p>Further, without the British occupation and inclusion in the modern Commonwealth India would still be a collection of warring tribes, much as Northern Pakistan and Afghanistan is today and not an emerging world economy (despite its ongoing ethnic/religious violence). Britain was able to dominate in China in the 19th century because China had been tearing itself apart for hundreds of years.  Should Western nations simply left Japan alone to continue its medieval war lord society? </p>
<p>Historian Carrol Quigley noted that the 20th century only truly began in 1945 because the momentum of cause and effect of the 19th century was concluded by WW2, and the first use of an atomic bomb issued in a new historic epoch.  Those who wish to dip back into past eras for the purpose of reviving issues are those who would take the entire world back into previous, unsuccessful patterns. </p>
<p>  Europeans went through the pains of modernization themselves and suffered through horrible ethnic and cultural slaughters before the beginning of the modern era and even well into it. The earliest known attackers of the West were the Persians (they started it), followed by Ghengis Khan, the Huns, Islam during the initial Arab Expansion, etc.  This is to say nothing of the diseases, continued slave raids, (up until the late 19th century) and the myriad of complaints that would silence ignorant comments from those of the ilk of 4- Anonymous.</p>
<p>We have ALL paid the price for what everyone the world over seems to agree by participation and aspiration to modernity.  It is simply dishonest and lazy to fall back on all the preceeding suffering and loss produced in previous ages.  Groups who still claim that they can&rsquo;t trust &#8220;whitey&#8221; or today&rsquo;s overwhelmingly liberal and overcompensating Western governments are simply narrow minded by selective intention.  They persist in this vein of thought and complaint precisely because they see a continued economic and social benefit from that very system via claiming/extracting every easily garnered benefits.  The real question is; Do we want a modern world that destroys racial, ethnic, and cultural identity in the name of some sort of supposed coming era of utopian equality.  I believe that the disruption and destruction of any group is by today&rsquo;s standards wrong.  I further believe (and I think I have this in common with Amren and its chronic posters) that destroying the very race, culture, and ethnic group(s) that have created the modern era is not only wrong, but also the guarantee of a global demise.  (But whites must continue to purge themselves of backward tendancies as well).   </p>
<p>Philosophically speaking, it may be that the entire human race is doomed to be a victim of itself.  However, this victimization of whites as evil because they led the charge into the modern era is a cheap and (at least to me) completely transparent excuse for lack of success and continued parasitism as well as the blantant indulgence in their own form of racism.</p>

<p>We in the West are absolutely expected to welcome and embrace racial minorities and give them equal (or superior) roles in our own nations. Asia isn&rsquo;t expected to welcome or embrace us at all. Thus is the recipe for the demise of white Europeans as a people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that Habacon doesn&rsquo;t at all have a problem with the fact that Asian minorities do better educationally and economically than whites in white-majority countries. In places where they may do worse, however, like in winter sports, the government is obliged to give them a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p>Vancouver has no obligation to present its Asian side. It is not the Asian population that has made Vancouver a nice place. It is its niceness, built painstakingly by whites for over a century, that has made it attractive to Asians.</p>
<p>We whites are being lulled to sleep by the beauty of the societies we have created. We are being lulled to our demise.</p>

		<p>The non Europeans have their own exclusive Olympic Festival though - it&rsquo;s a festival of churning out anti-white diatribe after anti-white diatribe whenever they see white people doing anything together and enjoying themselves together.</p>

		<p>Defintely, snow is racist. Why it has to be so damn white? I suggest to spray it, maybe in a brown colour?</p>
