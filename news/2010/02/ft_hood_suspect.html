			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bryan Bender, Boston Globe, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Army superiors were warned about the radicalization of Major Nidal Malik Hasan years before he allegedly massacred 13 soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, but did not act in part because they valued the rare diversity of having a Muslim psychiatrist, military investigators wrote in previously undisclosed reports.</p>
<p>An obvious &#8220;problem child&#8221; spouting extremist views, Hasan made numerous statements that were not protected by the First Amendment and were grounds for discharge by violating his military oath, investigators found.</p>
<p>Examples of Hasan&rsquo;s radical behavior have previously been disclosed in press accounts based on interviews with unnamed Army officials, including his defense of suicide bombings and assertions that Islamic law took priority over his allegiance to the United States.</p>
<p>But the Pentagon&rsquo;s careful documentation of individual episodes dating back to 2005 and the subsequent inaction of his superiors have not been made public before.</p>
<p>The Globe was permitted to review the Army&rsquo;s more complete findings on the condition that it not name supervisory officers who did not act, some of whom are facing possible disciplinary action.</p>
<p>In searching for explanations for why superiors did not move to revoke Hasan&rsquo;s security clearances or expel him from the Army, the report portrays colleagues and superiors as possibly reluctant to lose one of the Army&rsquo;s few Muslim mental health specialists.</p>
<p>The report concludes that because the Army had attracted only one Muslim psychiatrist in addition to Hasan since 2001, &#8220;it is possible some were afraid&#8221; of losing such diversity &#8220;and thus were willing to overlook Hasan&rsquo;s deficiencies as an officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several of his supervisors explicitly mentioned Hasan&rsquo;s potential to inform our understanding of Islamic culture and how it relates to the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,&#8221; the investigators found.</p>
<p>In one classroom incident not previously described by the Army  &mdash;  which parallels another episode around the same time that has received press attention  &mdash;  Hasan gave a presentation in August 2007 titled &#8220;Is the War on Terrorism a War on Islam: An Islamic Perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the presentation was &#8220;shut down&#8221; by the instructor because Hasan appeared to be defending terrorism. Witnesses told investigators that Hasan became visibly upset as a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students reported his statements to superior officers, who took no action on the basis that Major Hasan&rsquo;s statements were protected by the First Amendment,&#8221; the investigation found. &#8220;They did not counsel Hasan and consider administrative action, even though not all protected speech is compatible with continued military service.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But based on Army documents, interviews with witnesses, and sworn statements to the FBI, the review panel&rsquo;s findings provide the most detailed picture yet of Hasan&rsquo;s transformation from a bright prospect in the Army&rsquo;s medical corps to a loner with increasingly extremist views.</p>
<p>They also contain the first official acknowledgement that superiors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where he began his residency in 2003, were repeatedly informed of Hasan&rsquo;s radical statements but did not do anything about it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New details also emerge of Hasan&rsquo;s pattern of radical behavior, the first signs of which were detected in 2005, according to at least four officers who worked with him at the time and spoke to the FBI and Pentagon investigators.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength. And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; Casey said.</p>
<p>That is a death knell of the republic.  The non diversities who built this country have handed it over to the diversities who will destroy it.  Our white elites will be studied in the future and diagnosed as having severe mental impairments brought on by a genetic flaw that made them susceptible to &#8220;showing kindness to the strangers&#8221;, even when the strange diversities are your sworn moral enemy.  </p>
<p>We will be studied and held up as examples of a failed experiment in social science, suicide by social science.</p>

		<p>Had this person(certainly not a soldier)been assigned to a combat arm unit(Inf, Arty, Armor)he would have long ago parted  ways with the Army.  However, the Army&rsquo;s Medical Units seem to attract people like him.  On one of my tours with the Army in Vietnam(44th Medical Brigade)we had several &#8220;strange ones&#8221; that in a combat arm unit would have been shipped back to the USA for discharge at once.  The Thanksgiving &#8220;sit-in&#8221; in 1969 at one of the Evac hospitals springs to mind.  The leader of this protest was allowed to linger, with intent to disrupt, for months before USARV ejected from in-country.  I had the pleasure to see him leave the country, I took him to the aerial port, and as far as I know, never was he heard from again.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will be a great comfort for the victims&rsquo; families to know that their loved ones died for diversity.  </p>
<p>So why was it so important for them to have Muslim shrinks?  Oh yeah, so they can better treat the Muslim troops.  And why do we need Muslim troops?  So we can more easily invade Muslim lands - but it seems to me that we&rsquo;re the ones being invaded.</p>

<p>So this murderer&rsquo;s &#8220;defense of suicide bombings and assertions that Islamic law took priority over his allegiance to the United States&#8221;, was only seen as a &#8220;deficiency&#8221; by these geniuses?? A military officer who holds extremist islam loyalties above his &#8220;loyalty&#8221; to the United States?? All this was overlooked in the name of diversity??</p>
<p>Those who had the power AND OBLIGATION to do something about this thug, and chose to ignore his lunacy, should be put on trial as accessories to murder. But since we ALL know that isnt about to happen, they should be court martialed for dereliction of duty or whatever military charge would apply and drummed out of the service and lose all benefits along with their dishonorable discharge. Having their pictures in the media, tv, print and the internet, telling all that these are the people responsible for giving this thug the opportunity to kill 13 American soldiers, would be a nice added touch. The world needs to be told these people allowed this massacre to take place. And for pc reasons. <br>

<p>In other words, it turns out that those of us who said this entire murderous incident can be laid directly at the feet of political correctness were unequivocally correct.  It&rsquo;s more important to the brass to be politically correct than to assure the safety of their personnel.</p>
<p>And we have seen many signs of this in the last several years, the worst of which started with Carter, accelerated through the Clinton era, getting even worse with each passing year until it has reached the point where it is right now:  An almost dysfunctional military.  </p>
<p>Whether it is women in military positions that should be filled with males, unqualified blacks in leadership positions and high tech MOS&rsquo;s, or Muslims in positions where they can easily sabatoge something or kill someone, they all amount to aspects of deterioration that have been supported or even applauded by the Pentagon brass.</p>
<p>I wonder if they call those murdered by this Muslim psychiatrist collateral damage and just so much rubbish they&rsquo;re prepared to lose?  And I wonder if the lives that are going to be lost because of this drift toward the far left are going to be regarded as no more than the cost for doing business, while protecting careers by bowing to the dictates of political correctness?</p>
<p>The US military has reached the point where no white kid can feel safe, and, as several military experts said when the announcement to allow gays was made, the US armed forces are going to see a fleet footed disappearance of many of its best members, leaving a skeleton crew of politically correct incompetents.</p>

		<p>The horrors of Diversity make me yearn for the tradional values of Affirmative Action. These were introduced in the 1960&rsquo;s, and provided a limited employment and schooling boost to women and Blacks. No benefits were given to Hispanic, Oriental, Native, or other special Americans. I never thought that AA was only one step toward the present situation: pervasive discrimination against White men who are not useful to Liberalism.</p>

		<p>I hate to be a broken record,but&hellip;this point has to be repeated over and over again:invading the world goes hand-in-hand with the race-replacement of the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORITY OF AMERICA. I think it was Sailer who coined the term invade-the-world-invite the world.</p>
<p>The Generals and Admirals are  all race traitors. What they want is canon fodder for Republican and Democratic wars of aggression. If there was a military draft tommorow, the United States would be out of Iraq and Iran within a couple of months. In fact, one can say with 100 percent certainty thqt Iraq war 1 and Iraq war 2 would never have occured. When the Generals and Admirals blather on about the nonsense about diversity, the translation is this:look Republican-Democratic imperial wars of aggression could potentially cost the lives of a whole lot of White American teenagers. The majority White American population will never go along with this.Therefore, we need to import warm teenager bodies from mexico,haiti,iraq,Egypt&hellip;. It is no more complicated than this.</p>
<p>The Generals and Admirals are not patriots. They are basically mafia-type hit men for the rackets corprations are runnig around the world. The whole thing is disgusting and evil. The racket requires the race-replacement of the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORIY. You wont see China and Russia importing its military anytime soon.</p>

		<p>Perhaps one of the saddest things to come out of this tragety will be when one of the victim&rsquo;s family members speaks out against his/her government&rsquo;s lack of proper action.  They will say publicly what we are all feeling right now and if the statement is against our society&rsquo;s diversity agenda they will be labeled as a right-wing hate monger.  13 people were murdered cowardly in service to thier country upholding the constitution that protects our citizens, including the media.  If the victims&rsquo; families speak ill of muslim terror or diversity that same media will BASH those victims&rsquo; families.  This is exactly how warped our society has become.  We must at all costs protect a twisted suicidal ideology ahead of murder victims.  </p>

<p>That is exactly what traitors such as General Casey and Admiral Mike Mullins are telling the victims family. The ideology of the invite the world-invade the world goes like this:we are going to impose gay rights,feminism and multiculturalism upon the muslims and those pesky Christian Serbs if they like it or not. They are very open about this. Of course the real reason for intervention in these nations is Republican-Democratic gangersterism.</p>
<p>As General Smedley Butler wrote 70 tears ago in his autobiography:&#8221;I was a hitman for the corporations&#8221; and &#8220;War is a racket&#8221;. General Casey and Admiral Mike Mullins, enthusiasts for the race-replacament of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS, besides being race traitors, are ultimately nothing more than hitman for the corporate gangsters who own the Republican and Democratic parties&hellip;.This what the Victims of he Fort Hood shooting really died for.<br>

		<p>To Lou Gots - I can personally attest to the FACT that Officer Evaluations DO contain a section rating an officer on his or her EEOC  support (code for PC diversity acceptance and promotion of AA).  Combine that with the well known inflationary state of Officer Evaluations before promotion boards - the unspoken knowledge that officers must &#8220;max&#8221; the OE (highest ratings across the board) and officers know that if they are not rated with the highest mark for supporting the EEOC section, they will suffer.  Yes.  Officer evaluations DO contain a rating for compliance with and promotion of EEOC programs and policies.  What that effectively means is that officers who spoke out about this guy&rsquo;s danger suffered at time for promotion, while those who ignored the obvious WERE promoted.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so dismayed and disgusted with the leaders of our military I&rsquo;m beside myself!  Every day I hear something about us apologizing for injuring civilians in Afghanistan and carrying on as though every unintended casualty is a war crime!  The Taliban must be rolling in the dirt cackling!  And, of course, they know exactly how to deter our attacks now!<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe the military and political establishments are still talking about winning hearts and minds!  It&rsquo;s as though absolutely nothing has been learned since Vietnam!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, diversity is a strength.  It strengthens the standard of living of minorities who glean from the technological, cultural and financial accomplishments of Caucasians.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the minorities have no such accomplishments with which to reciprocate.  </p>

		<p>But should Muslims be even allowed to serve in the US army, in the present context?</p>
<p>Could the US Navy put a Muslim officer, in command of a submarine, with a full compliment of missiles with nuclear warheads? </p>
<p>I think the US, and the entire Western civilization, can not take that kind of risk.</p>

<p>That will never happen. Thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feres_doctrine" rel="nofollow">&#8220;<i>Feres</i> doctrine&#8221;</a>, the military is effectively immune from any civil action by servicemen or their families regardless of negligence or even malice on its part. In 1986 the SCOTUS ruled that <i>Feres</i> even applied to soldiers who were given LSD without their knowledge as part of mind-control experiments in the 1950s. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard predictions that such an exodus will result in revival of the draft and/or near universal stop-loss. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the hidden agenda behind this scheme.</p>

		<p>German-Americans may have been willing to kill German civilians during WWII but can we expect or assume the same dedication to U.S. on part of radical Muslims?</p>
<p>NO! seen evidence of that already over here in the Muddled East.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the military and political establishments are still talking about winning hearts and minds!</p>
<p>Indeed! I was with the initial groups which fostered the &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; ideaology when, at the time, most of us figured if we kill the bodies, the hearts and minds would follow!! Simple really. And a good reason for being in the Iraq/Afghan/everywhere else wars are simply stated by Julius Caesar of ancient Rome. To paraphrase, &#8220;an army with nothing to do gets into trouble at home&#8221; he also said &#8220;Caesar makes law, but the army makes it legal&#8221; As always, GOD WILL NOT HELP US!</p>

		<p>I remember reading in Chronicles of Culture something about how some American officer was likely feeding information to the Serbs about upcoming air strikes during our war to expand Albania.  I would like to hope that there are more officers who place loyalty to the West above loyalty to Washington DC.  <br>
     The Evil is accelerating.  Right now the Regime is pushing homosexuals everywhere and women in submarines.  Better to scuttle the Navy and crash every plane in the Air Force than hand it over to the Reds.  </p>

		<p>Our national motto is &ldquo;e pluribus unum&rdquo; (Out of many&hellip; One).  </p>
<p>The treasonous unity destroying &rdquo;diversity&rdquo; (Out of one&hellip; many) being evangelized by business and government is an attempt to destroy the very foundation upon which this nation was built.  </p>
<p>Know these corporate and political traitors for what they are and be prepared to introduce them to summary justice when we make our move to reclaim this nation for ourselves and our posterity&hellip;   </p>
