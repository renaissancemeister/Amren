<h1><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE61900L20100210">Low Intelligence Among Top Heart Health Risks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Kelland, Reuters, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Intelligence comes second only to smoking as a predictor of heart disease, scientists said on Wednesday, suggesting public health campaigns may need to be designed for people with lower IQs if they are to work.</p>
<p>Research by Britain&rsquo;s Medical Research Council (MRC) found that lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were associated with higher rates of heart disease and death, and were more important indicators than any other risk factors except smoking.</p>
<p>Heart disease is the leading killer of men and women Europe, the United States and most industrialised countries.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes accounted for 32 percent of all deaths around the world in 2005.</p>
<p>It is well known that people with poorer education and lower incomes often face higher risks of ill health and a range of diseases. Studies have pointed to many likely reasons, including limited access to healthcare and other resources, poorer living conditions, chronic stress and higher rates of lifestyle risk factors like smoking.</p>
<p>The MRC study, which analysed data from 1,145 men and women aged around 55 and followed up for 20 years, rated the top five heart disease risk factors as cigarette smoking, IQ, low income, high blood pressure, and low physical activity.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by David Batty of the MRC and Social and Public Health Science Unit in Glasgow, Scotland, said there were &#8220;a number of plausible mechanisms&#8221; which might explain why lower IQ scores could raise the risk of heart disease  &mdash;  in particular a person&rsquo;s approach to &#8220;healthy behaviour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who ignored or failed to understand advice about the risks of smoking or benefits of good diet and exercise for heart health would be more likely to be at higher risk, they wrote in a study in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention.</p>

		<p>When do we come to the realization, that despite every effort to educate, that most people will do something that is risky?  You put the facts out there and let people make up their own minds as to what constitutes an acceptable risk.  The nanny state needs to end.  We protect children, the elderly, retarded and  the insane - those who can not protect themselves - everybody else has free choice.</p>

		<p>Did the study control for race? If race was not included in the model, then variation in IQ would capture the variation in race  &mdash;  African-Americans are at higher risk for cardio-vascular disease, while Asian-Americans have a lower risk (but higher risk for GI-related mortality). If no control for race, then the study is probably saying little more than blacks are more likely to have heart disease.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight.  IQ is irrelevant when there are racial differences in it, but it does matter when someone wants to get out of the death house or has heart disease.  </p>

		<p>This study displayed bias in its interpretation of its own findings.  Even after controlling for all factors, including education, BMI, exercise, occupation class, and income, IQ remained as one of only three statistically significant factors.  None of those other factors that I listed remained significant with mutual correction.  It then argued for increased efforts to raise IQ through education, citing Race and Intelligence: Separating Science from Myth.  Here is Amazon&rsquo;s description of that book:</p>
<p>&#8220;They also show that the human species has no &#8216;races&rsquo; in the biological sense (though cultures have a variety of folk concepts of &#8216;race&rsquo;), that there is no single form of intelligence, and that formal education helps individuals to develop a variety of cognitive abilities. Race and Intelligence offers the most comprehensive and definitive response thus far to claims of innate differences in intelligence among races.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Does this perhaps explain why African Americans have a 50% greater chance of having a heart attack than whites? That would mean that African Americans have a 50% greater chance of having a low I.Q.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of the obligitory &#8216;lack of access to healthcare&rsquo; excuse. They live the same distance (or closer) than the doctor&rsquo;s offices than I do, and know exactly how to get to the emergency room. Which is their primary care provider. The rates are actually cheaper for those who have no health insurance, and they get exactly the same treatment as me, a paying patient.</p>
<p><br>
And chronic stress? Don&rsquo;t even get me started.</p>

		<p>Anonymous asked:<br>
&#8220;Did the study control for race?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sample consisted of the 1551-person, 55-year-old cohort of the West of Scotland Twenty-07 study.  After looking at multiple studies based on this cohort, I am led to Medical Research Council Medical Sociology Unit, Working Paper No. 6, 1987 for the full description.  I have not been able to locate a copy of this paper.  However, even though the study does not control for race, this population comes from <a href="/gara0502_web_pdf/Black_20Perspectives_205.pdf" rel="nofollow">Glasgow</a>, Scotland.  This city is 94.5% white.  The 5.5% minority population is half Pakistani and 6% black/African/Caribbean.  Older people in Glasgow are more likely to be white.  Therefore, this was probably overwhelmingly a study of white subjects.<br>

		<p>Professor Linda Gottfredson, whose website is under Links at the &#8220;Welcome&#8221; button at the Amren.com homepage, has written several articles on this.  As she wrote <a href="/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2005BMJrapidresponse.pdf" rel="nofollow"> in one article </a>, that in a large study of patients at two urban hospitals, 26% didn&rsquo;t understand when their next appointment was, and 42% didn&rsquo;t understand the instructions for taking their medicine.  &#8220;Persons who reason and learn poorly practice healthy behaviors less often, seek less preventative care (even when free), know fewer signs and symptoms of disease, and adhere less effectively to treatment regimes.&#8221;</p>
