<h1>Halifax Offers $3M Payout to Former Black Community</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Lightstone, Globe and Mail (Toronto), February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A $3-million payout and a chunk of municipal land are among key parts of an offer city hall has made to compensate the former community of Africville, a meeting in Halifax heard Saturday.</p>
<p>But a show of hands indicating support for the proposed settlement showed the room was essentially divided, said a man who attended the information session.</p>
<p>Some attendees leaving the roughly two-hour meeting criticized the offer, which was presented by an Africville Genealogy Society official and the group&rsquo;s lawyer.</p>
<p>Steve Brown, a former Africville resident, said about 75 people were at the closed meeting, held at a Halifax public library.</p>
<p>When organizers asked for a show of hands accepting the offer, he said about half did so.</p>
<p>Society president Irvine Carvery refused to comment on the city&rsquo;s offer, but he strongly disputed Brown&rsquo;s version of the vote, saying, &#8220;The vast majority of the people put up their hands in favour of the package.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that is the message that will be delivered to Halifax Regional Municipality officials.</p>
<p>Regional council has dealt with the offer in secret but would have to ratify any agreement in open council.</p>
<p>Brown won&rsquo;t endorse the municipality&rsquo;s proposal, which includes an interpretive centre and a church to be constructed as stand-alone buildings, because he doesn&rsquo;t think it is good enough.</p>
<p>He said the parcel of land being offered the historic black community amounts to a little over one hectare.</p>
<p>According to minutes of an April 2007 genealogy society meeting, provided to people at Saturday&rsquo;s compensation review session, roughly 1.6 hectares were being offered then.</p>
<p>Africville was demolished in the 1960s in the name of urban renewal and to make way for a Halifax Harbour bridge.</p>
<p>It is now a national heritage site.</p>
<p>Asked about the proposed $3-million compensation fee, Brown said he understood a substantial portion of that would have to go to the society&rsquo;s lawyer for his 15 years of work on the Africville file.</p>
<p>He also said it&rsquo;s too small a sum, considering the community of Upper Sackville got about $7 million in the 1990s for putting up with the municipal garbage dump for so many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s an offer for the people&#8221; of Africville, said Brown, who was about five years old when his family was moved out of the north-end district, which is now Seaview Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel it&rsquo;s a plan for the city  &mdash;  big time  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a plan for them, not the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Peter Kelly declined comment.</p>
<p>When asked if the Africville offer is an agenda-listed &#8220;legal matter&#8221; that will be part of a closed-door council meeting Tuesday, he said it &#8220;could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor has said he wants to see the issue finally put to bed.<br/>

I will asume that many of these blacks are distant relatives of slaves that escaped to Canada via the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p>Talk about the ungrateful biting the hand that fed them.</p>

		<p>I talked to an &#8216;Afro-NovaScotian woman on the phone once. I was surprised at an underlying tone present of, &#8216;this is our land&rsquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all if posterity proves her right. </p>

		<p>As soon as I read the headline I knew outraged blacks would whine that the $3 million handout was not enough and was in fact an insult.</p>
<p>Never mind that millions of whites have lost their homes and businesses to urban renewal and eminent domain. They only received the alleged market value in return.</p>

		<p>There were extremely few blacks in Canada until the 1960&rsquo;s. Very trivial matters like Africville are blown up ridiculously out of proportion to make hay because of all the blacks now living in Canada. I&rsquo;ve heard Jamaicans living here in Toronto, talk about how much Canada &#8220;owes&#8221; them, because of Africville - if you can believe that! As a group, blacks in Nova Scotia are noted for high levels of crime, violence and welfare, and not much else - just like blacks everywhere.</p>
