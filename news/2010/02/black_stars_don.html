<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35146945/ns/entertainment-movies//">Black Stars Don&rsquo;t Mean Hollywood Is Color-Blind</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Ventre, MSNBC, February 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They are three of the biggest stars in Hollywood. They are also black.</p>
<p>Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Tyler Perry are money machines, although each is unique in operation. As bankable entertainers, there are few who can match them for consistent box-office clout. That probably isn&rsquo;t something that could have been said 20 years ago  &mdash;  or even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Black History Month unfolds, the film industry sees the aforementioned titans standing tall on top of a pile of dough. Washington&rsquo;s recent &#8220;The Book of Eli&#8221; grossed more than $32 million in its opening weekend ending Jan. 17 and has since amassed more than $63 million. Smith is the only actor in history to have eight consecutive films released that grossed more than $100 million each. Perry, a writer-producer-director and playwright, has raked in more than $400 million with his works and is a one-man cottage industry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial consciousness</p>
<p>Yet Kara Keeling, assistant professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California&rsquo;s School of Cinematic Arts, said that, as far as Washington and Smith are concerned, some of their acceptance has to do with their parts.</p>
<p> &#8220;It&rsquo;s important to look at the kinds of roles they&rsquo;re playing and the fact that  &mdash;  with the exception of Tyler Perry  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re playing roles that don&rsquo;t require any sort of racial consciousness,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t bring a racial consciousness to bear on the story in a way that disturbs the audience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington and Smith have carved out extraordinary careers by playing roles that usually aren&rsquo;t race specific, that could conceivably have been played by stars such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Johnny Depp or any number of others.</p>
<p>For every picture like &#8220;American Gangster,&#8221; &#8220;Antwone Fisher&#8221; or &#8220;The Hurricane,&#8221; in which being black is essential to the story, Washington does two or three others like &#8220;Inside Man,&#8221; &#8220;The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,&#8221; &#8220;The Bone Collector&#8221; or &#8220;Man on Fire.&#8221; Smith does even fewer films in which a black character is integral. &#8220;The Pursuit of Happyness&#8221; and &#8220;Ali&#8221; represent two of the exceptions.</p>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s approach is different. He has aimed his work at a predominately black audience and has become hugely successful by tapping into that niche market with such works as the &#8220;Madea&#8221; series of films and &#8220;Why Did I Get Married?&#8221; He also finances his own projects.</p>
<p>That raises another issue when it comes to whether barriers have been broken in Hollywood: Where does the path begin for success in Hollywood by black actors, writers, directors, producers?</p>
<p>In general, the first steps are taken overseas.</p>
<p>Because it is imperative to studio executives and their bottom lines that a film or television show perform well internationally, that often limits the number of opportunities for blacks, primarily because of an old belief that black-themed projects don&rsquo;t do well outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Leah Aldridge, a Ph.D. student at USC&rsquo;s film school who is studying the relationship between international distribution and domestic production in Hollywood, {snip} said Perry doesn&rsquo;t do well internationally, but that his case is unique because he has such an ardent following in the U.S. Washington and Smith, she said, have circumvented the process because &#8220;their brand of blackness does very well in the international markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith is particularly adept at courting foreign money and audiences, she pointed out. &#8220;Will and Jim Lassiter (Smith&rsquo;s producing partner) have been very smart and strategic in identifying which countries are rich for distribution,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They go to India, to China. They meet the local gatekeepers. Will takes the time to go on talk shows and shake hands and create relationships with foreign markets.</p>
<p>{snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tyler Perry is able to do anything he wants,&#8221; said Whipp, the film critic. &#8220;He set up his own studio. He funds his own projects; Lionsgate just distributes them. He seized the machinery. And in the process he has given a lot of African-American actors some plum roles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Perry&rsquo;s projects represent a relatively small portion of Hollywood&rsquo;s output. There are many artists like Mark Harris, a Chicago-based independent filmmaker, who are still struggling to break into the mainstream and tap into its revenue flow.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harris said that black filmmakers need to do their part by coming up with better movies in order to open more doors. &#8220;As black directors, we have to elevate storytelling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to put the blame on Hollywood. We have to make stories that people can relate to.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are great stories coming out of Japan, other Asian countries, Europe, from white directors in America. Many of them are telling really compelling stories. We have a few (quality black filmmakers), but we don&rsquo;t have many.&#8221;</p>
<p>The success achieved by Washington, Smith and Perry, and to a lesser extent (at the box office) by actresses such as Halle Berry, might create the impression that racism no longer exists in the film and television business. That would be a serious error, suggested Aldridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s look at the primetime commercial networks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can you name a sitcom that has a predominately African-American cast on the major networks? There were more black sitcoms in the &rsquo;70s and &rsquo;80s than now. You can also say the same for cable and premium channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hollywood frequently attributes the box-office &#8216;failure&rsquo; of a black film to its black cast and black narrative, hence &#8216;Black doesn&rsquo;t do well in foreign,&rsquo; therefore we must limit the number of black projects and label them as &#8216;high risk&rsquo; ventures,&#8221; Aldridge said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when films like &#8216;New in Town&rsquo; (with Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr.) or &#8216;Surrogates&rsquo; (starring Bruce Willis) are whopping box-office failures, no one in Hollywood attributes it to its white cast. This is indicative of one of the ways racism operates in Hollywood.&#8221;<br>

		<p>White Americans don&rsquo;t even want to watch these black films much less an audience in Europe or Japan.  Why would you want to watch something you can&rsquo;t relate to?  Same with a White watching a Bollywood film or Japanese anime.  The scripts are terrible, the acting is substandard and the dialog at times is ridiculous or poorly translated.  I don&rsquo;t imagine many Africans or Haitians go to movie theatres.   </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the usual &#8220;black&#8221; film theme?  It&rsquo;s &#8220;look how we&rsquo;re abused by white folks!&#8221;.  Today it&rsquo;s a tiresome and basically adolescent story line that has become predictable in black-identity films.  </p>
<p>What the majority of blacks don&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t or simply can&rsquo;t understand is that self-pity is an embarrassment to other races. Sing that song for a few decades, and it will simply become a noise that will deafen anybody with an ounce of emotional maturity and basic reasoning ability.</p>
<p>So films starring blacks who have assimilated into the American culture and who then play roles suited for all audiences isn&rsquo;t good enough for the tribal black PM (poor me) establishment?Pathetic.      </p>

		<p>I am a big fan of CSI Vegas and just loved the character &#8220;Gil Grisom&#8221;, who left the show after nine years.  Then in the trailers of coming shows, they showed the new boss as being a black man.  I was disgusted that once again, they would show a black man as the boss over white people and I cringed at the thought and decided I probably wouldn&rsquo;t watch anymore.  BUT, much to my surprise,. Laurence Fishburn,.. I think is his name, comes across as just another guy, trying to do the best at his job and being the newbie, defers to the others, even though he is a doctor on the show.  This is how it should be,. no attitude, just get along and be personally responsible.</p>

<p>But this is exactly what blacks once said they wanted! They complained about being &#8220;invisible&#8221; in Hollywood! Now that they&rsquo;re only too visible, they find a new complaint. Now they want to be the heros and heroines&hellip;while loudly proclaiming their blackness! </p>
<p>I guess now the ideal movie would be one in which they defeat numerous white &#8220;racists&#8221; and save the world at the same time! Which means that you just can&rsquo;t please these folks. </p>
<p>As far as  the lack of black TV sitcoms, it&rsquo;s one thing for whites to watch a black once in a while in a movie, and quite another for them to watch a black every week on a sitcom  &mdash;  especially if the sitcom is all about &#8220;being black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been said many times before: blacks in Hollywood are never satisfied.  No matter how many race-nonspecific roles actors get, no matter how many racially oriented movies are made, no matter how many black directors are hired, etc., there will be complaints that it&rsquo;s just not enough.  Very young white people, for the most part, don&rsquo;t care whether the hero is black, white, brown, or yellow.  And 1/3 of moviegoers are black.  There are enough wealthy, influential blacks to make all the black movies they want, but many feel like they have to keep up the kvetching or, I suppose, slavery might be reimposed any day now.</p>

		<p>There are a growing number of people who are boycotting any films that have a black in one of the main roles.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, it&rsquo;s an insult to our intelligence to see the depiction of blacks involved in a situation portraying a role that is the exact opposite of reality.</p>
<p>If it were up to us, blacks would be whining about not getting any roles at all except menial ones.  They&rsquo;re disgusting to watch when the viewer is constantly aware that he&rsquo;s watching pure fantasy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;an old belief that black-themed projects don&rsquo;t do well outside of the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an old belief.  it is absolutely true and has been true for the last 50 years at least..  Even Eddy Murphy at the height of his career could not make much of a dent in the foreign market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the entertainment industry all my adult life.  Not on the talent side, the business side, basically tracking box office receipts all over the world.  And believe me, black stars flop even in Mexico, Canada and even in Africa.</p>
<p>No one knows why this is.  But it is very, very true.  Blacks do well in the USA.  But a black as the lead detectives partner or protagonist&rsquo;s best friend can make a movie fail abroad.</p>
<p>As for Tyler Perry, his stuff is just a black version of lifetime made for TV movies.  Denzel Washington is a brown version of John Wayne, same presence, perfect leader, father, strong perfect male authority figure.  </p>

<p>The idea of white people rushing out to see a movie like &#8216;Barber Shop&rsquo; with the racist rapper Ice Cube in it is nothing short of hilarious.  And apparently racist as well.</p>

 A few years ago Will Smith came to  London to promote some film or other he was  starring in, and the crowd greeting him  were  all white. (I didnt see any blacks at all in the publicity pictures.) In fact, I remember  thinking, how ironic, that this had to be the first time since I was a child I had seen so many white people in London  all at once. <br>
 And it took a black man  to do it. </p>
<p>  But hey, nobody worships a black  quite like my idiot countrymen.   </p>

<p>It has become like a game to me, as and when  the token  black will pop up and  show himself  in some  historic  role totally unsuited  to them. I recently watched the remake of &#8220;Jason and the Argonauts&#8221;  and And lo and behold it  turned out to be &#8216;our own&rsquo;  Adrian Lester, a British born black who, unlike most  Amercian blacks, who at least can act,  often comes across as bit of wood with only  one or two expressions. But in our country he  seems to appear in everything  where a token is needed. I believe they  recently remade a Tennessee Williams  play with an all black cast and the sycophantic  theatre critics were eagerly giving him the five star thumbs up all the way.   In Jason he plays &#8216;Orpheus&rsquo;.   </p>

<p>I agree with many of the comments here, but just gotta say, I like Will Smith.  He&rsquo;s maybe the only black I would invite to my fantasy-celebrity dinner party.  It&rsquo;s sad, but I suspect that if other blacks were more like him, our racial problems would be fairly minor.<br>

		<p>I have to say that I am ashamed that black stars are sooo popular here! Will Smith? He is very smart and does everything right,as the aticle says. He works hard,does the requisite publicity,never acts the fool in real life;but still I cant stand him. Denzel is a very good actor,as is Fishburne. I like them both. But again  &mdash;  everything in the USA is worshipping BLACKS!! Black black blackitty black! Enough a&rsquo;ready!</p>

		<p>The only black actors I thought were any good were Denzel W. and morgan freeman.  Mybe that guy from Tuskegee Airmen also.  I also think most white actors are not great either, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I do agree with many posters here that most black movies I&rsquo;ve seen advertised just don&rsquo;t interest me.  I have no desire to see films about hip hop, dancing and gangsta thugs (or movies like precious).  I like movies with a real plot - movies that keep you guessing and have some finesse or hidden meaning. (Bourne Identity, the Firm, etc) It&rsquo;s hard for directors to produce those, and even harder for blacks given their lack of experience in doing this.</p>
<p>I do not believe that black directors should be given some special help to break into this business.  No one else gets any special help.  Sure, there is the &#8220;who you know&#8221; network, but that is no substitute for natural talent, and real talent equals money which opens doors by itself.  Besides, people make movies for specific audiences.  Some make chick flicks to appeal to women.  So since black directors make amovies about black people, that is their audience.  White directors make movies for both black and whites.  Can&rsquo;t black directors make &#8216;white&rsquo; movies also?</p>

		<p>My favorite black film star is Morgan Freeman, simply because he doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;do black.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very good actor whose race is purely incidental to his roles. He never exudes black menace of grievance, at least within those films I&rsquo;m familiar with.</p>

Slavery has been imposed again. Just not on blacks. If you pay taxes, you are a financial slave, especially if you are white. The blacks should be happy. Whites are now the slaves.</p>

<p>While you are learning to spell at a fifth grade level, you might consider grammer and punctuation, too. The above is a run-on sentence. It should read:<br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue what black (or white) actors are doing nowadays. I don&rsquo;t waste my money or my time. When the stars of the screen are the special effects, along with some obscenely overpaid narccisitic mental cases obsessed by their imagined importance, Hollywood has nothing for me. </p>

		<p>There is not a single movie theater in Jackson, Mississippi.  The only theatres in the Metro are at safe distances from areas with significant black populations.  This is because of black behavior in such venues.  Vicksburg&rsquo;s last theatre closed a few years back, precisely because few, black or white, were eager to be subjected to the misbehavior of black youths. I&rsquo;d imagine this holds true for most cities.  Theatre owners seem desperate to AVOID black patrons.</p>
<p>That means that for a great many blacks, there are no theatres within easy reach.  Surely, this would affect the box-office receipts for black-themed films.  I&rsquo;m sure that DVD figures are another story, and that blacks consume such movies when they come out on cable (they ALL seem to have cable&hellip;).</p>
<p>But box-office figures seem to be all-important to the money men of the movies.  And the whites who patronize the new Cineplexes of the distant suburbs, as posters have made clear, aren&rsquo;t interested in Black &#8216;Themes&rsquo;.  Bruce Willis type roles are all that&rsquo;s left for black men to play.  So why is Mr. Ventre complaining?</p>

		<p>Blacks are always getting the racist thinking applied to them in Hollywood. It is an extension of a plantaion and slavery, that white KOOKs like to pretend never ended.</p>
<p>Now go watch Rocky, and pretend a white guy and beat a Black CHAMP!</p>

		<p>Speaking of Morgan Freeman: the fact that he can do no wrong, that he always and only portrays a paragon of virtue indicates that Hollywood is saturated with racism   &mdash;   reverse racism in which blacks must be everything good and whites&hellip;well, we know what whites must be.</p>

&#8220;My favorite black film star is Morgan Freeman, simply because he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;do black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very good actor whose race is purely incidental to his roles. He never exudes black menace of grievance, at least within those films I&rsquo;m familiar with.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how they act on screen.  This is Hollywood pushing multiculturalism and diversity down our collective throats.  Watching more of these kinds of films only encourages more of them.  I&rsquo;d say about 65% of movies have at least one minority lead in them and that number will only go up if we encourage it. I&rsquo;m almost completely turned off from going to the movies anymore.  Black movies in particular seem to be very heavy with the vulgar language or the ebonics is so heavy and flowing you need English subtitles to understand what they&rsquo;re saying.    <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s just fine with me.  In ten years, maybe less, when this country breaks apart, we Whites will go our own way and you blacks can go yours and build your own separate nation.  I&rsquo;m sure such a proud, industrious and intelligent race such as yours can survive without our tax dollars.  <br>
