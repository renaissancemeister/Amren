<h1>Is Hollywood or Vanity Fair the Problem?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Prince, Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vanity Fair&rsquo;s February issue features Tiger Woods looking, some said, like a thug in prison. In 2008, another Annie Liebovitz cover showed NBA star LeBron James hustling both a ball and Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen in what to some looked like an homage to King Kong and Fay Wray.</p>
<p>The new March issue  &mdash;  the Hollywood issue  &mdash;  features a bevy of starlets, all of them white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously folks,&#8221; blogger Tambay Obenson wrote Monday on the Shadow &amp; Act Web site, &#8220;as we&rsquo;ve already discussed quite a bit on this blog, where are all the young non-white actresses (and actors) with star potential who should be on this cover? Black? Latino? Asian? Etc? Surely, they could have located even one woman of color for the issue. Did they even try? All rhetorical questions, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. really!&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanity Fair spokeswoman Beth Kseniak told Journal-isms:</p>
<p>&#8220;Vanity Fair&rsquo;s Hollywood cover has always been a reflection of Hollywood and the industry. Generally, as is the case this year, it&rsquo;s made up of young actresses who already have a few films to their credit and will be appearing in more movies in the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gil Robertson IV, who founded the African American Film Critics Association, said via e-mail, &#8220;I really can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m shocked, but I am a little startled as to how VF couldn&rsquo;t include Zoe Saldana who had lead roles in 2 of the biggest films of the past year  &mdash;  &#8216;Star Trek,&rsquo; and &#8216;Avatar&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are certainly other African American actress like Paula Patton and Nicole Beharie, with current film profiles that equal many of the girls on this cover. It&rsquo;s another reflection of our culture&rsquo;s ongoing problem with race and racism. VF is supposed to be cutting-edge, but this cover shows no forward movement  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s sadly just more of the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Morales said being on the cover of Vanity Fair &#8220;can do wonders for any new actress.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Has a White ever appeared on the cover of ebony, jet or other similar magazine? If not I wonder if those complaining in this article have made similar complaints to the other magazines? Sometimes I wonder what non Whites would do if they didn&rsquo;t have this kind of petty stuff to complain about.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;The new March issue &mdash; the Hollywood issue &mdash; features a bevy of starlets, all of them white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I think the aptly titled magazine &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; is simply reflecting what would be considered their perfect world on this March&rsquo;s cover. It is filled with rich and attractive white people, all of whom are likely witlessly Marxist. It is their typical fantasy model of what &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; for them and their fellow elitist &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; should be, as opposed to the reality that they wish to &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; the rest of us with.</p>
<p>To their credit, all of the women photographed above are in a rainbow assortment of gowns!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t expect a white model on the cover of Jet.  Or Ebony. Or the &#8220;African American Film Critics Association&#8221; newsletter.  </p>
<p>If you do not like Vanity Fair&rsquo;s content, don&rsquo;t buy the magazine.  Seems simple to me.</p>

		<p>The striking thing about black folks is that when they&rsquo;re absent, you don&rsquo;t miss them at all, or even notice that they&rsquo;re not there.  All you see is nine attractive young women.  Nothing is missing.</p>
<p>Whites may not be supreme, but we truly are sufficient. </p>

		<p>This troubled woman is either enamoured with the mental affliction called love of diversity or she&rsquo;s been so brainwashed and propagandized all her life she couldn&rsquo;t think objectively if she had to.  But, on second thought, her unnatural inclination could also reveal the possibility that she&rsquo;s trying to please her plantation owners by making it known her preferences are just like theirs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s those things like this and people like her who make me glad that this circus is rapidly reaching critical mass.  </p>

		<p>Blacks have such serious image issues. The Tiger Woods cover shows him shirtless while lifting weights. It can only be seen as a portrayal of a prison thug if the person perceiving it to be as such already sees Blacks in that light. Any person complaining about such a benign picture is admitting to their prejudices. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no pleasing Blacks. They have their own publications where Whites are virtually excluded, yet have the nerve to wail over Whites being displayed in a magazine owned by Whites and read mostly by Whites. </p>

		<p>Come to think of it I can&rsquo;t think of any famous young nonwhite actresses.  All the usual rehashes like Halle Berry are racking up quite a bit of mileage on them.  Two probable reasons are lack of acting talent and low demand.  Look at those beauties in the picture above.  Would you rather pay money to watch the newest cosmetically altered mulatto in a wig or one of these knockouts?  Hollywood is hurting as it is.  Even an honest black would have to admit that Zoe Saldana would be way out of her league in a group like that.  She&rsquo;s very unattractive and has that whole AIDS look going against her.  </p>

		<p>As a person of Southern European descent, I could play the &#8220;Why not us?&#8221; game as well, since none of the women in this picture are of Southern European descent (why not Lea Michele? lol), but I&rsquo;ll pass.  Instead, I salute Vanity Fair for showing backbone by publishing such a provocative photo in these dangerous, multi-cult times.</p>
<p>Why does EVERY such photo in a newspaper or magazine HAVE to show non-Whites? This photo is refreshing, and the bevy of beauties are quite pleasing to the eye.  Joanna Douglas is nothing but a shill and a sell-out.  I&rsquo;d call her a few other adjectives, but then I&rsquo;d violate AmRen&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vanity Fair may have been looking for the most promising batch of talent for their issue, but they should have been looking for a diverse group of women as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why?  That comment ranks up there with Spike Lee&rsquo;s comment to Clint Eastwood: &#8220;Cultural sensitivity is more important than historical accuracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shall purchase this issue of Vanity Fair, as well as sending them an e-mail applauding their good taste.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really wondering why anyone thinks they have a &#8220;right&#8221; to interfere with anyone&rsquo;s free expression and free association.  Where on earth did this idea come from?  Marxists, I guess, but I don&rsquo;t know.  The twisted minds of liberal (Marxist light) thinking?  It really does get old reading about this stuff day after day here on this site.</p>

		<p>Maybe someone can tell me how much diversity there might be on the cover of Jet, or Ebony, or Sports Illustrated, or any number of other magazines. Not only is diversity not a strength in this country, it is also not mandatory.</p>
<p>(Just as an aside, I notice much more diversity at the Miss America pagent, than was ever the case at the Miss Black America competition.)</p>

		<p>Implicit in all of these twittery rants is the presumption that for each and every group, X percentage of all faces <i>must</i> be black.  No one <i>ever</i> says exactly <i>why</i> this should be so, probably because it&rsquo;s considered proof of Vile Racism even to ask.</p>
<p>As for Zoe Saldana, well, she had a small part as Lieutenant Uhura in the new (and intensely mediocre, IMO) <i>Star Trek</i> film, and did the voice for a blue-skinned alien in <i>Avatar</i>.  I suppose that, given the usual lowered standards for &#8220;Persons of Colour,&#8221; that makes her a major star.  As for the other two black actresses cited, well, I confess I&rsquo;ve never even heard of them   &mdash;   which no doubt makes <i>me</i> a Vile Racist, too.</p>
<p>Although I wouldn&rsquo;t waste a dime on <i>Vanity Fair</i>, I&rsquo;ve got to admit that that photo spread looks awfully good to me.<br>

		<p>There has to be something mentally wrong with somebody who concerns herself with race so much.</p>
<p>Out of the other side of her mouth she maintains we should all look beyond race and see the person.</p>
<p>Liberalism is indeed a mental disorder, but it is just as much an agenda of the more dim-witted people in this society.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been said before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: white women are more beautiful than black women (all else being equal).  This is why men of all races prefer white women if they can get them.  To Tambay I say, &#8220;let&rsquo;s make a deal.  When 50% of white/black couplings involve white men and black women, at that point we&rsquo;ll consider the possibility that black women are as attractive as white women.&#8221;  As a matter of fact, I think I&rsquo;ll post this on his blog if comments are allowed.</p>

		<p>The reoccurring theme I have noticed is the beautiful white female and black male combination. More recently someone pointed out Wal-Mart&rsquo;s ads including blond-haired white white women with black babies. </p>

		<p>It seems that VF doesn&rsquo;t find black women any more attractive than Tiger Woods.    Beauty is not necessarily in the eye of the beholder.  Black women are frequently, if not always, as unattractive as their vile behavior.</p>

		<p>I like the VF spread.  It&rsquo;s beautiful without having Halle Berry/Mariah Carey types with dyed blonde hair, light colored contacts, and nose jobs.  Who wants to see fake whitewashed mulattoes when one wants to see the real thing, i.e. White women.  Yes, I&rsquo;m black and I just don&rsquo;t understand blacks wanting to invade every white periodical and shows. Why can&rsquo;t White people celebrate themselves?  Must every single show and ad had to have a Black or a mulatto in it all the time?  </p>
<p>Again, the VF spread is awesome!</p>

<p>Thank you for the links (I guess); they&rsquo;re sickening. You&rsquo;re right; you really do have to see them to believe them. It&rsquo;s especially jarring for those who&rsquo;ve chosen to not own a television (like me- for the last 25 years). On those rare occasions when I do happen to be around a television, it seems like nothing but blacks, blacks, and more blacks. Garbage. Just like Wal-Mart.</p>

		<p>Normally I avoid fashion magazines, but what a treat to see a group of only white women. Not one token. I wonder how that sneaked by the political correctness department. Even some European travel websites have to have &#8220;people of color&#8221; on their homepages. &#8220;See how enlightened we are.&#8221; Pathetic.</p>
<p>Those Walmart photos are shocking! What you will never see, of course, is a black woman with a white baby; they can&rsquo;t have them!</p>
<p>Here in San Francisco, there is an epidemic of mixed Chinese and White babies (always Chinese mothers, of course) who end up looking sort of Mexican. Very depressing. We really are in danger of disappearing. Too bad our beautiful features are recessive.</p>

<p>If whites aren&rsquo;t moving in the direction dictated by afrovoodoos, then its proof of racism. If we aren&rsquo;t moving forward toward afrovoodoo tyranny, then we are all supposed to feel sad.</p>
<p>Whites are not supposed to be allowed to look at a picture of 100% beautiful white woman, because it might ignite an awareness of the terrible White Pride, which is the worst scourge and pestilence on the planet.</p>
<p>Whites are no longer supposed to enjoy anything of their own, if they are caught, the must admit to being &#8220;sad&#8221; about not having &#8220;passionately embracing the diversity that makes us stronger&#8221;. </p>
<p>School children are being taught that if they don&rsquo;t admire and surround themselves with blacks, then they are racists. That&rsquo;s why home schooling will be made illegal. <br>

		<p>Everyone knows quotas are truly racist.  To all the non-whites out there:  Get over the fact you are not white.  Get over the fact you can never be white.  Get over the fact you have to live your life for yourself, and understand you are NORMAL for being what you are.  What sets you aside looking foolish is trying to be white, take what is not yours, and being a part of white culture when you are not of white culture.  Be proud of what you are and make a stand for your kind in YOUR world of culture.  The more non-white pressure against the whites causes anger and hatred towards you.  Stop the pushing and the struggle is over.  Continue the rage and everything only gets worse.  This time I am polite.  Next time I won&rsquo;t be.               </p>

How could those terrible awful racists at Vanity Fair have ignored the breakout actress of the year, Gabourey Sidibe, who plays an illiterate incest victim in the current movie &#8220;Precious&#8221;? </p>

		<p>Walmarx is clearly promoting some white female black male race mixing. Which should be shocking to any one who believes in individual liberty and freedom from propaganda. It should also be shocking to any white racialist, such as the majority of amren readers. Also shocking and offensive to black women, because clearly walmart seems to insinuate that black women are not good enough for black males and wants to displace them from relationship with black males. This is especially hurtful to the black community since many black families do not have an active participating black father. Further, from what I understand, many black women already have a hard time finding a husband, this only makes their situation worse. It goes to show how this supposed P.C. garbage offends not only white racialists but also further damages the very minorities, in this case blacks, it supposed to help.</p>
<p>If white racialist, black women, and other blacks that care about black family integrety do not boycott Walmarx, then they are all a bunch of phoney hipocrates complicit in their own genocide.</p>

&#8220;The striking thing about black folks is that when they&rsquo;re absent, you don&rsquo;t miss them at all, or even notice that they&rsquo;re not there. All you see is nine attractive young women. Nothing is missing.</p>
<p>Whites may not be supreme, but we truly are sufficient. &#8220;</p>
<p>  For tens of thousands of years Europeans lived happy lives without being aware of the existance of blacks. The media has given up the impression that there cannot be White societies without blacks.Many nations in Eastern Europe hardly have black people. Millions of Asians have never seen black people and they live complete lives. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Implicit in all of these twittery rants is the presumption that for each and every group, X percentage of all faces must be black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. I&rsquo;ve noticed that virtually EVERY tv commerical, every ad MUST have at least one Black in it. Yes, there are some very attractive Black women but so what. Why can&rsquo;t a publication ever have all White faces? There are pleny of magazines that cater only to Blacks or Latinas that have only Black or Latina faces. I don&rsquo;t care. </p>

		<p>This site occasionally brings up an article about White women being overrepresented in the world of supermodels and such, or about lighter skin being a sign of superiority and beauty among women in some third-world country.</p>
<p>But consider this: lighter skinned women are universally appreciated because within every race, the female is slightly lighter skinned than the male. Black women are lighter skinned than black men, Asian women lighter skinned than men, and so on. This has been proven.<br>
So light skin is an universal symbol of femininity. Conversely, darker skin is an universal symbol of masculinity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in Europe, North European women often fantasize about dark-haired South European men, and South European men fantasize about blonde North European women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there is a strong stereotype of the black-haired romantic heroes, and blonde heroine. And you get dark haired male men and blonde women in movies and such. It&rsquo;s hardwired in the way we perceive the world.</p>
<p>We should keep all this in mind when before we pride ourselves for having the most beautiful women, and conversely, complain that the media pairs blonde women with non-white males.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Seriously folks,&rdquo; blogger Tambay Obenson wrote Monday on the Shadow &amp; Act Web site, &ldquo;as we&rsquo;ve already discussed quite a bit on this blog, where are all the young non-white actresses (and actors) with star potential who should be on this cover? Black? Latino? Asian? Etc? Surely, they could have located even one woman of color for the issue. Did they even try? All rhetorical questions, but &hellip; I mean &hellip; really!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Says who? some blogger nobody? Just who are you to tell a successful magazine (of which there are fewer and fewer)what should be on their cover? Nobody tells youwhat to do with your blog..because no knew it exists.Go Vanity Fair&hellip;we Whites do not need different racial groups to verify us.  We by ourselves doing what we like without hurting anybody are just fine without minorities.<br>
Ahem ..er notice that the setting is a europeam motiff..not a brightly colored kente cloth or dishkas. Just as it is ridiculous to put kente cloth on a White woman in an African setting it is just as ridiclous to put other races in an european setting. </p>

		<p>Notice how the color scheme of this photo is mostly what Western society has long referred to as flesh tones.  A darker woman in the group, regardless of her beauty, might have disrupted the overall look of the piece.  <br>
It&rsquo;s been stated a million times already, but I&rsquo;ll repeat it.  If blacks want to be valued as individuals, they have to stop racial witch hunts against whites.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the link to the Wal Mart ads. You certainly see a lot of white women with black kids at Wal Mart but NONE of them look like the model in the first ad with whoever&rsquo;s kid that may be. The second model looks a bit like the mom of a mulatto but still much more attractive than the reality. The funny thing is the kid in the second ad isn&rsquo;t even mixed. Must be a Haitian orphan.</p>
<p>As for the topic of the article, there are no upcoming young black stars because for the most part very few blacks can act. Back before PC, the blacks who made it on screen very definitely had serious acting talent. In the affirmative action age, blacks who make it on screen are complete jokes as far as talent and they ruin whatever scene they may be in because the are cast as some sort of important status figure, which magnifies the inadequacy of their acting skills.</p>
<p>A lot of old TV shows from the 60s are now available online free of charge. I was watching an episode of the Twilight Zone the other night and the sophistication of the writing and the acting was so superior to anything on television today it made me question whether we are still on the same planet, let alone in the same culture. The decline in our culture borders on the criminal when you are able to do a direct A-B comparison. And dumbing down for diversity is the main culprit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So light skin is an universal symbol of femininity. Conversely, darker skin is an universal symbol of masculinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so in India and other South Asian countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan etc&hellip;). Here fairness is preferred in men too. Most Indian women prefer fair or as we say men with a &#8216;wheatish&rsquo; skin tone. Most Indian women would rather marry a fair man than a dark man. Women here are attracted to &#8216;Tail, Fair and Handsome&rsquo; men. There is a big market for fairness creams for men in South Asia.</p>

		<p>I think I may be the only person whos sensibilities would fall under &#8220;WN&#8221;, who is not happy with this cover and actually agrees with the diversity mongerers&hellip; allow me to explain:</p>
<p>I see this as an establishment magazine peddling strictly white women to a very diverse world. It is precisely this type of concentration on the white female that is the reason for countries like China and India to lust after and thus import white women into their media; White women posing and dancing with Asian males in Asian media (and without a doubt &#8220;mingling&#8221; with them afterwards). </p>
<p>To be honest I was actually surprised to not find on this cover Zoe Saldana, the rather attractive black actress who has been taking Hollywood by storm in the hit movies Star Trek and (in particular) Avatar.   </p>
<p>If establishment Western media was to concentrate more on brown or Asian women, brown and Asian countries might hopefully be more eager to import them and then maybe keep their paws off ours! </p>
<p>Why do I feel this way? For one, in my opinion, the sex of the performer has much to do with it; if a male oriented magazine was to release a cover with up and coming male actors, I somehow doubt all the men would be white. However since most up and coming actors right now ARE all white, I therefore do not see such a magazine cover existing; the whole world does not want to see white men. To the whole world (the &#8220;rest&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;West&#8221;), white men bad, white women good.. give them to us!</p>
<p>And thats just me focusing this on a global scale. Lets not forget, the West is quite diverse (unfortunately), so this is also the Establishments way of peddling only white women to our own diverse countries! Minority men see magazines show only white women, so minority men want white women more. </p>
<p>I am sure some of you may disagree with me on this for the reason that the world may want white women because of their natural beauty and not for the attention our media draws to them. But I do feel that media exposure could play a part. Focus more on minority women, and perhaps minority men might leave ours alone. Perhaps. Its just my theory which I feel like sticking to. </p>
<p>Anyone getting my drift on this? Thoughts? I know mine are something of a dissent from the usual AmRen mindset but I actually very much wanted to point this out on here from the very moment I saw this cover&hellip; even before it became a controversy (which I knew it would!)! </p>

		<p>There were no non-white starlets available because they were all at home waiting for their welfare checks; just like during Katrina. Or maybe they are all in class at Harvard or Princeton. They wouldn&rsquo;t have to work in school where everything is paid for and all the work done for them, but they probably would have to work or at least get up early if they were acting.</p>

<p>I agree with you to an extent but as a WN myself, I&rsquo;m really sick of seeing Whites as always having to have an orbit of nonwhite faces around them in the media, advertisements, commercials, etc.  I am not attracted to women of any other race and I do not think it is normal for someone to be attracted to someone outside their race. It is also healthy and normal for blacks to find White appearances to be repulsive and alien.  Something has interfered with these natural thought processes, whether it&rsquo;s the media or low self-esteem, I don&rsquo;t know.  It doesn&rsquo;t help our White women to be publicly condemning black women as the ugliest females on the planet.  Keep it to yourself.  In fact you would probably be doing your race a service by complementing these women on their appearance and boosting their self-esteem.  This is why Halle Berry was nominated as the most beautiful actress in Hollywood or the Miss America Pageant chooses a black every year.  The next time your in KFC and there&rsquo;s an obese black woman in front of you ordering three large popcorn chicken, a breast meal, crispy chicken sandwich, two orders of fries and a diet pepsi, don&rsquo;t think sarcastic thoughts.  Throw out a compliment.  Mimic some of that conversation you hear black guys talk at work.  Say &#8220;girl what you need with that diet pepsi&#8221;?  &#8220;You all skin and bones&#8221;.  &#8220;I like a lil push in the tush&#8221;.  Then when you&rsquo;ve got her smiling and falling all over herself, buy her a complimentary bucket of chicken on your way out the door.</p>

<p>What an arrogant attitude, born of jealousy.</p>
<p>Why should non-White actresses be featured in a magazine marketed to Whites?</p>
<p>Of course, to those of her ilk, pointing out hypocrisy or questioning why Whites shouldn&rsquo;t be featured prominently in Jet or Ebony constitutes racist hate speech.</p>
<p>As for walmart:</p>
<p><br>
I am not surprised to see Walmarx (Great Name!  Mind if I steal it?) promoting ads showing White women with black babies  &mdash;  after all, a black baby is the new ultimate accessory for &#8216;progressive&rsquo; White women, something to show off to their friends like a pedigreed dog or designer dress used to evoke envy.  They get to prove their &#8216;cred&rsquo; as truly altruistic, a-racist, humanistic, one-world, enlightened beings, light years above racist, republican proles. </p>
<p>Walmart is playing into this latest fad  &mdash;  their bottom line is money.</p>
<p>How many foolish Whites are falling all over themselves to adopt Haitian babies?  Their heroes and role models are Madonna and Angelina Jolie who set the example, proclaiming they &#8216;don&rsquo;t see race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a few years we&rsquo;ll be reading news reports of these &#8216;cute&rsquo; Haitian babies adopted by naive Whites becoming what their DNA has in store for them  &mdash;  violent, impulsive, low IQ&rsquo;d, aggressive teenagers marked by school failure, a surly attitude and hostile intentions toward their White benefactors.  The White adoptive parents will be asking themselves:  &#8216;Where did we go wrong?&rsquo; without understanding that DNA-guided brain size and hormone levels over-ride environment.<br>
 <br>
How many will end up murdering their White adoptive parents?</p>
<p>Make sure you read the bottom of the back pages of the newspapers, which is where these type of &#8216;adoption gone wrong&rsquo; stories will be buried, if they&rsquo;re printed at all.</p>
<p>For another take on Walmart:</p>
