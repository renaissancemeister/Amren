<h1><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/07/2812378.htm">Burqa-Clad Robbers Hold Up Post Office</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Australian Broacasting Corporation, February 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two burqa-wearing robbers have held up a French post office using a handgun concealed beneath an Islamic-style full veil, court officials said.</p>
<p>Officials said postal office staff let the pair through the security double doors of the banking branch near Paris, believing them to be veil-wearing Muslim women.</p>
<p>Once inside, the pair flipped back their head coverings and pulled out a gun.</p>
<p>They made off with 4,500 euros ($7,100) seized from the staff and customers of the branch in Athis Mons, just south of Paris, according to the online edition of Le Parisien newspaper.</p>
<p>Police have opened an investigation.</p>
<p>France is seeking to restrict use of the head-to-toe Islamic veil on the grounds it is incompatible with French values, after a parliament report called for a ban in schools, hospitals, government offices and public transport.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s right-wing party has already presented a bill to make it illegal for anyone to cover their faces in public on security grounds.</p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy has declared the burqa &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in secular France and favours legislation to outlaw it, though he has warned against stigmatising Muslims.</p>
<p>According to the interior ministry, only around 1,900 women wear the burqa in France, which is home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority.<br>

		<p>They could easily have been Muslim women, not just men dressed as women.  Muslim women have been increasingly used by terrorist groups in attacks, so it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if Muslim women were committing violent crime in France.</p>

<p>Wait until they have more frequent open conflicts like the veicle burnings.  The piles of clothing will be used to smuggle weapons to different locations.  In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it has already occurred.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer country.  It&rsquo;s payback to the elites who invited them into the country in the first place.</p>

		<p>Quite obviously this alleged &#8220;robbery&#8221; is in reality an Islamophobic plot by the French govt to make it easier for them to push through their anti-Burqa pogrom&hellip;er, program.</p>

		<p>Interesting that this was not found on a French news source. Apparently only those in Australia consider it noteworthy.</p>

		<p>There have been a number of cases like this in England as well as these sinsiter dark robes having allowed a wanted (male) terrorist to evade capture and  thus escape to his country of origin.  Multiculture means disaster after  disaster and  ultimately social breakdown. </p>

		<p>A person in a burqa or hijab, robbed a bank in North Carolina. Appears to be an effective tool for a bank robbery. Multiculturalism is so accepted in america, you wouldn&rsquo;t be looked at twice wearing one of these. It&rsquo;s the perfect disguise.</p>

		<p>This is why, in the USA, many liquor and convenience stores will post signs forbidding the wearing of masks on Halloween, when entering those establishments.</p>
<p>Of course, France also doesn&rsquo;t have the Second Amendment.</p>

		<p>Dang - and here I thought the Aussies had gone and deported all those Muslims in their nation!!  I guess it&rsquo;s kind of like termites - you think you&rsquo;ve got &#8216;em all and out of nowhere a new swarm appears.  And - wow - did you know that termites are responsible for fully 20% of the world&rsquo;s methane??  YUP - it&rsquo;s true - I have the article on my refrigerator, entitled &#8220;Termite Flatulence.&#8221;  Straight out of Newsweek magazine.  And I guess that tells you in what esteem I hold the Muslims&hellip;.</p>

<p>Exactly right. In most locales [USA], wearing a mask in public is against the law unless it is worn as part of a gala event. Such as Halloween or a fancy costume ball. Entering a liquor store on Halloween wearing a mask would not be such a good idea, however, with that I agree. Bang, bang, shoot-em-up, your dead.</p>
