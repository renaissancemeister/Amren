<h1>How to Reach Affluent African Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Dolliver, Adweek, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} A forthcoming book, titled Black Is the New Green: Marketing to Affluent African Americans, makes the case that luxury marketers are guilty of missing out on one such lucrative market. Written by Leonard Burnett Jr. (co-CEO and group publisher of Uptown Media Group and Vibe Lifestyle Network) and Andrea Hoffman (CEO of consultancy Diversity Affluence), the book also offers counsel on how to go about reaching &#8220;AAAs,&#8221; its shorthand term for &#8220;affluent African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slated for publication in March via Palgrave Macmillan, the book says many luxury brands appear oblivious to the fact there&rsquo;s any such thing as an AAA audience, even though such households now deploy some $87 billion in disposable income. With the image in their heads of a handful of wealthy black athletes and entertainers, these marketers overlook the existence of 340,000-plus AAA households  &mdash;  headed by professionals, corporate executives, entrepreneurs and the like  &mdash;  with yearly income of at least $150,000.</p>
<p>But there are also, as the book notes, brands that have been savvy enough to go after AAAs, though not savvy enough to do it well. One problem is that marketers often seem to adopt a hip-hop approach as their default mode in addressing black consumers, irrespective of the age or social class of the audience they&rsquo;re hoping to reach. Sure, interest in hip-hop has broadened over the years. &#8220;However, the reality is that the vast majority of the significant affluent African American niche is not part of hip-hop culture,&#8221; the book explains.</p>
<p>THEIR TASTES HAVE MATURED</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly just a function of AAAs&rsquo; age: &#8220;They are no longer 18 to 34 years old,&#8221; says the book, &#8220;but 28 to 44 years old.&#8221; It ought not to surprise anyone that they&rsquo;ve outgrown some of the interests they had in their younger, less-prosperous days. {snip} That brand &#8220;might have made a better choice in terms of reaching the AAA audience by choosing to employ an image of Halle Berry, or Phylicia Rashad, or even an undiscovered black model from Africa in their ads  &mdash;  in other words, choosing someone who registers on the AAA radar, someone who inspires their aspirations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many marketers have allowed themselves to be misled by the sheer tonnage of media attention to hip-hop and urban style. &#8220;Continual media references to urban and hip-hop have created a one-dimensional vantage point which overshadowed this market,&#8221; says Hoffman in an interview via e-mail with Adweek. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The simple passage of time means the civil rights campaigns of the 1950s and &rsquo;60s feel remote for many AAAs. Says Hoffman: &#8220;It&rsquo;s important to note that AAAs were birthed out of a generation where race barriers were lower than in their parents&rsquo; or grandparents&rsquo; time.&#8221;</p>
<p>BEYOND THE CIVIL-RIGHTS STRUGGLE</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If a marketer ties a disproportionate amount of its marketing to events like Black History Month and Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s birthday, it risks being out of sync with the AAA audience. &#8220;If you are McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s probably part of a larger effort that simply stands out during celebratory times,&#8221; says Hoffman. &#8220;However, as luxury brands begin to embark on or ramp up their efforts, their touch points might be very different. Occasions do have a place in the hearts and minds of African Americans as a whole, but what differentiates the AAA audience is that while they respect and value their legacy and heritage, they are not constrained by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luxury marketers can tap into AAAs&rsquo; civic concerns, of course, but it helps to do so in an up-to-date manner. The book points to environmentalism as a case in point. It&rsquo;s a cause with added resonance for community-minded AAAs, since struggling black neighborhoods are often situated in areas that bear the brunt of pollution. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;AAAs, like any affluent audience, are keenly aware of environmental issues, not only in underserved communities but across the globe. According to some very preliminary research, the broader opportunity exists from food brands and cleaning supplies to baby products and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>INCLUDING ETHNIC MEDIA</p>
<p>{snip} When it comes to choosing media for a campaign that targets AAAs, the book cautions against adopting the following assumption: &#8220;Oh, this is just another kind of luxury client. We&rsquo;ll be able to reach them with our general marketing because, once people get to a certain level of wealth, they assimilate.&#8221; While agreeing &#8220;AAAs may have more in common with what you view as your core customer base than you originally thought,&#8221; this doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve ceased to have a distinct identity. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [T]his audience &#8220;notices when the luxury brands that fill the pages of Vogue and Vanity Fair are absent from ethnic media.&#8221; And they&rsquo;ll take this as a telltale sign of whether an advertiser truly is &#8220;welcoming&#8221; of them.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;If a brand feels that they have the wrong creative  &mdash;  meaning no black person in the ad  &mdash;  they aren&rsquo;t operating off research,&#8221; says Hoffman. &#8220;Our research shows that this consumer is also OK with quality creative as long as it&rsquo;s found in the targeted media, marketing and lifestyle outlets that are relevant to AAAs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WORD TRAVELS FAST</p>
<p>If AAAs suspect a brand isn&rsquo;t authentically welcoming of them, they&rsquo;ll let their peers know about it. The book notes that the AAA audience is &#8220;a tightly knit one.&#8221; And that means word travels rapidly among them: {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s one of the things that make this audience so special,&#8221; says Hoffman. &#8220;Grassroots and word-of-mouth marketing are highly relevant. Recommendations from peers who had good experiences are worth gold. It&rsquo;s free advertising. Brands who aren&rsquo;t participating in this are leaving money on the table. This is where involvement in the digital space, or events and partnerships with organizations such as the National Black MBA Association, are critical and should be standard components to any marketing mix.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoffman also quotes some recent research by her Diversity Affluence firm that points to the online aspect of this: &#8220;Affluent African Americans do not just shop online but use it often for information, entertainment and communications. Of growing importance to Affluent African Americans is online networking. More than 82 percent of respondents subscribe to personal networking sites such as Facebook.com and to a slightly lesser degree (72 percent) Affluent African Americans use online social networking sites such as LinkedIn.com. Such sites are budding opportunities for personal and direct marketing to this unique group.&#8221;</p>
<p>SMALL EVENTS, BIG IMPACT</p>
<p>This propensity for spreading the word means small-scale events can have a big impact. {snip}</p>
<p>This, too, reflects a recurring theme in the book, that partnerships with cultural institutions (as well as educational and philanthropic organizations) are an effective way for brands to align themselves with the interests of AAAs and get their attention in a positive way. {snip}</p>

		<p>If the total market of black AAA consumers totals just $87 billion in a $14 trillion dollar economy, it&rsquo;s hardly worth targeting such a tiny segment. At $150,000+ per potential customer, that means the whole market is made up of less than 70,000 persons, or households. A large part of this group would already buy the luxury goods promoted because of the perceived quality they offer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if luxury good advertisers emphasise a black target market in their ads, they might well alienate a far more valuable segment, namely the white middle classes. This segment may well see the offered goods as having negative connotations as well, giving the propensity of many minority groups to choose ostentation over substance and dignified elegance. </p>
<p>No doubt the firms selling luxury goods have weighed up these factors more objectively than the self-styled progressivist Mark Dolliver.  </p>

		<p>Hip-hop marketing goes as much  &mdash;  or more  &mdash;  to youthful whites than blacks, since there are, numerically, more whites into the genre.  More mature middle-class, as well as affluent blacks, like much the same things as whites and other ethnic groups do.  </p>

		<p>My African American aquaintences who have made it to economic success have a few things in common. They all have Salvadorean maids, Lexus cars,and their kids in the best private schools money can buy. They do not live in fear of profiling cops but from black thugs.They even seem to be lightening up skin-wise.I do not know a single affluent black whose child went to a predominately black college. They feel guilty for being so white so they still go to black churches, serve on the church boards,and kick in plenty of money. They know the ugly truth about black success,if they fall from grace they fall all the way down because they have no safety net of associates.This is why they really work hard to cultivate white friends, knowing 90% of all other blacks hate their guts.<br>

		<p>I would imagine that john #2 is fairly correct about how to market to high end blacks. However, you probably have to split your marketing between the athletes &amp; entertainers and those who are engaged in more academically demanding areas. Athletes/entertainers tend to get a free pass from the black community, whereas the other group is probably viewed as the ultimate traitors. The a/e group also has a much higher turnover rate than the second group that moves into the AAA category. Not too long ago, I heard Magic Johnson on the radio hawking some rent to own chain. Were he still alive, you could just imagine the hatred if Sir Arthur Lewis (the first black to win a Nobel prize in economics - 1979) pitched some item. </p>
<p>Even though I attended a high school that was 75% black, I felt sorry for that small group of black students (usually 5 - 8 per grade) who had the ability to do reasonably well in the college prep/honors classes. I can think of about 6 who graduated with me. Our school even had a black principal who while he wasn&rsquo;t the sharpest tool in the shed, he took away the ability of the blacks to constantly complain racism. He was also over 6 ft and 300 lbs and not averse to knocking heads when necessary. </p>
<p>Their parents were certainly no better off than the white parents who didn&rsquo;t have the ability to bail out of that situation through moving or private schools. I&rsquo;m sure that back in the hood or the projects, they had to do things to show that they were &#8220;keeping it real&#8221;. There was one black female on our school&rsquo;s debate team and I can just imagine the grief she got for hanging with the white students. Needless to say, I would imagine that the day they arrived at college was probably the happiest of their lives. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where most of them are now, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a few of them were included in this category. Yes, they have to do whatever it takes to remain gainfully employed because they have violated the &#8220;crab bucket&#8221; rule and their own will destroy them if given the opportunity. Rae Carruth probably would get more love than the man who worked his way through medical school. </p>
