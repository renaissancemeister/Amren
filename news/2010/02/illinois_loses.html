			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Greiner, NBC Chicago, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With help from GOP Senate nominee Mark Kirk, Illinois could go red in 2010.</p>
<p>Or Alexi Giannoulias could help the Prairie State stay blue.</p>
<p>But one color is sure to change: Black.</p>
<p>Two white candidates are now competing for a senate seat that has been held by a black politician for 11 of the last 17 years.</p>
<p>Carol Mosely Braun occupied the seat between 1993 and 1999. Barack Obama held it between 2004 and 2008, and Roland Burris took it over in 2009.</p>
<p>If Harold Ford Jr. doesn&rsquo;t win his primary fight against Kirsten Gillibrand in New York  &mdash;  Ford is polling behind the upstate Democrat  &mdash;  the United States Senate will once again be peopled entirely by anglo-saxon men and women.</p>

<p>And we should be horrified by this&hellip;because?</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, what&rsquo;s this &#8220;African-american senate seat&#8221; business?  Have we finally sunk to the point at which certain seats in the senate are explicitly reserved for &#8220;politicians of colour?&#8221;</p>
<p>Note to Andrew Greiner, whoever he may be: Senate seats belong to whoever wins them.  There are no &#8220;African-american senate seats.&#8221;  Yet.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Charles Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin, Al Franken, Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez qualify as Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re gonna get most of Roland Burris&rsquo;s extremist agenda in some crucial areas in either Mark Kirk or Alexi Giannoulias.  I won&rsquo;t be voting for either one, or even the third party candidate (the only 3rd Party in IL are the Greens) if I&rsquo;m living in the state in November. </p>
<p>Oh, and memo to everyone involved:  It&rsquo;s not the black seat, it&rsquo;s not the Obama seat, it&rsquo;s the people&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>What a moron of a reporter this Andrew Greiner! And what morons his copy editors. That last time I checked, Anglo-Saxon was a proper noun/adjective. We capitalize Bantu here at Amren.  </p>

<p>Well, Black-O-Rama now holds a position that has been White since 1789 when it was first held by George Washington. Does that disqualify him? Unfortunately, the answer is no.</p>

		<p>Happily 2010 may mark the end of the Black elected politician in America.  Blacks tried and as usual failed because there isn&rsquo;t any Affirmative Action in politics.  Maybe in 1000 years Blacks can try again.  </p>

		<p>Greiner also forgot Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who is no Anglo-Saxon, but Polish. It&rsquo;s very stupid of Greiner who thinks that all Caucasians are &#8220;WASPs&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the writer is so desperate for Bantus in power, why doesn&rsquo;t he suggest Colin Powell, Harold Ford Jr., and other Amrican Bantus take over Haiti&rsquo;s government. Not only would these guys lord over people whose skin pigmentation is the same as theirs, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have to really do much at all.</p>
<p>While on the subject of Haiti, I saw an article on MSN, where some Haitian parents actually GAVE THEIR OWN CHILDREN (my emphasis) to those American Baptist &#8220;missionaries&#8221; because they could no longer provide for, and parent them! Do you believe it? Could you imagine Japanese or Chinese parents surrendering their children to whites, following an earthquake, because they could no longer provide for them?</p>
<p>Haitians are bereft of any racial pride whatsoever.</p>

		<p>No doubt, if Jesse Jackson Jr. was not in deep doodoo over the Blago mess, he would had ran for the Obama seat.  As it presently stands (fortunately) no black democrat is running which means that this is one less congressional black caucus member to contend with.</p>

<p>Im not so sure about that.  While I agree in theory as to what you are saying, and am a strong supporter of states rights, which is exactly what that advocates, the problem lies in the fact that within about 2-3 terms, we will have at least 15-20 black senators, and about 8-10 hispanic ones as well.  Appointed, via white guilt, from a &#8220;fairness&#8221; point of view.  You will then have an entire section of the senate, perhaps as much as 50%, employed through affirmative action.  Not sure I want that.  At large elections, will keep that possibility to a minimum anyway.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Anglo-saxon&rsquo; is indeed a synonym for &#8216;white&rsquo; which is meant to be a derogatory epithet. It is used after they&rsquo;ve said &#8220;white&#8221; too many times in an article and &#8216;wasp&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t the exacly correct term.<br>
What if they said the senate will consist of a majority of <i>European-Americans</i>?<br>
No, because that acknowledges us as a legitimate ethnic group, a status which we are now denied.</p>

		<p>Good, a 100% white congress that will keep selling our country out to the unearned diversity privilege and give the amnesty and vote to illegal non whites. Our job, as freeborn White American Citizens, will be to ensure that this 100% white congress personally lives with the consequences of what they do to us. </p>
<p>No private schools.<br>
No private communities.<br>
No private country clubs.<br>
No private doctors.<br>
No 100% white grandchildren.</p>
<p>If they destroy us, the should not be allowed to protect themselves from that which they used against us.</p>
<p>If they force diversity upon us, we must force them upon diversity, and vice versa.</p>

		<p>What difference does it make if the Senate is 100% white when not one of those whites votes the interests of whites and surely would never dare openly espouse white interests? Is there a single senator advocating severe restrictions on immigration or the elimination of quotas? Case closed. </p>
