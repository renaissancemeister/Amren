<h1>Racism, Anti-Immigrant Sentiment, White Nationalism and Islamophobia, Is This the GOP&rsquo;s Future?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Imagine 2050, February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 37th annual Conservative Political Action Conference kicked off today in Washington DC. This year&rsquo;s event is featuring big players in the conservative movement, but more concerning, the extreme right are also prominent. During my first eight hours at the event I heard examples of Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, anti-Semitism and some flat out racist and extremist comments coming from both speakers and attendees.</p>
<p>The first session I attended was entitled &#8220;Student Activist Workshop&#8221; was sponsored by the Leadership Institute and the Alliance Defense Fund, a group that defends students freedom on college campuses. {snip} As the discussion came to an end, the main speaker, Jordan Lorence of the Alliance Defense Fund, finished his remarks with a bizarre Islamophobic rant  &mdash;  warning students that if they aren&rsquo;t careful the United States will be taken over by Muslims like Western Europe has. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Instead of using his allotted time to rant about immigrants, J.D. Hayworth instead attacked his opponent in the upcoming Senate race, John McCain. Hayworth did bring up immigration at the end of the panel discussion when Chad McDonald, Director of Social Media Marketing for the anti-immigrant organization NumbersUSA asked a question directly to Hayworth about the border. Hayworth said something to the affect of &#8220;our borders are about as secure as we are close to finding another galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I headed over to the main ballroom to see a very interesting speech by house minority leader John Boehner. {snip} After leaving this event I ran into Hannah Giles and the now infamous James O&rsquo;Keefe, who was arrested recently for attempting to wiretap Sen. Landrieu&rsquo;s phone. After his arrest, reports surfaced about O&rsquo;Keefe attending a white nationalist forum in 2006, featuring Jared Taylor, the head of white nationalist organization American Renaissance. {snip}</p>
<p>The final workshop of the evening I attended was perhaps the most disturbing. It was a screening of the film Border War which looks at immigration on the southern United Sates border. J.D. Hayworth introduced the film in which he plays a major role before promptly leaving as the movie started. About 5 minutes in the film showed some undocumented immigrants attempting to cross the border. As this scene went on, a man sitting to my left said &#8220;shoot them&#8221; loud enough for the people around him to hear. Instead of eliciting condemnation or shock, the other attendees merely continued to watch the film. If this had happened just once I would have given the other attendees the benefit of the doubt of not hearing him, but the man went on to say it two more times during the film!</p>

		<p>Now THIS sounds like an organization I could support!  Who wrote this piece?  His/her attitude is despicable - with such people in control, our country would very soon cease to be free, cease to foster excellence, and produce the mediocrity that would soon reduce us to 3rd world status.  I LIKE the GOP that was reported on in this article, and I hope it&rsquo;s accurate!!</p>

		<p>What the cheerleaders of diversity don&rsquo;t seem to know is that most of their followers only pay it lip service.  If you observe the behavior of White Liberals it is almost like that of &#8220;racists.&#8221;  They live in majority White communities, go to majority White schools and mostly date and breed with other White people.</p>
<p>The main difference is that &#8220;racists&#8221; don&rsquo;t preach soft genocide of White people or give money directly to non-White causes.  (Taxation is an indirect way that everybody gives money to non-White causes.)</p>
<p>As corporate media loses it&rsquo;s hold on the public mind, more and more Whites of all political persuations will begin to question the corporate approved lie of equalty.</p>
<p>Once they begin to question it, it won&rsquo;t be long before the gravy train to non-Whites gets shut down for good.</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;..hearing that gives me real hope for the future and makes me think the republicans might be worth another shot&hellip;..if the &#8220;tea party&#8221; movement manages to change the republican party into a nationalist movement rather than being taken over by neocons.</p>
<p>I think the vast majority of americans want us to &#8220;shoot them&#8221; as they try to cross the border.  More to the point, we want a militarization of our border and illegal immigration reduced to zero.  We want at least 20 million illegals, and perhaps as many as 40 million illegals rounded up and forcibly deported.  We want 100% (of the roughly 50% of all immigrants) removed from welfare and told to leave if they can&rsquo;t support themselves.</p>
<p>That is the minimum it would take to restabilize the US and avoid a civil war.  And it will come to civil war.  Not a struggle for our federal system like the first one was but rather a dissolution of our federal system and the break up of the US along racial lines.</p>
<p>We will witness the birth of the ethno-state. I can&rsquo;t stress enoughthat it will become all important, where you live.  The difference betweem freedom and prosperity vs being ethnically cleansed. </p>

		<p>Was the GOP being racist when it elected Michael Steele, a black man, to be chairman of the Stupid Party &mdash; err&hellip; excuse me &mdash; the Republican Party shortly after Obama was elected?</p>
<p>Was the GOP being anti-immigrant when George W. Bush adamantly and stubbornly tried to pass amnesty for 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 illegal aliens in America? Was the GOP being anti-immigrant when it nominated candidate John McCain, a militant proponent of amnesty for illegals, to run for president against Obama?</p>
<p>Was the GOP being white nationalist in its support for a legal, open borders immigration policy that will lead to whites becomming a minority in a matter of decades? Many Republican elites have embraced the idea, always repeating the tiresome cliche that America is &#8220;a nation of immigrants&#8221; to dishonestly justify an insane open borders policy.</p>
<p>Was the GOP being Islamophobic when George W. Bush continuously repeated that Islam is &#8220;the religion of peace&#8221; in his attempt to appease moderate Muslims by making himself appear tolerant towards their religion?</p>
<p>Clearly, the author of this dishonest article has been living under a rock.</p>

		<p>I read the full article because I wanted to see why the author referred to CPAC as an &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; event.</p>
<p>The reason? The NRA was there!</p>
<p>And their leader is Wayne LaPierre.</p>
<p>Mr. LaPierre allegedly had an article published in the American Free Press magazine.</p>
<p>The magazine was previously known as The Spotlight.</p>
<p>And since the Spotlight sometimes printed anti-Jewish articles, that proves CPAC is anti-semitic! </p>

		<p>Chris Simcox, one of the founders of the Minutemen, was running in Arizona for Senate against McCain.  But he recently dropped out, I suspect due to lack of funds.  Anyhow he&rsquo;s endorsed J.D. Hayworth, who has spoken out strongly against illegal immigration.  So while I may have some differences with Hayworth, he has to be better than pro-illegal immigration John McCain, a man who infamously said that Americans wouldn&rsquo;t pick lettuce for $50 an hour.</p>
<p>The left wing press (including the left wing internet press) is always warning us about the racists in the Republican Party, a party that never fails to sell middle class white people down the river when that suits its corporate overlords.  Meanwhile I never hear the leftists complain about Al Sharpton&rsquo;s good standing in the Democratic Party, or about Farrakhan&rsquo;s endorsement of Obama.  Of course the Democrats are delighted to have Hispanic advocates of Atzlan in organizations like La Raza and MEChA on their side.  Anti-white racists have long been welcome among the Democrats.</p>
<p>I believe the reference to &#8220;2050&#8221; in the name of that web site is for when white people become a minority in the country overall (unfortunately that&rsquo;s probably about 10 years later than the actual event).  The white haters of that web site are looking forward to the day.</p>

		<p>Republicans are not supporters of  Freedom loving patriotic Americans and never have been since big business took them over in 1896.They want immigration to keep scaring the working man from joining unions.Most cement heads think Union guys are socialists; nothing is farther from the truth.They are gun carrying voters whose kids fill up the all-volunteer army where you won`t find many rich republican kids. Ask any Union Coal miner how he feels about immigration.He would be the first guy shouting shoot him. The republicans created this continual hemorage of our Scots-Irish seed corn that they watch like a video game all the while getting richer and making certain their banks keep robbing us all.These creeps booed Ron Paul because he`s against the blood letting and immigration deluge.<br>

<p>Perhaps this dunder-head should go to France, Germany, or the U.K. and see if there is any truth to the man&rsquo;s statements.  I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.  These multi-CULTs are so far gone nothing short of a bullet would open there eyes.  Which is exactly what they might get if they went to Western Europe.</p>

		<p>#7, I personally favor splitting the US along racial lines rather than trying to reclaim the whole country. I don&rsquo;t see us having the moral right to deport black Americans who have lived here for centuries, nor could we ever remove the indigenous people of this country. And even if we cracked down on Latino illegals, there still would be too many legals and anchor babies. It&rsquo;s better for us whites to relocate to white-dominant areas like the Midwest and/or the Rockies. And by just making those regions white we will put them on the road to autonomy and ultimately secession. As Arthur Kemp said, it&rsquo;s all a number game. </p>

		<p>Putting it in reverse: The Party which advocates and supports open borders, multi-culti-diversity and political correctness at the cost of fairness&hellip; is the party I could NEVER vote for. Draw your own conclusions!</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding &#8220;racist&#8221;, I believe Americans need to maintain our own culture; not dilute it by admitting an African, a Oriental, a Latino for each White American. Nor do I accept the idiotic premise we Americans are required to perpetually prop up and support third-world people around the globe with OUR hard-earned tax dollars. Nor provide a safety valve for Mexico&rsquo;s overpopulation and perennial poverty problems.</p>

		<p>That Imagine 2050 site is a sick joke.</p>
<p>Go check out the &#8220;about&#8221; page of the site. Every single person mentioned as part of the team appears to be white. They&rsquo;re a group of over-educated white dopes wasting their time &#8220;imagining&#8221; a future when they and their children will have significantly less power and will have to face a multicultural American Nightmare of balkanized racial groups fighting over fewer and fewer crumbs of the pie.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be excited and want to promote such a future? </p>

		<p>So this was one big Nazi convention with the Grand Dragon himself, Grover Norquist and his fellow skinheads formulating a plan for an illegal alien amnesty? How bizarre.  Sounds to me like our alien overlords are using the liberal media to entice us back into the fold of the controlled opposition with this White Nationalist wet dream.     </p>
