<h1>Utah House Panel OKs Constitutional Amendment to End Affirmative Action</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Vanderhooft, Salt Lake Tribune, February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The House Business and Labor Committee voted along party lines Friday to support a proposed amendment to Utah Constitution&rsquo;s barring the state from discrimination or preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.</p>
<p>Ward Connerly, a former member of the California Board of Regents who has worked to pass similar laws and constitutional amendments in California, Washington, Michigan and currently Arizona, is backing the amendment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats accused the bill&rsquo;s sponsor, Rep. Curtis Oda, R-Clearfield, of failing to seek input from community and minority leaders before bringing it to the committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Representative, it is awful. To pull this bill out two days ago and ram it down the throats of this community, is awful,&#8221; Rep. Jackie Biskupski, D-Salt Lake City, told Oda. &#8220;This is big, and it deserves public input.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oda said Biskupski&rsquo;s accusations were &#8220;improper,&#8221; before noting that the bill would have to be approved by two-thirds of both the House and the Senate before going to voters in November, allowing for plenty of time to comment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measure now heads to the full House, where the GOP Caucus, which holds 53 of 75 seats, broke out in applause when the proposed amendment was presented Thursday.</p>
<p>If approved by 50 votes or more in the House, the measure will proceed to the Senate, where Republicans have 21 of 29 seats.</p>
<p>Senate President Michael Waddoups, R-Taylorsville, predicted HJR24 would clear the Senate with relative ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest problem is the quota system at the universities,&#8221; Waddoups said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not getting necessarily the most qualified students there because of it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is only tangentially about the article above, but did you see the story on Yahoo! news about the happiest states in the country:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzwb43x" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzwb43x</a></p>
<p>The top 10 states and their average well-being scores (out of a possible 100 points):</p>
<p>    * Hawaii: 70.2<br>
    * Utah: 68.3<br>
    * Montana: 68.3<br>
    * Minnesota: 67.8<br>
    * Iowa: 67.6<br>
    * Vermont: 67.4<br>
    * Colorado: 67.3<br>
    * Alaska: 67.3<br>
    * North Dakota: 67.3<br>
    * Kansas: 67.2</p>
<p>The article discusses some characteristics the states have in common, but miss the measure in which Kansas has the highest rate (among the ten) at 5.7%, while Montana and Vermont are two of the four lowest in the country at 0.3% and 0.5%. [National Average = 13%]<br>

		<p> In a state as conservative as Utah, do these Democrats really think that seeking input from the people would have brought anything but a resounding &#8220;YES!&#8221; to this proposed amendment? And as to &#8220;reaching out&#8221; to minorities, of course THEY want affirmative action; they&rsquo;re the ones who benefit from it, at the expense of White people.</p>

		<p>Hmm. Eliminate affirmative action in all job applicants, housing applicants, and university admissions?</p>
<p>Even though not a Mormon, sounds like Utah is going to be getting an influx of the &#8216;right kind of people&rsquo; if this passes. And a lot of the &#8216;wrong kind of people&rsquo; are going to be naturally disenfranchised, which is as it should be. Social engineering didn&rsquo;t work in the USSR, why think it would work here? After sixty years, didn&rsquo;t we JUST LEARN that &#8216;Head Start&rsquo; was a complete FAILURE? We did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking up job prospects in Utah right away. &#8220;My kind of town, that Provo is&hellip;.&#8221;<br>
(sung to the tune, My kind of town, Chicago is&hellip; a la Frank Sinatra)</p>

		<p>When forced integration was being forced upon the South, did anybody bother to get input from white parents?  Leftists are the least principled of anybody, when it comes to advancing their agendas - yet they are the first to cry foul when things don&rsquo;t go their way.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve always felt that if we could simply get equality in every aspect of the goverment we would combined with smaller goverment rise to the top.</p>
