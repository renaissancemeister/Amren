<h1>New Conservative Club to Host Prominent Conservative Politician at MSU</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSU Sons of Liberty, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For Immediate Release:<br>
February 8, 2010<br>
Jordan Zammit<br>
Founder and President,<br>
MSU Sons of Liberty<br>
MSUSonsOfLiberty@gmail.com</p>
<p>East Lansing, Mich.  &mdash;  The newly established and registered student organization at Michigan State University, the Sons of Liberty, will host Nick Griffin as a speaker from noon to 1:30 p.m. on February 18, 2010, to discuss how the fraud of man-made global warming is used by liberals to attack the sovereignty of nation-states. Griffin is the chairman of the British National Party  &mdash;  the fourth largest and fastest growing political party in the United Kingdom  &mdash;  and he is an elected parliamentarian of the European Parliament and current candidate for the U.K. Parliament.</p>
<p>Michigan State University will be Griffin&rsquo;s first public event; he will also speak at Kenyon College in Gambier, OH, at the American Renaissance conference in Washington, D.C., and he is expected to make an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C., as well.</p>
<p>Griffin is no stranger to MSU, for on October 28, 2008, Griffin was hosted by the now defunct chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom and attempted to deliver a speech on the threat of Islam and mass immigration. During the event, left-wing agitators attempted to drown out his message by shouting him down and by pulling fire alarms after beating an effigy of him outside. Immediately following his speech, a mob of armed leftists attacked people sympathetic with Griffin&rsquo;s message with baseball bats, sticks, and canes (https://statenews.com/index.php/article/2007/10/police_brief_103007). The event was briefly covered on FOX New&rsquo;s The Hannity &amp; Colmes Show.</p>
<p>Jordan Zammit, a political science/pre-law freshman and founder and president of the Sons of Liberty, said, &#8220;It is an honor to host a distinguished speaker like Nick Griffin. His views will greatly contribute to the marketplace of ideas which is a fundamental aspect of a collegiate education.&#8221; The Sons of Liberty was named after the secretive pre-Revolutionary War group of American patriots  &mdash;  including Paul Revere, Patrick Henry, John Hancock, and John and Samuel Adams  &mdash;  who advocated for freedom and sovereignty.<br>

<p>Well, that is some interesting news!</p>
<p>While I figured that Mr. Griffin was a candidate for the British Parliament, I did not realize that the BNP had become the fourth largest party in that country. No wonder the vile multicultural establishment in the UK, is simply crazed with the goal of destroying the party. I really do hope that he gets that seat in parliament; it will send seismic waves of confused horror through the UK&rsquo;s arrogantly diversity obsessed &ldquo;elites,&rdquo; and the aftershocks of it will be felt across the entire white and English speaking world.</p>
<p>Even here in the USA, it will be felt because England is our mother country. In our early adolescence as a colony of hers we may have rebelled and achieved independent adulthood, but we have never fully lost our affection for that mother over here. </p>
<p>Well, that is unless you are a deranged or freakish multicultural troglodyte.  </p>
<p>Next, is this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately following his speech, a mob of armed leftists attacked people sympathetic with Griffin&rsquo;s message with baseball bats, sticks, and canes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, the Reds demonstrated their &ldquo;intellectual superiority&rdquo; over the &ldquo;hateful fascists,&rdquo; that they claim to only want to teach &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; to. Seriously, there is no greater example of why, once in power in any country in the West, the political right should mercilessly defeat known Marxists, if/when they do achieve that power. Traitors and idiots are worthless, that is an undisputed axiom of history.</p>
<p>How much worse are they, when they ruthlessly brainwash young fools into becoming their Red thugs and diabolically frenzy them to the point that they attack normal people like packs of feral animals?</p>
<p>What more to say?</p>

		<p> Why is the YAF chapter at MSU &#8220;now defunct&#8221;? Were the hooligans who disrupted Griffin&rsquo;s speech and beat his supporters ever arrested and prosecuted? And how does the new Sons of Liberty organization   &mdash;   a great choice of names, in my opinion   &mdash;   know the same things won&rsquo;t happen to them, too?</p>
<p> As long as conservatives keep acting as helpless victims to these leftist thugs, and complacent college administrators turn a blind eye to such outrages and refuse to call in the police, these disruptions will continue. A word to the wise is sufficient, young Sons of Liberty: You&rsquo;ll have to stand up for yourselves and do whatever it takes to assure that your speakers are heard, and not shouted down and intimidated.</p>

		<p>I can be very caustic and cynical at times, I know this; that is, even when I am trying for humor lately.</p>
<p>However, recently I feel an unexpected joy at what the BNP and other rationally motivated political parties are doing in our homelands!</p>
<p>We must work as hard as we can, for a political solution to our racial problems. If we can facilitate, in any way the destruction of the Neo Cons, and see the Republicans lose the white majority they currently enjoy, we should do it. The misnamed Paleocons are our allies and have been abused since 1992 by those filthy Red infestations that was exemplified by the &ldquo;Bush Administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think about it, seriously; if we could only get an American BNP or split the &ldquo;2 Party&rdquo; abomination soon enough, we might just save this country.</p>
<p>Think very hard about that my good people and friends,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Right-Wing Hero:  I just watched that YouTube video of Griffin at MSU and was amazed and appalled by it.  Griffin appears to be an incredibly brave individual, able to maintain his composure amidst the senseless badgering going on in that room.  I look forward to hopefully seeing him speak in less than 2 weeks.  The most sickening part of that video for me (and probably many other AmRenners that watched it), was when that pathetic White girl squawked that &#8220;we all started as the same color, so why don&rsquo;t we end as one&#8221;.  I literally felt like throwing up.  It makes me believe further something that I feared.  As a young man in his early 20s, I am a rarity indeed in my White nationalist views.  The majority of my generation has been irreparably brainwashed by PC.  My allies seem to be largely from the ranks of elder generations.  That leads me to conclude that we must fight and take a stand, soon.  Time is certainly running out.  </p>

		<p>Dear John PM,</p>
<p>    Have you heard of the American Third Position Party? I just heard about it recently. They seek to find a political solution to our problems. Google American Third Position Party and their website should come up first. The differences between Britain and the US seem odd to me.  In Britain whites have far less freedom of speech yet they are more open to banding together politically. In the US we have more freedom of speech yet whites in the US seem more reluctant.  Perhaps we&rsquo;ve been subjected to propaganda concerning slavery and civil rights for a longer period of time. In any event I would love to see the American Third Position Party prosper.  <br>

<p>What happened here is &#8220;his&#8221;(Griffin&rsquo;s) right to free speech was interrupted by &#8220;their&#8221; (L.U.G.&rsquo;s*) right to free speech.  The respect of &#8220;his&#8221; right to free speech, was denied by &#8220;their&#8221; right to free speech.  Truely sad of &#8220;them&#8221; for not letting him speak.  Has there ever been a speech, not a lecture, but a speech, given by ANYBODY, on a college campus, or some place close to, that didn&rsquo;t take questions at the end, a refutal??  To paraphrase Mrs. Obama&hellip; I have never been so ashamed at the youth of this country!</p>

		<p> Cheers to this young student Jordan Zammit&hellip;To Nick Griffin..To Michigin state university for behaving honorably&hellip; Something that used to be admired in this country before it got highjacked into being land of the misfits and home of the huddled swine. Throughout the history of the world ..all people have exploited their neighbors at times and competed in order to survive. The track record of humanity is both beautiful and tragic everywhere. The fact that we exist seems to bare witness that human life has thus far justfied its existence. There are many perceptions on what makes life worth living. One of the more universal attributes of life beyond {motion}.. is {growth*}. This growth&hellip; is what I think best represents what the white race means to the world. Yes.. there were diseases spread.. there were injustices perpetrated&hellip;but as I said these ugly things are strange to no part of the human condition&hellip; but again&hellip; Who.. has led the world out of servitude to nature.. in order to more fully unfold the human potential?.. who more than the European race? And This.. is why the world is torn between wanting to punish the whites for stealing fire from the gods..(waking humanity up) and conversely coveting their genetics out of envy*. Thus&hellip;I think the reason for Amren and this particular public event as well as the planned following ones&hellip;is a just effort to defend and preserve the European nations/ human type who specifically had this great contribution to the whole world. The huddled masses have used orgies of white guilt to extort whites out of their unique birth right long enough, its time to turn on the light of sober truth and no longer feed this imposter of justice. Tolerance of diversity should tolerate the preservation of the white race, along with the others&hellip;</p>

		<p>I give support to this one student at MSU.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to many of these type of college speaking events presented by &#8220;Conservatives&#8221;, where Leftist go in and shout down, break up the event.</p>
<p>The fault is with Conservatives who just don&rsquo;t know how to handle disturbances or know how to handle much of anything.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to prevent your speaker from being driven away, shouted down.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>1) Have a dress code - same as American Renaissance conferences.</p>
<p>Anarchist Leftists aren&rsquo;t going to go to all the trouble of wearing a suit and tie, nice dress for the ladies and then scream, shout down and if they do, well at least you got them to clean up for an hour or so and can claim a great victory.</p>
<p>2) Sell tickets, reserve seating - works with rock concerts.</p>
<p>3) Hire motor cycle club of working class Whites to handle security. It worked great at Rolling Stones Concert in California &#8216;69.</p>
<p>Working class Whites are generally quite happy to mix it up with idiot, spoilt rich Lefty college students. Give our lads some fun recreation.</p>

		<p>So the BNP has officially eclipsed the Greens at this point?  I didn&rsquo;t think that was the case.  I know they have more councillors and so on than the fake UKIP party, but I thought the Greens outnumbered them.</p>
<p>@5) I&rsquo;m a white male just into my twenties as well and all I can say is that you&rsquo;re hanging out with the wrong crowd.  Most of the people I know are &#8220;racist&#8221;(recognize racial differences, even if they won&rsquo;t admit it).  I don&rsquo;t hang out with skinhead neo-nazi trash either(not saying all skinhead neo-nazis are trash mind you, stereotyping is bad, remember!).</p>
<p>Probably because we&rsquo;re all poor and are actually forced to be around blacks and mestizos on a daily basis.  It&rsquo;s easy to be a race denying white liberal when you can afford to put up a massive economically based wall between you and non-whites.  It&rsquo;s a lot harder when you&rsquo;re living right next to the bloody barbarians.</p>

__   __   __   __  </p>
<p>Yes, you are a rarity, but  be a little gentler on your generation.  A lot of us here were once brainwashed too, and it took us a while to come around. But we did.   Generally, it took real life experience to &#8220;un-teach&#8221; us what had been indoctrinated in the classroom and via the movies and TV. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that anybody is &#8220;irreparably&#8221; brainwashed.  With intelligence and the ability to think for themselves, everybody is redeemable. For some, it will be a very painful shock to realize how they&rsquo;ve been duped, and then have to change all their values.  You are to be commended that you have learned so quickly and so young.  Having wised up to reality so early will save you a lot of pain later.</p>

		<p>#11 Anonymous: Are you from the South? That could explain a lot.  I grew up on Eastern Long Island and was only awoken due to nearly being killed by a Black in the once-great State of Pennsylvania.  Almost all (maybe 2 or 3 exceptions) the young people I know from the North are either super-diversity flameballing libs or so disinterested they don&rsquo;t even have a view on the subject.  As I said in another post, exposure is a key and that is why the North has a much longer way to go than does the South.  </p>
<p>Thank you for commending me BROWSER, and perhaps I was a bit excessive with the word &#8220;irreparably&#8221;.  Peoples minds can be changed.</p>

<p>Well, if it makes you and the other posters on this site feel any better, I too am a young man in his 20s who recognizes that there are real and meaningful differences between the races. And I happen to be from New England to boot!! (I&rsquo;m assuming that &#8220;Gen. Lee&#8221; is a Southerner.) Now with the Internet, whites really don&rsquo;t have any good excuses for not knowing all the compelling evidence supporting a genetic component to racial differences in average IQ and other traits.</p>

		<p>Actually, the BNP are NOT the fourth largest party in the UK. It actually doesn&rsquo;t even have a seat in our Commons. </p>
<p>It is below the DUP, SNP, Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru, Social Democratic and Labour party, Respect Coalition, UKIP, Ulster Unionist Party, and even got less results that the Green Party.</p>
<p>In reality, it is a very minor party here. </p>

		<p>Anybody else here ever look longingly at Monocultural countries like South Korea or Japan and envy them? They have the attitude that this is their land for their people, religion, and culture, and while they might tolerate other races for business reasons foreigners cannot get citizenship. Although Japan committed atrocities such as Germany nobody criticizes them for their decision to be monocultural.</p>
<p>The fact is that the white race is the fastest depleting people on earth, if we don&rsquo;t get a monocultural homeland for whites only, I fear we will soon be history. That really would be a tragedy. </p>
<p>I wonder if we all (from around the world) like minded white nationalist moved to say Poland and could have enough political influence to stop immigration and have a White monocultural country for our own, and our children&hellip; </p>

		<p>Ted asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear John PM,</p>
<p>Have you heard of the American Third Position Party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed I have Ted, and I too wish them nothing but success. Interestingly, James Edwards is on its board of directors and I have a great deal of respect for him. I often listen to his radio show and he is a very clear thinker when it comes to this county&rsquo;s racial and political problems. He is an energetic young man, with a passion to save our race in this country that matches his energy. I don&rsquo;t agree with him on all issues, to be certain; however, there is enough that he is correct about, that I do admit if he were to run in a national campaign, I would vote for him.</p>
<p>How can you not like a man who just interviewed Jared Taylor very recently, and did so without a trace of maudlin bias or multicultural sanctimony?</p>
<p>All the best to you Ted,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Dear Amren friends, for those of you who believe in the power of prayer, please pray that God always protect Nick Griffin from evil and danger, and that the Holy Spirit fill Mr. Griffin with wisdom, strength, courage and peace of mind.  Please especially pray for him around the time of his speech on February 18th!  Thank you and God bless you.</p>

		<p>&#8216;&hellip;was when that pathetic White girl squawked that &#8216;we all started as the same color, so why don&rsquo;t we end as one&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You can scream back at her:  We Will End Up As One Color:  RED!  And it will either be the blood of our murders or RED as in Soviet Red and Communist China Red. </p>
<p>Squelching Free Speech is an old Soviet tactic, straight from alinsky&rsquo;s handbook.  Pathetic idiots who scream marxist slogans of &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; to further the aims of their masters are nothing but useful idiots!  They&rsquo;ll be the first eliminated when the &#8216;Revolution&rsquo; is completed.  They&rsquo;re too stupid/brainwashed to know they&rsquo;re merely pawns doing the bidding of their Red masters (probably professors).</p>
<p>The pathetic White girl, having no clue as to what she&rsquo;s doing, will end up behind a burka, hauled off to a gulag never to be seen again or with a bullet in the back of her head if she tried any of that &#8216;shouting down&rsquo; tactic with the new Red Kommissars.  If we become what she believes is best for all of us, these things will happen to her anyway.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we over study the Holocaust and lose the lessons of Soviet-enforced equality  &mdash;   non-existent in the US educational system  We are told we should always be on the lookout for White Nazis and extremists, or so says our AG and director of HS, but Soviets?  NYET!  Nazis were brutal but the Soviets made them look like a Sunday School picnic!</p>
<p>Was Joe McCarthy the last politician alive to understand this?</p>
<p>Murder totals:</p>
<p>61,911,000   Murdered: The Soviet Gulag State </p>
<p>35,236,000   Murdered: The Communist Chinese Ant Hill <br>
 <br>
20,946,000   Murdered: The Nazi Genocide State <br>
 <br>
10,214,000   Murdered: The Depraved Nationalist Regime</p>
<p>The Nazis were obsessed with keeping records and filming themselves, the Soviets, secretive and, of course, supported fully and financially by the American left, including the NY Times (the despicable Duranty) who make excuses for them to this day.</p>
<p>David Horowitz, who has been shouted down numerous times (when he explains his position on reparations for slavery) attacked physically, and threatened with death, insists that hecklers and shouters be removed instantly from any venue where he gives a speech.  He says now his detractors turn their backs and sit in silence  &mdash;  Good!  He also insists that security and bodyguards be provided for him when he&rsquo;s on college campuses.</p>
<p>You can bet he supports the Second Amendment (which of course protects the First Amendment).  </p>
<p>&#8220;The only real power comes out of a long rifle&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph Stalin</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
