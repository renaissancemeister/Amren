<h1><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/north_bay&amp;id=7254211">Vallejo City Worker Brutally Attacked by Mob</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Wang and Terry McSweeney, KGO-TV (San Francisco), February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dozens of teenagers saw it happen in broad daylight, but no one has come forward to identify the mob of young people who beat up a Vallejo city worker. Police have released surveillance video to generate tips.</p>
<p>The attack happened in front of two cameras on Feb. 1 at approximately 3:19 p.m.</p>
<p>Surveillance video from Britton&rsquo;s Mini Mart near Vallejo High School shows the 46-year-old city of Vallejo worker in a back hoe being hit with rocks by some kids. He then drives back to the location at Nebraska and Broadway streets to confront the kids who begin attacking the man. The city worker gets knocked down and eventually a crowd of up to 40 people begin beating the man while he is on the ground.</p>
<p>The victim, a 20-year city employee, was transported to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Vallejo where he is being treated for his injuries. Police say the mob fractured his skull, broke his jaw and collarbone, and knocked several teeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p>On top of it all, they went through his pockets and stole his wallet, all while people cheered in front of another camera from a bystander who shot video. Police have already identified several suspects in the video, but they are also offering $1,000 for the arrest and conviction of any other suspects who took part in this mob beating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s the way it is out here every morning,&#8221; Vallejo resident Leonardo Morazan said. &#8220;I even went and talked to the principals before last year. About a year or two years ago they jumped my son. They stole everything from him. I had to go inside and say, &#8216;You know, this needs to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow city worker is one of many asking questions. He did not want his identity shown for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the mayor of Vallejo? Where is his statement, or anybody in the community? There&rsquo;s no outrage. They act like this is an everyday occurrence, that this is OK to happen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The outrage is provoked by the video shot at Britton&rsquo;s Mini Mart where the incident happened. Owner Kamal Sandhu says crimes like this are a common occurrence.</p>

		<p> Guess they forgot to show us a photo of the victim; could it be that they didn&rsquo;t want to make it obvious that he was White? Or was he? No word, either, on the race of the thugs, although it certainly isn&rsquo;t hard to guess.</p>
<p> The &#8220;concerned parents&#8221; they interviewed from the neighborhood were all black; the one &#8220;fellow Vallejo city employee&#8221; was obviously White. But no mention was made of race whatsoever. What a tap dance around a key fact in a story about violent crime!</p>

		<p>Vallejo is a dangerous place. The area to the southeast of Vallejo across Interstate 5 (I-5) is very &#8220;diverse&#8221;  being majority black and chuck full of gangs and cliques of ethnic minority teens and young adults on the prowl and looking for trouble. This general area happens to be where Richmond, California is located. Some of you may remember that recently there was an article about a fifteen year old girl that was gang raped at her prom in front of a group of cheering hispanic onlookers. The entire area is dirty and dangerous with a sky high level of crime.    </p>

		<p>Yes, victim was white - slightly more detailed news coverage <br/>
shows victim at frame &#8220;103&#8221;. You can also pick him out fairly easily, because he is the only white person.</p>

<p>They act like this is an everyday occurrence because it is. The &#8220;Black&#8221; community believes attacks such as this are just part of &#8220;youths&#8221; growing up.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Latino, Asian and White victims of these thug mobs often suffer life long disability because of these fun loving &#8220;youth&#8221; expressing their &#8220;culture&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In a Vallejo news article, a police office says: &#8220;As I understand it, it was a crime of opportunity&#8221;. Huh? Just how much mea culpa gymnastics do people have to engage in these days to justify the barbaric? The insane double standard is screaming at us - we all know that if this &#8220;crime of opportunity&#8221; happened to a black person, at the hands of a white mob, it would be national and likely world news for quite some time. It is utterly disgusting to realize that we have sunk this far as a society. </p>

		<p>Just don&rsquo;t send city workers to the area to maintain anything. They have a right to a safe work environment, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Oh yeah&hellip; that would be &#8220;racist.&#8221; Soon the entire area would start looking as neglected as most of Detroit. Can&rsquo;t have that, can we? Afterall, it&rsquo;s whitey&rsquo;s job to build and fix things, and black folks&rsquo; job to destroy them.</p>

		<p>Just to add historical perspective to this, Vallejo, served as the capital of California in 1852 and 1853 until it was moved to nearby Benecia and then finally Sacramento, was the site of major shipyards in WW2.  It used to be a very pleasant place, and still has a nice public waterfront, but you have to avoid the city at all costs, and here is a good example of why.  The blacks there are the children of the blacks who came from the South to build ships in WW2 and never went home.  If anything illustrates why the Old South had its own vigilante groups for keeping these people in line, surely this is a great example.  In Southern towns where emancipated blacks nearly outnumbered whites, whites had to be strong, even &#8220;ugly&#8221; to defend themselves.  What is going on here and in many places nationwide is the process of whites learning the hard way, that being &#8220;hard&#8221; is what is required to survive.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s time we take a stand against hate and say &#8220;enough is enough&#8221;.  A well-balanced documentary, featuring this video (and the many others like it) should be produced.  It should not start with the motto &#8220;White Pride World Wide&#8221; or anything like that - for the simple reason that we want to reach a wider audience and such slogans (unfortunately) turn people off.  It should inspire anger and tears - but be geared toward society at large.  I wish I had the skills to do it&hellip; Mr. Bodeker?</p>

		<p>I agree with the officer&rsquo;s statement that it was &#8220;a crime of opportunity&#8221;.   Let it be a lesson!  Whenever blacks have the opportunity, they will brutalize whites.  </p>
<p>It is not because &#8220;Vallejo is a dangerous place&#8221;.  It was not &#8220;the place&#8221; that brutally attacked this man, it was the people who inhabit it.  Same goes for my hometown of Detroit.  It is now &#8221; a dangerous place&#8221;.  It wasn&rsquo;t always that way, and the city has not changed its location.   It is the occupants that have changed. </p>
<p>They need no particular &#8220;reason&#8221; to commit violence, particularly against whites, it is simply their nature.  All they need is opportunity, and that is why there is no safety for whites without separation from blacks. </p>

		<p>Vallejo High School has always had these problems.  Blacks at VHS regularly threatened, stalked and/or assaulted white girls who wouldn&rsquo;t go out with them.  Even at the high school across town there were race riots and constant &#8220;demands&#8221; by blacks such as two votes for each black on the student council, etc. and that was 40 years ago.  No surprise that these animals are even worse now.  </p>

Perhaps we need a flood of these kind of crimes to wake up White America. Seems to me that the best way to jumpstart the  cerebral processes of the white mans brain in regards to the nature of Bantu culture is the application of blunt force trauma to his head.<br/>
 Also there are subtle signs that some politicians get it as well, look at all the states that have concealed carry laws as well as revamped Castle doctrines, who do you think these pieces of legislation were designed for? </p>

		<p>Blacks are the only race who as a matter of first reflex (never mind last resort) engages in mass-swarming assaults of this type.  Perhaps some anthropologist can explain it.  In the meantime, these beatdowns are felonies.  So I ask:  Where&rsquo;s a good cop when you need one?</p>

		<p>I used to drive a truck for a purified water company in the heart of Cleveland&rsquo;s mean streets. I would get glared upon and have liquor bottles thrown at my truck. As far as stopping at lights.  I would high tail it outta there as fast as they could say, &#8220;Get tha cracka!&#8221;. I always would carry a little .38 pistol with me just in case. I am reading alot of good comments by most of you. Detroit guy- you are absolutely right when you say that the only peace whites will have is when they are separated from us.</p>

<p>Another excellent point. The blacks here in Cleveland complained when a serial strangler killed 11 women here over a span of 20 years. The television crews interviewed people in the neighborhood and they all said that cops should have caught the guy earlier. And I thought the same thing. They complain about not enough police, they complain that the cops are always around. You can&rsquo;t win with these unreasonable people. </p>

		<p>Anon. #15: If things were reversed, there would be non-stop News Coverage, across the Country, about how a poor Mau Mau was just minding his business, when a pack of mean, &#8220;Racist&#8221; Whites attacked him. </p>
<p>No real reason is given as to why the Whites may have attacked him, or that he tried to rob, or rape, someone. Those facts are always left out of the story, as &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; charges are filed, and Mass Street Demonstrations, and riots, ensue. </p>
<p>I want to know where are all the angry, and fed up Whites, like those who post here, when it comes to spontaneous Street Demonstrations? Whites Rallied against constant taxes, in Tea Party demonstrations, so where are they now? I would imagine that this would be far more important to them.</p>

		<p>The video is interesting. At the time it was shot, despite a $1000 reward, NO ONE has stepped forward to help police. No one. Says a lot about interracial empathy on the part of the blacks living in that community toward their white neighbors, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>This sounds great on paper, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to bear out in the real world. The fact is, we already <i>have</i> a flood of these kinds of attacks. You could fill a small library with the accounts covered by AmRen alone. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be causing much awakening. </p>
<p>Really, I don&rsquo;t think people are as totally ignorant of black culture as they seem. Even the most liberal, diversity worshiping, multi-cult dimwits go out of their way to live apart from blacks and black neighborhoods. They certainly don&rsquo;t want their children to be outnumbered in a black school. the list goes on. There&rsquo;s a reason for this, and despite what ever they might tell you, they know exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I think the real problem is not so much ignorance of black behavior. Rather, people seem more than willing to ignore the inconvenient and deny the obvious in order to maintain this charade in which they seem so emotionally invested. I can&rsquo;t for the life of me understand where this emotional investment comes from, but it&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s also the reason they react so apoplectically to us.</p>
<p>Oh, and btw, the quote you were looking for is &#8220;Why so serious?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Poster#20 BM Sam, I tend to agree with you on this. It isn&rsquo;t unawareness, it&rsquo;s &#8220;WILLFULL&#8221; ignorance. That&rsquo;s a very dangerous kind of ignorance, very hard to break through for the person who engages in it. It&rsquo;s actually a habit, and like other habits, it covers some other problem the person is unwilling to face.</p>

		<p>Sometimes people believe that others basically think just like they do.  This is called &#8220;projection.&#8221;  If, e.g., people are mean and hateful, they will often think people who act in a pleasant, kind way are putting on an act.</p>
<p>How is it that white liberals know that they are in danger if they walk through an all black neighborhood after the sun sets, yet become furious if anyone suggests that blacks are more crime-prone than whites?  The answer is:  Liberals believe that, yes, currently blacks might be a teensy, tiny bit more violent and crime-prone than whites, maybe, but the ONLY reason is that other races don&rsquo;t lift up the black community enough.  </p>
<p>If the more successful races just keep HELPING blacks with a few more social programs, special treatment and lots of affirmative action jobs, in just a couple more years (maybe 8 years at the maximum!) blacks will be just as accomplished as any other race!  Whites especially just aren&rsquo;t trying hard enough to help!  </p>
<p>White people:  keep trying to help and keep working hard at your stressful jobs so you can pay more taxes so the government can help too!  </p>
<p>Of course, if it takes 250 years and trillions of dollars of taxpayer aid for blacks to become a law abiding, high I.Q. people, and if during that time whites disappear from the Earth due to overwork, persecution, and by merging their recessive genes with the darker races, oh, well, no big deal, whites were soooo incredibly racist and not nearly as helpful as they could have been.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t know much about Valejo, so had to look it up.  Very interesting.</p>
<p>In  2007, Osby Davis was elected as the city&rsquo;s first black mayor.<br/>
Whether or not it&rsquo;s relevant,  I don&rsquo;t know, but in 2008 the city filed for bankruptcy, becoming the largest city  ever to do so in California.   Stephanie Gomes, City Councilwoman, largely blames exorbitant salaries and benefits for Vallejo firefighters and police officers. Reportedly, salaries and benefits for public safety workers account for 80 percent of Vallejo&rsquo;s general fund budget.</p>
