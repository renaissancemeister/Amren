<h1>Judge Stacks 100 Years to Cobbins&rsquo; Life-Without-Parole Sentence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Knox County judge today stacked 100 years to convicted killer Letalvis Cobbins&rsquo; life without parole sentence.</p>
<p>The time was for crimes committed leading up the deaths of Knox County couple Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, in January 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the worst of the worst,&#8221; Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner said. &#8220;If ever there was a case that deserved maximum sentencing, this case deserves maximum sentencing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision came after a hearing to determine whether Cobbins should receive additional punishment for crimes that preceded the deaths of the University of Tennessee student and her boyfriend, a trim carpenter.</p>
<p>Newsom&rsquo;s father had made an extraordinary appeal to his son&rsquo;s killer during the hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you have to do is testify in a grand jury hearing stating who participated in grabbing Chris and Channon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all you have to do is make arrangements before you go back to prison to testify before a grand jury and at Eric Boyd&rsquo;s trial,&#8221; Hugh Newsom told Cobbins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Newsom told Cobbins that in return he would ask the media to allow Cobbins to make a public appeal to &#8220;kids growing up in a situation like you did, telling them crime doesn&rsquo;t pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobbins answered him with silence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobbins was convicted of their deaths and of kidnapping and robbing them and of raping Christian. He was acquitted of raping Newsom.</p>
<p>Cobbins was the first of four defendants to be tried in the case.</p>
<p>Davidson has been sentenced to death. Suspect George Thomas was sentenced to life without parole. Suspect Vanessa Coleman faces trial in May.</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;This is the worst of the worst,&rdquo; Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner said. &ldquo;If ever there was a case that deserved maximum sentencing, this case deserves maximum sentencing.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>But he did not get maximum sentencing, because he did not get the death penalty.  Instead, he will be in prison for the &#8220;rest of his life,&#8221; where he can or could:  (1) Rape whites in prison who are in for much lesser offenses, (2) Break out of prison and commit more crimes, (3) Become a far left cause celebre, and cool his heels until  Christian and Newsom are forgotten and either a lefty Obama-appointed judge or liberal Democrat TN Governor springs him loose to commit more crimes.  (4)  Be released 20-30 years from now because TN becomes Mexico&rsquo;s newest colony, (parts of East TN are already becoming that way), and the increased costs of social services strains the state budget, and opening prison doors becomes &#8220;necessary,&#8221; a la California today.</p>
<p><i>Newsom told Cobbins that in return he would ask the media to allow Cobbins to make a public appeal to &ldquo;kids growing up in a situation like you did, telling them crime doesn&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>You would think as many times as this has been done, and as many such appeals have been made, that everyone would get the message.  I bet Mr. Cobbins once heard that &#8220;crime doesn&rsquo;t pay.&#8221;  Doesn&rsquo;t appear that he paid attention.</p>

		<p>Wasn&rsquo;t judge Baumgartner accused of orchestrating the trial so that Cobbins wouldn&rsquo;t get the death sentence?  He let de baby mommas come into de courtroom hold&rsquo;n dey babies so dey be&rsquo;d keep&rsquo;n it real.  Didn&rsquo;t that display of humanity convince the jury to give life in prison and not death?</p>
<p>Now the judge acts all offended at Cobbins for killing two whites by saying its &#8220;the worst of the worst&#8221;. </p>
<p>What will the splc, adl, and naacp make of that pro white comment?  Surely it must be racist to say &#8220;worst&#8221; when a black kills a white.  That one toxic and poisonous and outdated prejudicial comment sadly set back race relations in this country at least 24 months.  The bigots will all be saying the &#8220;worst thing that can happen&#8221; is for a black to kill a white, making the cancer of white racism all the more virulent in society.  </p>

		<p>I agree with some of the commentators that you cannot trust succeeding office holders such as governors to follow suit in keeping people such as Cobbins in prison for the rest of his life.  It happened here in Illinois only a few months ago.  A minor jail official granted early releases to over 1,000 inmates because of overcrowding and they committed more of the same vicious crimes.  The best thing that can happen to those that took the lives of this beautiful, young, white couple, Christian Newsom and Channon Christian is that they will be killed while serving their sentences.  As someone mentioned earlier, they will enjoy prison life otherwise, three meals a day, working out, listening to rap music, shcukin&rsquo; and jiving&rsquo; with de boyz.  They will be telling how they raped that white boy and his girl, and what a high it was.  They&rsquo;ll be able to rape some other young white men while being locked up.  You cannot trust those in power over the penal system to keep their promises.  That&rsquo;s it.</p>

		<p>I doubt Cobbins will want a re-trial, Skip, because if he gets one, the death penalty becomes available again.</p>
<p>That said, the fact that the death penalty was not handed to Cobbins is an absolute disgrace.  If a kidnap/gang-rape/torture/murder case this grotesque - so horrific I normally neither read items here on the subject nor respond to them because I feel physically sick and hurt when I think about the incident - does not merit a death penalty, then what, I must ask, is the bloody point of having capital punishment at all?  Bernie Madoff will die in prison, too, but all he did was steal money, rather than the lives of two innocent young people, and Bernie Madoff did not make his victims&rsquo; last hours a living hell.  Were I living in Tennessee, I would sell my home and leave the state.</p>

		<p>I am a metro Atlantan and was very angry(but not surprised) when a majority-black jury sentenced courthouse killer Brian Nichols to life w/o parole and not the death penalty. He killed 4 people, including one black, and carjacked, harmed, and terrorized others. He nearly killed another black. If all of his victims had been white, he&rsquo;d probably have been acquitted. It wasn&rsquo;t as if there were any doubt as to his guilt. He committed heinous crimes in front of witnesses and held Ashley Smith in captivity after having admitted to them. I don&rsquo;t see whites rioting, yet blacks raised h-ll over the Jena 6 not being freed! This kind of &#8220;justice&#8221; is what we can expect but should not tolerate.</p>

<p>To #7  &mdash;  Cindy,</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t have expected anything better for Brian Nichols. He was black in a black run city and judiciary.  Remember when Marvin Arrington kicked the whites out of his courtroom and never gave an explanation other than blacks don&rsquo;t like to admonish other blacks in front of whites?  Even Bill Cosby came to Atlanta to make things safe for Marvin by saying &#8220;So a few whites said they were offended. So what!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Cosby is used by those agitprop groups who are at fault for your having to constantly see afrovoodoo faces in your living room on the tv. His Huxtable tv character is credited with changing white attitudes about blacks.  Blacks seem less frightening to whites after we watch the Cosby Show&rsquo;s portrayal of upper middle class blacks acting like whites. Sort of like people&rsquo;s view of Nazi Germany improves after watching the Nuremburg Festival video.</p>
<p>The reason you see blacks in every tv commercial and tv show is because of the &#8220;saturation theory&#8221; put out by folks like the National Association of Black Journalists, etc.  They want whites constantly surrounded by images of non threatening blacks, and that&rsquo;s how they are &#8220;changing attitudes and breaking down outdated barriers and eliminating prejudice.&#8221;  (The gay agenda works the same way. Gays are pushed on us through the media constantly, and the targets are children who are supposed to be desensitized.)</p>
<p>It is an unnatural manipulation of whites, but if whites fall for it, then they deserve to be mongrelized out of existence.</p>
<p>What is the crime rate in your part of Atlanta, and do whites there have a properly maintained fear of blacks, or do they believe that their fears are based on irrational prejudice and unconfessed racism that still lingers in their hearts like a poisonous and virulent cancer?<br>

		<p>Black jurors seem willing to convict black murderers, but not to give them the death penalty.  The perception is that too many black men are sentenced to death, while whites are not.  The Supreme Court has found that this isn&rsquo;t so.<br>
Blacks cannot become full members of Western society if they continue to circle the ethnic wagons every time there&rsquo;s a perceived affront to one of their own.  They also need to stop whining every time they see a dangling rope (USC San Diego) or cotton bolls strewn in front of a black culture center (U of Missouri).</p>

__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>As much as I hate it I have to agree&hellip;.</p>
<p>You were talking about alot of blacks being on television.  I agree with that assessment as well.<br>
The idea and agenda is making Whites constantly seeing blacks wherever and whatever situation is on the tv.  There ALWAYS has to be a black involved.  to &#8216;include&rsquo; them in everything, whether we all know that they dont participate in these activities.</p>
<p>They want to constantly bombard you with the faces of blacks so you will come &#8216;accustomed&rsquo; to seeing them everywhere, like its &#8216;normal&rsquo;, but in reality we all know it isnt like that which is portrayed on the screen.</p>
<p>At the same time the government is putting blacks in positions of power over Whites in business, labor jobs, offices, state and local law enforcements&hellip;etc.</p>
<p>Look around, notice.  look at your govt. jobs program, your local law enforcement, your local hospitals&hellip;.the BIG bosses are White but the menial workers are black or non-White of some kind.</p>
<p>A lot of people dont see these things because either they dont watch whats going on around them, or two, they just dont give a damn.</p>
<p>They will have to participate in the festivities.  They will have to fight&hellip;.or else lay on their stomach.</p>
<p>Some have already chosen to lay down.</p>
<p>Weak and cowardice people.  Small, little men.</p>
<p>If they have betrayed themselves what makes you think they wont do the same to you, or me??  We dont need nor want them. </p>

		<p>Another reason for the constant image of Diversity (which means dispossessed whites surrounded by blacks is to create the impression in young white minds that Diversity is the norm, while &#8220;all white&#8221; is the racist, unAmerican evil scourge to be eradicated like a deadly toxin and virulent cancer. &#8220;Tea Parties are too white&#8221;, means if your white parents go to a Tea Party, you should report them to your teacher for not passionately embracing diversity and  therefore  are guilty of racist Nazi evil and hate crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you parents go to Tea Parties or talk about our historic first african american president Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate? They probably have Nazi swastika flags hanging in their closet.&#8221;</p>
<p>White school children are being taught that if they don&rsquo;t include afrovoodoos as playmates and friends and sexually helpful boyfriends, then they are being racist, exclusive, and possessing too much unearned white privilege that hurts minorities and prevents change and progress.  By not having black friends, whites are disgracing Father Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator Who Saved the Union from the Raciss Slave Owning South and Who Gave Us Our New Gospel When He Said: </p>
<p>&#8220;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. &hellip;.. that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Images and rhetoric of Diversity are all part of  planned and implemented critical theory tactics to shame whites into giving up more of what is theirs by the rights of nature, God, and blood.  As far as I care, any white girl who isn&rsquo;t repulsed at the thought of all this Diversity propaganda and its consequences doesn&rsquo;t have the genetic integrity to breed with us. Let her follow the afro path of syphilis and death and ugly  mulatto babies.  </p>
<p>Our truest heroines are the few remaining white girls who are genuinely white, think white, talk white, act white, and want whites only.  They are the resegregationists, and they are our best hope.    </p>
<p>Please, white women born of the womb of great whiteness, praise God for your white privileges, and curse those who curse you.  Yes, love Jesus all you want, but let Jesus love your enemies for you. Don&rsquo;t let your enemies destroy you just because you can&rsquo;t tell the difference between turning the other cheek and being robbed, raped, and murdered.  Jesus said &#8220;Love thine enemy,&#8221; which is proof you can never logically comprehend Jesus, but he never said offer yourself to your afrovoodoo enemy for ceremonies of savage lust and violence and white womb destruction.    </p>
<p>Abandon the notion of Judeo-Christian obligations; embrace your Anglo-Christian right to survive, and do it in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  </p>
<p>Jesus did not say &#8220;you don&rsquo;t have enemies,&#8221; he only described who would be your ideal enemy, and that is one whom you can love into loving your back, which implicitly mean because you both are kin.  That doesn&rsquo;t work between our Celtic, Anglo,Saxon, Nordic whites and the lesser non white breeds who surround and threaten your life, liberty, property, and happiness.</p>

		<p>This is what they are teaching your white children. If your white children come home hating your for having giving them love, sacrifice, and privilege, kick them out of the house and let them learn what life is like without you.

<p>The idea seems to be that in a just society, a well intentioned person would naturally shun any unfair advantage over others. Paula Rothenberg&rsquo;s White Privilege: Essential Readings on the Other Side of Racism, 2008, makes this argument. She writes: &ldquo;But, let us assume that I am a white person, and after reading the articles in this book I am persuaded that there is such a thing as white privilege and that I benefit from it. Why might I want to rid myself of that privilege rather than continue to enjoy it and pass it along to my children? The answer has to do with simple notions of fairness and justice. Most people would feel little sense of pride or accomplishment in winning a race they started with an unfair advantage or winning a game when the deck was stacked in their favor. The satisfaction of such &lsquo;victories&rsquo; is short-lived at best. Once I begin to recognize how much of my success is a consequence of unfair advantage, I cannot help but begin to seek ways to make amends.&rdquo; </p>

Of course Kauffman, Cabral, &amp; co. are not liberals. They are left-wing totalitarians. For them, &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is merely a euphemism for the stigmatization and dispossession of whites by Jews and non-whites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity&rdquo; does not mean diversity of opinion. It means black leftists, lesbian leftists, Asian leftists, mestizo leftists, feminist leftists, etc. all working under the tutelage of Jewish leftists to root out every possible form of white racial consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversity&rdquo; does not mean that all races and ethnic groups should take pride in themselves and watch out for their interests. No, when whites do that, it is not &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; it is &ldquo;hate.&rdquo; And the fanatical persecution of &ldquo;hate&rdquo; is what leftists call &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;  &mdash;  and, presumably, &ldquo;love&rdquo; (they are all just snarling and sputtering with love).<br>

		<p>Excellent post at 15, though I wish you would have included the URL. It really sums up very well what the hard Left&rsquo;s ethnic/racial program is all about. As a propaganda note, I think &#8220;fanatical persecution of whites&#8221; by anyone like those you mention (or anywhere it is justified for that matter) ought to be included in our standard white self-defense lexicon. It could help turn the tables a little. I know how these people think, and they are fanatics, incapable of true thought or of looking for the truth but wholly capable of persecution. They are the Western, secular equivalent of religious fanatics of the past and present. And that could be putting it mildly. Some of them are also half insane, if not vicious sociopaths, in my experience, a very low breed of human being. That does not stop them from being very effective in confusing people and leading them astray. By no means are all radical leftists that bad or even all wrong (except when it comes to blind dogmatism regarding whites), but the fact is enough of them are sociopathic to make whites more and more of an endangered group. Nor, I should say, are all those out to oppress whites leftist, some being minority right wing ethnic fanatics.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m becoming more and more convinced that the judicial system needs to include castration as part of its punishment menu.  There&rsquo;s been some talk of &#8220;chemical castration&#8221; for sex offenders; and that would be an improvement over the status quo, but nothing is as simple and permanent as surgical removal and destruction of the testes.</p>
<p>Instantly the major source of the man&rsquo;s aggression and libido is permanently gone.  Prisons become much easier to govern as fighting declines.  Prison rape becomes almost non-existent, and the horrible fate awaiting many white inmates recedes into history like the Ottoman slave markets.  Released inmates would be far less likely to commit violent crimes.  Best of all, noting how much higher the proportion of criminals is who are sons of criminals than are sons of non-criminals, we create a positive eugenic effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how to get there from here, especially with the 8th amendment in place, other than to suggest that we could offer it as an option for prisoners in exchange for a reduced sentence.</p>

		<p>I forgot also to mention the very positive effects of humiliation.  Criminals, especially blacks and mestizos, have no fear of jail - indeed for many it is the only life they know and a booster of prestige.  Nor do they fear execution - they are surrounded by death in their &#8220;music&#8221; and other folk culture, and all expect to die young.  For them, the real fear is humiliation, to be un-manned.  And what would be more un-manning than castration?</p>
