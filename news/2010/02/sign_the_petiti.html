<h1><a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/news/february-12-2010/sign-petition-reduce-welfare-rolls.html">Sign the Petition to Reduce Welfare Rolls</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NumbersUSA, February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Approximately 1/2 of immigrant households (both legal and illegal) with kids access welfare services, primarily food and Medicaid. Many argue that immigration is a social issue, but it&rsquo;s a fiscal issue as well. Sign our petition urging Pres. Obama, Speaker of the House Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Reid to stop expanding our welfare system through high immigration numbers.</p>
<p>The immigrant population has grown by an average of 1.3 million per year since 2000, plus an additional 1 million new births in those households. That&rsquo;s 23 million new people every decade, and HALF of all immigrant families are using welfare, especially food and Medicaid welfare! This includes illegal AND legal immigrants. See Roy&rsquo;s blog [Roy Beck&rsquo;s blog is available <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/node/5260" target="blog" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>] to read the whole ugly story.</p>
<p>Pres. Obama has pledged to reduce our deficits, so isn&rsquo;t this a good time to send hundreds of thousands of petitions to him, Reid and Pelosi suggesting a suspension of most immigration that is driving those deficits up?</p>
<p>Sign our petition NOW and then send it to your friends and family. If your on Facebook or Twitter, please share the link to help get the message to Washington!</p>

		<p>I signed the petition, but I doubt that it will have any effect on this pro-black community organizer and his pro-black administration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced Obama is going to be pleased if he can get his health care bill passed in some form, and any other pro-black legislation, and he doesn&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s re-elected or not, so long as he can &#8220;fundamentally transform&#8221; this system into a pro-black one where a huge wealth shift takes place moving from whites to blacks.</p>
<p>The irony of it all is that even if he&rsquo;s successful, blacks will benefit only on a short term basis, then begin losing out again, due to inability.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be some serious fireworks going on beginning this year and beyond, so it should be interesting to see how it all unfolds.</p>

		<p>When I was doing welfare fraud investigations, immigration status was not considered. <br>
When a person applied for welfare, their immigration status was not checked because it was a violation of their privacy rights.</p>

		<p>From the article- &#8220;That&rsquo;s 23 million new people every decade&#8221; through immigration. <br>
   And since almost all are third-worlders, that means nearly 23 million new non-whites are being added to the country via immigration policies, policies that could easily be changed if whites woke up and began demanding that their government started protecting their interests. And what&rsquo;s more, taxpayers (who are disproportionately white) are being forced to substidize this increase of new people to the tune of several BILLION dollars each and every year.  </p>

		<p>And yet the &#8216;clever&rsquo; people who write for the WSJ insist day after day that mass immigration &#8216;benefits&rsquo; America and are the well-spring of &#8216;economic prosperity&rsquo;.<br>
 Unfortunately the WSJ has too much influence on vain and pompous politicians who wish to appear &#8216;clever&rsquo; by parrotting its opinions.</p>

		<p>Of course, the great &#8216;Ellis Island&rsquo; wave of immigrants (to whom the new immigrants are sometimes flattered and patronised by comparision), were entitled to no public assistance whatsoever.Those with incurable medical conditions were sent back.Those who couldn&rsquo;t make it in the USA went home at their own expense.</p>

		<p>I wager that the other half of immigrants not on welfare, in the aggregate, do not pay enough in tax to cover the cost of state amenities granted to them.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know if I would call them our greatest enemy, but I agree with you that pro-multicultural &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are deadlier than liberals.  This is why I am glad Obama got elected and hope he pushes further to the left.  Most conservatives are so unintelligent and partisan that they oppose whatever Obama does without thinking.  If Obama supports amnesty, they will be against it; when Reagan granted amnesty, many of them supported it.  There is less chance of getting an amnesty bill under Obama than under McCain for this reason.  </p>
<p>I signed the petition, too, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone will care.  The politicians don&rsquo;t care; all we can do is vote them out.  Eventually, there will be so many welfare-dependent minorities in this country that even that will be impossible.  I predict this tipping point will likely occur within the next decade. The GOP may win the White House in 2012 but that will be the last time. Whites are already a minority in Texas.  When the anchor babies start turning 18 and start voting, Texas will go from deep Red to Blue almost overnight.  Without Texas, Republicans cannot win the presidency - period.  How will these racially- oblivious white conservatives respond when this reality sinks in?  This is when things will really start to get interesting in this country.</p>

		<p>These are just my personal observations, but the facts around welfare seem to illustrate some basic facts about two minority groups in particular.  In the black community, self sufficiency seems to be largely absent from the conversation.  Latinos on the other hand often cover the majority of their needs through self sufficiency, but seek to gain advantage through dishonesty and corrupt acts (such as sending hundreds of dollars to mexico while collecting American food stamps).</p>
<p>Unfortunately these circumstances have a cumulative, destructive effect on society.  This is especially true in a country such as the United States with massive growth of poverty oriented folks through immigration and super-human fecundity.</p>

		<p>Mexicans purposely killing whites with black-tar heroin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the idiosyncrasies of Xalisco dealers is that they generally do not sell to African Americans or Latinos. Instead, they have focused on middle- and working-class whites, believing them to be a safer and more profitable clientele, according to narcotics investigators and former dealers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to move to a city with many young white people,&rdquo; Chavez said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s who uses their drug and that&rsquo;s who they&rsquo;re not afraid of.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
