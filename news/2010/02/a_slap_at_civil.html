<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to reports, the main motivation of the sponsor of SB247 is to honor the memory of John Browning, the Utah gun manufacturer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Browning was indeed an innovator. He held 128 gun patents and was a key figure in the early years of the state. His innovations influenced virtually all future designs of firearms and are still a part of firearms today.</p>
<p>But SB247, sponsored by Sen. Mark Madsen, R-Eagle Mountain, would create a state holiday honoring Browning on the very same day as the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. That could not possibly be a coincidence, and it is a slap in the face to the civil-rights struggle and to years of efforts to get Utah lawmakers to honor King in Utah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hearing that this bill is dead on arrival. That&rsquo;s good. But its very suggestion has the potential to harm the state.</p>
<p>The enduring image of the movement for black equality in the mid 20th century is of peaceful demonstrations led by King and others on the one hand, and the racist establishment on the other, with rifles in hand, ready to enforce the unwritten rules of bigotry. {snip}</p>
<p>Surely there is nothing inherently evil about guns. The Founding Fathers included the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment as an important human right. But the connection of guns as tools of violence with the civil-rights era of the 1950s and &rsquo;60s is too strong for anyone to miss. By suggesting that King&rsquo;s holiday be shared with Browning, Madsen has managed to diminish the legacies of both men, while giving Utah a racist image it does not deserve.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It took Utah lawmakers years to change a holiday from a generic human rights day to one specifically honoring King. It took even longer to convince them to not meet in session on that day. The current crop of legislative leadership has a much better understanding of the importance of civil rights in the nation&rsquo;s history. Creating a Browning day on that holiday now would be an act loaded with hidden meanings and animosities. {snip}<br>

		<p>Last year was particularly satisfying for me, as MLK day also fell on January 19, which is Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s birthday. Needless to say, I proudly flew my Confederate battle flag in his honor. I also fly my U.S. flag on the 21st of January, which is the great John Moses Browning&rsquo;s birthday. To make the correlation between a firearm genius, and a black communist agitator is quite a stetch. Most don&rsquo;t realize that the basis for gun control in this country was to keep firearms out of the hands of the newly freed slaves. I&rsquo;m sure MLK would be pleased to share a holiday with John Browning.</p>

<p>The enduring image for White American Citizens of black equality is the black hate crime violence against white mothers, sisters, and daughters.</p>
<p>We were told to give to blacks the equality, and in return our women were robbed, raped, and murdered.</p>
<p>We dedicate our social consciousnesses to Julie Love, Shannon Christian, Eve Carson, Emily Haddock, Anne Pressley, and Kristen Warneke.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the actual comment to someone else, but there is just Too much &#8216;evil&rsquo;? irony here for someone to miss&hellip; at least if ones knows the difference between &#8216;image&rsquo; and &#8216;reality&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The ultimate question should be&hellip; Who was from Utah and who wasn`t? I doubt that Martin Luther King was or even went there. Sounds like Browning was a native son&hellip;</p>

		<p>To compare King, an immoral whoremonger and plagiarizer, with John Browning, a phenomenal one-of-a-kind engineering genius with no formal education, is an outrage.  </p>
<p>I sat down once and tried to count up all the firearms Browning designed and built from scratch in his own machine shop.  I stopped at fifty, realizing that I was no more than halfway there.  Most incredibly, virtually all the prototypes were able to go into series production without further refinement or redesign.  Their variety is particularly remarkable, ranging from the 1885 single shot rifle to the Browning M2 .50 Caliber machine gun, still in service ninety years after its introduction. The number and variety of original Browning designs still in series production today is simply incredible.</p>
<p>Browning was certainly one of the most remarkable men to emerge at the blossoming of the machine age.  That he is virtually unknown outside the realm of firearms represents a gross failure of those who write history.</p>

		<p>MLK Day?! I noticed that on my calendar. Being a native Virginian, I proudly celebrate Lee-Jackson Day on that same date. Both Robert E. Lee and Thomas &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson were great Virginians/Americans worthy of remembrance!</p>

		<p> What a shame that the Deseret News, owned and operated by the almost always sensible Mormon church, published such a piece of P.C. drivel as this editorial is. One wonders if they &#8220;borrowed it&#8221; from the Southern Poverty Law Center handbook or some such.</p>
<p> Yes, I&rsquo;m joking about that part. But I hardly think a lawmaker&rsquo;s trying to establish a state holiday for a famed gunmaker, on the same day as the MLK holiday, merits such an elephant stomp as the Deseret News did on him. Could there be a good reason that he chose that day, that the editorial is neglecting to tell us about?</p>
<p> The MLK day holiday is one that will have to be kept on permanent life support because it is a continuing source of ironic amusement and scorn to so many Americans. No one batted an eye when the federal government did away with the separate Lincoln&rsquo;s and Washington&rsquo;s birthday holidays, and rolled both into a generic &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day.&#8221; But literally thousands of schools, public offices, etc., across the country, were mercilessly browbeaten into closing down, totally and completely, for the holiday honoring this plaigiarist, philanderer, and occasional binge drinker.</p>

		<p>He designs haven&rsquo;t just influenced firearms in use today, his designs are in use! The M1911 is one of the most popular semi-automatic handguns in the United States, I see guys shooting Browning Auto 5s everything time I go to shoot trap, and the US military is still using the M2 Browning nine decades after he designed it! What&rsquo;s insulting is that a holiday for this American genius is passed of for the sake of a charlatan and profligate who was an anti-American communist.</p>

<p><i>But the connection of guns as tools of violence with the civil-rights&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Excuse me, but isn&rsquo;t the number of firearms homicides of blacks attributable to the &#8220;racist establishment&#8221; in fact a tiny fraction of the number attributable to blacks themselves?</p>
<p>Whenever blacks take political control of a jurisdiction, the first thing they do is <i>disarm their own people</i>.  In other words, they as much as admit that their claims of equality were false.</p>
<p>I can see why they would hate John Browning. The man came up with 128 more ways for them to &#8220;off&#8221; one another!<br>

<p>When even WWII is mentioned only in passing in current school &#8220;history&#8221; books, nothing of Viet-Nam or Korean wars why why should we expect a man who isn&rsquo;t black to be remembered? BTW in those same &#8220;history&#8221; books were page after page of MLK nonsense.</p>

		<p>In Arkansas, the law has always specifically recognized Martin Luther King and Robert E. Lee birhday as the same day. Seems like the only fair way to address the subject, I just wish the other 49 states would do the same.<br>

<p>Yes, as citizens, King and his followers had the right to demonstrate.  And during WWII every American fighter plane,  bomber, tank, ship, etc&hellip; was equipt with a (many) Browning .50cal. machine guns.  Browning&rsquo;s contributions GREATLY contributed to complete Allied victory.  Some how I doubt Nazi controll of North America in the 1960s would have offered blacks or ANY of us those rights.  Thank You Mr. Browning!  Heaven forbid we recognize your WORLDLY contributions!</p>
<p>People, lets embrace our history before certain ideologies try to make us forget it or completely re-write it!</p>

<p>One could postulate further that if the US had curtailed immigration of non-Europeans from Europe 80 years ago we never would have entered WWII, the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement would never have blossomed, Europe would not be facing a muslim invasion and MLK would be buried in a forgotten weed covered plot. <br>
