			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Hawley, Arizona Republic (Phoenix), February 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Across Mexico, the continuing ability of traffickers to topple governments like Tancitaro&rsquo;s [a town in central Mexico], intimidate police and keep drug shipments flowing is raising doubts about the Mexican government&rsquo;s 3-year-old, U.S.-backed war on the drug cartels.</p>
<p>Far from eliminating the gangs, the battle has exposed criminal networks more ingrained than most Americans could imagine: Hidden economies that employ up to one-fifth of the people in some Mexican states. Business empires that include holdings as everyday as gyms and a day-care center.</p>
<p>And the death toll continues to mount: Mexico saw 6,587 drug-related murders in 2009, up from 5,207 in 2008 and 2,275 in 2007, according to an unofficial tally by the respected newspaper Reforma.</p>
<p>Cartels have multiplied, improved their armament and are perfecting simultaneous, terrorist-style attacks.</p>
<p>Some analysts are warning that Mexico is on the verge of becoming a &#8220;narco-state&#8221; like 1990s-era Colombia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the latest sign of the cartels&rsquo; grip, on Wednesday the National Action Party of President Felipe Calderón announced it was calling off primary elections in the northern state of Tamaulipas because drug traffickers had infiltrated politics.</p>
<p>And in Chihuahua, the government is redeploying troops from the embattled city of Juarez to the countryside because of fears that the cartels are cementing their control in smaller border towns.</p>
<p>Even Calderón, who a year ago angrily rebutted suggestions that Mexico was becoming a &#8220;failed state,&#8221; is now describing his crackdown as a fight for territory and &#8220;the very authority of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Towns on the ropes</b></p>
<p>In places like Tancitaro, population 26,000, the battle already may be lost.</p>
<p>In the past year, gunmen killed seven police officers, murdered a top town administrator and kidnapped others, said Martin Urbina, a city official. The reasons were unclear  &mdash;  most of the town leaders are in hiding and could not be reached for comment  &mdash;  but the drug traffickers were apparently demanding the removal of certain police officers, Urbina said.</p>
<p>When the traffickers kidnapped the two officials&rsquo; fathers on Nov. 30, it was the last straw.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Vicente Guerrero, in Durango state, 34 of 38 police resigned after the police chief and four officers were kidnapped. The victims have not been found.</p>
<p>In the border town of Puerto Palomas, the police chief fled to the United States and asked for asylum in March, saying Mexican officials could not protect him. In October, traffickers killed the town administrator in Puerto Palomas.</p>
<p>In the northern town of Namiquipa, traffickers killed the mayor and two top town officials last year. Police there are woefully outgunned, police Chief Jesus Hinojosa said. There are only 15 weapons for 39 police officers.</p>
<p>Often the cartels target city officials they believe are cooperating with federal authorities, said Juan Manuel Bautista, the City Council secretary in the western town of Novolato, where traffickers have killed 25 police, two city councilmen and a town administrator in the past two years.</p>
<p>Other times, they are simply lashing back at the most convenient targets, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even when governments replace police chiefs, mayors and town councils, it&rsquo;s often only a matter of time before the replacements are bribed, intimidated at the barrel of a gun or killed, and the scenario repeats itself, said Bernardo Gonzalez Arechiga, an expert on crime at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Advanced Studies.</p>
<p>In May, federal officials arrested 10 mayors in Michoacan state on charges of protecting smugglers.</p>
<p>In June, Mauricio Fernández, a mayoral candidate in the wealthy Monterrey suburb of San Pedro Garza Garcia, was recorded telling a meeting of supporters that he had negotiated a truce with the Beltrán Leyva gang as a way of guaranteeing security in the town. Fernández later denied any contact with the gang. He easily won the July 2 election.</p>
<p><b>Financial octopus</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In many towns, smugglers pay for playgrounds and other things the government cannot afford. Bank loans are expensive and hard to get in Mexico, a lingering effect of the country&rsquo;s bank crises during the 1990s, so traffickers have stepped in to provide small-business loans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2006, the number of Mexican citizens and companies on the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s blacklist of suspected drug smugglers has nearly doubled, from 188 to 362.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In March, the financial magazine Forbes included Joaquín &#8220;Chapo&#8221; Guzmán in its list of the world&rsquo;s billionaires for the first time. Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, was listed at No. 701 with a net worth of about $1 billion.</p>
<p>In fact, Guzmán&rsquo;s cartel and other gangs probably bring in $3.8 billion just to Sinaloa state alone, said Guillermo Ibarra, an economist who used bank and government statistics to compile an estimate this year.</p>
<p>That is 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s economy, twice as much as all of its factories put together. The drug trade employs about a fifth of the state&rsquo;s 2.6 million population, either directly or indirectly, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Gangs going strong</b></p>
<p>The cartels also have found ways to defend their core drug business by moving marijuana farms to U.S. national parks, finding new smuggling routes through Africa and into Europe, and strengthening their supply lines in Central America.</p>
<p>Drug prices and purity in the United States, the main measure of trafficking, shows the crackdown is having only mixed results.</p>
<p>Cocaine prices in the United States jumped from $132 a gram to $182 a gram from September 2007 to September 2008, the latest date for which the Drug Enforcement Administration has released numbers.</p>
<p>But during the same period, methamphetamine got stronger and cheaper, dropping from $213 per gram to $184 per gram.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Their product is also improving, the report said: Marijuana potency in 2008 was the highest it has ever been.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 2008, Mexican drug smugglers have been arrested in Australia, New Zealand and the African nations of Sierra Leone and Togo. U.S. prosecutors say the Gulf Cartel has struck deals with the New York mob and the Ndrangheta Mafia of Italy to smuggle cocaine into Europe.</p>
<p>In the United States, cartel operatives have been detected in 195 cities, as distant as Anchorage, Alaska, and as small as Ponca City, Okla., a report by the U.S. Justice Department said.</p>
<p>In Arizona, the Sinaloa Cartel has operations in Phoenix, Tucson, Douglas, Glendale, Naco, Nogales, Peoria, Sasabe, Sierra Vista and Yuma. The Gulf Cartel also has some operatives in Nogales, and the Juarez Cartel has outposts in Phoenix, Tucson and Douglas, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, the cartels are acquiring weapons that are &#8220;increasingly more powerful and lethal,&#8221; the U.S. Government and Accountability Office said in a June report.</p>
<p>Five rocket launchers, 271 grenades, 2,932 assault rifles, a submarine loaded with cocaine, and an anti-aircraft gun complete with blast shield were all seized by Mexican authorities between March 2008 and August 2009.</p>
<p>In September, traffickers fired an anti-tank rocket at soldiers while trying to free a comrade who had been detained.</p>
<p>The gangs also are getting better at carrying out coordinated, military-style operations.</p>
<p>On July 11 and 12, La Familia launched 15 attacks in eight cities on police stations and a police bus, killing 14 officers.</p>
<p>And on May 16, Gulf Cartel gunmen freed 53 prisoners in a commando-style raid on a prison in Zacatecas state.</p>
<p><b>Prolonged war</b></p>
<p>Calderón and the Obama administration insist that the Mexican government still has the upper hand against the cartels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A report by the U.S. Joint Forces Command warned in January 2009 that Mexico was ripe for a &#8220;rapid and sudden collapse&#8221; because of the drug cartels. And in a report to the West Point military academy, former U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said the cartels could &#8220;overwhelm the institutions of the state and establish de facto control over broad regions of northern Mexico&#8221; within eight years.</p>

		<p>Is there no one in Washington with enough courage to stand up and say, &#8220;build the fence and/or put armed military to keep the criminals out. Let the corrupt country of Mexico self-destruct. We owe them nothing. They are listed as the 11th wealthiest country. Won&rsquo;t someone care enough to say, &#8220;keep you people home. We are going to make E-verify mandatory for all businesses, we are going to stop the birthright travesty and we&rsquo;re going to immediately cease all benefits. Get ready, your people are coming home!&#8221; </p>

		<p>{&#8220;We have a serious problem, but the good news is that we&rsquo;re confronting it, and better yet, we&rsquo;re making progress,&#8221; Calderón told the ambassadors last month.}</p>
<p>How many times have we heard that kind of spin about something a short time before some kind of incident proves it is no more than a blatant lie?</p>
<p>As the rest of the world is wallowing in economic woes, with drastically falling revenues, which are getting worse with time, the cartels are richer than ever.  In fact they&rsquo;re so wealthy it has been estimated that they have, in effect, about 100,000 &#8220;soldiers&#8221; on the payroll, all armed to the teeth equipped with the same light weapons as a nation state.</p>
<p>Experts seem to be agreeing that the gangs could take over the entire country right now if they would quit squabbling and make a kind of pact that would result in a merger, under one leader.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to worry about recessions.  In fact, it&rsquo;s likely that their product is in greater demand the more economic misery there is in the US.  So, as US revenues decline, the cartel income continues to be as good or better than usual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been suggested that the US is going to have to eventually move on Mexico in order to prevent cartel takeover.  If they decide against such a measure beforehand, certainly they will do so if the country finally falls.  </p>
<p>So, if that situation occurs, where is the US going to get the money to pursue a multibillion dollar war campaign? Too, is it likely that once Mexicans are dying in the streets from US armaments, will the Mexicans here in the US give their allegiance to the US or Mexico?  Will they stand idly by as they see and hear of their fallen friends and family being regarded as collateral damage?  Will fighting in the US lead to total economic collapse if it occurs?</p>
<p>Such a precarious state of affairs for a once nearly homogeneous society.  In 50 years we have went from the strongest nation in the world, at the top in every category, to living on the brink 24/7.  And, I hate to mention it, but it&rsquo;s getting worse.</p>

		<p>The most simple solution to this problem would be to allow personal or small-time (like a co-op) production of whatever drug(s) people want to consume.  Make people self-sufficient (isn&rsquo;t that the &#8220;conservative&#8221; way?) and the market for foreign made drugs will disappear.  Don&rsquo;t tax it (to keep the prices down) until imports from places like Mexico virtually disappear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their product is also improving, the report said: Marijuana potency in 2008 was the highest it has ever been.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that for one minute.  I&rsquo;ve been reading it for years, nay decades.  Just a bunch of government propaganda from anti-drug hysteria.  Go read the book &#8220;Reefer Madness&#8221; (it&rsquo;s old, but a good read) to see just how dishonest our federal goverment has been about &#8220;drugs&#8221; (legal GOOD, illegal BAD).  The reason marjuana use was criminalized in the early 20th century was that poor, inner city immigrants were smoking it, according to that book.</p>

<p>Where does this guy live?? the drug cartels control Mexico NOW!! and everyone on the planet knows it, certainly those residents on both sides of the border areas. I also believe the cartels have inroads into our &#8220;own&#8221; congress, senate and various state legislatures which prevents any serious action being taken against the cartel hierarchy, and we KNOW WHO they are and WHERE they are at any time of the day.</p>

		<p>I disagree.  Mexico turning into a narco state is the perfect catalyst to turn the vast majority on Americans anti-immigrant.</p>
<p>Currently, the vast majority ride the fence.  Over 90% want illegals gone but maintain the US should legally import millions.</p>
<p>But a failed state in Mexico will destroy the lie of the hard working &#8220;migrant&#8221; coming here for a better life and replace it with the awakened truth that the vast majority of them are drug dealers coming here to rape, rob, murder and steal.</p>

		<p>This is not good at all. If Mexico collapses all hell will break loose here. Firstly, there will be a civil war in Mexico and we will have to commit troops to secure the border and to enter Mexico to re-establish governmental control. </p>
<p>Almost simultaneously there will be an exodus of millions of Mexicans across that border. If they are stopped, apprehended  or arrested there will be massive civil unrest among the millions of illegals that are already here. This will be greatly exacerbated by the perception they have of us as being a weak people.</p>
<p>This is a bomb waiting to go off. And it most likely will.</p>
<p>We have to vote out virtually every incumbent or career politician and send a loud and clear message if we are to have a chance. The time for organization and courageous, decisive action is fast approaching. </p>

		<p>I wish the white youth would become aware and stop embracing the drug culture. Their drug money is fueling violent, racist gangs at home and abroad. There is a 20 something &#8220;stoner&#8221; in my community who uses recreational drugs. He is a good kid going down the wrong path. He complained that he was once severely beaten by a savage gang of non-white thugs. I told him &#8220;when you do drugs, you make your attackers rich&#8221;. He responded positively and tried to stop doing drugs&hellip;but that didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>

		<p>#5 addressed this, and I&rsquo;ll state it in even stronger terms.  Legalize all drugs.  Then the prices will fall drastically, and the cartels will be out of business.  Nothing else is going to work!  The U.S. can&rsquo;t control drugs within its own borders, let alone anywhere else.  Prisons are bursting with drug criminals, and states are freeing violent felons to make room.  People are mugged and carjacked on the streets for crack money.  Home invasions are becoming commonplace.  We smartened up on the prohibition of liquor because of the crime that it caused, didn&rsquo;t we?  Let the druggies lie in their crack houses and get high all they want!</p>

		<p>The Mexican government has repeatedly complained to the US that the firearms being used by the cartels are purchased legally here and then smuggled south across the border, but this article mentions &#8220;rocket launchers&#8221;, &#8220;hand grenades&#8221; &#8220;a submarine&#8221; and &#8220;an anti-aircraft gun complete with blast shield&#8221; (neat - probably an old 20mm Oerlikon!), so I would be most interested in hearing a Mexican government representative explain exactly what American sporting goods stores sell these items.</p>
<p>The most likely non-Mexican sources for military weapons used by the cartels are farther south.  Nicaragua and El Salvador would be the best guesses; El Salvador had a long civil war, and Nicaragua was both over-armed by Cuba and the USSR and had an insurgency of its own.  Does anyone imagine these weapons merely evaporated once things became calmer down there?</p>

		<p>Well, its coming, soon enough we will see this sort of full scale narco warfare in this country. I have long been telling friends, family and coworkers that the threat to this country doesn&rsquo;t lie in Iraq or A-Stan, but at our Southern border. And yea most people just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>When it comes, hopefully they will stick to massacring their own, but I doubt it, and when they do go after American politicians, law enforcement and justice types, then maybe the average clueless American will wake up. Its unfortunate that this is what it will take.</p>

		<p>American tourists should completely boycott Mexico and go to some other country if they want to, or else visit vacation spots here. No sense in throwing out hard-earned dollars just to go to a country that can&rsquo;t protect them, and whose water will make them sick. Going to bullfights, Maya ruins or Tijuana donkey shows is not worth it.</p>
<p>Mexican officials and federales are shot, and Mexico blames our gun laws, and not their criminals. That&rsquo;s like blaming Haiti&rsquo;s troubles with food distribution, on the sacks of rice sent over from the USA. </p>

<p>I agree that certain American prisons are, as you say, &#8220;bursting with drug criminals.&#8221;  But there&rsquo;s a racial angle.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch had an editorial on Sunday that asked that Missouri should &#8220;act smarter&#8221; when it comes to crime.  Among the problems the Post notes is that rural Missouri judicial precincts disproportionately send far more many people to state prison for longer sentences given for lesser crimes than in urban areas.  Translated into English, it means that rural Missouri judges and juries, especially in Southern and Kraut Belt Missouri, are hanging judges and hanging juries, while in black/liberal St. Louis and Kansas City, you have juries loath to convict and judges who hand out light sentences.  In St. Louis City, one in five first time armed robbers get no prison time.</p>
<p>So put the two together, and Missouri state prisons are far whiter than they should be, with many whites in there on convictions such as third-time weed possession, in the same joints with black hard core murderers.  The cell that is occupied by that third time pot user from Farmington means that the black armed robber in North St. Louis City can&rsquo;t get sent to prison even if the judge would, b/c of the lack of hoosegow space.</p>

		<p>Ya know, compadres, these are the same Mexicans who refuse to learn English in the USA, only in their homeland they refuse to learn to organize, become patriots, and take their own country back!!  I mean, we had our Founding Fathers, who helped us win the Revolutionary War against the Brits; what&rsquo;s to stop these Mexicans from presenting a united front and winning?  Money?  Education?  Probably not the money, but education is a possibility.  Compulsory education in Mexico stops after grade 6.  Is their &#8220;legal&#8221; guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t capable of getting money together to hire ex-Marine snipers and other available military-trained folks who might enjoy being mercenaries?  Mexico has to get its act together and take care of its own problems.  Drug cartels have to be eliminated - they won&rsquo;t give up as there&rsquo;s too much money involved.  So the regular folks just have to figure out how best to get rid of &#8216;em.  It can&rsquo;t be all THAT hard&hellip;.  My cousin and spouse just moved to an ocean resort in Mexico - I TOLD &#8216;em it&rsquo;s a dumb move, but they wouldn&rsquo;t listen.  I am hoping not to lose them to the druggies.  But it could sure happen&hellip;. </p>
