<h1>Mistrial Blamed on One Juror</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Schmitt, Detroit Free Press, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sam Riddle has escaped conviction for now.</p>
<p>And, according to several jurors who spoke out angrily on the steps of the federal courthouse in Detroit after a mistrial was declared Wednesday in Riddle&rsquo;s public corruption trial, he has only one juror to thank  &mdash;  Angela Woods of Auburn Hills.</p>
<p>About a half-dozen of the 12-member panel lobbed extraordinary public accusations of racism against Woods, the sole African American on the jury, saying that she hijacked the process by being combative and confrontational, often refusing to review evidence and discuss possible verdicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried for five days. We were civil. If you tried to say anything, she would lash out at you,&#8221; juror Margaret Elyakin of Ann Arbor said. &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t find this man guilty, you can&rsquo;t find anyone guilty. Unfortunately, it came down to race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said Wednesday that her office plans to retry Riddle.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, but it&rsquo;s my opinion that &#8220;people of color&#8221; rarely possess the mentality or temperament to work within societal structures &mdash; such as the justice system &mdash; built up by white people over the centuries. There is a &#8220;disconnect&#8221; that no amount of effort or wishful thinking on the part of do-good white people can fix. And refusal to recognize the problem only makes it worse. </p>

		<p>This is intentional jury nullification once again.  This also happened in the trial of Orange Taylor over the rape and murder of Laura Dickinson.  The truly amazing part was that his defense at trial was that he had simply broken into the girl&rsquo;s dorm room, found her dead, masturbated on her corpse, stolen her property and left.  He was caught on tape leaving the room.  So not only did a black female juror give him the mistrial but the &#8220;black community&#8221; showed up to protest when charges were refiled.  Goes to show that so long as the victim is white anything is acceptable and blacks are always the victim in their eyes.</p>

		<p>I take it the defendant Riddle was black?  I am surprised, if the juror was consistently confrontative and combative, that they could not have replaced her.  I believe that can be done in CA.  But any attorney who can get a black woman on a jury when there&rsquo;s a black male defendant is like Johnny Cochran in OJ&rsquo;s trial   &mdash;   smart.  Black women will NEVER convict a black male defendant.</p>

		<p>this is not about temprement or intelligence. blacks refuse to convict blacks. race trump everything with these people. they should not be allowed to be on juries. they are not concerned with fairness or justice, they are consumed with hatred for whites, and destroying white established society in any way they can. it is their driving force.</p>

		<p>This happens every hour, of every day, of every week, of every month, of every year, in America.  This goes back to the fact that NO blacks EVER show up for jury duty.  You&rsquo;ve seen it, I&rsquo;ve seen it, They&rsquo;ve seen it.  I seem to get called every 3 years, to the day.  While I have just sat there, sometimes up to 6 hours, there has NEVER been a black person in the room, except a &#8220;court officer&#8221;.  Where did this one come from?  Although this quote says tons..&#8221;If you tried to say anything, she would lash out at you&rdquo;.  No sir, me, and EVERYBODY I know have never experienced such a thing!</p>

		<p>Here in Washington State we had two police officers killed by a educated black who worked in the high levels of Seattle government, whose &#8220;job&#8221; was a &#8220;political advocate&#8221; pushing Jury Nullification for ALL blacks. This will only get worse as more blacks find themselves unwilling to jail other blacks no matter what the crime.</p>

<p>The situation resulting from this corruption is the direct cause for the pending extermination of the white race.  The traitors within are the enemy soldiers.</p>

		<p>Another horrible example of where we are headed.  On a lighter note, Dave Chappelle, a black comedian poked fun at this very same issue on his sketch comedy show.  Chappelle was hilarious in the way that he was not afraid to ridicule his own people&rsquo;s negative &#8220;stereotypes.&#8221;  Personally, I find it a miracle that he was not severely chastised by his own people.  Anyway, the sketch was all about jury selection.  Chappelle was shown being selected for duty on the most famous trails of black defendants.  On each one he refused to admit ANY possibility that the defendant was guilty because they were the same race.  During the Michael Jackson case selection they reminded Chappelle of the overwhelming evidence against Jackson.  His reply:  &#8220;No way Michael did it.  No Way.  C&rsquo;mon, the man made &#8216;Thriller.&rsquo;  No way he did it man&#8221;  Sketch comedy that sounds quite plausible to me.</p>

		<p>In a trial by jury, your fate will be decided by 12 people, who weren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to get out of jury duty. Think about it. Plus, if you are white, and they are not, you will in all probability, be the loser. In a trial by a judge,which means a super liar, who was for the most part, educated in an institute of higher liberal learning. Right and wrong is not a deciding factor in court, only the rule of law, usually Murphy&rsquo;s law.</p>

		<p>There is a genetic difference between Europeans and Africans.</p>
<p>Europeans tend to use facts, evidence, and logic when making decisions.  This allows them to create efficiency, wealth, high standards of living, stable societies, and high culture.</p>
<p>Africans are driven more by emotion.  This leads to poor and illogical decisions, poverty, and social pathologies.  This is why it is nearly impossible to maintain a society that includes both Africans and Europeans.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Those of you who have never been on trial have no idea how corrupt the judges, court reporters and lawyers are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen to that!  In one of my hearings, the FBI agent assigned to my case said under oath that his agency had &#8220;absolutely no knowledge&#8221; that I had an &#8220;03 Curios and Relics&#8221; firearms collector&rsquo;s license, while attempting to demonize me as a gun nut.  In fact, the FBI did know that I had such a license, because they took the framed license off the wall of my den during the initial search of my home.  I never did get the frame back from them.  This little bit of felony perjury wasn&rsquo;t at an actual trial; it was at a hearing to determine whether I would be allowed out on bond.</p>

		<p>It is very true that a large majority, not all, but a large majority of Blacks will side with a Black defendant if the victim is White despite the evidence. Conversely, if a defendant is White and the victim is Black,  they&rsquo;ll find guilt, no  matter the evidence. OJ wasn&rsquo;t an anomly, what happend there happens all the time, it&rsquo;s just that he was a celebrity. </p>

		<p>This is a great example of the unworkability of the multiracial society.  Non-lawyers should know:  the law forbids lawyers from excluding jurors solely on grounds of race under Batson v. Kentucky.</p>
<p>So even a lawyer who knows that a black juror will sink his case&hellip; is sunk.  Better to lose the case than be accused of racism.</p>
<p>This also shows why blacks demand to be tried by black juries&hellip; they know they&rsquo;ll get off.  They&rsquo;re actually demanding a right to be found not guilty.</p>

		<p>Lots of good comments, folks.  I have no personal experience of the criminal justice system (and no desire to, either!) but have no doubt I would see what so many of you have described.  England&rsquo;s historic &#8220;trial by jury&#8221; system is predicated on a European cultural framework and in general an educated, Christian populace.  America no longer possesses either the framework or the populace - no wonder the system designed for such has broken down.  Decline and fall.</p>
