<h1>Suspect in Death of UNC Student Seeks to Bar Death Penalty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), February 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Defense attorneys for Demario Atwater, one of two suspects accused of murdering UNC-Chapel Hill student body president Eve Carson, have asked a federal judge to dismiss federal kidnapping and carjacking charges against the 23-year-old Durham man.</p>
<p>The lawyers also have asked the judge to rule out the possibility of the death penalty in the case, saying the prosecution&rsquo;s pursuit of the federal charges and capital punishment is unconstitutional and based on racial bias.</p>
<p>Atwater, who is black, is accused in state court of first-degree murder, kidnapping and other offenses in connection with the March 2008 fatal shooting of Carson, a white student leader widely admired on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;[B]oth statistics and comparison with other similarly situated defendants reveal that the overriding reason that Mr. Atwater was indicted in federal court was that he was a young, black male accused of killing a young, white female,&#8221; the defense team wrote in one of the documents.</p>
<p>Laurence Alvin Lovette Jr., a 19-year-old from Durham, also is accused of murder in the case. He is not charged in federal court, nor are prosecutors seeking the death penalty against him. At the time of the shooting, Lovette was 17, deemed too young by the U.S. Supreme Court for prosecutors to seek his execution.</p>
<p>In the 24-county federal court district where Atwater is charged, there were 1,098 murders committed from 1998 to 2007 in which a firearm was used, according to documents filed in federal court this week. Atwater&rsquo;s case is only the second case in which death was a possible penalty brought in the federal district that includes Orange and Durham counties, the defense lawyers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to seeking dismissal of the charges, defense lawyers also have asked for a judge to throw out any statements Atwater made to police during their investigation, saying he was &#8220;coerced&#8221; and under duress.</p>
<p>They also are seeking any videotape from the Chapel Hill police interview and booking rooms. And, they want any videotape the Durham patrol cars that transported Atwater and Shanita Love, a woman with whom the suspect once lived who &#8220;is likely to be a critical witness against the defendant,&#8221; according to defense documents.</p>

<p>The overriding reason for the indictment in federal court was kidnapping.</p>
<p>Maybe young, black males should stop murdering so many young, white females, or anybody else for that matter, in order to avoid death penalties.</p>

		<p>Whites are far more likely to be put to death for their crimes than blacks, that much is a fact, yet every time a black defendant is facing the death penalty they allow defense lawyers to outright lie and claim some racial bias in it&rsquo;s application.  Since now you must have the requisite number of blacks on every jury involving black defendants, prosecutors are just happy to get a conviction and often don&rsquo;t even try for the death penalty in the most horrific crimes.  </p>

<p>The reason Mr. Atwater was indicted in Federal court was that the U.S. Attorneys suspect that a carjacking was involved, and while I can&rsquo;t figure how carjacking is a Federal object, it is a Federal object until a court declares it unconstitutional or Congress removes jurisdiction over that crime.  Because a suspected murder was committed in the course of the carjacking, the young black male that Mr. Atwater is might get a syringe dose of the Hooiser Hospitality in Terre Haute, Indiana some time in next two decades.</p>

		<p>The reason this case is in FedCourt is because it would almost be immpossible to get a death penalty jury conviction with a jury pool exclusively from ultra-liberal Orange County in a state court trial. The NC Eastern District Fedcourt has a much more &#8220;diverse&#8221; jury pool than Orange County.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that the defense&rsquo;s preposterous claims about racial bias are correct, and that the defendant&rsquo;s crime is being treated more severely because he&rsquo;s a Black man accused of murdering a White woman. Firstly, if that were true, there&rsquo;d be a hell of a lot more Black men on death row than there are, considering this nation&rsquo;s outrageous Black-on-White, violent crime rate. Secondly, the government could:</p>
<p>A. Execute fewer guilty Black murderers to close the gap.<br>
B. Execute more guilty White murderers to close the gap.<br>
C. Do a little bit of both to close the gap.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;ll go with choice B, since I have no sympathy for such despicable persons in the first place. That would still suggest that this defendant deserves the three-shot coctail, if guilty as charged. Of course, to top off their dubious efforts, the defense is claiming that a Black person who confessed to a heinous crime was merely coerced into confessing. Haven&rsquo;t we all heard this ridiculous claim a time or two (or three) in the past?</p>

		<p>This hypocritical statement:<br>
<i>&ldquo;[B]oth statistics and comparison with other similarly situated defendants reveal that the overriding reason that Mr. Atwater was indicted in federal court was that he was a young, black male accused of killing a young, white female,&rdquo; the defense team wrote in one of the documents.</i></p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe that. Know what I believe? I believe that the overriding reason <b>that his defense team seeks to bar the death penalty</b> is that he was a young, black male accused of killing a young, white female.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you see the hypocrisy of all of this? They decry the racial undertones of this case, but their primary reason for barring the death penalty? He was a black male who killed a white female. Thus he should NOT be put to death  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s their line of reasoning. Hey, if he was white, why not, no qualms about that. But blacks have had a rough past life, why not let them ruthlessly murder white men, women and children with impunity. No problem with making ends meet.</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me the most about that statement quoted above is that they&rsquo;re implying that black males should have more leniency when being prosecuted for murdering white women primarily because they are black. It scares me to death what blacks will be able to get away with in the future.</p>

<p>With all due respect, this hijo de puta deserves only a ONE shot coctail; a .45 ACP round right through his frontal lobe: preferably delivered by a member of the Carson family as this mutant is being led into the courthouse.<br>
This trial will be another travesty in which this mutant will be allowed to live on.</p>
<p>Poor beautiful Eve! If only she had has someone who could have given her a clue about the realities of living with Blacks. <br>
She was another victim of our educational system.  <br>
May she, Lauren Burk, Anne Pressley, Channon Christian and the thousands of other young White female victims of Black predations<br>
rest in Peace. If there IS no heaven, I hope that at least there&rsquo;s a Hell for their murderers.</p>

		<p>Very troubling news from Chapel Hill just out. No African Americans were awarded the Eve Carson memorial scholarships last month. Both recipients look like the same European American White Race as was Privileged White Eve Carson. Why must the white people perpetuate injustice? We must show more willingness to root out unacknowledged biases against students of color at UNC. If UNC had given more free scholarships to the African American community in Durham, her killers would have been in the library reading Dante and Shakespeare instead of out killing her.</p>
<p>http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/content/unc-juniors-named-eve-carson-scholars</p>
<p><br>
When Eve Carson was kidnapped, robbed, and shot five times by these two &#8220;promising but troubled young African American men&#8221;, a Council of Conservative Citizens website revealed that she had worshipped at the altar of the multicult diversity when she was running for president of the UNC student body. She was elected, so her prayers paid off. (Didn&rsquo;t a more deserving minority miss their opportunity for leadership because Eve Carson refused to admit her unearned white privilege and withdraw from the election at the perfect moment so the minority would win the presidency they deserved?)</p>
<p>When Eve ran for UNC student president, she advertised her UNITAS Diversity Theme Housing activity. </p>
<p> http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/06/eve-carson-unc-chapel-hi_n_90286.html</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you just wonder how many times she praised Diversity when her kidnappers, robbers and killers were driving her around Chapel Hill at the point of a gun? </p>
<p>Will the prosecutor remember to ask the defendants at the upcoming murder trials &#8220;Did sweet little Miss Carson explain to you how Diversity makes us stronger? Did she promise to help your community join together with UNC students in building a more hopeful, democratic, and diverse society? Did she explain to you how embarrassed she was that UNC hasn&rsquo;t removed its Confederate monument from campus? Did she tell you how hopeful she was about the future of race relations and a new era of responsibility because UNC does not include its Confederate monument on campus maps?&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Diversity worshipping Miss Carson encountered the Diversity up close and personally, that authentic &#8220;we be kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221;<br>
 kind of diversity, and she didn&rsquo;t survive the encounter. </p>
<p>Do you think any white students at UNC got the obvious message? Never. </p>
<p>They probably blamed her death on themselves for their not caring enough about the persistence of race and class inequalities. Her death probably made them all pledge to do more to eradicate racism and classism. They all probably  took an oath to never say she was &#8220;murdered&#8221; or &#8220;shot&#8221; or &#8220;killed&#8221;, only that she had died under unfortunate circumstances that force us all to confront the racism and classism that still lingers like a deadly cancer in our society. They probably all agreed if those white lacrosse players at Duke hadn&rsquo;t raped that innocent African American stripper, what?, it was all a hoax?, a lie?, well, that doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because white college boys are still mostly racists, unless they say &#8220;diversity&#8221; as often as high school girls say &#8220;like&#8221;.</p>
<p>The UNC student body did not raise up in mass outraged anger at her killers&rsquo; not being charged with a Hate Crime after they shot her FIVE TIMES! The most obvious question that no UNC student even knows how to ask is &#8220;Did her African American kidnappers, robbers, and killers know that she was a WHITE GIRL?&#8221;</p>
<p>How can you shoot someone, anyone, FIVE TIMES, and not be charged with a hate crime? What was it, a crime of passion? Do the prosecutors just understand that when blacks kill whites, it&rsquo;s never a hate crime, but it might just be  an understandable and   passionate &#8220;acting out&#8221; in response to racial oppression and injustice? </p>
<p>The undeniable fact of afrovoodoo crimes against White American Citizens that is never discussed is that the  AFROVOODOOS  KNOW  THEIR  VICITIMS  ARE  WHITE!!!</p>
<p>Get it?</p>

		<p>Correction. You can find the UNC Confederate monument on at least one online campus map, without the word &#8220;Confederate&#8221;, just &#8220;Silent Sam&#8221;.

		<p>I cannot imagine the anguish the Christian, Newsom and Carson families must be going through watching defense attorneys defending and making excuses for the sub-humans that viciously murdered their young son and daughters. Both black murderers of Eve Carson, and the murderers of Channon and Christopher deserve no pity, no mercy, only the death penalty, administered swiftly, nothing less.  </p>
<p>If anything is to be learned from the Eve Carson and Christian/ Newsom cases, it is that Whites should arm and be ready at all times to defend themselves with deadly force against predatory blacks.</p>
<p>All Whites should become familiar with and pass along the following crime statistics to those they care about:  </p>
<p> &ldquo; &hellip;  blacks are 39 times more likely to commit violent crimes against whites than the reverse, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery&hellip; blacks commit, on average, 15,400 black-on-white rapes per year, while whites average only 900&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>You will want to mention that these statistics are from the Department Justice and the FBI.</p>
<p>We Whites have suffered enough at the hands of black criminals and we know the anti-White media will not warn us about predatory blacks that target our young daughters for rapes, our people for robbery and murder, our children for brutal attacks.</p>
<p>You might meet some resistance at first from brain-washed Whites, who were taught in government schools and shown by CSI that only Whites are violent and it is they who commit most crimes, especially against non-Whites.  You must be persistent to overcome the media lies and make sure your loved ones avoid blacks and are wary and on guard at all times if they must be around them, lest you find yourself in court in the position of Eve, Channon or Christopher&rsquo;s loved ones, watching as surly blacks use &#8216;racism&rsquo; to excuse their heinous, murderous behavior.</p>
<p>And finally, remember the words of the late Harry Bowne:</p>
<p>&#8220;Handguns are a girl&rsquo;s best friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>O, how right he was.</p>

		<p>Recall that juries, not judges, must impose death penalties.  And, though black juries will often vote guilty in murder cases against blacks, there are too many instances where they will not vote for execution.  They believe the leftist propaganda about the white bogeyman.  Check into some of the most recent notorious cases of aggravated murder where the convicted got only life, and you&rsquo;ll find black jurors.  </p>

		<p>The conclusion is thus, nutty educational system, nutty legal system, and a nutty country.  While nobody deserves to be put through what Eve Carson was put through, from what I have gleaned in the reading of several articles about this situation, she was quite the multicultural diva.  She was, certainly, no positive influence or encouragement or inspiration to/for her own people (European Americans/Europeans).  With the liberal mindset Ms. Carson indulged; there is actually no telling what damage the young lady had caused and instilled to others of her own.  What is truly tragic is to contemplate what a constructive encouragement and confident power this young lady could have been for her own people: She was talented and intelligent but her motivation was totally misguided.  Now, if Mr. Demario Atwater receives the death penalty, he sits in prison for 40 years as appeals creep through a broken legal system.  And, if Demario Atwater is barred from receiving the death penalty, he sits in prison for 40 years as appeals, again, creep through a broken legal system.  The cliché states, six to one, half-dozen to another.               </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a federal case because of the kidnapping charge.  All kidnapping defendants cases are presumed to have taken their victims across state lines.  Therefore, all kidnapping cases are initially considered federal cases (under the jurisdiction of the FBI) and can be tried in federal court.</p>

<p>Kidnapping was involved which is a federal crime. A kidnapped person need not be taken across state lines, only TAKEN against their will to make it a federal kidnapping charge. The feds do not always accept the cases though.</p>
