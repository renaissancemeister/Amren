<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/us/09walmart.html?th&amp;emc=th">Immigrants Claim Wal-Mart Fired Them to Provide Jobs for Local Residents</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Frosch, New York Times, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small group of West African men who came to the Rockies in search of economic opportunity are embroiled in a dispute with Wal-Mart, accusing it of a raft of discriminatory actions. Most say they were dismissed because supervisors wanted to give their jobs to local people in need of work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In January 2009, six complainants said, a new manager at the Avon store called a meeting of workers  &mdash;  virtually all West African  &mdash;  and said: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like some of the faces I see here. There are people in Eagle County who need jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three other men, who worked at the Glenwood Springs store, said in the complaint that an assistant manager there, also new, had made a similar comment at a meeting of mostly West African workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All 10 complaints also stated that West African workers, who are Muslim, were refused short prayer breaks. White and Hispanic workers, they said, were permitted unscheduled cigarette breaks.</p>

		<p>Obviously Walmart is being run differently than when I was an employee. Breaks were scheduled and you used the bathroom on your break. Unscheduled smoke breaks Walmartians clocked out to smoke. Five prayer breaks per day. I bet the Walmart management were sick of that by the first week.<br>

		<p>I think we can all agree that there is some logic to banning discrimination based on race, sex or religion, even if you do not believe they should be on the books.  But &#8220;national origin&#8221; always baffled me.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be allowed to favor our fellow country men over foreigners?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of jobs in West Africa. Maybe go back and get a job with one of the Chinese firms that are moving in. If the same West Africans were back where they belong, they would complain about Indians coming in and taking their jobs. <br>
I hope Walmart really is replacing these guys with local workers. </p>

		<p>No wonder American business is failing. If such companies have to shell out millions of dollars every year to complaining blacks, what funds are left to cover taxes, overhead and other expenses?</p>
<p>What are these black muslims doing in a fairly rural part of Colorado anyway? I&rsquo;m sure that one would be hard-pressed to find a mosque there.  I&rsquo;m also sure that the Walmart in the Washington DC area would love to have them; immigrants are all that work at Walmarts there.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that a supervisor would never say something like they claim he did.  The West Africans must be illegal aliens.  How and where did they come here?</p>

		<p>2 Istvan:</p>
<p>Egalitarianism is not a calling that tolerates squeamishness.  Karl Marx once called civil rights &#8220;a revolution in permanence,&#8221; because there would always be some sort of -ism to be fought.  It stands to reason that if you can&rsquo;t discriminate based on gender, race and religion, then what&rsquo;s a little ole pesky national border or country of birth between friends?  The anti-racist who deplores racial discrimination when it comes to domestic racial minorities would also demand non-discrimination based on citizenship status.</p>

<p>#2 Istvan! I absolutely disagree with you on this, respectfully disagree of course. I am all for discrimination on the basis of the Muslim religion, it should not be allowed to fester in the U.S. it will be, and is nothing but trouble, and the whining from the black converts is unbelievable because NOW they get the religious and racial cards to play whenever they want. I have other reasons for wanting the Muslim faith out of America, I have seen it face to face here in the Muddled East and the subsequent treatment of women and others NOT Muslim, especially in Saudi and Kuwait&hellip;Afghanistan is just terrible for the women since we Americans have little social interaction with the Afghans there is little opportunity for them to abuse us. Saudi and Kuwait don&rsquo;t really abuse Americans because they need us at the moment but they are actively trying to get as many Muslims into America for their own insidious and seditious purposes. </p>

<p>I agree, even in the military, to criticize a black is a career killer.  Especially if the much feared racist charge is levied, instant career killer and of course this applies to the civilian world too. And, there are any number of ways African blacks get to America..they can have AIDS, political &#8220;refuge&#8221; war refugee, hunger refuge or last but not least, have &#8220;relatives&#8221; in the U.S. with the resultant chain migration we all love so much.</p>

		<p>The sad thing is that many of these Africans will be back at Walmart because many of the locals will quit because it is common knowledge that Walmart treats its employees like trash. The reason for this is simple, the Africans tend to keep the jobs there and as a result, Walmart, like other business will be forced to accomodate their prayer breaks by providing them a room where they can do their prayers on work time.</p>

		<p>Why would anyone employ these &#8220;workers&#8221; in the first place.  They will cause all sorts of trouble &amp; disruptions with their foreign cultures &amp; ways.  Ends up costing everyone a lot of money, time &amp; agravation not to mention getting the locals unemployed up in arms. Mind you employing them from time to time may just keep the locals on their toes &amp; operating a little sharper!!!</p>

		<p>Perhaps he thought they might belong to one of those West African &#8220;secret socities&#8221;:</p>
<p><br>
<i> I remember the story of one woman whose soldier husband came back home one day, called her to one side and announced that he had joined a secret society for the advancement of his career, and one of the initiation rites required that he sleep with his teenage daughter. Hi wife was silent. Then she said: &ldquo;wait for me one moment, I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; When she returned, she was carrying his gun. She chased him out of the house and out of their lives. If the story is true, then that is a real woman, not like those fakes who keep silent about abuses of their children because they want to stay married.</i></p>

These West Africans are angry because East Indians are taking away their jobs but fail to understand that Americans can have similar sentiments too.<br>

Why don&rsquo;t these West Africans return to Africa and do the jobs Asian foreigners are doing? They want to be allowed to settle in the lands of other people but want to keep their own lands to themselves.</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t WalMart open up some new stores on the West coast of Africa so these misfits have no need to emigrate to the States. Any store they&rsquo;d open though would be opened to all sorts of corruption and shop lifting. Refused &#8220;prayers&#8221;, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to hire the misfits as their productivity would be low. It&rsquo;s like WM has hired the shop lifters.</p>

		<p>Go visit the Whiter regions of America. Who does the work? NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. I was in a town in Vermont. Bennington College was just down the road. All the workers were NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN. The workers at 7-11 were all WHITE.</p>
<p>I was in a town in Wisconsin..Janesville Wisconsin. All the workers were WHITE. Everyone who worked in the hospital :all WHITE.</p>
<p>If the immigration ehnthusiasts and post-1965 nonwhites had their way, they would force these NATIVE BORN WHITE workers out of these jobs and then claim that economists have demonstrated statistically that that immigrants create jobs rather than steal jobs. There is going to be a very explosive situation in future. Very explosive.</p>
<p>That Native Born White Americans are having their jobs and wages stolen by post-1965 nonwhites is obvious. Just ask the NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS who are the victims of this job theft. I could care less about what the economists think.</p>
<p>The massive greed of the Greedy Cheating Class is the force behind the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMEICANS.</p>
<p>There is no economic justification for importing even one nonwhite LEGAL IMMIGRANT.</p>

		<p>7  &mdash;  SKIP: I agree.  My whole point was that a logical argument could be made against discrimination based on traits that have no bearing on the job in question.  Does it really matter what race a ditch digger is as long as he comes to work and digs the ditch?  I am, however, a proponent of freedom of association for private inidividuals and firms.  Only the government should have to be even handed with its citizens, and only its OWN citizens.</p>

		<p>The reason why Saudi Arabia and Kuwait do not abuse Americans, Australians and Europeans is that they need their knowledge in order to find and sell their oil. They need them to work as skilled professionals in their hospitals and their schools. They have no respect for the Filipinos, Sri Lankans, and Malaysians who clean their homes, cook and take care of their kids. This is why many maids have run away from their employers and have instead stayed in their countries embassy until they can get a new passport and return flights back home.</p>
