<h1>French Identity No Longer Open to Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Sachs, Globe and Mail (Toronto), February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It started with a bang and ended with a committee.</p>
<p>Four months ago, the French government opened a grand collective discussion about national identity. It quickly evolved into a nasty quarrel over whether immigrants, and particularly Muslim immigrants, are French enough.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister François Fillon essentially shelved the debate, saying he would ask a committee of &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; to ruminate on the subject and report back in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;The debate was exemplary,&#8221; he announced after a closed-door meeting of the full French cabinet. &#8220;The question of the identity of France is no longer a taboo question.&#8221;</p>
<p>But critics across the political spectrum said the government opened a Pandora&rsquo;s box in setting up a website for people to weigh in on what it means to be French and organizing more than 350 public hearings across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a fine subject, but the way it was handled ended up creating a monster and a lot of racist excesses,&#8221; said Patrick Lozès, president of the Representative Council of Black Associations.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s website, for example, proved a popular success, with some 55,000 comments posted on it since October. But 15 per cent of the posts had to be removed because they were racist, xenophobic or otherwise inappropriate.</p>
<p>Eric Besson, the Minister of Immigration and National Identity, said he never meant for the debate to focus on immigrants or on French Muslims, another common theme in the sometimes strident public hearings.</p>
<p>But from the start, that subtext was raised in his suggested talking points for the debate, which included the question, &#8220;Should we control immigration in order to preserve our national unity?&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate took place against the backdrop of an equally divisive discussion over the niqab, the face-covering veil worn by some Muslim women. A parliamentary commission has recommended that women wearing the garment be banned from public transport, hospitals and government buildings. A group of deputies from the governing rightwing party wants to outlaw the wearing of it in all public places.</p>
<p>A TNS Sofres poll published last week suggested that the French are generally worried about the impact of immigration. Asked if there is a French identity, 23 per cent of those surveyed answered no. But the majority or respondents said it exists, needs to be strengthened and is under threat from immigrants from different cultures.</p>
<p>The roots of the national identity debate go back to 2007, when newly elected President Nicolas Sarkozy said the French needed to show more respect for their values and national symbols.</p>
<p>With regional elections looming in March, Mr. Fillon revived those themes at the same time as he dispatched the larger question of national identity for further study.</p>
<p>He said the government will ensure that all schools fly the French flag by the start of the next school year and that the 1789 Declaration of Human Rights is posted in every classroom &#8220;to cultivate pride in being French.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government will also require foreigners to prove their proficiency in French and sign a contract of rights and responsibilities in order to get French citizenship, he said.</p>
<p>Much of what Mr. Fillon is proposing is already in place. Since 2003, anyone seeking a work visa, residence status or naturalization has to speak French. For the past three years, they have also had to complete a course in French culture and values and prove that they have integrated into French society.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, the government decided to bury the debate on national identity,&#8221; said Harlem Désir, a spokesman for the opposition Socialist Party. &#8220;These are insignificant measures to make people believe that it actually served a purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the national identity debate, some government ministers proposed more-explicit requirements for foreigners, including a pledge that they will not wear or force anyone to wear the full Islamic veil.</p>
<p>Mr. Besson proposed that each French boy and girl be required to sign a &#8220;rights and duties charter&#8221; at 18 and that the government revoke the visa of any foreigner who breaches what he called French values.<br>

<p>&ldquo;The debate was exemplary,&rdquo; he announced after a closed-door meeting of the full French cabinet. &ldquo;The question of the identity of France is no longer a taboo question.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>What obviously contradictory nonsense.</p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s never &#8220;taboo&#8221; to have &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; discuss any dangerous topic as &#8220;intellectual&#8221; is always a designation awarded solely on the basis of ideological affiliation!  These &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; will simply decide, after a moment&rsquo;s delibera- err, &#8220;rumination&#8221; - that the public is ignorant and racist and just can&rsquo;t see the truth behind the ideals to which they so perfervidly hold, but are utterly incapable of explaining. </p>
<p>The public just can&rsquo;t see the Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes. </p>
<p>Poor racists.  </p>

<p>Unlike the United States, where no such debate is permitted in the first place.  It&rsquo;d be Racist, don&rsquo;t you know?</p>
<p>The Left&rsquo;s noisy desire for &#8220;Democracy&#8221; quickly evaporates when it becomes clear that the democratic majority is not Leftist.<br>

<p>Confirmation of what we all know. The self-proclaimed &#8216;intellecutuals&rsquo; and elites are going to by-pass the common sense and will of the majority and presumably &#8216;do what&rsquo;s right&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Yes, we are free and encouraged to discuss ideas and express our views, but ONLY those ideas and views that are sanctioned by the governemnt. Alternative views or ideas will NOT be permitted.  This is one of the first signs of a totalitarian government   &mdash;   i.e., Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Kim Jong-il, Idi Amin, etc.<br>

<p>A quarter of the population!  I&rsquo;m not at all surprised by that statistic.   With each generation, there are ever fewer &#8220;French&#8221; people left in France.  It has become a composite of Europe   &mdash;  - and now the world.  France has been a &#8220;proposition nation&#8221; and a melting pot for at least  a couple of centuries &hellip;.since the Revolution at least, and even before that, starting with Marie de Medici and Cardinal Mazarin.  Well before the USA even existed!  I don&rsquo;t know why this simple fact of history is unmentionable. </p>
<p>In a metropolis like Paris or Marseille, you have everybody from everywhere.  The united nations!  For generations, Paris has been a magnet for population. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a majority there are not native French or of French <b><i>descent </i></b>(by which I mean having at least French grandparents). </p>

<p>There is no way a Muslim can adapt to a civilized society, they change said society or try to blow it up..and the futility of trying to or expecting African black Muslims to be civilized is laughable to tears.  A religious conflagration is coming to EU.</p>

		<p>The liberal elite is always engaging in this sort of censorship.  They believe in free speech and free debate so long as you agree with them.  They are nasty little totalitarians at the core.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m certain of it&rsquo;s this:  The French elites live well removed from the diversity they impose on everyone else, just as the American elites do here.</p>

		<p>99% of non-White people living in France can ever be French. On people of French ancestry and other White people can become French. People of different races have different tastes, instincts and abilities.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know just exactly what those values, duties and such are. All this talk about it, but no explicit description of what they&rsquo;re talking about!</p>

		<p>My own viewpoints, at times, do more harm than good, as extreme as they can sometimes be, but clearly a movement is afoot to embarass the anti-immigrant crowd, by making outrageous or embarrassing comments in the guise of being an anti-immigration activists. Honesty has never been a strongpoint of the left. Sometimes when I read about these &#8216;crackdowns&rsquo; I wonder if it&rsquo;s a good thing. I think it was Orwell who said in times of universal deceat telling the truth would be a revolutionary act.</p>

If THIS is the intellect and/or backbone of Western leaders, then the West simply deserves to die.<br>
Such screaming, demented irony and cowardice is like having a conference on mathematics, yet stating it was in no way intended that NUMBERS would be discussed. Math must not be associated with numbers, you see!<br>
But that&rsquo;s PC for you, basically a bullet in the brain, a dagger in the heart, a pill that melts the mind and crushes the spirit.</p>
