<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Angela Freeman moved to Pennsauken in the mid-1980s, she was among a wave of black teachers hired to reflect the township&rsquo;s changing racial demographics.</p>
<p>The idea was that African American educators could better relate to the small but growing number of black students at the high school. Freeman felt welcome enough, but she noticed that any discussion of race was conducted in code, with teachers and administrators avoiding words like black and white.</p>
<p>It was always &#8220;the school is changing,&#8221; Freeman said. &#8220;One day I said, &#8216;What do you mean?&rsquo; and there was silence. But I knew what they meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>These days, the Camden County inner-ring suburb  &mdash;  where minorities, including significant numbers of Latinos and Asians, are now half of the population  &mdash;  is engaged in a public discussion about the role of race in its future.</p>
<p>The issue is how to stanch the outflow of the town&rsquo;s white residents while creating a welcoming environment for everyone.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, residents began an effort to try to stem the &#8220;white flight&#8221; that had afflicted many U.S. cities in the 1960s and &rsquo;70s and was threatening Pennsauken. The strategy, as refined over the years: Market the town&rsquo;s diversity as an asset.</p>
<p>Tours led by the township for prospective residents emphasize Pennsauken&rsquo;s multiculturalism, and new-resident meetings encourage interaction across racial and class lines.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1980, white residents accounted for 91 percent of Pennsauken&rsquo;s population. By 2000, 60 percent of the town&rsquo;s 36,000 residents were white. In those 20 years, there had been a doubling of minority residents, drawn by the same relatively low property taxes and proximity to Philadelphia that had attracted families for decades.</p>
<p>In 1994, at the height of the white exodus  &mdash;  and the year the township elected its first black councilman  &mdash;  local residents Lynn Cummings and Harold Adams created the grassroots group Neighbors Empowering Pennsauken (NEP) to improve relations between established residents and the minority families moving in.</p>
<p>In 2001, the township created a commission on integration, phased out NEP, and committed public money to billboards and other efforts designed to market Pennsauken&rsquo;s diversity to white families looking for an alternative to more homogenous suburbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were asking why I, a black man, wanted more white people living here. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy sell,&#8221; said Adams, 50, a real estate assessor. &#8220;We were coming at it from a practical standpoint.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to studies, he said, the market value of homes tends to decline as more minorities move into a neighborhood. That translates into lower revenue from property taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a town gets below 50 percent white, it makes it very difficult for the town to maintain services,&#8221; Adams said.</p>
<p>That spiraling down is mostly the result of paranoia, says Nathaniel Norment Jr., chairman of the African American Studies department at Temple University.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s created based on white people&rsquo;s fear of being close to black people,&#8221; Norment said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s this myth we have that blacks&rsquo; moving in will change the social environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people of color had feelings that if whites wanted to leave and not live next to people of color, you should let them do as they want to do,&#8221; said resident Darlene Hannah-Collins, 53, who is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a 2008 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the township&rsquo;s white population has declined by 22 percent since 2000. The census conducted this year will be more definitive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When you see the low property values, you can figure people of color are living there,&#8221; Dobson [Eric Dobson, a planning consultant who has done work for the township and sits on the school board] said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s troubling when you have an overwhelming number of one particular race buying in a place. That&rsquo;s the sign of moving toward segregation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of Pennsauken High students failed to meet basic proficiency standards in math last year and 34 percent failed to do so in English  &mdash;  5 and 7 percentage points below the state averages. School officials attributed the scores to the influx of students who had not passed through Pennsauken&rsquo;s elementary and middle school programs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this myth we have that blacks&rsquo; moving in will change the social environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, a myth.  Aside from the falling test scores cited at the bottom, there is always, always the inevitable increase in crime, in addition to the more minor annoyances of increased noise, blacks standing around in groups a blocking the paths of everyone else and other intimidation tactics (nasty stares, etc.)  </p>
<p>Real estate values fall because no one wants to live near them.  No one wants to work with them.  No one wants them as customers.  </p>

<p>Thinking that blacks&rsquo; moving in will NOT change the social environment and calling the social transformation a myth, is why this mentally challenged man will never understand what the real world is all about.  </p>
<p>It is these kinds of views from blacks that so disturb white people, because they blaringly reveal that blacks just don&rsquo;t get it, and they regard anybody who can&rsquo;t see deplorable black behavior, black crime and violence, and crude, loud, disgusting attitudes, as typical of the black mindset, and they want to move as far away from blacks as they can get.</p>
<p>They not only want us to stay in order to keep things running, but they want us to take their abuse without complaining.</p>
<p>For the most part, blacks are children who are incapable of creating and maintaining an efficient society. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s racial profiling.  Any time non whites recognize that there are some benefits to living among whites, such as easy victims of robbery, rape, and murder, as well as punitive property taxes on white residents, then non whites are racially profiling whites for particular kinds of treatment based on race.</p>
<p>Eric Holder testified that the hate crimes laws were only intended to protect certain classes of minorities. Even though the black thugs who racially profiled and then attacked and killed white Julie Love, white Shannon Christian, white Eve Carson, white Emily Haddock, white Anne Pressley,  and white Kristen Warneke, they will not be charged with hate crimes because these white girls were not the protected class, but they were the targeted class, just like your white mothers, sisters, and daughters are.</p>
<p>Blacks racially profile whites through targeted violence by afrovoodoo thugs and targeted taxation by  privileged afrovoodoo politicians.<br>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, and it&rsquo;s all a social construct, and if you think the races are fundamentally equal, which I&rsquo;m sure most of the players in this article will claim they believe, then why does it matter where white people are or aren&rsquo;t?</p>

		<p>  &#8220;We were coming at it from a practical point.&#8221;  Does it occur to him that the people who were leaving were acting from a &#8220;practical point&#8221; also? If the increased presence of blacks in the neighborhood made conditions better, or at least didn&rsquo;t make them any worse, does he think people would go through all the hassle of changing residences, many of them leaving the place they were born?  Does he think that they want to have to drive further back and forth to work, or even change jobs? For all their talk about transparency, &#8220;open dialogue&#8221;  and addressing the issues, blacks don&rsquo;t want to see or discuss the elephant in the room, or in this case the neighborhood: when blacks move in in numbers, the quality of life invariably goes down, and those who are productive and law abiding, black and white, want to get the heck out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a myth Norment. Face it; blacks are overrepresented in virtually every social pathology in America. They are far more likely than anyone else to commit crime. That&rsquo;s reason enough for whites to want to keep their distance. Furthermore it&rsquo;s perfectly normal for anyone to want to be around people of their own race. If blacks were tested for their willingness to move beyond race they&rsquo;d fail miserably. People need to stop holding whites to a higher standard. </p>

		<p>Blacks are the true &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While they exaggerate and outright lie about &#8216;white racism&rsquo; and &#8216;hate&rsquo;, they do everything they can to be around whites because they see whites as their only hope.</p>
<p>However, proximity to whites is not working to improve their overall condition. Being near whites can&rsquo;t help them bridge thousands of years of evolution.</p>

<p><b>Paranoia? I think not. Try reality, Mr. Norment.</b> </p>
<p>When a city becomes a mini-Detroit, the social environment WILL change because all the social ills that white families dread end-up right in their neighborhood: an increase in crime, poor schools, low property values, inefficient government services, and a lack of a cohesive community.</p>
<p>Perhaps the last paragraph in this article said it best:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-six percent of Pennsauken High students failed to meet basic proficiency standards in math last year and 34 percent failed to do so in English &mdash; 5 and 7 percentage points below the state averages.&#8221; <br>

<p>It is amazing some people see losing White folks as a threat, but do not see an increase in minorities as a threat. I would like to see these people walk through nearby Camden at night, or certain areas of nearby Philadelphia after dark. They will see Pennsauken&rsquo;s future when the minority is the majority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a town gets below 50 percent white, it makes it very difficult for the town to maintain services,&rdquo; Adams said.&#8221;</p>
<p>No kidding. When the number of freeloading blacks outnumber the White working class, it is difficult to maintain the lifestyle of  the black underclass. This article is basically saying that minorities can&rsquo;t survive without hard working Whites to support them. Unfortunately, the article uses classic misdirection by blaming &#8220;White flight&#8221; instead laying the blame where it belongs, on under performing minorities.</p>

<p>How utterly laughable, Comrade Adams!</p>
<p>Any entity that is majority white, that falls below the 75% to 70% white baseline, it is in real trouble of becoming a minority gutted chunk of wreckage. That is almost like a law of nature; or put another way, sell &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;multiculturalism&rdquo; as tenaciously as you like when engaging in real estate &ldquo;development,&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t honestly expect equally &ldquo;vibrant&rdquo; enrichment in return.</p>
<p>Live in a fantasy world if you must, but do not expect others (particularly the whites you demand a free lunch from) to do the same. The reality is that for whites approaching anything other than a 70% majority status, life becomes a living hell. You see, nonwhites as a minority of anything greater than 30% do not just &ldquo;change the social environment,&rdquo; they destroy it like a rainbow atomic bomb.</p>
<p>It is at the 30% or greater mark, that nonwhites make their ridiculous demands for extra-&ldquo;equality&rdquo; and begin to act as abhorrently vicious as they can, to &ldquo;get what is coming to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>So in 1980, minorities were 9 percent. Twenty years later, they were 40 percent. How is that a &#8220;doubling&#8221;?</p>

		<p>People live happier, learn better, and are simply more comfortable with THEIR OWN KIND.  These stupid diversiculites don&rsquo;t every get the truth - the vast majority of us whites do not socialize with blacks and vice versa.  We do socialize with some Mexicans and Asians.  But this pie in the sky colorblind society that dreamers envisioned in the 1960&rsquo;s has not materialized and never will.  In TV commercials you always see a token black person at the party - but you will rarely if ever see that in real life.</p>

		<p>Yup, I know Pennsauken. Used to be a nice place. It never was a high end town, just a working man&rsquo;s town. Now it&rsquo;s a down and out place and it&rsquo;s either an Abbott (on the dole - funded by the state taxpayers) school district or it soon will be. It&rsquo;s become part of &#8220;Greater&#8221; Camden now. </p>

		<p>For the record, I checked the demographics of Pennsauken Township schools from the US Department of Education.  <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/" rel="nofollow">https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/</a></p>
<p>Overall, the student population as of 2008 was:<br>
1061 whites<br>
2052 blacks<br>
1963 hispanics<br>
492 other</p>
<p>The percentage works out to 19% white for Pennsauken&rsquo;s public schools.  </p>

		<p> Typically opinionated tripe written by a bleeding-heart liberal newspaper reporter from the East Coast. Was there one White person quoted in the story, other than Ms. Cummings, who is 110 percent in favor of the darkening of Pennsauken? If there was, I missed it. The remark by the black studies professor about White flight being caused by &#8220;paranoia&#8221; was laughably wrong-headed.</p>
<p> And there wasn&rsquo;t one ounce of real analysis in this story   &mdash;   only an attempt to convince everyone of how wonderful a &#8220;multicultural community&#8221; could be if we racist old White people would only give it a chance. Ha! Make me laugh!</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s some brilliance on those white devils doing just that:</p>
<p>&#8220;That spiraling down [of resident crackers] is mostly the result of paranoia,&#8221; says Nathaniel Norment Jr., chairman of the African American Studies department at Temple University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s created based on white people&rsquo;s fear of being close to black people,&rdquo; Norment said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this myth we have that blacks&rsquo; moving in will change the social environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  as always, the insulting misuse of a term borrowed from psychotherapy  &mdash;  <i>paranoia</i>  &mdash;  by people who can charitably be called &#8220;sub-genius&#8221;. (This also goes for any use of words ending in &#8220;-phobic&#8221; or &#8220;-ist&#8221; by the Nat Norments of the world.) I would also point out to Nat that &#8220;myths&#8221; are dispelled by data  &mdash;  got any of that, &#8220;Chairman&#8221; Nat? I didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Something I appreciate more and more as time goes by: a keen grasp of the obvious. Sure enough, this guy gets it right:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &#8216;When you see the low property values, you can figure people of color are living there,&rsquo; Dobson [Eric Dobson, a planning consultant who has done work for the township and sits on the school board] said.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Yeah, that&rsquo;s gotta be one high-powered school board there. Hey, all you Pennsauken crackers: how&rsquo;s that &#8220;diversity&#8221; working out for you? And how long is your commute now?</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>

		<p>Are there any real concrete benefits to diversity?  How do you market failed schools, increased crime, falling property values and lower standards of living as something desirable and what kind of people are looking for these kinds of alternatives to homogenous suburbs and their many benefits?  Even liberals,  despite all their professed love for their pet minorities, live in their own segregated areas and send their children to private schools.  I looked up the town thinking it was some kind of rural place in Amish country but it&rsquo;s only about 7 miles from downtown Philadelphia!  I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s still half White.  The people of Pennsauken need to face the reality that their city is dying and barring a miracle, like bringing back segregation, it&rsquo;s finished.</p>

		<p>J Erie said &#8220;If blacks were tested for their willingness to move beyond race they&rsquo;d fail miserably. People need to stop holding whites to a higher standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>But we say, &#8220;If blacks were tested for their willingness maintain racial identity, they would succeed marvelously. We need to start holding whites to the same high standard of white racial identity that we encourage in blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since blacks are Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;moral theme of this country,&#8221; then according to leader of his race, racial consciousness is moral.</p>
<p>Descartes preceded his &#8220;I think, therefore I am&#8221; conclusion with the observing that a demon could not deceive him about the existence of himself if he did not exist. His capacity for being deceived was dependent upon his being in existence. You can&rsquo;t be deceived if you don&rsquo;t exist. You can&rsquo;t be hated and harassed by blacks on account of your whiteness unless you are white.</p>
<p>That which they hate and harass is organic to your white identity. The white child of your white parents is hated and harassed by the black children of black parents. As they hate and harass you, you become more and more self aware and will strive more and more to distinguish yourself from them.</p>
<p>Whites are educated to think correctly about african americans. We are supposed to think of blacks as our equals in all respects; we are supposed to search ourselves for the evil prejudices and racism that lurks within our hearts that makes us not welcome blacks as equals or even not more desirable than own kind; we are supposed to hold ourselves accountable to them for our unearned privileges; we are supposed to want blacks as our preachers, teachers, and presidents, as our bosses and generals; we are supposed demand that blacks move into our neighborhoods and that their black sons will marry our white daughters so that we can have african american mulatto grandbabies. And most importantly, we are supposed to believe that all pathologies of crime, violence, and devolution in the &#8220;black community&#8221; are the fault of us the evil whites, who are never allowed to think or speak of something as vile and hateful as &#8220;the white community&#8221;.</p>
<p>But in order to receive those lessons and believe those lies, the first thing we must be is white and be the opposite of black.</p>
<p>Descartes offers us hope. In order for you to be deceived about race realities, you must be white.  The fact that you require such special education in race matters is because of your whiteness. All efforts of teaching tolerance and changing attitudes and breaking barriers and eradicating bigotry, racism, and extremism all depend upon the existence of whiteness.</p>
<p>As whites are being taught about the evils of whiteness, they are being taught that they are white. Sensitivity and anti racism seminars are splendid endeavors for teaching whites to recognize their whiteness, as long as we direct the outcome of attitudes based on white self interest and not non white tyranny.</p>
<p>When these white-awarians see black behavior that is clearly opposed to them and when they witness the constant  promotions of black self interest that are denied whites who would use the same logic of racial self interest, they can begin to have Decartesian white awakening.</p>
<p>I am white, therefore I am not african american. I will begin to define myself by what I am not, for african american is something to flee and not to embrace, therefore, what am I?</p>
<p>At that point, a white will begin to draw the distinctions between whites and blacks, and conclude that whites build civilizations and then succumb to the fatal modern white flaw of charity to outsiders without negotiated boundaries. This compulsion incapacitates whites from making rational, self interested decisions when dealing with foreign races and tribes, and we give away our own civilization to those who will destroy it and us.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the mass of whites who do the giving away of their nation. The liberal white elites who hold power do the giving while protecting themselves from getting any of the direct consequences.  When they start to suffer, and only then, can we have hope in more Decartesian white-awarians of the sort who can really make a difference for us joining our ranks.</p>
<p>We need to support those whites in the media whom Mark Lloyd will force to step down in the name of Diversity. The first to go will be Glenn Beck, who has the right instincts and knows much more than he&rsquo;s allowed to say. But when he has nothing to lose after losing his job, he&rsquo;ll tell all and can offer us hope as the kind of spokesman who will say what we are not allowed to think, and therefore our natural prejudices may flourish as a new Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>Prejudice is a precious and sustaining life force; cultivate it. Thank you Amren for doing your vital part in this sacred mission.<br>

Once the threshold of blacks within a community exceeds about fourteen percent of the poulation, the mold has been cast for a  decline in social capital, increasing crime and hostility towards whites. The speed by which this breakdown occurs is proportional to the black rate of increase and supporting factors.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I cannot find an example where a community, or school has actually &#8220;improved&#8221; by an influx of blacks. The effects are either neutral, or all downhill resulting in white-flight.</p>
<p>The problem with Pennsauken Township NJ is it&rsquo;s proximity to that city or brotherly love, Killadelphia. Being an inner ring suburb leaves it wide open for all kinds of racial experimentation by facilitators and many whites won&rsquo;t tolerate that for long.</p>

		<p>isn&rsquo;t it high time the BIG SECRET was finally revealed??</p>
<p>blacks do NOT hate us because of slavery, or jim crow, or discrimination.</p>
<p>They hate us BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON US. Stupid whites believe the propaganda, but blacks know the truth, and discuss it among themselves obsessively:</p>
<p>they hate us because they cannot get along without us, and the more we try to help them reach our level, the more they hate themselves for failing - and whites for making them feel inedequate.</p>
<p>they hate us for trying so hard to make society equal - and succeeding, which takes away their excuses for failure.</p>
<p>hence the blabber jabber from this protected and pampered minority about the &#8220;systematic racism still plaguing the US&#8221;:</p>
<p>it must be painful to admit that the have failed to take advantage of every opportunity to reach the American dream.</p>
<p>unfortunately, sweeping away the nonsense about &#8220;systematic racism&#8221; holding blacks back weill not help either: <br>
ironically, it is the last means they have of holding onto some pride.</p>
<p>humiliating blacks by pointing out their mental limitations is not the solution either.</p>
<p>given the polarized situation in the US, there are no adults left on either side to work out a sane solution.</p>

		<p>This whole white flight thing is crazy. First, it is black folks desperately escaping their own brethren who are trying to integrate the white towns. </p>
<p>They have abandoned their own ignorant, trashy relations to go live with whites. </p>
<p>Instead of being an example to their race, they want to dump them and get their kids out of nasty black schools with nasty black teachers.</p>
<p>Rather than invest their time and energy in bettering the black community, they want to get out and leave the festering mass they came from to rot and die.</p>
<p>And black people understand this.  They know that the reason their communities rot is because their own upwardly mobile brethren and sistren shat on them and left.</p>
<p>So why do they get so upset about white people being nice and selling a lovely house at a bargain price to black people?</p>
<p>The reason black people get upset about this is that they came to the white community to get away from their nasty black friends and relations.  Black people know that lower prices mean more black folks can and will move into the neighborhood.  </p>
<p>This is the key:  Black people do not want to live around black people and they KNOW that lower prices will let more black people move in. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the people who buy a vacation home in a nice quality area and then want to stop all further housebuilding. Why?  Once they have their home, they know that each additional home makes the area more crowded and ultimately  will lower their house value.</p>
<p>Black folks are the same way.  Once they have gotten their home in a nice unspoiled white community, they want to keep all those other blacks out so they don&rsquo;t spoil it.</p>
<p>So what is the real problem?  White flight?  Nope. </p>
<p>The problem is Black Flight.  If black folks would just stay in their communities and better them instead of running off like the gutless worms they are and leaving their trashy friends and relations behind there would be no problem. </p>

		<p>Articles like this one always say two things at once, almost as though the writer is sneakily trying to say something between the lines.  Of course, the dichotomy is probably due to liberal writers presenting a set of facts and then stating some PC adage that contradicts them.  Here, multiculturalism is said to be desirable, and then comes the statement that whites unfortunately (and wrongly) think blacks change the social environment.  <br>
After the Civil War, freed slaves began to move into small towns in the East and Midwest, but by the 1880&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, many whites were running them out.  Obviously, some problem manifested that a century hasn&rsquo;t changed.  </p>

		<p>White people leaving can&rsquo;t be the problem, the population of this place seems to be increasing. Unless the folks over in Pennsauken are telling us that there is some inequality between the whites that have removed themselves and the new darker inhabitants that remain?</p>
<p>That would be a disheartening turn of events. Naturally however, because that simply can&rsquo;t be the case (because it offends our precious sensibilities), it must be because of some lingering effect of racism and segregation. Like in South Africa.</p>
<p>When will the white man learn that all the worlds people are equal. Or more appropriately, when will they learn the opposite?</p>

		<p>To poster #13, yes, we will socialize with some latinos and asians.  Some latinos are basically caucasian who come from spanish speaking places.  I was surprised to meet 100% Italians and Englishmen whose families had immigrated to Chile in decades past, also Argentina, etc.  That was so incongruous to what I always thought.  Even many mulatos are part white to one degree or another and have good values.  (The latino gangbangers, however, can move on please).  </p>
<p>As far as Asians, I have known many nice Asian people in my life and have socialized with some and, like everyone else, there are good and bad, but at least they have a modicom of civilization.</p>
<p>I must say, however, and I do not consider myself prejudiced at all, but 90% of the Afroamericans I have met, interacted with or observed have been very uncivilized, loud, uncouth, scary, etc&hellip;  10% have been good, but I would not want to take my chances with 90% bad to see the 10% good.</p>
<p>The other day I was out for a walk at night in my neighborhood.  I live in a very urban area.  The thought struck me that I could walk out at night because my neighborhood had zero blacks in it.  Everyone around here is white, asian and a few other, but no blacks at all.  I marveled over this for a minute.  In a neighborhood that was more black I woud not/could not do that.</p>
<p>I already told my wife and she agreed that if and when blacks ever start moving in, we&rsquo;re outta here.  Already I send my kid to private school because the public schools all over this city are majority black/low class latino.  When I fear leaving my house at night, it&rsquo;s over.  How can we blame any whites anywhere who want to live in safe places?  Just because black neighborhoods are not safe is no excuse to make extra efforts to help blacks escape them.  As the famous article in the Atlantic magazine explains it, crime follows the exodus of blacks wherever they go.</p>

<p>Sadly, I feel that I must contradict you on this point.  Being near whites CAN and DOES help blacks win in the long run, through the process of interbreeding.  Besides being taken care of for all of their natural lives, their descendants will profit and live very well off of the stolen genes that their dark fathers stole from the wombs of white women.  Be it rape or societal coercion, they will profit handsomely from this genetic redistribution of wealth.  Of course, any white man who freely GIVES his genetic inheritance away is equally at fault in the long run &hellip;<br>

<p>&ldquo;We were coming at it from a practical standpoint&hellip; When a town gets below 50 percent white, it makes it very difficult for the town to maintain services,&rdquo; Adams said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this myth we have that blacks&rsquo; moving in will change the social environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed - and virtually every black-majority country proves it. Also, this is why Obama is essentially nationalizing state budgets, forking over hundreds of billions to states with budget troubles. Overburdened California taxpayers can move to another state if the CA gov&rsquo;t gets too greedy. Leaving America, though, is a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>Despite their protestations of racism, blacks flee black countries for white countries and flee black neighborhoods for white neighborhoods. They&rsquo;ll even risk their lives to get away from countries where they are the majority. Shortly after arriving in the new, white country, the protestations of &#8220;racism&#8221; begin.

		<p>The only way for an average African to obtain a high standard of living is to live amongst Europeans or NE Asians.  Africans all over the world realize this.  This is why Africans everywhere (from Africa to Haiti to Detroit) will do anything they can to escape from other Africans and get to a predominately European nation, city, or community.  </p>
<p>They know that if they are forced to live around other Africans, their lives will be miserable.  The thing is, this strategy works for a while.  At first, when Africans make up only 5% of a population, they do quite well.  But as more and more Africans move into an area, and the population becomes predominately African, then wealth, safety, culture and society all plummet, back to the African base-line. </p>

		<p>Do you want to know how to cure the scourge of diversity and unwanted people moving in to your town?  There are seven simple steps:</p>
<p>#1  Make sure your town has no public social benefits whatsoever.  Instead, there can be an unofficial non-public network of &#8220;friends&#8221; who pay an informal tax to a trusted treasurer to give to those in need.  Outsiders cannot join the informal network without permission of a 60% secret ballot.  Would the Somalis stay in Maine if they lost all benefits?  Not a chance.</p>
<p>#2  Keep your town rural in nature with no built up areas where undesirables would hang out.  You can have a small main street, but of the one horse town variety.  No dance clubs, no liquor stores, no bodegas and no large grocery stores or big box stores.  Small neighborhood grocers, little specialty shops, etc.. These are places that gangbangers do not like because there&rsquo;s nothing to do.</p>
<p>#3  Do not tolerate drug addicts in your midst (meth, coke, weed, etc.)  This will bring gangs who will use the addicts to expand the usage among your teens.  People will have to be vigilant and even spy on the teens in the local area.  Any who look like they are going the burnout path need to be reported to law enforcement and - if they don&rsquo;t shape up - harassed out of town.   </p>
<p>#4  Do not allow apartment buildings or attached houses in your zoning laws.  These bring undesirables.  Single family homes with yards as large as possible.  The inner city masses cannot stand open spaces and cannot afford large homes.  Keep schools on a small scale.  No mega schools with pools and 5,000 seat auditoriums.  More unwanted discrimination suits will follow.  No busing in or connections to mass transit.</p>
<p>#5  Have a police presence that is visible and vigilant.  You may pay more in property taxes, but where would you go if you have to abandon your town to the voodoos?  Volunteer police, citizen&rsquo;s watch, etc will all play a role.</p>
<p>#6  Do not speak to reporters or liberal looking outsiders of any kind.  Then you&rsquo;re just inviting attention to your shangri-la and lawsuits by the diversity-minded government.  Look at Westchester, NY or the last two white co-op streets in the Bronx.</p>
<p>#7  Stand your ground.  All neighbors must agree that they will not budge this time.  The zoning laws have got to be tough.  No one will sell to an undesirable.  This must be unspoken and unwritten.  Sell by word of mouth only, not through any realtor.  If someone undesirable does move in, the people need to shun them to make them want to go.  We&rsquo;re running out of safe spaces in Amerika.  We have to draw a line somewhere.</p>

		<p><b>At first, when Africans make up only 5% of a population, they do quite well. But as more and more Africans move into an area, and the population becomes predominately African, then wealth, safety, culture and society all plummet, back to the African base-line. </b></p>
<p>A white who moves from a European country to the United States <i>may</i> increase his income, on average, by 10-30%. In some cases (a white coming from Norway or Switzerland, for example) it may actually go down. </p>
<p>But a black moving from a sub-Saharan African country to <i>any</i> white majority country will increase his income (not excluding welfare) by 10 or 20 or even 100 <i>times</i>.</p>
<p>We act as though the process of moving from Third World Country X to White Country Y is transformative in some way. This is some form of silly modern alchemy, trying to convert lead into gold. The fact is that there is no such process. Most of us have moved at some point in our lives, perhaps from one city to a culturally very different city. And while that move might have changed us in ways we feel are significant, the truth is an observer from the outside wouldn&rsquo;t really think so. The British colonists who settled the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa sure as hell didn&rsquo;t &#8220;go native&#8221; when they settled these lands, and the resultant society looked far more like their home in Britain than they looked like the &#8220;countries&#8221; they displaced.</p>
<p>Countries are the way they are mostly because of the people who live there, and not because of geographical magic.</p>

		<p>Take a look at what Darlene Hannah Collins said:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;if whites want to leave and not live next door to people of color, you should let them do what they want to do.&#8221;<br>
Since when does somebody in the government have to &#8220;let&#8221; me do &#8220;what [I] want to do&#8221;?  All this time I thought I could decide where to live, but according to Ms. Collins, the government will make that decision for me.</p>

		<p>    I remember a while back on c-span I think, there were these white liberals discussing the way kids segregate themselves at lunch in public schools . And of course the liberals were somewhat upset by it all . Suggesting that students be required by rules to sit by someone of another race at lunch . Americans have always moved when and where they wanted, intra-state, inter-state etc and had to answer to no one . I&rsquo;ve got a sick feeling that soon it will not be so easy . Whenever one decides to relocate, there will be forms to fill out, taxes to pay, permission to obtain and one will have to convince a board that your intentions are not based on race . When I was growing up, you would be sternly admonished if you referred to a state line as a border . Today I hear it quite often . It&rsquo;s just too convenient for the liberals . I can just hear them reasoning,&#8221; Now you don&rsquo;t really expect to cross this &#8220;border&#8221; without papers or permission, do you ? You do know that you are breaking the law ? And that we will be forced to put this your files ?&#8221; I&rsquo;ve seen it suggested several times already that people who work in Dougherty County Ga (largely black, while adjacent Lee is largely white) be required to live in Dougherty . I mean these people are serious, that is the way they think .</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;People were asking why I, a black man, wanted more white people living here&hellip;&rdquo; said Adams, 50, a real estate assessor. <br>

<p>Right, but I tend to doubt that the black speaker here has a correct understanding of what he accidently pointed out.  To wit  &mdash;  that it is not merely White tax dollars that keeps the services flowing. Rather, that such necessary modern-day services need to be conceived of, planned, executed and ultimately managed by Whites to be efficient at all. With the exodus of Whites go the indispensable White engineers and managers of said services.  Hence, White tax dollars are just half the story.</p>

		<p>I lived in Pennsauken for 5 years. (1997-2002)After graduating from college it was the only place my wife and I could afford to live. We saved aggressively so we could move out and raise our family in a &#8220;better&#8221; neighborhood. It was disheartening to listen to the older White residents describe how wonderful Pennsauken was before it started to &#8220;change.&#8221;  When my wife and I had our first child we moved soon after&hellip;I&rsquo;ll never forgot how awful I felt as many of my remaining white neighbors pleaded with me to stay. I just couldn&rsquo;t put my children through what I knew was coming. </p>

		<p>Re #28 &hellip;elitist: Your post points out the obvious paradox of blacks wanting whites to run their lives, yet wish to still protest and revenge themselves when they desire.  <br>
 I feel however your comment &#8220;humiliating blacks by pointing out their mental limitations is not the solution either&hellip;&#8221;<br>
is wrongheaded. Pointing out a truth is not humiliation. When, eventually, the 28% of the black population that is dangerously pscyho is in prison, tests point out the truth to all concerned. But that usually bounces off the heads of the prisoners. They could care less.<br>
So, I would say the pain of racism is not deeply felt by those blacks that can -and do- harm white people; you know, the muggers, rapists, and murderers. Perhaps a few &#8220;elite&#8221; blacks need to feel aggrieved to keep their equilibrium; the dangerous blacks, with whom we should be alarmed, aren&rsquo;t concerned that deeply. They simply want to knock us down and take our money, or lives. For every &#8220;Skip&#8221; Gates there are a thousand nameless wilders and muggers.</p>

		<p>This is a no brainer, no problema situation that is easily solvable. Start a new Cabinet level Federal Department of Internal Migration with its own bureaucracy and administrative courts.

&#8220;However, proximity to whites is not working to improve their overall condition. Being near whites can&rsquo;t help them bridge thousands of years of evolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>You are correct, sbuffalonative.   And, this is why when your doorbell rings and you open the door, on your porch is a young black sex-obsessed and unabashedly aggressive male who is there to ask to see your white daughter - and, if you are the typical race whipped, gutless white coward of a Father, who is more terrified of being called a racist than he is of embracing the genocide of his genetic lineage - you&rsquo;ll let this genetic WMD into your house and bite your tongue, as your daughter shows her disrespect for her own white parents and gleefully smooches her &#8216;trendy black boyfriend&rsquo; and feels so happy to be following the anti-white media&rsquo;s message that spells the extinction of people of European descent.  </p>
<p>You see, it is nature&rsquo;s way for all species to try to upgrade their genetics and survival probabilities and blacks have been given the green light by the Cultural Marxists to fish in the White man&rsquo;s pond - which serves their agenda of white genocide, and the #1 reason this works is due to white racial cowardice. </p>
<p>A Lesson to be learned:   Have a talk with your kids about race and genetics, and about that evolutionary totem pole and which direction - up or down - is the best path to seek.</p>
<p>Simple, huh?</p>
