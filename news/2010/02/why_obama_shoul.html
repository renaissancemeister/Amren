<h1><a href="http://www.thegrio.com/opinion/in-defense-of-rev-jesse-jackson.php">Why Obama Should Reconcile With Rev. Jesse Jackson</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dr. Boyce Watkins, The Grio, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Say what you want about Rev. Jesse Jackson, but the value of his legacy cannot be denied. Few have made the sacrifices Jackson has made, and few can match his historical significance when it comes to America&rsquo;s quest for equality and civil rights. Every politician or American citizen who wishes to question the methods by which Jackson achieves his objectives need only compare his record to their own. Most politicians can&rsquo;t say that they nearly died in order to serve their constituencies, but Jesse Jackson can certainly make such a statement.</p>
<p>What is important to understand about the legacy of Rev. Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton and others is that most of what we know about these men has been presented through the lens of an American media construct that is conditioned to project negative imagery of black men. Therefore, when Bill Clinton has an affair, he&rsquo;s just another philandering politician. When Jesse Jackson has an affair, he is considered unfit to lead. When Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Harry Reid say racially insensitive things about Obama, it becomes water under the bridge. When Rev. Jackson slips and makes a televised error, some have the audacity to argue that he is no longer relevant. The decision by some to toss out black leadership in exchange for a black president becomes mind boggling in light of the fact that our black president has made it abundantly clear that he has almost no interest in pursuing targeted advocacy for the African-American community.</p>
<p>I remember getting a call from Rev. Jackson the day after his fateful slip on Fox News during the 2008 presidential campaign. {snip} I immediately forgave him and put his mistake into context. I know that Rev. Jackson&rsquo;s hurtful words toward Barack Obama were no different from the kinds of words being used behind closed doors by political figures every single day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given that several prominent figures on Capitol Hill have been guilty of embarrassing slips of the tongue, why in the world have we allowed President Obama to symbolically castrate and isolate one of the leading black political figures in American history?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The source of the double standard in Obama&rsquo;s ability to forgive is the issue of power. Harry Reid, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and others can disrespect the president, embarrass him and attack him in racially-underhanded ways because President Obama has acknowledged the significance of these individuals. Given that many are advocating for a post-racial America, which we now know to be a silly concept, orchestrating the political death of Rev. Jesse Jackson is the most direct way to pursue that objective.</p>
<p>I am not sure how much President Obama rules with his head versus his heart. I am also not certain how important the African-American agenda coincides with Obama&rsquo;s. {snip} Most significantly, it&rsquo;s about understanding how the president balances his broader political legacy with the legacy of doing what&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If the president wants to do what&rsquo;s right, he will invite Rev. Jesse Jackson to the White House. {snip} President Obama doesn&rsquo;t have to be Jackson&rsquo;s buddy or political ally; he should only give him the respect of an elder statesman who has faithfully served the community that helped get him into the Oval Office. {snip}<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s precisely the excuse that you lefties made for him.  As a matter of fact, once Clinton was impeached, some of these same people called Clinton &#8220;black&#8221; because he was being pursued by &#8220;Da Man&#8221; (some Republicans), and that he cheated on his &#8220;woman.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ah, it seems that Boyce Watkins (or Dr. Boyce, as he incessantly refers to himself) is upset that Obama doesn&rsquo;t do enough for black people. Well, I think we all know what would happen if Obama were to embrace a radical black agenda! If blacks expect Obama and the government to save them, then they are in trouble. Boyce Watkins, love him or hate him, actually preaches black self-improvement and empowerment.</p>
<p>However, his admiration of Jesse Jackson is foolish. Who cares that Jesse Jackson was one of MlK&rsquo;s sidekicks during the Civil Rights Movement? I guess one could say that Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s presidential campaign helped Barack Obama. After all, when Obama ran for office, he did the exact opposite of Jesse Jackson in order to appeal to white voters. </p>
<p>Overall, this nation needs more Farrakhans and fewer whiny integrationists like Jesse Jackson. </p>

<p>Al &#8220;Tawana Brawley&#8221; Sharpton projected his own negative image all by himself, he didn&rsquo;t need the media to do it for him.  This whole article is like me whining that George Bush never invited Jared Taylor to the White House (except that Jared is a far more decent man than Jesse or Al).</p>

		<p>At first I cackled reading the description of the shameless shakedown artist Jesse Jackson as a noble, self-sacrificing hero who risked his life for his people.</p>
<p>Then I became angry recalling that this racist idiot Boyce Watkins has refused to retract his slander of the Duke lacrosse team even after their zany accuser was recently booked on attempted murder charges.<br>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;could it be the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; in front of Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s name that has something to do with it? Don&rsquo;t we have higher standards for preachers than for politicians?</p>
<p>All in all, a whitewash of the race-hustler that is Jesse HIJACKson.</p>

<p>NOT only did the Ambassador get rich, but so did his WHOLE fambly [sic]. The Jackson fambly [sic] done want for nothing. Jesse always travels in the latest and most modern and largest SUV, a fleet of them as a matter of fact, he the Ambassador always having to travel with a large entourage. Just like royalty, and surely fitting for a man with the title of Ambassador.</p>

<p>The man writing this article is an unreasonable fool who deserves to not even have a job as an objective journalist.</p>
<p>Blacks are victims of their own regressive nature.  They are not victims of our Country and whites&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Obama (barry) is the answer for nothing, however, he has done more to empower conservatives than any other person in the past twenty years.  Keep barry doing what he&rsquo;s doing, America just might survive by doing the opposite.</p>

		<p>Dont be tricked with this snake oil sell. JJ loves BO with all his heart and soul and his words were contrived 100%. He knew the mike was on and said this that if listened to was completely out of context with the ceonversation he was having with the other black who looked perplexed and didnt understand what he was saying. <br>
JJ is a snake whose real name is Jesse Robinson since his mother had him out of wedlock  in Greenville SC originally attending an all black college in the north on a baseball scholarship where he left acusing them of racism since he was from the south and sat him on the bench. He then went to A&T; in Greensboro NC where he had no competition at sports and was a starter before hooking up with commie Rev Michael King to cause trouble. </p>
<p>Funny how his out of wedlock daughter in 1999 got little media atention.</p>

		<p>What Jackson said was not a &#8220;slip of the tongue&#8221;.  It was a direct, hateful pronoucement inadvertently caught on audio.  <br>
When Jesse ran for Prez, he was already known as a serial womanizer.  The fact that the (almost entirely) liberal press didn&rsquo;t report it is probably because he&rsquo;s black.</p>

Like the writer of this article, I also encourage Pres. Obama to get closer to Jesse Jackson. And Al Sharpton, too. </p>
<p>I have white Democrat friends who defend their voting for the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; Obama because, they say, Obama represents a shift away from the likes of Jackson and Sharpton   &mdash;   men so divisive and confrontational even deluded Dems can see they&rsquo;re opportunists and race hustlers. I try to tell them that Obama is NOT an alternative to Jackson and Sharpton   &mdash;   merely a softer, slicker, more mediagenic version of them. (They, of course, call me a racist for this.) </p>
<p>If Barry were to start cultivating friendship with these Jackson and Sharpton, it would do a great deal to help us convince Obama&rsquo;s white fans that he too is pushing an anti-white agenda. The more Obama pals around with these pariahs, the better our chances for ousting him come 2012. <br>

		<p>They&rsquo;re both from Chicago.  The Chicago black politicians snubbed Jackson form the day he arrived in town.  That&rsquo;s why he had to go national.  Black Chicagoans, especially the ones in jackson&rsquo;s age group know a lot about his unsavory activities, such as his involvement with the Blackstone Rangers and Devils Disciples criminal organized crime groups, his huge embezzlement from Operation PUSH and his other organizations and numberous other activities.  Many still resent his numerous attempts to take the glory from Harold Washington, Chicago&rsquo;s black Mayor.</p>
<p>Jackson is a total crook in the opinion of Chicago black politicians.  That&rsquo;s why they snubbed him during the years he spent in Chicago trying to build a power base fro himself.  His power base was actually the white media and federal money.</p>
<p>Obama on the other hand is about as clean as a Chicago politician can be.  From the first, Obama and his puppetmasters kept him clean and free from the usual Chicago corruption.</p>
<p>Jackson is old news.  Obama and more importantly his puppetmasters want nothing more to do with him.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m White.  Blacks have told me of one of Jackson&rsquo;s scams.  He won&rsquo;t make an appearance unless he has 3 appearances in the same town on the same day.  He charges for each appearance as is normal.  But then he makes each organization pay the full cost of his trip.  Most speech makers divvy up the cost of travel among the organizations if they host him or her on the same day.</p>
<p>Everything Jackson does is of course horrendously expensive.  he is also known for insisting on overnight stays at the most expensive hotels even though he flies out right after his last speech.</p>
<p>The organizations who host him are never allowed to pay the costs of his travel and hotels directly.  They pay Jackson who then claims to pay the hotels where he never stays.</p>
<p>Blacks are wise to this.</p>
<p>Black politicians and appointed officials joke that Jackson has never had a real job.</p>
<p>They should.  The politicians get themselves elected to congress, state legislatures, city councils, mayors of large and small cities.  Then Jackson, Mr federal grant himself tries to tell them what to do.</p>
<p>Jackson sits on his stolen federal money.  The black politicians have to face the voters every few years if they want to hold office.</p>
