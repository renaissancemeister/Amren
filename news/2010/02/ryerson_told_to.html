			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louise Brown, Toronto Star, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sweeping year-long probe into racism at Ryerson University has found a staggeringly diverse campus where some visible minority students say they feel harassed and excluded, where profs don&rsquo;t always deal with offensive comments made in class and some non-white staff report a &#8220;chill&#8221; that shuts them out of the power loop.</p>
<p>The 107-page report, commissioned by the university after a string of racist incidents in 2008, calls for immediate anti-racism training for senior staff, sharper targets for hiring visible minorities, more courses on diversity and the collection of race-based statistics on staff and students so the university can track whether equity is improving.</p>
<p>While noting most students and staff call the booming downtown campus &#8220;a great place to learn and work,&#8221; the report, to be released Monday, cites a worrying lack of diversity in faculties such as communication and design, a need for more ESL support in programs such as nursing and business, and more black professors across the board.</p>
<p>Ryerson is the latest Ontario university to examine how it approaches its growing diversity; York University, the University of Western Ontario and Queen&rsquo;s University have reviewed aspects of how they approach minority rights and cultural tension in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each and every one of us needs to take responsibility for the university becoming a truly inclusive environment,&#8221; declared the study by the task force of staff, students and community members that was co-chaired by Ryerson professor Grace-Edward Galabuzi and University of Toronto professor Eileen Antone, a member of the Oneida of the Thames First Nation.</p>
<p>Some of the incidents that prompted the appointment of the task force include the burning of an African students&rsquo; club bulletin board and death threats against a student leader for being a &#8220;race traitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report by the Task Force on Racism at Ryerson tells of students who say overt and subtle racism makes it difficult for them to fit in and at times makes the learning environment &#8220;toxic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fostering a racism-free and inclusive environment requires bold leadership, action and vigilance on the part of everyone in the Ryerson community, and there are key gaps the institution needs to address,&#8221; said the report, a copy of which was obtained by the Star.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many minority faculty believe there is a &#8216;chilly climate&rsquo; at Ryerson that includes stereotyping, double standards, isolation, exclusion and condescension. One member put it this way: &#8216;Many of us feel we are in a game that we don&rsquo;t really know the rules of.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>A five-month task force at York University last year also examined ways to diffuse racial and political tensions on that campus.</p>
<p>The Ryerson task force used face-to-face interviews, surveys and forums to uncover a campus where some Muslim students resent having to lift their face-coverings to enter the library, where Jewish students have reported eight incidents of anti-Semitic harassment in 18 months and native students say security guards have mistaken them for homeless trespassers.</p>
<p>Others longed for teachers who look like them, especially aboriginal and black students.</p>
<p>The report calls for a powerful new Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, with a vice-president or vice-provost at the helm, to give teeth to harassment investigations and spearhead new anti-racism curriculum.</p>
<p>The office should also organize a pilot &#8220;Census Day&#8221; where staff and students are asked to fill in questionnaires about their race, language and culture to allow Ryerson to begin tracking the demographics of student achievement and equal employment.</p>
<p>Some of the anecdotes are poignant.</p>
<p>Black students reported problems finding classmates willing to do group work with them, saying they sometimes feel shunned on the basis of stereotypes about not being hard-working or being &#8220;dumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some observant Muslim students complained teachers often use jokes about sex that can make them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>One professor who was teaching students how to modulate their voices for radio told the class to pretend they were having sex and to imagine the voice they heard when they experience &#8220;pleasure.&#8221; Other students joined in and began making &#8220;very weird noises,&#8221; leaving some students very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Among the report&rsquo;s recommendations:</p>
<p>* evaluate managers and department heads in part by how well they have fostered diversity;</p>
<p>* have the Learning and Teaching Office develop guidelines for dealing with unwanted classroom behaviour;</p>
<p>* develop a course on anti-racism, anti-colonialism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, sexism, homophobia and disability that is open to all students and could be considered as mandatory in future;</p>
<p>* have a special faculty-student subcommittee examine the curriculum and recommend the addition of non-Western themes and course offerings;</p>
<p>* set targets for hiring minorities and enforce them;</p>
<p>* assign struggling English-as-a-second-language students to mandatory ESL classes before merely giving them a &#8220;zero&#8221; for their lack of language skills.<br/>

<p>Just in case any AmRen readers from outside of Canada unfamiliar with the colleges in this article   &mdash;   or the newspaper writing about them   &mdash;   might take this article seriously and believe these claims about minorities being discriminated against on Canadian campuses, please allow me to set the record straight on both matters:</p>
<p><br/>
1. The schools: Canadian colleges are every bit as infected with PC   &mdash;   and therefore biased against white heterosexual males   &mdash;   as American colleges. These Muslim and African students complaining about &#8220;racism&#8221; and being made to feel out of place are either grossly exaggerating the problems or imagining them altogether. The idea that there&rsquo;s any sort of &#8220;racial chill&#8221; on these campuses   &mdash;   except of course against traditional Canadians   &mdash;   is preposterous. I either know people who have attended, or have attended myself, every school mentioned in this article, and I can assure you  that absolutely everything that can be done to cater to these &#8220;underdog&#8221; minorities has been done short of actually handing over the keys to them so the immigrants can remake them as Afro-Muslim jihad factories. (And if the liberals have their way, even that is only a few years away&hellip;) </p>
<p>2. The newspaper: Those not aware of the extreme left-wing bias of this, the largest daily paper in Canada, should be aware that it is known locally as &#8220;The Toronto (Red) Star.&#8221; That nickname should tell you everything you need to know. </p>
<p><br/>
Understand these two points and you&rsquo;ll come to the inescapable conclusion that everything in this article is nonsense. EVERYTHING. </p>

		<p>As long as there&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity,&#8221; there will be racism, be it real or perceived, because being a minority is unpleasant.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a minority, would you?  The diversity push to cram all races together in one space creates a bunch of minority groups, all of whom feel the stress of being a minority.  Separate the races into places where they can be their own majorities, and racism will go away.  I would venture to guess that black students at majority black colleges are happier.  Being the majority is much more desirable and healthy.  We must all segregate.</p>

		<p>Surrender has never been this difficult before. Why go to so much trouble just to surrender your own country and culture? Do you really need to &#8220;develop a course on anti-racism, anti-colonialism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, sexism, homophobia and disability that is open to all students and could be considered as mandatory in future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any Canadian who agrees with this nonsense deserves what they will get. What will they get? They will lose their country. It better be very important to them.<br/>

		<p>The only ones who can ever be offensive, are whites. Among a certain educated crowd, the word red-neck, a racial slur, is used in an effort by the speak to prove to everyone else how enlightened the speaker is. The only &#8216;chill&rsquo; taking place on campus is the one designed to keep white student silent and completely &#8216;raceless&rsquo; in a society increasingly race conscious and divided along the lines of a top to bottom racial spoils system. Minority groups are encouraged, and indeed, are the physical, moral and vocal component of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, white groups are considered the embodiment of hatred. </p>
<p>That it is leftists and minorities who make claim they are the ones being &#8216;silenced&rsquo; shows that they are not only more-than happy to discriminate, they actively lie at every opportunity too. </p>

		<p>I would also be offended/embarassed by the sexual comments and can understand how any other religious people might be as well. It is also understandable that other students might not want to work with black students since they have more than likely had other incidents with them before. All I could tell the black students would be to prove the detractors wrong and do the best to their ability. </p>

<p>Great idea.  These have been a smashing success.  Everywhere else they&rsquo;ve been tried they&rsquo;ve resulted in spectacular multiracial harmony and goodwill   &mdash;   diverse peoples just can&rsquo;t get enough of one another. </p>
<p>Now, you might say, very funny, but what solutions do <i>you</i> have?  Well, how about facing reality?  Diversity isn&rsquo;t a strength and students should not be taught that it is.  Students should be taught that they can expect to generally get along best with those who are most similar to themselves (as if they haven&rsquo;t worked it on their own) and that in the meantime, until sturdier social structures to reduce diversity are implemented, diversity is something that needs to be endured.</p>

<p>Did they do away with black colleges! Same old game - con your way into a White college, then complain that they &#8220;don&rsquo;t look like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black students reported problems finding classmates willing to do group work with them, saying they sometimes feel shunned on the basis of stereotypes about not being hard-working or being &ldquo;dumb.�?</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t hard working, you ARE dumb! That&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t do group work with you, they&rsquo;re tired of pulling your weight. They do all the work, and you get the good grade.</p>

		<p>They should rename the school Antonio Gramsci University. &#8220;The long march through the institutions&#8221; was his strategy. Years of quiet building have allowed all the pieces to fall into place and a takeover is now possible. </p>
<p>Maybe one way to stop this process is to make the high level jobs in colleges political. When a conservative government is elected then jobs like college president, deans, and department chairs will be appointed by the government. I don&rsquo;t see how the colleges can object, they surely can&rsquo;t claim that their professions are scientific and objective. They would be the first to concede that knowledge is socially constructed. </p>

		<p>Anonymous #1, I believe you 100% that Canadian institutions, and its society as a whole, are every bit as infested with the PC-parade that plagues its neighbor to the South.  In fact, I predict that if more racial awareness is achieved on the N. American continent, it will happen here first in the USA.  Why?  One word: exposure.  Canada is 2.5% Black.  They see an &#8220;enlightening, trailblazing&#8221; America and follow its lead.  It&rsquo;s the same reason why the Southern United States possesses far more racially aware Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, you name it, than does the North.  It&rsquo;s the same reason I love reminding my Obama-loving White acquaintance from New Hampshire that its easy to trumpet diversity when you come from a State that&rsquo;s 98+ percent White.</p>

<p>Fine. As long as there is another mandatory course that follows. One dealing with bias and defamation against white men in our culture, as witnessed by the very curriculum, every other class they take, and their open discrimination against white males in the other points of their program. </p>

		<p>eventually the Canadians will run out of &#8220;minorities&#8221; to stuff in seats in their ever mediocre schools. so a proposal: pay US blacks and hispanics to move to Canada, receive social benefits, nnd fill seats in colleges otherwise belonging to Canadian whites. The blacks will eventually drop out and can stay in Canada on welfare for the rest of their lives. A win win for the US and for Canadian PC liberals.</p>
