	<p>Black Farmers Take Discrimination Case to Congress, USDA</p>
<p><i>After string of rallies, farmers arrive with corn and seeds bearing message to lawmakers. President acts, now it&rsquo;s Congress&rsquo; turn, says National Black Farmers Association.</i></p>
<p>Washington, D.C. (PRWEB) February 15, 2010  &mdash;  Black farmers have spoken by the thousands and, on Monday, took their message to the nation&rsquo;s capital: Congress should act now to remedy decades of discrimination. At an event outside of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, John W. Boyd, Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association (nbfarally.com), recounted his week-long journey through the South holding rallies and gathering support.</p>
<p>Unveiling 538 ears of corn, Boyd promised to deliver one to each member of Congress this week, along with packets of Forget-Me-Not seeds urging lawmakers to make compensation for discrimination  &mdash;  $1.15 billion  &mdash;  part of the 2010 budget. On Feb. 12, President Obama issued a letter to House Speaker Pelosi adding an amendment to remedy discrimination to his 2010-2011 budget. Now, it&rsquo;s Congress&rsquo; turn to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our long journey to justice should now come to a successful close,&#8221; said Boyd. &#8220;We have endured many hardships, waited many years and traveled many miles. Now it&rsquo;s time for Congress to do its part and fund fairness for black farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boyd logged more than 1,500 miles traveling to a series of rallies, starting on Feb. 6 in Little Rock, AR and including Memphis, TN; Jackson, MS; Montgomery, AL; Columbus, GA; Columbia, SC and Richmond, VA. The rally in Jackson on Feb. 9, drew approximately 1,200 farmers and supporters. You can view photos at http://www.flickr.com/photos/nbfarally and videos at https://www.youtube.com/user/NBFARally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands of farmers who can&rsquo;t be in Washington showed their support by traveling long distances through snow and rain to join our rallies,&#8221; Boyd said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re here to represent them and get the job done.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Signs are encouraging. On Thursday, Feb. 4, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responded this way to a question about the black farmers settlement and President Obama: &#8220;Clearly, it&rsquo;s something important to him. It&rsquo;s been an issue that has been worked on by the federal government now in several different administrations and dating back many years. Obviously, ensuring that justice is done is important in this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times led a chorus of newspaper editorials calling for justice: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/08/opinion/08mon3.html?th&emc;=th. Boyd himself published this piece in The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-w-boyd-jr/justice-is-the-best-stimu_b_449757.html. And elected officials have weighed in with support, including Sen. Jim Webb, Rep. Artur Davis, Rep. Sanford Bishop, Rep. Jim Clyburn, and Rep. Bobby Scott.</p>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s next stop is Congress, where he will deliver an ear of corn and packet of Forget-Me-Not seeds to each member while encouraging them to at long last deliver justice to black farmers. For more information, please visit nbfarally.com.</p>
<p>About National Black Farmers Association:</p>
<p>Founded: 1995 by John Boyd, Jr. of Baskerville, VA</p>
<p>John W. Boyd Jr. is a fourth generation farmer as well as one of America&rsquo;s most effective defenders of civil rights. He has been featured in The Washington Post, &#8220;60 Minutes,&#8221; &#8220;Nightline,&#8221; CNN and as ABC News Tonight&rsquo;s &#8220;Person of the Week.&#8221; He is a past nominee for the NAACP&rsquo;s highest honor, The Springarn Award, and currently ranks as one of Ebony Magazine&rsquo;s most influential African-Americans.</p>
<p>In 1995, Boyd founded the National Black Farmers Association after encountering the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s discriminatory practices first-hand and meeting many more black farmers who shared this experience. Boyd soon led NBFA members in a march on the White House. He went on to meet with President Clinton and to testify before Congress. The plight of black farmers had caught the nation&rsquo;s attention, but Boyd&rsquo;s pursuit of justice continues to this day.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, it MUST be discrimination because the black farmers in African are do SO well, while the blacks here, under White rule, fail.</p>

		<p>They are crying racism but haven&rsquo;t gave one example as other &#8221; black victims&#8221; do.<br>
They raise produce and sell it in a free market like white farmers do and probably take the best price they can get like the white farmer does.<br>
So what&rsquo;s the problem? They don&rsquo;t get the parking space in front of the farmers market?</p>

		<p>Maybe I missed it here, but exactly HOW were they discriminated against?  I see this: &#8220;In 1995, Boyd founded the National Black Farmers Association after encountering the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s discriminatory practices first-hand and meeting many more black farmers who shared this experience.&#8221;  As the Wendy&rsquo;s lady asked(who knew it was ebonics?) &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the beef?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Fairness to black farmers?  What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?  Are black farmers saying that wholesalers and jobbers are refusing to buy their crops?  Don&rsquo;t they have access to modern farm equipment?  Do they have to buy inferior fertilizers?</p>
<p>This has to be one of the more ridiculous claims from blacks yet heard.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting most of the &#8220;farmers&#8221; who will file claims don&rsquo;t even know what a hoe looks like. Well, the hoe spelled h-o-e.</p>

		<p>That there has been  massive discrimination against black farmers is the easiest thing in the world to prove. The white&rsquo;s corn and wheat grow taller and produce a higher yield, their chickens lay better, their fruits and vegetables yield more cash, in fact farming is a massive white conspiracy, there can be no other explanation.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the complaint?  They want 40 acres and a mule?  I don&rsquo;t see that we owe black anyone ANYTHING.  They&rsquo;ve had since 1865 to improve their own situation.  Many have.  Those who haven&rsquo;t, need to quit blaming the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t and quit expecting the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t to provide for them just like their old masters used to do.  It&rsquo;s high time blacks took responsibility for pulling themselves up by their OWN bootstraps instead of whining about racism, victimhood, and entitlement.  Unfortunately, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have made their own personal fortunes spreading the gospel of entitlement and victimhood to blacks, so it&rsquo;s hard for the uneducated blacks to get past it to the truth.</p>

		<p>After reading all of these comments, I can clearly see why white folks do not have a clue.  This law suit is restitution for generations of unfair treatment to Black Farmers. Black Farmers were not allowed loans like White Farmers, or they were given higher interest rates. They were not given fair market value for their crops or livestock.  <br>
I am a white woman, but I have seen first hand that Black Farmers are being cheated out of their family land today.  It happens everyday in the county courts in the South for sure. <br>
White folk turn their backs so they don&rsquo;t see firsthand how badly Black Farmers are treated.<br>
Go down South and keep your eyes open.  That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s really blatent! </p>
