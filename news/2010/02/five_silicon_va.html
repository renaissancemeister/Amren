<h1><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_14382477?nclick_check=1">Five Silicon Valley Companies Fought Release of Employment Data, and Won</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Swift, Mercury News, February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Google, the company that wants to make the world&rsquo;s information accessible, says the race and gender of its work force is a trade secret that cannot be released.</p>
<p>So do Apple, Yahoo, Oracle and Applied Materials. These five companies waged an 18-month Freedom of Information battle with the Mercury News, convincing federal regulators who collect the data that its release would cause &#8220;commercial harm&#8221; by potentially revealing the companies&rsquo; business strategy to competitors. A sixth company, Hewlett-Packard, fought the release and lost.</p>
<p>But many of their industry peers see the issue differently. The Mercury News initially set out to obtain race and gender data on the valley&rsquo;s 15 largest companies, and nine  &mdash;  including Intel, Cisco Systems, eBay, AMD, Sanmina and Sun Microsystems  &mdash;  agreed to allow the U.S. Department of Labor to provide it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s nothing to hide, in our view,&#8221; said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, which contacted the Mercury News to share its employment data after learning of the newspaper&rsquo;s federal FOIA request filed in early 2008. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A bigger issue, they [experts in the area of equal employment law] said, is the social cost of allowing large, influential corporations to hide their race and gender data.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the main ways that we track how society is doing in terms of race relations, in terms of eliminating discrimination, in terms of promoting diversity, is by looking at statistics,&#8221; said Richard Ford, a Stanford University law professor who is an expert in civil rights and anti-discrimination law. &#8220;But if we can&rsquo;t get the data, we can&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a problem or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Labor Department data ultimately obtained by the Mercury News shows that while the collective work force of 10 of the valley&rsquo;s largest companies grew by 16 percent from 1999 to 2005, an already small population of black workers dropped by 16 percent, while the number of Hispanic workers declined by 11 percent. By 2005, only about 2,200 of the 30,000 Silicon Valley-based workers at those 10 companies were black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>In addition, among the roughly 5,900 managers at those companies in 2005, about 300 were either black or Hispanic  &mdash;  a 20 percent dip from five years earlier. Women slipped to 26 percent of managers in 2005, from 28 percent in 2000.</p>

		<p>How will their hiding their race employment data hurt their competitive advantage over the others?  They&rsquo;re are almost entirely Indian (and other Asian) in their workforce;  It&rsquo;s a moot point.  I think the reason they wanted to cover up this data is b/c they didn&rsquo;t want to enrage native born white Americans over their being shut out of CS/IT, and the inevitable end or severe restriction on H-1B visas.</p>

That&rsquo;s roughly 7%. If you take in education black and Hispanic are over represented.<br>

		<p>	We have a serious problem with the bureaucrats in the US and Europe who dismiss black failure in achievement as a social condition: when the reality is, that blacks simple lack the cognitive ability to function well in a complex society; black people are widely considered the most incompetent people on the planet; you can&rsquo;t fix the problem by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>At the end of the day, these companies will fail if they hire based on race and not on talent.  How many hispanics or blacks are companies in China required to hire to achieve racial balance?  Okay, so they don&rsquo;t have blacks or latinos (yet, because that is where the money is going to be in the future) but they do have peasant farmers in the countryside and a few ethnic minorites in the hinterlands.  Any quotas there to achieve social justice?  Nope.</p>
<p>I live in a large urban area where latino workers basically dominate in the construction business at all levels below supervisors.  The shoddy workmanship you will find here in buildings, homes and other places is mind-boggling.  </p>
<p>In a cut throat business environment, if google hired a huge amount of black and latino software engineers - wait a minute - where would they find such people?  Oh, for the interests of social justice they will hire a random bunch of blacks and latinos and TEACH them how to do software programming.  But wouldn&rsquo;t that slow them down?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more cost effective to hire a developer who already knows what he or she is doing, regardless of race?  Oh, that would be racist.  Sorry.</p>

		<p>I would say that if these data were released, it might show the fallacy of the claim that &#8220;all races are equally capable in all areas,&#8221; but we know this is not the lesson that would be drawn from these data. It would simply be used to call for more quotas and more harassment by the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; against these companies. </p>
<p>Besides, any fool could take a glance around the campuses of these corporations to get a pretty good idea of the racial makeup of the workforce. </p>
<p>Or how about looking into the race of the thousands of independent programmers around the country? </p>
<p>But we know that will never happen. Whites program, blacks and Hispanics, if they use desktop computers at all, post to Facebook and YouTube.</p>

		<p>Although I agree that the government has no right to know the sex and ethnic make up of a company&rsquo;s staff (nor dictate the composition of said staff) we all know why the IT companies are hiding the info.  They don&rsquo;t want us to know just how treasonous their hiring policies truly are.<br>

		<p>Considering that Apple, Yahoo, and Google are so successful maybe we should be wondering how few minorities they hire as opposed to how many.</p>

		<p>I sure wish someone would examine the makeup of <br>
govt employees. It appears to me that blacks <br>
are employed in numbers far greater than their <br>
general population percentages. My local Post <br>
Office staff is 100% black and has been for years.<br>
A more arrogant, hostile, incompetent and indifferent <br>
bunch can&rsquo;t be found - except in other govt offices.<br>
And with generous pay and benefits and strong union <br>
and poliitical protection, they&rsquo;re in place forever.<br>

<p>Who cares about blacks or Hispanics in high tech?  They have no impact. The issue in high tech is about Chinese and Indians being brought in to replace whites. </p>
<p>Underpaying foreigners is the only &#8220;business strategy&#8221; secret that could improve the bottom line.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not real sure how I feel about this. On the one hand I&rsquo;m cheered about the diversity  Nazi&rsquo;s getting thwarted at minding someone else&rsquo;s business. On the other hand, it also  hides how many H-1B&rsquo;s are they bringing into the country, and are they performing functions that could just as well be performed by Americans? Perhaps that information is available elsewhere? </p>

		<p>Anyone who has worked in science, math or engineering knows the dearth of blacks and mestizos in these occupations. As I wrote regarding another AmRen posting (about a school in Berkeley, CA),<br>
even the Soviets were practical enough to allow talent searches in the natural sciences and engineering to be less politicized than in the other departments of thought. As to today&rsquo;s PC madness in America and other White-founded nations, I am of two minds: on the one hand, it is suicidal to let technology share the fate of our public schools and other institutions; yet on the other hand, perhaps for that very reason, extending the madness in this way will finally cure enough Whites of their guilt/self-loathing complex, bringing the whole mad edifice tumbling down (accompanied, alas, by a fraction of our infrastructure!). Mathematicians call this method of demonstration &#8220;reductio ad absurdum&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The reason the government is siding with these companies is because they employ mostly Asians.  Had this been a case involving large companies that employ mostly white, heterosexual, European, Christian Americans, there is no way in hell a ruling like this would have been made.  </p>

		<p>Something  here does not compute&hellip; several years ago, NPR RADIO featured a lengthy article with interviews on White Silicon Valley ENGINEERS, who were fired en masse from their computer company&hellip; and REPLACED BY IMMIGRANTS FROM PAKISTAN AND INDIA!</p>
<p>Maybe the reason the companies want to HIDE their employment stats is to keep Americans from finding out just how common this reprehensible practice really is. Immigrants, after all, can and will work for far less than their American counterparts. </p>
