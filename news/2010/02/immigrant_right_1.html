			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann M. Simmons, Los Angeles Times, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Los Angeles-based immigrant rights advocates announced Tuesday that they have filed formal complaints against a Santa Clarita councilman they say deserves to be censured for violating the city&rsquo;s code of ethics and conduct by declaring himself &#8220;a proud racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition has sent letters to state Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging that Councilman Bob Kellar &#8220;breached the public&rsquo;s trust and has acted in an unethical, racist, xenophobic and biased manner by making public comments scapegoating so-called illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group also alleges that Kellar violated at least eight provisions of Santa Clarita&rsquo;s ethics and conduct policy, which requires that municipal leaders be &#8220;independent, impartial and accountable to the people they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint further targets the remaining members of the Santa Clarita City Council, who the immigrant rights&rsquo; advocates charge violated their &#8220;fiduciary duties and responsibilities .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by not speaking out and condemning&#8221; Kellar&rsquo;s statements.</p>
<p>The legal complaint stems from a Jan. 16 anti-illegal-immigration rally in Santa Clarita, where Kellar, a veteran councilman and two-time mayor, spoke. In his comments, Kellar referred to a statement by former President Theodore Roosevelt that the United States has a place for only one flag and only one language.</p>
<p>Kellar, a former LAPD officer, said those remarks caused some people to accuse him of being racist, to which he replied that if believing in America causes people to think he&rsquo;s a racist, &#8220;then I&rsquo;m a proud racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The councilman has said that he stands by his remarks, which he said were personal and have been misconstrued. He insisted that he abhors racism, and he has received zealous support from many Santa Clarita residents.</p>
<p>But the immigrant rights advocates said that Kellar was introduced as a councilman during the anti-illegal immigration rally, and they quoted from a transcript of Kellar&rsquo;s remarks in which he spoke about conducting business at City Hall the day before the gathering.</p>
<p>They also accuse Kellar of being a member of the Santa Clarita Valley Independent Minutemen group  &mdash;  a staunch anti-illegal immigration organization whose members sometimes patrol the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to prevent illicit crossings. Kellar has denied being a member of the group, which helped organize the rally at which he spoke.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When a duly elected leader promotes divisive speech, that is essentially hate speech,&#8221; said Robert Gittelson, another coalition member.</p>
<p>Supporters of Kellar jeered the immigrant rights advocates, chanted the councilman&rsquo;s name and at one point physically tried to prevent the advocates from briefing the press in front of Santa Clarita City Hall before a scheduled council meeting Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man voiced his personal opinion; that is not a violation,&#8221; shouted Randy Thompson, a Santa Clarita resident since 1967. &#8220;Bob Kellar stated that he is against illegals. He supports American laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get of my town right now,&#8221; one woman screamed from her car. &#8220;Who do you think you are? Do you read the papers? Everyone here is behind Bob Kellar.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Kellar should never have described himself as a &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;proud&#8221; or otherwise. As the late Sam Francis wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Racism&rdquo;&hellip;is a term originating on the left, and has been so defined and loaded with meanings the left wants it to have that it cannot now be used by the supporters of white racial consciousness for any constructive purpose. Anyone who uses the term to describe himself or his own views has already allowed himself to be maneuvered onto his opponents&rsquo; ground and has already lost the debate. He may try to define the word differently, but he will need to spend most of his time explaining that he does not mean by it what everyone else means. As a term useful for communicating ideas that the serious supporters of white racial consciousness wish to communicate, the term is useless, and it was intended by those who developed it that it be useless for that purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kellar made the mistake of foolishly using a word that has been booby-trapped by the left. Kellar fell into that trap. Now watch him start to grovel.</p>

		<p>Well, this is a clear example of what libs do - they take statements out of context and blow them up WAY out of proportion.  The guy said IF BELIEVING IN THE USA made him a racist, then he was a proud racist.  Obviously, anybody with any brains at all is going to recognize that believing in the USA doesn&rsquo;t make anyone a racist, so end of story.  But not the liberals.  They have chosen to make a tempest in a teapot here, and destroy a man&rsquo;s career in the process.  People need to lighten up and recognize that a TON of folks disagree with PC and aren&rsquo;t afraid to say so.  That should NOT be a crime.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;When a duly elected leader promotes divisive speech, that is essentially hate speech,&rdquo; said Robert Gittelson, another coalition member.</p>
<p>This weasel neglected to add that it is his opinion, that what Mr Kellar said was hate speech. Dont you just love it when these leftists take it upon themselves to decide for the rest of us what constitutes hate speech? Seems like his kind (the weasel) hide in the wings just waiting to pounce on someone who says something that THEY DECIDE is unacceptable. And then send off letters demanding that SOMEONE ELSE do something about the situation. Gutless.</p>
<p>Well Mr gittleson, I see your and your silly &#8220;coalition&rsquo;s&#8221; actions as the real hate in this story. I just hope there is a law (harassment??) that you fine leftists have broken so Mr Kellar and the other council members can sue the hell out of you. Seems as though you folks are trying to silence Mr Kellar, and reprimand the other council members. Just what part of the First Ammendment do you not understand?? And demanding that other council members take a stand AGAINST THE VIEWS of councilman Kellar?? What makes you people think you have the right to tell others what views and opinions they must find objectionable and speak out against??</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;They also accuse Kellar of being a member of the Santa Clarita Valley Independent Minutemen group&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if that is a criminal offense. The liberal who wrote this article appears to be on the side of this pro ILLEGAL ALIEN group. What a surprise. </p>

		<p>This article is almost too good to be true:</p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;The councilman has said that he stands by his remarks, which he said were personal and have been misconstrued. He insisted that he abhors racism, and he has received zealous support from many Santa Clarita residents;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Response: It is and should be obvious to all clear white racial realists, that Mr. Kellar&rsquo;s only mistake is acknowledging that &ldquo;racism&rdquo; by whites is a plausible concept. He is gaining a backlash backing by what he has done for whites, and he should not fail them in his words. He should denounce, without question or remorse, the favorite &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; gibberish of our Marxist and nonwhite enemies,</p>
<p>2.) &ldquo;The group also alleges that Kellar violated at least eight provisions of Santa Clarita&rsquo;s ethics and conduct policy, which requires that municipal leaders be &lsquo;independent, impartial and accountable to the people they serve;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Response: If that is the case, then all white members of the US House and Senate that have served since 1965 should be open to legal actions by every white man, woman, and child in this country today. After all, does not &ldquo;Santa Clarita&rsquo;s ethics and conduct policy&rdquo; reflect what is allowed in the US Constitution? If so, just imagine what the Bush, Carter,  and Clinton families will have to answer for and pay.</p>
<p>3.) &ldquo;The Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition has sent letters to state Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging that Councilman Bob Kellar &lsquo;breached the public&rsquo;s trust and has acted in an unethical, racist, xenophobic and biased manner by making public comments scapegoating so-called illegal immigrants;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Response: I guess he should have called them the &ldquo;sainted undocumented?&rdquo; You know, those wonderfully &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; and mythical Mexican leprechauns that hand out both rainbows and pots of gold to unworthy Americans, and then tell them to leave the continent they have &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; from them? Oh how gauche of you Mr. Kellar!</p>
<p>4.) &ldquo;&lsquo;When a duly elected leader promotes divisive speech, that is essentially hate speech,&rsquo; said Robert Gittelson, another coalition member;&rdquo; </p>
<p>Response: My personal favorite, thanks so much Comrade Gittelson. Might not your statement better read, &lsquo;when a duly elected leader promotes &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; speech, that is essentially anti-white hate speech?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all,</p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>Mr Kellar may not grovel. Someone, somewhere is going to have to say, enough and more than once. The left is constantly trying to both frame the argument and the terms of the debate. This is an old rhetorical trick to under-cut your foe in a debate. The great triumph of the PC gang is to be the arbitrators of the debate, unencumbered by reason or fair play. Don&rsquo;t play their game, challenge their definitions and assumptions. Play to win.</p>

<p>Really. How about the city council? It&rsquo;s violating U.S. Immigration law. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just breaking U.S law. You would think that slightly outweighs &#8220;ethics&#8221;, standards. We are so lost.</p>

		<p>Sorry, Sir, but I disagree.<br>
&#8220;Racist&#8221; is the ultimate weapon against whites. Most scare it more than being called &#8220;Rapist&#8221; or &#8220;Murder&#8221;. Only if people, who are called racist say &#8220;So what?&#8221; this weapon will lose it&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Here in Germany, the process already started in a similar way. &#8220;Racist&#8221; is not told any more by anybody because it is getting some kind of old. People which was called racist just answered &#8220;oh yeah, that&rsquo;s everything you can say.&#8221; Now newspapers are trying to invent new words to insult right people, till now without any success.</p>
<p>Kellar was doing the right thing. And many could follow. And if Racist loses its threat, maybe the people will be able to think.</p>

		<p>Tim does have a point. We&rsquo;ve seen too many others grovel after an auspicious start with the loaded term &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Of course, I&rsquo;d have to hope that Kellar stands his ground nonetheless.  Since when is it a bad thing to want the Laws of the Land enforced? Who do these brawling idiots think they are to run roughshod over those laws, aided by our own so-called legislative and executive branches of government?  And then there are those insane (and inane) calls for more hate-speech laws.  I still think we&rsquo;re entitled to hate or like whomever we please, even in those European countries that have passed hate speech laws to silence the cries of truth and freedom.</p>

		<p>Califoria is on the verge of bankruptcy and illegal aliens have played a significant role in putting California in this position.   Billions upon billions are being spent on people from another country who entered America illegally.  Mr. Keller is absolutely correct in his opposition to the illegal invasion.   And since when is the Minutemen group a radical organization?  They are trying to do what the feckless federal government refuses to do.<br>
It strikes me as outrageous that illegal aliens are protesting that their &#8220;rights&#8221; are being violated.<br>
Mr. Keller is not a racist, he is a PATRIOT! <br>

<p>I have felt the same for years. EVENTUALLY, there will be a White who will REFUSE to bow down and beg forgivness, for the sin of being pro White. Will it be Mr Kellar? Time will tell. So far he has said and done the right things. But I&rsquo;m sure there will be immense pressure on him to grovel, by those who can do him harm. Politically, financially or whatever. </p>
<p>If Mr Kellar sticks to his guns, this may well be the shot heard round the world. If he does, I would encourage EVERYONE reading this to do all within their power to announce the good news. Announce it on other web sites, letters to the editor, blogs, tell friends, tell acquaintances, co workers,neighbors and anyone else you can think of. I am a firm believer that one seemingly insignificant incident cant open the flood gates and further our cause by leaps and bounds. Much like obama hurt himself tremendously with one little comment. The one where he said the White cop, (who was only doing his job), acted stupidly in arresting the black professor who blew a very minor and innocent incident into a major racial incident.</p>
<p>And how about that lady at the end of the story??</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get of my town right now,&rdquo; one woman screamed from her car. &ldquo;Who do you think you are? Do you read the papers? Everyone here is behind Bob Kellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady, I would send you a dozen roses if I knew who you were. We would be home free if all Whites had your cajones. God bless you. </p>

<p>This is one of finest posts I&rsquo;ve ever seen on AR.  All of the millions of whites now cowering in silence, afraid to speak up, may finally get their courage once the white &#8220;Rosa Parks&#8221; (Kellar?) opens the floodgates and makes it okay to speak up.  And when that happens, watch out!</p>

<p>Skip:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.  I live near Santa Clarita and the residents there are mad as all hell.  As I wrote on a previous post, many residents are refugees from other communities, already driven out once by White-hating, community-destroying Third World parasites  They vow this time they&rsquo;re going to take a stand and fight back, they&rsquo;ve had enough of three decades of unfettered immigration and soaring taxes to cover these ungrateful parasites.  </p>
<p>They well know the consequences of rolling over and acquiescing to the demands of the racists  &mdash;  destroyed schools and neighborhoods, ugly graffiti, rising crime, hostility toward Whites, demands that Whites pay their living expenses, declining property values, feral young males forming violent gangs and hanging out in packs.  </p>
<p>The letters to the editor in my local paper in support of Keller looked like an AmRen thread, only much angrier.  Keller has enormous support from the local community and it looks like they&rsquo;re turning out for him, for themselves really.</p>
<p>I suspect the lefties will pull out all the stops and have will no bounds as to what they&rsquo;ll do to smear and vilify Keller, especially to send a message to any other White politician that might balk at catering to and standing up to non-Whites. </p>
<p>The best part of the article for me?  This:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Supporters of Kellar jeered the immigrant rights advocates, chanted the councilman&rsquo;s name and at one point physically tried to prevent the advocates from briefing the press in front of Santa Clarita City Hall before a scheduled council meeting Tuesday&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Right On!</p>
<p>This is exactly, exactly what the left does to those with whom they disagree  &mdash;  Free Speech is only what I say it is!  I will prevent anyone I don&rsquo;t agree with from speaking even if it means physically preventing him from speaking!  Tom Tancredo has no right to speak!  Jared Taylor has no right to speak!  Phil Rushton has no right to speak! Dave Horowitz has no right to speak!  Their messages are of  &#8216;hate&rsquo; and divisiveness and I get to say what constitutes &#8216;hate.&rsquo; And, If I don&rsquo;t like what you say, I will call my race-based advocates the ADL, ACLU and $PLC to file charges against you!</p>
<p>And, of course, only Whites can be accused of Hate Speech and Hate Crimes! Even the attorney general proclaimed  &#8220;before the Senate Judiciary Committee.. that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law.&#8221;</p>
<p>We Whites in California are the leading edge of what is coming to the rest of the country and we are at a crucial turning point right now  &mdash;  we either fight back or we&rsquo;re finished.  If we don&rsquo;t put a stop to racial intimidation, there will be no place to run for our people.  And with the economy on the verge of collapsing and inflation about to go into hyperdrive, the country is about to become a lot more unstable (which I believe will help our cause).</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>What do you think is going to happen when the welfare payments the parasitic class live on stop coming because California is out of White money to redistribute?</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;ll be at the gun show this weekend in Del Mar.</p>

		<p>If a person were to say &#8220;If Martin Luther King is the new Jesus, you can call me the Anti-Christ.&#8221;, he is in no way claiming to be the Anti-Christ. He is rejecting Martin Luther King, just as Bob Kellar is rejecting Anti-American illegals, immigrants, and leftists. </p>

		<p>This man insists that he hates racism, which I take to be an attempt to deflect criticism.  It didn&rsquo;t work, because these foreigners and traitors want him dead, not apologetic.  He can now either grovel, which won&rsquo;t save him, or stand defiant, which might.  As some posters have pointed out, the real issue is whether or not he can dull the edge of the Reds&rsquo; weapon.  </p>

		<p>The worldview that dominates the West:<br>

<i>In reality, the Zinn-type cartoonish reduction of the world to guilty oppressors and virtuous victims is the dominant idea of modern liberal society. It&rsquo;s what forms our educational curricula, our entertainment (with the biggest grossing movie of all time, Avatar, expressing that precise theme). It&rsquo;s what drives feminism and the diminishment of men. It&rsquo;s what drives Global Warmism. It&rsquo;s what drives the surrender of the white West to Third World immigration and Islam.</i><br>

		<p>No wonder there are populist, grass-roots movements taking place in Western nations!  People are tired of being defined by these knee-jerk terms that usually shut down all discussion!  &#8220;Black&#8221; used to be a derogatory term, used mostly by &#8220;colored&#8221; people to denigrate fellow ethnics for being dark-skinned.  Then the civil rights movement incorporated &#8220;black&#8221; and neutralized its impact.  The same goes for the word &#8220;queer&#8221; among homosexuals.   <br>
Americans who have a public forum and are racists (believe in racial differences) should just admit that&rsquo;s what they are.  Eventually the word will lose its power.  There&rsquo;s no law against hate speech in the U.S.A.!</p>

		<p>The group also alleges that Kellar violated at least eight provisions of Santa Clarita&rsquo;s ethics and conduct policy, which requires that municipal leaders be &ldquo;independent, impartial and accountable to the people they serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since when is he or anybody obligated to SERVE illegal immigrants?!  Did I miss something here?  Wasn&rsquo;t he speaking out about illegal immigration?  He should be able to stand at a podium and scream I HATE illegal immigrants.  Illegal is illegal!  I HATE murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping&hellip;  Guess what?  They are all illegal!  How is ILLEGALLY invading our land any different?  Sooner or later common sense needs to triumph over our worst ememy immaginable, PC.</p>

		<p>These people are liars.  If&hellip;then&hellip; is a conditional statement, perfectly intelligible to any eight year old.  &#8220;IF you don&rsquo;t eat your peas, THEN I will set your hair on fire.&#8221;  <br>
     The only reason to debate with liars is to expose them before others.  The liar already knows that you are right, and hates you for it, so there&rsquo;s no point trying to convince them of anything.  You want to convince onlookers.  That is why Jared Taylor is always willing to debate anyone in a civilized forum and why our opponents want uncivilized arenas, packed with an ignorant mob.  Mr Kellar should keep in mind at all times what his enemies really are, and who his real audience is.  <br>

		<p>Please remember to always write <br>
&#8220;hate&#8221; speech<br>
as there is no such thing in the first place. Nobody can say &#8220;hate&#8221; speech, because who decides what is or isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hateful&#8221;?<br>
Do not allow the Left to rewrite our language with such ludicrous terms, which were invented to prevent any debate.</p>
<p>Instead, just keep asking these idiots, over and over again, wherever you find them:<br>
Why aren&rsquo;t white people allowed to have their own countries any more?</p>

		<p>Being racist does not imply one is not being impartial when he does his duty.</p>
<p> A person can believe that blacks are genetically less prone to intelligence and morality, but also do his job in a completely fair   colorblind manner.<br>

		<p>27 Pat Path is right.  Racists are the only people who can do justice to Blacks, because non-racists are deluded.  Southern segregationists served Blacks far better than do Northern liberals today, because current policies are based on the false premise of racial equality.  Liberals have given Blacks houses they can&rsquo;t afford, schools they can&rsquo;t learn in, and jobs they can&rsquo;t do.  And all of these things, btw, at the expense of working class Whites.  Both races are cheated.  </p>
