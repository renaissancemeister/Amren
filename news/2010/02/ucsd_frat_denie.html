<h1>UCSD Frat Denies Involvement in &#8216;Ghetto-Themed&rsquo; Party</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KGTV (San Diego), February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Administrators at the University of California, San Diego are condemning a weekend ghetto-themed party thrown off-campus by fraternity students to mock Black History Month, but they aren&rsquo;t likely to discipline anyone, it was reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; event urged all participants to wear chains, don cheap clothes and speak very loudly, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Female participants were encouraged to be &#8220;ghetto chicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s insulting, it&rsquo;s derogatory, we&rsquo;re being made fun of, we&rsquo;re being made a mockery of and we&rsquo;re not being taken seriously,&#8221; said UCSD student Elize Diop, who is black.</p>
<p>The invitation read, &#8220;For those of you who are unfamiliar with ghetto chicks  &mdash;  Ghetto chicks usually have gold teeth, start fights and drama, and wear cheap clothes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.,&#8221; the Union-Tribune reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeff Gattas, the UCSD executive director of communications and public affairs, told the Union-Tribune that because the event wasn&rsquo;t sanctioned by the university or run by a student organization, university officials don&rsquo;t have a reason to penalize party hosts.</p>
<p>Campus chancellor Marye Anne Fox learned about the party Tuesday and reacted by e-mailing a statement to the university&rsquo;s student body and staff, according to the newspaper, which reported less than 2 percent of UCSD&rsquo;s undergraduates are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university publicly identified the party planners only as a group of students but in an e-mail obtained by the Union-Tribune from Gary Ratcliff, assistant vice chancellor for student life, the event was linked to Pi Kappa Alpha.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Read The Invitation To The &#8220;Compton Cook Out,&#8221; As Posted On Facebook:</p>
<p> &#8220;February marks a very important month in American society. No, i&rsquo;m not referring to Valentines day or Presidents day. I&rsquo;m talking about Black History month. As a time to celebrate and in hopes of showing respect, the Regents community cordially invites you to its very first Compton Cookout.</p>
<p>For guys: I expect all males to be rockin Jersey&rsquo;s, stuntin&rsquo; up in ya White T (XXXL smallest size acceptable), anything FUBU, Ecko, Rockawear, High/low top Jordans or Dunks, Chains, Jorts, stunner shades, 59 50 hats, Tats, etc.</p>
<p>For girls: For those of you who are unfamiliar with ghetto chicks-Ghetto chicks usually have gold teeth, start fights and drama, and wear cheap clothes  &mdash;  they consider Baby Phat to be high class and expensive couture. They also have short, nappy hair, and usually wear cheap weave, usually in bad colors, such as purple or bright red. They look and act similar to Shenaynay, and speak very loudly, while rolling their neck, and waving their finger in your face. Ghetto chicks have a very limited vocabulary, and attempt to make up for it, by forming new words, such as &#8220;constipulated&#8221;, or simply cursing persistently, or using other types of vulgarities, and making noises, such as &#8220;hmmg!&#8221;, or smacking their lips, and making other angry noises,grunts, and faces. The objective is for all you lovely ladies to look, act, and essentially take on these &#8220;respectable&#8221; qualities throughout the day.</p>

<p>Pi Kappa Alpha Denies Any Involvement With Party:</p>
<p>The UCSD chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity denies any association with the controversial &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; party held by a &#8220;group of [UCSD] students&#8221;, identified by the University. Pi Kappa Alpha (Pike) strongly condemns such actions and prejudices as the fraternity prides itself of representing a diverse cross-section of the UCSD student body.</p>

		<p>We have not heard the end of it. If the authorities don&rsquo;t expel all involved and grovel and apologize and give money to &#8220;Black studies,&#8221; we can expect the usual race-hucksters to suddenly appear and make life miserable at the college.</p>

		<p>If a black frat threw a &#8220;Honkie Hoedown&#8221; to make fun of white stereotypes most white people would probably laugh their arses off.  Why?  Because of an advanced sense of humor?  Or because we whine far less than minorities?  A Honkie Hoedown could include things not normally associated with black parties, like belts, manners and the good sense to leave the weapons at home.<br>

<p>There likely wont be a &#8216;honky hoedown&rsquo; for no one is likely to instruct the students to instigate such a party. &#8216;Honky beatdowns&rsquo; are likely to be occurring in the community however. </p>

As an INDIVIDUAL, all she has to do is not behave in the manner that is being made fun of in her area. Let others with her same skin color be made fun of. She doesn&rsquo;t have to let herself feel that she&rsquo;s being made fun of. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to be part of a group, good or bad. They&rsquo;ll always end up with bad press. It&rsquo;s easier to talk about the negative than the positive. If I am part of a group, I have my own individual story that supports why I agree with other like-minded indiviuals.  </p>

		<p>According to the local news tonight, some state legislators are sticking their noses into this matter, most of them black, of course.  And the PC police are fuming, to put it mildly.  What is going to be THE issue here is, do these students have the right to associate with whomever and speak as they choose, or are those rights no longer in existence?  There is talk of expelling the students involved, but on what basis?  The &#8220;cook out&#8221; was off campus, and the frats were not officially involved.  Because some frat members attended this event, the school heads, the PC police, and other bleeding hearts are wanting the student&rsquo;s heads, and wanting to throw the frats off campus.  Should be interesting.  One thing this does point out  &mdash;  apparently not that many have bought into the white guilt trip that has been stuffed in America&rsquo;s faces all these years.  There is hope!!  </p>

		<p>This is funny as hell.  Apparently some UC SD undergrads aren&rsquo;t taking the vast accomplishments enumerated in black &#8220;history&#8221; month seriously.  Of course, this has become a criminal offense.</p>
<p>I must say I admire the courage of these young people.  I hope they sue the hell out of the school if it takes disciplinary action against them.  The hearings could be a circus in exposing the absurdity of Black History Month. </p>
<p>Actually, the theme of the party was actually a celebration of black current events month.  What&rsquo;s wrong with that, simply exposing the students to black &#8220;culture?&#8221;</p>

<p>This is precious! As Todd noted already, Blacks in general are the LOUDEST group of human beings on earth&hellip;by far! It is an incredible phenomenon to behold really, not unlike a large group of young children who can raise a din that is near deafening!   </p>

		<p>I think that students who have spent any time around almost any blacks realize how revolting they are and how ridiculous all this equality garbage is. The &#8216;white guilt&rsquo; trip trash is apparently falling on deaf ears. I&rsquo;m so glad to know that the white students of this country are as sick of these people and their demands as most tax-payers. </p>

<p>They kinda ruined the effect by being so blatant in their invitation.  Really good satire is so subtle that the target knows it&rsquo;s being insulted but can&rsquo;t quite figure out how&hellip;</p>

		<p>I agree with Paul - very funny, creative, and subversive, but their satire ought to have been a little more subtle.  Whatever happened to freedom of association?  Oh, I forgot, it&rsquo;s part of that pesky Bill of Rights and White man&rsquo;s Constitution - so out of date in our Brave New World.  Sigh.  Decline and fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>About 200 students met with university officials this morning, presenting a six-page list of demands for improved conditions for African-American students.</i></p>
<p>The demands include free tutoring for black students, <b>a temporary &#8220;safe place&#8221; on campus where intimidated black students can go</b>, a task force with additional funding for outreach, and an effort to hire more black faculty.</p>
<p>A safe place for intimidated black kids to go. Poor babies. Sometimes the jokes just write themselves.</p>

<p>Black AMERICANS are the loudest group on earth. I&rsquo;ve been around Blacks form Africa or the Carribbean and they talk softly. However, Blacks from America talk at the top of their lungs, when they laugh, they scream and cackle. When a group of them get together in the breakroom at lunch, you can hear them all the way down the hall, it&rsquo;s deafening.</p>

		<p>The reason the Blacks are so loud is that they wish to be heard.  Notice how when talking one on one with a Black co-worker about a mutual concern, they keep a conversational volume and tone.  But if there is disagreement, they will try to dominate you with noise since they can&rsquo;t beat you with logic.  And among their own, there&rsquo;s very little logic, so making a bigger noise substitutes for reason, each one trying to out shout the other.   </p>
