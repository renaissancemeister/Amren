<h1>Do Women Fear Mixed-Race Children?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Razib Khan, Science Blogs, February 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I have pointed before to dating research which shows a stronger race-bias from women than men, correcting for physical appearance. In other words, if a man found a woman attractive the extra bonus for being of the same race was relatively marginal compared to the inverse. Well, it seems that this strong element of race-consciousness in the fairer sex might manifest in an even more evolutionarily relevant context. Race Bias Tracks Conception Risk Across the Menstrual Cycle:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the paper they&rsquo;re specifically looking at white women and their reactions to white vs. black men. Here&rsquo;s a figure which illustrates the dependence of race bias on menstrual cycle:</p>
<p>The authors {snip} posit among ancient hunter-gatherers intergroup conflict led to a heightened awareness of the Other due to possible danger. And it isn&rsquo;t as if the necessity of this awareness disappeared with the rise of agriculture or even in modern societies. Humans seem to have a strong tendency toward &#8220;groupishness,&#8221; and physical characteristics coded as race were a natural candidate for this sort of reasoning once intercontinental travel made it more common that different physical types would interact regularly (and groupishness is probably not bad by the way, it is one way around the coordination problem, and so may allow for social complexity).</p>

<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t all white mothers want one of those?</p>
<p>Just because Heidi Klum&rsquo;s parents each chose a racially pure mate and made a beautiful baby named Heidi Klum, why should Heidi perpetuate the same self selecting white racialism by keeping her own babies pure and beautiful?  Didn&rsquo;t she take a bold and courageous step forward when she smashed divisive and outdated racial barriers by mating with a black african? Doesn&rsquo;t she promote a better future for all by helping to change the unethical attitudes that keep whites from passionately embracing diversity and helping minorities?<br>

		<p>I pay close attention when I see a white women with her black children, I look her over, and try to imagine what it must be like for a woman to give birth to children who bear no resemblance to her, it seems to be such an alien experience, I wonder if she ever looks at her children and think to herself &#8220;did i really give birth to these&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course they are &ldquo;specifically looking at white women and their reactions to white vs. black men.&rdquo; They would never use any other criteria, such as a control group, &lsquo;specifically looking at black women and their reactions to white vs. black men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;studies&rdquo; are always utterly worthless, for that reason. They are only designed to find &ldquo;racism&rdquo; in the menstrual cycle or a even the invention of  the bicycle, as is needed. It has nothing to do with: science, biology, psychology, or sociology; it only has to do with, justifying the deviant fallacy of multiculturalism and by extension, genocidal miscegenation for white people.</p>

<p>Why not. Isnt this the current obsession with the media, hollywood and other leftist thinkers? The possible miscegenation between White females and black males?</p>

If this study proves accurate, it would appear that women&rsquo;s instinctiveness to reproduce within her own race supercedes  any &#8220;mtv&#8221; induced desire to procreate race mixxed children . </p>

		<p>A cousin of my sister-in-law is a white woman with a half black daughter. The little girl was only about four years old, yet it was quite obvious her hair had been peroxided blonde. The roots were dark.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s looks are now gone, fat, no non-black guy will even talk to her, and neither will any handsome black guy. All she can get are the black losers, and she even has trouble getting one of them. Even her female white friends have abandoned her. I haven&rsquo;t seen her in years because she is not invited to many family functions. If there is a good thing to come out of this story is that the younger girls in the family now know that it&rsquo;s not worth the lifelong hassle of raising a mulatto child alone.</p>

		<p>I have always been of the belief that women are far more racially conscious than men when it comes to marriage. You can see this on this website. The few women that post on this website are almost overwhelmingly anti-miscegenation, yet I would say that at least 25% of the men who post here have no problem with dating or marrying outside their own race. in fact, some boldy proclaim that they prefer non-White women, especially Asian women. </p>
<p>This article should not come as a surprise.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m one of those anti-miscegenation women that Hank mentioned.  </p>
<p>I always knew that I&rsquo;d marry a white man.  A few times I paused and asked myself would I marry outside my race, and the answer came back, &#8220;No way!&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this article indicates that people are naturally &#8220;racist&#8221;  &mdash;  wanting to be with others of their own race.  Something that&rsquo;s hardwired into us.</p>
<p>Seems that liberals want us to ignore our &#8220;programming,&#8221; so to speak&hellip;something they&rsquo;d call &#8220;inhibitions.&#8221;  They encourage mothers to get over their maternal instinct and abort their children (as a mother, I know all about that maternal instinct).  They try to tell us there&rsquo;s no difference between the genders, just the &#8220;plumbing.&#8221;  Then they try to push off the universal equality nonsense  &mdash;  blacks are just like whites but they&rsquo;ve been oppressed, ad nauseum.  They want us to go against the natural order of things.</p>

		<p>Now imagine if we men were to offer protection from the evil word &#8220;racist&#8221; and from the attempts by the Left to humiliate our white women?  Women want stability (at least the ones that we should desire), and in this day and age with the radicals having the run of the roost our women are basically left unprotected by us, and we are lucky to see results this encouraging.</p>

		<p>The current climate in the US is that nobody, not just whites, want to have kids.</p>
<p>Many of the mixed-race new generation and non-white assimilated generation are just as bad as the whites. They want to party it up, live the degenerate lifestyle, and be &#8220;free.&#8221; I know a Dominican couple in their 40s that are childless and I don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re going to have one. They couldn&rsquo;t compete against white nationalists having six or more racially aware kids. We&rsquo;re going through a phase right now where things are so awful that huge numbers of white women and white men are being deluded. Nothing less, nothing more. I used to be one of those white men, but not anymore, thanks to sites like these.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m devoted to having many children and teaching them all to be proud of who they are and to fix the current situation in the West. And come rain or snow, at least some whites will survive into the next generation. </p>
<p>And yes, white men tend to be less aware than women. The number of white men with Asian women or even black women in NYC is staggering. </p>

		<p>Not too long ago - certainly within the past 2 months - I recall reading a poignant article written by a British woman who expressed a feeling of uneasiness about her own half-Indian child. The article was published in the online version of a British newspaper and may even have been linked from this site. It took a great deal of courage for this woman to write what I believe many mothers of mixed-race children secretly feel, i.e. that the child is somehow not totally &#8220;of her.&#8221; Oh well, you lie in the bed you&rsquo;ve made, and regrets won&rsquo;t undo the damage. Tragic, though, for the grandparents. </p>

<p>Their expectations, for what they want in a wife, are too high? For my own young son, I think the problem will be finding and accepting a woman he can settle with and commit too. Others think the problem will be keeping young white men straight. For indeed it could become a problem for society as a whole, and may infringe upon our liberty. It always seems to come down to making white men do most of the work.  </p>

		<p><i>As a woman, it&rsquo;s hard to find a White man today that wants to commit.</i></p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. One is the divorce laws which can completely wreck a man&rsquo;s wealth and take his home and children from him. Let&rsquo;s not forget that 50+% of marriages end in divorce in the USA. Any intelligent White man knows the score on this and does not want to take what amount to unwarranted risks on his future.</p>
<p>Then there is the influence of feminism, which has made many White women treat White men as an enemy. Many White men have gotten the message from their time on feminist dominated universities, or by watching the liberal media, that women think of them as oppressors and serial rapists. </p>
<p>And then you can toss in such things as the Lautenberg Amendment and the increasingly repressive domestic violence laws which deprive the accused of basic rights (such as presumption of innocence). Let us note that these laws are supported by both major political parties.</p>
<p>Marriage is increasingly becoming a trap for too many people. <br>
To change this state of affairs, there would have to be some serious changes in the law   &mdash;   and the culture   &mdash;   before we are going to see a revival of marriage.</p>

<p>Thank the feminist movement for that.  Men, understandably, are afraid of marrying, then being kicked to the curb and having everything taken from them  &mdash;  homes, money, children.  Marriage nowadays is not until death do you part, but until you get bored or you don&rsquo;t get your way.</p>

		<p>Alexandra and #22 Anon have both hit the nail on the head.  The divorce rate in this country spells disaster for white women and men both, as we traditionally thrive in monogamous partnerships   &mdash;   NOT casual pairings.  The first step towards fixing this, in the absence of a religion, is to change the laws.  Let the person who initiates the divorce stand to lose the most   &mdash;   the children, house, and whatever else is needed to support them.  Let she or he who decides to walk out bear the cost of child support!</p>
<p>Thank you also for your comment, #16 Simmons.  I count myself as one of the lucky few white women who have managed to find an intelligent, racially-conscious, morally conservative white man to have children with.  One who isn&rsquo;t afraid to protect me and our future daughters from humiliation at the hands of the Other.  For white women, that protection is absolutely essential if our people are to survive the coming demographic wars.  Please don&rsquo;t let us stand alone   &mdash;   we need you.</p>

		<p>I know brilliant, accomplished, successful, single, never married white men who refuse to be sperm donors because they fear losing control of the eventual fate of their genes. Anybody who uses the donated seed to make a baby could be any color and the baby could also mix with non whites when fertile. </p>

		<p>I am a white woman who chose not to have white children with my white husband originally because I didn&rsquo;t want them growing up in a mulatto/multicultural world where they are second class citizens. Here is what we observed, and what we decided to do about it. </p>
<p>Where we live, children are constantly propagandized that white/European/Anglo/Nordic culture and people are bad. White children are the butt of all sorts of abusive actions and comments. They are systematically stripped of their peoples&rsquo; histories, and have them replaced with a bunch of propaganda made up by college professors and &#8220;non profit&#8221; organizations, groupthink enforced by cadres of high paid lawyers and politicos. </p>
<p>Instead we chose to fight for our people via culture war, rather than breeding. We figured we could accomplish more this way. </p>
<p>For starters, we help other white families raise their kids in an atmosphere of support and pride. We help them teach their children the hugely diverse history of Northern European, Nordic, and Baltic peoples. We make sure they learn their ancient classics, the history of civilization, and also the history of the successful Forest and Tundra peoples (especially hunting peoples). </p>
<p>We do this because the schools are not doing it, and these parents have nowhere to turn. </p>
<p>We also support and will leave the entirety of our sizeable estate to organizations like AmRen  &mdash;  supporting the cultural and mental changes it will take to erase the past fifty years of degeneration of civilization. We help white kids of much promise but small economic means stay in school and go to college/grad school despite the biases against them. Because we chose to put everything into earning, saving, and investing money, we will have far larger resources. (Between us we have three incomes, and that would not be possible if raising kids.)</p>
<p>This way we get to help hundreds of kids get past this weak-link time in history, and they can go on to have far more impact than if we&rsquo;d just bred a few more white kids and struggled to keep roofs over their heads.</p>
<p>We also work with local liberal organizations that help secure first trimester abortions for pregnant black and Latina girls, as well as for white girls pregnant by nonwhite boys. We also teach these girls about contraception and sterilization. We are always surprised by the number of black and Latina girls we meet who are aching to be freed of their mothers&rsquo; slavery in breeding, and want something better for themselves  &mdash;  i.e., to emulate the strengths and accomplishments of white civilization despite the cultural messages trying to keep them underachievers. <br>
