<h1>Report: Hundreds Forced Into Labor, Sex in Ohio</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Leingang, San Francisco Chronicle, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 1,000 American-born children are forced into the sex trade in Ohio every year and about 800 immigrants are sexually exploited and pushed into sweatshop-type jobs, a new report on human trafficking in the state said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s weak laws on human trafficking, its growing demand for cheap labor and its proximity to the Canadian border are key contributors to the illegal activity, according to a report by the Trafficking in Persons Study Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohio is not only a destination place for foreign-born trafficking victims, but it&rsquo;s also a recruitment place,&#8221; said Celia Williamson, an associate professor at the University of Toledo who led the research.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nationwide, between 45,000 and 50,000 people are trafficked into the United States, according to a 2001 report by the U.S. State Department. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, Toronto&rsquo;s airport is an arrival destination for international victims who are trafficked in Canada and transported to other cities, helping make Toledo, about 55 miles southwest of Windsor, Ontario, rank fourth in the U.S. in terms of arrests, investigations and rescue of domestic child-sex victims, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A federal investigation into a child prostitution ring in Harrisburg, Pa., exposed Toledo as a center for the trade in 2005. Nine local girls were sold as sex slaves as part of the ring, and at least 12 of the 31 people charged had ties to Toledo.</p>
<p>Ohio does not have a stand-alone human trafficking law. Instead, it allows prosecutors to attach a human trafficking specification to related crimes that increase prison sentences  &mdash;  just as penalties are more severe if a crime involves a firearm.</p>

		<p>What articles like this do not point out is the fact that there are more slaves in the US today than when slavery was legal.</p>
<p>That is the legacy of multiculturalism and the result of those who say the US should welcome non-white immigration.</p>
<p>Of all the idiocy of liberals, this is the most shameful&hellip;.and its something they should be forced to recognize.</p>
<p>SLAVERY exists in the US because of liberal ideology.  That&rsquo;s REAL racism right there&hellip;..where people of color taste the lash every day&hellip;their families killed if they disobey.</p>
<p>For people who supposedly care about non-whites, liberals are pretty cruel to them.</p>

		<p>The only reason slavery isn&rsquo;t supported today is because modern technology now makes it obsolete. We would still have slavery today otherwise. Morality condemning it today would be revealed as hypocritical if not for the technology. The way corporations and our federal government now suck up to China shows how slavery by way of Communism is really okay to our rulers. Relating to the article above, since technology can&rsquo;t replace prostitutes, it understandable that profit making pimps ignore pop moral protestations.</p>

		<p>Every fifth-column Western politician and bureaucrat responsible for foisting this flood of incompatible non-assimilating third-world parasites upon Western nations must be executed with extreme prejudice.</p>
<p>The primitives they let in the West must be deported or destroyed.  </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a game or the subject of casual conversation anymore.  </p>
<p>This is a fight to the death for the preservation of Western civilization&hellip;</p>

		<p>Another case of spoiled childish liberals not learning typical childhood lessons.  You can&rsquo;t have it both ways!  Preach and preach and preach about how beautiful multi-culturalism is and how diversity is a strength, then weep over issues such as this.  Absolutely mind-boggling.  What a terrible issue this story brings about.  If only there was a way to nip it in the bud?  DUH!  Our liberal psycho friends refuse to weigh pros and cons.  To me they are fully admitting that the sexually exploited and victims of human trafficking are totally worth their demented agenda.  Only a psycho liberal agenda can be PC towards illegal immigrants while at the same time turning a blind eye to the absolute evil it produces. </p>

<p>You can bet that these slaves are being &#8220;recruited&#8221; and used by non-whites for the advantage of other non-whites. This is NOT whitey enslaving dark skinned folks. This is often the other way around. And forced labor or indentured servitude is quite prevalent in the U.S. too. Especially among the Chinese community in the U.S.</p>
<p>Every so often you hear about some &#8220;slave master&#8221; caught trafficing in folks, the &#8220;master&#8221; having about $50,000 in his pockets. And almost without exception, perhaps 100 % of the time, is a dark skinned person responsible.<br>

		<p>Reading the original article, it seems that most of these persons are being forced into prostitution.</p>
<p>And enter from Canada into Ohio by various routes.</p>
<p>From Canada across Lake Erie by boat perhaps? Pleasure cabin cruiser full of Chinese or who knows who?</p>
<p>This is not clear. We normally do think of Canada as being an entry point for illegals, but it seems that the border with the north is a big problem too and has been for some time.</p>
<p>Well, as the comment to the article says: &#8220;this is how it is done in the old country - - we do not want those immigrants to lose their culture!!&#8221;</p>
