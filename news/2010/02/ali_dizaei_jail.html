			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Edwards, London Telegraph, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ali Dizaei, one of Britain&rsquo;s most senior police officers, has been jailed for four years for framing an innocent businessman to settle personal score.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police commander engaged in a &#8220;wholesale abuse of power for personal motives&#8221; after he rowed with website developer Waad Al-Baghdadi, 24.</p>
<p>Dizaei owed the victim £600 for a personal website he had designed for him.</p>
<p>When Mr Al-Baghdadi asked the police chief for payment outside a West London restaurant, Dizaei pursued him down an alley in his car before violently arresting him and telling him &#8220;I am responsible for 5,000 officers. I can   &mdash;    &mdash;   your life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dizaei later claimed that the victim had attacked him with a sharp metal mouthpiece for a &#8216;shisha&rsquo; pipe.</p>
<p>Dizaei faked injuries to back up his claims, and engaged in a campaign to smear Mr Al-Baghdadi by claiming he had been caught using stolen credit cards.</p>
<p>The innocent businessman spent nearly 24 hours in a cell and was the subject of a full police investigation before the case was dropped by prosecution lawyers.</p>
<p>After a month-long trial at Southwark Crown Court the jury took two hours to unanimously convict Dizaei of misconduct in a public office and attempting to pervert the course of justice, following an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p>
<p>Jailing him for four years, Mr Justice Simon said the sentence included a deterrent element &#8220;to send a clear message that police officers of whatever rank are not above the law&#8221;.</p>
<p>The judge told Dizaei: &#8220;You knew how the system worked and you thought you would never be discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is to the credit of the investigators in this case that early on they questioned your account.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have drawn a very clear line between your personal position with regard to Mr al-Baghdadi and your position as a police officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You crossed that line and now stand convicted of these offences.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge said Dizaei had shown a &#8220;grave abuse of public trust&#8221; and his conduct had persisted for some time.</p>
<p>Dizaei will remain a senior police officer until the bureaucratic formal process of throwing him out of the force can be completed.</p>
<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated the original complaint, must pass its files to the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) for a decision.</p>
<p>Dizaei will then be sacked for gross misconduct and could face losing all or part of his pension under further measures aimed at punishing corrupt officers.</p>
<p>Nick Hardwick, who leads the IPCC, branded Dizaei a &#8220;criminal in uniform&#8221; who threatened the reputation of the entire service.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t this kind of police corruption not uncommon in 3rd world countries that types like this Ali Dizaei come from? I wonder how many more &#8220;Ali&rsquo;s&#8221; are in British law enforcement? The victim this time appears to be another 3rd worlder but could have just as easily been a native (white) Englishman. Had it been I wonder if the outcome would have been different; would Dizaei have accused his victim of racism and been exonerated while his victim went off to prison?</p>

<p>As England moves to replace its original inhabitants with Third World immigrants, we can expect to see more of this sort of thing.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder just HOW this person advanced to such a lofty position in the first place?  Why wasn&rsquo;t that interesting question addressed?   Was he the beneficiary of some sort of special treatment&hellip; (&#8216;Affirmative Action&rsquo; as we would call it in the states)?</p>
<p>Also, I note that the matter still has to be passed for a final decision to the Metropolitain Police Commission (where he may have powerful friends, perhaps those who promoted him in the first place).  And meanwhile he still retains his official statue  (and salary?)!  </p>
<p>In my police department, here in the USA, he would be instantly dismissed the moment he was convicted. Automatically.  You can&rsquo;t have a convicted felon still holding a high police title!</p>
<p>In other words, if I understand correctly, it appears that the matter is not yet resolved. It&rsquo;s not over till it&rsquo;s over.  Amazing.</p>

		<p>Honestly, white cops do the same. Sure, I hate diversity, the religion, but c&rsquo;mon. Cops, poiticians, guys with guns, power, influence are sometimes bad. Here&rsquo;s one who was from a Muslim country, or had Arab parents. Whatever. Yawn.</p>

		<p>This isnt a very good article. The Daily Mail tells it all about how  this piece of garbage not only  got away with his extortion rackets for years but by getting his black friends to play the race card each time he also got promotion and awarded big lumps of money in compensation payouts. Now there is talk  that he should be losing his pension. Talk! It shouldnt even  be  under discussion. He should lose everything  -and four years isnt nearly enough time to serve as a deterrent. I can see him out in less than two years and with  all his pension and other payouts coming to him. The corrupt &#8216;Black Police Association&rsquo; also needs investigating for covering his tracks of corruption for all these years.</p>

		<p>Mr. Dizaei is on a very big salary - British police are very well renumerated and the higher ranks even more so.<br>
 The sum of money demanded by the web-site designer would be chump change to Mr. Dizaei.<br>
 This says a lot about his character.</p>

		<p>Oddly, this case might - one might hope - be the high-water mark.</p>
<p>The turn of the tide follows with any luck.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that Iranians are not at all &#8216;black&rsquo; and were automatically counted as &#8216;white&rsquo; in South Africa under the Apartheid regime.</p>
<p>Dizaie is an unscrupulous race histler and has got his deserts at long last. In fact, he&rsquo;ll be out in two years.</p>

		<p>You should see the police force where I live.  Almost all third world now.  Funny thing is, those non-white officers are beating up non-whites as much if not more than than any white officers ever did.  </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve noticed of late, the Sharpton et al crowd now is forced to speak in terms of generic &#8216;police brutality&rsquo; instead of &#8216;racist police.&rsquo;  There was a report in the local paper the other day where some minority (now majority) leaders were lamenting that police brutality was out of control and many minority police officers are involved.  The article quotes those critics as calling it shameful.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, the state police are getting called out yet again for racial profiling.  I do not, for the life of me, do not understand why white police officers don&rsquo;t turn the tables on their critics and just stop frisking and stopping minorities.  Let the chips fall where they may.  </p>

		<p>This tale is being chewed over in left-of-center British blogs, such as this one:</p>
<p>https://www.davidosler.com/2010/02/ali_dizaei_when_bent_coppers_a.html#comments</p>
<p>Kenelm Digby makes the point about money. The sum demanded by the person to whom Dizaei owed money was 1/150th of Dizaei&rsquo;s pre-tax annual income, roughly half a week&rsquo;s wages; the SOB simply felt that he was invincible and above all laws.</p>
<p>I wish Kenelm Digby would post on Harry&rsquo;s Place and Dave&rsquo;s Part, two intelligent British blogs. It would be asking too much to suggest that he post on Socialist Unity!</p>

<p>I personally observed that in my department years ago. It&rsquo;s not even new, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s worse now.  The black officers (allowing for exceptions) were generally the most given to using physical force and brutality (just look at how blacks raise their children!), and were the most indifferent and callous to the wellbeing of their own kind.  They were also the most susceptible to bribes and opportunities for taking personal advantage.  Officers fired for rape or sexual abuse (which rarely hit the news) were, in my memory, ALWAYS black or Hispanic, never white.  And almost always for drug use also.  </p>
<p>The black public, despite all their complaints  about &#8220;racism&#8221;, got better service from white cops than from blacks. That&rsquo;s the simple truth.  Still, blacks seem to tolerate abuse from their own kind better. It&rsquo;s strange.  At least they don&rsquo;t see it as &#8220;racism&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Ali Dizaei  versus Waad Al-Baghdadi. <br>
Two Middle Easterners having a squabble, one trying to cheat the other.  Doing what they do best.  </p>
<p>Ho hum!</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s more to this than meets the eye.  Still, it shouldn&rsquo;t even be the concern of the British police or justice system.   These two ought to be slugging it out BACK HOME, where they belong,  not in Britain. The British shouldn&rsquo;t have to waste time on it. Just another cost of Diversity.<br>

		<p>This man has been riding his luck for years taking full advantage of the UKs suicidal anti-racist legislation to silence anyone who dared to peer too closely into his myriad threats and rackets.An Iranian,who never renounced his nationality,he was somehow allowed to become the head of the &#8220;Black Police Officers Frderation&#8221;,a troublemaking sub-group within the Metropolitan Police.Furthermore he made frequent visits to the motherland to lend support to President Mahmud Amadinejad,where he was greeted as &#8220;General&#8221;Dizaei.Assuming that this man does actually get to serve his well-earned prison sentence Don&rsquo;t be suprised if he starts wearing a funny hat and decides to grow a long beard as he rediscovers his &#8220;faith&#8221;</p>
