			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Mcauliff, New York Daily News, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Charles Rangel&rsquo;s ongoing ethics probe is taking a serious toll  &mdash;  on his campaign war chest.</p>
<p>In the last three months of 2009 alone, Rangel shelled out $574,348 on lawyers, according to his latest federal election filings. That&rsquo;s 84% of his total campaign spending during the same period.</p>
<p>Ever since Rangel ran afoul of several ethical rules last year  &mdash;  from unreported income on a Dominican Republic villa to using office letterhead to raise money  &mdash;  his five teams of lawyers have chewed through campaign cash faster than Rangel can raise it.</p>
<p>During all of 2009, Rangel raised about $1.3 million, but spent more than $1.5 million on lawyers out of the $2.2 million he spent in total.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ended the year with $770,589 in his account  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s off his normal fund-raising pace by about $2 million.</p>
<p>He already has one announced primary challenger: Vincent Morgan, a banker who once headed one of Rangel&rsquo;s reelection campaigns.</p>

		<p>Rangel is a very shady character. As a native New Yorker I am surprised that this &#8216;probe&rsquo;(likely an attempt to conceal as much as possible) has&rsquo;nt hooked this little toad on his own petard.</p>
<p>Somewhat off the subject:<br>
 During the early stages of the Iraq War 2 Rangel made a lot of airtime shooting his mouth off about drafting the children of the rich (read: Whites) because the military is supposedly disproportionately poor, Black, and Hispanic. Of course if this guy did a little research he would realize that Whites are overrepresented in the military and especially in those units that do the most fighting! I grew up with a guy who ended up in special forces and has done multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Years ago, while he was undergoing ranger training, he told me his comrades were almost all white. He explained that the reason special forces are overwhelmingly white is that &#8216;blacks&rsquo;(not the word he used!) can&rsquo;t swim! I&rsquo;m sure low intelligence and high criminality also are marks against admission to elite units, but the inability to cross water obstacles was my friend&rsquo;s explanation. </p>

<p>This was true in Viet-Nam too, it still appears to be true with the SF units I work with here in Afghan now too. Refreshingly, the Italian, Spanish and Slovenian armies have NO blacks in them, if they do, they are not in Afghanistan.</p>

		<p>Rangel (as well as Kennedy, Pelosi, Reid, Frank and Obama himself) are how we know elections in this country are rigged.</p>
<p>Constantly caught stealing from his consituents, he just keeps getting re-elected over and over again.</p>
<p>Those others keep getting caught in various scandels, associated with criminals, communists, even mass murderers&hellip;..yet still keep getting elected.  Kennedy out and out murdered a WOMAN and it took DEATH to get him out of office.</p>
<p>How?  How do people still keep on voting for these people?</p>
<p>The answer is simple.  We don&rsquo;t.  Our elections are rigged.</p>

		<p>This man is a classic bigot, a race baiter, and absolutely corrupt public official.  He has no soul.  He is typical of what our leaders want us subjected too.</p>

		<p>Maybe he can emulate his predecessor Adam Clayton Powell and move to Bimini.  The Compleat Angler was burned down but many new hotels have replace it.  Powell&rsquo;s old watering hole, the End of the World bar is still open.  Hope Rangel likes the taste of conch though.</p>

		<p>So what else is new?  I swear, it&rsquo;s the exact same story every time, just with a different name:  give a black a position of power and s/he will abuse it every single time, with a lot of money that isn&rsquo;t his/hers being funneled directly into her/his pockets.  Rangel the tax expert doesn&rsquo;t like paying taxes; are we really surprised?  I think anyone who is is a fool.  Just one more black dude ripping off the public.</p>
