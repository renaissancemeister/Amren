<h1>Democratic Candidate for Governor: &#8216;Whites Don&rsquo;t Want to Work in Factories&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brad Watson, WFAA-TV (Dallas), February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Farouk Shami, the millionaire hair care products maker who&rsquo;s running, said he doesn&rsquo;t find many white people willing to work, so he says he hires Hispanics and blacks instead.</p>
<p>He made the comments responding to a question about whether the state should crack down on employers hiring illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shami declined at Monday&rsquo;s statewide televised debate to say if he backed a mandate on employers to use the E-Verify government database to check if new hires are in the country legally.</p>
<p>He was asked again during a taping of Inside Texas Politics.</p>
<p>Shami replied, &#8220;I find 80 percent of my employees at the factory are Hispanics. I don&rsquo;t find, you know, many white people really willing to work, you know, unfortunately.&#8221;</p>
<p>While still declining to answer the question, Shami said that at his Houston hair care products factory, Hispanics are vital to his business and the economy.</p>
<p>Asked to explain what he meant about not hiring many whites, he said they want special treatment. &#8220;A majority of the people are going to be Hispanic and African-American. You don&rsquo;t find white people who are willing to work in factories. And our history proves, you know, lots of time when they, you know, the white people come to work in a factory they either want to be supervisors or they want to be, you know, paid more than the average person. And unfortunately they exit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll out today shows democratic candidate Bill White with 50 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters, Shami with 11 percent and undecided at 30 percent.<br/>

<p>Yeah, <i>riiiiight.</i> I doubt that&rsquo;s true. Most likely he is being deceptive and really just wants cheaper labor.</p>
<p>I live in the Houston metropolitan area, so I&rsquo;ll be able to vote in the Texas governor election. After reading this article, I can say with certaintly that this man will not be getting my vote.</p>
<p>What he is saying is an odious lie. I can testify.</p>
<p>I held a temporary job at the post office for a year, which expired about 6 weeks ago. Since then, I have been unemployed. I have sent out countless applications and receieved only 2 job interviews. Unfortunately, neither called back afterwards.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m at the point of desperation where I&rsquo;d take any job. I&rsquo;d even be a garbage man. But I would gladly work in a factory.</p>
<p>I am not alone. Unemployment is serious problem in America right now. Plenty of people are full time job seekers. Illegal aliens are taking jobs from us &mdash; jobs that Americans <i>will</i> do.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You know, paid more than the average person.&#8221;  Yes, I know.  Paid more than the average sweatshop slave labor illegal alien who&rsquo;s keeping his nose to the grindstone to avoid ICE scrutiny, until he figures out how to game the welfare system.  Then bye bye factory.</p>
<p>How dare these white people want decent wages and good working standards.  Affordable family formation?  Sounds like white racism to me.</p>
<p>Note:  The Republicans were asked about E-Verify, and only Kay Bailey Hutchinson voted yes.  I knew Rick Perry was a phony through and through, but Debra Medina, who was starting in on some good positions, shot herself in the foot.  All her good agenda items are moot if/when Texas becomes Mexico, and to say that you&rsquo;re against E-Verify is to say that you countenance employers hiring illegal aliens, b/c E-Verify is by far the best way to extricate employers from the Catch-22 they would face without it, being between the rock of violating Federal law by hiring illegals, and the hard place of violating Federal law by discriminating against Hispanics.</p>

<p>He comes from a homeland where class divisions and exploitation have made his culture unproductive and scarce of opportunities. He has brought these values with him, and is busily trying to shape America into a facsimile of his homeland.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right about one thing. I don&rsquo;t wish to be part of the underclass working for a Third World carpet-bagger. He&rsquo;d have more luck hiring blacks or Hispanics than me. His origins and ethnicity rule him out as someone I&rsquo;d work for.</p>

<p>Yes,I live in Texas and he said that he doesn&rsquo;t hire White people at his business. Of course it is against Texas and US law to discriminate based on race. If a White man running for governor made the same comments, he&rsquo;d be ostracized and forced to leave the governor&rsquo;s race. I&rsquo;m sick of this double standard. Also, he needs to be honest. He hires Hispanics so he can pay them much less and exploit them, not because Whites won&rsquo;t work. Whites won&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t work for the low wages he provides, pay taxes and still feel their families. However, the hispanics he hires for little just get state aid likely so the Whites subsidize his cheap labor.</p>

		<p>I think employers should have to verify legal status, but I do think its true that white people don&rsquo;t want to work in factories.  Our baby boomer parents taught us to scorn such work as beneath us and &#8220;pursue our dreams&#8221; however impractical.</p>
<p>Our generation was taught that we were all special, even though statistically half the population must be below average.  This has got to stop.</p>
<p>It is shocking to me how many white people I know who are totally indifferent to the outsourcing of jobs to China.  They say, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my child to grow up and work in a factory.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guess it depends&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, White men and women who went to college and have diplomas and degrees, like M.D.s, or M.B.A.s, or bachelors degrees, etc, might not be willing to work for a modest salary in Mister shami&rsquo;s factory, doing jobs that require no diploma or degree whatsoever. Especially if they paid high tuition fees, and are still paying for college loans&hellip;</p>
<p>For illegals, who come to the States without any degree or diploma, and who were used to live in exetreme poverty in Mexico, a job at Shami&rsquo;s factory, is like the oppotunity of a lifetime!</p>
<p>As they say, let&rsquo;s not compare apples and oranges!</p>

		<p>Sofita #5, I worked in factories for a dozen years or so.  Usually, I was the only really skilled guy, surrounded by Mexican or El Salvadorean drones doing all the routine work for minimum wage.  I went to a community college and walked into my first factory job with a skill and so I didn&rsquo;t have to start on the bottom at $3.00/hr.  But a White kid out of high school could either choose a dirty factory with no girls and no free food, or McDonald&rsquo;s at the same wage.  Without the illegals, factories would have paid an extra buck to White high school grads to lure them from fast food employment.  From the beginning of their working lives, the incentives draw Whites away from skilled labor.</p>

		<p>Mr.Farouk says White people don&rsquo;t want to work in factories. Well, White people did work in factories here in the US all the time back when wages were good and during this time, the quality of most goods were far better than all the junk coming out of China. However, companies got the bright idea of either outsourcing jobs or insourcing Mexican labor to our factories driving down wages. As such, factory jobs either dried up or the wages became too low for Americans to live decently on. If factories today had good wages as they did in the past, one where Americans could afford to support their families on, there would be no problem getting American factory workers.</p>

		<p>Severe labor scarcities should never be used as an excuse to race-replace NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. Severe labor scarcities are in wonderful things. Severe Labor scarcities are a wonderful opportunity to increase the real wage significantly and rid the society of dirty,dangerous and monotonous jobs. Severe Labor s scarcities are an opportunity to unleash the robotics revolution in the American economy. Robots are here and ready to serve us&hellip;we don&rsquo;t even have to pay them. </p>
<p>It is outrages that a Muslim foreigner has been giving an opportunity to come to OUR AMERICA and advocate an immigration policy that will bring about the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. You can thank Ronald Reagan and other phony conservatives for this. In fact, this Muslim LEGAL IMMIGRANT is waging a vicious race war against the NATIVE BORN WHITE MAJORITY. </p>
<p>Memorize the contents of this post. Use it every time any of you publicly post-1965 immigration policy. Mop the floor up with immigration enthusiasts in debate.  </p>
<p>There are no economic,racial,cultural and ecological reasons for importing even one nonwhite into OUR AMERICA. Do not concede an inch to immigration enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Good survival instinct. No wonder many people state this over and over again that whites[&#8216;some whites&rsquo; will make it accurate actually] aren&rsquo;t willing to work those average jobs. </p>
<p>Suppose you are a non-white who came across ten white people who are unwilling like the person above, what would your perception be ?</p>
<p>For white people, it hasn&rsquo;t been a question of necessity but choice,so their ability to struggle to survive has weakened. I guess that happens in every developed/prosperous society .</p>
<p>Make no mistake, you leave an opportunity someone else will grab it and I mean that in a broader sense not limiting it to the sweatshop job situation.  </p>

<p>What you wrote about Medina is very interesting. Constitutionalists such as Debra Medina, Alex Jones and the Tea Partiers yap all day about constitutional government. What they are pushing is just another version of aracial &#8220;America is a idea nation.&#8221; Some of them may be opposed to illegal immigration&hellip;but here is the catch&hellip;Medina,Alex Jones and Ron Paul are enthusiastic supporters of the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS through LEGAL IMMIGRATION&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually glad that the Tea Party movement was taken over by Republican party operatives. If the Tea Partiers opposed LEGAL IMIGRATION for demographic reasons..Republican party operatives and multiracial enthusiast Sarah Palin wouldn&rsquo;t have gone near the tea party movement. Sarah Palin now refers to her husband Todd as a &#8220;person of color&#8221;.</p>

		<p>  All I have ever wanted was a decent job in a plant to take care of my family and pursue my outdoor endeavors like fishing or just exploring the southern woodlands in the blackbelt where I live . The problem is, there are no jobs . Industrial tracts full of empty buildings .And I for one believe there has also been both overt and covert discrimination against white males down here since the late sixties . I get called paranoid and a Nazi because of my beliefs and suspicions . I am neither, I just know what I see . When I got out of the service in &#8216;73 my girl friend (now my wife)followed me from place to place applying, all to no avail . Including military bases . A good friend of mine wanted to go in the used car business, wanted to borrow a quarter million, the rep on the phone said,&#8221; sir am I right here, you are caucasian ?&#8221; he replied,&#8221; yes I am,&#8221; To which she said, &#8221; Sir, this is off the record, but you can forget it .&#8221; He said he understood and that was the end of it . Can you imagine the lawsuits if a minority had been told that ? There is something bad going on in this country and it is directed at whites . I can&rsquo;t prove it, but I know it&rsquo;s there and has been for decades . But if you have lived your whole life in a 80% plus, white region, it&rsquo;s very hard for you to know it . Largely, our own government conspires against us . The incredible change in demographics that has occurred since 1965 was no accident, It was planned . We are rapidly becoming strangers in our own land .   </p>

		<p>Sadly, far too many residents of Texas today are like Shami - aliens by birth and/or ideology.  Granted, I was born on the east coast (sorry - I had no say in the matter) and love now living away from the leftists I was raised amongst.  When I first moved to Texas almost two decades ago, most of the people I met were Texans:  White, Christian, and patriotic Americans.  Now the majority I see are Chinese, Indian, Arab, Hispanic, or Whites hailing from such socialist meccas as New York, New Jersey, California, or Chicago.  I don&rsquo;t know  how much longer Texas will have even a bare majority of truly American residents.  Time to move to Idaho, perhaps?</p>

		<p>Jupiter,</p>
<p>Medina, Alex Jones and Ron Paul might not be racial leftist, but at this late hour, even being neutral or insouciant on the issue is the functional equivalent of being one.  The only sort of people who will end, as you always put it, the racial, social, cultural and economic dispossession of native born white Americans are those who actually recognize race and act overtly on the matter.  Any person, institution, group, movement, etc. that isn&rsquo;t explicitly RR/WN is by definition against RR/WN, and is therefore by definition an advocate of our dispossession.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t agree with Medina, Jones and Paul on a lot of things, but I also recognize that those ideas are inseparable from the racial, social, cultural, economic and temporal circumstance from which they were formulated.  Not everybody deserves a democratically republican form of governments, Paul Wolfowitz, Natan Sharansky, George W. Bush, George Will, Sean Hannity, Gregory Fossedal, Bill Kristol, James Dobson, et al et al et many many many al.  There is a reason why Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Nigeria and Vietnam are not the founts of Jeffersonian governance.  Other than AR and a few other places, it&rsquo;s taboo to state that reason.<br/>

		<p>The FACT is, most whites (not all, but most) have educated themselves beyond the factory level.  Most whites go to college, or to a post-high school educational setting.  Minorities often don&rsquo;t, and in fact here in SoCA they don&rsquo;t even graduate from high school, so they&rsquo;re better factory material.  In fact, if you look at goals of the various peoples, whites almost always want to better themselves, get ahead, and make more money.  Mexicans are happy to bring home a paycheck and have a family fiesta every weekend.  Blacks want to bring in enough to go buy crystal or crack and some weed, and get high for as long as possible.  Of course there are exceptions in every group.  But really, for blacks and Mexicans, factory work is appropriate and desirable.  </p>

		<p>White people are willing to work in factories. The reason they like to hire illegals is because illegals are less likely to take legal action against employers who exploit the employees. </p>
<p>I personally love blue collar work and find it to be much more satisfactory than desk jobs. One of the biggest problems in American society is people sneering at menial labor and blue collar work. </p>

		<p>Well, I certainly hope there are enough clear-mninded Texans out there to not let anyone like Farouk Shami get elected.  I really don&rsquo;t think when we think about the American Dream, we are thinking about some guy from Ramallah coming here to get a foot into our government.  Oh, and I&rsquo;ll be sure to never buy the products he produces in those non-white only factories, so maybe if others do the same, he can close up shop.</p>

		<p>Texan here, the 10% that support him are probably muslims/blacks/mestizos. </p>
<p>There seem to be a LOT more muslims here than there were a decade or so ago(when 9/11 happened muslims left the area and mosques closed down, locals of all colors made it clear they were no longer welcome), and this is from someone living in Fort Worth, not Dallas or Houston.</p>

<p>Oh, this is very funny. I&rsquo;ll be the first one to admit that Hispanics will usually work harder for less pay than whites, but blacks? Any employer who&rsquo;s been in this country for five minutes knows that not only do they have no work ethic to speak of, they&rsquo;re also a frivolous discrimination lawsuit just waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Something tells me that Mr. Shami is well aware that blacks make terrible employees, doesn&rsquo;t employ many of them and doesn&rsquo;t really mean what he&rsquo;s said about them  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s just throwing them a sop to get them on his hate whitey bandwagon, which he intends to ride all the way to the governors mansion. After he arrives there, he&rsquo;ll have no further use for them, and they&rsquo;ll be unceremoniously thrown to the wolves.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that he has employed lots of hardworking Hispanics.<br/>
But he didn&rsquo;t say much for the blacks that work for him.  It says that 80% of his employees are Hispanic and I would bet the other 20% is half white and half black.  Doesn&rsquo;t say much that Hispanics are more desirable workers than blacks.  <br/>
Blacks are in a tight spot.  They don&rsquo;t work cheap like the Mexicans or smart or hard like the whites.  </p>
<p>What I get out of this is if wages were higher and if employers hired the best workers then there would be very few blacks.</p>
<p>I have worked a job moving packages at night.  The one Hispanic guy there was a very hard worker and showed up.  The other good employees were white.  The other demographic wasn&rsquo;t as reliable   &mdash;   no consistency in either working or just plain showing up.  </p>
<p>While these jobs were more manual labor oriented, they still required mental toughness to stay focused and alert.  Make of that what you will.</p>

		<p>Personally I&rsquo;m glad that more of these third-world carpetbaggers, as the are so aptly described above, come out in the open. I used to think that the anti-whites were at least a bit more clever at reading the signs than that. Happily they&rsquo;re not. Obama is turning out to be a massive miscalculation of the left and now they find out that they&rsquo;ve awoken a white population that would have been lulled further to sleep with McCain.</p>
<p>Now this guy Farouk comes along at a time when the long suppressed white anger is starting to boil over. Why did that video of the 67 year-old beating down a black thug who came after him get over 2,000,000 views in 3 hours? The comments were all overwhelmingly in favor of the guy. Now I sense among those friends and acquaintances who were either casually liberal or just milquetoast about the whole thing a growing nervousness and even some anger.</p>
<p>Also to consider is the attempted takeover of the Tea Party movement by the GOP and its sound rejection. They were forced to take down a website called TeaPartyGOP (I think that was the name) and even Karl Rove of all people is advising them not to align themselves with any party. Orrin Hatch was booed when he appealed to &#8216;moderates&rsquo; and I believe Sarah &#8216;pick a party&rsquo; Palin fell flat abit. Tancredo wrote a scathing criticism of the Mount Vernon Accord. People will just not be roped in any longer.</p>
<p>This is only indirectly related to out-and-out White Nationalism, for now. But Farouk Shami&rsquo;s inept attempt at coalition building among non-whites is a good thing for us and I hope we see more of it. Any grand Frankfurt School scheme that the smarter left was trying to pull off was blown out of the water when the field hands got involved and jumped the gun. The Dems should have put Hillary up against McCain. That was a win-win for them. Now it&rsquo;s going to become impossible for them to control the help. Third-worlders are stupid, unorganizable amoung themselves and don&rsquo;t understand such things as grand strategy. They&rsquo;re tasting what they think is victory and, like with Epic Beard Man, will run into a big surprise. Whatever the outcome momentum is with us and gaining strength. A good thing, indeed.</p>

		<p>Meet the new third World &#8220;Enemy Within&#8221;. This guy will eventually want Sharia law, but not yet. He eventually would want Texas to be a Muslim Country, but not yet. He will cheer Hispanics driving out the Whites, but not yet. He will be all for liquidating Whites, but not yet.</p>
<p>God Help us from horror shows like this one, who plant the flag of Islam in a Free Country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, aren&rsquo;t they be required to hire whites in proportion to the makeup of the general population, rather than that of applicants&#8221;?</p>
<p>Good one. Apparently that only works if it&rsquo;s for the benefit of someone of color. </p>

		<p>NEWS FLASH!&hellip; White Americans ARE willing to work in factories. They just expect and need better pay than illegal immigrants&hellip; something Shami, the Sham, realized and exploited to the max! </p>

		<p>Gunrunner- I understand your point, but it leaves out the important conclusion for the non-Whites. The Browns are overwhelmingly Catholic in Texas (and California, Arizona, Nevada, and N. Mexico) so they also would be disposed of by Arab Muslims. Whites would actually be more valued by this type because of their higher learning skill level. But if we didn&rsquo;t cooperate and convert to Islam, we ultimately would be in for a lot of bloodshedding with the Muslim extremists&hellip; on our own turf nonetheless. </p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&#8221;A majority of the people are going to be Hispanic and African-American. You don&rsquo;t find white people who are willing to work in factories. And our history proves, you know, lots of time when they, you know, the white people come to work in a factory they either want to be supervisors or they want to be, you know, paid more than the average person. And unfortunately they exit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I get it. White people are shiftless, think they&rsquo;re too good to work, and expect handouts. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not permitted to so much as IMPLY such a thing concerning &#8220;people of color.&#8221; But white people? Any slander is perfectly acceptable concerning them. </p>
