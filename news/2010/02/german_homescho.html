			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerald Warner, London Telegraph, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The case of the homeschooling couple from Germany who were granted political asylum in the United States, about which Ed West blogged recently, becomes even more interesting if one reads the remarks of the man who granted the Romeikes asylum, Immigration Judge Lawrence O. Burman, of Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Burman said: &#8220;We can&rsquo;t expect every country to follow our constitution. The world might be a better place if it did. However, the rights being violated here are basic human rights that no country has a right to violate.&#8221; He observed: &#8220;Homeschoolers are a particular social group that the German government is trying to suppress. This family has a well-founded fear of persecution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. therefore, they are eligible for asylum.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
<p>Those last remarks might have been uttered in 1933. Do we truly realise the significance of what has happened? Do we understand that, as citizens of the European Union, we now belong to a totalitarian state from which fleeing citizens are being granted political asylum in the United States? Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, tyranny is back in business in Germany.</p>
<p>Judge Burman added that the scariest thing about this case was the motivation of the German government. He said that, rather than being concerned with the welfare of the children, it was trying to stamp out parallel societies. Making his court order, the judge voiced concern that, although Germany was a democratic country and an ally, the policy of persecuting homeschoolers was &#8220;repellent to everything we believe as Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>That offers a useful insight into how Americans, living in a free country, view the creeping totalitarianism that has engulfed Europe. For this is not just a German issue: we are all helots under state control. Why did the German homeschoolers not seek political asylum in Britain? Because our rulers subscribe to the same tyrannical statist philosophy, is the answer. Every possible obstacle is put in the way of homeschooling parents in Britain.</p>
<p>The mentality is that the state  &mdash;  not parents  &mdash;  is the natural controller and shaper of children&rsquo;s lives and beliefs. When a schoolgirl can be given an abortion without her parents&rsquo; knowledge, we know that, while public utilities may have been privatised, children have been nationalised. The Romeikes who fled from Germany objected to their children being forced to follow a curriculum that they believed was anti-Christian. The same would apply in British state schools, where pornographic sex education is increasingly being made compulsory.</p>
<p>Is that a new idea? Not at all. It was first implemented as government policy in 1919, during the short-lived communist dictatorship of Bela Kun in Hungary, when Georg Lukacs, as deputy commissar for &#8220;culture&#8221;, enforced his system of Cultural Terrorism, force-feeding children pornographic sex education, teaching them to laugh at their parents and at monogamy and to reject the family and religion. Lukacs was a founder of the Frankfurt School of Marxism, later popularised by Herbert Marcuse, whose demented notions are today called Political Correctness and, as such, have colonised Western governments.</p>
<p>It takes the forthright remarks of an American judge, in a country where the culture war has not yet been lost, to bring home to us in Europe that we already inhabit the Gulag. The Berlin Wall did not &#8220;fall&#8221;  &mdash;  it was just moved further west.<br>

		<p>Somebody correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I have read the German anti-homeschooling laws in question were implemented under the regime of the GNSWP, and are, along with animal welfare laws, one of the very few holdovers in current law from that &#8220;era,&#8221; and in spite of its military defeat at the hands of the world&rsquo;s three biggest empires of the time.</p>

<p>I believe that is correct, but the Germans had long had a rigorous mandatory and nationalized school system   &mdash;   dating back to the time of Prussia.  A law permitting punitive measures against those who &#8220;opted out&#8221; was not such a great leap from that starting point.  Its retention after WWII only shows that both the nationalist Right and the statist Left have more in common than they might want to admit.</p>

<p>The author is dreaming if he thinks the culture war has not been lost in America. A &#8216;silent majority&rsquo; still exists in the USA but they are so far lost, and so silent and confused, even they do not know right from wrong half the time. What we have is the illusion of dissent, even a character as mainstream as Jared Taylor is hidden from view and blocked from discourse. It&rsquo;s popular on AmRen to say that views such as Jared Taylor&rsquo;s predominated in the USA 50 years ago or (I would disagree with that) but certainly they did rear their heads from time to time, and many of the beliefs from long ago have been completely subverted. In almost every case that which was considered wholesome and good is now thought of as bad and shady. The average American today would be so alien in outlook to a citizen of 80 years ago as to be source of bewilderment. </p>

		<p>Of all the qualities praised in western culture, Freedom of mind is likely the essence. Our hero&rsquo;s are people that could not betray their conscience even with the worst of consequenses. Giving refuge to people like the Romeikes is the proper use of US refugee laws, unlike so many other instances lately. Refreshing*</p>

		<p>Two considerations:</p>
<p>1) Anonymous 9:46 writes: &#8220;The author is dreaming if he thinks the culture war has not been lost in America.&#8221; He is correct. I never understood why Americans view their own country as more democratic and free than other countries. They are losing their freedom as much as any other Western country.</p>
<p>2) I also never understood how people, self-professed liberals and believers in democracy, not cringe instinctively at the idea itself of state education. How can it be anything but Orwellian indoctrination. And yet it is considered normal in modern societies. Mind-boggling.</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 9:46pm I think it is beyond argument that views like Jared Taylor&rsquo;s were held by the vast majority of the American public 50 years ago and still a sizable majority far later than that.</p>
<p>I would cite the Gallup poll from 1958 showing only 4 percent of Americans approved of marriages between whites and non-whites. Gallup also states that as recently as 1994 less than half of American&rsquo;s approved of such marriages.</p>
<p>The fact anyone doesn&rsquo;t understand this shows just how effective the cultural Marxists have been in breaking the chains that bind us to America&rsquo;s ancestral culture.</p>
<p>A belief that was held by 96% of the American public 52 years ago get&rsquo;s one characterized as a hater and member of the Nazi party today.</p>

<p>I would be inclined to agree with your statement.  Yet, tacitly, the views were there.  America, 50 years ago, was truly a White society and culture.  Generally, White Americans tended to trust their government (a huge mistake).  The government then betrayed these same White Americans with such abominations as the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965.  There were many reasons for the betrayal, but a negative change did occur in the governmental philosophy for the support and care of European Americans/Europeans.  Let these Germans get a true dose and smell of greater multicultural American and home schooling will become a minor issue.  When Desmar beats Hansel senseless in the Wal-Mart parking lot or when FoMikaDinette slaps Gretel in a Wal-Mart checkout line, the Romeikes will be crying, &ldquo;Gott in Himmel&rdquo;, why did we come here?     <br>

		<p>The author takes a rosy view of American society and culture if he believes we are so much freer than our European cousins, but he is right that homeschooling is a protected right in the United States. Even California has been soundly rebuffed in its attempts to criminalize homeschooling&hellip;so far. But the restrictions grow ever more cumbersome and the noose gets tighter every year.</p>
<p>We homeschooling families, particularly the Christians among us, know that it is only a matter of time before we are just as persecuted and prosecuted as the Romeikes have been in Germany. Right-thinking Americans would do well to take refuge in states that have a large traditional, conservative base and a powerful gun culture. Those states will likely be the last strongholds of homeschooling and other basic human freedoms in this country.</p>

		<p>Something hugely important has been missed here:</p>
<p>One of the things that Germany and other European countries has done right is to force Muslims and other immigrants to send their children to public school (often against huge resistance) instead of isolating them in ghettos where all they learned is Jihad 101. </p>
<p>If there is any hope at all of maintaining European civilization in Europe, we can&rsquo;t allow immigrant children to split off from the mainstream this way.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t fair to ethnic Europeans, but how can you have a double standard?</p>

		<p>The entire public school system was started in the West at the time of the industrial revolution with only one objective in mind.</p>
<p>The need to produce the 1000&rsquo;s of literate clerks and mechanics to fuel that revolution. Apart from the three R&rsquo;s, the only things ever taught were the infallibility of the state, the glory of their history, the rightness of the social order and the privilege enjoyed by those belonging to that order. Almost forgot, God save the Prince, King, Queen, Emperor or enlightened ruler who spent every waking minute of his life in worrying about the welfare of his subjects.</p>
<p>Any deviation form this curriculum, even in today&rsquo;s system, is considered heresy and punished accordingly. Let all who disagree with me walk into the nearest classroom and say that America has degenerated into a kleptocratic plutocracy whose only hold on power is their ability to pander to the unthinking mob of the underclasses by blackmailing the minority of productive citizens.<br>
Walk in, say that and see how long it takes for the full force of the law to come down on you like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p>Right! The English are part of the EU and must cleave to all pronouncements and policies of the EU &#8220;rulers&#8221;. Any nation-state wishing admission to the EU must submit to a list of demands from the EU &#8220;rulers&#8221; or admission will not be granted. And if the EU &#8220;rulers&#8221; say that Lithuania must now accept a certain number of refugess from far-flung parts of the world, the Lithuanians must do so. A federal system as envisioned by the U.S. Constitution is not in play within the EU. And is disappearing in the U.S. too. And as always, the promise of MONEY is held out as an incentive for cooperation and &#8220;giving in&#8221;!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad more people are being cognizant of the fact that the European Union is as repressive as the old Soviet Union-Warsaw Pact bloc. When the EU forced the euro currency down the throats of its member states, when it forced them to abolish the death penalty and when it forced them to admit Third World drek, I knew it was bad news.</p>
<p>More than ever, now is the time for the United States to quit NATO, since the main reason for NATO&rsquo;s existence - the Soviet threat - has gone the way of the 8-track player. It&rsquo;s long past time that Europe take on its own defense capabilities. The U.S. should unilaterally quit NATO and deploy its troops to protect the southern border.</p>

		<p>I try to see the positive in every situation. Mr. Warner can still write and publish critiques of the EU, critiques which will likely be read and passed around by like-minded conservatives. It isn&rsquo;t completely totalitarian if freedom of speech still exists to some extent. The best that dissidents like the American Renaissance crowd can do is to stay informed and likewise inform and educate as many people as possible. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Why do these news items only come to us from the Telegraph or the Daily Mail?  Always!  Do none of the other papers in Britain report such news?  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I can&rsquo;t help but notice that, normally, while these two papers may report news pertaining to the right (such as the BNP), or at least the unorthodox point of view, they usually (after telling us the story) then end up sneering and scoffing at it as ridiculous and beneath mention except merely as a bizarre news curiosity.  The implication is:  &#8220;Of course we don&rsquo;t agree with this nonsense, but we thought you&rsquo;d want to know anyway.&#8221;   Thus, they distance themselves from the right and cultivate their creds with the leftist establishment that&rsquo;s in power. That&rsquo;s how little courage they have. I find that contemptible.  </p>
<p>But in a case like specifically this one, they can afford to be supportive and sympathetic ONLY when they are able to quote a US authority WHO HAS ALREADY SAID THIS, and said it officially, thus making it now safe to say.  Doubly contemptible!</p>

If that is so, then it is because those three powers found it convenient and to their interest to leave that legislation in place.  Certainly, as unconditional occupying powers, with unlimited authority,  they had it fully within their means to remove those laws if they had wished, just as they removed much other legislation.  Evidently, they did NOT wish!</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Why would you disagree with that?  Can you explain? Were you there then?   I was!   It was the perfectly normal, unquestioned point of view held by most ordinary people across the land. Today&rsquo;s fashionable, politically correct views, considered very orthodox now,  would have been regarded as absurdly radical by down-to-earth, common sense people.</p>
<p>Since then, thanks to the media and academia,  we have been scolded and told incessantly, &#8220;That&rsquo;s not the American way!&#8221;    </p>
<p>Oh, on the contrary, it WAS the American way! It was the American way, and it served us well, for over two hundred years, until some people decided to change us and our culture. </p>
<p>I fully agree with Anglo-Protestant, who, I suspect was there too.  He&rsquo;s right on the mark in saying: &#8220;The fact that anyone doesn&rsquo;t understand this shows just how effective the cultural Marxists have been in breaking the chains that bind us to America&rsquo;s ancestral culture.  A belief that was held by 96% of the public 52 years ago, get&rsquo;s one characterized as a hater and a Nazi today.&#8221;  I couldn&rsquo;t say it better!</p>

How can they &#8220;split off from the mainstream&#8221; if they never were part of the mainstream?  Nor should they be! That&rsquo;s not to our interest to incorporate them among us.  </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not to our interest to have them living among us as an alien body either.  The obvious answer, then, is not to have them living among us at all.</p>
