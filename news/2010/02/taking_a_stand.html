<h1><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fred-redmond/taking-a-stand-against-ha_b_444955.html">Taking a Stand Against Hate: Hotels Bar American Renaissance</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fred Redmond, Huffington Post, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Washington, D.C. area hotel last week closed its doors to a racist convention that had booked rooms under the benign-sounding name &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; conference. Now all American hotels and conference centers should follow that lead, because in the U.S. renaissance means overcoming bigotry.</p>
<p>American Renaissance conducts a biannual conference that promotes racial and religious hatred. This year one of its guest speakers at the February conference is to be Nick Griffin, a convicted criminal who heads the British National Party, a white separatist group that contends immigrants are causing the &#8220;genocide&#8221; of &#8220;indigenous&#8221; white Britons.</p>
<p>The hotel canceled the booking after several groups asked it not to serve as host to a hate hoedown. Those groups will monitor the organization&rsquo;s attempts to secure another meeting place. They include the United Steelworkers; One People&rsquo;s Project, which describes itself as a resource for those fighting fascism; and the Mormon Worker, a newspaper based in Provo, Utah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It specifies: &#8220;Gentlemen will wear jackets and ties to all conference events.&#8221; Apparently women are not invited.</p>
<p>It also tacitly acknowledges the offensiveness of its message by offering attendees tags bearing false names, which it describes as &#8220;war names&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will prepare name tags in advance; please call us if you would like to use a nom de guerre.&#8221;</p>
<p>That link to violence is not accidental. By inviting Nick Griffin, the group embraced a criminal whose organization is connected to numerous violent  &mdash;  even deadly  &mdash;  acts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hotels and conference centers have every right to shun the likes of Griffin and American Renaissance. Refusing to provide a forum for hate is not a denial of First Amendment free speech rights. Griffin and the American Renaissance are free to spew their race- and religion-based venom in any public park or on any private property owned by a like-minded bigot.</p>

		<p>And we wonder why the American steel industry is falling behind Japan and a few others.  In Japan, the steel industry is concerned solely with manufacturing steel.  In the United States, the steel industry is concerned solely with giving affirmative action clowns a sinecure, as a reward for their ability to Ctrl+T Shift-Ins.</p>

<p>The standard rationale of the radical left for silencing any who disagree with them.  Contrary opinions aren&rsquo;t opinions at all, they&rsquo;re simply &#8220;hate.&#8221;  And of <i>course</i> the law doesn&rsquo;t protect &#8220;haters,&#8221; does it?</p>
<p>I wonder how the self-righteous Fred Redmond would react to the news that a group of skinheads had intimidated a hotel into cancelling an NAACP meeting.  </p>

<p>Wow! Talk about demonizing! So Nick Griffin is no longer an elected political official of Great Britain, but is now a &#8220;criminal?&#8221; Why isn&rsquo;t he in jail? </p>
<p>Does this also mean that Great Britain is now a rogue state? Obviously no respect for the political process.</p>
<p>But what do you expect from a guy who thinks that because a dress code is specified for men it means that women are not invited?</p>

&#8220;Violent acts&#8221;? &#8220;Deadly (acts)&#8221;? And such acts have been &#8220;numerous&#8221;? What on earth is this fool talking about? The BNP is involved in no such activities, nor do they encourage them in others. </p>
<p>Mr. Griffin, if you&rsquo;re reading, you may have a defamation suit against this &#8220;Steelworker&#8221; (who doesn&rsquo;t look to me like he&rsquo;s ever spent much time working with steel). </p>

		<p>This is truly amazing.  Reading this incredible article, full of its exaggerations and distortions, and seeing who wrote them, convinces me that the USA is much further gone than I had even imagined.  It&rsquo;s an eye-opener.</p>
<p>The United Steelworkers (or at least its spokesman) appears to be cosily in bed with the extreme radicals, the anarchists, and the totalitarians! The ones who used to be considered the crazies. Now, they&rsquo;re running things.  These charming folks have NO respect for democratic procedures or the rights of others, nor even for common civility and civilized behavior. And these people, like Redmond, are now the ones in charge in many places. Frankly, it&rsquo;s getting to look like Haiti. </p>
<p>Does that picture of Redmond remind you of Papa Doc? No wonder the USA is sliding downhill so rapidly.  Get ready for a big crash. What we&rsquo;re seeing now is nothing so far.  There&rsquo;s constant hopeful talk about &#8220;pulling out of the recession&#8221;.  Nonsense!  What &#8220;recovery&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s not going to get better. I was reading Craig Roberts last night, and he says it&rsquo;s GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll skip the obvious on this one and ask a simple question. Do all of these leftist whackos receive the same memos, or do they all attend the same marxist conference? One that no hotel would ever turn down? </p>
<p>They all seem to talk alike and parrot the same marxist gibberish. &#8220;Taking a stand against hate.&#8221; If I&rsquo;ve heard that line once from one of these clowns, I&rsquo;ve heard it a thousand times. I wonder how long it took Mr redmond to come up with that well worn and oft plagiarized line? </p>
<p>One more point here Mr redmond. Jared Taylor is a very intelligent and resourceful man. He is going to hold his conference. Somewhere. And all that the likes of you and Mr imm will have accomplished, other than to secure for yourselves another nice warm fuzzy feeling, is to give American Renaissance far more publicity than any 10 uneventful conferences could have. This will no doubt swell our ranks. Thank you.</p>

		<p>The affirmative action social directors who represent hotel chains are attempting to proactively address discrimination lawsuits before they happen; businesses are often targeted by the NAACP and other organizations who seek to shake down big corporations with frivolous lawsuits, unfortunately this is the price of doing business in the United States, and one of the main reasons the United States is faltering.</p>
<p>American Renaissance should file a lawsuit against the hotel chain as victims of racial discrimination, the NAACP, SPLC, or ADL are all organizations that wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate in filing a lawsuit under similar circumstances. <br>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..<br>
 <br>
The consequence of being the world&rsquo;s wealthiest country and its superpower for over half a century.  We laid back and rested on our laurels, while much weaker and resourceless countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, etc. scrambled to focus  their efforts on achievement. They didn&rsquo;t own the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, or have its largest air force, navy, atom bombs, etc. They had nothing to rely on but their intelligence, ingenuity, and dedication to hard work.  </p>
<p>Exactly like Spain in its Golden Age, softened by a surfeit of easy wealth and power, we fell to the temptation of importing everything because that was cheaper and easier than making it at home. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, while Asian countries concentrated on things that mattered,  America&rsquo;s wealth and security allowed us the luxury to dabble in social engineering schemes and racial experiments  designed to appease our demanding minorities. The only appreciable threat to our peace was here at home, so we bought them off.  Consequently, we now look around and discover that our industries  and gold reserves are gone while our former client states, and once-backward countries like China,  own us!   We are in hock to them up to our eyeballs, and they now possess a great deal of our  technology and manufacturing as well, while we import our industrial goods from them (and from the rest of the world)&hellip;. when it used to be the other way around.   Uncle Sam has been a prodigal son!   Like a nouveau riche drunk on a half-century binge, intoxicated on his new-found wealth and power, foolish Sam has squandered his resources and advantages on meaningless frivolities;  and now he finds himself nearly broke.  It could all have been predicted.  There had to be a reckoning.</p>

		<p>Well this man is certainly entitled his opinion. And actually I&rsquo;m happy to see him appearing prosperous with his suit and occupation title that I doubt very much he could have achieved were he left to the resources of his race alone. He may even believe the things he said and I don&rsquo;t begrudge him this either. I know I hate no one because they are black or whatever race and I think the great majority that use this site have no cruel feelings toward any race. We simply go crazy watching the mass movement to dismantle our white race into oblivian. What really would Lincoln think of this mans statement and its popularity in this nation, given that we know he felt the black race inferior to his own? I just read an interesting reading..**{Julian against the Galileans}** The work is of a very good mind. and I think displays some of the root causes of our Euro world caving in. It is a critique against the Christian movement and what he felt foolish investment in the indigents of society. This writing covers many topics and regardles of ones religious views is a valuable look back at our heritage. I really hope some of you read it, I know White plight would like it.</p>

		<p>My guess is that attendees actually wear &#8220;nom de guerre&#8221; name tags for fear of being personally harassed by people like Fred Redmond.  The real situation here is that whites who want to save their racial identity have come to the point in their struggle were they have to hide from people him and others, who while wearing the symbol of freedom on their sleeve, are denying it to others based on their race and self interest.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think if whites acted to prevent another group from meeting, instead of what they usually do - fawn over these groups and label their activities the embodiment of diversity&hellip; if it were whites preventing another group from meeting I&rsquo;m pretty sure this would be labeled &#8216;hate&rsquo;. Even when these groups, multiple ones, are in every church and school and government office - whites are still the ones who &#8216;hate&rsquo; in regards to whether or not these interest groups are considered a good thing. That is, whites have to fumble over themselves proclaiming their allegiance lest they be taken to task or even declared an out and out figure of hatred.  </p>
<p>Can whites have even one an interest group anywhere?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll wager that this author never characterized Nelson Mandela in the terms he does Nick Griffin, though such terms fit the former far better.   Also, it is presumably not the government of Great Britain which Griffin represents that Mr. Redmond refers to as &#8220;a criminal organization&#8221;, but the BNP. </p>
<p>Since the BNP is not (at least, not yet) an illegal organization, that statement strikes me as slander.   </p>
<p>The use of the term &#8220;hoedown&#8221; in this article is a gratuitous slur, accomplishing nothing other than betraying the bigotry of the author. </p>
<p>The quote marks around the term &#8220;indigenous&#8221; are idiotic.   What a pathetic snippet of propaganda, to suggest that we should question whether indigenous Britons were white! </p>
<p>A final note:  &#8220;Renaissance&#8221; does not mean &#8220;overcoming bigotry&#8221;.  It means &#8220;rebirth&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Hmmm, is there a lawyer in the house?  I don&rsquo;t know what the legal standing of this statement is, considering it was used against an elected British representitive, by an U.S. citizen, in the USA.  If this had been written about Mr Griffin in a UK publication, I think he may well have grounds for a libel case. This isn&rsquo;t just some nobody he has lied about, but a high profile public official. </p>
<p>Also, I love the idea of taking the hotels to court on racial discrimination grounds.  Go for it!</p>

		<p>&#8220;British National Party, a white separatist group that contends immigrants are causing the &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; of &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; white Britons.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true for any country. Every country has  a people and a unique culture. If enough people from a different country and culture move in, the host country will transform to that of the new people. Imagine if Japan allowed millions of White French people to pour in to the point that the Japanese became a minority. Voila, Japan is Japan in name only as it now has become France. Demographics is destiny. It&rsquo;s called colonization. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the British want to remain British? Why shouldn&rsquo;t the Japanese want to remain Japanese, the Mexicans Mexican, the Americans American etc.<br>

		<p>The United Steel workers &#8220;union&#8221; is operating this way?  And Mr. Griffin is an MP, I thought.   Definitely, the name of the hotel should be offered, so people traveling to D.C. for other business may take their commitment to lack of free speech into account while choosing accomodations, although I&rsquo;m sorry people were threatened!   To think: the lives of workers&rsquo; families threatened  &mdash;  and possibly by workers&rsquo; unions!   Pure insanity!  The unions, I take it, only represent international workers against existing domestic dues payers.   But then, do &#8220;communists&#8221; ever help create jobs for anyone, lol?</p>

		<p>Maybe, the way things are going, the American Renaissance Conference will have to be held on an ocean liner outside the continental limit of the United States? A word of practical advice, I would avoid having conferences on either coast because the privileged elite&rsquo;s powers are most concentrated there. Of course, they will put pressure on all the popular hotel chains regardless of location. </p>

		<p>NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS and blacks have incompatible interests. The majority of post-1965 nonwhites must be thrown out of OUR AMERICA. There must be a separation from blacks. Blacks are the mortal enemy of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin is not a criminal. Bill Clinton-the first black president- is a well known criminal  He is a rapist and a War Criminal. Just ask the his rape victim and just ask the Serbian Civilian population.</p>
<p>The long over due separation from blacks starts with not watching young black multimillionaire running around in very tight spandex this Sunday..and not watching the 66 year old pedaphile Pete Townsend at half time.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton-the fist black president- and his wife Hillary-who egged him on to bomb the Serbian civilian population(the lies about Serbian atrocities have been exposed many times over. It took the MSM ten years to admit that it was all a pack of lies)-used their $$$$$ resources to separate themselves from blacks by buying a multimillion dollar home in lilly-white Scarsdale NY.</p>
<p>The rest of us want to seprate from blacks also Bill and Hillary(</p>

		<p>Interesting how the left always characterizes any views but their own as &#8220;hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that the left, worldwide, has a monopoly on love and tolerance.  This is clearly illustrated by the loving conduct of all communist regimes during the 20th Century, in which Russian Bolsheviks lovingly slaughtered an estimated 30-40 million of their own countrymen and effectively incarcerated the rest.  The loving Chinese Communists loved about 70 million of their citizens to death.  Pol Pot and his loving Kmher Rouge affectionately put fully one third of the population of Cambodia to death. Fidel Castro turned Cuba into one big ongoing love-fest, killing tens of thousands and effectively incarcerating the rest in an orgy of love directed toward &#8220;the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>And throughout all these inspiring instances of loving concern, communist regimes managed to virtually eliminate obesity among their populations, ensuring a diet of not more than 900 calories a day, excepting of course for the ruling class, which selflessly assumed the burden of risking heart and circulatory problems borne of excessive eating and drinking.</p>
<p>History amply demonstrates that leftist movements are love-based, assuming the heavy burden of forcing people to do what they clearly don&rsquo;t want to do, but entirely for their own good.</p>

<p>Yes. That is true. I became aware or Amren because some loon mentioned it in some article condeming hate. The used the same rhetoric against Rush Limbaugh twenty years ago (back when he was interesting). The left is really setting themselves up for a fall. When the left goes nuts over hate, bigotry, etc. people get curious and check it out. Then when they see that all the &#8216;hate&rsquo; amounts to common sense views that they share, who looks bad?  The next step is then to examine who and what the left really is.</p>

		<p>Note that this dork has been made VP of &#8220;Human Affairs,&#8221; an obviously made-up position in order to get a black in the administration.  The title could cover almost anything. The member&rsquo;s money in the Steel Worker&rsquo;s Union is being spent on foolish, political agendas, just as it is in most other unions.  </p>
<p>In other words, the union members are paying for the union bosses&rsquo; costs for a worthless position that is strictly for the purpose of being politically correct.  How much is this political hack getting for doing absolutely nothing but offering his black face to the world?</p>
<p>The bottom line effect is that this black slacker has done more to out himself than he has to hurt the WN movement, because he probably was able to cloak himself in a low-profile position, allowing the union to keep him and his outrageous freebie salary hid from the members, but he&rsquo;s now put himself in the front where he&rsquo;s highly visible.  If I were a member of that union, I would demand that he be ousted.  Does he do anything at all, but complain about whites?</p>
<p>I believe his position would fall under the category of corporate welfare&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..or in this case union welfare&hellip;&hellip;.. to appease the black contentious elements. The so-called representatives of the working class are nothing more than greed mongers themselves, just like the ones in the corporate world. </p>

<p>He was given a pass, constantly and consistently, by the media, but more recently the hostile elites have turned on him and Hillary  &mdash;  and they know it.  What goes around comes around&hellip;..</p>
<p>Jupiter, if it&rsquo;s any consolation to you, the hostile elites have dropped and now shun Billary Clinton  &mdash;  their glory days are LONG over.  Hilary recently stated that she will not continue as Secretary of State  &mdash;  she well knows she was tossed that position like a bone to get her and Bill out of the way and that she&rsquo;s been abandoned.  She&rsquo;s seen the handwriting on the wall, so to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Hillary Clinton Says Four Years as Secretary of State Will Be Enough&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is from the marvelous new book, &#8216;Game Change&rsquo; about the turning of the press:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;During the New Hampshire primary&hellip;. Fox News asked [Hillary] how she responded to accusations that she was denigrating Martin Luther King&rsquo;s memory by running against hope&hellip;.  Her campaign right away realized she&rsquo;d made a mistake and inserted a few lines praising MLK in a speech she was to give that night&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then New York Times editorialized that the Clinton campaign &#8216;came perilously close to injecting racial tension&rsquo;&hellip;  Days later on the front page.. Black Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn would call Bill&rsquo;s comments &#8216;insulting.&rsquo;:</p>
<p>Bill Clinton&rsquo;s first reaction was astonishment, followed by rage&hellip;  Their words were being twisted, bent out of shape in a way that suggested something more malign.</p>
<p>&#8216;After everything I did for civil rights in Arkansas!  After everything I did in the White House!  They know **** well I don&rsquo;t have a racist bone in my body!&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Great Stuff!   </p>
<p>Soon, if they haven&rsquo;t already, the elite masters will tire of obama and turn on him as well  &mdash;  he&rsquo;s already served his purpose (set in motion the collapse of the economy and dollar and expanded an unpopular and unwinnable war) and will further serve as the scapegoat.  He will, however, leave the White House wealthy, perhaps this was promised to him for serving in this &#8216;mea culpa&rsquo; role.</p>

I posted a response to this article on their site that in no way could be considered offensive or justify censorship, in fact it was far less harsh in opinion than their article yet they censored it and failed to post it. By failing to allow the dissenting posts they are engaged in the selective dissemination of information as a way to give the illusion that their article&rsquo;s position is the overwhelmingly popular one.

		<p>Orwell so famously got it right with his War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength bit because he knew that lying was the only way leftists could get their thing done.  So, it&rsquo;s unavoidable that lefties always display this behavior while going about getting their thing done.</p>
<p><i>Hate is Freedom</i></p>
<p>Huffpo pretends the left is acting against hate, when what they&rsquo;re really doing is acting against freedom.  They all scream when the right takes their tricks, though (War on Terror is silly, War against Hate is a-okay; Lenin&rsquo;s Imperative: who?  Whom?).</p>
<p><i>Cowardice is Courage</i></p>
<p>Huffpo pretends the hotels are &#8220;taking a stand,&#8221; when in truth they&rsquo;re cowering under the table.  This sort of language is so ingrained in leftists that it&rsquo;s second nature by now.</p>
<p><i>in the U.S. renaissance means overcoming bigotry.</i></p>
<p>Bigotry is of course far more fundamental to and common in the left.  The left goes insane over the fact that a few of us exist AND the suggestion that we part ways; we just want to part ways.  Bigotry is of course far more consistent with advocating (and pressuring) all hotels to bar a conference than it is with trying to fly under the radical leftist zealot radar so we can have a meet and greet.  Bigotry is &#8220;the stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one&rsquo;s own.&#8221; If &#8220;liberals&rsquo;&#8221; and leftists&rsquo; behavior toward ethnic patriots isn&rsquo;t bigotry, nothing is.  Racial bigots, that&rsquo;s what they are.  The right knows this perfectly well, which is why there&rsquo;s barely a farthing&rsquo;s worth of difference between mainstream right and left vis-a-vis race; the right lives in terror of the leftist bigots and their accusations of &#8220;bigotry!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the funny part of that quote gets right to the heart of the axiom so beloved of the left, Lenin&rsquo;s Imperative: &#8220;who?  Whom?&#8221;; leftists <i>had</i> their revolution*, back in the 1960s.  But like the neocons and 1939 Germany, for the leftists it&rsquo;s always 1959 and we&rsquo;re always in need of a revolution.  The reason for this is simple; it rationalizes a perpetual leftist regime.  It rationalizes perpetual screw-tightening.  The Commies did the same thing in Russia, and other places; the revolution was a permanent one, their secret police were there to protect against &#8220;counter-revolutionaries,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>*He says &#8220;renaissance&#8221; but what he really means is &#8220;revolution.&#8221;  The ideology of racial amalgamation cannot be &#8220;reborn&#8221; because it&rsquo;s still living out its first life.</p>
<p>Psychopaths and useful idiots, the lot.  Point at these people and laugh; it&rsquo;s entertaining, and they deserve it.</p>
