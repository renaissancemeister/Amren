<h1>Admissions Materials Go Bilingual</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Baobao Zhang, Yale Daily News, February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The admissions office&rsquo;s efforts to reach out to Spanish speakers might soon have some singing, &#8220;Por eso escogí Yale!&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to providing subtitles for the hit admissions video, &#8220;That&rsquo;s Why I Chose Yale,&#8221; in several languages including Spanish, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions&rsquo; new Web site, set to launch this summer, will include both English and Spanish versions of key pages and possibly downloadable documents of admissions materials in Spanish. These efforts are part of a national trend among colleges and universities to provide admissions information to prospective Latino students whose parents are not fluent in English.</p>
<p>Dean of Admissions Jeff Brenzel noted that prospective students must be proficient enough in English to understand admissions material without translation; these new efforts are instead aimed at parents, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indeed, on top of the pressure of filling out applications, writing essays and attending interviews, some Latino students said they have the added task of explaining the college admissions process to their parents who are not fluent in English.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Zepeda said having admissions material that Spanish-speaking parents could better understand will help future admitted students to navigate their college decisions more easily.</p>
<p>Nelson Mendoza &#8216;13, who is from Houston, said an admitted student Web site featuring information in Spanish would help parents. Still, he said when he applied to college, other schools, such as MIT, did a better job of reaching out by providing information sessions at community centers rather than in far-off suburbs.</p>
<p>To address some of these concerns, Yale has student recruiters and admissions officers who can speak to parents in several languages, including Spanish. The admissions office also plans to launch a series of videos on its admitted students Web site in which first generation college students at Yale speak in their native languages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yale also uses Spanish-speaking alumni to answer questions at host receptions in several cities, Brenzel said.<br>

		<p>I wonder how many languages they will translate their things in?  Mongolians must not be made to feel unwelcome.</p>
<p>How long before those colleges have bilingual classes and are roped into opening urban academies and such?</p>

<p>Does this mean that now, even if they want to study in an institution such as Yale, immigrants will not even be required to be proficient in English?</p>
<p>Gosh&hellip; back when I was a young student, and was filling out application papers, it was made very clear that students with foreign credentials who wanted to study in an American University were to go through an English exam. And an interview (in English, of course).</p>
<p>Times change. It makes me feel like the America I loved is dying&hellip; And for what? Well, among other things, for illegals, most of whom are Latino, and who don&rsquo;t even have the right to live in the US in the first place (legally)!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad, and so unfair. And so stupid!</p>
<p>Excuse me, I think I am going to be sick&hellip;</p>

		<p>I dont ever remember surrendering my culture to these people? When did Americans decide that it was alright for a people of a lesser nation to decide what language WE speak in our home country? Americans are sick and tired of seeing information printed in some foreign language. I recently purchased some furniture and the directions were nothing more than pictures with spanish captions. Our nation is slowly but surely devolving into an extention of the third world nation that borders us to the south. We CANNOT sit idly by and let these thieves steal our nation from us. We are descendant from the greatest people in the history of the world, and we are losing ourselves to a nation that cannot even provide running water to its people. It is humiliating and must come to an end.  </p>

		<p>I think I understand what you are saying. Admission forms for the great Ivy league universities will now be mulilingual. A bit like what they do here for social security application forms!</p>

		<p>To Nordic Wolf and Oz - my nomination for the most sickning is the voter&rsquo;s ballot which faithfully translates every English into Spanish. If you&rsquo;re an illegal, you&rsquo;re not entitled to be voting. If you are legal, you need to speak English and surly need to know what&rsquo;s going on before you vote. Voting is one of the primary privileges of legal, loyal Americans, and so many of today&rsquo;s new &#8220;citizens&#8221; still prefer to hang onto their old countries with only their hands out to America.</p>

		<p>Since diversity initiatives only benefit non-Whites, it is important that minorities receive every opportunity to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; the White culture that they are so dependent upon for survival.</p>

		<p>givin how pro-left colleges are I&rsquo;m a bit surprised that the major colleges didn&rsquo;t stop requiring english language proficiency back in like 1990.</p>

		<p>I see this as one more step in America&rsquo;s glacial movement down the same awful road Canada has gone down. Probably with even worse results.</p>
