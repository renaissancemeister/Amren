			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Errin Haines, AOL News, February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The message on dozens of billboards across the city is provocative: Black children are an &#8220;endangered species.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The eyebrow-raising ads featuring a young black child are an effort by the anti-abortion movement to use race to rally support within the black community.</p>
<p>This anti-abortion billboard in Atlanta featuring a young black child is part of an effort by the anti-abortion movement to use race to rally support within the black community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The billboards went up last week in Atlanta and urge black women to &#8220;get outraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black women accounted for the majority of abortions in Georgia in 2006, even though blacks make up just a third of state population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Nationally, black women were more than three times as likely to get an abortion in 2006 compared with white women, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anti-abortion advocates say the procedure has always been linked to race. They claim Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger wanted to eradicate minorities by putting birth control clinics in their neighborhoods, a charge Planned Parenthood denies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2008, Issues4Life, a California-based group working to end abortion in the black community, lobbied Congress to stop funding Planned Parenthood, calling black abortions &#8220;the Darfur of America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pro-Life Action League Executive Director Eric Scheidler said a race-based strategy for anti-abortion activists has gotten a fresh zeal, especially in the wake of the historic election of the country&rsquo;s first black president, Barack Obama, who supports abortion rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To use racist arguments to try to bait black people to get them to be anti-abortion is just disgusting,&#8221; said Guy-Sheftall, who teaches women&rsquo;s history and feminist thought at the historically black women&rsquo;s college.</p>
<p>&#8220;These one-issue approaches that are not about saving the black family or black children, it&rsquo;s just a big distraction,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Many black people don&rsquo;t know who Margaret Sanger is and could care less.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This insipid campaign is yet another example of something that has become the norm rather than the exception: directing the focus away from real problems.  It is apparent to anyone with half of a brain that the real problem lies in the lack of sexual restraint shown by Blacks.  This has been further exacerbated by the &#8220;impregnate-and-ditch&#8221; mentality (long culturally acceptable) among Black males.  Despite tripling the number of White abortions, Blacks still outbreed Whites in this country by a healthy margin.  What does that show??  A use of condoms might help.  Everyone knows that these 40% of Blacks killed by abortion would otherwise be out on the streets committing murder, robbery, and rape.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at actual data.  In 1965, greater than 85% of USA citizens were White.  Today, that number is 65%, and 50 years from now (based on demographics of children), will be around 40%.  </p>
<p>In less than 50 years, the percentage of Whites in the population has plummeted, and continues to plummet at an astounding rate.  Yet, what we see is a billboard about blacks being endangered.  Imagine the uproar if somehow put up a billboard stating that Whites were endangered.  Such is the insane, PC world we live in.<br>

		<p>Black abortion truly is the dilemma for Christian White Nationalists.  Fewer blacks means less dangers for whites, but do we want foetal genocide to be the way we get less danger?  Won&rsquo;t Jesus condemn us for secretly accepting black abortions in particular, while being against abortion in general?</p>
<p>The libertarian sentiment says if a mother wants to kill her own baby, who am I to care? Isn&rsquo;t coming between a mother and her baby an overbearing intrusion of a sacred relationship? Fetecide is between her and the fetus, not her and outsiders.</p>
<p>But as idealists, we want to know that a baby in the womb is protected from harm, for if not, what protections can we who are outside of the womb ever expect?</p>
<p>Maybe we could bargain with Jesus. Please let the babies be born, but help them get back home to Africa as soon as possible, please. And if you won&rsquo;t send them to Africa and just can&rsquo;t help but leave them here, can you please explain to them that whites have civil and human rights that should protect us from robbing, raping, and murdering?</p>
<p>Dear Jesus in Heaven, please help me. Please purge from my mind the evil that says to me &#8220;Every aborted black baby won&rsquo;t ever rob, rape, or murder my sweet Christian daughter.&#8221; Please help me to limit my conclusions about the war of races. Dear Jesus, please save us from the pestilence that divides us from your holiness by forcing upon us cruel acceptances of the mitigations of a cruel and unnatural national reality.</p>
<p>I refuse Odin&rsquo;s call. I am sickened, and he offers no healing.</p>

		<p>Although blacks have a higher abortion rate than whites their higher birth rate overall means that they still have a higher rate of population growth than whites.  Black children are far from an endangered species.  I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you, but I haven&rsquo;t noticed any dearth of black people.</p>

		<p>I remain incredulous re. the statistics that claim that Blacks have more abortions that Whites just as I doubt the ones that still show Blacks to be only 13% of the US population. With notable exceptions like the Duggars and Octomom, how often do you see White women with five children?</p>

		<p>Condoms are better than abortions but abortions are still better than an even larger underclass of poor blacks who then drain society of its resources. Do the anti-abortionists have a financial plan to cover the costs for all these births by indigent young black females? I doubt it.</p>

		<p>I lean toward the pro-life view but am conflicted about it because without abortion blacks, and the problems they bring with them, would be an even greater percentage of the population than they are now.</p>
<p>I think a more practical solution to keeping their numbers in check would be to pay any black female of child-bearing age $50,000 to submit to sterilization. In addition, we could pay any black male $25,000 to submit to a vasectomy. It would be money incredibly well spent, and it would allow them to live their lives free of the consequences of their boundless promiscuity.</p>
<p>This investment in insuring the future of this nation would be a relative pittance.</p>

		<p>I have to admit, that I am somewhat skeptical about this article. I am a recently retired physician who now lives in Florida. I had a practie in the northeast for 32 years.  I retired in December 2008. While I refused to perfomr abortions except for incidents of rape, incest or the life of the mother was in danger, I had many other colleagues who had no problem doing so. </p>
<p>I would have to say that the overwhelming majority of women who seeked abortions were White. Moreover, the majority were upscale as well. </p>
<p>I have always been of the belief that abortion has been a form of birth control for nice suburban, privileged (mostly White)girls. That is why the feminists have been so adamant in maintaining abortion rights.  </p>

		<p>If anyone truly tried to limit black abortions, people like Sharpton and Jackson would be screaming about black women&rsquo;s rights being curtailed!  But, of course, they can have it both ways because the loony left would criticize them, and the vast majority of Americans don&rsquo;t give a hoot what these race-whiners think, whether it regards black abortion or whether the pharohs were flying black people.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve read that 1/2 of black pregnancies are aborted.  Of course, blacks make up only about 12-13% of the U.S. population, so the fact is not as noticable as it might be if they were of greater numbers.  Many black children also die of abuse and neglect, and black young men die in out-sized numbers due to drugs and murder.  Blacks, as well as Australoids, are doomed to either become subsumed in more successful races or to die out.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a good idea. Another would be to have mandatory sterilization as a condition for parole for all prisoners convicted of a felony. This would apply to all races but would exclude first time offenders. Ex-cons don&rsquo;t make good parents and this policy would save the tax-payers an enormous amount of money as well as reduce child abuse and the creation of future criminals. But we all know that, for obvious reasons, such a policy would never be implemented.</p>

		<p>Margaret Sanger started Planned Parenthood because she noticed how many babies blacks would have-often times in the teens,or as many as they could physically have.Planned Parenthood saved our country from being swamped with millions of more blacks who would have made the whole situation much worse for everyone of all races. She is without a doubt the greatest hero our country has ever had. </p>

		<p>I am Pro-Life with exceptions, I am Pro-Life regarding healthy white babies and Pro-Abortion for Black or Mexican ones, and in cases of rape or severe medical conditions.</p>
<p>We must look at the big picture. I for one would rather Blacks and Mexicans have more abortions than our country have a larger population of Blacks and Mexicans. Abortion is indeed morally wrong in most cases I believe, but non whites are a different story, in their case I believe it would be morally wrong for us to oppose their abortions. These abortions will save the lives of whites and prevent countless rapes and lower the overall crime rate. Yes, I do think the ends justify the means in this case. I think we have a moral duty to encourage non-White abortions. Consider also that whites have fewer children on average.</p>
<p>Our policy positions should be based on only one consideration: what is best for our race. Nothing else ultimately matters, all other considerations are counter-productive. Why must we seek to impose our morals to other races? Why should we concern ourselves with how they live insofar as it does not adversely effect us?</p>

		<p>Peejay&hellip;.remember that movie &#8220;Cheaper By The Dozen&#8221; with Clifton Web and how the planned parenthood ladies went to their house to advise them to not have so many kids?  </p>
<p>Of course they had to show a WHITE family (who was responsible for their offspring) as the reason for all these kids being born and not a black or other nonwhite family who rely on the taxpayers.. Wonder why that is? </p>
<p>I was born into a big WHITE family back in the 40&rsquo;s and my parents stayed together for life and raised all their children with no help from the taxpayer and I believe that is how most White families were back then. They raised God-fearing and productive children that were a plus for society. Then came the Civil Rights movement and desegregation and the 1965 Immigration Act and this nation has fallen apart ever since. The America I loved and grew up in is no longer and will never be again. </p>
<p>In the near future there will be mandatory sterilization when there are not enough WHITES to pay the tab for all these nonwhites and their offspring, if Whites are even allowed to exist by then.</p>

<p>I think there is a minor precedent to your prescribed double standard.  The segregationist system in the South didn&rsquo;t punish non-serious moral turpitude among and between blacks, such as gambling and prostitution, as they did when it happened either among whites or between whites and blacks.  That is an example of racially realist whites doing as you want, not imposing their &#8220;prudish&#8221; (such as it is) moral codes on blacks.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t like abortion as a principle, and I strongly and unequivocally oppose white women pregnant with healthy white children having abortions. In an all-white (or nearly all-white) society I would therefore favor a ban on abortions.  </p>
<p>Still, because of the higher black abortion rate and because of the need for abortions in cases where white women make the mistake of having unprotected sex with black (or other non-white) men and get pregnant as a result, I am content with having legal abortion given the current situation. And considering the fact that government subsidies to abortion would disproprtionately increase abortions among blacks, I actually favor that too.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Christain and against abortion of any kind even if it&rsquo;s a black baby.  I know God is testing me and my faith and he doesn&rsquo;t take too kindly to hypocrites who think it&rsquo;s ok if they&rsquo;re black.  It&rsquo;s probably unrealistic to expect blacks to ahere to some kind of birth control so I think all the abortion clinics in the inner cities need to be converted to sterilization clinics.  I would be willing to bet that these people would do it for a ridiculously low amount of cash reimbursement, say $500.  </p>

		<p>Unk Sam said &#8220;Maybe we could bargain with Jesus. Please let the babies be born, but help them get back home to Africa as soon as possible, please. And if you won&rsquo;t send them to Africa and just can&rsquo;t help but leave them here, can you please explain to them that whites have civil and human rights that should protect us from robbing, raping, and murdering?&#8221;</p>
<p>No offense intended but&hellip; how realistic is that? The reasons blacks are more violent and commit more crime are genetic in nature, they have higher testosterone levels than whites and lower IQ&rsquo;s on average. It isn&rsquo;t a question of morality but of biology. Unless God is going to change the genetic structure of blacks we can&rsquo;t expect them to change their behavior - its all hard wired and genetically predetermined. We aren&rsquo;t going to change blacks. </p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Jesus in Heaven, please help me. Please purge from my mind the evil that says to me &ldquo;Every aborted black baby won&rsquo;t ever rob, rape, or murder my sweet Christian daughter.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Your gut reaction is perfectly reasonable, you seem to feel guilty for harboring this reasonable sentiment. We should base our values and our policy positions - again - on what is good for us. </p>
<p>&#8220;Please help me to limit my conclusions about the war of races. Dear Jesus, please save us from the pestilence that divides us from your holiness by forcing upon us cruel acceptances of the mitigations of a cruel and unnatural national reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you are asking Jesus to stop you from thinking for yourself and coming to perfectly reasonable conclusions about race - because those conclusions make you feel guilty&hellip; I urge you shed your guilt but not your natural and reasonable sentiments. </p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse Odin&rsquo;s call. I am sickened, and he offers no healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not an Odinist, but in all honesty I think that the Churches have done great damage to our race and to white nations. They teach love for our enemies and mercy towards them, it it suicidal and harmful. I think we need more Odins and less Christs. as Johnny Cash said in a song &#8220;this world is rough and if a man&rsquo;s gonna make it he&rsquo;s gotta be tough.&#8221; Mercy and compassion are wasted when they are awarded to an unworthy and hostile enemy. I for one don&rsquo;t have any compassion left for those who would destroy me and my race forever.   <br>

<p>I agree with you. Most Blacks are more likely to keep their children as opposed to abort them. On the contrary, White, especially upper income Whites are all too eager to abort their unwanted children. This is partly why we are in the predicament we are in today.</p>

		<p>I always thought the abortion issue focused on white women. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the shame factor! </p>
<p>It would be for me, at least; pregnant with no husband and knowing I&rsquo;d be struggling all my days to give the kid some sort of life. I&rsquo;ve known of several white girls from prominent &#8216;church&rsquo; families that have had abortions, with their parents backing it. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem that blacks are too concerned enough to try to get an abortion. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m totally pro-life on secular grounds. I&rsquo;ve been a pro-life witness at a Planned Parenthood, and they used a very similar sign with a black child. It&rsquo;s a talking point among the prolife. </p>
<p>I lost my closest relative and several other close relatives to being aborted: a sibling, a half-sibling, and 3 first cousins. That makes six white children counting myself (or, I should say, three I&rsquo;m positive were white, and I&rsquo;m 99% sure the others were all-white too) who were to have started crawling around in the seventies, reduced to just one (me) with only one child. This makes me think that an intransigently pro-white AND pro-life emphasis is my new perspective to strive for, without disrespecting anyone else, but without apologizing for of changing my focus on Europids. I agree with RETIRED DOCTOR that there is a very special problem among whites targeted for participation in abortion by radical feminism/environmentalism; and if you&rsquo;re still around, I wish you&rsquo;d point me to some resources that say that kind of thing in more depth.</p>
