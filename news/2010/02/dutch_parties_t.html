<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61M08120100223">Dutch Parties Tussle Over Approach to Far Right</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catherine Hornby, Reuters, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Geert] Wilders and his Freedom Party have been a focus of debate since the Dutch cabinet collapsed on Saturday, as the election which could be held as early as May will be a key opportunity for the anti-immigration group to increase its influence after a stunning success at European elections last year.</p>
<p>Frans Timmermans, a member of the Labour party and minister for European affairs, said on Monday that Labour would refuse to govern in coalition with Wilders&rsquo; party, and he called on other parties to consider a similar approach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders has described the call as an &#8220;arrogant&#8221; attempt to ringfence his Freedom Party (PVV) and said it was an insult to the democratic system, telling Dutch media &#8220;the voter will seek punishment for this&#8221;.</p>
<p>Members of other parties have also described the move as undemocratic and warned that it could push voters into the arms of Wilders, considered a maverick among the political elite.</p>
<p>While the socialist SP said it would not consider working in coalition with Wilders&rsquo; party due to their policy differences, it criticised Timmermans nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is unbelievably stupid. What Timmermans is saying is undemocratic, the voter can surely make up their own mind,&#8221; said SP leader Agnes Kant in the Dutch daily Trouw. &#8220;Wilders can now say there is a barrier being built around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of other parties also dismissed the calls, with the head of the Liberal VVD party Mark Rutte telling Dutch radio he was not ruling anyone out as a potential coalition partner and Christian Democrat party chairman Pieter van Geel describing the comments as foolish.</p>
<p>POISED FOR GAINS</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; party comes first or second in most polls for the next election, and could win up to 24 seats in the 150-seat Dutch Parliament after becoming the second biggest Dutch party in the EU Parliament last year.</p>
<p>So far the CDA and VVD have left the door open to be in a coalition with Wilders. But in recent polls, just 27 percent of respondents said their reaction to a combination of the three in a cabinet would be &#8216;positive&rsquo; or &#8216;very positive&rsquo;.</p>

This report is far more encouraging than I was expecting; one pol expresses his coalition preference (fine, though he went to far in trying guilt others into colluding with him in blackballing the PVV), meanwhile the PVV is first or second in most polls.</p>

		<p>What amazes me is that the liberals have no problem taking (or attempting to take) rights away from those with whom they disagree.  What they fail to see is that they will also lose their rights when the people they fight so hard to protect over their own people finally take power.<br/>

<p>I say great, it&rsquo;s time these cretins were relegated to sidelines anyway. They are the cause of the catastrophe in Europe in the first place.</p>

		<p>From my perspective as a legal permanent resident of Holland, I can honestly say Wilder&rsquo;s &#8216;Freedom Party&rsquo; (Partei voor Vreiheid - PVV) actually gets seemingly fair media coverage.  He and the other PVV candidate are included in debates, are seen on TV discussing their positions and are generally treated well.  </p>
<p>While there are shrill individuals repeating the tired racist screed, and there is a die-hard marxist/leftist section of the electorate that would NEVER work with them; I feel that a majority of the dutch population are sympathetic to the positions of the PVV.</p>
<p>Americans must keep in mind that &#8216;multi-culturalism&rsquo; was only introduced and sold to the Dutch beginning in the 1970&rsquo;s - 80&rsquo;s.  Since then, none of the purported benefits have materialized.  Instead the Dutch see the formation of no-go zones in the muslim enclaves, indeed, muslim enclaves exist!  They seen their sons and daughters assulted, basically all the attendant problems but none of the benefits.</p>
<p>Now, that does not mean the Dutch are becoming less tolerant; in fact tolerance and a strong national character and values are not mutually exclusive.  </p>

		<p>Same thing in England. The main political parties constantly deny that the BNP has no impact whatsoever on the British electorate. But this is not quite true, most are really concerned, even those high profile ministers who will shortly be voted out of office. Thing is, because they have been &#8216;gagged&rsquo; about mentioning the BNP except in an unfavourable light, there are few MSM comments.<br/>

		<p>  Geert Wilders has been demonized so much by the multicultural left; I&rsquo;m surprised they don&rsquo;t depict him as the devil in Faust or at Christmas pageants. It will be a miracle if he can avoid jail or worse in post Dutch Holland.</p>

		<p>Hopefully Wilders will become the Netherland&rsquo;s next PM, and I also hope such politicians as he will rise to power throughout Europe. Small wonder the leftist cosmopolitan elites in his country have put him on a show trial!</p>

 <br/>
PvdA (workers party) GL (Green Left) SP (Socialist Party Maoist) PvdD (party for the animals) D66 They all are Marxist Communist and have sold the Dutch down the diversity Islam Immigration drain.</p>
<p>The CDA (Christian Democrates) are a bunch of power hungry christian marxist, not much better than the left.</p>
<p>Expect Wilders to be assasinated prior to the June general elections, like they did with Pim Fortuyn in 2002, The bullet will come from the left.</p>
