			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times, February 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The growth of charter schools has promoted segregation both in California and nationwide, increasing the odds that black, Latino and white students will attend class with fewer children who look different from themselves, according to two new studies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Charters are independently managed public schools that are exempt from some rules that govern traditional schools. About 2.5% of the nation&rsquo;s students attend charters  &mdash;  a threefold increase over seven years. The Los Angeles Unified School District has more charters  &mdash;  enrolling about 9% of district students  &mdash;  than any school system in the country.</p>
<p>The trend toward segregation was especially notable for African American students. Nationally, 70% of black charter students attend schools where at least 90% of students are minorities. That&rsquo;s double the figure for traditional public schools. The typical black charter-school student attends a campus where nearly three in four students also are black, researchers with the Civil Rights Project at UCLA said Thursday.</p>
<p>The other researchers also focused on economic segregation, looking at private companies that manage schools, in most cases charters. The enrollments at most of these campuses exacerbated income extremes, they concluded. Charters tended to serve higher-income students or lower-income students. Charters also were likely to serve fewer disabled students and fewer English learners. This report, soon to be officially released, was developed by education policy centers at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Arizona State University.</p>
<p>Both research teams, using somewhat different methods and data, questioned the direction of the Obama administration, which has pushed states to authorize more charter schools as a condition for receiving funding through &#8220;Race to the Top&#8221; grants. That position has proved to be powerful leverage as states struggle with decreased funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want the Race to the Top to become a race to the past,&#8221; said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project, alluding to the era of enforced segregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>L.A. Unified also includes charters with high white enrollments; about half were traditional schools that already had high white enrollments when they became charters.</p>
<p>Some charter organizations serve largely low-income Latino enrollments  &mdash;  in neighborhoods where nearly all students match that description. Such charter organizations as the Alliance for College-Ready Public Schools have, in effect, tried to make segregation irrelevant by offering a college-prep curriculum in small classes within small schools.</p>
<p>The school district itself has left behind integration as a primary goal. Its school construction program, for example, is aimed at returning students to their neighborhood schools rather than their being bused elsewhere. But segregation is exacerbated in the process.</p>
<p>Given a school district that is 9% white, segregated by income and race, and predominantly poor, school quality has to trump hard-to-achieve integration, said L.A. schools Supt. Ramon C. Cortines.</p>
<p>&#8220;If charter schools are doing the job for the student, and it is a better job&#8221; than the traditional school, Cortines said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not as concerned about the racial isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orfield&rsquo;s team isn&rsquo;t ready to surrender on integration. He proposes expanding magnet schools, which are special programs designed to attract diverse enrollments and thus promote desegregation. Alternatively, he said, charters should be required  &mdash;  and helped  &mdash;  to promote diversity.<br>

		<p>At least in Missouri, charters are a big failure in terms of actual academics.  That is because the only two places where charter schools are allowed are in the City of St. Louis and in Kansas City proper.  Thus far, every approved and sponsored charter has been black-focused.  The St. Louis City Police Officers Association, referenced here on AR earlier this week, wanted to start a charter school that either revolved around law enforcement careers or was limited to the offspring of city cops, can&rsquo;t remember which.  But they were rejected.</p>

<p>And what is wrong with that?  Can the multicults point to any segregated schools where blacks attend that are not problematic in some way, strictly due to the trouble and dumbing down blacks carry with them wherever they go?</p>
<p>Integrated public education is a failure.  It&rsquo;s unequivocal.  There are no gray areas.  It just doesn&rsquo;t work.  Integration doesn&rsquo;t help blacks in anyway and it is truly seriously harmful to whites.</p>
<p>But I do have to add that failure in no way prevents multicults from pursuing their mentally disturbed vision of a rainbow of happy faces steeped in love and tolerance.  So this failed  school system will continue to fail no matter how many tricks they try to pull and under whatever name they wish to give it.</p>
<p>I might just point out, however, that whatever further devious manipulations the academics and politicians want to try to continue the cover up of the real reasons for failure they had better do it right away&hellip;like immediately&hellip;&hellip;because funding is dropping so quickly in every level of education money will simply not be there to pay for the pursuit of pet theories, useless class subjects, and agendas promoted by the mentally disturbed.</p>
<p>48 states of the 50 are now in danger of going broke if they do not cut back severely on their budgets.  Next year will be worse by a factor of about 4.  The year after will be close to meltdown.</p>
<p>Party time for the libs is quickly coming to an end, and it is through their own hare-brained policies we will see ourselves emerge as winners in the culture war.</p>

		<p>As a former teacher in the CA public schools and as a grandparent of 4 gifted white boys, I totally support the charter programs in our state.  The kids I taught in public school were 98% Hispanic, and any reasonably bright kid of any race would have been frustrated at their slow learning rate.  My gifted grandkids cannot be held back by slower kids, so they are both home-schooled and charter-schooled.  Yes, the charter school kids where my grandkids are are mainly white   &mdash;   the white and Asian kids seem to be the ones who learn fastest and retain the most.  We are NOT going to allow our kids to be held back by a bunch of dim bulbs.  Charter schools have worked well in CA; even the mainly black ones have a much higher rate of achievement than the public schools.  We&rsquo;re inundated by non-English speaking Hispanics, and that has destroyed the quality of our public schools.</p>

		<p>How are they going to integrate a school district that is only 9% white? We all know &#8216;integration&rsquo; is code for putting troublesome black and Hispanic kids into white schools. Looks like there&rsquo;s not enough whites to go around. Diversity is always just a transition phase to an all black and brown environment where the traditional achievement level of blacks and browns will prevail.</p>

		<p>The fact is that while affluent White liberals give lip service to racial diversity, they rarely practice it. They have no problem being around certain Blacks (i.e the Huxtable types). In fact they welcome such Blacks into their schools and neighborhoods, but when it comes to embracing the real down lower income blacks they supposedly care so much about, they run like hell!! </p>

		<p>The real point, if you do not live in a mostly white area, is to get your children out of public education completely and into private schools. Away from any attempts at integration and far away from minority, affirmative action administrators and barely literate teachers whose main goal, besides keeping a job, is fiddling every year with a curriculum designed to &#8220;close the achievement gap.&#8221; Find some way to get the money - find out where Asians and Jews send their kids - or ask for their advice in finding new, under the radar schools. They exist. Talk to home schoolers. Whatever. Blacks will never personally spend a dime on education - we have to unfortunately buy our way out of this mess. I used to look at it as a tax on whites - now I see it as tithing to save white heritage.   <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the utter collapse of the liberal argument that black underachievement is caused by white racism, culturally biased testing, bad teachers, and leaky school buildings.  Then all the white libs and their black allies can do is shuttle the mass of low-IQ students into separate (racially segregated) schools and allow them to compete for good grades at their own level.  Then the lefties can pretend the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Some urban blacks have already called for this solution, insisting that blacks can learn better with their own kind. </p>

		<p>Olewhitelady, #8   &mdash;   I hope you&rsquo;re right.  Blacks, the lower class ones anyway, NEED to be with their own kind.  All they do is lower the standards wherever they show up, and their behavior is atrocious.  I once taught a 1st grade class in a primarily black area, and the level of violence in MY grade level that year surpassed any grade level in the Hispanic area schools where I subsequently taught.  Ghetto blacks are violent, and need to be segregated with their own teachers of their own kind.  It&rsquo;s safer for all of us that way.</p>

		<p>One look at The Civil Rights Project (Proyecto Derechos Civiles)website will reveal what kind of people they are.</p>
<p>Like all good lefties, they want to use coercive state power to reshape society and control the behavior of free people.  </p>
<p>They want to &#8220;renew the civil rights movement&#8221; in order to end all &#8220;racial isolation&#8221;.  They want to &#8220;maintain diversity&#8221; where it exists and discourage &#8220;resegregation&#8221;.  They want to see &#8220;Dr. King&rsquo;s dream realized, where race no longer matters&#8221;.  </p>
<p>They criticize the Supreme Court, for not giving school districts the power to force the transformation of white schools to multiracial. </p>
<p>Their report called &#8220;Lessons in integration&#8221; was supported by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
<p>This goes beyond renewal of the civil rights movement. They want to take rights away from people now enjoying them.</p>

		<p>   I teach &#8220;9th grade&#8221; students who have anywhere from a 3rd-to-5th grade reading level. (I&rsquo;m not a special ed teacher.) How they got to the 9th grade, I don&rsquo;t know. And I&rsquo;m supposed to &#8220;show progress&#8221; in their test results  &mdash;  pretty hard when the tests are written on the 9th grade level. <br>
   For heaven&rsquo;s sake, please look into home schooling, private schooling  &mdash;  anything to get your beautiful, smart children the education they deserve.</p>

		<p>Believe me, I live this mess everyday.  I work in a large urban school district where nearly every school is 100% non-white.  There are a few bright kids, but they are overwhelmed by the gang bangers, dimwits and you name it.  </p>
<p>The charters out here look good, but only because they keep the problem kids, special ed and english language learners at arm&rsquo;s length.  That is the entire magic behind so-called charter &#8220;success.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last two years of driving past several high schools, several middle schools and a couple of elementary schools, I saw one lonely white blond girl walking outside a high school - alone - while throngs of non-whites were gayly walking around in great clumps.  That&rsquo;s it - just one!</p>
<p>It is so funny to me, that orfield guy.  He and his ilk are always crying about integration, but they never consider any other type of integration except mixing everyone with whites.  LA and Chicago have the same problem now - there&rsquo;s so few white students left that there&rsquo;e not enough to go around to mix white students into every school.</p>
<p>Fast forward 20 years, and more than half the country will be in this position, and the next fifty years will be an ever-dwindling number of older white folks slaving away trying to provide social services, education and such for the black and brown majorities, whose children will be 80% of the kids across the country.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Civil Rights Project/ Proyecto Derechos Civiles&#8221; is co-directed by husband and wife Gary Orfield and Patricia Gándara, who moved their organization from Harvard to UCLA in 2007.</p>
<p>Orfield was a professor of education and social policy at Harvard University. He co-founded the Civil Rights Project in 1996 (with Harvard Law School professor Christopher Edley, Jr).</p>
<p>They have commissioned more than 400 reports and issued 12 books over the last 10 years. Their work was cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2003 decision upholding affirmative action in college admissions. </p>
<p>They recently coordinated the submission of a social science brief signed by 553 scholars at more than 200 institutions in 42 states in support of two cases currently before the Supreme Court, which will determine the future of voluntary integration in public schools.</p>
<p>Orfield has been professor of education and social policy at Harvard University. Gándara was professor of education at UC Davis, and a social scientist with the RAND Corp., director of education research for the California Assembly and commissioner for postsecondary education for California. </p>
<p>Now associate director for the UC Linguistic Minority Research Institute, she is the author of &#8220;Understanding the Latino Education Gap: Why Latinos Don&rsquo;t Go to College,&#8221; to be published by Harvard University Press.</p>
<p>In UCLA and Harvard, they have platforms to push a pathologically single-minded agenda: undermine white segregation. </p>
<p>The only question left to ask is why? What motivates them? </p>

		<p>Claiming that Charter Schools promote segregation is deceptive. The only thing Charter Schools promote is more freedom of choice. As opposed to traditional public schools which have undermined our freedoms through forced integration schemes. If parents want to send their children there then fine. And if parents don&rsquo;t want to send their children there then that&rsquo;s fine, too. My only objection is educrats trying to impose a social agenda on other people&rsquo;s children.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Latino and white students will attend class with fewer children who look different from themselves.&#8221; </p>
<p>Which is it:  Are Minority kids failing because they don&rsquo;t have enough people &#8220;who look like them,&#8221; or is it because they don&rsquo;t have enough people who &#8220;look different from them?&#8221;   </p>
<p>Likewise, have minorities and illegal aliens been abused because the banks did not lend them enough money to buy houses or because the banks lent them too much money (i.e., gave them predatory loans with no down-payments, and failed to confirm that they were actually employed)?</p>
<p>Also, Are whites racist because we police too aggressively in Minority neighborhoods, or are whites racists because police ignore Black neighborhoods?</p>
<p>Are Whites, Jews, Asians, and Middle Easterners racists for opening stores in Black areas and thus &#8220;taking economic advantage of Blacks,&#8221; or are we all racists for not placing stores in Black neighborhoods and thus making Blacks have to travel long distances to get to stores?</p>
<p>Are European-Americans racist because UC Berkeley is ~ 50% Asian and ~ 15% Jewish or are European-Americans racists because only ~15% of UC Berkeley is Hispanic &amp; Black, and only ~20% of UCB students are of Western European heritage?</p>
<p>Is UC Berkeley racist because it graduates nearly 3 times as many Asians and Jews as it does students of Western European heritage?  </p>
<p>Does race not exist (only a social construct) or is racial diversity our greatest strength?</p>
<p>Boy, this diversity business sure is confusing.  </p>

		<p>Why, oh why, are clusters of white students in some public schools such a threat to these people?  Are white students just pawns to be used in the futile game of attempting to bring the scores of &#8220;minority&#8221; students up &hellip;. I suppose the answer to this is yes.  God help us if these integration radicals start getting higher level court rulings to force racial integration across school district lines.</p>
<p>If the policies of these people prevail the only option for whites may well be home schooling, or private schools.</p>

		<p>Apparently AR fails to understand the purpose of Charter Schools that as mainly all black and run by all blacks who get free money from the county state and gov and discriminate against hiring whites. <br>
Charter Schools exist to help equalize the &#8220;gap&#8221; since they use softer standards and have no oversight. If these school grades were not included in the final tallys the &#8220;gap&#8221; would be much worse. </p>

		<p>I bet that the majority of whites in LA are sending their kids to private schools, so that means LAUSD&rsquo;s schools are even less white than the 9% stat suggests. (There are many neighborhood schools where there a literally less than 10 white kids in the entire school&hellip; can you imagine the hell those kids must go through?). </p>
<p>So middle class whites fortunate enough to own property get the privilege of paying for public education twice - once for their kid to go to a decent private school, and once again to pay for a latino anchor baby with illegal parents. </p>
<p>Somehow it has become  the white American middle class&rsquo; responsibility to provide literacy and a safety net for Mexico&rsquo;s poor. Sure hope that cheap illegal labor was worth it!</p>
