			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael J. Thompson, Campus Reform (Boise State University), February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Boise State&rsquo;s Cultural Center director, Ro Parker, is at the center of campus controversy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because she put a racist illustration on her Facebook profile.</p>
<p>It began when Parker posted an image on Facebook. As the Boise State campus newspaper described, it&rsquo;s an &#8220;illustration&#8221; of &#8220;two black women, one of whom is pointing a finger in the face of a white man. He is holding his hands up in a position of semi-surrender. The caption reads &#8216;shut the #### up, Whiteboy.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>(Perhaps ironically, Parker&rsquo;s goals  &mdash;  according to her BSU profile page  &mdash;  are to &#8220;plan programming that will raise awareness of marginalized groups, white privilege, identity and oppression.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The illustration was printed on handouts that were anonymously distributed across campus. Campus outcry soon followed. Student Senate President Pro Tempore Justin White explained his reaction simply: &#8220;I am siding with students. Content reflects personal opinion. Teachers get fired for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Student Erin Malor said this entire episode showcases the hypocrisy of the center&rsquo;s goals. &#8220;Most students on this campus are here for an education that will help them in the future, but it appears the Cultural Center is attempting to re-educate students. The sensible thing would be for [Ro] Parker to resign over this incident, to maintain the integrity of the Cultural Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this crisis for Boise State, one lesson is certain: cultural and diversity centers are well-funded at schools across the nation. They employ thousands, if not tens of thousands of individuals, who enforce a strict orthodoxy of political correctness, heavy on oppression and &#8220;identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the coordinator of the Cultural Center at Boise State University has posted a shocking image that should cause reflection among those who question the allocation of resources to go towards departments that serve little educational value, save for the censoring of individuals they deem not diverse.</p>
<p>Boise State University students and SGA officials are working to see that proper actions are taken to ensure that BSU doesn&rsquo;t harbor a climate for hate. Ro Parker is an employee of the state of Idaho and merely the action of posting this hurtful picture on her Facebook profile warrants immediate removal from her post as coordinator for the Cultural Center.</p>
<p>Diversity and tolerance mean inclusion for all, not just for those groups the Cultural Center deems worthy of protection.</p>

							<i>"redvoter," Campus Reform (Boise State University), February 10, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>It has recently come to my attention that hate flyers have been posted all over the campus. But that is not the true point of the blog post. The mian pt is the way the cultural and diversity center handled the issue. For a little background here around a week ago several flyers were shown around campus that showed two angry black women yelling at a white timid male and under the picture the caption read &#8220;F u white boy.&#8221; As reprehensible as this is the way the cultural center and its head has handled it is even worse. She posted the picture on her facebook page without even explaning what the picture was about and only when students complained did she come before the ASBSU and make the picture private. As expected the university is protecting her and her blatantly negligent actions and only the outcry of students actually caused her to explain her actions. Unfortunately this is not new for BSU and campuses nationwide.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Redvoter<br>

		<p>Some times, it takes one more straw to break the camel&rsquo;s back.  The disparate impact of many decades of classes, courses, seminars and cirricula at Boise State University has been to tell white men (hint:  We&rsquo;re not &#8220;boys&#8221;) to shut the f*** up.  Maybe it takes such a blatant and in-your-face presentation of that subtle message in its plain and ridiculous form to wake white people up, and to encourage them to speak the f*** up.</p>
<p>Mark Kasen, a liberal radio talker in St. Louis, thinks that &#8220;shut up&#8221; are the two ugliest words in the English language.  I happen to agree.</p>

		<p>That is the EXACT same position that  Pinky the ghetto thug and &#8220;Santa&#8221; were in before &#8220;Santa&#8221; opened up (pinky, that is)  on that Oakland bus. It now has 750,000 hits and over 20,000 comments&hellip; My own was, seeing the crowd at the bus stop part as the White guy got off yelling and the black dude stayed on, bleeding and semi concious, was&hellip; &#8220;Punish one, Teach a thousand!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Do blacks really think that is a flattering picture of black women?  </p>
<p>The picture is trying to demean white men, but it backfires on many levels.  Instead, it represents the worst traits of what many see in black women: angrer, irrational, affirmative action, double standards, racist, difficult to work with, etc.  The racist caption seals the deal.  </p>
<p>As for the white guy, he looks a little nerdy, but at least he appears to be calm and rational.</p>

		<p>The expression on Ro&rsquo;s face shows it all - smarmy, smart-aleck, and laughing in the faces of all whites that she got away with a racist post, and also laughing because there&rsquo;s nothing the whites can do about it.  I think white tolerance is reaching a critical mass here&hellip;..</p>

		<p>It is a funny picture. The best would be to produce the switcheroo of it, ( white women, black boy) and then let the liberals make them take both down. It is actually better to endorse free speech i think.</p>
<p>But maybe just attack the free speech of the peopel who regulate speech?<br>

		<p>This story exposes what&rsquo;s really going on under the surface of the &#8220;multicultural agenda&#8221; - it&rsquo;s what most snowjobbed white libs don&rsquo;t seem to get:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about equal opportunity, it&rsquo;s not about leveling the playing field, it&rsquo;s not about addressing the injustices of the past, it&rsquo;s not about celebrating all diverse cultures and ethnicities - and the goal is not a future where everyone of all races and ethnicities get along beautifully.</p>
<p>They hate whites, especially white males. They teach this hate in their families. You don&rsquo;t have to look hard for the hate - just pay close attention to street-level black and latino culture - their hate for whites is right out in the open, unashamed and self-righteous. </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to merely live alongside us. They want what we have and they are willing to take it from us. They are quite willing to race replace us right out of existence through immigration, miscegenation and if they can, legal discrimination. The future they want is one of ongoing racial and ethnic struggle where each group scratches, claws and grabs for every little crumb that falls from the table. Our loss is their gain.</p>
<p>Anti-racism, multiculturalism, diversity - they&rsquo;re all code words for an anti-white agenda.</p>

		<p>Welcome to modern academia my friends. This kind of stuff is not new nor is it an isolated incident. Every public university in this nation employs at least one person like Ro Parker. The &#8220;cultural centers&#8221; are staffed excusively by her ilk&hellip;and they are seething with race-based hate. This is what your tax dollars pay for. This is what your children will be subjected to when you send them to college.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s (the picture) is posted as a joke, but just today I watched a video, posted on another chat site (posted as a joke there also) but it did appeared to be a real video - it showed two young black women walking past two elderly white women, 70 to 80 years old, at what appeared to be an airport terminal or a bus station. One of the black women approaches one of the white women from the side and punches her in the face and then they walk away &#8216;job well done&rsquo;. It was posted as a comedy piece. </p>

		<p>Hey #3, I reaped immense satisfaction from that video. It&rsquo;s nice to see a white person finally stand up for himself against individual black aggressors. Perhaps this will serve as a warning for all rowdy blacks. </p>
<p>Also, I am so sick and tired of &#8220;white boy.&#8221; Even middle aged white men are referred to as &#8220;white boy.&#8221; However, you can never call a 17 year old black boy &#8220;black boy.&#8221; No, that would evoke the horrible legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, since all black men were called boy. I guess they&rsquo;re now trying to play a little game of role reversal. Now, all white men are &#8220;white boys&#8221; while all black males are &#8220;black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>History shows us that no &#8220;oppressed group&#8221; really wants equality, but special privileges of their own. The only reason why blacks and anti-racists spew so much anti-white garbage is because they know they live in a tolerant and open nation. If all whites were to all of a sudden come together and cultivate a don&rsquo;t-mess-with-me attitude like Epic Beard Man from the Oakland bus fight, then anti-white hate merchants wouldn&rsquo;t be so bold. </p>

		<p>Being an ex sailor my attitudes toward race mixing are a bit ambivalent. What happens outside the three mile limit is nobody`s concern especially wives, preachers, and parents. Is Boise outside the three mile limit? That chick was really hot and the ladies in the picture were smoking also. I know old men who would pay good money to have two black vixens yell at them.<br>
     We should follow Redd Foxx`s rule #1. When the lights go off, the ony thing that matters is who took the last bath. The white man`s burden was heavy,but somebody had to carry it 40 years ago. It is time all Amreners quit making bogeymen out of our racial enemies and started to make fun of them. A good Yankee liberal would much rather be shot at than laughed at.<br>

		<p> Actually I see grear fear and hope for whites in the poster. I&rsquo;ve been in exactly the position of the white guy when I was making a point and the black teacher tried to bully me down and shut me up since people in the course were in danger of agreeing with my point. There is a drumbeat of resistance to political correctness from poor whites who are the most damaged by anti-white bigotry even if they hold a pure equality position and have the nerve and ability to argue the point. After I had my polite (I was unquestionably polite.) The white kids came up to me and said quietly that they agreed with my point.lol</p>

		<p>Actually this poster made me chuckle wondering what this White guy said to make that woman say that.  Did he comment on her frequent absenteeism or tardiness?  Her substandard work or her brassy attitude towards fellow co-workers?  Was it her bad grammar?  I get the impression the other woman is there to act as a collaborating witness to any grievance filed to the EEOC.  It&rsquo;s obvious this poster is dated, maybe from two different eras.  The Angela Davis afro puts it somewhere in the 1970s but the second woman looks like she was photoshopped from a 1990s black sitcom.  Both are very unattractive.</p>

		<p>Hey #3, that Oakland Bus Fight video is priceless! I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be hearing more of it here. Sounds like the thug&rsquo;s female cameraperson friend tried to steal &#8220;Santa&rsquo;s&#8221; bag as well.</p>
<p>Punish one, Teach a thousand?! C&rsquo;mon, now. Ever try to teach a black male anything? Heck, we need to punish several thousand this way. Not that they&rsquo;ll ever learn.</p>
<p>Gotta love the video age and instant communications. Whites are FINALLY catching on to the reality of black behavior, and beginning to fight back without guilt&hellip; when not outnumbered fifty-to-one anyway.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something peculiar about the first woman&rsquo;s left hand.  It seems to be superimposed over &#8220;Foxy Brown&rsquo;s&#8221; body.  Her pantsuit seems to be out of place with all the retro imagery in the poster like the afro, the clock and the White guy&rsquo;s hairstyle.</p>
