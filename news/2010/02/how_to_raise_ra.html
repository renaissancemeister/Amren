	<p>Step One: Don&rsquo;t talk about race. Don&rsquo;t point out skin color. Be &#8220;color blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Step Two: Actually, that&rsquo;s it. There is no Step Two.</p>
<p>Congratulations! Your children are well on their way to believing that <insert your ethnicity here> is better than everybody else.</p>
<p>Surprised? So were authors Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman when they started researching the issue of kids and race for their book NurtureShock. It turns out that a lot of our assumptions about raising our kids to appreciate diversity are entirely wrong:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tempting to believe that because their generation is so diverse, today&rsquo;s children grow up knowing how to get along with people of every race. But numerous studies suggest that this is more of a fantasy than a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} What Bronson and Merryman discovered, through various studies, was that most white parents don&rsquo;t ever talk to their kids about race. The attitude (at least of those who think racism is wrong) is generally that because we want our kids to be color-blind, we don&rsquo;t point out skin color. We&rsquo;ll say things like &#8220;everybody&rsquo;s equal&#8221; but find it hard to be more specific than that. If our kids point out somebody who looks different, we shush them and tell them it&rsquo;s rude to talk about it. We think that simply putting our kids in a diverse environment will teach them that diversity is natural and good.</p>
<p>And what are they learning? Here are a few depressing facts:</p>
<p>* Only 8% of white American high-schoolers have a best friend of another race. (For blacks, it&rsquo;s about 15%.)</p>
<p>* The more diverse a school is, the less likely it is that kids will form cross-race friendships.</p>
<p>* 75% of white parents never or almost never talk about race with their kids.</p>
<p>* A child&rsquo;s attitudes toward race are much harder to alter after third grade, but a lot of parents wait until then (or later) before they feel it&rsquo;s &#8220;safe&#8221; to talk frankly about race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, in honor of Black History Month, talk to your kids about race. Need some help? Parenting.com recently posted 5 Tips for Talking About Racism With Kids. {snip}<br>

		<p>In other words, Patterson&rsquo;s First Axiom has been proven correct.  Integration is self-defeating.  </p>
<p>I think the use of &#8220;third grade&#8221; as a crossover point in race relations is significant.  Before then, children are just children, but there&rsquo;s something about the age of 9 or 10 that children of all races start to become racially aware.  One thing we know happens at that age is that previously rapid brain development in blacks slows down, and whites, who were on average behind blacks until that age, continue brain development, all as a measure of central tendency.  </p>

		<p>From the Tips-</p>
<p>Accept that prejudiced comments may happen   &mdash;   and that doesn&rsquo;t mean your child is racist. If your kid makes a questionable remark, don&rsquo;t freak. &#8220;Children often repeat what they hear others say, and it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the child believes it,&#8221; says Dr. Tatum. &#8220;Ask questions. &#8216;What made you say&hellip;.?&rsquo; Gently dispute the stereotype or prejudiced attitudes. &#8216;I&rsquo;ve heard people say X about Y, but my experience with Y people is&hellip;&rsquo; and give an example to dispute the stereotype.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Will these liberal white parents tell their white children that &#8220;we need to move to a black neighborhood so you won&rsquo;t be a racist&#8221; &#8220;don&rsquo;t ever listen to anyone who starts talking about the Zebra Murders, Witchita Massacre, Knoxville Horror, Julie Love, Eve Carson, Anne Pressley, or any other savage, brutal murder of whites by blacks&#8221; &#8220;Martin Luther King and Barak Obama are the most truly American leaders in our history&#8221;</p>

		<p>You have to love the stupidity in this article. A few gems:</p>
<p><i>We think that simply putting our kids in a diverse environment will teach them that diversity is natural and good.</i></p>
<p>Oh, but of course. If we put Junior someplace, a school let&rsquo;s say, where he can witness firsthand the unruly behavior, low intelligence and hyper-emotional/violent tendencies of his &#8220;diverse&#8221; classmates, he&rsquo;ll just <i>have</i> to see the inherent goodness of it all.</p>
<p>And obviously, all these different races being coerced into close proximity, when left to their own devices they would separate like oil and water, will seem perfectly natural.</p>
<p><i>The more diverse a school is, the less likely it is that kids will form cross-race friendships.</i></p>
<p>You mean people will gravitate to their own? I&rsquo;m shocked!</p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s really tough to be good friends with the kids who are threatening/attacking/taking your lunch money everyday. </p>
<p><i>75% of white parents never or almost never talk about race with their kids.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re afraid to tell them the truth, and don&rsquo;t have the heart to lie to them the way this writer wants.</p>
<p>Seriously, I will never understand the confusion some people feel upon witnessing the plainly obvious.</p>

<p>Translation:</p>
<p>&#8216;We desperately wanted to believe that we could eliminate &#8216;racism&rsquo;. After all, we KNOW no one is born a racist so racism HAS to be learned. What we failed to see is that there&rsquo;s a natural and innate drive in human beings to see race and made decisions about what they see. We&rsquo;re going to have to re-double our efforts to make children understand that any observations about race are really a mental defect and moral failing.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>* The more diverse a school is, the less likely it is that kids will form cross-race friendships.</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written this many times. I was never taught &#8216;racism&rsquo; or to &#8216;hate&rsquo; anyone for any reason. I passively believed that all people were the same. But as I grew up and had increasing contact with other people of other races, I clearly saw that racial stereotypes existed for a reason; they were true.</p>
<p>It was my experience with people of different races that taught me the validity of race. Telling me that my experiences and observations are invalid doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the truth.</p>
<p>Race is real.<br>

<p>This is their most important finding! You can easily replace school with &#8216;society&rsquo;, &#8216;nation&rsquo;, institution&rsquo;. The more diverse any social grouping is the less trust among members and the greater tendency toward tribalism. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The attitude (at least of those who think racism is wrong) is generally that because we want our kids to be color-blind, we don&rsquo;t point out skin color. We&rsquo;ll say things like &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s equal&rdquo; but find it hard to be more specific than that&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because any white who says anything beyond that (and sometimes those who only say just that - or even those saying good things about non-whites) will be punished in the media as being a representative sample of racism. Whites are considered bad or in a negative context. Conversely, any non-white talking about race in almost any context is considered a living breathing example of diversity. Perhaps I should say &#8216;holy diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Interesting, I knew a black woman who claimed when black boys turn 10 years old or so something (bad) happens to them. I think I could agree with the third-grade thing in the article. That&rsquo;s how I was when I was young, and today I think of racists, &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo; as dumb. At the same time not noticing reality is even dumber. Being dumb has become mandatory. </p>

		<p>Let me get this straight, living in a simmering multiracial stew, ah, I mean melting pot, isn&rsquo;t good enough. We now have to go out of our way to teach children that what they observe by interacting with other races isn&rsquo;t good enough. They may actually see those races for what they are. It is now incumbent for us to teach our children that racism is a no no, and that they should go out of the way to believe we are all the same no matter what we see with our own eyes, or what our personal experiences show us.</p>
<p>I would rather believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus than try to convince myself or someone else that all races are created equal. In fact, the tooth fairy and Santa Claus are more plausible than all that equality nonsense.</p>

<p>As a practical matter the races should never be integrated.  It&rsquo;s unhealthy, and it is solidly against the dictates of human nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing the truth of that right now.  We don&rsquo;t really need a study.  </p>

		<p>This is old news.  Everyone from Steven Pinker to school psychologists know that children are naturally tribal and chauvinistic.  (As first-grader, I remember looking down on kids who didn&rsquo;t shop at the same store my mommy did.  If my mommy shopped at Safeway, then anyone who shopped at Giant was obviously a loser&hellip;)</p>
<p>The song from &#8220;South Pacific&#8221; that goes, &#8220;You have to be taught how to hate, by 6,7 or 8&hellip;&#8221; is absolutely backwards.  That&rsquo;s why public schools drill &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221; from kindergarten on up!</p>
<p>If simply &#8220;not teaching&#8221; hate were the answer, we would not need a cradle-to-grave diversity-promotion industry.</p>

		<p>Mommy, what is the NAACP?</p>
<p>Why, it is a wonderful community organization that helps people of color access the American promise and overcome the lingering effects white bigotry and racism.</p>
<p>But Mommy, we are white. Are we racists?</p>
<p>Well, some white people are racists, because they don&rsquo;t like people of color. But we aren&rsquo;t like them, because our best friends are diverse and African American.</p>
<p>But Mommy, does the American promise apply to us, we who are non colored but are white? Do we have a community organization for us called the National Association of Non-Colored People?</p>
<p>Honey, I think you are confused. We are Americans, and we don&rsquo;t need to think about our color. As good Americans, we are supposed to foster diversity and help minorities.</p>
<p>But Mommy&hellip;.</p>
<p>Hush now, darling, you don&rsquo;t want to start sounding like a racist by asking all these questions, now do you?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity 4 makes an interesting point. I believe something does happen among children at around age 9-10, after which they begin to notice behavioral differences, especially between blacks and whites.  Previously well behaved black children become clownish, disruptive, and begin to fall behind academically.  Shortly thereafter some become violent, or at least threatening to the white children.  </p>
<p>I observed this personally over fifty years ago in the public school system of an upscale northern New Jersey community. I never gave it much thought at the time but now believe it to be normal developmentally for blacks.</p>

		<p>In the schools I&rsquo;ve worked in (100% non-white in one combination or another) a few blacks and hispanics will be friends, but the majority do not like each other much.  Why don&rsquo;t the social justice, diversity do-gooders tackle that obvious racism between those two groups?  That would get them off our backs.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that it has been over 20 years since I have seen or interacted with any white students.  I don&rsquo;t even remember what they&rsquo;re like!  I do recall from my own school days growing up in an all white town that there was a general level of good behavior among the student body in general.  Yes, there would be bullies, burnouts and the occassional fight, but those were not the norm.  In my 100% black and latino classrooms and hallways, it is the opposite.</p>

		<p>Race &amp; religion have this in common: People believe what they want to believe.  Reality can influence a person&rsquo;s beliefs, but it&rsquo;s usually gradual.  For some the process of bringing their beliefs into line with reality can be excruciating. </p>
<p>When I meet &#8220;non-racists&#8221; I always wish I could get them drunk enough to admit that they are, underneath all that liberal talk, far more racist than I am on my worst day.  <br>

<p>Golly.  Maybe the premise that diversity is something to appreciate needs examining.  Maybe diversity is something we could get along fine without, and was imposed upon us by our government and media overlords?  Not even liberal rich people appreciate diversity, especially if they have school age children.  They always move into the kind of lily white neighborhood I wish I could afford to move to.<br>

<p>Ahh, the old &#8220;let&rsquo;s pretend all other things are equal&#8221; fallacy. They always trot out that one regarding the plurality of white welfare recipients, utterly disregarding whites&rsquo; proportion of the population.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that whites in America outnumber blacks by something like five to one, what the above statistic actually demonstrates is that whites are more disposed to having a &#8220;best friend of another race&#8221; than blacks.</p>
<p>Taking into account the sorry state of American education, it&rsquo;s likely that only 8% of students of any color would be able to figure that out, though.</p>

		<p>I went to a high school that prided itself on diversity (Ferndale High, Ferndale, Michigan).  They even had flags in the commons representing what nationalities students were.  This is a Detroit suburb, so you have lots of Muslims and Jews in the area.  Hamtramck used to be Polish (I think that&rsquo;s where my mother met my birth father).  There was a nice girl from Libya in one of my English classes, and a nice, quiet, Iraqi boy in my honors English class.  My best friend in high school was Jewish.</p>
<p>Yet students still self-segregated.  Blacks hung out with each other.  Most of the Arab students had their own corner of the commons to hang out in during lunch.</p>
<p>I knew of only one interracial couple (black/white) and I graduated in 1991.</p>

		<p>Right after the civil rights revolution, it was plausible to believe that blacks had been so held back in the U.S. that they could not compete with whites on a large scale.  Now, a half century later, it&rsquo;s no longer plausible to believe that bigotry and segregation are to blame.  Yet, the loony left continues to push the same old arguments because there&rsquo;s nothing left to blame but genetics.  And I would bet that only the very young and naive truly believe the leftist spin.<br>

		<p>WHY? Why on earth would a White person WANT a non-White &#8220;best friend.&#8221; The idea is a contradiction in terms. The one good thing about that all-prevalent violence against White kids in schools, by Blacks&hellip; is that it instills anti-Black sentiments in Whites. How does that saw go again? &#8220;A Conservative is a Liberal who just got mugged?&#8221; A whole universe of truth in that sentence.</p>

		<p>The answer to why is there not a White History Month question posed by one reader&hellip; Because it would take YEARS to list and itemize achivements by Whites! Black History is a myth and an invention. The Africans really do not have much history predating 1865 to brag about.</p>
<p>Those ridiculous claims for great civilizations in ancient Africa are a good joke. Along with frenzied claims by Blacks those Egyptians who&rsquo;s talent left us the Great Pyramids, being primarily of Nubian descent.</p>
<p>We keep hearing about Blacks invented the fountain pen and traffic lights. Which can also be said Black inventors had simply submitted their patent applications FIRST. What really cracks me up with the fountain pen/traffic light claims&hellip; Had WRITING and AUTOMOBILES not been invented there would have been no need of either. What little original invention by non-Whites was achieved, still rests on thousands of years of thinking, study, research and experimentation by Europeans (Whites) and later in America. Funny how Blacks never point that out in their endless claims they make for themselves. </p>

		<p>What should the talk about race be? There is no such thing as race. We are all the same. The so-called racial differences are no more than the differences in hair color, height, weight, or any number of things that make each one of us unique. When I went to high school I never had a best friend that was fat, or had blond hair. Am I an obesist, or an anti-blondist? The people that whine about racism are the people that say there is no such thing as race. Can&rsquo;t have it both ways. The fact is if children are not instructed to ignore racial differences and believe that all races are equal they will naturally develop to have racial pride and see others as different because they ARE different.  </p>

		<p>I watched the video posted by icemale 26# Interesting&hellip;For one thing I couldn&rsquo;t understand the dialogue very well but got the gist of it. The good thing was..here was a white man that wasn&rsquo;t afraid or bullied by blacks. The black guy seemed over emotional but not inherently malicious. The black guy got his self kicked and I think he needed the education. But most of all what I get out of this&hellip;. Is sadness&hellip; this is a breakdown of being human. All people regardless of racial type ought to honor their own self. Human beings have all the primordial animal instincts&hellip;But..we are more than animals* No one should Ever look down on any human being because he shines shoes or does any honorable job regardless of humble position .. as I see it, And no one should ever look down on himself regardless of any supposed reason as long as he knows he labors honorably. Individuals and subgroups of people are different and add to the richness of life&hellip;these qualities are not the enemies of peace&hellip; as I think the left believes. I think a thicker skin for those that feel lower on the totem pole is a good start. Who dishonors himself dishonors the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;So, in honor of Black History Month, talk to your kids about race&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Good Idea. </p>
<p>Just make sure you lay out the truth to your children lest they end up like Eve Carson or the Gentry family of Pearcy, Arkansas.  Didn&rsquo;t read about it in the newspapers or see it on CNN?  Well, neither did anyone else and if it weren&rsquo;t for the Internet, I wouldn&rsquo;t know about it either as the MSM refuse to report black-on-White crimes:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yd36wpl</p>
<p>I am one of the 25% of parents that talk to their kids about race  &mdash;  I would be a negligent parent if I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I tell my beautiful 19-year old daughter to avoid black men at all costs using these statistics from the FBI:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Every year there are about 15,000 black-on-white rapes but fewer than 900 white-on-black rapes. There are more than 3,000 gang rapes of whites by blacks &mdash; but white-on-black gang rapes are so rare they do not even show up in the statistics&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Any parent that doesn&rsquo;t warn their White children, their White daughters, that they are targeted for murder, rapes, robberies by blacks is not doing their job as a parent to protect their precious children from danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Better to be accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo; than to sit in court like Eve Carson&rsquo;s, Channon Christian, Christopher Newsom&rsquo;s and the Gentry family&rsquo;s loved ones watching lawyers desperately trying to free the black murderers of YOUR children, blaming &#8216;racism&rsquo; as the excuse.</p>
<p>Yes, parents do your job!  Teach your children well about the dangers of the world  &mdash;  and don&rsquo;t leave out the extreme danger they face from blacks who wish to rape, rob and murder them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard my dad use the n-word infrequently after I was out of high school. I don&rsquo;t like to use it. It makes me sound stupid, even if that&rsquo;s how I feel about them sometimes. </p>
<p>No diversity training needed for anyone. Differing ethnicities will weed themselves out naturally as appropriate. </p>

		<p>What &#8220;WbuMongo&#8221; is interesting but flawed reasoning.</p>
<p>There are differences among races that transcend skin tone and general physical differences. It&rsquo;s that subtle difference in mentality discernible in non-White races that often arouses racial feelings. Like the perception that members of non-White races are far more likely to come from a racial group of non- or at best, under-achievers. That members of non-White races are more likely to be parasites, fastening themselves on White nations as legal or even illegal immigrants. Then expecting in many cases, life-long support by the White taxpayers as welfare or other forms of government subsistance.</p>
<p>Put it this way: Assuming that ALL races were truly equal, it would have been only reasonable that ALL races would have developed at the same rate. That inventions made in Europe since the dawn of Rennaissance would have been mirrored or echoed by every racial group around the globe. Something which emphatically was NOT the case.</p>
<p>White Europeans led the world in attainment of real civilization and the knowledge, learning, science and technical and medical advances we enjoy today. Orientals came in a distant second. Africans very far behind. Despite the myth we call &#8220;Black History.&#8221; Where, one might ask, is the evidence supporting the frenzied claims for Black accomplishments in Africa BEFORE White Europeans started colonizing the Dark Continent? If Blacks were such truly advanced peoples as they&rsquo;d want us to believe, why was this knowledge suppressed or hidden? Why did Europeans have a free hand in seizing the lands from the Blacks? The reality is technology Europeans possessed made it possible to carve out their colonies. Without any real resistance. The belief that Africans were little more than squabbling tribes seems well supported by history. Signs of vast technological and scientific lore amassed by Africans being non-existent.</p>

<p>They certainly do have it both ways. Affirmative action while saying it is whites who are evil and discriminate. White racial identity is bad, while every other race should be as race conscious (as racist) as it is possible to make them. Then begin the celebration. </p>

<p>Certainly there are the culture arguments, which we can squarely blame on the actions of the left. Which is a nice and tidy way to say the left are responsible for the very ailments they most vehemently rail against. Anyone just a bit observant and over 50 years of age, would have to look at the West before 1960 and then again after, and wonder if there&rsquo;s a bit of truth in that. But not a tried and true liberal, and certainly not a young one. For them it&rsquo;s a matter of redoubling the effort. </p>

<p>The are elitists, who want to construct with a peer group non-white elitists to associate with - this is their grand global agenda. Obama was a product of that agenda.</p>
<p>They want to diversify the underclass, while they maintain the class structure they look down from. In other words, equality for them is whites uncomplainingly doing their menial tasks for below-poverty wages, alongside the Third World imports.   </p>

		<p> Every white parent should sit down with their kids and tell them the facts of life about race. They should tell them that people the world over want to live among their own kind and that diversity is not natural and never works anywhere. Also that non whites tend to be violent. Also must tell them about all the inventions white people made. Also tell them the white race is the most beautiful looking race. Tell them that the white race is only 8 to 9% of the world&rsquo;s population and that they must not intermarry and have non white children. They must have lots of white children so their race won&rsquo;t disappear. If the parents do this job right no commie professor will change their minds.</p>

		<p>My children developed race realist views by 2nd grade without so much as a peep outta me. They notice that the black and Hispanic kids are slow learners, the black boys frequently make sexual comments to non-black girls, and whereas whites and Asians can be friends, blacks and Hispanics exclusively hang around their own, except when they are hustling whites for lunch money.</p>

		<p>Another way to teach your kids to be racist, is to blame them for all the world&rsquo;s problems, tell them they are inherently oppressive, that all the faults of non-whites is their responsibility, and that any resistance of ANY non-white bigotry or uncivilized or mean behavior is &#8216;racism.&rsquo;  Oh, tell them it&rsquo;s racist not to support non-whites at the expense of their own race.  Tell them they&rsquo;re racist to be more concerned about their own job and family than 12% of the popluation who hate them and want to kill them all if given the chance.</p>

		<p>The reason that parents wait till the kids are 10 is that children have the unpleasant habit of telling everything that they know, and much of what they don&rsquo;t, and then when they tell their classmates that &#8220;Mommy said that black people aren&rsquo;t like us&#8221;, someone denounces her to child protective services and then there are lots of problems.</p>
