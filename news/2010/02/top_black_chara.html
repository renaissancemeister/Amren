<h1><a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/02/top-ten-african-american-characters-in-sci-fi/">Top Black Characters in Science Fiction</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lonnie Morgan, Wired, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} I can imagine a date in the future, when we refer to each other as Terran (as opposed to Martian or Titanese) or even just human.</p>
<p>Over my lifetime, a few movies and TV shows have got it right by casting a black actor in a particular role, not to get a stereotype on the screen, but because the actor or actress was the right fit for the part; they were the embodiment of the character.</p>
<p>The character was not a slang-talking, gangsta-riding jokester with a background in the &#8216;hood. Not a sex kitten or ultra-pro-black (or as David Alan Grier says, &#8220;Mike Tyson black&#8221;), holding the gun sideways. Not a drug-dealing, pimping, dancing and jiving stereotype. They were just another excellent player in said show or movie. They made us forget about race as a divisive issue.</p>
<p>So, in recognition of the first day of Black History Month, here is a list of my top 10 favorite African American sci-fi movie &amp; TV characters of all time.</p>
<p>1. Ben Hanser, Night of the Living Dead, played by Duane Jones: One of the first black hero characters in a mostly-white movie? Maybe, but I am not a movie expert. Duane Jones showed us all how to take out a zombie or two.</p>
<p>2. Lornette &#8220;Mace&#8221; Mason, Strange Days, played by Angela Bassett: {snip}</p>
<p>3. Benjamin Sisko, DS9, played by Avery Brooks: Running for six years in the &rsquo;90s, Star Trek: DS9 was a great entry into the canon. And Avery Brooks owned the role of the space station commander. While most geek folk remember Avery for DS9, I still like the Hawk character better.</p>
<p>4. Geordi La Forge, Star Trek: The Next Generation, played by Levar Burton: {snip}</p>
<p>5. Lando Calrissian, Star Wars, played by Billy Dee Williams: {snip}</p>
<p>6. Sgt. Apone, Aliens, played by Al Matthews: While the tough-as-nails black sergeant is a running stereotype in Hollywood, Al Matthews was great in Aliens. Just wish he would have cracked a few more alien heads before being taken out in that tunnel.</p>
<p>7. Morpheus, The Matrix, played by Lawrence Fishburne: {snip}</p>
<p>8. Lt. Uhura, Star Trek, played by Nichelle Nichols: The queen. While her role was limited in most episodes, Nichelle Nichols was a fixture on the Star Trek bridge. Because of her casting, many more opportunities opened up for black actors. And that kiss was controversial for its time.</p>
<p>9. Lt. Vanessa Damphousse, Space: Above &amp; Beyond, played by Lanei Chapman: {snip}</p>
<p>10. Mace Windu, Star Wars, played by Samuel Jackson: {snip}</p>

		<p>So Morgan wants us to &#8220;forget about race as a divisive issue&#8221; while explicitly calling attention to the blackness of the characters he lists. Oh and he promotes Black History Month along the way. These people aren&rsquo;t very hard to figure out. </p>

<p>All these roles were, in all probability, created by Whites to continue the fantasy world where Blacks are just the same as Whites &hellip; and they love us!</p>
<p>Yes, they love us! Pure fantasy. </p>
<p>Fantasy can be entertaining, and instructive. Perhaps it kept our ancestors going  &mdash;   as they endured the bitter winters, with many dead, many sick, and spring so far away, the return of  new life a promise seemingly in the realm of fantasy. </p>

Black characters created by what I&rsquo;m going to assume are mostly (if not all) white writers. In most cases, the characters could have been white without impacting the story. </p>
<p>If blacks want to make a true and lasting impact on science fiction, black writers need to be creating viable black characters that stand on their own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are a few black scifi writers but as yet, these writers haven&rsquo;t developed novels and characters that have matched what white scifi writers have produced. If they had, Hollywood would have been making their works into films that rivaled Star Wars or 2001: A Space Odyssey (though it&rsquo;s difficult for me to believe anyone could top 2001. Star Wars maybe, but not 2001).<br>

<p>He took out a couple white guys in the movie too. As a Sci Fi fan, I appreciate the list. Two of these production I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Not to be a big jerk&hellip; but I notice in Star Wars, after the movie became a huge hit, they put the character &#8216;Lando&rsquo; in the next movie. Same with the Matrix, too. The sequels to the smash hit were considerably darker. They weren&rsquo;t nearly as good either.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know of a single black that likes science fiction movies or comic books.  Certainly not a black soul in the world reads books of science fiction.  I&rsquo;m positive they don&rsquo;t understand the concepts involved.</p>
<p>I notice that the Sci-Fi channel on T.V. has oodles of black characters all the time.  The reason for this has to be that the producers or the writers are multicult types who put their political beliefs ahead of entertainment, as does Hollywood.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Hollywood has depicted the OPPOSITE OF REALITY so many times involving blacks I refuse to watch a movie where a black is one of the main characters.</p>

		<p>Lt. Uhura may not have done much in most episodes, but she really kicked rear in that savage parallel universe. (Of course, having an ankle knife helped. Three cheers for open carry!) She, LaForge and Sisko advanced strictly on merit, which is great. An affirmative action-riddled Starfleet, OTOH, would never have gotten off the ground   &mdash;   warp cores would have breached left and right. </p>
<p>While Mace Windu was a decent Jedi master, Samuel L. Jackson went over to the dark side long ago.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> in years, but offhand I don&rsquo;t recall <i>any</i> black zombies.</p>

		<p>In most of the movies mentioned, of which I saw many, I always thought the black characters were out of place.  On Deep space 9, for example, the deep voice and frequent &#8216;black&rsquo; poses of the station commander always struck me as culturally different from those around him.  Perhaps the only SF movies I&rsquo;ve seen where the black characters seemed to transcend race were Serenity (which grew out of the Firefly series) and Lando Calrission of Star Wars.</p>

		<p>It is fascinating to observe someone express a fondness for Black characters in science fiction shows that are set hundreds of years in the future.  After all, if people continue to embrace the interbreeding propaganda forced upon them in every media, educational, governmental, and religious venue, in 300 years there won&rsquo;t BE any Black people.</p>
<p>Nothing shows pride in your race like working overtime to help wipe it out through interbreeding.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that Lawrence Fishburne also portrayed the captain of the starship USS Clark, in Event Horizon.</p>
<p>And Angela Basset also was in Supernova (as the ship&rsquo;s doctor) and in Contact, with Jodie Foster.</p>
<p>In the late seventies, the original Battlestar Galactica was pretty color-blind, with Herbert Jefferson Jr and Terry Carter as Boomer and Colonel Tigh, respectively.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, was the late Richard Biggs, as Babylon 5&rsquo;s Dr Stephen Franklin.</p>

There was a Black Jim West, utterly ridiculous under the original concept because Jim West was hired into the secret service under one of the Grant administrations. Did he get his training on the plantation? Then, Dr. Dolittle turned Black and the Nutty Professor turned Black&hellip;See a trend here?</p>

		<p>If you interact with real Black people more than a few times in your life, these characters will stand out in stark contrast to reality.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, if real Blacks were anything like the super smart, cool, calm and collected character #4 Geordi La Forge (Levar Burton), no one would be talking about their stupidity or impulsive behavior.</p>
<p>These characters are propaganda for the White masses who have no practical experience with more than a handful of Blacks.</p>
<p>It is all make up and script writers pressing an agenda on the public that they would not naturally go along with.</p>

		<p>I just came from a Sci-fi convention. I saw a few blacks, mostly accompanied by their white friends.<br>
   Duane Jones was the only one on the list that I thought was exceptional. I liked Geordi, but objected to the glasses. In a few centuries, they could probably use DNA to regenerate his eyes. Most likely up your insurance rates.<br>
    I got the DVD of the first series. I watched the episodes in the order they were broadcast. I noted that in the first season, they had a rotating characters as communications officer. In one ep, they had a well stacked blond named Elizabeth Banks (Not the modern day actress.) She would been the one I would have wanted on the comm!</p>

		<p>Duane Jones? Duane Jones?? That black character was a fool and a bully. His hare-brained attempt at a getaway got two White people killed. Later he coldly shoots and kills an unarmed White man. Finally he hypocritically does the very thing that White guy had advised all movie long and he had so ardently opposed; he goes and safely locks himself in the cellar. If this guy is a black &#8220;hero&#8221;, I&rsquo;ll take my chances with any black gangbanger instead, any day of the week. Incidentally I love sci-fi and often attend the conventions. I almost never see any blacks there at all.</p>

<p>I knew this black person that once referred to whites as &#8216;Klingons&rsquo; while talking on the phone to their friend. That was when it hit me. The &#8216;Klingons&rsquo; on the show don&rsquo;t represent white people, they represent black folks, in a small way. The idea may have always been there but just never put into words. As a star trek fan I suspect there&rsquo;s some truth in that. </p>

<p>As usual, the black guy in the &#8220;Living Dead&#8221; was the only one that knew what to do when all the whitey collapsed and fell apart!!</p>
<p>When it comes to smacking heads open, the black man knows what to do.</p>

<p>If I had to guess I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s designed to promote acceptance of disabled (especially blind) people.  The so called New World Order knows that the more they can convince the people to accept degeneracy, the easier they will be to control.  TV is one way to get them to accept it.</p>
<p>There is an episode of Star Trek:TNG where Geordi and a romulan rival are stranded in a cave and have to work together to stay alive.  The tolerance message gets blatant toward the end where Geordi says something like &#8220;Amazing, and I would have been killed in your society for being blind but here I am saving your life.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I used to like the Star Trek franchise until I really starting understanding the messages they were putting out.  Apparently Christianity has died out in this fictional universe and there is no such thing as morality with each culture adhering to different norms.  Inter-species unions are common which begs the question as to whether people can shack up with their favorite zoo animal and no one would blink an eye.  When you look at the original Star Trek, Dr McCoy, Chekov and Scotty were the only  White regular cast members surrounded by a sea of color.</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt that Avery Brooks will ever be asked to do a motion picture version of DS9.  The show was totally forgettable.  In fact it seems to me that the whole Star Trek franchise is coming to an end.  CDR Data was destroyed in the &#8220;Star Trek Insurrection&#8221; and it didn&rsquo;t generate any fanfare the way Spock did when he was killed in the second movie installment.  No one seemed to care.  Let&rsquo;s have a more realistic space exploration show that doesn&rsquo;t revolve around multicult themes.  One where they come into contact with aliens that use them as a food source or they get exposed to some sort of disease that devastates the Earth.  <br>

<p>They are totally oblivious to skin color [they cannot see] and are impervious to the racism of those that can see [usually whitey]. Paragons of racial virtue we must all emulate.</p>
<p>There was some movie was it with Sidney Poitier where he had a female white co-star who could not see? She of course thought he was so wonderful a man, not even knowing his skin color. The message is that if she could see she might not feel the same way toward Sidney.</p>

<p>Jim West was a Buffalo soldier who fought in a black regiment during the Civil War. And the idea was to hire a black man as a spy because so few would suspect him.</p>

<p>The conversation (from the smart people) was about Why did the producers cast Geordi as a blind person. Then there was all this hand wringing about &#8216;not enough strong virile black male characters&rsquo; presented on TV or something. I guess they wanted to see muscles and tattoos and not intelligence. That must be the mindset.   <br>

<p>What are you smoking? The black guy in the living dead film was no &#8220;hero&#8221;. He got just about everyone around him killed, was a bully and everything he said was wrong.  Had the &#8220;evil&#8221; White guy in the film been listened too, they all would have retreated to the cellar and been safe. Which is EXACTLY what the black &#8220;hero&#8221; did AFTER he got everybody killed with his stupidity. </p>

		<p>Well,obviously a few &#8220;Trekkies&#8221; out there like myself.And yes,I loved DS((Dominion,JemHadar,Cardassians etal)and Cmdr.sisko was an ecellent character as he DIDN&rsquo;T emphasized Africaness/blackness but was professional,couteous,strong,and competent:good traits in any man.Also according to Roddenberry the 3 major powers of that time (Federation,Klingons&Romulans;)were based on his own times Cold War adversries(America/NATO,Russia/Soviet Union,&China;)But Roddenberry couldn&rsquo;t have forseen the chaos that the 1960&rsquo;s political,social&racial; &#8220;equalization&#8221; would bring in the USA .Instead of bringing and freeing an &#8220;equal people&#8221; it basically unearthed anarchy in a form of lowering social,sexual,educational standards for all ctually weakening the USA/West but as the Left/Liberals/pathological multicults lose sight of their goal the harder they will try to enforce more PC madness.Please excuse my long rant-just needed to vent. </p>

<p>&#8220;Inter-species unions are common which begs the question as to whether people can shack up with their favorite zoo animal and no one would blink an eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing about Star Trek is that although most people think it is a very smart show (or franchise, now), being as realistic as science fiction can be, it actually cuts corners a lot, when it comes to science&hellip;</p>
<p>Living beings of different species, normally could not proceate together.  So all those inter-species relationships, and hybrid children (including half-human Mister Spock), wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Just like the captains two starships couldn&rsquo;t communicate with each other through radio transmissions, while their ships were travelling at the speed of light.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not even scratch the surface, of how starships could actually travel at speeds faster than that of light (a limit that no material object could reach)&hellip;</p>

		<p>The thing that comes to mind is that all of these people(at least the star trek ones, didn&rsquo;t see any of the other movies aside from the Matrix) didn&rsquo;t get their jobs due to affirmative action.  </p>
<p>As for Lando Calrissian, I rather liked that he was the only black man in the galaxy.  I thought it was amusing.  Didn&rsquo;t he own a space station or something?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I doubt that Avery Brooks will ever be asked to do a motion picture version of DS9. The show was totally forgettable&#8221;.</p>
<p>For at least a small number of fans DS9 is the favorite. Of all the shows it seemed a more accurate representation of what day-to-day life might really be like in the &#8216;Federation&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>I refuse to see any movie that has a black as a main character. There are also television shows I will not watch. I am sick to death of black actors being portrayed as incredibly knowledgeable scientists, computer wizards and all around world savers while the white men stand around helplessly looking to this mythological black to save their bacon. It is incredibly insulting to anyone who has any degree of intelligence.</p>

<p>Lando Calrissian was the leader of the people of a mining colony, who lived inside a city that, thanks to repulsor technology or something like that, just hung in the sky, aboce the surface of said planet. It was called Bespin, the Cloud City.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that the very firts time Lando saw princess Leia, he hit on her. And in the presence of Han Solo.</p>
<p>Lando joined the Rebellion, after Bespin was taken, and had become occupied, by Imperial Stormtroopers.</p>

		<p>I have been a Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan since the 1950&rsquo;s. I have known one Black, an intelligent gal, who like science fiction. I have known one Black guy, who like Sword and Sorcery, particularly Robert Howard&rsquo;s Conan series. That&rsquo;s it. The many other Blacks that I have known had no interest, regardless of the medium: books, movies, or TV.</p>
