<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/04/AR2010020404554.html">Anger Counselor Charged With Pulling Gun in Parking Flap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Jackman, Washington Post, February 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jose L. Avila, 57, was ordered held without bond pending a detention hearing Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. He has been held in the Fairfax jail since Jan. 25, when he apparently picked the wrong place and time to complain about thoughtless parking.</p>
<p>Avila&rsquo;s attorney, William A. Odio, said Avila had worked for many years at the nonprofit Center for Multicultural Human Services in Falls Church, which merged with Northern Virginia Family Service in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip} Judges and lawyers often referred people to Avila for pretrial or probationary counseling, particularly because he is bilingual.</p>
<p>Avila allegedly encountered two deputy U.S. marshals outside an apartment complex on Americana Drive, near Little River Turnpike and the Capital Beltway, at 9 a.m. Jan. 25. In a court affidavit, Deputy Marshal Floriano Whitwell said he and another marshal, Matthew M. Dumas, had been conducting a fugitive investigation and parked their sport-utility vehicles in designated parking places on Americana Drive.</p>
<p>Dumas got out of his vehicle and was standing at the window of Whitwell&rsquo;s vehicle when a white Jeep Cherokee drove up and the driver honked his horn, Whitwell wrote. Dumas, with a marshals service &#8220;badge clearly visible hanging from his neck,&#8221; motioned for the Cherokee to continue past. But then the Cherokee turned around and came back, Whitwell wrote.</p>
<p>The driver appeared to be motioning to Dumas, so the marshal moved closer. Then, Whitwell wrote, Dumas &#8220;noticed that Avila was aiming a gun at him. Avila was holding the gun and resting his hand on the top of the door with the driver&rsquo;s window completely open,&#8221; the affidavit states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The marshals identified themselves and tried to arrest Avila, but he was &#8220;uncooperative&#8221; and &#8220;continued to resist arrest and refused to give me his hand which was under his body,&#8221; Whitwell wrote. {snip}</p>
<p>Found on Avila&rsquo;s seat, Whitwell alleges, was a 9mm Astra A-90 pistol loaded with 14 hollow-point bullets. Once out of his vehicle, Avila reportedly apologized profusely and said he had &#8220;never done anything like this before,&#8221; the affidavit said. When he appeared with the marshals before a Fairfax magistrate, he claimed that he had pointed a cellphone, not a gun, at the marshals, Whitwell wrote.</p>
<p>The magistrate charged Avila with attempted malicious assault, brandishing a firearm, using a firearm in a felony and resisting arrest. Fairfax prosecutors dismissed those charges Wednesday after U.S. Magistrate Ivan D. Davis issued a warrant for assault on a federal officer, and Avila was transferred to federal custody Thursday.</p>

		<p>Call it &#8216;diversity&rsquo; all you want, but aren&rsquo;t these &#8216;bilingual&rsquo; requirements discrimination against regular old Americans?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall, in ages past, a massive need for these requirements for Italian, German, French, etc. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a racial angle at work here too?</p>

		<p>Notice how little detail we get about Jose Avila&rsquo;s racial makeup, yet how much information we get about the weapon he used:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;a 9mm Astra A-90 pistol loaded with 14 hollow-point bullets.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Obviously, it was the gun that made him do it. </p>

<p>Not at all, bilingulism is a good thing provided that a person learns a second language for personal use or when they travel abroad etc. However, what is bad is that when a country allows immigration to the point that being bilingual is necessary.<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being bilingual. What&rsquo;s wrong is using bilingualism as a ploy to discriminate against native born white Americans, the great majority of whom are not bilingual, by requiring bilingualism in jobs that historically never required it, and the purpose of which is to give preference to Hispanics in hiring, firing and promotion, while using bilingualism to further entrench the culture of massive Hispanic immigration. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with it.</p>

		<p>Hey, everyone, the only reason we think we need bilingual persons on staff is because of the refusal of Mexican immigrants to learn English.  It IS the Mexicans, too; Central and South Americans are only too eager to learn our language.  I know this from my experience teaching in the public schools in SoCA.  Point is, if we made speaking English a REQUIREMENT for immigrating to this country, then people like this Avila Cerote wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary.  It&rsquo;d sure save us a lot of unnecessary expenses and hassle!</p>

		<p>Just out of curiosity, what kind of drogos (drugs) was this Avila character on?  His only defense was &#8220;He&rsquo;d never done anything like that before???&#8221;  What&rsquo;s THAT got to do with it?  I bet there&rsquo;s a lot of things he&rsquo;s never done before, but there&rsquo;s a first time for everything, and we each are responsible for our every thought, word, and act&hellip;.  Wow, if he was arrested for indecent exposure, would he use the same defense?  Actually, it&rsquo;s good for our side, because that kind of brilliance would never win the case for him in a court of law&hellip;hopefully, he&rsquo;s on his way to a long free stay in a nearby prison&hellip;.</p>
