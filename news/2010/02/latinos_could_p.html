			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie Brandenburg, San Francisco Chronicle, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latino voters could play a key role in deciding the outcome of key 2010 political races across the country, including the California Senate and gubernatorial contests, a new report released Monday by liberal groups concluded.</p>
<p>The report from America&rsquo;s Voice, a group that advocates for comprehensive immigration reform, found that the economy remains the top issue of concern to Hispanics. But it concluded that candidates&rsquo; positions on immigration reform could make a big difference in hotly contested elections.</p>
<p>Eliseo Medina, international executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, called immigration reform a &#8220;litmus test&#8221; for many in the Latino community in deciding how to vote.</p>
<p>The report cited a poll concluding that 87 percent of Latino voters said they wouldn&rsquo;t consider voting for a candidate who was in favor of forcing most undocumented workers to leave the country.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer is running for reelection in the Senate against three Republican challengers. The gubernatorial race is wide open because current Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is term-limited.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>California is just one of the states where Latinos could sway results. Among the others: Florida, which has open-seat elections for Senate and governor; Nevada, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is in deep political trouble; Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry faces a contested GOP primary and a tough challenge from former Houston Mayor Bill White in the general election; New York and Colorado, where appointed Democrats are trying to win voters&rsquo; approval to fill the remainder of their terms; and Illinois, where Republican Mark Kirk is leading in the race to fill President Obama&rsquo;s former Senate seat.</p>
<p>Latino voters make up 21.1 percent of California voters.</p>

		<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s Voice&#8221; was created to counteract the successful fax and phone campaigns of NumbersUSA.  The organization should really be called &#8220;Mexico&rsquo;s Voice&#8221;, as it pushes relentlessly for open borders and illegal alien amnesty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately California has probably reached the tipping point, just as the open borders globalists intended.  There are now so many Mexicans in California voting (legally or otherwise) that it may be impossible to get a governor who will enforce immigration law.</p>

		<p>WR,. how can that be if they are only 21.1%?   Every time California has a vote to stop the freebies to the illegals, it is voted for OVERWHELMINGLY,.. it is a damn liberal judge who overrules it!   </p>
<p>Another thought,. IF all the whites left California, THEN WHO WOULD BE PAYING THE BILLS?  I keep hoping, and I hope NOT in vain, that there will be a taxpayer revolt in California and they will STOP all payments to any and all parasites.   Then the illegals would either leave or start rioting.  How much longer can the working people of California continue this madness?  The illegals numbers keep increasing and the taxpayers numbers keep decreasing, where is the tipping point? </p>

		<p>Latinos to play a &#8220;key role&#8221; in the governor&rsquo;s race? Real funny, when you consider Latinos have assuredly played a key role in California&rsquo;s fiscal woes and the crime and social problems that have plagued the Golden State for decades.</p>

		<p>What kind of &#8220;Key Role&#8221; would hispanics play in the Senate? The ability to drive the final nail into Californias continuing fall as an economically viable State, because of their well-known open borders view, which only imports more and more poverty from Mexico?</p>
