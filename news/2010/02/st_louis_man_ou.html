<h1>St. Louis Man Outraged by Description on Pizza Hut Receipt</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Belleville News-Democrat (Belleville, Illinois), February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A St. Louis man will take action after finding what he calls a racist remark on his receipt from Pizza Hut.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The words Mayberry saw on his Pizza Hut order ticket did not describe the pizza at all. He believes they described him. Where his name should have been, there were two adjectives instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was &#8216;big&rsquo; and &#8216;black,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mayberry could not believe it. The pizza had come from the store on Lindell. He compared receipts with another Pizza Hut just to be sure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mayberry was hurt and offended. After receiving his complaints, Pizza Hut officials responded. They gave Mayberry two $50 gift cards and a letter of apology. In it, they said they were both disappointed and embarrassed by the situation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken corrective action, including an employee training at this restaurant, to make sure our policies are adhered to,&#8221; said Chris Fuller, Pizza Hut spokesman.</p>
<p>Mayberry believes it&rsquo;s too little, too late. What&rsquo;s more, he said this happened on Martin Luther King Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be an African-American male and have that type of injustice done to you, especially by a Caucasian, on Martin Luther King holiday, it just threw me so hard,&#8221; Mayberry said.</p>
<p>After what happened, Mayberry feels the apology he received isn&rsquo;t enough, so now he&rsquo;s planning on taking legal action.</p>

		<p>Obviously this was a problem only because the employee was &#8220;Caucasian.&#8221; That fact alone empowers the customer to extort money from the &#8220;Caucasian&rsquo;s&#8221; employer. <br>
Change the races, and the customer would just have to walk away offended.</p>

		<p>This is what the St. Louis media get obsessed about.  Yet they only display 10% of this level of outrage when a pizza delivery driver is shot, robbed, set up and/or ambushed in St. Louis&rsquo;s ghetto sections, which happens several times a year around here.</p>

<p>My God. $100 and an apology wasn&rsquo;t enough?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is about correcting an injustice ($100 and an apology was more than enough); it&rsquo;s about a black man&rsquo;s hatred of white people and a psychopathic, vindicitive personality.</p>

		<p>I wonder just how many crimes blacks committed against whites in the St. Louis area at around the same time and how much media attention and how much outrage those crimes generated. </p>
<p>As it stands, there seems to be no such thing as outrage among whites over the wrongs committed by blacks, although those wrongs are beyond number. And yet, every day, we&rsquo;re subjected to yet another outraged black. It&rsquo;s getting tiresome. </p>

And it was an &#8220;injustice&#8221;<br>
Done to him by a &#8220;Caucasion&#8221;!<br>
On Martin Luther King holiday!!!</p>
<p>Oh, good lord. But on the bright side, if the blacks boycott pizza hut in st louis their sales will go through the roof. Because the whites will finally have a place to eat in peace.</p>

<p>The Ghetto Lottery and a morally corrupt black person with the emotional maturity of a pre-teen will net him a huge payday.  Thank you for playing! </p>

		<p>Sorry, But this is truly too funny! I mean seriously, where&rsquo;s the insult? Maybe the whiner didn&rsquo;t give his name, or mumbled it and the cashier didn&rsquo;t catch it. Then again, maybe the GUY SCRIBBLED THE WORDS&hellip; hoping to shake down the pizza place. Not an uncommon occurrence. Like that Mexican female who &#8220;found&#8221; a severed finger in her chili. A finger she obtained from a friend who lost it in an accident. </p>
<p>Can you spell F-R-A-U-D?  Or S-H-A-K-E D-O-W-N? Either term sounds most appropriate for this incident.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another story about our &#8220;fine people&#8221; of African descent. A children&rsquo;s birthday party at a Memphis Chuck-E-Cheese pizza place ended in a braw, as per a news tidbit on Netscape/AOL news. The &#8220;combatants&#8221; in the brawl&hellip; you&rsquo; guessed it. What a dysfunctional race of people. </p>

		<p>Pizza is not a traditional black food. Should he not have been eating something more in line with tradition, especially on MLK day.</p>
<p>Rob is probably right. The guy wanted a big pizza with black olives. Now, I guess restaurants need to give up abbreviations for orders and write everything in complete sentences. That will certainly speed up service.</p>

		<p>What most likely happened in this instance was that the person taking the order couldn&rsquo;t make out the customer&rsquo;s name, apparently lacking fluency in ebonics.  He (she) simply wrote the best description of the customer he could manage under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Any white who deals with blacks frequently, especially over the phone, experiences this problem.  It can take forever in some instances to figure out what they&rsquo;re asking for and how to spell their names.  And given the incredible number of weird names black parents visit on their offspring these days, this problem will only get worse. </p>

		<p>Of course he is suing. Two fifty dollar gift cards and an apology are nothing compared to the emotional trauma of having the words &#8220;bigblack&#8221; on your reciept, especially on MLK Day. The horrors. Only millions of dollars and intense therapy will help him poor dear, he&rsquo;s been scarred for life.</p>

		<p>Recently whilst in Las Vegas, my spouse and I were approached by a group of Japanese tourists who wanted to have their picture taken with us.  They were quite intrigued with the fact that we are both over six feet tall. They were so friendly that we couldn&rsquo;t refuse.  No doubt, they have showed their friends the pic of the Caucasian couple towering over them.  The idea of racism never entered our minds. It&rsquo;s OK to notice that we are all different. </p>
