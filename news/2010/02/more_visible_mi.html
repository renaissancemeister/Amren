<h1>More Visible Minorities at Closing, VANOC Hints</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>VANOC CEO John Furlong is hinting Canada&rsquo;s racial diversity may be better represented in the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics after criticism that ethnic minorities were mostly missing from the opening.</p>
<p>With its large South Asian and Chinese communities, Metro Vancouver is one of Canada&rsquo;s most diverse regions. Forty-one per cent of residents are part of visible minorities. But none of that diversity appeared in the big show that opened the 2010 Winter Games on Feb 12, critics say.</p>
<p>Canadian-born Sukhi Sandhu wrote a letter to Furlong, saying Olympic organizers missed an opportunity during the final torch-lighting ceremony &#8220;to represent our nation&rsquo;s diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandhu said he and his family are proud Canadians and excited to attend events at the Games, but he was disappointed visible minorities were excluded from key roles during the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I look at the eight individuals who carried the Olympic flag and the final torchbearers, who are all rightfully outstanding Canadians  &mdash;  no one is disputing that  &mdash;  however, out of 13 people there isn&rsquo;t one outstanding visible minority that you could think of  &mdash;  David Suzuki, Donovan Bailey, Jerome Iginla or Daniel Igali,&#8221; Sandu said.</p>
<p><b>Closing ceremony could offer more</b></p>
<p>This is not the first time the opening ceremony has been criticized for its lack of diversity. Federal Heritage Minister James Moore said earlier this week that &#8220;there should have been more French.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 21‚ÅÑ2-hour show that opened the Olympics in BC Place did include a segment showing immigrant families  &mdash;  including visible minorities  &mdash;  arriving in a cold northern ice land.</p>
<p>It also featured a strong First Nations segment, and segments highlighting the rainforests of the West Coast, eastern Canada&rsquo;s fiddling tradition, and the openness of the Prairies.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Furlong defended the opening ceremony but hinted the closing on Feb. 28 will be different.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did a very good job of showing Canada and we had a goal to tell a story, and at the closing ceremony .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we will have a very certain kind of celebration, and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll have any doubt when the ceremonies are over who we are and who&rsquo;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traditional Lion Dance was part of an special Olympic celebration held in Vancouver&rsquo;s Chinatown to mark the Olympics in Beijing in August 2008.

<p>Sandhu said he doesn&rsquo;t want to just see bhangra dancers or hear drumbeats. He wants to see accomplished visible minorities represented in the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our nation is a cultural mosaic, and our diversity is our strength and frankly I am surprised in 2010 we need to continue educating our leaders on this Canadian value,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;There is no shame or justifiable reason to not showcase this significant part of our nation&rsquo;s identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>His concerns are echoed by Peter Kwok, the chairman of the immigrant services organization SUCCESS, which provides services for new Chinese Canadians.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we have Chinese New Year, just a few days ago and when attending all those New Year&rsquo;s celebrations I have been chatting with people and I&rsquo;ve heard from quite a few people that they, too, feel that it was a spectacular show,&#8221; Kwok said. &#8220;And they only wish that they had a bit more portrayal of the multiculturalism in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charan Gill, the CEO of the Progressive Intercultural Community Services, an immigrant organization based in Surrey, B.C., said he tried to reach out to VANOC to encourage more visible minorities to get involved and volunteer for the Games but got no response.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t force ourselves on VANOC if they don&rsquo;t welcome us,&#8221; he said.<br>

<p>I agree. In order to convey this message, perhaps the organisers can flash across a giant screen the criminal stats of non-whites. Then as a finale, they could compare the rape statistics of black-on-white vs. the (non-existent) white-on-black rapes. I&rsquo;m sure the Swedes, French, Germans and Americans present will find something in common with my country. Then we can all smoke a big fat one, sing &#8220;we are the world&#8221; and rejoice in the genocide of our race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our nation is a cultural mosaic, and our diversity is our strength and frankly I am surprised in 2010 we need to continue educating our leaders on this Canadian value,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Perhaps you should &#8220;educate&#8221; the Asian teams. Afterall, Japan is 99% Japanese with most of the remainder Ainu. The Koreans are perhaps some of the most homogeneous nations on earth. And don&rsquo;t forget those Chinese. I think Canada and the Europeans have gotten all the education we can stand, especially our daughters.</p>

		<p>During the opening ceremonies The NBC commentators must have had a bet to see who could say &#8220;diversity&#8221; the most. The entire show was one big love/hate fest with many subtle comments of hate against whites in north America.</p>

		<p>These opening and closing ceremonies have become grotesque extravaganzas, each host country trying to top the previous one.  I would like to see some country with a trace of dignity just let the athletes walk once around the stadium and then out the back to a big picnic.  Simple, friendly, and civilized. </p>

		<p>The opening ceremonies hosted a number of non-Whites.  It was as obvious as the nose on your face that they were playing to this so-called &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; that is permeating all White countries.</p>

<p>We missed no &#8220;opportunity&#8221; whatsoever! </p>
<p>To illustrate MY nation&rsquo;s so-called &#8220;diversity&#8221;, let&rsquo;s be clear that Canada&rsquo;s visible-minorities only represent about 15% versus the 85% White majority. Most minorities (recent 3rd world immigrants) inhabit the major cities of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal and to a lesser effect, smaller cities such as Calgary or Brampton.</p>
<p>MY country may have some multicultural cities, but it&rsquo;s not a multi-culti <i>country</i> from my perspective, nor do I wish it to be one. </p>
<p>As much as <i>Sandhu</i> would hope more people that look like him, participate in these Olympic winter ceremonies, let&rsquo;s not capitulate to his race-carding, emotional blackmailing tactics. </p>
<p>Hardy northern Europeans were the founders and builders of this nation, not these first generation &#8220;Canadians&#8221; who represent themselves as being important enough by race to be included in our winter games.</p>

China&rsquo;s minorities were represented in Beijing&rsquo;s Opening Ceremony. They wore costumes and stood on the stage as the Olympic flag was raised.</p>
<p>If you took someone who knew absolutely nothing about Canada and made them watch the Vancouver Opening Ceremony last week&hellip; they would think that Canadians were basically aboriginal tree-hugging fiddlers who worship bear gods. The ceremony went downhill, much like the snowboarder at the start. Oh the irony.<br>

		<p>The racism of these supposed &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; is glaring in its conspicuousness. Peter Kwok, a Chinaman, runs an organization that helps only Chinese immigrants. Racist. Sukhi Sandhu, a supposedly patriotic Canadian, sat and watched an opening ceremony <i>filled</i> with Canadians but was ticked that not enough of them looked like him. Racist.</p>
<p>Point to the hypocrisy. They come to our countries, but they still hate us. They never stop pointing out the &#8220;rules&#8221; to whites, while they themselves ignore the rules with gall.</p>

		<p>Looking at Mr. Sandhu&rsquo;s friends on Facebook, I note that, of the 285 friends he has listed, perhaps not even one is white, and yet according to his letter he resides in Surrey, BC, where over 53% of the population is white. I suggest to Mr. Sandhu that he first try healing himself of his own racism before he goes off lecturing the white citizens of Canada who have welcomed he and so many of his co-ethnics with open arms.</p>

		<p>Guess the closing ceremonies won&rsquo;t be worth watching either&hellip; thanks to the criminal insanity of kow-towing to minorities and the nonsense called &#8220;political correctness.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for the Blacks to stage a formal protest, that no Black skiers were awarded gold medals. (Simply for participating.) When are we collectively going to regurgitate the liberal slop we&rsquo;ve had pumped into us during our school years and wake up? To the fraud and farce our liberal &#8220;intelligentsia&#8221; demands us to believe in?</p>

		<p>We are all going about these things in the wrong way.  Instead of fighting the diversity, we should embrace it.  There should be racial quotas (based on percentages of the population) for every sport, business, government institution, school classroom and even dating website, regardless of who opens these things.  Imagine that!  25% of the NBA must be Latino.  Match.com would have to host 70% as whites.  AfroRomance would have to recruit 70% whites or be forced out of business.  Rap labels would have to recruit 70% white rappers, and on and on.  Of course, the representation of blacks and many other minorities would actually go down in an awful lot of places.  In some places where it would go up, say in advanced classes in college or High School, their lack of seriousness or competence would become glaring.  There would be tons of other benfits, because after everything starts to fall apart, there will be a hue and cry for a return to the meritocracy!</p>
