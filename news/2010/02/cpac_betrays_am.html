<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=125647">CPAC Betrays America on Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Tancredo, WorldNetDaily, February 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, is meeting in Washington, D.C., this weekend to hear well-known political leaders like Dick Cheney and Newt Gingrich talk about prospects for electoral victories in 2010. This is an annual event dating back to 1974, and I have been there as a speaker myself a few times. But CPAC 2010 is different.</p>
<p>This year, the Beltway leaders of conservatism are racing hard to catch up with a parade they did not launch and cannot control. Across America, grass-roots patriots and anti-Obama protests have changed the political landscape in ways conservatism&rsquo;s entrenched Beltway Politburo did not anticipate.</p>
<p>The small Beltway Politburo that runs CPAC is worried. They are witnessing a growing conservative populism that owes its strength to ordinary people who have &#8220;had enough,&#8221; not to policy wonks and lobbyists who must work at the margins of political compromise. The new citizen activists take their moral bearing from the Constitution, not from pollsters and focus groups.</p>
<p>Thus, it was predictable that conservatism&rsquo;s leading beltway Mafioso chose the week of CPAC to release the newly minted Mount Vernon Statement, a consensus document aimed at updating the landmark Sharon Statement of 1960. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, 50 years later, conservatism can draw 4,000 activists to Washington, D.C., in the middle of winter to celebrate successes and debate policy strategies. But instead of building on the consensus that already exists on key issues, the Beltway Politburo strives to demonstrate their superior cleverness by undermining the grass-roots consensus. On two key issues, CPAC offered detours and blind alleys, not leadership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The best example of how CPAC 2010 has failed the conservative movement is CPAC&rsquo;s attempt to redefine (sabotage would be a more accurate term) the potent issues of illegal immigration and border security. Whereas grass-roots conservatives and millions of 912 patriots  &mdash;  along with 80 percent of the American people  &mdash;  understand the need for border security as a precondition for immigration reform, CPAC board member Grover Norquist is busy launching a new project in support of the Obama administration&rsquo;s plan to grant another amnesty to 20 million illegal aliens. Neither border control nor immigration enforcement was included as a topic for any of the CPAC general sessions.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly odd that at the very moment everyone else is declaring the Democrats&rsquo; amnesty plan dead in the water, CPAC leader Grover Norquist and a handful of Republican lobbyists are conspiring to resuscitate it. It&rsquo;s as though the pilots of an airplane headed to Houston decided instead to take the aircraft to Havana. But instead of a hijacking, conservatism&rsquo;s Beltway Politburo calls it a strategic partnership with Latino activists.</p>
<p>What all this tells us is that it is not only the Republican Party that is suffering an identity crisis. So is conservatism.<br>

		<p>After the Council of Conservative Citizens withdrew its sponsorship of CPAC in 1999 because CPAC was trucking in so many so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; black speakers, I knew that CPAC was on its way out.  Now, CPAC has become a weird hybrid of relatively young, hard-right libertarians in the audience, and a bunch of neo-con and lamestream conservative speakers.  A house divided against it self cannot last, and I predict the young righties will blink first, for while they have the enthusiasm and energy, the neos and lamers have the corporate PAC and 527 money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy (somewhat) that Ron Paul won the straw poll, but CPAC straw polls aren&rsquo;t worth much.  Again, it will be a matter of corporate money to favored establishment candidates and the propaganda TV ads they buy.  That will decide the Republican nominee in 2012, probably.</p>

		<p>Calling people such as Dick Cheyney, Newt Gingrich, Grover Norquist, John McCain, etc., etc., ad nauseum conservative is ridiculous. These people are simply elitist opportunists that have a slightly different view than the &#8220;progressive&#8221; faction that occupies the other side of the tip of the pyramid. </p>
<p>If you picture U.S. society as a pyramid with various levels, you can visualize what I mean. Various levels of the pyramid are occupied by the various levels of economic society. As you go higher on the pyramid from the base to the apex, each level is occupied by less people who are increasingly fortunate economically. The tip of the pyramid is occupied by the elite. They don&rsquo;t agree on everything, and their are various factions. </p>
<p>What they do agree on is that they want to stay at the top. The living is good there. They believe that those less fortunate at the lower levels are less worthy than they. They have figured out that keeping the various levels in eternal war with each other enables them to stay at the top. Best of all, by controlling government, they can use the wealth of the middle levels of the pyramid for their &#8220;good&#8221; causes and to keep the lower levels continually at war with the middle. </p>
<p>Those at the top have factions, so they fight with one another. But they don&rsquo;t want to be displaced. So they continue to add to the lowest tier of the pyramid by promoting immigration and other schemes to keep the lower levels lusting after the wealth of the productive middle tiers. A simple plan that has been used against the bourgeosie from time immemorial. You&rsquo;d think that we&rsquo;d have it figured out by now. But the apex dwellers can count on us to never figure it out!</p>

		<p>Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans offer a suitable future for America.  Both are slightly different versions of the same corrupt, cynical, and bankrupt politic.</p>
<p>America needs a new party, based on the ideals our founding Fathers expressed in the Constitution.</p>

		<p>Ir is obvious to myself and a lot of others both racial realists such as myself and otherwise that CPAC and the Republican National Convention not to mention a few other supposidly conservative organizations are controlled by interests that are not the least bit conservative in the traditional sense. I sincerely want to see conservatives turn away from the Republican Party. American third Position Party is a third option from the two party death grip.</p>

		<p>CPAC is embarrassed by the fact that Ron Paul won hands down a CPAC straw poll a few days ago that sent the neocons into a frenzied fit.  It probably made our alien overlords a little nervous that the public didn&rsquo;t buy their big media push for their favorite &#8220;wars forever&#8221; hero Sarah Palin.  No wonder she stayed away from this event.  Her whole FOX News media image would have been destroyed by all the boos and cat calls.  CPAC is merely reassuring them that all is well with this amnesty proposal.  <br>

		<p>To borrow a signature phrase of the Tea Party movement, it&rsquo;s time to be silent no more. Open-borders Norquist is backing shamnesty ringleader John McCain in Arizona and pushing a new &ldquo;comprehensive immigration reform&rdquo;/illegal alien amnesty II initiative.<br>
I&rsquo;ll bet McCain does not bring this up in Arizona as he runs for reelection.  This gives his rival, J.D. Hayworth a silver bullet.</p>
<p> Hayworth has already said that McCain campaigns as a conservative and votes as a liberal.  </p>
<p>A pox on the houses of both Norquist and McCain!!!</p>

<p>How many more losses will it take before the GOP decides to change its tactics? Or will it take the formation of an entirely new party?</p>

		<p>As soon as the tea parties began to get success outside of the mainstream parties, the party that is closest ideologically to them - the Republicans - thought that they could co-opt them. It would only be a few short steps across an imaginary isle to take it back from the bumpkins and co-opt the votes and dollars that this movement represents. </p>
<p>This past weekend&rsquo;s meeting was the opening salvo. Nordquist, Gingrich, Bennett, and their ilk will become &#8220;spokesmen&#8221; as they are already trying to do and that will redeliver the movement to them. There - back in the saddle again!</p>
<p>That must not be allowed to happen! Who the hell is Gingerich? Bennett? Nordquist? They reprsent to elitist plutocracy that is shepherding the herding of the country into &#8220;diverse&#8221; manageable sectors that they will incorporate into the New World Order. </p>
<p>Already they are reviving George W. Bush! Signs, T-shirts, cups, curios decorated with a grinning W and the saying: &#8220;Do you miss me yet?&#8221; My answer: &#8220;Hell no!&#8221; You should be awaiting trial for lying our nation into a phony war and killing many thousands of people. You should be in jail for profligate and, I believe, unconstitutional squander of U.S. wealth to other nations and causes not in the interests of the U.S. Greenspan, Bernanke, and many others should be there with him. </p>
<p>The last half century have been about a great betrayal of the American prople by their elite leaders. We must now exclude these people from our movements and councils and operate as if they were the enemy - they are. </p>
<p>Exclude them from our councils, stop spending money as much as possible in this system. Take from them the one tool that keeps them in power - money! Starve the ugly beast of its food (money) and it will wither and die. While you are saving and helping to build a new, real economy, you can be denying the evil ones the thing they need the most - starve the plutocratist beast! </p>

		<p>Yes, Republi(cons) are as useless as demo(rats) to the American taxpaying citizen. Yet some people on this forum keep suggesting that change can come from within the Republican party. Can a Zebra change its stripes? Most citizens have not been served well by either of the two entrenched parties and it is shear inertia, that keeps Americans believing that they can be served by either one of these self-serving and corrupt organizations. We need a third party, supported by at least eighty million Americans.</p>

		<p>The conservative establishment is basically a coalition of &#8220;business&#8221; people who only care about money, even if they have to destroy America to get it, and neocons who&rsquo;s loyalty is to a foreign country and who are willing to destroy America for own ethnic agenda.

		<p>For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, is anyone here STILL surprised to hear these things? Conservatism, insofar as any coherent movement even exists, has been a deadend for White people for decades now! Does anyone not recall how &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; arrogantly rejected Buchanan time and again in the 90&rsquo;s, favoring all manner of globalist, interventionist, open-borders Wall Street Journal types instead? What have these great Conservatives offered Whites in terms of leadership, recognition, protection, etc? </p>
<p>I am all for conservative(small &#8220;C&#8221;) ideals that appeal to many of us, but as political movements and ideologies go, people need to wake up and realize movement Conservatism(Neo, Paleo, etc.) is all really only a slightly less offensive that liberalism when it comes to the most critical issues of all - race! As I have said here many times, we forget or ignore this at our own continued peril. </p>

		<p>This so-called two party system is not a two party system.  It has become impossible to tell the Republicans from the Democrats.  Until recently, voting became a vote for the lesser of two evils.  Now all I see is two evils.  There are still some republicans who are true to the conversative values and our Constitution but they are far and in between.  And that&rsquo;s why the &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; is being hammered and smeared the way it is.   Unless people start to realize that if we lose our freedoms here, the United States is the last stand on earth.  There is no other country that has been such a force for good in the world.  If we go, there is no place left on the planet.</p>

		<p>The best thing the tea partiers can do is work within the political system to influence either established party.  A separate party, at this early stage anyway, will not be strong enough to win any seats more powerful than those in the House, at best.  And certainly, we don&rsquo;t want to divide conservatives and put Obama back in for another term!  <br>
The Republican establishment doesn&rsquo;t want populists, but it almost got one in Huckabee last time.  Common people, with their votes, control who the nominees will be in both big parties.  The wealthy men who run the GOP can be pushed aside by everyday citizens if there are enough of them.</p>

		<p>All those who put their faith in any political person or party or group will be disappointed.  As others have noted, you cannot comment on any &#8220;conservative&#8221; website about race and immigration without being banned, and you cannot call any conservative talk-show host and try to discuss the same issues.  They are beyond the acceptable limits of these people&rsquo;s faux conservatism.  And for those who put their faith in Tea Party groups, that battle has already been lost.  Most of them prominently feature self-proclaimed conservative Blacks (must show our multicultural credentials, mustn&rsquo;t we), and immigration is a non-starter.  You just can&rsquo;t discuss the issue in a rational manner; you are just as likely to be shunned as a &#8220;racist/sexist/homophobe/antisemite/bigot&#8221; (take your pick) at a Tea Party as you are in society at large.  I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t share others&rsquo; faith that somewhere there exists a majority of Americans who agree on this.  Decline and fall.</p>

		<p>OWL, a new party is never going to be strong enough to win elections at first.  Obama isn&rsquo;t any worse on racial issues than than Bush or McCain.  Your kind of thinking is old fashioned and a big part of the reason we are in this mess.  By your logic, it will NEVER be the right time to stop voting GOP.  The obsession with conservatism among racialists is something that will die out over time.  It&rsquo;s the failed strategy of the baby boom generation.  Younger racialists are not falling for it.  </p>

		<p> Why on earth would any thinking person vote for the republicans? They stand for nothing. On a political spectrum they exist in an ever fluid position somewhere to the right of communism but never for true economic freedom and liberty.</p>
<p> They&rsquo;re just a party of liberals that find the democrats to be too extreme.</p>

		<p>I attended CPAC on Saturday (I didn&rsquo;t get the word about the &#8220;Conference in Exile&#8221; in time). What Tancredo says is true, with one exception.</p>
<p>There was a panel put on by the American Council for Immigration Reform with Robert Rector (from Heritage, no less!) and Mark Krikorian, which was excellent.  </p>
<p>So there is still hope!</p>

		<p>What sickened me the most about this so-called &#8220;conservative&#8221; conference was the warm embrace of the homosexual movement, and the endorsement of it by fake conservative sites such as the clowns at Hot Air.<br>
I wonder how long it will take before CPAC starts shilling for child p$rn, and Allahpundit waxes eloquently for NAMBLA?<br>
The only positive thing about it was that the John Birchers showed up in force, and apparently got a warm reception from some of the younger conservatives.</p>

		<p>We have to realize that the two parties have the same agenda, just slightly different tactics, end game resulting in a global government. playing the D vs R game is obfuscation that pretends that is not so.<br>
The thing that attracts so many people about the tea party is its basis on Constitutionalism, something that the status quo has long forgotten, unless it is useful for them to quote from.<br>
Those of us that are not in a fog recognize that the only way to save this nation from turning into another mediocrity is to return and adhere to the Constitutional principles upon which this nation became THE superpower in the world.<br>

		<p>Re #2 post<br>
Brilliant and of course correct. Reminiscent of the famous fictional dogmatic work inside &#8220;1984&#8221;&hellip;regarding the High, Middle and the Low. Opened my eyes more or less permanently then and should be read by all aspirant writers or critics.<br>
As long as writers such as Orwell keep appearing there is not hope, but at least there is insight.</p>
