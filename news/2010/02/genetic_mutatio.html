<h1><a href="https://www.healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=636176">Genetic Mutation Linked to Prostate Cancer in Blacks</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>HealthDay News, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Researchers have identified a mutation in a small number of black American men with a family history of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>This germline mutation of the androgen receptor (AR) may prove to be a genetic biomarker for familial prostate cancer in the black American male population, according to the team at Louisiana State University in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Black American men have a higher incidence of prostate cancer than any other racial group. The small amount of research that&rsquo;s been done on the role that AR mutations play in prostate cancer has been limited to white men.</p>
<p>This study found a germline AR-A1675T substitution mutation in the DNA-binding domain in three black American men with a family history of early-onset prostate cancer. This mutation may contribute to prostate cancer by &#8220;altering the AR DNA-binding affinity and its response to androgens, non-androgenic steroids or anti-androgens,&#8221; according to a news release about the study.</p>
<p>The study was published online this week in the Asian Journal of Andrology.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to learn more about the role this mutation plays in prostate cancer in black Americans, the researchers said.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is one of the genes that I have been <a href="https://theunsilencedscience.blogspot.com/2010/01/epistemology-endocrinology.html" rel="nofollow">writing</a> about.  This gene has a region of tandem repeats that helps determine how much a receptor responds to testosterone.  Since this region is shorter in black people, they seem more masculine.  A shorter promoter is also associated with rape and murder.  In fact, the average African-American has as many repeats in this region as the average rapist.</p>

		<p>There is something even more so at work here.</p>
<p>Black men over the age of forty generally speaking are extremely hesitant to get a routine physical exam.</p>
<p>A reason why! These men ove the age of forty know that the doc will want to do the digital rectal exam.</p>
<p>This requires of course a procedure that to a black man is most humilitating even more so psychologically than to a white man. The black man believes he has been homosexually violated and is lesser of a man for it. </p>
<p>Hesitancy to have the routine physical and digital rectal exam means that these cancers are not caught UNTIL IT IS WAY TOO LATE!</p>
<p>Just a fact!!</p>
<p>And again, has nothing whatsoever to do with lack of access to medical care, the white doctors and nurses hate black men, the Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221; Study, etc.</p>

<p>New studies like this are often published online before going into an issue of the journal.  You can find a free copy of this study <a href="https://www.nature.com/aja/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/aja20105a.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The study acknowledges that this mutation may be linked to the CAG repeat region that I mentioned, which is already thought by some scientists to be associated with prostate cancer.  Also, the African Americans come from New Orleans, where African Americans tend to have high European admixture, according to Parra et al.  One study found that about a third of African Americans have an X chromosome from Europe.  (The AR gene is located on this chromosome.)  Only one of the 15 African American families had this mutation, and we do not know if it came from their African ancestry or their European ancestry.  The HapMap Web site does not have any information on this mutation.</p>
<p>This study also confirms previous studies that African Americans tend to have fewer CAG repeats than white people, but these individuals, who were selected from families with high risk for prostate cancer, tend to have more CAG repeats than is typical of the general population.<br>

<p>Right!</p>
<p>Blacks have sickle cell anemia, now this genetic mutation, and other genetic disorders. Jews have Crohn&rsquo;s disease, Tay Sachs plus other genetically based disorders. Whites have cystic fibrosis. All genetically based.</p>
<p>And yet race doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
