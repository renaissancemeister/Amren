<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hip-hop made a dent at last night&rsquo;s Grammy Awards with Jay-Z picking up the trophies for Best Rap Song (&#8216;Run This Town&rsquo;) and Best Rap Performance (&#8216;Death of Auto-Tune&rsquo;), and Eminem winning for Best Rap Performance By a Duo (&#8216;Crack a Bottle&rsquo;) and Best Rap Album (&#8216;Relapse.&rsquo;) But Fabolous and Q-Tip still had a bone to pick with Grammy organizers. Both rappers {snip} more upset about the lack or air time the hip-hop categories were allotted during the show. Loso and Tip tweeted live during the award show, questioning the decision to award hip-hop honors off the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Grammys .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thanx 2 everyone who supported me &amp; Loso&rsquo;s Way. Wish me luck 2 bring home this grammy 2nite!!&#8221; Fab wrote before the awards were announced. He then followed up with another Tweet, questioning the programming. &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t the hip-hop/rap categories get televised?? We are a big part of music 2day, even in mainstream America.&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Q-Tip {snip} was noticeably annoyed by the Grammy scheduling. {snip} &#8220;Y were none of the hip-hop categories on t.v. for grammys?&#8221; Tip wrote.&#8221;Wow! Comedy category gets airtime but NO F  &mdash;  ing love for Hip Hop. This is some bulls  &mdash;  .&#8221;</p>

<p>Gosh, I wonder why they don&rsquo;t want these &#8220;artists&#8221; to be up their representin&rsquo; the Grammys.  </p>
<p>Of course, even when they aren&rsquo;t supposed to be up on stage they shove themselves up there anyway (Kanye West).</p>

		<p>But there&rsquo;s always BET they can watch for hip hop awards.</p>
<p>However, the only thing I think about when I think of BET is the desire for a la carte cable pricing to come quickly.</p>

		<p>They didn&rsquo;t broadcast the heavy metal award either and that is pretty much all white. MTV promotes hip-hop and rap 24/7 so they have no reason to complain.</p>

		<p>Setting aside the Hip-Hop behavior/culture issues, there are plenty of musical genres that have been given short shrift by the grammys forever. Heavy Metal(and its numerous sub-genres), Punk, and various Alternative genres, just for instance, have been routinely ignored altogether by the grammy establishment.<br>
 <br>
The whole thing is a farce, Hip-Hop or not, quite honestly.</p>

AGAIN, the SOLUTION is to start YOUR OWN awards show. Run it how you want. Anything goes. Guns, knives, feuds, dissin&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in the work of Mr. Jay-Z (a man Oprah praises on her show) may I suggest his rap, &#8220;99 Problems&#8221;? </p>
<p>&#8220;99 Problems&#8221; Lyrics:</p>

		<p>If these Bantu rappers are so upset about the &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; awards portion not being televised, then I have a solution. They should demand that the Grammys be broadcast exclusively on BET cable network. They should even threaten riots and boycotts unless the Grammys are carried by BET. Everyone would win in this situation.</p>
<p>BET would get a lot of exposure.</p>
<p>Bantus would be on a Bantu-friendly network.</p>
<p>And Caucasians would simply switch channels.   </p>

		<p>After about 40 years of witnessing the disgusting erosion of society via my television, coupled with defiant refusal of the cable and satellite providers to provide a la carte options, I completely disconnected my television service over a year ago. Even if they offered me free a la carte service for life at this point, there is no way I would ever sign on. I am dead serious!</p>
<p>I do not miss the multicultural propaganda of television in the least. More than that, I certainly do not miss funding the destruction of my race and my culture! Television? Never again! I am quite happy reading instead.</p>

		<p>My God!  Who cares about the Shammys anyway?  There have been many awards given over the years for some wretched aweful &#8220;music.&#8221;  The whole ceremony could be dominated by hip-hop and it wouldn&rsquo;t suprise me at all.  Neither would the gunfights that would occur halfway through the show.  If these two &#8220;artists&#8221; are worried about face time on an awards show, perhaps it&rsquo;s because of a lack of &#8220;street-cred.&#8221;  Yup, &#8220;street-cred&#8221; (whatever that is) wins you more awards than talent or ability.  Nice genre.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fabolous, Q-Tip Question Lack of Airtime for Hip-Hop Categories at Grammys&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even understand the heading for this topic when I read it. Not until I clicked on the body of the article did I realize there were human beings (of a sort) calling themselves &#8220;Q-Tip&#8221; and &#8220;Fabolous&#8221;.  It was bad enough when these &#8220;artists&#8221; took to giving themselves names with absurd spellings.  At least they were names of a sort.  But now they are naming themselves after consumer hygiene products.  It reminds of a CNBC reporter&rsquo;s reaction to Apples latest consumer gizmo, the iPad.  She said it reminded her of something for sell in the feminine hygiene aisle at the drug store.  Steve Jobs must have spotted the latest trend in our culture to emerge from the richness of diversity.  New names? Shampoo? D-otter-Ant? T-klm-Pwdr? </p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t bother you. That&rsquo;s when the blacks have won. When they think our white women dating them is a victory. I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s her right to listen to rap. Hell, I admit that I did some 15 or 18 years ago. The difference, though, is back then it wasn&rsquo;t about killing whitey and breaking the law and packin&rsquo; heat and slappin&rsquo; hoes. It was a little but now every song is about that. Back then it was maybe 5 or 10 percent of the songs. Another thing. I dated white women who listened to rap, but came back to white guys because they knew that most blacks didn&rsquo;t have a future because they actually BELIEVED in the lyrics they were listening to. That&rsquo;s the thing with blacks. They can&rsquo;t decipher fantasy from reality. Too stupid. </p>

		<p>When I first heard hip-hop approx. 25 years I was struck how monotonous it was and I figured it had a shelf life shortly than disco.</p>
<p>I find it mind-boggling that it is still popular today and it has gone from monotonous to appalling and disgusting.</p>

		<p>Well, maybe it has something to do with the kind of behavior the people behind the Grammies know rappers are capable of&hellip; I suppose they don&rsquo;t want another Kanye West-style incident live on television; kids might realize the hip-hop non-artists are just a bunch of untalented thugs who aren&rsquo;t worth buying their CDs&hellip;</p>

		<p>Musical talent went extinct after the &#8216;80&rsquo;s.  Rap is nothing more than english  lessons for black people disguised as music.  <br>
Classic Rock &amp; Roll was the last generation of true musicians. Nowadays, everything is hijacked or copied from this genre, there no longer anything original (unless you consider screeching, dischord, and vulgarity &#8216;new&rsquo;).</p>

		<p>What passes for rock and roll these days is the &#8220;singers&#8221; growling like dogs, against a backdrop of what sounds like a motor running. No guitars, drums or organs - nothing like that at all.</p>

<p>You mean, the three chord crowd?  How creative is that?  Personally, I enjoy trance music and find it much more beautiful and creative than any &#8220;dinosaur boogie (rock music)&#8221;.</p>

		<p>@ Techno Dan (20):</p>
<p>I used to love techno music, Dan. Back in the early 90&rsquo;s, I owned many synthesizers, and I did a little DJing. </p>
<p>I used to be a very creative movement, for an open-minded crowd. But some elements of it, were stolen by the Black hip-hop movement, which more or less co-opted them. </p>
<p>So, a part of techno music has become, in some ways, &#8220;blackened&#8221;. And I would say it stopped evolving around 1995 or so.</p>
