			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Boudreau, Gear Live Media, February 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Negro Leagues Hall of Fame is in trouble. Faced with the dwindling economy, the museum is facing the very real threat that they may have to close their doors. Located in Kansas City, the Hall opened its doors in 1990, and for the last 20 years has continued to teach thousands of baseball fans about the injustices in the history of the game for decades. Not being allowed to play in the MLB until Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947, African-Americans began their own leagues as early as 1887 to play the greatest game in the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The museum is celebrating its 20th year and plans to continue that celebration. They are preserving the Negro League Baseball culture with their hundreds of displays, and chart the history of the Negro Leagues with pictures, autographed balls, exhibits, lockers, equipment, and more. Fans can tour the museum and see all of this. At the end of the tour is the Field of Legends, where tourists can walk onto a field with near-life size bronze statues of some of the greatest African-American players to ever pick up a bat, including Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, and Cool Papa Bell.</p>
<p>While the museum is openly admitting financial troubles, they are not going as far as to say that they will be closing their doors anytime soon. {snip} This museum deserves to stay alive. {snip} To lose such a monument would not only be the greatest insult to baseball, but also to those who were ever told they couldn&rsquo;t play it.<br>

<p>I believe black history tourism is a dead end. <br>
 <br>
This is not how I would like to spend my vacation or weekend; learning about &#8216;the injustices in the history of the game&rsquo; or any other &#8216;injustice&rsquo;. Anyone who does must have a screw loose. </p>

		<p> Oh, yes, indeedy! Let&rsquo;s have yet another pity party for the African Americans who &#8220;weren&rsquo;t allowed to play&#8221; baseball. Let&rsquo;s by all means preserve this museum that is mainly designed to try to make White people feel guilty. Or let&rsquo;s &#8220;move it to another location,&#8221; as the writer suggests; bet THAT would solve all its financial problems! I don&rsquo;t follow his logic on that point of the column at all.</p>
<p> I also noticed that he was at great pains to say the museum&rsquo;s directors could give a lesson in &#8220;integrity&#8221; to the owners of the National Hockey League. I wonder that he didn&rsquo;t call it the &#8220;All-White National Hockey League.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t the mega rich black Americans help? Where are the &#8220;rap artissss&#8221;, the &#8220;basset&#8221; ball playas, CBC, NAACP, SPLC, BET, $harpton, Jack$on, Tiger Woods, Oprah etc., etc.. Also, there was a report on the sharp rise in the buying power of black Americans, where are they!<br>
Why would they give THEIR money to help THEIR people when they can always shake down Whitey for it. You know how it goes - &#8220;gib us some money or you be a racisss, know what am sayin.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Writer Boudreau thinks blacks not playing major league baseball was &#8220;the greatest insult&#8221;? Has he forgotten the &#8220;Black Sox Scandal of 1919? If it wasn&rsquo;t for Babe Ruth&rsquo;s heroics in the aftermath of that scandal, there might have been no league Jackie Robinson could play in.</p>
<p>Boudreau is just dripping with self-hate. Nothing to see here, move along.</p>

		<p>To step out of my ethnopatriotic identity for a moment, and take on the view of a person who truly wants to &#8220;move beyond race,&#8221; the trend we&rsquo;ve seen of silly racially tribalist black monuments undergoing financial difficulty can only be seen as a good thing.</p>
<p>As &#8220;African-American&#8221; and &#8220;Black American&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; become just &#8220;American&#8221; or &#8220;human&#8221;, as the world becomes post-racial and the races become the human race, it only makes sense that the monuments of the dead tribalist cultures crumble into dust and fade from memory.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this what the &#8220;post-racial&#8221; believe?  What they should be wishing for and working toward?</p>
<p>The people who make money from these tribalisms will do everything they can to prevent this decay.  Thus they are by definition enemies of the &#8220;post racial.&#8221;  Ironic, no?</p>

		<p>Black men make up 10.2% of MLB players as of 2009, which is roughly 75 players. The average Major League Salary is $3 million dollars. Assuming those 75 players make the average salary, that is $225 million dollars. If those players donated a measly 1% of their gross incomes, that would be a $2.25 million dollar contribution to the museum.</p>
<p>The black players should try and preserve their own history if they have the means to do so. Retired black players who have made a fortune playing baseball should consider the same.</p>

		<p>I submit for your review the following line:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;for the last twenty years has continued to teach thousands of baseball fans about the injustices in the history of the game.&#8221;<br>
   Maybe they should have made their first priority teaching about the game itself or about player historys, or statistics instead of the &#8220;injustices&#8221; in the history.<br>
   Is it any wonder your average white fan doesn&rsquo;t go?  Who wants to pay to go to a museum to be told your race is evil?<br>
   Is it any wonder blacks aren&rsquo;t flocking to the museum?  That generally involves difficulties like paying an entrance fee and &#8220;reading stuff&#8221; or, God forbid, statistical analysis.<br>
   Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some government money coming from the lefties to keep it open.</p>

<p>For a wonderful, similar culturally enriching experience, come to Cincinnati and visit the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Nothing like packing the family up and coming to see ropes, shackles,and other paraphernalia from the days of slavery. This cost many million$ of White taxpayer dollars and takes many more to keep it afloat. I guess the 2 or 3 hundred PAYING folks who visit each year just cant financially support this &#8220;White&#8221; elephant. Most days you can see the place surrounded by yellow school buses. They may not be profitable, but they sure are successful at indocritnating our kids in how to think correctly about the evil White man. </p>

		<p>I have to agree with one of the other posters here. Where are all the wealthy black sports figures, actors, singers when it comes to helping their own? I can tell you where they are NOT they are not doing a thing to help, they seem to never give hep, just beg Mr Mean Ole Whitey to carry them through. If they want their museum let them prove it with their check books. White Americans couldn&rsquo;t even legally have such a thing without being called RACIST, the phoniest word in the English language..</p>

<p>Did they start their own league or did whitey start it for them?</p>
<p>Also, most people don&rsquo;t know that white all stars played against black all stars in Mexico at least once with whites beating the supposedly better black athletes.<br>

		<p>Tim&rsquo;s points (post #8) would be valid if we weren&rsquo;t talking about blacks. This is the race, after all, that <a href="https://stuffblackpeopledontlike.blogspot.com/2009/07/22-saving-money-for-future.html" rel="nofollow">refuses to save a dime</a> regardless of income. Many black pro athletes are destitute soon after their careers are over even if they pulled down nine figures as players.</p>
<p>Of course, given <a> all the illegitimate kids blacks must support</a>, the lack of spare change becomes easier to understand.</p>

<p>Actually, there are no Guatemalans in the MLB.  It&rsquo;s demographic is mainly from Dominican Republic, Mexico, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico.  The MLB demographics are far from perfect, but largely preferable to the 75-85% black NBA and NFL, in my opinion.</p>

		<p>Why did blacks need to play in a white league to begin with?  If they are so great, why could they not survive or even prevail in a black league?  It is the same with schools.  If blacks are as smart as whites, why can&rsquo;t they do as well as or even better than whites in separate schools?  What about neighborhoods?  Why do they want to live among those whom they accuse of all sorts of demeaning behavior?  Again and again,  blacks love to extol the evils of whites while forcing themselves into white areas.  Is this not a tacit admission of inferiority?</p>

		<p>13 Sosthenes: I visited Los Angeles about ten years ago, and thought I&rsquo;d go see the Watts Towers.  It&rsquo;s in a ghetto, but I figured that being a landmark and all, it would be safe enough during the day.  Not so.  There was nobody on the street, except for some thuggish Black teens.  I figured I&rsquo;d take a clue from all the residents who stayed away, and left.  Too bad, I really wanted to see the towers.</p>

		<p>This is another example of the genocide that mid western republicans and big city democrats have perpetrated on black folk. When the above two conflicting power groups united to start the food stamp program to pauperize future generations of blacks and increase agricultural prices by 10%,all the achievements of struggling black folks were flushed away. Blacks are too broke to do anything but put out their hands for handouts or robbery plunder. Imagine what a veteren of the 58th Mass would think watching his great great grandsons strut around without a job, a wife but with three kids and a criminal record. What would Cool Papa bell think of Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa trashing the game he would have sold his soul to play at the major league level. Think of what the Tuskeegee Airman survivors feel when they watch rapping punks abuse and denigrate their grand daughters.I am no libral; however it makes me sick to see what we have done to black people. It is close to what happened to the 16th century Aztecs and Mayans.<br>
