<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61H5XD20100218">Black Farmers Win $1.25 Billion in Discrimination Suit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jasmin Melvin, Reuters, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black farmers who were discriminated against by the U.S. Agriculture Department will receive $1.25 billion in a settlement, the USDA and the Justice Department said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The settlement of the case, known as Pigford II, is contingent on Congress approving $1.15 billion for the farmers, in addition to $100 million already provided in the Farm Bill.</p>
<p>The original Pigford case, named after North Carolina farmer Timothy Pigford, ended in 1999 after the government agreed to compensate black farmers left out of USDA loan and assistance programs due to racism.</p>
<p>Farmers able to provide proof of their claims of discrimination were awarded $50,000, but tens of thousands of claims were denied for missing the filing deadline.</p>
<p>The settlement in Pigford II would allow these farmers to again make their claims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black farmers able to demonstrate they suffered from discrimination would get up to $50,000 and debt relief.</p>
<p>A separate, more in-depth claims process could provide some farmers with up to $250,000 in damages. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Any foreclosure on farms with pending claims will be halted until the claims are addressed. Those with successful claims will begin receiving payments in mid-2011.</p>

		<p>This is another GIANT RIPOFF by &#8220;black farmers&#8221;, many of whom have never even seen a farm. This scam started out with 2500 &#8220;farmers&#8221; who alleged they were discriminated against when they tried to get farm loans from the USDA.  The USDA had no records of these people applying for loans so AG Secretary Dan Glickman and District Judge Paul Friedman, (Clinton&rsquo;s personal judge to handle stickey matters) decided to hand out $50,000 to almost everyone who filed a claim saying he had suffered racial discrimination.  &#8220;black farmers&#8221; who missed the cut off date lobbied for years for the flood gates to be reopened so thousands and thousands more &#8220;farmers&#8221; could get their $50,000 without having to anything. Now congress is about to authorize $1.15 billion so these &#8220;farmers&#8221; can get their $50,000 of the free taxpayer money.</p>

		<p>There will be more Black claimants than there are Black farmers.  And I seriously doubt that the Dept of Agriculture fought this case very hard.  </p>

		<p>Obama promised to transfer wealth from white people to blacks, its the only way because now hispanics have pulled ahead of blacks.  This explains why Michelle Obama planted a garden last summer, she is now a Black Farmer too and will receive her $50,000.</p>
<p>Whites need not apply.</p>

		<p>Wow!  What a giveaway.  We should be overjoyed that our tax dollars will be going to these oppressed farmers.  I wonder just how many black farmers we&rsquo;re talking about here.  I personally have never seen one and I&rsquo;ve visited 23 states in this here union.</p>

As I understand it, the reason for Pigford II is because too many black &#8216;farmers&rsquo; weren&rsquo;t aware of Pigford I.</p>
<p>This story is definitely under the radar as was the first suit.</p>
<p>This seems to be a catch-22. They have to keep the suit quiet because they know if they make it too public, they&rsquo;ll be flooded with claims for thousands of blacks. If they don&rsquo;t make it public and still more black &#8216;farmers&rsquo; are overlooked, there will likely be a Pigford III.</p>
<p>The discrimination case that just keeps giving.<br>

		<p>If I were to win $50,000 in a lottery, my &#8220;income bracket&#8221; would be automatically raised for that year.  The federal government would take roughly 35%, then my state would take god only know what.  Will this happen to the &#8220;farmers&#8221;?</p>

		<p>If you looked into the credit history of these &#8220;black farmers&#8221; you probably could see why they were denied the loans. </p>

		<p>This country is bankrupt, in dept up and past our eyeballs and the Justice Dept is giving away $1.25 Billion taxpayer dollars on one of the more transparent race hustles ever to come down the pike! This country is being destroyed from the inside out, and we have people, media, etc., who carry on incessantly about Muslim boogeymen as the greatest threat extant!! Unreal!</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t farm.  The farms that get taken over in South Africa and Zimbabwe are not given to black farmers, because black men do not farm (unless it&rsquo;s at the point of a whip). </p>
<p>There are no black farmers in America, either. </p>

<p>Black farmers able to demonstrate they suffered from discrimination would get up to $50,000 and debt relief.<br>
</p>
<p>This is supposed to convince me that this <b>isn&rsquo;t</b> extortion? People are actually going to DENY invalid claims? <br>

		<p>I live in a rural area of Ohio and have a small family farm. I have known one black farmer, now retired. I&rsquo;ve been trying for two years to get the U.S.D.A. to issue me a permit and Certification number to sell my eggs at the local farmer&rsquo;s market. After calling several time and being ignored, I have given up and have sought other venues.Of course, I am white and speak clear English on the telephone. This fact may have some bearing on my situation.I have found that all the bureaus we have to deal with are run by &#8221; the disadvantaged &#8221; and are biased against white people. I am also sure the black &#8221; farmers &#8221; in this issue will probably out number the 1% of the nation that are farmers.</p>

		<p>   I grew up on a dairy farm.  We had about a hundred acres in hay. Every time we baled hay my dad or uncle would contact the work-release program of the local prison to get help with the manual labor&hellip; which was brutal, hot, tiring, dirty, WORK.  A van would come by around 8:00 a.m. (when we were already two hours in to the work) and drop off a few men.  ALL of the black ones (and a few of the whites too) would give up by lunchtime feigning injury or just ignoring you and refusing to work any more.</p>
<p>     These men, if they would work, got four days off their sentence for every day they worked.  I soon learned two things.  First, at 14 years and 130 lbs I could outwork any black I ever met no matter how big and muscular he might appear, and second, a black would rather sit in jail for a month than work for a week.</p>
<p>     Black farmers. A figment of the imagination.  I don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re supposedly keeping them, but they&rsquo;re not in Pennsylvania.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve hunted farms all over the northeast and in some southern states.  I&rsquo;ve never once seen or spoken with a black farmer in seeking permission to hunt on a farm.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;d concede that there probably are at least a few somewhere I&rsquo;d be surprised if their numbers exceeded more than a fraction of one percent of the total.  I&rsquo;d be even more surprised if this tiny number suffered any sort of discrimination from federal bureaucrats, who normally would have no way of knowing the race of the farmers applying for whatever it was they were seeking.</p>
<p>This sounds like a pure scam for the benefit of black scammers.</p>

		<p>Sorry gentlemen, but yes, there are black farmers, several are in my area, mostly small operators. I seriously doubt that any were ever denied any kind of government assistance on account of race, since no person, or agency, would dare deny them due to litigation dangers. However the mere mention of skin color sends shivers of fear up the spine of most. Secondly, if anyone believes blacks are more dangerous than muslims, then they are insane. Blacks hate us, but they know they need us, on the other hand, muslims hate us, and intend to make us all dead. Read their rule book. </p>

		<p>Our government&rsquo;s main purpose is to transfer large amounts of money form productive people to non-productive people.  No matter how long it takes or how much of your money it takes, our government will continue to take money from your family and give it to people who will fail generation after generation after generation.  </p>
<p>This re-distrubution game will continue until there are simply too few productive people left in the USA, then we will have Haiti.  It is already happening in California.  </p>

		<p>For more on this see the short but incredible book &#8220;Harvest of Lies: The Black Farmer Lawsuit Against the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8221; by Louis T. March.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing how blatantly corrupt the ongoing shakedown is, and this book documents it all.  With each new Administration, the hustle renews, and presidents tell their Ag Secretaries to do whatever it takes to make the fuss go away.  Meaning more of your money and mine being showered on liars, who are lionized as courageous victims.</p>
