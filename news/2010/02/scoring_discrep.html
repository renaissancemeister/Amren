<h1>Scoring Discrepancy Changes Results of Sprite Step Off</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nedra Rhone, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five days after taking first place in the Sprite Step Off finals in Atlanta last weekend, the women of Zeta Tau Alpha&rsquo;s Epsilon Chapter from the University of Arkansas learned they would be sharing the spotlight.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company, which sponsors the college step dancing competition, announced that because of a scoring discrepancy in the sorority results, the second-place winners, the Tau Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc. from Indiana University, would be recognized as co-winners and awarded the same $100,000 prize as Zeta Tau Alpha.</p>
<p>The change was revealed in a Facebook statement. It did not offer insight into the exact problem with the scoring or how it was discovered. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The announcement came after four days of blog posts and YouTube comments alternating between support for Zeta Tau Alpha&rsquo;s win and those doubting the competition results.</p>
<p>Zeta Tau Alpha is a predominantly white organization, which took first place in a tradition that has historically been dominated by African-American fraternities and sororities. Its winning eight-minute Matrix themed production got more than 200,000 views on YouTube, more than twice as many as the second- or third-place winners.</p>
<p>Anthony Antoine, 40, of Atlanta, who posted the popular YouTube video, said he was shocked when he received more than 1,000 comments on the post  &mdash;  many focused on race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line was they didn&rsquo;t care if the girls were better or not, the people that were upset were saying white girls should not have won, period,&#8221; Antoine said. &#8220;I think this is bigger than a step competition. Race relations in America still needs a lot of work,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After learning they would be co-winners in the competition, Kosmitis said the nine-member step team remained grateful. &#8220;We are just keeping a positive attitude about it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are excited to still have $100,000 for our scholarships and we are excited that someone else can have some money to help them out as well.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Disco was largely a black genre of music, but if you pressed the average person to name a disco artist, they would likely rattle off the Bee Gees.  Even though Saturday Night Fever was the Gees&rsquo;s only disco album.  Hip-Hop is almost entirely black, but Eminem holds many sales and awards records, and, in spite of stiff competition, is probably the most visible hip-hopper out there.  I understand that a very high percentage, if not a majority, of degrees, both undergrad and graduate, awarded in black studies/history are to whites.</p>
<p>Even when blacks dominate something, whites rise to the top.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch&rsquo;s race blog covered this story today, and polled its readers on whether Coca-Cola did the right thing.  96% said no, and mind you it&rsquo;s a liberal blog aimed at liberal readers.</p>

		<p>  The elite liberals know that if their idea that whites can  never really &#8220;earn&#8221; prestige is to sink into the framework of American consciousness, just like the &#8220;Lincoln saved the union&#8221; myth has, then whites must never be allowed to win competitions against blacks when merit is the deciding factor.</p>
<p>Whites who win competitions will be less willing to acknowledge their unearned white privilege to blacks as the means to Eracism. Their innate white self worth become obstacles to afrovoodoo total rule.</p>
<p>Whites must constantly be critical of their whiteness for the afrovoodoo thugocracy to advance, and big corporations like Coke are full of Diversity employees and consultants who tell them what they must do in order to avoid the next boycott or civil rights lawsuit.  Coke is nearly run by the Diversity and is beholden to the blacks in Atlanta for everything it does. </p>
<p>Now the U.S. military is the same. On army bases, you see mulatto children running around everywhere.  Integration of the military has meant complete mongrelization of the bloodlines the working portion of the white lower class.</p>
<p>Black Equality and Multicultural Diversity are scams and shakedowns. This system won&rsquo;t last. The pieces of the &#8220;union&#8221; that Lincoln &#8220;saved&#8221; are going to come flying apart on ethnic and racial tensions, just as they should.  </p>

		<p>Greek campus organizations are discriminatory right from the gitgo - vis a vis &#8220;rush week&#8221;   &mdash;   each group picks the people they want from the whole group of &#8220;rushees.&#8221;  If blacks want equality, they shouldn&rsquo;t be involved with the stupid Greek groups in the first place; in the second place, losing is part of equality - so blacks better learn how to lose and accept it gracefully.  In other words, grow up and get over it!</p>

Since the videos were shot differently, it&rsquo;s difficult to compare. However, from the crowd reaction, I believe Zeta was the crowd favorite.</p>

		<p>So, if there&rsquo;s an ballroom dancing competition, and a black team gets first while a white team gets second, what will happen?  I suppose they&rsquo;ll award bonus points to the white team, to make it a tie?  After all, it&rsquo;s traditionally a white thing.</p>
<p>On another note, does anyone else think it&rsquo;s sad that blacks need affirmative action, even on events that are offshoots of their culture?</p>

<p>Indeed. Nothing makes blacks angrier than when whites handle them at &#8220;their&#8221; specialties such as basketball, sprinting, rapping, stepping ..etc.</p>
<p>A decade ago I would have added boxing to this list but almost all the champs now are white or Hispanic.</p>

<p>And most, if not all, are living with their SINGLE WHITE military mothers on base/camp. Military service for many White girls is just joining the &#8220;sleep with blacks club&#8221; and black women get treated like cattle. An attractive black woman (and there are many) simply cannot eat, work or shop without being pawed by every black male that walks by her, and I see the proof of this every day and night. White girls are simply avoiding being called RACISSSSSS which many fear more than illigitimate pregnancy by blacks with all the attendant problems.</p>

		<p>There is no greater and more obvious hypocrisy in the modern socio-racial continuum, than that of Blacks who want always to retain exclusively what is historically &#8220;theirs,&#8221; yet they must have 100% access, even domination of what is anyone else&rsquo;s(read -what belongs to Whites), else it be condemned as foulest bigotry, etc! This ludicrous double-standard is now so deeply entrenched in American popular culture, most hardly give it a second though, despite its nakedly racist implications. How remarkable it is that when the racial shoe is on the other foot, there is no outrage, no offense, no anger - only meek acquiescense. So sad, so typical. </p>

		<p>When you compare white and black cheerleading squads, you see more synchronization and discipline among the white girls.  The black girls usually look very sassy and barely able to stand having to stay in the routine.  Each one looks like she wants to bust out of the choreography and start a pole dance or something.  Go on youtube and look up both kinds and watch a few, then you&rsquo;ll see the difference.</p>
