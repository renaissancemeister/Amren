<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The oversexed siren and the asexual, overweight Mammy are among the dominant caricatures of Black women, according to Tom Burrell, one of the most successful &#8216;ad men&rsquo; in modern history and author of an explosive new book.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2004, Burrell announced his retirement from Burrell Communications Group.  Today he&rsquo;s rewired  &mdash;  having released a riveting new book, Brainwashed: Challenging the Myth of Black Inferiority (SmileyBooks, February, 2010), which no advertising exec would want the urban consumer to read.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Two Black Women: the Mammy &amp; the Siren</b></p>
<p>The oversexed siren and the asexual, overweight Mammy are among the dominant caricatures of Black women, according to Tom Burrell, one of the most successful &#8216;ad men&rsquo; in modern history.</p>
<p>Of the two, the Mammy is especially controversial.</p>
<p>Aunt Jemima (portrayed by Nancy Green, a bandana-wearing, full-figured black cook), made her world debut in Chicago, at the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893. Green happily flipped pancakes with the new self-rising flour, as she told cheery down-home stories.</p>
<p>Fast forward.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1939, 20th century Confederates packed Atlanta&rsquo;s Loew&rsquo;s Grand Theater for the world premiere of the civil war saga, Gone With the Wind, where another Mammy would make her debut. Hattie McDaniel, who made history as the first African American woman to win an Academy Award for her portrayal of the doting Mammy in the film, wasn&rsquo;t invited to the premiere. But her presence was felt  &mdash;  while Atlanta&rsquo;s Big Bethel choir, clad in costumes of the old South, serenaded Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh with Black spirituals, the Atlanta black press pounced on McDaniel for her role in the film.</p>
<p>Fast forward.</p>
<p>Decades later, Aunt Jemima and Mammy remain sore spots for many black women  &mdash;  fueling the complicated, yet blossoming underground resistance to Precious. Translation: It&rsquo;s beautiful that Gabourey Sidibe can be the face of self-acceptance and self love; it&rsquo;s tragic that her spring board is the ghetto tale, Precious.</p>
<p>Writes NY Press film critic Armond White, &#8220;Not since The Birth of a Nation has a mainstream movie demeaned the idea of black American life as much as Precious. Full of brazenly racist clich√©s (Precious steals and eats an entire bucket of fried chicken), it is a sociological horror show.&#8221;</p>

<p>African-American Film Critics Association Selects &#8220;Precious&#8221; As Top Film of 2009</p>
<p>Organization Will Present Awards at First Annual Live Event</p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA (December 14, 2009)  &mdash;  The African-American Film Critics Association (AAFCA) has named &#8220;Precious&#8221; as the Best Picture of 2009. Directed by Lee Daniels, the Lionsgate release captured a majority vote by the organization, which is comprised of African-American media professionals from across the nation. Founded in 2003, the organization will present this year&rsquo;s honors at its first live event tonight, Monday, December 14, 2009, at the historic Ebony Repertory Theatre in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Morgan Freeman was selected as Best Actor 2009 for &#8220;Invictus.&#8221; Nicole Beharie earned AAFCA recognition as Best Actress 2009 for &#8220;American Violet.&#8221; With the first unanimous vote in an acting category in the organization&rsquo;s history, Mo&rsquo;Nique was selected Best Supporting Actress for &#8220;Precious.&#8221; Anthony Mackie earned Best Supporting Actor recognition for his performance in &#8220;The Hurt Locker.&#8221; Lee Daniels was named Best Director for &#8220;Precious,&#8221; with a tie for Best Screenplay between Ron Clements, Rob Edwards, John Musker for &#8220;The Princess &amp; The Frog&#8221; and Geoffrey Fletcher for &#8220;Precious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2009, the film community produced a dazzling array of performances from African-American talent both in front of and behind the camera,&#8221; states Gil Robertson IV, AAFCA Co-Founder. &#8220;This year&rsquo;s selections give a strong indication that the film community is becoming more committed to a wider range of stories that entertain and educate.&#8221;</p>
<p>AAFCA bestows Special Achievement Award to Michael Jackson, whose seminal film &#8220;This Is It&#8221; captured a lifetime of exemplary creative expression.</p>
<p>The organization&rsquo;s Top Ten list of film honors includes &#8220;Up In The Air,&#8221; &#8220;The Hurt Locker&#8221; and &#8220;Good Hair.&#8221; &#8220;The films selected for 2009 reflect a fascinating combination of work that both entertains and addresses themes and issues of cultural importance,&#8221; remarks AAFCA President, Wilson Morales, editor of Blackfilm.com.</p>

		<p>Odd&hellip;though I naturally didn&rsquo;t go see the movie, just from the previews and hype discussion about it, I thought that this &#8220;Precious&#8221; film was one they finally got somewhat close to reality!</p>
<p>&#8220;Caricature and stereotype?&#8221; Seriously? This from the race who positively wallow in and celebrate all manner of stereotypes and caricatures - &#8220;pimps, ho&rsquo;s, thugs, gang-bangers,&#8221; etc&hellip;Blacks identify with these ghetto caricatures far more than they do any more civilized White socio-types.   </p>

		<p>What about &#8220;The Klumps&#8221; and &#8220;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&#8221; that blacks stand in line to see and most Whites avoid?  What do those films do for the image of a the &#8220;African American&#8221; woman? I would imagine that all of their &#8220;barber&#8221; and &#8220;beauty shop&#8221; movies aren&rsquo;t much different from the advertisements I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Precious steals and eats an entire bucket of fried chicken)&#8221; Is this really stereotyping? Didn&rsquo;t Oprah offer free KFC meals to all her guests not all that long ago?  And who do you think showed up to get them?</p>

As always, you can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Show blacks as they are and it&rsquo;s denounced as a racist stereotype. Portray blacks as anything else, and you&rsquo;re not &#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real&rsquo;.</p>
<p>By the way, after all they hype, &#8220;The Princess Frog&#8221; appears to have been a dud. I haven&rsquo;t seen any little girls, black or white, sporting Princess Frog togs.<br>

		<p>I saw Precious and the black racists are actually half right on this one. Every sick, twisted person in the film is black while the heroes (and saviors of Precious)are either whites or mulattoes (Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz among them).</p>
<p>When I was in grad school I lived in an all-black neighborhood in DC and the scenes in Precious are similar to what I saw around me at the time.</p>

<p>Can anyone point to a modern depiction of the &#8220;Mammy&#8221; or the &#8220;oversexed siren&#8221; in advertising? These things would simply not be allowed if they were portrayed by blacks. </p>
<p>That is why all the criminals on TV are white. </p>

		<p>Seriously, who cares about these nonsense films? I&rsquo;ve seen some ads for &#8220;Precious&#8221; - it looks like the local TV news with music. Last I checked it was (more or less) a free country. If you don&rsquo;t like the film then don&rsquo;t support it or buy it or rent it. Whoever Zondra is - Zondra needs to be reminded that the government does not make movies. It seems that since so many blacks get everything from the government they must figure that movies come from the same office where they make food stamps. So by complaining then the government will make different films which show blacks inventing space travel and brain surgery. Stop complaining already. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing it. No one is listening anymore. If you don&rsquo;t like the films then make your own movies. I&rsquo;m sure the government will give you a grant to buy a camera and hire some actors. </p>

<p>===========</p>
<p>The Princess and the frog was a very sucessful BLACK MOVIE<br>
just grossing over 100 million dollars world wide in the theaters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=princessandthefrog.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=princessandthefrog.htm</a></p>
<p>While this seems like a lot compared to disneys&rsquo;s reccent animated works not specifially aimed at a black auidenice those numbers are outright catastrophic.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2009 Disney&rsquo;s &#8220;UP&#8221; grossed 700 million worldwide, </p>
<p><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=up.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=up.htm</a></p>
<p>last year&rsquo;s Wall-E raked in over over 500.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wall-e.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wall-e.htm</a></p>
<p><br>
In otherwords the princess and the frog did about as good as any black movie can do, but utterly failed to win over any white support. </p>
<p>The movie got across the board good reviews and presumably would have put up decent numbers assuming comparable to Disney&rsquo;s other pictures assuming they had a white princess. Disney basically flushed half a billion dollars down the drain on this social experiment not counting of course merchandise, spin offs, etc. and barely managed to break even just clearing the 100+million dollar budget. </p>
<p>I guess as long as their &#8220;normal&#8221; movies continue to make boatloads of cash, Disney can continue to fund their multicultural propaganda works.</p>

		<p>Up In The Air was pretty good, actually. Really. But I hope Precious wins, though, just because the Academy&rsquo;s purely ideological voting amuses me. And it prompts the media to divulge their blatant double standards as well.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal, folks: if blacks are involved in the creation of the flick, then anything goes.  I foolishly got Miracle at St. Anna from the library, thinking that  &mdash;  even if directed by Spike Lee  &mdash;  it might have some uplifting message.  Silly me.  The movie was full of such stereotypes as a whimpering black cowardly soldier, a black buffoon, an oversexed, white-girl-chasing hustler, etc.  And there wasn&rsquo;t a hint of satire, as in Lee&rsquo;s Bamboozled.  I could only imagine that Lee made the whole mess in order to dare white critics to challenge him.  If a white had created the film, he would have been banished from Hollywood forever.</p>

		<p>Blacks complain all the time.  If you portray them as nice, family types (like Bill Cosby Show) or as happy, they&rsquo;ll say &#8220;you&rsquo;re not showing how we really are.&#8221;  BUT when blacks are portrayed as gangsters and down and trodden, they will still complain.  Blacks are hard to read.  Damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t when it comes to blacks.</p>

<p><i>What about &ldquo;The Klumps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diary of a Mad Black Woman&rdquo; that blacks stand in line to see and most Whites avoid? What do those films do for the image of a the &ldquo;African American&rdquo; woman?</i></p>
<p>Other than it seems remarkably easy for them to be portrayed on screen by men, not much, I suppose.</p>
<p><i>I would imagine that all of their &ldquo;barber&rdquo; and &ldquo;beauty shop&rdquo; movies aren&rsquo;t much different from the advertisements I&rsquo;ve seen.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the <i>Beauty Shop</i> movie, but the first <i>Barber Shop</i> was actually pretty good. I would have never had any interest in it if I hadn&rsquo;t heard Jesse Jackson on the radio railing against it for, of all things, challenging the Rosa Parks myth. Turns out they did just that in one scene, and also hit on other less-than-pleasant aspects of black culture, which prompted ire from other professional black whiners. </p>
<p>It gets the BW Sam seal of approval.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the films on this list, I dunno. I&rsquo;m not much of a movie buff. I&rsquo;ve never even heard of this <i>Precious</i>. <i>Up</i> was a good film in it&rsquo;s own right. I also saw some trailers for <i>Good Hair</i>, Chris Rock&rsquo;s documentary on the black hair industry. It looks interesting. See if you agree.</p>
