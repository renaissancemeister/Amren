<h1>Is Racism a Mental Disorder?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Angie Meus, The Famuan (Florida A&M; University), February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Can racism be tied to something deeper than a difference in skin tone, perhaps, a mental illness?</p>
<p>The issue was first raised 40 years ago by a group of black psychiatrists who asked the American Psychiatric Association to classify forms of extreme bigotry and prejudice as a mental disorder.</p>
<p>The APA rejected their request on the grounds that racism is a &#8220;cultural and social problem and cannot be attributed to any disorder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The APA also said that labeling racism as a mental illness will not do anything to rid society of the problem and doing so will carry too many political implications. This has remained the general consensus.</p>
<p>Recently, some psychiatrists argue that the notion deserves a second look. &#8220;To continue perceiving extreme racism as normative and not pathologic is to lend it legitimacy. Clearly, anyone who scapegoats a whole group of people and seeks to eliminate them to resolve his or her internal conflicts meets criteria for a delusional disorder, a major psychiatric illness,&#8221; said Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Not recognizing racism as a mental illness seems to legitimize it. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, a mental disorder is defined as a behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.</p>
<p>The manual also goes on to say that in order for a syndrome to be classified as a mental illness it must be considered a manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the individual. Neither deviant behavior nor conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is time for the APA to reevaluate the seriousness of racism.<br/>

		<p>When I was a kid, &#8220;racism&#8221; was generally associated with prejudice and ignorance.  Disliking a group with whom one has had no contact is prejudice from ignorance.  Having negative views because of experience is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>Someone should find research linking negative views to amount of contact.  If it can be shown that as contact goes up, opinions go down, that should refute the notion of prejudice.<br/>

<p>This is a tactic right out of the Soviet show trials of the 1920s and 1930s.  The kulaks and other &#8220;wreckers&#8221; were accused of suffering from some sort of mental illness if they did not accept the communist order.  </p>

		<p>Blacks, and black apologists, will desperately grasp at ANY straw however draconian, ridiculous, or oppressive rather than just simply CLEAN UP THEIR ACT AND BEHAVE.<br/>
As it was said, the more contact non-black races have with blacks, the more a valid negative opinion of them is formed.  The more we pander to them, engage in apologetics for them, throw money and programs at them, and dream up myriad excuses for their unruly, violent, ignorant, hateful and savage behavior, the more we ensure those behaviors will continue.  In fact, civilization around them suffers whether we pander to them and try to lift them up, or just separate and leave them to their own devices.  After 2000 years of empirical observation we can pretty safely say they are a savage people without an iota of what Europeans possess: an inherent drive to establish civilized and prosperous cultures.</p>

		<p>The American Psychiatric Association has zero credibility, since it has been exposed as rendering decision not based on fact but politics.</p>
<p>It is a dark day when the field of medicine and science falls into the camp of the propagandists.</p>
<p>Liberalism is a mental disorder, which has been logically, persuasively suported by reputable psychiatrists.  Can we now expect the APA to come out in support of that contention?</p>
<p>I think not, and the readon is that many of these people are mentally ill themselves.</p>
<p>Our dysfunctional empire is spiraling down rapidly into an abyss.</p>

		<p>The mental disorder is when one rejects the plainly obvious and overwhelming evidence for an unsupported position that is contrary to it. People who do this are just letting their emotions override their intellect. They let their personal wants dictate what they believe to be true or false and it&rsquo;s both intellectually dishonest and delusional to do that. One should not determine what is believed to be true or false depending on whether the belief is appealing or not and that is exactly what the egalitarians are doing which is why they will get so furious when faced with the truth of the matter. Deep down they know they are clinging to an illusion and they don&rsquo;t like being reminded of that.</p>

		<p>The term racism is so widely overused that you would have to first define what the term means.  </p>
<p>If a teacher segregates the fast learners from the slower learners and in doing so unintentionally segregates somewhat along race, is that racism?  </p>
<p>If a principal suspends more blacks than whites, is that racism?</p>
<p>If a police officer arrests more blacks than whites, is that racism?  </p>
<p>If a person wants to live among those of his own race, is that racism?  </p>
<p>Many liberals would answer yes to those questions, and now you see the problem.</p>

		<p>Well, the good news is, the DSM book is inclusive of people of ALL races - so, racism would have to be defined as something that applies to ALL people, not just whites.  To define it as a &#8220;white disease&#8221; would be to make the definition invalid, since there is no such thing as a mental illness that affects one race exclusively.  So I say bring it on - finally blacks will have to admit that they can be just as racist as whites.  AMEN to that!</p>

		<p>No surprise with any of this. The psychiatrist is one of the West&rsquo;s most important jailers. Charges of emotional and/or mental illness can go along way to silence an enemy, as it did in the old Soviet Union. White racism has been branded a great moral evil by the left. Those who deviate from this position are &#8220;sick&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary thing to think that definitions of &#8220;mental illness&#8221; can be filtered through a society&rsquo;s dominant ideology.</p>

		<p>Of course it&rsquo;s a mental disorder. The black African chiefs who sold away blacks from Africa were racists and wanted fewer blacks in Africa. If they had been mentally correct, they would have wanted to surround themselves with as many blacks as possible.</p>
<p>We are told to do surround ourselves with blacks, but those whites who tell us to do it don&rsquo;t move themselves in mass to black neighborhoods, so the do have a mental disorder, and we shouldn&rsquo;t feel any need to obey them, only to study them.</p>

		<p>Three points:</p>
<p>1. How can &#8220;racism&#8221; be a mental illness when the definition keeps changing? It used to mean hatred of other races; now it means anyone who opposes slave reparations, open-borders immigration, busing, interracial dating, etc.</p>
<p>2. When the black militants demanded years ago that racism be declared a mental disease perhaps the APA should have agreed and immediately sought a court order to institutionalize Farrakhan, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, etc. </p>
<p>3. Until recently the APA claimed (wrongly, in my view) that homosexuality was a mental illness and some atheists feel the same about those who believe in God. But radio host Michael Savage had it right when he said &#8220;Liberalism is a mental disease&#8221;.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this interesting! A &#8220;group of black psychiatrists&#8221; wanted to classify &#8220;racism&#8221; as a mental disorder! Does anyone think for a moment they did so out of love and concern for those they consider to be &#8220;racist?&#8221; Of course not! They did so to make it easier to demonize and lock up those they oppose! After all, have you ever heard of a black psychiatrist (or any blacks for that matter) say that we must have sympathy and understanding for &#8220;racists,&#8221; that, after all, they are merely victims of a bad upbringing? Never! No one ever makes &#8220;root cause&#8221; excuses for racism! It is always seen as an unmitigated evil! Society talks about muggers and rapists as being the victims of their poor upbringing (and therefore deserving of leniency) but never &#8220;racists!&#8221; This action by the black psychiatrists was not an act of sympathy and caring for those they saw as misguided but instead an act of hostility and hatred.</p>

		<p>the pharma firms are looking for new reasons to drug people, and diagnosing people as racist would be a major source of revenue, since all humans without excetions are prejudiced in favor of their own race, whether they admit it or not (your genes make you feel this way, its nothing personal).</p>
<p>A delusion is a false belief - like thinking you are a kangaroo or a martian.</p>

		<p>This is scary because it is one more way to relieve us of the means of protecting ourselves. </p>
<p>1.) A person with a mental disorder cannot legally own a gun.<br/>
2.) Racism is a mental disorder.<br/>
3.) Study proves white babies as young as 6 months old are racist.<br/>
4.) Since ALL white people have this mental disorder of &#8220;Racism&#8221;, they must be prevented from owning guns for self-protection from the robbing, raping, murdering swarms of non-whites who would love nothing better than to annihilate us.</p>

		<p>I would say that given the fact that the races have been drawing boundaries between one another since the beginning of time, that makes the desire and decision to draw boundaries a natural, normal and psychologically healthy reflexes. It is the desire to remove boundaries to promote diversity that is the sign of defective mental health. When making important societal decisions, mentally healthy peoples consider what impacts those decisions will have on their progeny. In our twisted society, liberals place a higher value on perceiving themselves as moral, intelligent, progressive and open-minded than they do on the future well-being of their children and their children&rsquo;s children.</p>

<p>If we can&rsquo;t demonstrate that we have lots of very close friends who are Blacks (or Mexicans) we&rsquo;re called &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The APA has a tendency to mix real medical science and politics, I would say.</p>
<p>I think it was in the early 1980&rsquo;s, when the APA decided that homosexuality, which had previously been described (by the APA) as a mental disorder, no longer was one&hellip; The APA made that change, not after some brand new scientific or medical discovery, but after years of being under pressure by the gay lobby in the United States!</p>
<p>I believe that the day when a professionnal association of doctors decides to mix medicine and medical standards, with contemporary politics, is a dark day indeed!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? If someone becomes racist towards Latinos because he was attacked by members of a Mexican-American street gang, the APA are going to declare that person is totally psychotic and should be put away, in a psychiatric hospital?</p>

		<p>This was somewhat inevitable. Consider how in the USSR dissidents were sent to insane asylums. How can anyone sane be against the workers&rsquo; paradise? We see the same thing today, where &#8220;racism&#8221; (an ill-defined word, by the way) has become a sign of being the deviant who must be removed from the community. </p>
<p>Of course, the difference is that the USA claims to be a tolerant society in which dissent is allowed, though we can see the reality in the suppression of any kind of serious genetic study of racial characteristics. But all this goes to indicate that the civil rights struggle was, in the end, not about civil rights but entrenching the power of the PC branch of liberalism, giving them police-state powers (and let us note that mainstream conservatism has done nothing to stop this trend). </p>
<p>In the bigger picture, since most people historically have been &#8220;racist,&#8221; does this mean that the world has been insane until the multicult brought sanity to this benighted planet? Is multicultism a new form of religion in which the heretics are to be sent to asylums for reprogramming? Is this part of a bigger project to remake the world?</p>
<p>More likely, this is simply one more symptom of the decline of the West. Since the vast majority of third worlders, and a lot of second worlders, still function according to the racial model, they will have the inevitable advantage in future struggles.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Does that mean that you regard stereotypes against whites, that are held by non-whites, to be true? Anti-white activists can easily come up with certain behavior by white people in the past 500 years, to justify their stereotypes. I judge people as individuals, not as members of a group.</p>
<p>I however reject attempts to classify racialism as a &#8220;mental disorder&#8221;, given the abuse of dissidents by psychiatrists in the former Soviet Union. America should not adopt Soviet tactics.<br/>
