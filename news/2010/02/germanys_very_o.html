<h1><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676156,00.html">Germany&rsquo;s Very Own Minaret Debate Turns Nasty</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CGH, Spiegel, February 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small Muslim community in a western German town would like to build a minaret on its mosque. But the plan has triggered passionate opposition from locals, many of whom rely on rhetoric from the extreme right in railing against the &#8220;symbol of Islam&rsquo;s quest for power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Willkommen,&#8221; reads the stencilled print on the wall along the riverside boardwalk in the small town of Völklingen. Not content to just welcome its German guests, however, the message is translated into a number of languages. &#8220;Bienvenue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bienvenidos .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. velkommen,&#8221; it reads. And &#8220;hosgeldiniz,&#8221; a nod to the city&rsquo;s substantial Turkish population.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the city  &mdash;  particularly in the quarter known as Wehrden  &mdash;  Muslim immigrants may not feel quite as welcome. A small mosque on the banks of the Saar River there has applied for a permit to build a small minaret on its roof  &mdash;  triggering a wave of at-times vehement protest reminiscent of the fuss surrounding the November 2009 referendum in Switzerland to ban minarets in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am against the Islamification of our fatherland!&#8221; reads a message, posted by &#8220;Tommy&#8221; on the Web site of the local paper Saarbrücker Zeitung. &#8220;Islam is the greatest threat facing humanity,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>In a town meeting held on the subject in late January, a number of locals came out against the minaret plan. According to Berlin daily Die Tageszeitung, several expressed fears that Germany was being &#8220;infiltrated&#8221; by &#8220;the Turks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan foresees a minaret stretching a mere eight meters (26 feet) above the roof. The head of the Turkish-Muslim community planning the minaret, Adnan Atakli, has assured locals that there are no plans to broadcast calls to prayer from the minaret and that he merely sees it as an &#8220;ornament.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Doesn&rsquo;t Shy Away from Far-Right Rhetoric</b></p>
<p>And not everyone has come out against the plans. Many have pointed out that such an adornment would only improve the not-terribly-attractive quarter where the mosque is located. Furthermore, almost 10 percent of the Völklingen population is made up of immigrants, many of them Muslims. Some say it only makes sense that they be allowed to build a small minaret.</p>
<p>Still, politesse has hardly characterized the debate in Völklingen. Indeed, the back and forth is reminiscent of the campaign in Cologne in 2008 to block the construction of a mosque there. The campaign was led by a group called Pro-Cologne, a group that doesn&rsquo;t shy away from far-right rhetoric. Similar debates have taken place in numerous European countries as the right wing seeks to tap into widespread skepticism toward Islam.</p>
<p>The Swiss referendum, which saw 57.5 percent of voters come out against the minaret ban, clearly showed just how anchored anti-Muslim sentiment may be in Europe. Indeed, a group called Pro-NRW (short for the German state North Rhine-Westphalia) now plans to cooperate with right-wing political parties in numerous European countries to organize a European Union-wide minaret referendum.</p>
<p><b>Islam&rsquo;s &#8216;Quest for Power&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The debate in Völklingen is once again showing how quickly right-wing rhetoric can cross over into the mainstream when it comes to debates on Islam in Europe. Local right-wing extremists  &mdash;  two of whom are in the Völklingen city council  &mdash;  have argued that minarets are &#8220;symbols of Turkish dominance.&#8221; They point to a speech given by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in February 2008 in Cologne. In it, he said that &#8220;mosques are our barracks, minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers are our soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Völklingen mosque belongs to the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB), which has close ties to Turkey. &#8220;We are being quietly infiltrated by the Turks!&#8221; said one participant at the late January town meeting, according to Die Tageszeitung.</p>
<p>The local news paper, however, has used the exact same rhetoric on its editorial pages. &#8220;This minaret should not be built,&#8221; the Saarbrücker Zeitung wrote in late January. &#8220;It symbolizes Islam&rsquo;s quest for power and is nothing less than a provocation. In the course of the Muslim conquests, minarets were first used as watch towers and only subsequently as religious symbols. Following the violent seizure of new territories, minarets were built as manifestations of Muslim rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minaret opponents are now looking into the possibility of holding a referendum on the issue in Völklingen. Yet another one.<br>

		<p>Adnan Atakli, has assured locals that there are no plans to broadcast calls to prayer from the minaret and that he merely sees it as an &ldquo;ornament.&rdquo;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Then what is the PURPOSE of it?   I don&rsquo;t believe it is for &#8220;ornament&#8221; only.   That&rsquo;s just a way of slipping a foot in the door.  Eventually, given time, nibble by nibble, they will want to broadcast calls to prayer. That&rsquo;s what a minaret is for.</p>
<p>I can say as one who knows, that this is one of the greatest annoyances in a Moslem country.  Yes, you can say that Christian countries have their church bells, but they&rsquo;re not the same as the call of the muezzin waking the city up at the crack of dawn, and then broadcasting at various intervals throughout the day.</p>
<p>It served a purpose for desert tribes and before people had clocks.  It&rsquo;s need is outmoded today. </p>

		<p>Right Comrade Invader Atakli, that is until maybe 2012 or 2013 when you start demanding &ldquo;calls to prayer&rdquo; as your &ldquo;human&rdquo; or &ldquo;religious&rdquo; rights in the next phase of your &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; into German culture!</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>
<p>The poster to the Saarbrücker Zeitung&rsquo;s website named Tommy is quite correct when he wisely declares: &ldquo;Islam is the greatest threat facing humanity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We have been at war with, and defending ourselves against, being enslaved and brutalized by Islam for centuries in the West. What makes anyone, except for the most infinitely odious of &ldquo;enlightened intellectuals,&rdquo; think that anything has changed in this historical dynamic? It hasn&rsquo;t, and to make matters worse, they of that &ldquo;religion of peace&rdquo; are openly stating that it hasn&rsquo;t for them at all.</p>
<p>Their goals are for conquest and &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; upon the Western &ldquo;whoredom,&rdquo; that they see as their nearest and most natural enemy.</p>
<p>What is so &ldquo;unfathomably&rdquo; hard to grasp about this:</p>

		<p>Is this the infiltration of &#8216;old style right wing rhetoric&rsquo;, or is it simply the young, taking a page from the very playbook of the multiculturalists, and marxists, learned and active and prevelant as they are; is this fighting fire with fire, so to speak?</p>
<p>That one is considered hate and the other enlightenment says more about the Spiegel than it does about these extreme rightists. </p>

		<p>Germany, one of the great nations of the world, is truly losing it. I have a buddy that does business( antique pianos)in Berlin,Germany,and he likes to go to the classical music concerts there. He once told me, Bob, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how families would go to these concerts with their elementary school aged kids and the kids would sit quietly and listen. He is just about ready to leave California for good.  However,he always says that the ultra liberal mind set there, that he has observed talking to the average German, is probably going to ruin the country. </p>

		<p>&#8220;a Mere 8 meters&hellip;&#8221; Or as the article pointed out, 26 feet. That`s a good ways above the roof line. Ask anyone who changes stadium and parking lot lights for a living.</p>

		<p>The Turkish immigrant population in Western Europe is mainly of rural Anatolian origin.</p>
<p>In Turkey, they support religious-reactionary parties. In Europe, however, they are quietly advised to join liberal-left parties and do their best to seem humble - and, ideally, &#8220;oppressed&#8221; - immigrants, victims of dicrimination.</p>
<p>One seemingly-modest demand follows another.</p>
<p>Islam, coupled with the Muslim immigrant birthrate, is the greatest threat to Western Civilization.</p>
<p>A small minaret now. A bigger one later. A quiet call to prayer now and a louder one later.</p>

<p>Oh those &#8220;nasty&#8221; Germans and other white Christian Europeans who won&rsquo;t let the nice brown Muslims build their beautiful minarets! As Der Spiegel takes pains to tell us, the Islamic community in this part of Germany is &#8220;small&#8221; and all they ask is for a minaret of &#8220;only&#8221; 26 feet.</p>
<p>So what happens in 10 years if the town&rsquo;s Muslim population has hit 20%? Won&rsquo;t that entitle them to a minaret of over 50 feet? </p>
<p>And what if in 30 years the Muslimss are 40%? Wouldn&rsquo;t that entitle them to a minaret of over 100 feet? </p>
<p>And if the Muslim population ever hits 50% then they&rsquo;ll just build their minarets as high as they want. By then it won&rsquo;t matter as it will be all over for Germany anyway. </p>
<p>Which is precisely why these currently &#8220;reasonable&#8221; requests for &#8220;small&#8221; minarets must be rejected. This nonsense needs to be nipped in the bud. Just say no to Islamization. </p>

		<p>Islam is a dangerous, medieval, alien threat to European civilization&hellip;if you give it an inch, it&rsquo;ll take a yard, or meter in this case. The foreign Islamic hordes were stopped at the gates of Vienna and that&rsquo;s where they need to draw the line today. Minarets should be outlawed to preserve traditional European culture or the White race will succumb in the name of political correctness&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is just the beginning.Sometime within the next five years Turkey will be granted full membership of the EU and 100,000,000 plus followers of the religion of peace will have the official right of residence anywhere within the union.Germany with its already considerable Turkish minority will probably fall first.<br>

		<p>My readings on Germany had led me to believe that it&rsquo;s even more in the grip of PC ideology than Britain. So, it was great to read this article and see that &#8220;far-right&#8221; dissent is alive and well. The white race is being defended there, not explicitly, but being defended none the less. </p>
