		<p>I was a legal secretary/paralegal in one of my &#8220;past lives,&#8221; and I know very well that no low-IQ person could function adequately as a litigator or any other type of attorney - the work is just too technical and involved to allow someone of lesser intelligence to serve as an attorney ANYWHERE, let alone at the DOJ.  I have known a number of alcoholic attorneys, and since alcoholism IS a form of mental illness, I know from experience that they can and do achieve success as attorneys.  I don&rsquo;t think blindness or deafness would stand in anyone&rsquo;s way from success as a legal professional.  But &#8220;mental retardation&#8221;?  I draw the line at that one.  My attorney had blessed well BETTER be smarter than I am in her/his field of expertise - that&rsquo;s what I pay him/her for, and if they don&rsquo;t meet that criterion, I&rsquo;m going elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Contrary to what Prep Hbomb says (great handle, btw), I have know a number of attorneys who were pretty dumb, ill informed, poor performers, mentally disturbed, doing drugs, or otherwise impared by a dearth of basic wisdom.  Going to law school and passing the bar only means that you can succeed at those tasks.  And once you are in, it takes quite a lot to get you disbared.</p>

		<p>How could a mentally retarded person get through four years of college and then law school?  Did some bureaucrat just copy down a series of words indicative of &#8220;handicapped&#8221; and apply it even to a job as an attorney?!  <br>
I did once work with a technical-school educated woman who told me her (not very bright) daughter wanted to attend a state university.  She told me the girl&rsquo;s counselor had advised that she go into a high school special-ed program in order to get a scholarship available for retarded students!  This college has since upped its admission standards after having a below-50% overall graduation rate for all students.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve known of a nursing student who was dyslexic and had to have her tests administered orally.  Of course, it would make no dif if she read a doc&rsquo;s dosage order backward or got the wrong patient room number!</p>

		<p>&#8220;DOJ is recruiting lawyers with missing limbs and mental disorders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, I have no objection to giving qualified people in public positions a chance to work, if they&rsquo;re disabled; however, the multicults can never do anything realistically or practical.  They always add an element of incredulousness to the situation, like putting a black in charge of NASA even though he has a scientific I.Q. that is in the basement, with an overall ability that is just as bad.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with an amputee arguing a case, but I&rsquo;m ready to draw the line when these silly people want to drop the school bus requirements for blind people.  Don&rsquo;t laugh.  With these airhead multicults it is a very real possibility.</p>
<p>And giving jobs to those with mental disorders?  Well, if we didn&rsquo;t allow that nearly 70% of lawyers who are PC dregs would be barred from practicing.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, #4   &mdash;   thanks for the handle compliment - I agree with you.  I met a number of attorneys who were tunnel-visioned, impaired with drug or alcohol use, arrogant and ignorant, and just plain idiots.  These rarely reached the top in terms of status, prestige, and money in the legal world.  But they&rsquo;re certainly out there.  The thing is, none of &#8216;em is mentally retarded; they all have IQ&rsquo;s of over 110   &mdash;   but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from being first class jerques.  And yes it DOES take a lot to get an attorney disbarred - but that does happen in extreme cases.  It&rsquo;s rare, though.</p>

		<p>Actually, this is welcome news.  Many of the posters on this site may well find themselves the unwelcome target of a DOJ probe at some point.</p>
<p>Better that it be headed up by some slack-jawed, semi-literate dolt than by a sharp and aggressive prosecutor.</p>
<p>I applaud their efforts to recruit the lame, stupid, unqualified, and feckless to their cause.  They&rsquo;ll make model federal employees.</p>

		<p>The DOJ already has too many lawyers on it&rsquo;s staff who are retarded and have mental problems Eric Holder is just one example</p>

		<p>8 John: You&rsquo;re right.  When I was in the service, there were some sharp civilian attorneys who specialized in military law.  They ran rings around the military lawyers, and anyone with an ounce of sense hired them for their court martial.  The answer to every guilty man&rsquo;s prayer is a stupid prosecutor.  </p>
