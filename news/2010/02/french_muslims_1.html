<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France&rsquo;s top council of Muslim representatives on Monday condemned a weekend attack on a mosque north of Paris and called for a national debate on Islamophobia.</p>
<p>Vandals painted &#8220;Islam get out of Europe&#8221; and &#8220;France is for the French&#8221; on the walls and entrance of the mosque in Crepy-en-Valois overnight Saturday to Sunday.</p>
<p>The French Council of the Muslim Faith said the attack was the latest in a growing trend of violence targeting mosques over the past months and voiced concern for national cohesion.</p>
<p>The council, whose members are elected by French Muslims, called on French authorities to take action to end this &#8220;series of shameful and hateful profanities that target houses of prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It urged President Nicolas Sarkozy to back calls for a parliamentary commission to examine what it called the rise of Islamophobia in France.</p>
<p>The proposal was dropped at the last minute from a report released last week on banning the full Islamic veil, disappointing French Muslim leaders who had pushed for such a debate.</p>
<p>In January, a mosque in the southern town of Castres was targeted by vandals who daubed swastikas and &#8220;Sieg Heil&#8221; on its exterior walls.</p>
<p>The president of the local Muslim association, Abdelmalek Bouregba, blamed the government&rsquo;s debate on national identity for the violence, saying it had let loose anti-Islamic sentiment.</p>
<p>The attackers hung pigs&rsquo; feet on the mosque&rsquo;s door handle and pigs&rsquo; ears on the door along with drawings of the French flag, said Bouregba.</p>
<p>France is home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority, estimated at between five and six million people.<br/>

<p>The message to Muslims should be clear if they would read the &#8220;writing on the wall&#8221; - literally!  You&rsquo;re not wanted in France (or anywhere else in Europe) so go back where you belong. Since you have been in our beautiful cities, you have ruined them and made them unsafe.</p>

		<p>Where was The French Council of the Muslim Faith when their &#8220;youth&#8221; were out destroying France?  Would any Islamic state show as much patience with a violent minority Christian population?  Can anyone remind me how every White country, even Iceland with a population under 300k, have almost identical immigration policies?</p>

<p>Islamic states wouldn&rsquo;t allow christians or anyone else to immigrate in the first place. However, any christian minority that did that would either be beaten and seriously imprisoned or shot in the streets. </p>

		<p>Worldwide these multi - culti immigration policies are being persued by the international socialists thru the auspices of the UN.</p>
<p>We in Australia are told repeatedly that we are obliged to accept refugees &amp; asylum seekers / boat people because it&rsquo;s a UN policy which previous [Labour / socialist] governments agreed to.</p>
<p>So everybody has an immigration policy which is run by the UN.<br/>
They dictate who &amp; how many are to infest western countries.  It&rsquo;s part of their policy of redistribution of poverty.</p>
<p>I need to investigate who holds title deeds to so called &#8220;world heritage&#8221; listed tracts of land. I have a suspicion that the UN holds title to large tracts of land all over the world.<br/>
I hope I am wrong.</p>

		<p>When I read, &#8220;a weekend attack on a mosque north of Paris&#8221; I thought the building was totally demolished.</p>
<p>A little further on I read the &#8220;attack&#8221; consisted of graffiti.</p>
<p>When Muslims burn hundreds of cars and endanger the lives of police, it&rsquo;s called a &#8216;youth disturbance&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The obfuscation going on in French reporting is the establishment in denial.</p>

   This term &#8220;threaten national cohesion&#8221; really sticks in my craw.<br/>
      Muslims are NOT part of the nation no matter what trendy quislings say, and the French had cohesion in abundance before the invasion</p>

		<p>A few Frenchmen are upset about Muslim &#8220;something-or-other&#8221; and paint France is for the French.</p>
<p>Muslims become upset about anything and everything and use it as en excuse to COWARDLY murder people in crowded markets via suicide bombings.</p>
<p>The French council of the Muslim faith calls the spay painting &#8220;shameful and hateful&#8221; Yup, you bet councilmen.  Spray painting is right up there with mass murder.</p>
<p>The French people are developing &#8220;Islamophobia?&#8221; (whatever the heck that is) Good! Great! Too little too late probably, but good!  I just pray that people in the US develope it before we have too many &#8220;councils of Muslim faith&#8221; telling us how to behave.</p>

You needn&rsquo;t worry about that, June.  Given their rampant  birth rates, no matter how many immigrants they send us, within a generation they will have made up the difference and will have even more population than ever.   India or Africa could send us 50 million people and it wouldn&rsquo;t make a dent. Within 20 years they would have been replaced by even more babies.<br/>

<p>Imagining that we are alleviating their population pressures is absurd. Or curing their poverty.  It&rsquo;s like trying to empty out the ocean with a bucket.</p>
<p>They have to cure their problems AT HOME, not by dumping them on us.</p>
