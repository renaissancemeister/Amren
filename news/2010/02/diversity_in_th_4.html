			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duncan Hengest, American Renaissance, January 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the first months of 1991, the United States military annihilated the Iraqi army. After several weeks of air raids and only three days of ground combat, American forces had little more to do but pack up and prepare for a victory parade. More than any other branch of the service, the Army had made the hard climb from its Vietnam abyss to the triumphant force of Desert Storm.</p>
<p>In the Vietnam era, the Army suffered from three major flaws: poorly trained non-commissioned officers, drugs, and racial tension. The victory in the Gulf suggested to the American public that these flaws were fixed and, indeed, two were. The post-Vietnam army started an intense training program for sergeants, and the schooling gets tougher as they move up the ladder. The military also invested heavily in drug screening, and entire units, including senior officers, were put through random drug tests. Specialists were hired to deal with addiction. The last problem, racial tension, however, has been only partly solved.</p>
<p>As 1960s-style integration is increasingly shown to be a myth, the military remains the last bastion of racial mixing, but a thin veneer masks serious trouble. Politicians and pundits brave the wrath of the thought police to keep women out of combat and young troopers away from practicing homosexuals, but no one talks about the problems of race. Despite Hollywood cliches like <cite>Glory,</cite> blacks have often been at best a mixed benefit and at worst a burden to the service. Racial conflict is out of the limelight, and the US Army is an effective fighting force, but trouble can erupt any time.</p>
<p>Non-whites in the armed forces cause three problems. The first is unit and soldier indiscipline. In the past, entire black regiments have behaved badly, and individual blacks often follow the same pattern. Second, blacks and whites sometimes think and behave differently. Bridging the gap is costly and never entirely successful, and racial divisions sap unit morale. Third, there is the added trouble of other non-white troops. An increasing number of racial and religious minorities can give rise to unique kinds of trouble.</p>
<p>The military was officially desegregated by President Truman in 1948, but segregated regiments weren&rsquo;t broken up in earnest until the first year of the Korean War. The catalyst for this was the poor combat record of black units. Most of the men with World War II experience had left, and the army conscripts were often from the bottom of society. Discipline was poor. Task Force Smith, the first ground combat units to face the North Koreans, was wiped out as an effective fighting force. The white regiments were bad but the black ones were worse. One cannot read about the Korean War without running into tales of black units that were unable to hold together under fire.</p>
<p>The all-black 24th Infantry was notorious for hasty retreats. This unit performed so badly that according to Max Hastings in <cite>The Korean War,</cite> General Walton&nbsp;H. Walker, commander of ground forces in Korea, &#8220;recognized that it was possible to use the 24th only as an outpost force, a trip wire in the face of Communist assaults. It proved necessary to maintain another regiment in reserve behind the front, to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke.&#8221; (p. 81.) Another all-black unit, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, performed disgracefully at the battle of Bloody Ridge in August 1951. In fact, &#8220;the 3/9 had done nothing. It had failed miserably in the only real attack it had attempted, and its C.O. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had been on the bottle.&#8221; (T.R. Fehrenbach, <cite>This Kind of War, </cite> p. 359.)</p>
<p>After the disaster of Bloody Ridge, the Army desegregated its units so that blacks would make up roughly 10 percent of each company, and black soldiers were spread out one or two per squad. This meant no single regiment could be expected to do poorly in combat, but &#8220;the social problems, of course, were not solved.&#8221; (T. R. Fehrenbach, <cite>This Kind of War, </cite> p. 359.)</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was the low point for military race relations, and by 1971 there was conflict wherever soldiers were stationed. Robert Heinl, Jr. described the crisis in an article called &#8220;Collapse of the Armed Forces&#8221; in the June 7, 1971 issue of <cite>Armed Forces Journal: </cite><blockquote>&#8220;Racial conflicts (most but not all sparked by young black enlisted men) are erupting murderously in all services. At a recent high commanders&rsquo; conference, General Westmoreland and other senior generals heard the report from Germany that in many units white soldiers are now afraid to enter barracks alone at night for fear of &#8216;head-hunting&rsquo; ambushes by blacks. In the quoted words of one soldier on duty in West Germany, &#8216;I&rsquo;m much more afraid of getting mugged on the post than I am of getting attacked by the Russians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other reports tell of jail-delivery attacks on Army stockades and military police to release black prisoners, and of officers being struck in public by black soldiers. Augsburg, Krailsheim, and Hohenfels are said to be rife with racial trouble. Hohenfels was the scene of a racial fragging last year  &mdash;  one of the few so far recorded outside Vietnam. In Ulm, last fall, a white noncommissioned officer killed a black soldier who was holding a loaded .45 on two unarmed white officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elsewhere, according to <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine, junior officers are now being attacked at night when inspecting barracks containing numbers of black soldiers. Kelley Hill, a Ft. Benning, Ga., barracks area, has been the scene of repeated nighttime assaults on white soldiers. One such soldier bitterly remarked, &#8216;Kelley Hill may belong to the commander in the daytime but it belongs to the blacks after dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the cloistered quarters of WACs have been hit by racial hair-pulling. In one West Coast WAC detachment this year, black women on duty as charge-o-quarters took advantage of their trust to vandalize unlocked rooms occupied by white WACS. On this rampage, they destroyed clothing, emptied drawers, and overturned furniture of their white sisters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As early as July 1969 the Marines (who had previously enjoyed a highly praised record on race) made headlines at Camp Lejeune, N.C., when a mass affray launched by 30-50 black Marines ended fatally with a white corporal&rsquo;s skull smashed in and 145 other white Marines in the sick bay. That same year, at Newport, R.I., naval station, blacks killed a white petty officer, while in March 1971 the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., outside Washington, was beset by racial fighting so severe that the base enlisted men&rsquo;s club had to be closed.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Today, tensions are not nearly so bad. An all-volunteer army with standards that weed out the worst offenders is no longer the battleground it once was, but by the late 1990s black and Hispanic gangs were a serious problem. In Killeen, Texas, (outside Fort Hood) military gang members were a danger to civilians. The Army made a thorough effort to stamp out gangs, but the Department of Justice&rsquo;s National Gang Intelligence Center released a 2007 report covering nearly all the notorious non-white street gangs:<blockquote>&#8220;[They] have been documented on military installations both domestically and internationally. These members are present in most branches and across all ranks of the military, but are most common among the junior enlisted ranks. The US Army, Army Reserves, and National Guard are likely to have the most enlisted gang members because they are either the largest branches of the military, the service is part-time, or they tend not to be as selective as the other branches of the armed services.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>The report noted that white extremists in the military did kill a black couple in 1996, but after an extensive investigation, the authorities concluded that &#8220;there was no widespread or organized extremist activity in the Army,&#8221; and that &#8220;gang-related activities appear to be more pervasive than extremist activity on and near Army installations and are becoming a significant security concern for many soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably the greatest problem with blacks in the Army today is lack of ability, despite armed services qualification tests that wash out a considerably greater proportion of black applicants than white. Before my combat tour I found that blacks only slowly grasped the complex skills necessary for modern warfare. Once, as a passenger on a military bus, I overheard a group of blacks talking about something they all had in common: re-training. If a recruit fails a task, such as assembling a machine gun or operating a radio, he is culled from his squad for re-training. I never heard a knot of white soldiers discussing their common experience of re-training.</p>
<p>Blacks also fail the Army&rsquo;s quite challenging field artillery training course at an appalling rate. Statistics aren&rsquo;t public, but when I was learning the dark voodoo of artillery gunnery at Fort Sill&rsquo;s Officer Basic Course I was surprised that <em>all</em> of the blacks in my platoon who started with me flunked out or &#8220;recycled.&#8221; Likewise, all who graduated with me were &#8220;recycles&#8221; from earlier courses. These men were not raw 18-year-olds; to get in you had to be a college graduate and get through pre-commissioning training.</p>
<p>This lack of ability makes for problems. One black lieutenant who worked for me in the US needed special training to keep a monthly budget. Although he was a college graduate, he could not figure out how to pay his bills. He made enough money, but he couldn&rsquo;t manage his finances. Soon, creditors were calling the unit, and the situation was an embarrassment for the chain of command.</p>
<p>When I was stationed in Korea, a black major I worked for lead his troops from his barracks room. He would give a few directions by cell phone, and spend the rest of his time watching movies. This lack of face-to-face leadership led to disaster. In the office his outfit used, the ceiling tiles were rotting or missing, with exposed wires hanging down; the desks were covered with dust and garbage. This shabby ethos spread out to the men. The captains were demoralized, new lieutenants untrained. The sergeants worked uphill to maintain standards. Because there was no plan for combat training, the troops were available to be sucked into meaningless work details, such as grass trimming at the base post office.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Iraq, my night-shift counterpart was a black man with more than 20 years of experience. He had been diagnosed with serious sleep apnea and needed a special breathing machine to help him sleep. A man with this condition should not be in a war zone, but large black men are physically imposing, and often get their way. At his pre-deployment medical screening, he was naturally marked as not-deployable. He took exception to this and nearly came to blows with the doctor. The doctor cleared him.</p>
<p>During the night shift, he collected routine reports and did typical staff work. In the morning I based my work on what he had done, but I wasn&rsquo;t getting the information or cooperation I needed. I began getting criticism for my section&rsquo;s work, and soon every shift-change briefing became a heated argument.</p>
<p>One day this man took offense when I pointed out that every time an artillery shell is fired, it uses up a corresponding powder charge, and that we needed to order both replacement items together. His reply to this centuries-old observation was to insult me and remind me that I wasn&rsquo;t as &#8220;experienced&#8221; as he. Matters just got worse. Finally I cornered him on an easy thing he missed, and furiously asked him if he <em>actually</em> understood what he was doing. Unable to look me in the eye, he stormed out of the tent.</p>
<p>He got a medical evacuation from Iraq that very day because his breathing machine for sleep apnea suddenly &#8220;broke.&#8221; An enlisted man later told me he had innocently lent the officer a screwdriver that day. In any case, my section was never accused of sloppy work again.</p>
<p>That experience with the black officer was my racial awakening. He was the first of a host of blacks I saw in Iraq who suddenly discovered they had angina, breathing problems, or other hard-to-see &#8220;ailments.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not a doctor, so I don&rsquo;t know if their complaints were valid, but I always had a gut feeling they were a trick to go home early. Once they are in a war, few people want to stick around, and even fewer want to come back, but in general, the whites I knew left the service only after they had honorably finished their combat tours.</p>
<p>In Iraq, I was repeatedly stunned by the inability of many senior black officers to think through problems. In one case, I asked for increased close air support for an area commonly used by insurgents to fire mortars at American bases. A black officer refused air support, suggesting that we &#8220;put snipers in trees&#8221; to deal with the mortars. Iraq is a barren desert. The trees are mostly irrigated date palms and cannot support a sniper. That black officer worked hard and was certainly brave, but I am still amazed he came up with that foolishness about snipers. Bad staff work is a tremendous opportunity cost. It took me hours to get fighter-bomber coverage. This was valuable time wasted, and lives were needlessly endangered.</p>
<p>Likewise in Iraq, I had to cool tensions between a white Air National Guard lieutenant colonel and a black warrant officer. The white colonel was a Vietnam vet who had bitter memories of black behavior when he as a young draftee. The warrant officer was essentially worthless. I finally solved the problem simply by keeping the two men apart. I gave the black man no work, and he spent his waking hours playing video games.</p>
<p>Once I saw a black major so befuddled by the unit&rsquo;s vehicle bumper number standard that a five minute maintenance meeting turned into an afternoon marathon. What was the problem? Every combat vehicle in a unit gets a number. It is painted on the front and rear bumpers, and conforms to a standard that places the vehicle in its exact squad. For example, 1-300 IN K-6 would be the Kilo Company, First Battalion, 300th Infantry Commander&rsquo;s Vehicle. Different units have slightly different numbering standards, but they are not hard to figure out  &mdash;  except for this black major, who was stumped.</p>
<p>He was the operations officer, and his failure to grasp the obvious spread out to more important areas. Soon, battalion-level staff functions slowed to a crawl or just stopped. Routine procedures such as coordinating with Range Control when firing artillery became difficult operations. Eventually nothing worked right. When the head of a 500-man outfit does not have the brains to make common tasks routine or enough respect to make orders stick, things go wrong. The men become grouchy and troublesome. During several training exercises, 155mm artillery shells hit dangerously close to forward observers. Junior officers nicknamed the major &#8220;Abortion.&#8221; He was quietly replaced, but in a way that let him keep moving up.</p>
<p>Not all blacks and other non-whites were disruptive. Many were fantastic soldiers. But I did discover that nearly every major problem, accident, or scandal I saw in the service had a black or Hispanic at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Black officers are often unsatisfactory but at least they do not usually commit the kinds of crimes common among young black enlisted men. As a peacetime platoon leader, I was always being roped into rape investigations. Invariably the suspects were black. Whites would get drunk and rowdy, but I never knew one to be a rapist. Thanks to these investigations, I learned a new expression: &#8220;running a train.&#8221; This means gang rape, and comes from men standing in line waiting their turn. It is strictly black slang.</p>
<p>One black soldier in my platoon was a good soldier and a hard worker, but he had heavy baggage. He was picked up by the military police for drunk driving, and once he had to have all his combat gear reissued. He said it was stolen, but I suspect he pawned it. Still, he did his job well, and I worked hard to help him when he was indicted for rape in a civilian court. We even sent him home from a deployment a week ahead of his comrades so he could attend court hearings.</p>
<p>On the day of his trial, his platoon sergeant and section chief arrived in court, resplendent in their uniforms, to show support for their man. The judge informed the chain of command that the suspect had not met any of his preliminary court dates, and that he was going to be locked up. We never learned where he had gone when we sent him home, but he didn&rsquo;t go to court. His commander had to start writing up the paperwork to kick him out of the Army.</p>
<p>Sometimes black officers and leaders do fall into the error of their younger brothers. The Army covered up a serious gang rape scandal when a group of black officers in the 10th Mountain Division videotaped themselves ravishing some female soldiers. The officers were alumni of a black fraternity, and they brought their victims along as part of the entertainment for the fraternity&rsquo;s reunion party. This was on the heels of the Navy&rsquo;s Tail Hook scandal in 1991, so the bad press and the racial angle made for a quick high-brass silencing. The black officers were relieved of duty, but the cover up was so effective that I cannot find any trace of this incident on the Internet. I learned the facts from two different veterans of the unit who did not know each other, and who were an ocean apart when they told me their tales.</p>
<p>The 1997 sex/rape scandal at Aberdeen Proving Grounds was widely reported, however, and involved black drill sergeants shaking down female recruits for sex. The same year, the Sergeant Major of the Army, the highest-ranking enlisted man, was court marshaled when six women accused him of pressuring them for sex. Gene McKinney, the first black to serve in that position, was acquitted of sexual harassment but convicted of obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>The military has the same racial crime-rate discrepancies as civilian life. However, the Army has a job to do, and dealing with crime chews up resources. An enormous amount of effort went into the McKinney trial. Is there an important innovation that was not thought up as a result?</p>
<p>In a free society one would expect &#8220;whistleblowers,&#8221; but they are rare because of the equal opportunity bureaucracy. The consequences of failing an EO rating are worse than failing the annual marksmanship test. Every evaluation for leaders has a section on support for equal opportunity. A &#8220;No&#8221; ends a career.</p>
<p>Blacks know this, and some are tempted to make false charges of &#8220;racism.&#8221; One quartermaster captain told me he narrowly avoided a serious drubbing after a black first sergeant accused him of calling her and her troops &#8220;monkeys.&#8221; Her outfit ran a warehouse in Iraq, which he was responsible for inspecting. He said the warehouse was a &#8220;disaster,&#8221; and he thinks the &#8220;monkeys&#8221; accusation was meant to be a cover up. The accusation didn&rsquo;t go very far, but only because there was a black soldier with the captain who saw it all, and testified that the accusation was false. After that, the captain dealt with the warehouse supervisors through a black subordinate. As he explained to me, he &#8220;didn&rsquo;t need any more headaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Race causes other wastes. Colin Powell writes in his memoirs about a division commander who ordered every dogface to watch the movie <cite>Brian&rsquo;s Song.</cite> It is about an intense friendship between two football players  &mdash;  one white, the other black  &mdash;  and the commander thought the movie would ease racial tension. The division even sent MPs to round up idle men and bring them to theaters. What counter-insurgency book wasn&rsquo;t written because of <cite>Brian&rsquo;s Song</cite> duty?</p>
<p>There is a different problem with our increasingly &#8220;diverse&#8221; army. Many non-whites simply don&rsquo;t put forth much effort, and in extreme cases they can be more hostile to whites than to the enemy. A Korean West Point graduate pulled strings to leave his Iraq-bound unit for garrison duty near Seoul, where he became a multicultural &#8220;director of community outreach.&#8221; We were in a war, but he used up taxpayer dollars to take an unnecessary diversity job in Korea.</p>
<p>There are far worse problems than sloughing off. A serious fragging nearly decapitated a brigade of the 101st Airborne at the start of the Iraq War. An American-born black convert to Islam, Hasan Karim Akbar, killed two officers and wounded the brigade commander. In another fragging incident, Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, posted to Tikrit, Iraq, allegedly rolled a hand grenade into a room and killed two officers. His trial is hung up in legal motions.</p>
<p>Non-whites have caused other trouble. There have been serious fears of spying among the Muslim troops at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. All charges were later dropped against West Point graduate and Muslim chaplain, Captain James Yee, but he raised enough suspicion to be arrested. Several Arabs were arrested along with Captain Yee. They weren&rsquo;t convicted of spying but received convictions for lesser, but serious infractions.</p>
<p>Espionage cases are hard to prove. Accomplices can vanish back to their native lands, witnesses can be assassinated, and fingerprints, DNA, and other physical evidence can be more easily explained. Sometimes counterintelligence discovers evidence inadmissible in court. Often spies can be convicted only if they are caught in a sting where the evidence is overwhelming and can be used in court.</p>
<p>America now fights its wars in the Third World, and our policy of putting Third World people in the military is dangerous. It is only a matter of time before a Somali, Kurdish, Laotian, or Hmong &#8220;refugee&#8221; has the authority to call in air-strikes or command riflemen. Like the Romans who were destroyed by their Germanic mercenaries, Americans could find that their army is a foreign viper.</p>
<p>Diversity has been turned against us in the past. During the Philippine Insurrection early in the 20th century, the troublesome, all-black 24th Infantry produced a renegade named David Fagen. He deserted from the American side and accepted a Philippine Army commission as a captain. The Filipino insurgents had offered such a deal to any black deserter. Captain Fagen was not the only black turncoat, but their numbers were small, since Filipinos and blacks are a world apart. If the fighting had been in Africa things might have been different. Still, the Fagen incident caused a decline in trust between the races, and even a certain hysteria. After American setbacks, one journalist concluded that Filipino successes were the result of, &#8220;the scheming of American deserters, who were so familiar with army routines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Successful military operations must be glued together with trust, and diversity destroys trust. In diverse groups, the tendency is to hunker down, avoid making friends, and just try to survive. Instead of quickly starting from a common point, American soldiers must spend time developing trust. Some black senior officers cannot quite believe that white subordinates aren&rsquo;t ready to blast them; the ghosts of Reconstruction and Jim Crow rise easily at a forward operating base filled with muscular, blue-eyed white men with assault rifles.</p>
<p>Likewise, white soldiers may not trust black officers, since they are often baffled by simple problems and quick to be swept up in vice. Too often, black leaders and enlisted men can appear to be nothing more than the gangster types who were despised back in a white&rsquo;s home town.</p>
<p>Instead of working through problems, developing innovative tactics, or focusing on training, soldiers must spend time smoothing wrinkles and dealing with tensions that otherwise would not exist. The alienation, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug-taking, and other pathologies commonly found in veterans since Vietnam are probably related, at least in part, to this lack of trust.</p>
<p>The unwillingness to recognize desegregation&rsquo;s failures may even influence strategy at the highest level. In its August 8, 2003 issue, the British newspaper, the <cite>Telegraph,</cite> quoted from a speech by Condoleezza Rice:<blockquote>&#8220;&#8216;Like many of you, I grew up around the home-grown terrorism of the 1960s. I remember the bombing of the church in Birmingham in 1963, because one of the little girls that died was a friend of mine,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p> &#8220;Black Americans should stand by others seeking freedom today, she went on, and shun the &#8216;condescending&rsquo; argument that some races or nations were not interested in or ready for Western freedoms.</p>
<p> &#8220;&#8216;We&rsquo;ve heard that argument before. And we, more than any, as a people, should be ready to reject it,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;That view was wrong in 1963 in Birmingham and it is wrong in 2003 in Baghdad and in the rest of the Middle East.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>In fact, Iraq has no history of democracy nor any real prospects for it, and more than 50 years after Birmingham, American jails are filled with blacks. Delusions always come back to haunt the deluded.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s position at the top is lonely and precarious. Any military slipup can embolden our enemies. Pol Pot was certainly aided by America&rsquo;s withdrawal from Vietnam, and Osama bin Laden was inspired to strike after our failure in Somalia. Any lack of trust within our fighting formations, any lost opportunity, any crime, any bad judgment makes the worst more likely.</p>
<p>But the most important danger is domestic. It is simply a matter of time before whites vote clearly for their own interests. At that point, an alien army could spark a serious domestic and Constitutional crisis. To avoid such a calamity, Uncle Sam needs an army loyal to Americans and sympathetic to their institutions.</p>

		<p>I could add my own encyclopedia of stories after 14 yrs in the Army. But I will relate 2 events that happened during Desert Storm which, to the best of my knowledge, did not make media attention back home.</p>
<p>1. There was a movement in black thinking that was spreading quickly in the ranks. Some half-intelligent minorty figured out blacks made up a higher percentage of the fighting force compared to the general population back home (most are support roles BTW). So they rebelled and threatened not to fight due to the odds of dying at a higher rate then their white counterparts. This made it up the Chain-of-Command until Colin Powell had to adress this issue. He issued a statement to the blacks that no one drafted them, or twisted their arms to join. Basically, shut up and carry out their jobs. This then quietly faded away. (From this, I held Powell in the highest esteem until he defaulted to his ancestry mode and endorsed BHO.)</p>
<p>2. After a little length of time elapsed, and blacks weren&rsquo;t giving up easily, another myth began fermenting. They once again came up with a whopper which was gaining steam amongst their ranks. What they were spreading was that blacks came from Africa, the muslim religion&rsquo;s founding came from Africa, ergo, the true brotherhood is a black muslim. So, since they represent their founders, they cannot fight and kill a fellow muslim. Once again the blacks began announcing a threat to lay their arms down and not fight. (I can&rsquo;t recall how this ended, but I believe it didn&rsquo;t get solid footing before the actual war commenced.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly 20 yrs since this war and I have relayed it to many folks. Not a single one have I come across heard nor believed this happened. I know, I was there.</p>

		<p>Seems like the incompetence of blacks is in every walk of life.</p>
<p>In my own case, in Vietnam, out lieutenant (all Marine officers were White)asked me to train a black guy for Forward Observer duty. I said fine and he went out on patrol with me and I showed him how to read a map, use a compass, and call in a fire missions, etc. But, over time, I noticed he wasn&rsquo;t picking it up no matter what I tried. After a couple of weeks, the lieutenant asked me how it was going and I had to admit that I wasn&rsquo;t much of a teacher. That I wasn&rsquo;t getting it across to the guy. The lieutenant took the guy and put him with another FO, who I saw awhile later and he told me he had the same trouble I had. So, I guess it wasn&rsquo;t me. Of course, he was never given a company of his own to call in 81&rsquo;s, arty, or air for, thank God.</p>
<p>In my later life, I saw the same type of things continually with blacks not being able to grasp easy concepts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add this, a bit off topic. Things in this country have become so technologically advanced anymore, it seems as each day goes by, blacks fall further and further out of this society. If you look at old slave advertisements, they all contained one common denominator besides the idea that the slaves were black people. That was, their occupations. If such a poster was to be made today, there couldn&rsquo;t be any occupation listed for black people in the ad (for the most part). Basically, I believe that&rsquo;s at the bottom of all the violence with blacks today. Blacks just are irrelevant to this society, not withstanding the illusion of their abilities that is being maintained by govt. edict. They get up each day and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they get up or not. They can&rsquo;t add anything to the society. They&rsquo;re just physically here, nothing more.</p>

		<p>I remember when it was dangerous for White women sailors and dependents to walk around Treasure Island,a big Navy base in San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Also the astonishing amount of black teens arrested for shoplifting in San Francisco who were military dependents from the Presidio army base.  What was really surprising was that most of them were the children of majors and colonels rather than lifer sergeants.</p>
<p>I remember when I brought home from the Post Office one of those forms 18 year olds have to fill out in case there is ever another conscription. I gave it to my son. He was always a quiet young man.  But he started yelling.  He calmed down when I explained he would not immediately be dragged off to Camp Pendleton to be housed with black gangsters.  That&rsquo;s the impression the military makes on many people,sort of like government jobs.  A welfare system for shiftless black and hispanic thugs.</p>

		<p>I am a 2 year Vietnam war vetern and this story has brought back to my mind many of the things white soldiers had to endure because of black &#8216;soldiers&rsquo;. There was always tension and a great deal of animosity between whites and blacks. Blacks never wanted to carry their load which always ended up on the shoulders of white soldiers. There was fighting, insults and unbelievable laziness along with the black attitude which I thought was not only incredible but suicidal in a war zone. Black soldiers endangered not only themselves but everyone else that was joined with them. I wanted nothing to do with them. The Governmental idiots in D.C. listened to the black complaint that too many blacks were dying in Vietnam, so the traitorous white idiots started removing blacks from combat units and putting white soldiers in their places to die, something which I will never forget or forgive. Remember also,when the American embassy was taken by the so called iranian &#8216;students&rsquo; white soldiers were separated from the female and black soldiers. The females and blacks were then told they could leave for the U.S. but the white soldiers would remain behind as prisoners. All the blacks and females deserted the white soldiers and left them to their fates. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it!!! Deserting your fellow soldiers was unheard of and it is something I would never have done. The blacks and females were welcomed home with flowers and great spectacles here in the U.S. and the white soldiers were left to rot in Iran. Again, this is something I will never forget or forgive. The white man can only depend on soldiers who are white like him. It&rsquo;s all about the tribe and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t understand that does so at his own peril.</p>

		<p>&#8221; muslim religion&rsquo;s founding came from Africa, &#8220;</p>
<p>Shows how totally ignorant blacks are.  The Muslim religion was founded in Southern Arabia, in what is now the country of Saudi Arabia.  Arabs are White caucasians.  Arabia and Saudi Arabia are not in Africa. The Arabian Penninsula where Saudi is located is a subcontinent, offshoot, of Western Asia populated by indigenious caucasian people.</p>
<p>There is a lot of black African mixed into the people of the Arab and other Muslim countries because of the long standing Arab/ Muslim slave trade.  There are also descendants of northern Europeans,Chinese and other Asian slaves of the Arabs.</p>
<p>But race mixing and the slave trade aside, Islam was founded in Saudi Arabia located in Western Asia.</p>

Most likely, if you had to deal with a black&hellip;&hellip;.  it was a problem.  If there were more than one, the trouble was more out in the open.<br>
Later I spent many yrs in the US Army  &mdash;    same deal only worse as blacks learned long ago how to game the system and their small intelligence seems to focus on the gaming and new ways and attitudes to push the envelope in their hatred of things white.  It&rsquo;s as if they realize they can&rsquo;t compete in many things whites take for granted&hellip;..  budgets, planning, percentages etc etc.  so they are determined to go against it.</p>

		<p>As a retired military man (28 years), I could not agree with you more. If you are a white, Christian, heterosexual male, the American armed forces is the LAST place you will want to be   &mdash;   unless you enjoy being the whipping boy for every black, gay-friendly, Christian-bashing C.O. promoted in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; to a position for which he is completely unqualified. Just wait until that tinsel-laden cream puff, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike &#8220;son-of-a-Hollywood-press-agent&#8221; Mullen (a man almost universally despised by rank-and-file soldiers) and his equally-hated cohort, Defense Secretary Gates, ram platoons of openly gay soldiers down our throats (after the elections, of course!); then straight white soldiers will REALLY be caught between Scylla and Charybdis   &mdash;   taking orders from gays, muslims and blacks and being vilified for their efforts, too. I predict an exodus of white military personnel at the rank-and-file level that will make the heads of military &#8220;leadership&#8221; spin. Of course, after the exodus, we&rsquo;ll have a military that is far more &#8220;diverse&#8221;, more &#8220;in touch with its feelings&#8221;, less &#8220;judgmental&#8221;, and &#8220;more sensitive to the rights of others.&#8221; We&rsquo;ll just have our butts kicked on every battlefield in the world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;One black lieutenant who worked for me in the US needed special training to keep a monthly budget. Although he was a college graduate, he could not figure out how to pay his bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>What should be mentioned here is that this black lieutenant is a typical black college graduate.  Most all of them are advanced through the school system by AA entry, grading and certification.  </p>
<p>The blacks who can earn a degree on their own, are on a par with the average to below-average white college student and are regarded as geniuses, because in comparison to other blacks they come across to most whites as brilliant.  Does Obama ring a bell in that regard?</p>
<p>The US military&hellip;..if it is still in its present form a few years from now&hellip;.will suffer a disaster due to black and other non-white incompetence on a grand scale.</p>
<p>I mention &#8220;in its present form,&#8221; because every indication is the country is not going to afford to prop up multicult programs for much longer due to our deteriorating economic condition.  For the first time ever I&rsquo;m hearing from many pundits on the news shows that the US could go bankrupt.  </p>
<p>Welcome to the real world my friends.  Many in the private sector have been expecting just such an occurrence for about three years now. </p>

		<p>When I was at Camp Pendleton (late 1960&rsquo;s) whites were advised to travel in groups to avoid being accosted by black &#8220;marines&#8221;.  The attitude of blacks even in Viet Nam was racial (except when we were in a firefight).  My Vietnamese friends quite often asked how was it that blacks and whites could get along.

		<p>The above article is chilling albeit no great surprise and the analogy to the fall of the Roman Army due to the introduction of Barbarian troops who had no loyalty proves that we still fail to learn from History and therefore are doomed to repeat it. Should there every be political turmoil in this country, we would be faced with a predominantly Black military whose members would be more than happy to shoot Whites. Hell, we&rsquo;re giving the Bruthas  advanced tactical training that will later be used against us. </p>
<p>Remember the two California police officers who were ambushed by the Hispanic Marine?  They found a photo of him and his &#8220;carnales&#8221; at his home.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I see it every day. In the last several years we have gone through at least 5 Black Asst. Principals. The only good one left because he had too long a commute. The other four were not rehired because of their inability/ unwillingness to do their jobs.</p>

		<p>The US&rsquo;s increasing heavy dependence on private contractors to carry out what amounts to combat roles may be linked to race as well. An Xe (formerly Blackwater) or an Aegis can hire pretty much whom it wants, without political pressure to fill this or that quota.  This leaves the armed forces free to promote based on race rather than on merit, while the private company can ensure higher-quality fighters.</p>

		<p>Wow&hellip;I&rsquo;m so glad that I&rsquo;ve never had to personally deal with black troops.  Friends that attended the same ROTC with me bemoan them at seemingly every turn.  It&rsquo;s that 10% that take up 90% of your time, so they tell me.  DUIs, rapes, theft, bribes from contractors, etc.  I could not handle it.  Thank God I spent my entire career in Army aviation where you need half a brain and can&rsquo;t have a fear of heights.  The last GSAB I commanded (General Support Aviation Battalion) in Afghanistan, it was 100% white.  No blacks, no Asians, no Hispanics.  Everyone got along and the missions were completed without any complications on the ground at all.  Never had to deal with the kids getting boozed up with the locals unlike other units with the mix, no thefts, no loss of sensitive gear, no crimes&hellip;period.  I would not have lasted this long if somehow I was in transportation, or any supply type unit.  Infantry?  No thanks as any rock with lips gets in with prior felonies, drug use waivers, etc.  </p>

		<p>12 Anon: Blacks are generally too inept to gain much from advanced training.  Good infantry are skilled and are capable of taking initiative, which is why the U.S. infantry is mostly White.  The artillery, for example, has lots of Blacks, because gun crews work at specific tasks under direct supervision.  <br>
     Our elite infantry, Special, Forces, Navy SEALS and the like, are even Whiter than the regular infantry.  I would be more worried about multi-culti generals, who would restrain their White troops, than the soldiers themselves.  </p>

		<p>tryclosan has it right. </p>
<p>I know people associated with private military contractors and can confirm their organizations are nearly exclusively white as you can get. Military contractors don&rsquo;t waste their time hiring unqualified, or even marginally qualified applicants. That immediately rules out almost all non- whites, especially blacks.  </p>
<p>Getting new contracts, profits and avoiding public/government scrutiny are the top priorities. If contractors had the same lax recruiting requirements as the US army, they&rsquo;d lose their contracts and profits. They&rsquo;d also be bogged down in constant litigation and casualties would probably reach unacceptable levels. And lastly, racial baggage would result in diminished unit cohesion which doesn&rsquo;t bode well in combat zones. Their scrutiny is entirely understandable.<br>

		<p>For most of my six years in the army, I considered blacks a greater immediate threat than any potential adversary. The more important a job or team of workers was, the less likely you were to see blacks there. In the army, as in American society at large, they were basically irrelevant aside from the problems they caused.</p>
<p>As a poor white boy of modest means, I finished my college degree in three years taking evening classes and CLEP tests with the army paying 75% of tuition. Also learned German well enough to earn language qualification during my tour there; the language classes counted toward my degree.</p>
<p>There were dumb whites in the army, mind you, but almost every black was dumb as well as hateful toward nearly everything and everybody. Blacks  &mdash;  and only blacks  &mdash;  resented my self improvement activities. I can recall two different black females, who worked in our office at two different times, spending a great deal of their time and mental energy insulting me about my industriousness. Yet any person, if sufficiently motivated and nominally intelligent, could have done what I did.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s 100% accurate, as I see it also.</p>
<p>My experience was that the quality of black NCO&rsquo;s seemed to be o.k. for line companies, (A few years before Desert Storm), because there isn&rsquo;t much to learn and usually nothing complicated to figure out, but they didn&rsquo;t qualify in the special operations branches, like the Green Berets and the SEALS for the most part, although a scant few did qualify for the Rangers and the Green Berets.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a black in the SEALS, but there may have been.   </p>
<p>The black officer quality, although much higher than the black enlisted man, rarely was qualified for his position, however.  If it wasn&rsquo;t one thing, it was another and with VERY few exceptions all of them just weren&rsquo;t up to par&hellip;at least in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>The high tech support MOS positions (military occupational specialty)were filled by the brass with as many blacks as they could cram into them in spite of the fact it took repeated training to get them on a level considered passible for the job they were doing. I imagine this was done so the politically correct brass could refute charges by Congressional blacks that blacks are mostly cannon fodder for the military.  </p>
<p>Using the military to pursue a policy of social engineering in a world where the US is rapidly becoming weaker, while other nations are becoming stronger, is going to result in a military catastrophe someday.  I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>

<p>I can very well identify with you on that. On one job I had, years ago, which involved a lot of typing,  I would use my spare time in between work that came in to practice my typing in order to improve it. I wanted to become <i>expert at EVERYTHING I did.  </i>The blacks there (I was the only white) plainly resented this and made it no secret. They would sit around talking and watching TV in between work, while I did typing exercises.  They made disparaging comments and dirty looks at me getting my speed up on the typewriter.  They didn&rsquo;t like that. They could have done so too, but they only did just as much as they HAD to do, and nothing more. Their attitude was:  &#8220;Look at that big fool!&#8221;  Well, lay offs came around and most of them were let go, while I got promoted and became a supervisor.  So who were the big fools in the long run?  As often is said here, blacks just don&rsquo;t look ahead. They take life day by day.</p>

		<p>I am a reservist in a Marine Corps infantry unit and recently returned from Al Anbar. </p>
<p>I respect all of the opinions posted here by &#8220;older&#8221; veterans, but hopefully I can put many of you at ease, at least from a front-line infantry standpoint. </p>
<p>The Marine Corps infantry is, quite literally, all-volunteer, as you must choose an 03 MOS at enlistment. Blacks have an uncanny, instinctive ability to detect and avoid any activity that will require hard, back-breaking work and/or involve life-threatening danger; thus, blacks flock to the support and admin specialties.  This avoidance ability also applies to direct infantry support positions such as forward observers, mortar crews, assaultmen, etc. </p>
<p>As a result, the men (and sometimes women) who are actually locating, closing with, and engaging the enemy are there by choice. The Marines actually pulling the triggers are competent and are generally trustworthy. </p>
<p>Blacks are indeed a mess, both in the field and in garrison. They fight. They steal. They fail to stay in shape. They hang out at the internet cafe. They lose sensitive equipment. However, experienced NCOs and Staff NCOs expect this and plan for it. </p>
<p>We smile in their faces, pat them on the back, try to be friendly, then send them on a useless errand so that the professionals can get down to doing the nation&rsquo;s business. </p>
<p>Is it unfair? I don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s all about managing your expectations. </p>

		<p>I had the misfortune of working a consulting contract for a client near a major Army base just a few years ago, and in order to save money I rented an apartment in a building that also housed a lot of army types and welfare recipients. Most of the welfare types were white, and a good number of the army people were black. Frankly, the welfare types were easier to get along with, since I don&rsquo;t put up with very much nonsense.<br>
The army types, including a lot of NCOs and a few low grade officers(in more than one sense of the word) were drug users, drunks, prostitutes, etc. I left for my client early most mornings, and had to thread my way past the passed out drunken soldiers lying on the hallway floors. Every night during the week this was. Most weekends I went home, but on a few weekends because of winter conditions I remained in the area. Friday night thru Sunday night was a non-stop party for these people, except when the offioers came by, to nominally inspect the apartments of their charges. Actually, the officers came by to drink, use drugs, and patronize the hookers. A few times, drunken officers tried to get me to let them inspect my room, even though I wasn&rsquo;t involved with them in any way. One major put his fist thru my door, and found himself facing a shotgun muzzle while I waited for the local cops to visit. The cops got his CO to take him back to the base, both black, and my client asked me not to take the time from work to prosecute.<br>
I would buy Chinese war bonds if I could. The US armed forces have gone down the tubes. </p>

Although you were entirely in the right, being right doesn&rsquo;t always matter.  I would have been extremely worried in your situation, knowing how they cooperate in covering up for one another and how fertile they can be in coming up with counter charges. You&rsquo;re lucky you weren&rsquo;t the one arrested and taken off in cuffs for some specious offense.  When you tangle with the military or the police, you&rsquo;re at a disadvantage   &mdash;   one against many. You&rsquo;re up against a huge organization that looks out for its own. Perhaps that major was just too drunk to think up a plausible countercharge that would make YOU the culprit!</p>

		<p>I served with SF in the RVN &#8216;69-&#8216;70.  The hostility of black EM in support units there was palpable.  Pater Arnett was spectacularly correct in capturing the Army&rsquo;s racial problems during that time in one episode of &#8220;Vietnam   &mdash;   The 10,000 Day War.&#8221; That was the only one I saw.  </p>
<p>In the Special Forces Officer&rsquo;s Course I assigned to a black lieutenant the task of wiring a TNT charge to initiate an ambush in a training exercise.  I gave him the signal to detonate the charge and nothing happened.  Upon investigation I found he&rsquo;d wired the two legs of the circuit together into one long single strand between the battery and the charge, hence no current could flow through the detonator. (Another sharp black officer friend there with me was as amazed and amused as I was.)</p>
<p>Years later I spent two weeks with a brigade of the 82nd during a Reforger exercise in Germany.  A black operations MSG, a very decent sort I must add, made an entry in the log that &#8220;the enemy frost was moving up the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the finest military leaders I encountered was a black fellow OCS.  Some black NCOs in Nam were competent and intelligent, but then that was SF, which had none of the drug and racial problems of the units in the rear or some of the line infantry units (e.g., listening to radio on point).</p>
<p>Mr. Hengest, I fear, provides insights from far wider experience with and research into the problems of non-whites in the military.  Obviously, the pathologies of the underclass black culture and the incompetence of the AA-wunderkindern are firmly entrenched in the military and studiously overlooked by the upper echelons thereof.</p>
<p>Jeremiah Wright woke me up to the undeniable fact that the civil rights revolution has done very little to make this a color blind society.  Far from it.  The seething hatred is overwhelmingly a one-way street.  This article has also opened my eyes to the realities of the volunteer Army.  Multiculturalism and failure to confront black underclass culture, AA, and black racism have done immense damage to all of our institutions.  &#8220;Thinking white&#8221; really is something that a great many blacks avoid like the plague.</p>

		<p><em>The high tech support MOS positions (military occupational specialty)were filled by the brass with as many blacks as they could cram into them in spite of the fact it took repeated training to get them on a level considered passible for the job they were doing. I imagine this was done so the politically correct brass could refute charges by Congressional blacks that blacks are mostly cannon fodder for the military.</em> @whiteraven<br>

<p>Apparently, according to commenter &#8216;Quiet Professional&rsquo; who is a Marine Corps infantryman, Blacks do not even make for good combat soldiers   &mdash;   let anone &#8216;specialists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When I was in the Army, they made for even worse MP&rsquo;s (Military Police officers). </p>

		<p>Back in the mid 1970&rsquo;s I caught a ride on a bus from the airport Rhein-Main in W. Germany to my unit&rsquo;s town. I was one of few white guys on the bus.</p>
<p>The German bus driver had a small refrigerator with beer and sandwiches. In English he announced that he was sorry but could only take Deutsche Marks. All the new arrivals were quite bewildered, it took me a while before I realized that they did not know that there were other currencies aside from the US dollar.<br>
I believe some did not even know where they were.<br>
Thank God most of these black soldiers were kept penned up on the base and did not get out to the German towns too much.</p>
