			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jen√©e Desmond-Harris, Time, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This Valentine&rsquo;s Day, more of us than ever will be looking for love online. And if recent studies are any guide, relatively few women on mainstream dating sites will bother to respond to overtures from men of Asian descent. Likewise, black women will be disproportionately snubbed by men of all races. {snip}</p>
<p>Chemistry.com requires users to identify their ethnicity; like eHarmony, it considers members&rsquo; racial preferences when suggesting matches. Match.com lets users filter their searches by race. The site&rsquo;s profiles include space to indicate interest (or lack thereof) in various racial and ethnic groups. But after Jennifer House, a black woman in Los Angeles, perused one too many profiles only to find the guys had checked off every box except African American, she changed her strategy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Behind computer screens and cutely coded user names, people clearly communicate things about race that few would ever say aloud in a bar.</p>
<p>For example, a study published last year in Social Science Research examined 1,558 profiles that white daters living in or near big U.S. cities placed on Yahoo! Personals, which, much like Match, lists 10 racial and ethnic groups users can select as preferred dates. Among the women, 73% stated a preference. Of these, 64% selected whites only, while fewer than 10% included East Indians, Middle Easterners, Asians or blacks.</p>
<p>The story is a little different for the men, 59% of whom stated a racial preference. Of these, nearly half selected Asians, but fewer than 7% did for black women. Why? One theory offered by the study&rsquo;s lead author, Cynthia Feliciano, a sociologist at the University of California at Irvine, is that men&rsquo;s choices are influenced by the media&rsquo;s portrayal of Asian women as being hypersexual and black women as being bossy.</p>
<p>The people running OkCupid.com have a less nuanced explanation. {snip}</p>
<p>After attempting to control for attractiveness (using something OkCupid calls a picture-rating utility) and compatibility (on the basis of answers to questions covering everything from spirituality to dental hygiene), the study found that black women garnered the fewest responses of any female group. White women responded at much higher rates to white men than to men of color. Asian women&rsquo;s and Latinas&rsquo; response rates showed even stronger preferences for white men. {snip}</p>

<p>Lying on your profile and posting other people&rsquo;s pictures might get responses but do you honestly think it will land you a date? What do you think will happen when that guy who thinks he&rsquo;s getting a blond bombshell picks you up at your home and the door is answered by a Queen Latifa?</p>

		<p>Recalls to mind one of my most successful &#8220;bar experiments&#8221;. I had answered a couple of ads from women without ever hearing back from them. And written one of my own as well. Zilch! My two best customers and I were discussing what we thought was going wrong. <br>
  Then one of my female regulars came in for her after shift drink. I told her to write an ad pretending to be me but, being a woman, listing what she thought a woman would want to hear. Then sign my name to it. My ad being me got nothing. Her ad being me got about a gazillion responses. So many I let a GI friend  have some of the leftovers. I don`t know what it all  meant except that it worked!! </p>

		<p>Reminds me of when I was 16, close to half a century ago, and a man whose kids I was babysitting made a nasty remark about blacks and I turned up my ignorant nose.  He said, &#8220;Well, would you kiss a black guy?&#8221;  I was shocked and said, &#8220;No!&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Well, then you&rsquo;re as prejudiced as I am.&#8221;  I&rsquo;ve thought about that over the years, and finally realized that there&rsquo;s no sin in wanting to be intimate only with your own kind.  People can call it racist if they want; I call it preferring my own, and I believe I have the right to do that, as do all others.</p>

		<p>It is typical of Time magazine to portray it as a problem that white men and women prefer to date people of their own race.  It is vitally important to our media masters that the white race be eliminated as soon as possible.<br>

		<p>Uh-oh, time to step up the media propaganda for black/white mixing.  This obvious and detestable Racism must be stamped out at all cost.</p>
<p>But &#8220;Cynthia Feliciano&#8221; thinks that it&rsquo;s all due to stereotyping of Oriental (<i>not</i> &#8220;Asian&#8221;) women as &#8220;hypersexual?&#8221;  What TV shows can she have been watching?  I don&rsquo;t watch any at all, so no doubt I missed all those &#8220;media portrayals.&#8221;  </p>
<p>All the same, I have to wonder what media  Senora Feliciano is talking about.  Because the media I <i>do</i> see encourage both White men and White women to bed down with nonWhites of the darkest possible variety.<br>

<p>This sounds too much like a sugar coating on a bitter pill.  One reason a lot of White guys like Asian women, is Asian women are content to be women, and not interested in competing with men.  The &#8220;hypersexual&#8221; description is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned.  As for black women, even though they can be bossy, to the point of being obnoxious, the main reason most guys are not interested in them is very, very few even begin to approach what could be considered attractive.  Guys generally aren&rsquo;t interested in an ugly woman with attitude, unless the guy has head problems of his own.<br>

		<p>The media portrays black women as bossy??? I guess they had to make up some kind of excuse, as &#8220;Too ugly&#8221;, &#8220;not intelligent&#8221; and &#8220;high risk of STD&rsquo;s&#8221; are not very PC. like wise &#8220;Asian women as being hypersexual&#8221; does not ring true, they have sex appeal, but that is a far cry from &#8220;hypersexual&#8221;. If anything, it&rsquo;s black women who are hypersexual, just watch a few maury povich shows and that is clear. And I suspect the 7% of white men who selected <br>
black woman did so only out of whiteguilt. The truth is when it comes to black women, we&rsquo;re all like John Mayer</p>

		<p>The real reason we see so many White women with Black men is because Black men are the ones asking them out.</p>
<p>I listen to my wifes single female friends, and they are constantly complaining that the only men asking them out are Black.  These are women who want to go out with White men, but the White men arent asking.</p>
<p>The future belongs to the bold. Put down your beer and your video games, White man, and go get yourself a White woman, or 2 or three.</p>

		<p>People have their preferences.  Diversity indoctrination won&rsquo;t change that.  It is well known that black men like white women, and not just any white women, but blonde ones specifically.  How many white women with black hair have you seen with black men or being pursued by blacks?  Almost none.  </p>
<p>But if a white guy says he&rsquo;s into Asian chicks, whoa, stop the presses, he must be a creep or something!  If white women express a general preference for white males, then they are oppressed racists who are scared of their fathers, but if a black woman brings home a white man - the black family can express racism against whites in a way that if a white person said those things against blacks he would be run out of town!</p>
<p>Multiculturalists cannot stand it when people of a similar culture want to stick together, unless the race is non-white, then they support exclusiveness.  Only whites are REQUIRED to mix with others as a show of enlightenment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the media&rsquo;s portrayal of Asian women as being hypersexual and black women as being bossy&#8221;</p>
<p>I think Asian women (I&rsquo;m&rsquo; assuming Oriental here) are typically expected to be good wives and homemakers, not hypersexual.  The general consensus is that they treat their husbands better than white or black woman.  Rather like white men are generally expected to be better husbands and fathers than black or latino men.  </p>
<p>As for black woman being considered bossy - that is a really nice way of saying loud, rude, obnoxious, low class, uneducated, &#8216;loose&rsquo; and sloppy obese (not full-figured).  Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget the illegitimate child she probably has.  How the heck do you sell that!</p>
<p>What is really funny is that despite the MSM demonizing white men over the last 30-40 years and exalting black men the average person, of any race, knows the truth.<br>

<p>: There are a growing number on interracial couples, especailly under 35</p>

<p>: It is only natural that people want to graviate to those who look like them</p>

		<p>Well, this pretty much adheres to my own guidelines when dating online:  white men only.  While I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of nice asian men out there, I personally don&rsquo;t find asian men attractive. They just don&rsquo;t seem &#8220;masculine&#8221; enough to me. While I do find some black and Hispanic men attractive, I learned long ago that when you date these ethnic groups, you often have to deal with cheating, multiple children by multiple mothers, etc.  I&rsquo;ve also had white friends who have dated black men, only to be dumped because the boyfriend&rsquo;s black friends and family members did not approve.  Obviously there are &#8220;bad apples&#8221; in the white male dating pool, too.  But why increase my chances of being burned by also dating &#8220;minority&#8221; men who, culturally, don&rsquo;t typically value fidelity or responsibility for one&rsquo;s children?  Plus, blue eyes are the most beautiful, at least to me.  ;)  </p>
<p>Coincidentally, the handsome white man I am dating now feels exactly that way about black women, i.e. doesn&rsquo;t find them attractive in the least and thinks of them as &#8220;bossy.&#8221;  Media stereotype perhaps, but at least in my very diverse workplace, I can think of at least three instances where it&rsquo;s true-</p>

This is news to me.  I thought the stereotype of Asian women was shy and submissive.  When did they become nymphomaniacs?  Does anyone know?<br>
As far as black women being bossy, does &#8220;bossy&#8221; now mean low class and overweight?</p>

<p>This is pretty silly. If most of the women are white, it&rsquo;s not a surprise the largest group picked (64%) were asking for whites. The article isn&rsquo;t done in exactly the way one would expect an expose&rsquo; of interracial relationships to be undertaken. But if the investigation of &#8216;race&rsquo; is so important, why not visit any of the sites like BlackPlanet.com and see what race most singles pick? </p>

		<p>I got divorced when I was 30 and lived much of the next 6-7 years like a frat boy. I can tell some interesting tales about being a single white man in the DC area. But since this is a family site, let me just say that the premise of this article is correct. As long as you are not completely ugly, obese or dorky, a white man in the DC area will often get approached by non-white women - particularly Asians.</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit - I had Asian, Hispanic and even black women buy me drinks (unbidden) but never a white woman.</p>
<p>I am not a racial nationalist so this was not a problem for me (I simply hate the double standards and anti-white racism in the U.S. and that is why I support AR).</p>
<p>Oh, and I wish these anti-white sociology professors would get their stories straight. Just last week we had one such specimen complaining about black women in movies being typecast as either 300 pound welfare mammies or oversexed vixens. </p>
<p>Now we get this Cynthia Feliciano character chirping such words of wisdom as, &#8220;men&rsquo;s choices are influenced by the media&rsquo;s portrayal of Asian women as being hyper sexual and black women as being bossy.&#8221;</p>

<p>I would like a scientific answer for this.  My own theory is that on a very primal level, these women are choosing to get some white into their bloodlines, because whiteness conveys a superior genetic trait for survival of offspring.</p>
<p>White men with Asian or brown females usually have the appearance of meek losers, which reaffirms the theory that the females chose their race before choosing them as individuals.</p>

		<p>It seems like these articles appear every other week. The fact is that people are going to date and marry who they want. Some will date and marry accross racial lines, others will remain within their race.</p>

		<p>Studies have shown many times that more than 97% of White women will never date outside of their race. When reading these statistics we must remember that what women search for isn&rsquo;t what they actually want or get. Interracial relationships are thankfully still a very small minority of the population.</p>

Even black Marine in dress uniform passed us and commented &#8220;Oh no, Oh no&rsquo;. I never heard a negative comment from whites.

		<p>The fact is on average a White man is the best mate any woman could possibly have. They on average have the best combination of qualities needed in a mate. White men are the best looking, the most handsome of all men. White men have the best physiques and are the most masculine of all after West Africans and some Pacific islanders. And the men of both those groups have a pathetic reputation when it comes to their treatment of women, in taking responsibility of children and family etc&hellip; White men on average are the most intelligent in the world after North East Asian men. North East Asian men tend to be too introverted and shy when it comes to dating women. Besides East Asians, White men tend to treat their wives/ girlfriends better than all other males. Among all the civilizations in the world it is in Europe and the West in general where women have enjoyed the most rights and have been treated the best from ancient times. No wonder Latino, Indian, Asian etc&hellip; women desire White husbands. I am not surprised by this study at all. All those years of White male bashing in the media has had limited success.  <br>
Besides as far as black women are concerned unless the woman is extremely beautiful and far above the black average in intelligence and mannerisms, hardly any East Asian or White man is going to dream of a relationship with her.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing the excuses that liberals will come up with to explain black underachievement?  Even the fact that white men, in general, prefer white or Asian women must be chalked up to the fault of whitey&rsquo;s portrayal of black women in the media (which is currently what  &mdash;  as frumpy, sexless mammies?)  What is particularly jarring in this excuse  &mdash;  that Asians are seen as hypersexed  &mdash;  is that black women actually comprise the group that has been seen as this for thousands of years!  The authors of such nonsense know full well what most people think, and yet they make up laughably incredible hypotheses!</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;Uhuru Guru was arrested this morning at around 06h30 on trumped up charges regarding an alleged offence dating back to 1993. His door was ripped off, his wife was not allowed to make calls, his children&rsquo;s cell phones were confiscated, his little daughters were were ripped out of their beds, you cannot believe the cruety</p>
<p>A massive contingent of police from no less than five different specialist units, ranging from Organised Crime, Cyber crime, vehicle theft, etc; raided his home and confiscated all his computer equipment&hellip;.This arrest is motivated ultimately by the State. No doubt it has to do with zasucks&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;For example, a study published last year in Social Science Research examined 1,558 profiles that white daters living in or near big U.S. cities placed on Yahoo! Personals, which, much like Match, lists 10 racial and ethnic groups users can select as preferred dates. Among the women, 73% stated a preference. Of these, 64% selected whites only, while fewer than 10% included East Indians, Middle Easterners, Asians or blacks.</p>
<p>The story is a little different for the men, 59% of whom stated a racial preference. Of these, nearly half selected Asians, but fewer than 7% did for black women. Why? One theory offered by the study&rsquo;s lead author, Cynthia Feliciano, a sociologist at the University of California at Irvine, is that men&rsquo;s choices are influenced by the media&rsquo;s portrayal of Asian women as being hypersexual and black women as being bossy.&#8221; </p>
<p>Maybe this will finally put to rest the idea that many white women seek black males.  The biggest race mixers are not white women and black males.  Sixty four percent of white women preferred white males while 60% of white males preferred a race and 1/2 of that was for asian women.  So the other half prefers white or some other race.  Many white males are in denial that they are rapidly going extinct.  It&rsquo;s true that small amounts of white women breed out.  The biggest problem for whites in a multiracial country is that white males are so largely desired by all races of women.  It&rsquo;s hard for a woman of any race to attract a white male because they have so many women competing for them.  Our future looks Brazilian with each passing decade.</p>

		<p>I grew up in white bread, small town America where there were no minorities to speak of.  I had mixed results in the dating game due to the relatively small pool of girls available.  When I moved to the large, almost completely non-white urban area I live in now, I have been given the &#8216;look&rsquo; and the once-over (and twice over) by so many minority women it&rsquo;s uncanny.</p>
<p>I remember my first experience with this: I was standing in line at the post office, and I was the only white guy in the place - tall, muscular, auburn blond-streaked hair, all-American guy, etc - this korean woman was staring at me so hard I became physically uncomfortable.  I thought she was going to jump my bones right there!  When I looked around I noticed several other young women checking me out and smiling.  I had never experienced anything like that in my life, and for the last several years it&rsquo;s been quite common.  (Where I work there are lots of Latina women and they flirt with me so much my head is literally spinning most days.  To a woman they all complain to me about &#8220;Latin&#8221; guys and how bad they are.)</p>
<p>Everywhere I go, I&rsquo;m the only white guy around, and as a previous poster noted, non-white women will approach and flirt with incredible frequency.  When I read the results of the survey mentioned above - that white guys are basically the top of the dating chain - it didn&rsquo;t surprise me.  If you throw in education and a good job, we&rsquo;ve got some amazing position.</p>
<p>The diversity/social justice crowd is trying so hard to tear white males down and make us the villains in all things (a la Avatar), yet as another posted noted, of all the men in the world, among which you will find good and bad, you are more likely to find a good, reliable, moral, chivalrous and upwardly mobile man among white men than among all others.  Women of all races know this &#8220;facts on the ground&#8221; truth, and even uber liberal women usually go for a white guy, too!</p>

		<p>Working in a California university that is about 40 percent Asian, I certainly have noticed how all the Asian girls are madly pursuing the White men and avoiding the Asian men.</p>
<p>It is totally selfish.  The asian girls want green cards and the height, white skin and blue eyes and light hair genes for their children.</p>
<p>Funny thing, in all those years I have never seen an Asian girl with a dark skinned white man, and very few white men with black hair.</p>
<p>They seem to go for first height and then fair skin and then brown hair.  It has been explained to me that the Asian preference for height is because in Asia, short stature means one is from a family of starving peasants or proletarians.</p>

I don&rsquo;t attribute it to the media, but to the fact that demographic is mostly who I work around and I&rsquo;m a hell of a guy.  Too many genaralizations about who is attractive and who is not.

		<p>This article sure has attracted a lot of comments.</p>
<p>I want to point out to those reading that if you support the point of view promoted by American Renaissance, then choosing to marry within your own race is much more than simply a &#8220;preference,&#8221; it&rsquo;s more than a gut reaction towards who you find attractive.</p>
<p>Consciously dating and most of all marrying within your race is based on the idea that some, if not most, of what makes us who we are lies within our DNA. </p>
<p>When we whites marry and have children with other whites we are furthering a racial line and all the history that goes with it - the culture, the languages, the technological creations, all the marvels that whites have produced. This is more than a matter of mere dating &#8220;preferences&#8221; - there is something special and unique about white people (as there is about all the races) that is worth being proud of, cherishing and wanting to see survive and thrive. When you feel that special attraction towards someone of your own race, perhaps the right way to think of it is as a deep seated evolutionary drive to see your line continue, to see your grandchildren born looking like you and growing up to think like you.</p>
<p>Besides this very basic point, there are all kinds of downsides to marrying outside your race. Culturally speaking, the white children of white parents are raised with a sense of being whole and at peace with who they are. Also, a white woman partnered with a white man knows that she is valued for who she is - as an individual - and not as a &#8220;trophy,&#8221; i.e. as a white female prize coveted almost universally by third worlders.</p>
<p>I could go on. The benefits of dating and marrying within your race far, far outstrip whatever might be enticing about the novelty of marrying into another race.</p>

<p>To 46 - Anonymous: Yeah, some Asians just want a green card, but my wife wasn&rsquo;t one of them. As for there being so many white women wanting good white men, I wonder where they are. They sure don&rsquo;t seem to be many around here, the ones that are don&rsquo;t seem to be interested in a guy unless he makes $50,000+. The attractive, intelligent, sane ones all seem to be taken already, or maybe I am just a &#8220;loser&#8221;. :)</p>
<p>And as far as black women go, almost all around are unatractive or fat or low class or too religious for me. The remaining few I wouldn&rsquo;t marry because of various reasons stated by other posters, plus the hard time mixed race kids have being accepted, even by their own parents.

<p>You&rsquo;re on to something.  </p>
<p>If I were seeking or had serious political power, I wouldn&rsquo;t frame the interracial marriage issue in negative terms, i.e. you, white man, can&rsquo;t get with a black woman, or vice versa.  I would frame it in a positive light, like you just did.  It would be a matter of extolling the virtues of intra-racial relationship for whites (and by deduction, everyone else, but my concern would be for whites.)  The reason I exclusively engage in intra-racial relationships with white women is because I know there&rsquo;s more to a relationship that has a chance of making it than just carnal pleasure.  I know a white woman has the same kind of soul that I have.  I just couldn&rsquo;t have the same sort of depth of a complex emotional and spiritual partnership with non-white women.</p>
<p>I have found in the political arena, positive arguments sell better than negative ones. I happen to think that social arguments for intra-racial relationships are more effective in the long run than legal arguments for formal laws against inter-racial relationships.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Race traitor&rsquo; seem a bit of a harsh term, and my goodness, doesn&rsquo;t that suggest some sort of insecurity?</p>
<p>I so agree with you, #41!<br>
&#8220;This site is supposed to advocate for white rights and realism in regards to race relations. I&rsquo;m all for appreciating one&rsquo;s race and civilization, but I&rsquo;m not into the supremacy movement. I don&rsquo;t think that is what Amren&rsquo;s about.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
What are you talking about?? Whoever said anything about the &#8220;supremacy&#8221; movement?  A race traitor is a race traitor, period. That means going with a person of another race. Is this not what the whole article was about? How does one advocate for White rights and realism in regards to race relations if not mentioning the fact of interracial relationships?  Obviously you are for those relationships if that was your response so where is your advocacy for the White race? </p>

		<p>Per poster #55, I too married an Asian woman (north Indian) and she looks white with very caucasian features and our kids are as white as they come with white skin, regular european facial features and light hair.  I did not feel alarm bells marrying her because she grew up in this country and is more well-versed in Americana than I ever could be.  We both follow the rhythms of white civilization as the norm in our house and my kids by themselves have decided that they do not like other, lesser cultures, so in my case I feel I have a success story.</p>
<p>The problems occur, I believe, if you marry someone who looks too different racially, so much so that your kids will not be able to move naturally in the society you want them to (such as black/white pairings).  If you add very loud cultural noise then the problem is exacerbated.  For example, if you marry a latina, even if she looks 100% white and has the ancestry to back it up, but then she is into all that salsa and merengue stuff - essentially pushing a loud and gregarious latino identity, then your kids will grow up thinking they are latino and not white American.  I feel that a little interracial marriage is fine for the white community, as long as it is small, manageable and the non-whites coming in subscribe to the values of white civilization.  I know some on this board are racial purists to the max, but they could mellow just a little.</p>

<p>#40 Can&rsquo;t agree. In my current job, I have a black female supervisor. From the start (during my probationary period) I told her I was a White nationalist and in my younger days wanted to go fight as a merc in Rhodesia to support the White government. She&rsquo;s traveled to Africa herself and said she appreciated my honesty; when it came to hiring me permanently, she voted &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </p>

No, you don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re disrespecting your wife by thinking that her Indian-ness is &#8220;lesser&#8221;. It&rsquo;s part of who she is but you simply want to force White culture to mask it all. Why didn&rsquo;t you find a White woman? Either this article is wrong (possible), or (more likely) many of you personally have had trouble attracting White women, so you go for Asians.</p>

		<p>Well, this pretty much adheres to my own guidelines when dating online:  white men only.  While I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of nice asian men out there, I personally don&rsquo;t find asian men attractive. They just don&rsquo;t seem &#8220;masculine&#8221; enough to me. While I do find some black and Hispanic men attractive, I learned long ago that when you date these ethnic groups, you often have to deal with cheating, multiple children by multiple mothers, etc.  I&rsquo;ve also had white friends who have dated black men, only to be dumped because the boyfriend&rsquo;s black friends and family members did not approve.  Obviously there are &#8220;bad apples&#8221; in the white male dating pool, too.  But why increase my chances of being burned by also dating &#8220;minority&#8221; men who, culturally, don&rsquo;t typically value fidelity or responsibility for one&rsquo;s children?  Plus, blue eyes are the most beautiful, at least to me.  ;)  </p>
<p>Coincidentally, the handsome white man I am dating now feels exactly that way about black women, i.e. doesn&rsquo;t find them attractive in the least and thinks of them as &#8220;bossy.&#8221;  Media stereotype perhaps, but at least in my very diverse workplace, I can think of at least three instances where it&rsquo;s true-</p>

		<p><i>One theory offered by the study&rsquo;s lead author, Cynthia Feliciano, a sociologist at the University of California at Irvine, is that men&rsquo;s choices are influenced by the media&rsquo;s portrayal of Asian women as being hypersexual and black women as being bossy.</i></p>
<p>Once again we see how our learned betters in the universities inhabit some sort of weird parallel universe.  Where oh where does the media portray Asian women as hypersexualized?  And has it occurred to Professor Feliciano that maybe we white men get our impressions of both Asian and black women from real life, we don&rsquo;t need the media to instruct us on this matter?  What I see in real life is that black women are indeed very often loud, brash, argumentative, and quick to take offense.  Add to that the fact that damn few of them are even pretty.  It&rsquo;s no wonder to me that even black men don&rsquo;t want to marry them.  As for Asian women, what attracts men to them is not that they are &#8220;hypersexualized&#8221;, but that they are often intelligent and feminine at the same time, and are relatively easy to get along with.  Few men want to marry a porn star.  If anything it is young white women that our media likes to portray as hypersexualized, jumping into bed with any number of white or black men, or, for that matter, white or Asian women.  Our media has a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>Now, before the white women in this forum jump on me for writing this   &mdash;   no, I am neither dating nor married to an Asian woman.  But, being short, middle aged, and far from rich, I have few illusions I&rsquo;ll find a white woman with any interest in me.</p>

<p>Maybe when it comes to dating, but when Whites settle into marriage, 97% marry other Whites.  Dating is, of course, a very different situation from the permanency of marriage.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In the U.S., according to the Census Bureau, about 97% of married non-Hispanic whites in the U.S. are married to other non-Hispanic whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>AND:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Less than 0.5% of married whites are wed to African-Americans&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
This may be changing&hellip;or maybe not.  There will be more information when the results of the next census come out in a year or two and we&rsquo;ll have more information as to whether the percentage of interracial marriages has increased, decreased or remained the same.  </p>
<p>You can be sure that the percentage of the White population, however, has decreased.</p>

<p>Those marriage stats may be accurate, but they are misleading. Look at the natality statistics on the CDC website. In 2006, nearly 10 percent of babies born to non-hispanic white women had hispanic, black or &#8220;other&#8221; fathers. That is frightening.<br>

<p>What is even more frightening is that so many young Whites are emulating black and hispanic low-class behavior by having many of these babies outside of marriage (or any stable relationship).  The illegitimacy rate for Whites is a little more than 30% at the moment (blacks up to 70%, hispanics over 50%).  Over 50% of children grow up without a father  &mdash;  this is devastating and I see the effects in the schools every day of angry, feral, out of control teenage boys, with no governor on their frontal lobes, mother sobbing in the front office (with four little children in tow) that she &#8216;can&rsquo;t do anything with her son.&rsquo;  These children are fodder for gangs, gun violence, drug use and eventually LWOP (Life Without Parole).  Well, at least with LWOP, they (hopefully) won&rsquo;t be reproducing.</p>
<p>A young, single mother cannot raise a boy to be a man, despite what the Welfare State and the Feminazis tell us.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the CDCs figures are true, just from looking around, from obvious empirical evidence.  Also the government encourages miscegenation, no doubt about it, (for Whites of course), in an effort to either eradicate us or greatly reduce our numbers.</p>
<p>With that knowledge, we must become like the Jewish people and strongly discourage our sons and daughters from marrying outside our race.</p>
<p>As yourselves:  Is it good for Whites?</p>
<p>This is what I ask every single day.</p>

		<p>Poster #64- it&rsquo;s only frightening if you really CARE about these individual low self-esteemed white women. I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not worth my time. If the stats were around 25 or 30 percent, then I might get concerned. Look at the natality rates and find out from these &#8220;white&#8221; women who crossed racial lines to see their extenuating circumstances. Most probably will not be with the man (especially if he&rsquo;s black) in a year or two. That is more of a personal responsibility issue if you ask me. Plus they are probably extremely poor. What high-society white women marry black men? Unless he&rsquo;s an athlete or musician or something. I think it&rsquo;s more of a class issue than deliberate miscegenation. I prefer my white wife. What a novel idea, huh?</p>

		<p>You were all misled!</p>
<p>I located the <a>study</a> that Jenee Desmond-Harris in Time magazine used to claim that white men with a dating racial preference mostly prefer Asian women.  She was misleading you.  Her article seems to suggest that 59% of white men have a racial preference, nearly half prefer Asian women to the exclusion of all other groups, and less than 7% prefer black women to the exclusion of all other groups.  The implication is that more men prefer Asian women than prefer white women.  The actual study by Feliciano et al documented exclusion, not preference.  93.8% of white men who excluded based on race excluded black women.  53.3% excluded Asian women.  Only 6.8% excluded white women, and 28.9% preferred white women to the exclusion of all other groups.  The non-white group that was the least excluded by both white men and women was Latinos, 48.2% for white men and 76.5% for white women, among those who excluded.  Thus, white men are neither as interested in Asian women nor in black women as Desmond-Harris led you to believe.</p>
<p>Time magazine and American Renaissance should highlight this correction.</p>

<p>I actually agree with you, Francois. I am no fan of blacks but it must be a slap in the face (to say the least) that so many black men choose non-black women. Even many black racists - Skip Gates, Bryant Gumbel, Ice T, Wesley Snipes, Dennis Rodman, Russell Simmons &hellip;etc, marry non-black women. </p>
<p>They are allegedly pro-black but can&rsquo;t even take the most basic step to alleviate the most pressing problem in the black community - legions of lonely black women.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t all little girls grow up wanting to get married and have kids some day? Don&rsquo;t all parents hope thier daughters will find  a nice guy to look after them when they are gone?</p>
<p>We might be heading toward a time when the possibility of marriage or even a boyfriend will simply not be an option for most black women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% sure whitey will eventually get blamed for this. But it is still very sad.<br>
