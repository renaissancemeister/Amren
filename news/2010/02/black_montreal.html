<h1>Black Montreal Residents Claim Racial Profiling on Transit</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Irwin Block, Montreal Gazette, February 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two groups of black residents of southwest Montreal are filing complaints with the Quebec Human Rights Commission, saying they were racially profiled and abused by transportation officials.</p>
<p>In both cases, the residents claim they were mistreated in November after failing to show proof they had bought transit tickets.</p>
<p>Samantha Hyman-Roberts said she and two friends were returning home from work when they were singled out by inspectors.</p>
<p>Her friends had their passes, but Hyman-Roberts said she&rsquo;d discarded her ticket.</p>
<p>The inspectors then told her it was &#8220;illegal&#8221; to use transit without a pass, and ordered her to get off at the next stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;They put on their gloves, grabbed me and dragged me to the ground in the train. They then dragged me onto the (next) platform,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They put their knees on my back and tried to put handcuffs on my wrists. I was screaming that I was in pain and they ignored me,&#8221; said Hyman-Roberts. &#8220;They picked me up, slammed me against the wall and threw me inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>She accused the officials of racial profiling, before they handed her a $214 ticket for not having proof of payment and $324 for obstruction.</p>
<p>Hyman-Roberts and her two friends are asking the commission for $50,000 in damages.</p>
<p>In the second case, Gallo Cham and his friend also claim they were targeted by inspectors because they are black, asking for $30,000 in damages.</p>
<p>Cham got a $214 fine for using transit without a ticket.</p>
<p>But Montreal Transit Commission official Marianne Rouette was quick to deny the allegations.</p>
<p>&#8220;To my knowledge they don&rsquo;t single out people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The two complaints will be filed Monday.<br>

		<p>My, this sounds familiar.  Blacks everywhere are the universal punching bags, always getting arrested at perhaps ten to twenty times the rate of whites and Asians, always being singled out for abuse and false accusations, and always being imprisoned on trumped up felony charges and overflowing the prison systems.</p>
<p>Any fool can see that they are always victims of injustice borne of racism.  Mostly, it&rsquo;s those racist swine who associate with them every day who harbor these distorted views.  Good decent people, isolated in their safe suburbs or behind the ivy-covered walls of academia, realize how truly blameless they are.</p>

		<p>The trick is to always allege racism or racial profiling   whenever your are caught dead bang  running a scam or breaking the law.  This is a universally used tactic in  some communities.</p>

		<p>  I entirely disagree with the initial comment posted with regard to this matter.  I have not ridden the Montréal transit system (autrefois « the Métro»), for many years; at least upon an regular basis. And I am unfamiliar with the modifications and adjustments that may have been made with regard to how tickets are sold. In «the old days.» One paid one&rsquo;s fare and entered the system.  Now, one pays one,s fare, and a machine issues a ticket which is valid for three hours I believe.  </p>
<p> The previous system was «old fashioned;»  making disproportionate use of «deadwood» human personnel; the present system is more «mechanized,» but still procedurally redundant.  However,  blacks have a long, long history of creating problems and committing crimes in the metro.  </p>
<p>  The area of the city where the plaintiffs are from «south - west» Montréal,  is the infamous «St. Charles/St. Henri,  district. Predominantly black,  and, inevitably, impoverished, and an veritable «creche» of criminality and troublemaking. Just like black neighbourhoods all over the world!!</p>
<p>  When I lived in Montréal in the mid 1990&rsquo;s, the Place St. Henri/Atwater interchange was an dangerous place; especially for white adolescents and teenagers.  Blacks would hang around the station, and rob young whites of their clothing; in those days,  clothes, and shoes. The assaults were often quite violent. But, the anglophone media, (in particular), collaborated with «the authorities» to keep such incidents out of the public eye. </p>
<p>  One must also consider the fact that,  whether one is in New York or Chicago, or London, or even,  the Moscow metro (otherwise the «Kaganovich Metro,» named after the individual responsible for it&rsquo;s construction, the ferocious Lazar Kaganovich), blacks are world beating fare beaters.  They leap turnstiles,  try to ride on expired tickets,  and generally seek to «beat the system.»  «Racial profiling» in this instance, is not «prejudicial;» it is just common sense.</p>
<p>  I also fail to see how an individual,  who uses urban mass transit regularly,  would fail to have a transit pass. The conclusion of the news item,  aired on «Montréal at Six,» stated that «from now on,» (sic),  the «victim» would carry an pass, known, at least by it&rsquo;s initials as the «OPUS» pass. But,  why did this person not obtain such a pass before? It appears this is,  as well as the usual exposition of black greed and ulterior intention to «cash in» on putative accusations of «racism,» yet another example of how blacks demonstrate an degree of personal irresponsibility,  negligence and incompetence, disproportionate to other races.  Blacks,  whereever they are in the world, are, invariably,  the most urban of peoples; and yet,  they exhibit an very high degree of incompetence with regard to how to exist and to conduct themselves in an urban environment. </p>
<p>  Perhaps the attitude and the behavior of the «transit police» (or whoever they are, I have never seen such persons), was excessive. But (but), one must consider that, if such persons have been deployed in the metro, it msu be as an direct (direct) consequence of black criminality and law breaking in the mass transit system. </p>

<p>Here in New York blacks ride the Long Island Railroad without paying; when caught they all claim they must have lost the ticket somewhere.   </p>

<p>St. Louis has a light rail system that has a fare-paying honor system like that you described for Montréal.  You either buy a ticket at a box at the station, validate it, and board with it, or you have a valid monthly/weekly/daily pass from the transit system (including the buses), or you have a transfer from a bus.  The transit system has a crew of &#8220;security guards&#8221; (like many of the bus drivers, affirmative action black women) who will from time to time come around and ask riders for their valid payment.  If you don&rsquo;t have one, they write you a summons to go to municipal court in the jursidiction where the violation happened (MetroLink runs through three, St. Louis County MO, St. Louis City MO, St. Clair County IL) where you&rsquo;ll have to pay a fine anywhere from $50 to $100 depending on the judge&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
<p>And of course, almost all of those given summonses are black.  St. Louis&rsquo;s civil rights industry hasn&rsquo;t made a big deal of it yet, but they soon will I predict.</p>
<p>When Metro Link started in 1994, a regular M-F to-and-fro passenger would get checked on average once a week.  As of 2008, it was twice a week, because the transit system was/is suffering budget shortfalls and wants to crack down on fare jumpers.  Or, more accurately, get a cut of that fine money.<br>

		<p>If they had been hassled, and had their tickets they may have a complaint. Bottom line they did not have a ticket.</p>

<p>While I mostly agree with all parts of this statement, I believe the black way is to try to intimidate, deny, cry foul, or otherwise bully their way to their destination, which they do with innate competence. </p>
<p>They are satisfied if they achieve partial success with these methods, which they often do.</p>

<p>Maybe it happened like she said it happened but then again, maybe she got belligerant and combative and they had to use force.<br>

		<p>reading this, I am glad to live in a german city where there are no turnstiles, monthly passes are reasonably priced, ticket checks are infrequent, checkers are respectful, and fines are low (40 euros).</p>
<p>the system functions reasonably well because people are reasonably civilized and abuse is relatively infrequent. </p>
<p>equally important, eliminating barriers and turnstiles makes the public feel as though the system belongs to them, is a public amenity. </p>

		<p>Here we go again&hellip; and again&hellip; and still again&hellip; Whenever a Black is accused of breaking the law, no matter how trivial or serious the offense&hellip; it&rsquo;s always racial profiling! The irony being we&rsquo;re supposed to think of this race of whiners as our equals&hellip; treating them with dignity and respect; solemnly accepting them as &#8220;our best friends.&#8221; An engraved in stone taboo our children were taught from infancy onwards, never to break.</p>

<p>A subway system with no manned ticket booths operates on a kind of honor system. Even with ticket-checkers riding the trains, a certain level of honesty is required from the paying public to make it work. And apparently blacks lack sufficient honor or they wouldn&rsquo;t keep getting ticketed for these offenses at rates greater than any other ethnic group. </p>
<p>Of course, on traditional transit systems with humans in booths like NYC, blacks are also notorious for getting caught jumping turnstiles, etc, at rates greater than any other ethnic group. </p>
<p>Whatever fare-taking method whitey tries to use so people can get to work cheaply, blacks have to try to game the system. And thanks to Canada&rsquo;s insane &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; Commissions, these Montreal blacks are trying to game the system not just for free subway rides, but for $30,000! </p>
