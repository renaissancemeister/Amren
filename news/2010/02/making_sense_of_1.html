<p>&#8220;The differences in average intelligence that evolved between the human races have been a major factor in the course of human history and prehistory. Any theory that ignores these differences, or denies their existence, will therefore be unable to explain various major aspects of history.&#8221; So begins Michael Hart&rsquo;s ambitious and remarkably successful account of who did what  &mdash;  and more importantly why  &mdash;  over the last 30,000 years.</p>
<p>This is first and foremost a history book, which attempts to cover in a single volume everything of real importance that happened up until modern times. This would be a challenge even for a professional historian, but Dr. Hart, whose PhD is in astronomy, carries it off gracefully and engagingly. No doubt his experience as a teacher of history of science and his research for an earlier book on the 100 men he considers the most important in human history were useful preparation. This is a good, concise study of the main events of our past.</p>
<p>What sets Dr. Hart apart is his analysis of history in the light of racial differences in intelligence. Just as Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen can solve problems that baffle development economists because they understand race and IQ (see &#8220;Survival of the Fittest,&#8221; AR, June 2007), Dr. Hart finds patterns and offers explanations for what would otherwise seem random.</p>
<p><cite>Understanding Human History</cite> therefore begins with an introduction to race, intelligence, and genetics. After an excellent summary, Dr. Hart writes that &#8220;the overall evidence in favor of this conclusion [that there is a substantial genetic contribution to racial differences in average IQ] is so great that no one would dispute the point if it were not an issue that aroused strong emotions on ideological grounds.&#8221; Both the past and present make much more sense once it is understood that human populations that evolved in the demandingly cold environments of Europe and North Asia are more intelligent than those that were not winnowed by the challenges of surviving cold winters. (See &#8220;Northwest Passage,&#8221; AR, June 2006, for a review of this theory.)</p>
<p><b>Out of Africa</b></p>
<p>All authorities agree that <i>Homo sapiens</i> first appeared in Africa approximately 100,000 years ago and then migrated to the other continents. Dr. Hart gives a good description of what is known about evolution from Homo erectus on, and traces early human migration routes in some detail. The indigenous populations of Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia, for example, were never out of warm climates on their way out of Africa, and therefore did not evolve high intelligence. Dr. Hart notes that these populations are all more closely related to each other than to North Asians, and that the latter are actually more closely related to Caucasians than to Southeast Asians.</p>
<p>The effects on intelligence of having left sub-Saharan Africa for more demanding environments began to appear at the end of the Paleolithic period. Dr. Hart notes that such stone-age inventions as cave painting, sewing needles, bows and arrows, harpoons, fishhooks, and pottery, which appeared from 13,000 to 32,000 years ago, all arose well north of the Sahara.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest change in human life, however, occurred during what is called the Neolithic revolution, or the transition to agriculture. Until then, humans lived at the subsistence level in hunter-gatherer bands of 20 to 80. The switch to farming meant that people could grow more food than their families could eat, and this surplus led to the rise of specialized trades and crafts, and the establishment of cities. Human life changed dramatically.</p>
<p>Farming first began 10,000 to 11,000 years ago, with the domestication of wild wheat and barley in the Fertile Crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates. The first farm animals were goats, followed by sheep and pigs. Cattle and horses, which are larger and harder to tame came later. Dogs were probably domesticated about the time farming began, but cats were probably not domesticated for another 6,000 years.</p>
<p>Dr. Hart writes that farming spread from the Middle East to Europe and Africa, but that it arose independently in China and in Central America. Dr. Hart notes that it also began independently in the isolated highlands of New Guinea, but many thousands of years later than in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The cities and specialized trades that agriculture could support eventually led to another critically important development: writing. Invented around 3,400 BC in Sumeria (now in Southern Iraq), writing first appeared as cumbersome pictograms  &mdash;  the Egyptians developed their version around 3,100 BC. The first proper alphabet was for a north Semitic language, and did not appear until around 1,600 BC. This was the source of the famous Phoenician alphabet, from which both Greek and Latin script are probably derived. The Chinese invented writing independently of the Middle East  &mdash;  probably around 1,500 BC  &mdash;  as did the Central American Indians around 700 BC.</p>
<p>The Middle East was therefore the source for some of the most vitally important human breakthroughs: farming, writing, irrigation, metalworking, weaving, the alphabet, the arch, iron-making, and glass-making. For some 4,000 years, until the Greeks caught up around 300 BC, the Middle East was the most advanced place on earth. If the Hart thesis is correct, and intelligence is higher in cold climates, why did these advances not take place first in Europe or North Asia?</p>
<p>Dr. Hart argues that the critical first step  &mdash;  agriculture  &mdash;  required three things: a population of sufficiently high intelligence, a long growing season, and the presence of promising food crops. Europe had only the first of these, and therefore both the concept of agriculture and the crops themselves had to be introduced from the Middle East. It was not until some 5,000 years after agriculture began in the Fertile Crescent that it finally reached the northernmost parts of Europe. In China, there were good food crops  &mdash;  millet and rice  &mdash;  but the growing season was short. The inhabitants were nevertheless smart enough to adopt agriculture independently not long after it appeared in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Farming arose in Central America several thousand years later but not, writes Dr. Hart, because of low intelligence of the inhabitants. The MesoAmericans had come across the Alaska land bridge, and spent a good part of their evolutionary history in cold climates. What delayed agriculture was the absence of promising grains. The wild ancestor of today&rsquo;s corn, teosinte, took thousands of years of domestication to become a satisfactory food crop.</p>
<p>The Middle East&rsquo;s head start in agriculture led to many advances over other parts of the world. This, says Dr. Hart, is why it pulled so far ahead of more northerly areas where the inhabitants were more intelligent.</p>
<p><b>The Indo-Europeans</b></p>
<p>The most influential group of humans who ever lived may have been the Indo-Europeans. A combination of linguistic research and archeology traces their origins to perhaps 6,000 years ago, in the area north of the Black and Caspian Seas. Some people believe the first speakers of a proto-Indo-European language may have been the Kurgan people. Whoever they were, by about the time of Christ, the Indo-Europeans were &#8220;the tribe that conquered a continent.&#8221; Dr. Hart points out that they conquered far more than that. Not only did they populate Europe, they were most of the population of Persia, Afghanistan, and Central Asia, established the Roman and Parthian empires, and controlled most of the Middle East and North Africa. By 200 AD, however, their expansion came to an end, and the Indo-Europeans later lost control of North Africa and the Middle East, and Europe itself was threatened by Huns, Arabs, and Mongols. It was only by about 1500 that Indo-Europeans  &mdash;  in this case, the European branch of that group  &mdash;  regained the initiative. Dr. Hart is unequivocal: it was the intelligence Indo-Europeans had evolved to survive cold climates that permitted their extraordinary expansion.</p>
<p>Greece and Rome are, of course, the iconic Indo-European achievements of antiquity. The real flowering of Greek genius, and the contributions of almost all of the names we associate with the golden age, were during what amounted to a very short period: from the first war against Persia in 546 BC until the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. It was during this century and a half that Greeks laid the foundations of Western Civilization, and their achievements in science, astronomy, and mathematics were not surpassed for another 1,600 years. Some would say their philosophy and drama are still unsurpassed. Dr. Hart argues that the Greeks were probably no more intelligent than other Europeans, but merely benefited from geography: They were close enough to Egypt and the Middle East to build on the best knowledge then available.</p>
<p>It is not easy to credit this explanation. Most of the great figures of ancient Greece lived in Athens, a city-state that probably never had an adult male citizen population of more than 20,000 (the total population, including slaves, may have been 150,000 or more), and the contributions to world knowledge of this tiny group is surely more disproportionate than any other. We may never fully understand what gave rise to Greek genius.</p>
<p>In the case of Rome, it is the decline that baffles historians. Most empires have been overwhelmed by superior power, but the Romans were defeated by peoples far less advanced than themselves, who fielded armies much smaller than ones Rome had beaten in the past. Dr. Hart catalogues some of the causes of the collapse  &mdash;  replacement of the national religion by Christianity, increasing multi-nationalism that undercut patriotism, widespread corruption  &mdash;  but we are still left with a mystery. Whatever the explanation, the abdication of the last Roman emperor in 476 AD marked the beginning of the Dark Ages, during which Europe lost its position as the most advanced part of the world, and fell behind both the Arabs and the Chinese.</p>
<p>What was Rome&rsquo;s greatest contribution to the West? Unlike those who cite law and engineering, Dr. Hart argues that Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s legalization of Christianity in 313 AD and its subsequent spread throughout the empire was Rome&rsquo;s most significant legacy.</p>
<p>The destruction of Rome was not the first time a civilization was laid waste by barbarians who took centuries to reach the level of the people they had conquered. The 12th century BC Dorian invaders who later created Greek civilization destroyed the earlier Mycenaean culture and plunged Greece into a &#8220;dark age&#8221; that lasted 300 years. In both cases, the conquerers could not read the writing of the conquered, and this slowed their absorption of higher civilization.</p>
<p><b>The Modern Era</b></p>
<p>By about 1100, Europe had recovered its strength and was pushing back the Muslims. The Crusades, begun in 1099, brought Europe into close contact with Arabs, and led to the reintroduction of classical Greek science and mathematics. These rediscoveries were an important impetus to the Renaissance, and by the 12th century, Europe had begun great cathedrals such as Notre Dame. The Balkans, under Muslim rule, did not benefit from the Renaissance, nor did Russia, which was isolated and controlled by Mongols, but by 1450 Europe had regained its position as world leader.</p>
<p><cite>Understanding Human History</cite> concludes with an account of the modern era. After Gutenberg invented movable type in the 15th century (type was already in use in China but unknown in the West), virtually every significant advance in industry, science, and navigation was made by Europeans.</p>
<p>In this context, Dr. Hart asks why Europe and not China? The Chinese were as intelligent as whites, and had been well ahead of Europe for centuries. In Kubilai Kahn&rsquo;s time, China must have seemed the most promising candidate for progress. Dr. Hart notes, however, that the Chinese language, with its thousands of ideograms, is not suited to printing (which is why movable type was not widely used in China), whereas all European languages benefited enormously from the printing press. He adds that the Chinese had never shown much interest in astronomy or mathematics, which became the basis for the Scientific Revolution. China also had a relatively small coastline and extensive internal trade, so did not have the same need as Europe for navigation and exploration. Finally, China was unified and at peace, whereas the warring kingdoms of Europe were always looking for better weapons.</p>
<p>The Scientific Revolution in Europe nevertheless raises other questions. During the Renaissance, the continent&rsquo;s best minds were devoted to the arts and humanities. Why, beginning in the 1600s, did they turn to science? Dr. Hart suggests that the heliocentrism controversy caught the European imagination because it was far more than a scientific problem. By redefining man&rsquo;s place in the universe, it challenged the Catholic church. Dr. Hart suggests that it was this 50-year controversy that directed European thinking towards astronomy, mathematics, and the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Dr. Hart raises a similar question about the Industrial Revolution. Why in England? He writes that only England met all of the following criteria: It had a high average IQ. It did not practice slavery, and therefore had a built-in need for labor-saving advances. It had gone through the intellectual ferment of the Renaissance and Reformation, which stimulated free thinking. It was united  &mdash;  unlike Germany or Italy  &mdash;  and had, in effect, an internal free-trade zone. It had plenty of coal and iron ore. Finally, it had a tradition of property rights, which meant that the profits of industrialization would stay in the pockets of entrepreneurs and risk-takers. It was, of course, the Industrial Revolution that led to the dominance of Europe over the rest of the world.</p>
<p><b>Other Contributions</b></p>
<p>Dr. Hart evaluates the achievements of other peoples of the past. The Arabs, for example, he finds notable for their conquests. In just the hundred years from Mohammed&rsquo;s death in 632 to the battle of Tours in 732, Muslims had conquered Turkey, Afghanistan, parts of Central Asia, all of North Africa, a large part of Persia, the Iberian peninsula, and were stopped only in central France. This is a remarkable record, but Dr. Hart argues that because most of these conquests did not last, they must have been achieved only because their targets were temporarily weak, not because the Arabs were strong. He adds that although Arabs produced remarkable architecture, lyric poetry, and decorative arts, they added very little to science, mechanics, or astronomy. Although they were more advanced than Europeans from about 600 to 1300, they did not progress beyond the science of the Greeks, nor did they invent anything significant.</p>
<p>Dr. Hart considers China the West&rsquo;s only real civilizational rival. It produced many important innovations: paper, movable type, gunpowder, cast iron, the compass, and the use of coal as a fuel. Dr. Hart writes that the invention of paper in 105 AD gave the Chinese a head start that lasted for centuries because they had a monopoly on the best medium for storing knowledge. Under the Tang dynasty (618-907), he writes, China was clearly more advanced than any other place on earth. Marco Polo&rsquo;s 13th century accounts of the court of Kubilai Khan frankly acknowledged its superiority over anything in the West.</p>
<p>Kubilai, grandson of Genghis, ruled the largest empire the world has ever seen. It broke up shortly after his death, but by the 17th century, Mongol-derived people controlled even more territory than Kubilai had, including the Ottoman empire, Manchu China, and Mughal India (Mughal is the Persian word for Mongol). The Mughals and Ottomans were largely absorbed by the peoples they ruled, but their dominance was undisputed. Dr. Hart argues that the Mongol conquests required a high average intelligence bred in the harsh plains of north Asia. Like the Indo-Europeans of more than 5,000 years earlier, they were a hugely dynamic people that left its mark on vast regions to the south.</p>
<p>Another group Dr. Hart recognizes for remarkable but narrow accomplishment is the Polynesians who settled the Pacific islands, sometimes after voyages of thousands of miles. Not even the Phoenicians or Vikings rivaled their exploits. Dr. Hart points out that Pacific islands were without domesticable plants or animals, which means pioneers brought them. These were therefore deliberate voyages of colonization; distant islands were not accidentally populated by sailors blown off course.</p>
<p>There are also human populations distinguished by how little they have contributed. Reports of pre-contact sub-Saharan Africans are consistent: No tribe in that vast area had the wheel, writing, a calendar, or a mechanical device of any kind. Metal working had been introduced from the north, but in all of black Africa there were no two-story buildings and no monuments to compare even with the stone statues of Easter Island. Dr. Hart notes that Madagascar is 250 miles off the African coast, but Africans never settled it. Instead, it was populated from 3,000 miles away by Southeast Asians who arrived around 500 AD. Africans continue to be largely incapable of absorbing the science and technology of others, and have not added to it.</p>
<p>Australian aborigines were even more primitive than Africans when whites first found them. They were living in the old stone age, which is to say they did not work metal and had no domesticated crops. They had invented one thing: the boomerang, which they used as a weapon. The Tasmanians were more primitive still. About 10,000 years ago, when sea levels were lower, Tasmania was connected to Australia. When the ocean rose, the Tasmanians were unable to cross the Bass Strait. During their 10,000 years of separation, they became even more primitive than before: They forgot how to make sewing needles and fishhooks.</p>
<p><cite>Understanding Human History</cite> concludes with an unremarkable prediction: Races that have contributed the most will continue to do so, and vice versa. One could argue further, however, that unless whites give up certain illusions they will fall to permanent second-tier status behind the North Asians. For the last 50 years, whites have persisted in believing  &mdash;  or at least pretended to believe  &mdash;  that genes have nothing to do with a group&rsquo;s contributions to civilization. They have made dangerously dysgenic assumptions: that all immigrants are equally desirable, that dimwits should have as many children as geniuses, and that eugenics is immoral. North Asians, especially the Chinese, have no such illusions. As Dr. Hart points out, Western Man has had some very good innings. If he does not wake up from a foolish sentimentality, he will find that his days as a maker of history are over.<br>

		<p>It always amazes me how ignorant most whites are on this topic.  It is time to take our schools back and teach white kids about how great their ancestors were.  </p>
<p>The civilizations of the Americas were impressive in regards to their own standards but they contributed very little to the world knowledge bank.  Africa south of the Sahara, Oceania, most of Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Siberia, have contributed even less. </p>
<p>With a few exceptions, the Middle East and South Asia are backwards today.  These regions made impressive achievements at one time but still not as much as Europe has.  And it should be noted that white people have always lived in those areas as a minority group influencing progress to a certain degree. </p>
<p>China is the only civilization that rivals us.  However, I still refuse to believe that the Chinese have contributed as much to world civilization as we have.  Yes, they were advanced for longer periods than Europe was, but if you compare actual achievements between the two, Europe largely dominates, and there is no disputing that.</p>

		<p>Dr Hart&rsquo;s writing sounds fascinating. I&rsquo;ll have to add it to my collection. Speaking of the Indo-Europeans and influence, another good book is &#8220;The Horse, The Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World&#8221; by David W. Anothony. I&rsquo;ll bet your average punter does not know that horses were domesticated by White Europeans who are the likely candidates for invention of the wheel. </p>
<p>Along with the Greeks laying the foundation of Western Civ. in the 5th Century BC, it is also interesting that both Zarathurstra and Buddah-more Indo-European speakers-may have  also appeared during the same period, along with Confucius in China. </p>

		<p>I enjoyed this article.  The only thing that surprised me was the author&rsquo;s failure to credit India with inventing the alphabet and with advanced science long before anyone else was even close; India&rsquo;s Vedas are over 5,000 years old, and traders carried the alphabet to the Arabs and others over time.  India also had a remarkably advanced understanding of astronomy and biology; they knew 5,000 years ago that the earth and other planets revolved around the sun, and they were well aware of the existence of the atom.  These facts are not well-known today, probably because India is regarded as such a poor and backward country currently.  It was once the richest country in the world - remember that Columbus was searching for &#8220;the riches of the Indies&#8221; -i.e. India&hellip;  </p>

<p>And an extraordinary expansion it was!</p>
<p>For all our fancifully erratic self-induced problems, whites still remain the most powerful population on the planet. This is with, our global percentages reduced from around 38% in 1900 to about 12% today; and with, our entire civilization being: invaded and degraded from both without and within. </p>
<p>Often nonwhites (including Asians) speak of whites as &ldquo;being cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is that &ldquo;coldness,&rdquo; really a code word for original thought?</p>
<p>There is something to &ldquo;chillingly&rdquo; think about!</p>

<p>You bring up an interesting point, but I have to disagree.  India didn&rsquo;t do anything &#8220;advanced&#8221; with science until after the Greeks had made their advancements, and there is plenty of evidence that a lot of India&rsquo;s knowledge came from Greece. </p>
<p>And I find it hard to believe that their science was really so &#8220;advanced&#8221; considering that India was a backwards nation by the time the British arrived.  Marco Polo didn&rsquo;t even have much good to say about India.  And just because a country was rich in resources, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it was making advancements in science.  </p>
<p>I have read certain accounts of history (many of them written by biased Indians), that largely exaggerate what India actually did. I am sorry, but I just don&rsquo;t buy it.  If India already made all the advancements in modern science that some &#8220;historians&#8221; like to give it credit for, then how come nothing came of it?  Why was there no evidence for it by the time Marco Polo and then later the British, arrived?  </p>
<p>Just because they had already made great advancements in certain aspects of math and a couple of other fields, that by no way means that they already created modern science before Europeans did.  Maybe this isn&rsquo;t necessarily what you are saying, but this is what some misguided &#8220;historians&#8221; have hypothesized when there is simply not much evidence for it.</p>

		<p>Speaking of genetic decline and the end of Rome, we should STOP seeing the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 as the end of the Roman Empire tout court.</p>
<p>Since Costantine moved the capital to the East, Greece had been the true center of gravity of the Roman world. We should see the Germanic invasions of Italy as the loss of a province, not the end of the Empire.</p>
<p>In fact, after the fall of the West, the Costantinople-based Roman Empire quickly reconquered Rome and most of the Western Mediterranean, including most of Italy.<br>
A Roman in the sixth century would be extremely surprised if a time travaler from our age told him that the Roman empire in his age exists no more.</p>
<p>In fact, a Greek in the early 15th century would also be surprised to hear that the Roman Empire exists no more. The people of the so-called &#8220;Bizantine&#8221; empire called their own country simply the Roman Empire. There&rsquo;s a continuity between the ancient and the medieval Roman Empires. Both were Christian and based in Costantinople.</p>
<p>The end of the Empire&rsquo;s supremacy (not the end of the Empire itself!) came with the rise of Islam in the 7th century, which caused Christianity to lose control of the Mediterranean. If I understand things right, the ancient world was very dependant on naval trade routes and losing the seas caused its collapse.</p>
<p>That led directly to the so-called Islamic Golden Age, which can be explained as follows: Islam conquered most of what was then the rich First World (Spain, Syria, Assyria, Persia, Egypt, Sicily), and attributed the achievements and sophistication of those regions to Islam while at the same time replacing Whites with Arabs thus causing those regions to decline.</p>
<p>So if one wonders, how did the ancient Mediterranean decline? What happened to the glories of the classical world? The answer is:Islam destroyed half and took the merit for the other half.</p>
<p>If genetic decline weakened the Empire, it was by making it vulnerable to Islamic conquest. But I&rsquo;m not so sure it&rsquo;s necessary to assume a genetic decline. We know what made the Islamic conquest possible - Rome and Persia fought each other to exhaustion, without taking into account the possibility that a motivated third party showed up.</p>
<p>Of course, one might say that I, being Italian, am biased and don&rsquo;t want to hear that I&rsquo;m not the true descendant of the Romans. Maybe. But I&rsquo;m not denying that the genetic makeup of Italy changed (in many ways - there were migrations from all sides). I just don&rsquo;t see the fall of Rome as a mystery to be explained. No need to look for explanations other than that Islam attacked the Mediterranean world from &#8220;behind&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Interesting review of what certainly sounds like an interesting and provocative book, sufficiently provocative that ordering it will probably get the hopeful reader on a suspected terror list.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s disheartening is that the author has to lay out in painstaking detail what any observer pretty much knows to be true.</p>
<p>To wit, there of course are racial differences in intelligence, just as there are differences in physiology, facial characteristics, color, and average size.  Certainly, nobody would deny that such differences exist within the canine species, or within any species capable of interbreeding.</p>
<p>While nobody would stand your average-size Japanese next to a typical Caucasian or black-African American and claim that the size differential was an optical illusion, many will almost hysterically deny that any intellectual differences are real, or least that that they are inherent.</p>
<p>The real tragedy of this madness is that it effectively denies people of black African descent the opportunity to live fruitful and productive lives.  Black Africans can be skilled tradesmen (of whom there currently is no great surplus in America), artists, simple laborers, truckers, even scientists and doctors, damn good newspaper columnists, etc. There are black Africans at the highest levels of intelligence in this country right now, as exemplified by men like Dr. Thomas Sowell, in my judgment the most learned economist and social commentator in America, and Dr. Walter Williams, a close second to Sowell.</p>
<p>The current madness of insisting that all black failure to achieve parity with whites in all fields of endeavor would be as idiotic as insisting that the Manhattan Project was controlled by an evil cabal of Jews, who conspired to ensure that a totally disproportionate number of Jews were assigned to the project in a clear manifestation of Hitler&rsquo;s wildest fantasies of a vast international Jewish conspiracies.</p>
<p>Yes, there were a lot of Jewish scientists and physicists working within the Manhattan Project, not by virtue of some weird and inexplicable conspiracy, but because Jews are smart, intellectually focused, and abound in the hard sciences. </p>

<p>Sounds like the USA and the West today. As the saying goes, &#8220;a house divided cannot stand&#8221;, this is why Rome fell. It&rsquo;s empire expanded to include people who were not Roman, who didn&rsquo;t speak the language or have the culture. The same thing will happen to in North America/Europe/Australia if it continues to fill up with all these different races, religions, cultures and languages. It will increasingly weaken and become balkanized and fall.</p>

I enjoyed this article. The only thing that surprised me was the author&rsquo;s failure to credit India with inventing the alphabet and with advanced science long before anyone else was even close; India&rsquo;s Vedas are over 5,000 years old, and traders carried the alphabet to the Arabs and others over time.</p>
<p>An good observation! Michael Hart has shown that he has excellent knowledge of Chinese and Middle-Eastern history. But he is extremely ignorant when it comes to Indian history, something that is common among most educated Americans.

<p>2)If the  people  of  European stock are  so  much  more  cognitively  creative  than  others  then  why  did the  African civilisations  of  Egypt and  Kush develop  writing, cities, architecture  in stone at  least  2,500  years  before  Europe?</p>
<p>3) If  the  Eurasian  climes  were  so  much  more  challenging  than  the  tropics  then weren&rsquo;t  the Neanderthals more  cognitively  advanced  than  the incoming  peoples from  the tropical  South?  After  all, the Neanderthals were  in frigid and  variable-climate  Eurasia and  Europe for  more  than  300,000  years.</p>

		<p>Mr. Hart&rsquo;s book is brilliant and I suggest that you buy it. You will get a much deeper understanding of history if you consider racial differences in mental abilities. In a sane society, universities would be teaching this in their history classes. <br>
Anyways, history apart, it just took observation of appearance and behaviour to convince me since I was a child that Northern-Central Europeans (and their descendants through out the world like White Americans) and North East Asians (and their descendants through out the world) were the most advanced and evolved sub-species of mankind. Similarly I realised by observation alone that in all probability blacks were the most primitive sub-species of humankind with the rest of the races being in between. It was later in life that I came across literature on studies done on racial difference including those done on IQ. I was not at all surprised that the cold climate evolved Whites and East Asians had the highest IQs as well as other desirable characteristics like delay gratification. My instincts were proven correct. What I want to know is why other people fall for this &lsquo;races are equal&rsquo; rubbish. Don&rsquo;t their instincts as well as experiences tell them that some races are more evolved than others?<br>

The footnotes in this book are a treasure trove of history, as well as of Hindu definitions and distinctions.  For example, p. 72, &#8220;The atomic structure of matter was well known to the ancient Hindus&hellip;Thought the modern &#8216;atomic theory&rsquo; is generally considered a newer advance of science, it was brilliantly expounded long ago by Kanada (meaning &#8216;atom eater&rsquo;)&hellip;.these treatises are from the B.C. era, and include (1) the movement of needles toward magnets, (2) the circulation of water in plants, (3) the solar fire as the cause of all other formes of heat, (4) heat as the cause of molecular change (6) the law of gravitation as caused by the quality that inheres in earth-atoms to give them the attractive power or downward pull&hellip;.(9) the radiation of heat and light rays, invinitely small particles, darting forth in all directions with inconceivable speed, and (10) the relativity of time and space&hellip;.&#8221;  There is a lot more here in this quote alone, but this is enough to show that India (and the Indians are Caucasian, just as an aside) was WAY ahead of the Westerners, having profound scientic knowledge in the B.C. era.  The West didn&rsquo;t get to this until well into the A.D. era.</p>

<p>This right here is a fine example of Indians having a warped image of their own history.  This Indian poster goes down a list of areas that Indians have supposedly made huge advancements in recently (nuclear technology, computer programming, software development, rocket technology, and the Indian Space Program ).  </p>
<p>I guess he has me lost.  How come to this day, most Nobel Prize winners are either white or Japanese?  Where are all the Indian ones?  Yet this guy here would like us to believe that anything of value is mostly coming out of India today. </p>
<p> I even read a recent article that talked about how most scientific papers come out of America and Europe, with China close behind.  Meanwhile India has a long ways to go.  This sounds to me like India may be doing good work replicating in all these areas but it isn&rsquo;t making any original discoveries or inventing anything yet.</p>
<p>He mentions India&rsquo;s space program.   What has the Indian space program accomplished that a white country hasn&rsquo;t already accomplished?  Same with nuclear technology and everything else on his list.</p>
<p>Then he goes into history and brings up the usual morphed history that only Indians seem to be aware of, that falsely states that India was an advanced kingdom of knowledge that even the Greeks were jealous of.  Hmmmm.  I guess I have somehow missed this in all the history books I have read.  This is a fine example of Indians believing in false histories that aren&rsquo;t even true.  </p>
<p>I have never read anything about Alexander the Great being impressed by anything in India that had anything to do with science.  Just because he was impressed with other things about your country (culture, the size of cities etc&hellip;) that doesn&rsquo;t mean he was impressed with scientific achievements by any means. In all the history books that talk about the Ancient Greeks I have never read anything about the Greeks getting knowledge from India. </p>
<p>In response to OCCAM, you are bringing up stuff that has already been answered.  Micheal Hart and many others have thoroughly explained the answers to your questions already.  </p>
<p>Just because Europeans became civilized later than Middle Easterners, that by no way means they were less intelligent.  It should be obvious to anybody that Europe for the longest time was covered in ice and didn&rsquo;t have the advantages of having natural resources and lush river valleys to form cities in as the Chinese, Indians, and Middle Easterners did.</p>
<p>Liberals like you always throw out this argument about Europeans coming onto the scene late, but yet it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.  It is one of the most ignorant arguments I have ever heard.  </p>
<p>To make that argument and to use it as evidence that Europeans are less intelligent than everyone else, is flat out irrational, because you are purposely ignoring the fact that much later, Europe surpassed the rest of the world in achievements.</p>
<p>Legal Ph.D., you are proving my argument further. You are going by one source that was written by an Indian. </p>
<p> I agree that Indians did some remarkable things but you have to be careful with a lot of the books that were written by Indians.  Saying they made certain advancements in Astronomy etc&hellip;.is one thing.  Taking everything that has traditionally been well established as being invented and discovered by Europeans and trying to say the Indians did it thousands of years sooner is another thing. </p>
<p> I find it odd how Charles Murray in his very well researched book called &#8220;Human Accomplishment&#8221; and many other notable historians who aren&rsquo;t biased, somehow missed in their writings all these remarkable things that India did before modern Europe did them.  </p>
<p>Please explain why India was as backwards as it was when Marco Polo went there, even.  He may have been impressed with its riches but for some reason he said absolutely nothing about science that Europe didn&rsquo;t already have. </p>

<p>I have one question, which of these fields that you mention above was invented by Indians; or for that matter, improved upon/advanced as the Japanese have done with existing Western originations? For the most part, India has produced little in all of its past history and nothing (other than &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo;) in its &ldquo;modern&rdquo; history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, the Neanderthals were in frigid and variable-climate Eurasia and Europe for more than 300,000 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prehistory is difficult to evaluate, always. They still are not really sure why the dinosaurs went extinct, or for that matter even if they did. Good examples are the theory that the land dwellers evolved into birds and the existence of creatures thought to be &ldquo;extinct&rdquo; and still living in the oceans.</p>

<p>Thus OCCAM, how many more questions might arise from the Eurasian conundrum that you are asking here, when applied to humans and the development of the various races. </p>
<p>The answer is, endless&hellip;</p>
<p>What one must do, is look at the last 400 years and note where the world has advanced through European based development and where it is going, based on the Marxist-multicultural construct that has replaced it for the last 50 years of that timeframe.</p>

		<p>11 Occam: 1) 50,000 years ago there were no Europeans.  It is those tens of thousands of years of evolution that has made us distinct from other races.  <br>
     2)  I don&rsquo;t claim to know anything about Kush, but you clearly don&rsquo;t know anything about Ancient Egypt.  They were not Black.  <br>
     3) Neanderthals were bigger, hairier, and better adapted physically to cold climates than Homo Sapiens.  They had bigger brains too.  But they apparently did not have speech, which allowed the physically weaker Home Sapiens from Africa to work together more effectively and replace them.  These invaders from Africa, over tens of thousands of years, moved further into Neanderthal territory, evolving to better fit the lands they were occupying.  They became lighter skinned and more intelligent, while those Homo Sapiens that remained in Africa had no need to evolve further.  Like sharks and cockroaches, Africans were so well suited to their environment that further evolutionary change was unnecessary.  They were a whole lot smarter than lions and elephants and gorillas, and that was sufficient.  Not until they came into contact with peoples who had been evolving independently for tens of millennia did the Africans&rsquo; mental inferiority matter.  The desire of Blacks to mate with Whites is, among other things, an attempt to catch up with those peoples who left the Dark Continent so long ago.  </p>

actually I have read Paramhansa Yogananda. Most of his claims are a little, well, soma-inspired. Hindsight is always 20/20, and when you go through a vast literature with a fine comb, you are bound to find something (the &#8220;20 monkeys on typewriters&#8221; problem - no offense intended). The greatest contribution of India to Western science was the mathematical concept of zero (no, I´m serious:).<br>
The caste system, though racial stratification, ossified and hindered progress. So yes, an argument could be made FOR diversity. But in all probability, all that knowledge would have been lost through miscegenation.</p>
<p>- As for Egypt, the chalcolithic/megalithic development in Europe (though still incompletely understood) clearly predated AND influenced it - one trade zone, if not one culture along the coasts of Western Europe - and it originated in the north.<br>
In Egyptian mythology, Thot, the ibis-headed god who brought them writing, math and architecture (also called &#8220;apteka&#8221; i.e. &#8220;the navigator&#8221;) came from the west.</p>

As far as Indian contribution to mankind is concerned, I think they were a bit like the Meso-Americans. The ancient Indians were advanced in many theoretical fields like astronomy, mathematics etc&hellip; but were quite primitive in practical inventions in which China-Japan-Korea and Europe had always had superiority over them. Babar the Mughal (Mongol) conqueror of India found India a land full of super-rich Kings but extremely poor commoners. He found that Indians had not even invented something simple as the candle! European ships which came to India were far superior to the ships in the Maratha, Bengal or Mughal navies. In the battle of Diu, the combined forces of the Zamorin of Calicut, Sultan of Diu and the Turks lost to a tiny Portuguese fleet because the Portuguese had far superior technology on board their ships and they were better in strategy too.  <br>
Thus I believe Indians were strong on the theoretical knowledge but were weaker on practical innovations.</p>
<p>OCCAM<br>
Egypt is African but not black. African does not compulsorily means black, there were non-blacks living in North Africa from ancient times. Indeed Ancient Middle Eastern civilizations were the products of whites, and as these people started becoming brown, their civilizations declined and eventually collapsed.  For instance, in a comparison of skulls from ancient Egypt with modern human skulls, these skulls clustered with Europeans prior to joining the North African cluster. Read this scientific paper: Clines and clusters versus Race: a test in ancient Egypt and the case of a death on the Nile. CL Brace, DP Tracer, LA Yaroch, J Robb, K Brandt, Nelson A. R.

		<p>Um. Wow. We have some amazing misunderstandings here.<br>
First, lets look at the book. He argues that coldness spurs intelligence? Perhaps. But more important, he has missed a lot of the current research on early humans, namely Old European Studies. Look it up on Google. There has been an amazing amount of archaeological research within the former Soviet republics that show an incredible amount of development. The Early Europans smelted metal before the Indo-Europeans! They had two-story apartments that were very similar to our own, with a den, bedrooms, study, workshop, fireplace, etc.<br>
Second, the racism here placed on the noble Indian people is a bit misdirected. If any poster here knew this history, they would be aware that the &#8220;Aryans&#8221; conquered the north of India, subjugating the dark, southern Dravidians. &#8220;Whites&#8221; are the inventors and inheritors of the Hindu religion, and they continually fight against the Arabic Muslim hordes who continually wage war against them. Sound familiar, anyone?<br>
Third, and a final note, the art critic Thomas McEvilley has written extensively on the trade routes from Greece to India, and the subsequent intellectual and artistic trade. His argument is that early on the Greeks were influenced by the Indians, but later the Indians were influenced by the Greeks/Romans. This is all borne out not only in art, but also in philosophy. Note Pythagoras and Plato, which then moves to the radical eclecticism of Hellenism and mystical Neo-Platonism.</p>
<p>To review:<br>
1) Research Old European Studies. They were more advanced than Indo-Europeans.<br>
2) Stop hating Indians. They&rsquo;re ARYANS!<br>
3) The history of Greek philosophy is deeply indebted to Indian philosophy in its early years, after which the Greeks came into their own.<br>
4) Shut up if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Sigh. I rest my case. <br>

		<p>One must also keep in mind that many non-European civilizations were built by people of Caucasian stock.  It has already been mentioned that the ancient Egyptians were not black, but reality goes farther than that.  The leaders of that society were European (Cleopatra having Greek ancestry, i.e.); in fact, all the sophisticated societies of North Africa were built by people from the north.  And most of the intellectuals of Arab nations today are light-skinned.  <br>
Didn&rsquo;t the South Americans themselves say that white men had come and civilized them?  That&rsquo;s certainly a real possibility.  And, as for northern Asians having the highest IQ&rsquo;s, check out the findings of an EU study.  The former is high, certainly, but several European nations beat them.</p>

		<p>You would be amazed to know that African Americans have built this country and all great civilizations before it. White racism and all this hate is what holds us down now. If you stopped all this hating we could help move you forward and that would have a positive impact on YOUR childrens future.</p>
<p>But NO, you just have to hurt yourselfs just to hurt us worse. </p>
<p>THAT IS JUST SICK!!!</p>

		<p>@ Professor of Religious Studies (24):</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop hating Indians. They&rsquo;re ARYANS!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some are. Not all of them.</p>
<p>The Aryans created the caste system that still exists in India (although it&rsquo;s no longer official). And when one goes to India, nowadays, one will notice that the members of the higher castes, have whiter skin, and are generally taller, than the people who belong to the lower castes.</p>
<p>So of course, Indian culture is Aryan, but not all Indians are Aryans.</p>

		<p>India did produce ancient civilizations and probably ranks top 3 in terms of ANY civilization for scientific, mathematic, literary, medical, technological, etc. contributions to mankind.</p>
<p>But this is TOTALLY concurrent with the observed facts: MOst of India&rsquo;s population consists of Indo-Aryans who speak Sanskritic derived languages (Hindi, Gujurati, Bengali, etc.), which are Indo-European languages and related to the languages of Europe (Russian, German, Swedish, Italian, English, Greek, Serbian, etc.).  Virtually all of North India&rsquo;s population consists of these European/Caucusus-descended Indo Aryans, with the exception of the Dalits (&#8216;Untouchable&rsquo; Caste Hindus) and Tribal people (who are similar to Australian aborigines).</p>

That Black people created mathematics? I believe he istrying to pass off the same outmoded stereotypical lies from the past! Blacks didnt settle Madagasacr? perhaps it wasnt worth their time!

<p>If the cause of black plight is white wickedness, then the solution is simple. Whites should pack their bags and leave black people alone so they can rise up and reach their full potential unrestrained by racism.<br>

Why is it that every time white people pack their bags and leave blacks to their own devices the whole place goes down to hell:<br>

		<p>The only so-called pure &#8216;Aryans&rsquo; in India are the native Kashmiris. But they are certainly not among the brightest in India.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged even within India that the south-Indian brahmins are the smartest, even more than north Indians.</p>
<p>The tribes of Afghanistan (such as the Pashtuns) certainly have sharper features and could be considered more &#8216;Aryan&rsquo; than most Indians, but again, they still live primitive lifestyles and probably not too intelligent on an individual basis as well.</p>
<p>Maybe Islam has a dumbing down effect on populations over a period of several generations.<br>

		<p>Some may say that White Racism is responsible for keeping the black man down.. and that black people built all the higher civilizations&hellip; This is hard for me to believe from any thing I&rsquo;ve observed. However&hellip; If I were black and believed this I would feel it were my duty to my racial kin and myself to harmonize this very realization amongst the black family. In this way the black family can turn unto itself, recollect its true nature of excellence and reproduce new examples of the black genius in being the original creators of high culture. I don&rsquo;t see how whites can prevent blacks from demonstating their innate excellence everywhere?.. One place to start would be the subsaharan areas of Africa. It has long been said ..&#8221;you can&rsquo;t keep a good man down&#8221;  Go for it* Along with this If I were black and thus believed the white man is responsible for all the black mans woo&rsquo;s&hellip; I certainly would discourage my fellow black men to refrain from stepping all over their own black women to get a &#8220;Trophy&#8221; white women&hellip; A bright light cannot be denied&hellip;.Go for it*</p>

		<p>Hart speaks of the &#8220;winnowing effect&#8221; of a cold climate. But living in a semi-desert like India, with only the monsoon rains for growing food is no picnic either. India is a NOT a lush green country where you can survive by picking fruit off trees. If the monsoons fail, as they do every 30-50 years, mass famine ensues. Only those smart enough to plan for planting before the rainy season, and save for the inevitable famine survive. A &#8220;winnowing&#8221; effect wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>

		<p>Italian #7 brings up a good point&hellip;..<i>We know what made the Islamic conquest possible - Rome and Persia fought each other to exhaustion, without taking into account the possibility that a motivated third party showed up.</i></p>
<p>Although Italian suggests this to be a commonly known historical fact, I dont believe it is.  So allow me to elaborate&hellip;.</p>
<p>Ever since the collapse of the Western Empire the Eastern Empire and the Sasanian Persians had been in a virtually continual state of war with first one, then the other side, having the advantage, until..(the following copied from this source </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire#Second_Golden_Era_.28498.E2.80.93622.29)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire#Second_Golden_Era_.28498.E2.80.93622.29)</a></p>
<p>The Persians overran Syria and captured Antioch in 611.   In 613, outside Antioch, the Persian generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin decisively defeated a major counter-attack led in person by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius. Thereafter the Persian advance continued unchecked. Jerusalem fell in 614, Alexandria in 619 and the rest of Egypt by 621. </p>
<p>The Sassanid dream of restoring the Achaemenid boundaries was close to completion. This remarkable peak of expansion was paralleled by a blossoming of Persian art, music, and architecture. The Byzantine Empire was on the verge of collapse and the borders of the Achaemenid Empire came close to being restored on all fronts.</p>
<p>While originally seeming successful at a first glance, the campaign of Khosrau II had actually exhausted the Persian army and Persian treasuries. In an effort to rebuild the national treasuries, Khosrau overtaxed the population. Thus, seeing the opportunity, Heraclius (610–641) drew on all his diminished and devastated empire&rsquo;s remaining resources, reorganized his armies and mounted a remarkable counter-offensive. </p>
<p>Between 622 and 627 he campaigned against the Persians in Anatolia and the Caucasus, winning a string of victories against Persian forces under Khosrau, Shahrbaraz, Shahin and Shahraplakan, sacking the great Zoroastrian temple at Ganzak and securing assistance from the Khazars and Western Turkic Khaganate.  </p>
<p>In 626, Constantinople was besieged by Slavic and Avar forces which were supported by a Persian army under Shahrbaraz on the far side of the Bosphorus, but attempts to ferry the Persians across were blocked by the Byzantine fleet and the siege ended in failure. In 627-8 Heraclius mounted a winter invasion of Mesopotamia and, despite the departure of his Khazar allies, defeated a Persian army commanded by Rhahzadh in the Battle of Nineveh. He then marched down the Tigris, devastating the country and sacking Khosrau&rsquo;s palace of Dastagerd. (end of copied passage)</p>
<p>Just when both sides were devastated and exhausted the Arabs suddenly appeared on the scene with their new religion.   Within a few years Persia was completely over-run whilst the Byzantines quickly surrendered N.Africa and the Levant and retreated to successfully defend the Anatolian heartland of their empire.  <br>
 <br>
Had Khosrau´s Persian conquest of the East and subsequent Roman reconquest never occurred it seems hard to believe that the Arabs would have had the strength to conquer North Africa and the Levant.   Byzantine/Persia´s self-administered mutually fatal wounds opened a lucky window of opportunity for Islam, without which it would have been stillborn – disappearing without trace or historical record into the sands of Arabia.  </p>
<p>Hands up who knew this?  Just as I thought..!</p>

		<p>Speaking of the Indo-Europeans and influence, another good book is &ldquo;The Horse, The Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World&rdquo; by David W. Anothony.   &mdash;  -  Dutchman<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The domesticated horse, then development of the wheel (the chariot), was equivalent to the atom bomb of its age.  It made the Indo-Aryan tribes a &#8220;super power&#8221;, so to speak,  and made their vast conquests possible.  Excepting  some remote mountain tribes, high in the Pyrenees and Caucasus,  they were irresistible   &mdash;    which is why we nearly all speak common Indo-Aryan tongues today, from Scotland  <i>(Scots Gaelic) </i> to Ceylon <i>(Singhalese).  </i></p>

<p>Are you sure you meant it that way?  Or did you mean to say white brains and black cooperation?  (We could sure use some cooperation.)  Seems more likely.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the anecdote regarding  G.B.Shaw and the famous actress. She quipped, &#8220;Mr. Shaw,  Just imagine if you and I had a child. With your brains and my beauty, what a superb specimen it would be!&#8221;   Shaw  (never at a loss for words) replied,  &#8220;But madam, what if the poor child got your brains and my beauty?&#8221;</p>
<p>And btw, Mr. Manba,  the correct spelling of the snake is &#8220;black mamba&#8221;, one of the most poisonous,  evil,  vicious, unpredictable, and dangerous of serpents.   Not one we&rsquo;d care to associate with or make deals with.  Thanks anyway.</p>

		<p>Some remarks on the comments posted above:</p>
<p><br>
<i>However, I still refuse to believe that the Chinese have contributed as much to world civilization as we have. Yes, they <br>
were advanced for longer periods than Europe was, but if you compare actual achievements between the two, Europe largely dominates, and there is no disputing that.</i></p>
<p>Advancements and cumulative contributions are always relative in time. The Chinese could have said the same thing in 1100 AD and might as well do so again in 2100, given their current growth. From the information present in some 7000 years of recorded history, civilizations around the world have risen and fallen each making their respective contributions in their zenith. Every civilization has had to stand on their predecessors&rsquo; shoulders to acquire the available knowledge and extend it. </p>
<p><br>
<i>You bring up an interesting point, but I have to disagree. India didn&rsquo;t do anything &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; with science until after the Greeks had made their advancements, and there is plenty of evidence that a lot of India&rsquo;s knowledge came from Greece.</i></p>
<p>As I noted above, advancements are relative in time. A lot of Hindu philosophical literature predates Greece. </p>
<p><br>
<i>And I find it hard to believe that their science was really so &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; considering that India was a backwards nation by the time the British arrived. Marco Polo didn&rsquo;t even have much good to say about India. And just because a country was rich in resources, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it was making advancements in science.</i></p>
<p>By the time Marco Polo traveled there, the Hindu empires were well past their peak; and besides, much of what we know about Indian contributions was discovered much later in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prof. Angus Maddison has made some estimations of historical GDP of various regions. Look for &#8216;Appendix B: World Population and GDP before 1820&rsquo; on his website here: <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/</a> </p>
<p><br>
<i>It should be obvious to anybody that Europe for the longest time was covered in ice and didn&rsquo;t have the advantages of having natural resources and lush river valleys to form cities in as the Chinese, Indians, and Middle Easterners did.</i></p>
<p>Civilizations did not begin anywhere until well after the the last ice age ended some 8000 years ago. Europe is much more lush green than the bulk of North Africa, Middle East, South and Central Asia. Just look at the satellite picture here: http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s292/Deigo2006/earth_map.jpg. While cold weather might have been a disadvantage to Europeans, keep in mind that the bulk of China and Central Asia are cold as well. North Africa and Middle East are absolute deserts, and the bulk of South Asia is arid; and all these regions are extremely hot, with temperatures reaching above 50 C in the summer. </p>
<p><br>
<i>I find it odd how Charles Murray in his very well researched book called &ldquo;Human Accomplishment&rdquo; and many other notable historians who aren&rsquo;t biased, somehow missed in their writings all these remarkable things that India did before modern Europe did them.</i></p>
<p>No history book is comprehensive and every historian has some kind of bias. Besides, the recording of history is an ongoing process and if new evidence is found of existence of knowledge of some scientific concept in a place not originally attributed for that concept, history has to be annotated. Just because a particular book does not mention a discovery, it does not mean it is untrue. For example, Mathematical concepts in number theory such as the Fibonacci series were later discovered in Indian texts predating Fibonacci by almost 7 centuries.</p>
<p><br>
<i>How come to this day, most Nobel Prize winners are either white or Japanese? Where are all the Indian ones?</i></p>
<p>The list of Nobel Prizes by country of origin are here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country:<br>
For Asian nations: India 7, China 9, Japan 16, Pakistan 1</p>
<p><br>
<i>14 Legal PhD: Maybe you should stick to law, and not the history of science. So some Hindu swaami wrote a book 50 years ago that claims that over 2000 years ago, Indians had made all these discoveries that Europeans imagined were original to themselves. If so, where were the steam engines and electric lights and all the other technologies that the West developed once the scientific principles were understood?</i></p>
<p>Civilizations fall. There is no such rule that a founder of a concept/idea has to be solely responsible for all subsequent ideas built upon it. Similar questions could be asked for Egypt, Greece and China, i.e, why they did not create the modern world? A lot of knowledge that set the foundations for exploration and modern science has its roots outside Europe, e.g, Gunpowder/Paper/Compass (China), Decimal positional place value system/Formal Grammar (India), Algorithms (Middle East). If you have to stand on the shoulders of others in order to make your contributions, there is no respect lost in crediting them.</p>
<p><br>
<i>#10 DeepakNPatel &hellip;<br>
actually I have read Paramhansa Yogananda. Most of his claims are a little, well, soma-inspired. Hindsight is always 20/20, and when you go through a vast literature with a fine comb, you are bound to find something (the &ldquo;20 monkeys on typewriters&rdquo; problem - no offense intended).</i></p>
<p>I agree that most ancient philosophical postulates on the nature of matter were speculative, but that holds true for European literature as well. </p>
<p><br>
<i>We invented Kama Sutra, which is ALWAYS FASCINATING TO NON-INDIANS. this is of our life and pleasure giving superiority. ponder this as needed but it is truth!</i></p>
<p>Very true, I almost forgot it. Indians taught us what to do with our women and how! :). Might as well mention Yoga and Meditation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly, I thought I should mention this since this website is all about &#8216;racial purity&rsquo; and the article talks about achievements of various races/cultures: The bulk of important scientific achievements in the 20th century have been made not by &#8216;pure white&rsquo; people but by members of the ethnic Jewish diaspora. Simply look at the names of Nobel laureates. I find it odd that white nationalists like to rail about the Jews but have no problem appropriating Jewish accomplishments as their own.</p>
