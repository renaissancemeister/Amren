			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward A. Adams, ABA Journal, February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A judge&rsquo;s race or gender makes for a dramatic difference in the outcome of cases they hear  &mdash;  at least for cases in which race and gender allegedly play a role in the conduct of the parties, according to two recent studies.</p>
<p>The results were the focus of a program about &#8220;Diversity on the Bench: Is the &#8216;Wise Latina&rsquo; a Myth?,&#8221; sponsored by the ABA Judicial Division at the ABA Midyear Meeting in Orlando on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>In federal racial harassment cases, one study found that plaintiffs lost just 54 percent of the time when the judge handling the case was an African-American. Yet plaintiffs lost 81 percent of the time when the judge was Hispanic, 79 percent when the judge was white, and 67 percent of the time when the judge was Asian American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A second study, looked at 556 federal appellate cases involving allegations of sexual harassment or sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The finding: plaintiffs were at least twice as likely to win if a female judge was on the appellate panel.</p>
<p>University of Pittsburgh School of Law Professor Pat K. Chew, who co-authored the racial harassment study, said she found &#8220;the rule of law is intact&#8221; in the cases she reviewed. Judges  &mdash;  no matter which side they ruled for  &mdash;  took the same procedural steps to reach their decisions, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pressed on whether the rule of law could actually be considered intact when outcomes varied so much depending on the race of the judge, she replied: &#8220;It&rsquo;s always made a difference who the judge was. We&rsquo;ve long known, for instance, that a judge&rsquo;s political affiliation makes a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Carol E. Jackson of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri said she was heartened that diversity has crept into the federal court system, where today 20 percent of judges are women and 15 percent are members of minority groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important that different voices are being heard,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose these findings are surprising. If you are both Black and female, you are simultaneously part of two groups constantly on the warpath over alleged discrimination/harassment. Naturally, that would influence the judge&rsquo;s initial inner reaction to claims of discrimination or harassment, which judging from the article, has greater influence on the ruling than any of the procedures followed by the judge.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s this?  I thought <i>all</i> judges were black women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I saw on TV, anyway.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has noticed, but all those &#8220;judge&#8221; shows on TV like Judy Judy, Divorce court, etc.  None of the judges are white (except for I think one a few years ago).  They are all black, latino (light skinned) and Jewish.  The way they judge is very brash, self-righteous, reeking of favoritism to like groups and activist in nature.  All of those personalities were real judges before getting their own TV shows.  This shows me what courts have become in real life.</p>

		<p>Notice how the study doesn&rsquo;t mention the race of the plaintiff?</p>
<p>I bet that, if you controlled for both the race of the judge and the race of the plaintiff, you would find that almost all cases of this type were won when both the judge and the plaintiff were black.</p>
<p>In other words, black judges are incredibly racist.  The facts don&rsquo;t matter.  Only the race of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>This is a very dangerous situation, by the way.  Because our judiciary is so corrupt, there will come a time when the widespread, prevailing opinion is that they have no right, no moral authority to decide anything.  After that, the US will no longer be a nation with the rule of law.</p>

		<p>When you take a good look at the kind of people who go into law, and then the ways in which that group is winnowed to select judges, it becomes easy to lose confidence in our justice system. I don&rsquo;t think using affirmative action as part of the winnowing method has led to any improvements at all. </p>
