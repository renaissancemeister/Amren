<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8514736.stm">BNP Votes to Ditch Whites-Only Membership Rule</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party has voted to scrap its whites-only membership rules after an extraordinary general meeting.</p>
<p>Members who had gathered in Essex voted to amend the party&rsquo;s constitution to let black and Asian people join.</p>
<p>The BNP had been threatened with a possible court injunction over its whites-only membership policy by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>The party must now go back to court in March when a judge will decide if the new rules meet race relation laws.</p>
<p>It is thought the BNP has removed references to &#8220;indigenous British&#8221; people, paving the way for black and Asian people to be admitted to the party for the first time.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Legal reality&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>But a BNP spokesman said he could not comment on the precise wording of the new rules until they had been seen by Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) lawyers.</p>
<p>Anti-fascist group Searchlight said the membership rule change was &#8220;a meaningless gesture&#8221;, adding that &#8220;no-one seriously believes that thousands of black and Asian Britons will now be queuing up to join Nick Griffin&rsquo;s party&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group said: &#8220;The BNP are as racist and extremist as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>BNP leader Nick Griffin told the BBC News Channel: &#8220;We had to do it (change the constitution) for legal reasons. Many of our members think it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>In the short term this dispute is costing the BNP money. The party has incurred legal fees, and it is barred from taking on new members until this is resolved.</p>
<p>If the BNP loses at the next court hearing it faces the possibility of an injunction forcing it to look again at its constitution.</p>
<p>Ignoring that could result in court sanctions. However this is a civil, not criminal, case and the EHRC cannot punish the party itself.</p>
<p>It certainly does not have the power to stop the BNP from contesting the general election.</p>
<p>Nick Griffin has tried to rally his members behind this fight with the EHRC. But he knows as the election approaches he will have to spend more time with his party&rsquo;s lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people said we should have done it some time ago but that&rsquo;s really by the by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our problem with this is a government funded, taxpayer-funded quango telling people who they can and can&rsquo;t associate with, [which] is a fundamental outrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, we recognise legal reality, so we have done it and now, for one thing, they can&rsquo;t call us racist any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin also defended the forcible expulsion of a newspaper journalist from Sunday&rsquo;s meeting, saying the paper had previously written &#8220;lies&#8221; about the BNP.</p>
<p>The expulsion took place before the result of the vote was announced as Times journalist Dominic Kennedy was bundled out of the venue by BNP security guards.</p>
<p>Mr Kennedy said he had been invited to the meeting by party officials, but on arrival had been confronted by senior BNP member Richard Barnbrook, who is also a London Assembly member.</p>
<p>Mr Kennedy told the BBC News website &#8220;A number of BNP security people shoved me out of the room. I was hit in the back and had my nose grabbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had not been hurt in the incident.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Indigenous&rsquo; Britons</b></p>
<p>Asked on the BBC News channel how the BNP could expect to be seen as a normal political party in the light of its behaviour towards a journalist, Mr Griffin said Mr Kennedy had been ejected because of Times &#8220;lies&#8221; about his party.</p>
<p>&#8220;He refused to leave when he was asked so he had to be encouraged to leave,&#8221; said Mr Griffin.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We will carry on throwing The Times out until they report the truth. That&rsquo;s all we ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Griffin and his party must now wait until next month to learn whether the changes to its rules will enable it to escape a court injunction.</p>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) had threatened the injunction against the BNP unless it changed rules limiting membership to &#8220;indigenous British&#8221; people.</p>
<p>However at a Central London County Court hearing last month, there were questions over whether amendments proposed to the party&rsquo;s constitution would go far enough to satisfy lawyers from the EHRC.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Major obstacle&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>On Sunday, the EHCR said it had not seen the changes to the party&rsquo;s membership rules but hoped that it was &#8220;no longer discriminatory&#8221;.</p>
<p>An EHCR spokeswoman said: &#8220;We&rsquo;re expecting to see a copy of the policy on Tuesday, which is the deadline set by the court.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&rsquo;ve received this we will consider our position ahead of the next court hearing on 9th March.&#8221;</p>
<p>BNP deputy leader Simon Darby said further changes had been made since the court hearing and the party now believed it had overcome the &#8220;major obstacle that has stopped us from complying with the law&#8221;.</p>
<p>The section of the constitution that could viewed as discriminatory against potential ethnic minority members had been removed, he told BBC News.</p>
<p>But he said he could not comment on the precise wording until it had been seen by EHRC lawyers, which would happen within the next seven days.</p>
<p>He said Mr Griffin had the authority to make further minor changes to the wording if the EHRC was not satisfied.<br>

		<p>I commend Nick Griffin and the BNP for holding out as long as they did before making this decision. Had the BNP continued to hold out, the British government might have put them out of business. The BNP is the only electoral alternative available to White voters in the U.K.; their continued existence is vital.</p>
<p>It does represent the final step in the transition of the BNP from a racial nationalist party (exclusively White) to a racial populist party (majority White). But sometimes one must take a step backward now in order to take steps forward in the future.</p>
<p>Besides, before we Yanks get too judgmental, where&rsquo;s our BNP? It is only this year that two American pro-White parties, the American Third Position Party and the Nationalist Party of America, began organizing. But the BNP has been at it much longer, and has elected more than 100 officials, to include two MEPs. They remain worthy of our respect.</p>

		<p>The head of the EHRC is black.  Isn&rsquo;t it sad that a black man can tell the British people who they can and can not associate with?  That the British system of justice can not defend the rights of Englishmen, Scots, Welshmen, or the Irish?  That the Sovereign is allowed no say in what civil rights her subjects should have?  A Prime Minister who is so gutless that he can not come out and say &#8220;I may not agree with the BNP but they have a right to say what they want&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Trevor Phillips is no more than the Robert Mugabe of the UK.  Remember, a people usually lose their rights bit by bit.  Even Castro need a couple of years to get everything under his control.</p>

What they have to do is make sure their charter is specific to their goals. Anyone is then free to join but only if they&rsquo;re committed to abiding by the charter.</p>
<p>Make it clear that the charter is immutable and not open to debate or change.</p>
<p>Otherwise, thousands of non-whites could join and then seize control by changing the charter.</p>

		<p>So, my question to Nick Griffin would be &#8220;how are you now any different than the other political parties?&#8221;  How can you claim &#8220;Britains for Britain&#8221; if you allow a single non-White &#8220;Briton&#8221; to join?  This has nothing to do with &#8220;exclusion,&#8221; but everything to do with saving the very essence of what it means to be &#8216;British.&rsquo; Simply crossing an imaginary line on a map and settling in doesn&rsquo;t make you &#8216;British.&rsquo;  I can see now that, eventually, the BNP will be co-opted, corrupted, and fall into disarray, eventually becoming no different than the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Social Democrat, or Unionist parties.</p>

		<p>I am getting sick of this!  Why do we as whites put up with stuff like this????  These nonwhites who join the BNP are only going to act as puppets for the left so that the BNP can&rsquo;t function or get anything done.  I am sick of it!  Enough!</p>
<p>Great Britain is becoming a joke.  Did you see the little performance Great Britain put on at the end of the Beijing Olympics Closing Ceremony as a prelude to it hosting the Olympics in 2012?  China puts on a production celebrating Chinese history and culture.  All that Great Britain wants to do in response is portray itself as a global multiracial society. Here is the link if you dare to see it:</p>

		<p>To say something positive on this issue, I can think of a possible benefit.</p>
<p>The media is always calling the BNP racist. Well, if there were a few non-whites in the BNP who supported its ideaology and were basically tokens, the media and everyone else wouldn&rsquo;t be able to call their party racist. It would be intellectually dishonest and untrue to say otherwise.</p>
<p>Of course, the term &#8220;racist&#8221; has become a cliche and lost all its meaning, so it might not be as much of a benefit as I first thought. But to be realistic I don&rsquo;t think having a few non-whites in the BNP will change anything.</p>

		<p>The BNP needs to unofficially discriminate against non-natives. On the cover they must act as if they are a party open to both natives as well as non-natives to save them from the unfair laws of the country but they must internally discriminate against them. White people need to become sneakier if they are to win in their struggle in this multiracial hellhole. Morality and uprightness will not win you anything. This is what South Asian and Middle Eastern businesses do all the time. They interview everybody but give the job only to people of their own clans or of their own families.</p>

<p>Since when has the mainstream media ever been intellectually honest? (answer: not for a very long time)</p>
<p>As long as the BNP stick up for the indigenous Brits the establishment and the MSM will call them waysist, fascist, nartzees, bigots, xenophobes, knuckledraggers etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>The more a group claims to be anti-fascist or anti-racist, the more it it likely this group will be racist themselves, that is, the more racist they will be. Perhaps there is no other possible outcome in these Orwellian times? Almost any and all (above-ground and above board) act that claims to be fighting racism is almost certainly designed to be as racist as possible towards whites. The public is so &#8216;brainwashed&rsquo; by now people hardly even notice it. The term &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;, a racial slur, is boldy used as a sign of enlightenment and tolerance. </p>

		<p>Ah yes, the &#8216;Equality and Human Rights Commission&rsquo; (EHRC), this is a QUANGO, publicly funded, Unelected Non-Governmental Organisation, offspring of our scottish dominated, communist labour party, the present government. Note well the &#8216;unelected&rsquo; bit which also denotes &#8216;unaccountable&rsquo; and &#8216;unquestionable&rsquo;. The EHCR is headed by Trevor Phillips, a black man, who despises the White Christian English so much that his entire hand-picked tax-payer funded office is packed with those who are not White, Christian and English. They have unlimited government money with which to fund their legal team, mostly non-White, and harass the BNP and anyone else who they determine are racist or question the labour party on it&rsquo;s fetid immigration planning. Now compare this story (excellent juxtapositioning AMREN) with the one on the &#8216;secret&rsquo; immigration policy, which members of the BNP and millions of other Englishmen have known about for years. However, just to question the wisdom of unrestricted immigration would invoke a torrent of black and brown abuse and screams of &#8216;racism&rsquo; and the EHCR would be hurtling around sniffing out the evil white witches to burn at the celebrated multicult diversity stake. Note also that the EHCR are still unhappy even with the rule changes, claiming ethnic minorities would not want to join the BNP anyway. No doubt they are squatting in their offices figuring out a way to disqualify BNP voting papers at the forthcoming general election. They already have the post office workers, a lot from nigeria, refusing to deliver electoral material from the BNP as they feel it offends them. More like it takes time away from stealing cash from kids birthday cards as exposed on UK T/V recently.   </p>

<p>Eventually, the BNP will be all non-white because there will be no whites left. That&rsquo;s a long time coming. It wont hurt now to open up the BNP. These blatantly pro-black (much more pro-black etc than the BNP is pro-white) groups, like the labor party, allow whites to join and worship non-whites. It&rsquo;s not much different allowing Chinese people to join the BNP.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is that all non-whites are afforded this special &#8216;victim&rsquo; status, and if they don&rsquo;t feel that way school teachers and the media will certainly make them feel this way. Since the average non-white is so unintelligent&hellip; it&rsquo;s no surprise they accept this ideology before too long. And considering the seat of the ideology (and of course the well known non-white lack of intelligence - or creativity), it&rsquo;s no surprise that the most intelligent non-whites conform to this idea.</p>
<p>The way to gain rights and representation, seems therefore, for whites to somehow be made into victims too. Perhaps crime coverage can do it? At this point, when whites are &#8216;victims&rsquo; somehow in the media, I suspect the whole topsy-turvy world where &#8216;victims&rsquo; are the supreme moral authority, may be uprighted. After all, we will all be victims. Perhaps it will even be turned upside down. </p>
<p>Still there may be that brief moment, perhaps even a good year, where whites are &#8216;victims&rsquo;, and that term still means something. We should be prepared to milk it for all it&rsquo;s worth in the most effective way possible. Perhaps to kick them all out, or perhaps to establish some kind of final reserve in either Scotland or Wales.     </p>

		<p>Hello,<br>
when I hear something like that I always ask myself &#8220;Why do they surrender unconditionally?&#8221;</p>
<p>If I would be the boss of the BNP I would compile a list of all exclusive organizations (Searchlight is open only to antifascists, certain libraries arew open only to females and so on).<br>
And the I would rewrite the charter to:<br>
&#8220;The changes to the charter are valid for one year. If during this time the EHRC does not challenge the organizations mentioned in the list with the same time frame allowed to them as to the BNP, then the charter will be as it was before. Also all non white people who joined the BNP during this time will be automatically thrown out. If the EHRC challenges the other organizations successfully then the charter will be valid for another year. If the EHRC leaves even one exclusive organization alone than the charter will be reset to pre-change rules.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I disagree with our coming to terms with the word &#8220;racist&#8221; especially since it&rsquo;s being used on everyone else as well. </p>
<p>The inclusion of other races into the BNP makes sense however it will only be a matter of time before that political group becomes corrupted as well.  Too much outside influence destroys the purity of any group. The strength of our survival lays in individual behavior. Whites have to become almost an underground movement ready to sacrifice everything in order to advance ourselves. At the present, it seems that most are not ready to do that. But as circumstances become worse, I suspect it will reach a point where we will have no choice. Those who begin the fight will certainly be remembered as heroes. </p>

		<p>To all you pessimists out there I have to say this. BNP did NOT have any other choice but to allow non-whites to join. If they didn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;d be dragged through courts forever and go bankrupt. I bet that was the original plan of the multicult dictators. BNP stated on their website several times that they simply don&rsquo;t have any other choice. They need to play this insane game until they come to power and change the rules. I trust Griffin and I believe he made the right decision.</p>

		<p>With growing disgust and dismay, I watched the video link (kindly posted above) to the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and the London 2012 preview presentation.</p>
<p>The shamelessly multi-cultural indoctrination was fronted by a BLACK FEMALE DRUMMER sitting atop a &#8220;London Bus&#8221; surrounded by BLACK AFRICAN hip-hoppers and break-dancers with the occasional token whitey making an appearance but I´m sure hardly noticed by the head-shakingly bemused billion-strong Chinese TV audience.</p>
<p>How more Peecee can you get but to include a Rastafarian in a wheelchair, an &#8220;award-winning&#8221; black kid in another wheelchair, in fact lots of wheelchairs, and lots of blacks, but not many whites except in minor roles.  Even the actor playing &#8220;Nelsons Statue&#8221;, which came to life brandishing a guitar, looked somewhat &#8220;suspect&#8221;.  Sometimes its hard to tell the Brits from the Blacks and obviously this is the INTENTION.  </p>
<p>The toadying white presenter, looking for words to describe the exercise in hip-hopping multiculti mind-control, said &#8220;Lots of Power in There&#8221; - indeed, but its BLACK POWER!!</p>
<p>The toady finished by proudly proclaiming London 2012 to be &#8220;the most inclusive Olympics ever&#8221;&hellip;whatever that means.</p>
<p>I knew it was bad, but not this bad.  I´m speechless with rage..!<br>
This madness has got to end&hellip;SOON..!!!</p>

London 2012 will be &#8220;the most inclusive/diverse Olympics ever.&#8221;  They will also be the most expensive Olympics ever, the biggest deficit-causing and red ink-causing Olympics ever, and the most injurious to the civil liberties of current residents ever. (knowing how few civil liberties native born white Londoners have anymore).</p>
<p>The Daily Mail said this in passing in their article about how expensive, red-inkey and despotic the current games in Vancouver are:</p>

<p>The Sovereign is not interested in protecting the rights of her subjects. This particular monarch has violated practically every part of her coronation oath in much the same way as American politicians violate the constitution they formally swear to uphold.</p>
<p>Whatever value or legitimacy the British Crown once possessed it has now forfeited. One of the most sensible things the BNP could do once they assume power is to abolish the monarchy outright and convert the UK into an ethnic folk-state in which the people themselves are sovereign.</p>
<p>As for Gordon Brown: he isn&rsquo;t gutless, at least not in the way you allude to. He wants to abolish freedom of speech for those who disagree with him. You only need to peruse his biography to see why.</p>
<p>Although I regret the BNP having to make the decision it did, sometimes in order to obtain a strategic victory a tactical retreat must be made. I encourage everyone to hang in and see this through to the end. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be a bitter end if we all stand and fight.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Members who had gathered in Essex voted to amend the party&rsquo;s constitution to let black and Asian people join.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Black and Asian people do actually join, I honestly think those people will look totally ridiculous.</p>
