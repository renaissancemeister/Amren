			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal immigrant who murdered the daughter he had to avoid deportation was jailed for life today.</p>
<p>Olusola Akinrele, 34, was told he must serve at least 16 years in prison for killing six-week-old baby girl Leeya in December 2006.</p>
<p>Leeya died from brain damage 12 days after her apparently lifeless body was found at her home in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire. She had 22 broken ribs, a fractured skull, a fractured thigh, and had also been bitten on the nose and both hands, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
<p>Judge Philip Clegg said: &#8216;When she was not asleep, Leeya must have been in excruciating pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said Akinrele, a Nigerian, had &#8216;little or no interest in his daughter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;You simply saw her birth as something which might help you avoid deportation,&rsquo; he told the killer.</p>
<p>Akinrele was described in a psychiatric report as &#8216;a manipulative individual with psychopathic traits&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He was convicted of murder by a jury at Ipswich Crown Court and faces automatic deportation on completing his sentence.</p>
<p>The baby&rsquo;s mother Kelly Inman, 22, pleaded guilty earlier to allowing her death and was cleared of murder during the trial.</p>
<p>She received a total sentence of five years, having also been convicted of a separate fraud charge.</p>
<p>It was she who called 999 after Akinrele&rsquo;s final attack on their daughter.</p>
<p>Ipswich Crown Court heard that in the two-and-a-half weeks following her birth, Leeya underwent routine checks by midwives and a health visitor and her condition had not caused concern.</p>
<p>But in the 24 days leading up to the emergency call, she had not been seen by health professionals and was in the care of her parents.</p>
<p>The judge found that the injuries she sustained during that period represented at least three separate attacks.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Leeya must have been shaken and &#8216;come into forceful contact with something hard&rsquo;, on another severe force was applied to her right leg, and on a third she had been bitten.</p>
<p>The judge told Akinrele: &#8216;During the week before she was taken to hospital, it must have been obvious to both you and Kelly that Leeya was a very sick child who needed immediate treatment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On December 18 2006, the baby&rsquo;s father was alone upstairs with his daughter when he carried out the attack that killed her.</p>
<p>The judge said: &#8216;The attack must have taken the form of either violent shaking or throwing the child down hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told Akinrele that her death was the &#8216;culmination of a violent course of conduct committed by you against your daughter over two or three weeks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Your victim could not have been more vulnerable. She was only six weeks old and to your knowledge weak and ill.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is to be expected that any child should look to its parent for protection. What you did to Leeya was a terrible breach of trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The court heard Akinrele had never been interested in his baby, failing to attend ante-natal classes or the birth, during which he turned his phone off to avoid being disturbed.</p>
<p>He saw her &#8216;incessant crying&rsquo; as an &#8216;irritant&rsquo;, the judge said.</p>
<p>The fatal attack, he added, took place during a &#8216;sudden flash of temper&rsquo;.</p>

<p>What a sad country Britain is.  Why in heavens name does a new mother need midwife and health aids to come and visit on a regular basis?  A new mother should be receiving assistance from her mother, sisters, aunts, etc. as well as her own husband.  But since this woman took up with a Nigerian I can only assume that she had no parent&rsquo;s of the functioning sort.</p>
<p>And only 16 years for the BRUTAL murder of a baby?  The UK certainly does not value life in any real sense, does it now.<br>

		<p>OK, so the taxpayers must ante up the money to support him for 16 years?  That money could have gone to educate a gifted child or take care of a retired person, or help to create jobs.  Instead, the taxpayers will be forced to pay room &amp; board for this guy for 16 years.  Diversity is our Greatest Burden. </p>

He&rsquo;s not leaving England for at least 16 years.</p>
<p>After that, as an ex-con, he&rsquo;ll likely go on the dole and get set up in a council estate.</p>
<p>In the end, he gets what he wanted. He&rsquo;ll stay in England.</p>

		<p>Why in heavens name does a new mother need midwife and health aids to come and visit on a regular basis? - Common place in certain sections of society. I suspect the either of them had been of interest to social services/police in the past.</p>
<p>They live in the Fens, a part of England known for poverty and inbreeding, having worked in the social services arena I can make that statement based on what ive seen.</p>
<p>Anyway dont slate the girl, she was only living out the multi racial - living in harmony - im not racist, neo marxist lifestyle thats been banged into her from birth. I doubt if she has an overly high level of literacy.</p>
<p>Interesting point, not one TV new show stated he was an illegal though. Wonder why ?</p>

		<p>Why is it that cases involving infants often involve human bite marks? What would possess a person to start biting the baby? Some sort of primitive evolutionary drive? </p>
<p>It is rare to hear about bite marks on older children and adults but apparently chomping on infants is quite common.</p>

		<p>He is going to be deported back to Nigeria after his 16 years of free lodging, free food, free gymnasium, free remedial training, and all manner of perks, etc. And, if he is not already a Muslim, he will almost certainly be converted to become one by the white-hating Muslim &#8220;priests&#8221; who are allowed to fish for converts in Britains jails looking for prospective terrorist material.  </p>
<p>Now, as I´m sure a Nigerian jail inmate costs the Nigerian tax-payer (if there is such a thing) a tiny fraction (maybe 5%) of what it costs the British taxpayer, why doesnt Britain pay for his keep in a slightly less salubrious Nigerian jail?  The Nigerians govt (if there is such a thing) can charge a hefty mark-up and everyone will be happy, except the criminal of course who has the possibility of finding an internet bride during his stay in a Brit jail.  Or, by the time he gets out, Nigeria may no longer exist.  Or Britain too for that matter!!! <br>

		<p>Both Istvan and JasonC:  I lived/studied in England in the early 80s, and a flatmate&rsquo;s mother was a home health aide.  From her I learned that such state visits were, even back then, mandatory (you know, must have the nanny state making sure you&rsquo;re a government-certified parent rearing your children correctly).  This is not something new and/or only for the lower classes.  Obviously, however, such an intrusive practice still fails at preventing Blacks from murdering children whose &#8220;incessant crying&#8221; (due to being beaten and bitten, perhaps?) was just too irritating.  Unfortunately, I agree with Sbuffalonative:  after this paragon gets out of jail, he&rsquo;ll stay in England in council housing and on the dole for the rest of his misbegotten life.</p>

<p>A lot of people are both manipulative and have psychopathic <i>traits</i> (note the weasel word   &mdash;   Just because you have psychopathic traits doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re a psychopath through and through).  I&rsquo;m manipulative and have a slight few psychopathic propensities.  Is that an excuse for me to batter my six-week old daughter to death?</p>
<p>If read the wrong way, that psychiatrist&rsquo;s report could have gotten him off.  </p>

		<p>As a father, I don&rsquo;t see how anyone could inflict this kind of torture on their own child.  This story is absolutely sickening.  In my ideal world, someone who is capable of this level of perverted cruelty would never be allowed to see the light of day.  Someone who would do this to their own child (or any child) cannot be rehabilitated.  </p>
<p>And, what could this woman and her parents have possibly been thinking?  She was 19 years old when she had the child and obviously younger when she started dating this Nigerian.  Did her parents not have a problem with their teen daughter dating a Nigerian who was in his thirties?  You can blame whoever you want for the downfall of our race   &mdash;   the elites who run our nations, the media, immigrants, etc.   &mdash;   but, in the end, we have no one to blame but ourselves and our failure to shun people like this woman and her  parents.</p>

		<p> Sheila - From her I learned that such state visits were, even back then, mandatory.</p>
<p>Thats correct, however they tend to cease pretty quickly if alls well, I have several well educated friends who received a visit, one visit and thats that.</p>
<p>However a problem family can have two or three visits per DAY in extreme cases, id still say their card was marked previously by the police etc. SO that begs the question, why oh why wasnt there closer monitoring of the situation ? </p>
<p>The girls parents either didnt care and/or thought it hip to have coloured chap in the family, social service were probably afraid of being hit with the stick marked racism hence no real action.</p>
<p>The child may have died an horrific and inhuman death, mother being banged up in jail her life in tatters but at least no one undertook any actions that could have lead to them being called racist.</p>
<p>We will all sleep better knowing that now, wont we ?</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why he, as an illegal criminal immigrant, would not automatically be deported in the event of any future parole. Bad enough the taxpayers have to support his imprisonment. Keeping on the dole then is neither rational nor softhearted but soft headed. Why can&rsquo;t the British have any sense?</p>

		<p>16 Anon: The defiance and willful stupidity of some young people is a major reason for separating the races.  Let them defile themselves, if they must, with drugs or nose rings or tattoos or by slicing their arms with razors or by sleeping around or even by bringing a White bastard into the world.  All these things are merely wounds, not necessarily fatal.  Even the poor little fatherless White infant will be gladly taken and reared by a loving couple if need be.  But a mulatto child is a ball and chain for life for the mother, and a genetic pollutant and threat to the rest of us.  </p>
