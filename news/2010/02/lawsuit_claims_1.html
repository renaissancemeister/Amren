			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Secter and Richard Wronski, Chicago Breaking News Centre, January 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CTA riders have long grumbled about getting a raw deal with high fares and skimpy service, and a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday argues that the complaint is not just real but fueled by policies that favor white commuters over blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>At stake is more than $1 billion in tax dollars split each year among the CTA and the suburban-based commuter railroad and bus lines, Metra and Pace.</p>
<p>Most of the aid goes to the CTA, which serves a far larger share of minority riders than Metra and Pace. But the suit contends that cut is still too low and seeks to remedy things by shifting resources away from the suburban transit agencies. It blames chronic racism for shortchanging the CTA, disproportionately harming black and Hispanic riders.</p>
<p>A controversial  contention, to be sure, and one that some experts think is legally shaky. Even so, the lawsuit, filed by public-interest lawyers, serves to highlight long-standing tensions over how to divvy scarce transit resources in an equitable and smart way among agencies that cater to very different customer bases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CTA officials have lobbied state lawmakers for years to gain a bigger share of the mass-transit funding pot but have never invoked discrimination as an argument. The lawsuit, on the other hand, frames the CTA&rsquo;s chronic funding woes in starkly racial terms while seeking to remedy them by forcing a shift of public resources away from Metra and Pace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spearheading the suit are lawyers from a civil-rights law clinic at Chicago-Kent College of Law and the Loop firm of Futterman Howard Ashley Watkins &amp; Weltman, which specializes in civil-rights litigation.</p>
<p>Futterman associate Rafael Vargas said the idea for the suit was his and grew out of a thesis he wrote four years ago while a law student at Kent that compared &#8220;transit equity&#8221; in Chicago to other U.S. cities. {snip}</p>
<p>Quick to embrace its central thesis was U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Chicago Democrat, who  said the CTA carries 80 percent of all regional transit riders but Metra gets more capital and operating funding per rider from the state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if provable, that may not be enough to pass legal muster, said Andrew Koppelman, a constitutional scholar at the Northwestern University Law School. Koppelman said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that laws that have uneven impacts on blacks and whites are not unconstitutional as long as they don&rsquo;t make clear distinctions on the basis of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Politically, it is quite powerful,&#8221; Koppelman said of the racism  argument laid out in the lawsuit. &#8220;But as a legal argument, it&rsquo;s a loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a minimum, the lawsuit may serve to focus fresh attention on the delicate geographic and political balancing act that has tied the financial fortunes of the three transit agencies together for decades under the umbrella of the Regional Transportation Authority.</p>
<p>The RTA, approved in 1974, was initially a tough sell to suburbanites who feared the increased sales taxes they would have to pay would go largely to prop up a financially ailing CTA system that few of them used.</p>
<p>Ironically, some black community leaders also expressed early qualms about the RTA plan because it lacked guarantees of adequate funding for suburban transit projects that would make it easier for minorities to get to jobs outside the city.</p>
<p>The suit attempts to draw a connection between alleged funding inequalities at the transit agencies and the fractious &#8220;Council Wars&#8221; era in Chicago that began in 1983 with the election of the city&rsquo;s first African-American mayor, Harold Washington.</p>
<p>Racial tensions in the  council spilled over to the legislature, which invoked the first in a series of changes in the funding formula for transit that repeatedly shrunk CTA&rsquo;s share, the suit  said. Ever since, the suit said, the CTA has been unable to invest in &#8220;much-needed&#8221; rail service extensions into minority neighborhoods, including extension of the Red Line.</p>
<p>At the same time, the suit said the RTA has not required Metra to build stations in minority neighborhoods. &#8220;Instead, Metra&rsquo;s trains whiz past these communities as if they do not exist,&#8221; the suit said. &#8220;They do so for a purely racial reason  &mdash;  they do not want their white suburban customers to have to mingle with poor minorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have heard that CTA buses are frequently shot at when they traverse their routes after dark, for no particular reason save the shooter is bored and wants something to target.</p>
<p>If the suburban rail lines get more money, it is probably because they carry people for longer distances.  The CTA does carry more people as a percentage of all transit riders, but it is usually for shorter distances.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a breakdown by race of who&rsquo;s paying the taxes in the Chicago area.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find a large annual transfer from white taxpayers to programs that disproportionately aid blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<p>It probably has more to do with the fact that if they built stops in the ghetto, underclass blacks would have quick and cheap access to white neighborhoods, leading to the usual problems.  I believe something similar happened in St. Louis a few years back.  They put in a mass transit stop near a shopping mall in a white suburb and blacks used the stop to come to the mall and basically trash it and the surrounding area.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re a native or current St. Louisan, but you&rsquo;re talking about the new light rail extension, which made so much sense, because it helps the glut of people who commute from Shrewsbury to the West End.  A stop was put near the Galleria in Richmond Heights, and all it did was make it easier for blacks to patronize/trash the mall.  It got so bad that the mall had to put an Under 17 policy, i.e. between certain hours, if you were under 17, you had to have someone 21 or older with you.  The mall&rsquo;s brocheure advertising the new policy conveniently failed to show blacks:</p>
<p><a href="http://countenance.wordpress.com/2007/05/03/pgr-parental-guidance-required/" rel="nofollow">http://countenance.wordpress.com/2007/05/03/pgr-parental-guidance-required/</a></p>
<p>A Galleria security guard, on his own blog, tried to make an issue out of my making it a racial issue, saying that I was all wrong, b/c race isn&rsquo;t a factor here   &mdash;   he himself stopped mostly white teenagers during the prohibited hours.  However, I responded to him that those were weasel words on his part, b/c it was not groups of white teenagers fighting each other which caused the Galleria to implement this policy.</p>
<p>Also, the Galleria is the only mall in St. Louis on the Missouri side which doesn&rsquo;t allow CCW.  All the other malls, you can pack heat inside as long as you have the carry permit.</p>
<p>The Police Chief in Richmond Heights said not long after one of the fights at the Galleria that the Metro Link was solely responsible for bringing in more black thugs, and he didn&rsquo;t mince racial terms.   For that, he was fired.  Ironically, Robert E. Lee himself gave Richmond Heights its name, back in the days when he was an Army engineer stationed in St. Louis trying to get the Mississippi River from changing course.</p>

<p>And the objection to this is&hellip;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mingling with poor minorities&#8221; is a polite euphemism for rape, murder, assault, beatings, intimidation and robbery.  Why, O why, would those Wicked Racist Whites want to deprive themselves of such Multicultural treats?</p>
<p>The truly sad thing is that Chicago Whites cannot even bring themselves to publicly admit that no, they do <i>not</i> want to &#8220;mingle with poor minorities.&#8221;  And that there is nothing in the least shameful about it.<br>

		<p>If blacks don&rsquo;t like this, why did they vote for Daley? It is the black vote that put the Daleys (Father and son) in and keeps them there.</p>
