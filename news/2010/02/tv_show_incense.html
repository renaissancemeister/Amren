<h1>TV Show Incenses Black Students at UCSD</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eleanor Yang Su, San Diego Union-Tribune, February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students angered by the portrayal of black culture at UC San Diego meet with campus officials early Friday, Feb. 19, 2010.</p>
<p>A student television show last night taking the side of fraternity members who held a party mocking Black History Month has further heightened racial tensions at the University of California San Diego.</p>
<p>About 200 students met with university officials this morning, presenting a six-page list of demands for improved conditions for African-American students.</p>
<p>The demands include free tutoring for black students, a temporary &#8220;safe place&#8221; on campus where intimidated black students can go, a task force with additional funding for outreach, and an effort to hire more black faculty.</p>
<p>The tensions started Monday, when members of Pi Kappa Alpha and other fraternities held the &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; party, {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The story reverberated across the state, and was the subject of an angry news conference by legislators in Sacramento yesterday.</p>
<p>Last night, a show on SRTV  &mdash;  or student-run television  &mdash;  took the side of the partygoers and objected to the reaction from black student groups. The show was led by students involved with The Koala, a publication that has been controversial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The controversy has played out on a backdrop of a school that has 2 percent black enrollment, a statistic that African-Americans have advocated for years to increase with little progress. Some have talked about transferring elsewhere in response to the week&rsquo;s events.</p>

<p>Oh that it were true!  It will never happen. Go somewhere else and have no axe to grind? What fun would that be? There&rsquo;s no profit in putting down ones grievances and going elsewhere. Who would care, or provide a white-guilt handout?</p>
<p>The &#8216;offended&rsquo; 6 or 8 will do what they always do, stake out some gathering place in public. They will sit there with their cellphones and &#8216;bluetoofs&rsquo;,  spitefully staring out at the whites, Asians and Hispanics going about their business of getting educated and going on with their lives. </p>
<p>And no one will care that these uber-sensitive blacks will put themselves even further behind&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Only six pages of demands?  I especially like the &#8220;safe place in the middle of campus&#8221; that they can congregate free from the oppresive racism that envelopes them.  Seriously you have got to see some of these demands.  According to some commenters one teenage black student was screaming at the Chancellor of the school using profanity et cetera.  I am sure that the threat of violence was used if their demands are not met.  </p>

<p>As opposed to every class on campus, where the staff all seem Paid as to how well they can mock white culture.</p>
<p>When the writer says &#8220;the &#8216;Compton Cookout&rsquo; party&#8221;, shouldn&rsquo;t he add &#8216;(sic)&rsquo; - said in context - afterward?</p>

		<p>Sounds like it has the makings for an enlightening meeting. I wonder when the University is going to meet with the white groups on campus? Or do those who most champion the necessity of diversity at all costs, and define diversity by non-white student groups, do they not actually practice the very diversity they champion, not one bit?</p>

		<p>Well, I just had to see pictures of the Compton Cookout.  So I did a google search, and came up with an article on KTLA-TVs site.  No pics, but I happened to glance over at the &#8216;Top Stories&rsquo; sidebar.  Two murders of children; one by a Black &#8216;Dad&rsquo;, who threw his baby into a river; and one by a Black &#8216;Mom&rsquo;, who killed her daughters, and kept them in the freezer.  So&hellip;two out of twelve headline articles deal with blacks killing their own kids.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the invitation&rsquo;s wording does leave the hosts open to criticism.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;d stayed deep in parody, and kept with the &#8216;respect&rsquo; theme, I think they would have gotten away with it.  None of the &#8216;minorities&rsquo; may have even noticed.  But I fear these kids are going to be in trouble, despite the fact that mockery of the absurd has traditionally been an acceptable outlet for dissent (here, dissent from the Liberal Orthodoxy).</p>

I&rsquo;d personally be glad to help them pack their bags! It&rsquo;s a win -win if they left. They&rsquo;d ecscape the &#8216;brutal&rsquo; racisim of that campus, and the university would instantly raise its grade point average.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how &#8220;mocking&#8221; Black History Month has somehow become a punishable offense at UC SD.  To be considered mockery all one would have to do would be to tell the truth about the utter paucity of black achievements throughout the history of the world.  </p>
<p>There is no other race on earth which has had such broad exposure to Western civilization as have black Africans with so little to show for it. Even when whites built advanced countries in Africa blacks destroyed these nations almost as soon as they took power from the white colonials.  </p>
<p>One can but imagine what would happen if UC SD were to offer a course on the true history of post-colonial Africa, or perhaps closer to home, the history of Detroit, St. Louis, Newark, New Orleans, Cleveland, Watts, Gary, or any other American city in which blacks reached critical mass in the past forty years.</p>
<p>Umm, though it&rsquo;s far too early to draw any conclusions, of course, the dim outlines of a pattern just may be emerging&hellip;</p>

		<p>Children in the South during the 1970&rsquo;s who lived near college campuses remember being in the car with their parents while driving on campus and seeing blacks sitting everywhere, on benches, on walls, on cars. Blacks have the most annoying habit of just sitting, often in groups, and eyeballing all white people who walk by. I&rsquo;ve worked with blacks and heard how they talk about white women. When they see a white women and start talking about her amongst themselves, they are always Always ALWAYS talking about fornicating her, and not necessarily with her consent.</p>
<p>But when the parents would see the loafing blacks on campuses, they would always make sure their children understood that the blacks students were just hanging out doing nothing while the whites were indoors studying. </p>
<p>The white liberal elites can complain that the parents were teaching their children racism at an early age, but the liberals will never explain why the blacks weren&rsquo;t studying. They know the blacks didn&rsquo;t need to, because of the help of lenient grading that goes along with lenient admissions.<br>

		<p>&#8220;a temporary &ldquo;safe place&rdquo; on campus where intimidated black students can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would venture to say that the number of black university students who have been severely beaten up, raped or murdered by whites within the last 30 years or so hovers around zero.  Meanwhile, we are constantly treated to reports of promising young whites being beaten, raped or murdered by blacks.  No, it is WHITES who need a &#8220;safe place&#8221; in this country.  It is whites whose skulls are cracked open by blacks, whose daughters are raped and whose elders are beaten up - all this while blacks moan about their hurt feelings.</p>

<p>Another item of interest, &#8220;a safe place temporary or permanent.&#8221;  We white folks need this area much more than blacks.  Read the crime statistics and watch the nightly news, then decide, who needs the safe room?  Do it and don&rsquo;t back up.</p>

		<p>If they want to leave UCSD, great! Nobody&rsquo;s stopping them from leaving, and they certainly won&rsquo;t be missed. Also, why don&rsquo;t they just attend black colleges? Based on what some blacks say, black colleges are as good, if not better, than mainstream universities. </p>
<p>How about we provide decent funds for black colleges and provide incentives for blacks to attend black colleges? That way, white/other non- black students won&rsquo;t have to worry about the presence of blacks on their campus. Blacks can be surrounded by proper &#8220;diversity&#8221; (ie. more black students) while whites don&rsquo;t have to deal with their incessant demands. See, that was easy!</p>

		<p>This is another racial cul-de-sac. </p>
<p>The black students apparently lack the will to rise above what others think of them and apply themselves to academic tasks - and other students (whites, hispanics, asians) notice this lower behavior and inevitably think of them the way they actually act.</p>
<p>In the old days this was generally known as social incompatibility. That&rsquo;s what it still is, but such obvious truth has been declared forbidden by the ever vigilant leftist thought enforcers.</p>
<p>Cul-de-sac.</p>

		<p>Oh, those poor, traumatized souls! They were actually made fun of! The horror!</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know of a 501 c (3) educational non-profit organization that was trying to hold a civilized conference in a reputable hotel, the use of the facilities of which they paid good money for, that was forced out through the use of death threats and intimidation  &mdash;  in three instances in a row! And though this organization sent out press releases detailing the violation of their constitutional civil rights of free speech, the result was yawns from the media. But let a few black students complain that they were made fun of, and the result is a firestorm of media publicity and serious attention given to their demands. </p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no double-standard in this country. No. of course not!</p>

		<p>There is no constitutional right to not be offended.</p>
<p>I see stuff that offends my sensibilities all the time&hellip; but I&rsquo;m not a member of a protected group of people so I&rsquo;m SOL. And even if I was, y&rsquo;know what? I&rsquo;m a bit thicker skinned than that. And that&rsquo;s my recommendation to the black students at UCSD: toughen up. </p>
<p>The sad truth is that the negative black stereotypes that were mocked by the &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; party come directly from blacks themselves, from black American culture. There are no evil whiteys behind the scenes manufacturing a distorted view of black inner-city life. Blacks have created those images themselves and many of them profit off of it quite handsomely. So it&rsquo;s a bit disingenuous to start crying when those stereotypes are used as fodder for mockery. Can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>To black UCSD students: if you have a real problem with people perpetuating those kind of stereotypes, then look in the mirror and start by putting your own house in order.</p>
