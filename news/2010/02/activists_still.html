<h1>Activists Still Vital, Speakers Declare</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Taft Wireback, News &amp; Record (Greensboro, North Carolina), February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On a morning frigid enough to justify hot coffee as a constitutional right, the International Civil Rights Center &amp; Museum debuted Monday amid calls to build upon the legacy of what happened there exactly 50 years earlier.</p>
<p>The outdoor ceremony on South Elm Street capped a 17-year effort to restore the former F.W. Woolworth five-and-dime as a monument to the sit-in movement, which was ignited there Feb. 1, 1960, by four black N.C. A&T; freshmen who simply wanted to sip coffee at the whites-only lunch counter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The facts don&rsquo;t matter if the dream is big enough,&#8221; McCain [Franklin McCain, one of the four black N.C. A&T; freshmen] said, adding that changes always are difficult because people don&rsquo;t like to make them. &#8220;Take pride. Take joy. But more than anything else, take charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas E. Perez, the Obama administration&rsquo;s emissary to the event, echoed McCain&rsquo;s theme that work remains on the civil rights front. Racism still exists both in its most overt and more subtle forms, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need this civil rights museum so that we remember our history, however painful it may be,&#8221; said Perez, assistant attorney general for civil rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a robust civil rights division so that we can continue to break down barriers to equal opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Subtle racism helped make the home-foreclosure crisis worse for &#8220;communities of color&#8221; because unscrupulous lenders preyed on them before the nation&rsquo;s housing bubble burst, he said.</p>
<p>Under Obama&rsquo;s leadership, civil rights lawyers are aggressively enforcing laws aimed at stopping such exploitation, Perez said in a later interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The project itself has faced controversy since its 1993 inception, when the Woolworth chain announced the downtown store&rsquo;s closing. Issues included periods in the late 1990s when it appeared money was being raised aggressively without appreciable progress on the building; the surprise discovery of structural flaws in the building that derailed a plan for opening the museum five years ago; and, more recently, a dispute about building a hotel nearby in a deal that includes Alston as a broker and federal tax credits.</p>

<p>Not true, those predatory lenders would have given anybody, black or white who was stupid enough to agree to their outlandish terms a mortgage. Are blacks currently exempt from buyer beware? This is just more of the same old blaming of others for yet another example of foolish black behavior.</p>

		<p>Woolworth&rsquo;s has a great history as one of the very first chain stores in the United States, but that&rsquo;s not the reason why this building should be preserved. It&rsquo;s because a black man decided to sit down and have coffee there one day.</p>

<p>Racism does exist and it&rsquo;s directed at Whites.</p>
<p>Racism against Whites includes the following:<br>
 <br>
Anti-White AA that locks Whites out of jobs, careers and promotions, favoring lesser, under and un-qualified blacks.</p>
<p>White students shut out of colleges and universities while blacks with significantly lower SAT/ACT scores and lower GPAs are offered early admission, are fawned over and given a full ride.</p>
<p>College scholarships that specify every race except Whites</p>
<p>Black panthers allowed by the Justice Department to intimidate White voters at a polling venue.</p>
<p>A racist US Attorney General, in violation of the &#8216;Equal Protection Clause&rsquo; of the Fourteenth Amendment stating that &#8220;that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A black-on-White crime epidemic that is ignored by the media, government and academia,  &ldquo; &hellip; between 2001 and 2003, blacks were 39 times more likely to commit violent crimes against whites than the reverse, and 136 times more likely to commit robbery&hellip;. blacks committed, on average, 15,400 black-on-white rapes per year, while whites averaged only 900 white-on-black rapes per year.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, sir, is blatant racism.</p>
<p>A monument should be built to White victims of black crimes.</p>
<p>To that I would contribute.  Until blacks stop attacking, robbing, murdering, and raping Whites, until Whites are granted Civil Rights, I will contribute nothing and indeed resent any of my tax dollars used to preserve black &#8216;heritage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Banks made loans to Blacks and Hispanics with bad credit because the Clinton Administration threatened to take them to court for &#8220;discrimination in lending&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m no friend of the money business, but the lenders&rsquo; trickery was necessary to protect their assets.    </p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Civil Rights Lawyers threatened to sue claiming &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; if these sub-prime loans were not made to colored people!  (Here is a link to Vdare.com article  https://tinyurl.com/yzp8y2z )</p>

		<p>Yes, racism does exist.  I see it all the time.  As a white person, I get blamed for all the failures of blacks.  As a white person, my taxes are used to fund black agendas, black countries, etc, only to be hated and called a racist.  As a white person, I walked in black neighborhoods and felt the hate just being there.  </p>

Can&rsquo;t have that! What would happen to the race industry? It would fall apart! Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton would have to get legitimate jobs and work for a living.</p>

		<p>The real reason racism still exist is that so many people are working so desperately to keep it alive. If we could go through a whole day without reading or hearing the words, racism, racist, bigot, African-American, whitey, etc., it would go a long way toward aleviating racism, whatever it may be. A big start would be to stop putting up museums for every little thing that a supposed racist white person did to some unsuspecting black. </p>

		<p>Does anyone notice the themes of black history? It&rsquo;s all about emphasizing the fact that they&rsquo;ve been oppressed by other groups and not about cultural or scientific achievements that blacks have had. In other words, blacks have produced nothing of value and their history is all about the other groups who have attacked them.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how most black comedians, for example, make their living.  They crack jokes on white people.  Paul Mooney is a good example.  He is mad about slavery, which, I think ended&hellip;oh, almost 100 years before he was born.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Woolworth&rsquo;s stores still exist in Germany and are doing well there, but they have all been phased out in the USA.  I wonder why.</p>
<p>PS.  I may be wrong, but didn&rsquo;t that Woolworth&rsquo;s store in NC have a separate colored section? The store, like any, was in business to make money; it was not in business to turn down paying customers with cash in hand. Just as Rosa Parks COULD have sat in the colored section of the bus, but refused, these men could have had their coffee in the colored section.No problem.  The whole point is that they wanted to sit in the &#8220;whites only&#8221; section. They were not denied any coffee; they were not denied food or service; but what they really wanted was integration, not food&hellip; which the customs and laws of the locale did not allow. It was not the store&rsquo;s concern, really. </p>
<p>Similarly, I find in Europe that it&rsquo;s the common perception that prior to the famous Little Rock show-down, blacks in the USA were not allowed to go to school. That is utterly wrong! They were not denied education. They WERE allowed to go to school   &mdash;   but to THEIR OWN schools. But no, they wanted to go to white schools.  That whole Little Rock thing was not about education, but about integration.  It&rsquo;s so distorted and misunderstood today! In the same way, this Woolworth&rsquo;s incident was not about being able to have something to eat, but about being allowed to eat WITH WHITES.</p>

		<p>The very fact that Paul Mooney can get away with what he says while making a great living illustrates the numerous rights and privileges blacks enjoy in the United States. Try being a Uighur comedian who disparages Han Chinese, or a Korean comedian in Japan who insults the native Japanese, and just see how long they last. </p>
