	<p>Tom Tancredo wants voters to have to pass a civics and literacy test.</p>
<p>Former congressman Tom Tancredo took heat Friday for remarks at the national Tea Party convention that critics viewed as calling for a return to Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>But Tancredo said he wasn&rsquo;t targeting a specific group when he suggested in Nashville there should be a &#8220;civics-literacy&#8221; test before someone could vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who could not even spell the word &#8216;vote&rsquo; or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House,&#8221; Tancredo said in his opening-day speech Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tests were used to prevent blacks from voting during segregation and were banned by the Voting Rights Act in 1964.</p>
<p>Tancredo said Friday that his call for a civics-literacy test dates to 2007, when he was a Republican presidential candidate and was impressed with how much an immigrant he met on the trail knew about America.</p>
<p>Told his remarks were creating an uproar  &mdash;  particularly among liberal bloggers  &mdash;  Tancredo laughed and joked that they were &#8220;quoting me accurately again.&#8221; He then bemoaned what he called &#8220;the left&rsquo;s obsession with race.&#8221;</p>
<p>State House Speaker Terrance Carroll, the first black speaker in Colorado history, said there&rsquo;s a reason Tancredo&rsquo;s remarks are being viewed racially.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s saying them in relationship to Barack Obama,&#8221; said Carroll, a Denver Democrat. &#8220;What does he expect people to think?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s calling for things that, thank God, were banned and were part of Jim Crow life,&#8221; said Heidi Beirich, research director at the Southern Poverty Law Center. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Tancredo said his call for a test is strictly based on his desire to get participation only from voters who understand the government.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s insanity, pure insanity, I tell ya, that people who choose who runs the government (at least in theory) should know basic civics.  Tom Tancredo must be some sort of right wing extremist or something   &mdash;   Nevertheless, he uses too much common sense.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I would be happy with backing off of public service campaigns that tell people it&rsquo;s their patriotic duty to vote, even if they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re voting for.</p>

		<p>The funny thing is that no one ever accuses the people who that just about anyone should have the right to vote that they wish to promote voter fraud. Maybe they are afraid that only truly intelligent black people will vote. And vote against the parasites of their own race.</p>

<p>These people can&rsquo;t find a reasonable argument against using tests to prevent idiots from voting. As a result, they play the race-card by associating Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s ideas with purported racism from the past.</p>
<p>I think there ought to be IQ tests for voting. People need to be able to have an intellect sufficient for knowing who they&rsquo;re actually putting into office. Sure, there will be a disparate impact on blacks &mdash; since they have lower average scores on IQ tests &mdash; but disparate impact does not equate with racism.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a civics-literacy test for those who legitimately apply for citizenship to the US, but since millions of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are pouring across the border without even applying for citizenship, the process has obviously been circumvented. Now Tancredo is proposing a very reasonable alternative: apply the test when voting, since our wonderful government is failing to do it upon entry. Of course he will be blasted as a racist for proposing this  by the leftists, especially since he dares to mention Obama while doing so!</p>

		<p>Our founders had a very good reason for not extending the franchise to everyone.  If you have no stake in the country&rsquo;s success or survival; if you have no understanding of the basics of economics; if you do not understand what a representative republic is you have no business voting.  Being able to read and write English on a 6th grade level is not an unreasonable expectation.</p>
<p>The American people, and especially her politicians, have no respect for citizenship.  We have lost all sense of civic pride.  The fact that someone can register to vote by mail shows how little we value our American citizenship.  So what if a non-citizen registers to vote?  So what if a insane or retarded person votes?  So what if we have no standards whatsoever as to who can vote, we have very few standards for anything else.</p>
<p>When I first registered to vote I had to go to the county court house and register in person.  I do not think that was such an onerous thing to do.  In fact we might not even need a literacy test for voting if we just required each voter to register in person.  The effort alone would stop quite a few morons right in their tracks.  Oh, and don&rsquo;t tell me how inconvenient that would be for low income workers.  The people who go the most days (voluntarily) without pay are the workers at the lowest end of the pay scale.  So don&rsquo;t tell me we all can&rsquo;t take a half day every four years or so to renew a voter&rsquo;s registration card.<br>

<p>Yawn!</p>
<p>The country was better off with the Jim Crow laws, there is no doubt in my mind here; just as the real and only South Africa, was thriving under Apartheid. </p>
<p>When you let the truculently illiterate and arrogantly ignorant vote, you only foster destruction. When race and Communism are considered in that mix, all bets are off. It is no longer destruction that you chase, but a one way trip into the abyss.</p>
<p>Bring them back, bring them back; thus, we may thank God Almighty for his favor in us, by bringing them back!<br>

We can only hope that these remarks by Tancredo as well as the &#8220;proud racist&#8221; in Santa Clarita start a trend of people being more outspoken without fear of the nutjob Left&rsquo;s response.</p>

		<p>Opposition to a voter registration requirement that one can demonstrate, say, a 6th grade reading level on the basis that it&rsquo;s a return to &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; laws is an admission by liberals that they believe blacks and Hispanics will never master that basic ability.  So once again, liberals prove that they are more racist than I am.  I accept the overwhelming evidence that there are significant IQ differences among the races, but even I can see that the great majority of blacks can learn to read if they want to.</p>
<p>The truly strange belief is the one held by everyone from leftists to middle of the road neocons   &mdash;   that it is somehow possible to have a successful democracy when the electorate is illiterate, ignorant, and can&rsquo;t understand the language the laws are written in.<br>

		<p>QD, first of all, you&rsquo;ll be proud of me for having exercised self restraint on the BBQ wars comment you made on the soul food blog earlier. You know, it seems like these public service announcements imply that failure to vote is some sort of moral crime. There is no benefit to larding the electorate with ill informed and shallow thinking voters. An ignorant vote casts out an informed vote every time. It seems like liberals benefit from these sort of promise &#8216;em everything campaigns as well.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll probably never get a return to literacy/civics tests for voting, but there&rsquo;s something literate/knowledgeable citizens CAN do that many don&rsquo;t:  VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!!  Vote each and every time there&rsquo;s an election!  Vote absentee if you think there&rsquo;s a good chance you won&rsquo;t be able or willing to get to the polls!  Does anyone believe Obama would be Prez if whites had voted in the numbers blacks did?  If you can&rsquo;t cast a positive vote, then at least cast a negative one by voting for the lesser of evils or even writing someone in!</p>

<p>If we were to have such a test it would mean that voting is no longer a right of the people. It would become a privilege that the government gives to the people.</p>
<p>What we need are ways to remove laws that are contrary to the constitution that&rsquo;s effective. We need new ways to ensure that the constitution is followed. We need new ways to insure that the supreme court can&rsquo;t produce contradicting rulings based upon limited circumstances. We need a set of criteria for cases that the supreme court must hear and that it can&rsquo;t turn a blind eye too.</p>
<p>We need to get rid of the Federal reserve system and Fiat currency. If we can do that one thing everything will change. If we don&rsquo;t every social police that increases the size of the national dept will win out and free heath care to illegals is one of them.  </p>
<p>Right now it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether a person votes Democrat or Republican, the parties are the same. The focus should be on Washington not the voters.</p>

I also had to go to my local city hall to register. This was in 1976. This was after most so called civil rights voteing laws had passed. If we go back to this simple practice it do alot for the movement.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be the only person voting in your precinct, or Congressional district, or in your state?  Politics would sure be far more to your liking.</p>
<p>Not voting is a form of voting, if you think about it.</p>
<p>16 Dave:</p>
<p>I have to disagree with you disagreement with TT.  Voting is not a right, just as you have a right not to listen to the opinions of others.  Government doesn&rsquo;t have to heed every opinion, nor take everyone&rsquo;s vote into account in figuring who are its elected representatives.  But if you do have the privilege to vote, you do have the right not to have your vote diluted by cemeteries and prisons.</p>

<p>If whites had voted for McCain we&rsquo;d have the same policies from an old white man instead of a young black man.  We suffer from a moral and cultural sickness that has no political solution.  Even if there was a political solution, neither party has the Weltanschauung to deliver it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Why would the Denver Post be quoting Heidi Beirich, a member of a hate organization (the Southern Poverty Law Center)?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the Denver Post is a member of an anti-White hate organization:  The MSM.</p>
<p>She and mark potok and foxman of the ADL are considered by the MSM the ultimate experts on hate  &mdash;  their lofty opinions are all that matters, they are the arbiters of what constitutes hate, hate crimes and hate speech.  Whenever a definition is needed by a journalist or MSM editor as to what constitutes a Hate (committed only by Whites) those three are dredged up for the usual anti-White, racist rant  &mdash;   repeating the usual clap trap about White &#8216;Nazis&rsquo;, &#8216;haters&rsquo; and &#8216;extremists&rsquo; without rebuttal, with calls for the government to &#8216;crack down&rsquo; on White Supremacist organizations and Hate Groups like the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so predictable and tiresome as the MSM become increasingly more irrelevant and dies!</p>
<p>Good news viz. The Denver Post:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Denver Post announced the layoffs of six newsroom managers as part of a cost-cutting effort&hellip;.MediaNews Group is negotiating with union-covered Post employees for $2 million in wage and benefit concessions&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this from the above article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;People who could not even spell the word &lsquo;vote&rsquo;or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House,&rsquo; Tancredo said&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.  Those who cannot spell the word &#8216;vote&rsquo;  &mdash;  and there are millions of them in California  &mdash;  are the most susceptible and open to marxist slogans such as &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; without questioning or understanding what &#8216;hope&rsquo; and &#8216;change&rsquo; mean.  The Road to Hell is&hellip;.</p>
<p>The new illiterate, innumerate, low IQd replacement class only votes along racial or simplistic, idealistic lines  &mdash;  whoever looks like them, promises the most Free White Money and/or pledges to allow more non-Whites to freely immigrate to the US from the Third World.</p>
<p>To tweak Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s great quote a bit:  &#8220;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out MONEY&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what is happening in California  &mdash;  the state is out of money  &mdash;  there is no &#8216;other people&rsquo;s money&rsquo; as taxpayers and businesses have fled in droves and the tax base has shrunk further and cannot keep up with the parasitic class.  </p>
<p>Yet the new up and coming hispanic voting bloc, with no understanding of economics and believing the government has an endless supply of White Money to distribute, continue to vote in politicians that vow to expand the welfare state and punish Whiter producers via heavy taxes. </p>
<p>California caters to two classes:  Welfare recipients and Government Employee Unions.  As for the future?</p>
<p>As Yeats explained:</p>
<p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed&hellip;</p>
