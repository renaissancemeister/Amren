			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cleopatra Andreadis and Chris Francescani, ABC News, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman who was at the center of the phony Duke lacrosse rape case was arrested today and charged with attempted murder.</p>
<p>The Durham Police Department told ABC News that Crystal Gale Mangum got into an argument with her boyfriend, Milton Walker, shortly after midnight on Thursday.</p>
<p>The arrest warrant claims that Mangum, 33, scratched, punched and threw objects at Walker before taking all of his clothes and setting them on fire in a bath tub. Firefighters were sent to the home to extinguish the blaze.</p>
<p>Police said they had to evacuate three children, ages 10, 9 and 3, from the apartment because of the fire. It was not immediately known whose children they were.</p>
<p>Mangum is charged with first-degree attempted murder for communicating a threat because she allegedly told Walker in front of officers, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to stab you [expletive]!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was also charged with five counts of arson, simple assault, identity theft, damage to property and resist, delay and obstruction of justice. In addition, she faces three counts of child endangerment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mangum triggered a furor in 2006 when she accused three Duke Lacrosse players of raping her while working at an off campus party. Prosecutor Mike Nifong heightened the seriousness of the charges by declaring the alleged assault a hate crime.</p>

		<p>Yeah, she will get charged with arson, simple assault, identity theft, damage to property and resist, delay and obstruction of justice, but will they follow through.</p>
<p>She will spin a new tale of being the victim of white racism and the prosecutor will back off and quietly drop the charges.  That is how it works.</p>

		<p>Remember the Duke 88 who made their big splash long before the evidence was in? </p>
<p>What must they now say about the &#8220;sound of a social disaster&#8221;, as in Mangum Liar loosing control of herself and almost killing her boyfriend in front of her children?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always enlivening when liberals pull for the thugs and then the thugs live up to our worst stereotypes, almost as if to intentionally make fools of the liberals. Either way, we are vindicated.</p>
<p>Every time an African American gets in touch with the natural African within and &#8220;acts out while dey be kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221;, all my &#8220;racist&#8221; white ancestors are vindicated again for eternity.</p>
<p>https://www.concerneddukefaculty.org/</p>
<p>As a statement about campus culture, the ad deplores a &#8220;Social Disaster,&#8221; as described in the student statements, which feature racism, segregation, isolation, and sexism as ongoing problems before the scandal broke, exacerbated by the heightened tensions in its immediate aftermath. The disaster is the atmosphere that allows sexism, racism, and sexual violence to be so prevalent on campus. The ad&rsquo;s statement that the problem &#8220;won&rsquo;t end with what the police say or the court decides&#8221; is as clearly true now as it was then. Whatever its conclusions, the legal process will not resolve these problems.<br>

		<p>Read this excerpt and you will get perfect insight into the African American attitude toward social justice and Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;We are the moral theme of this country&#8221;.  This is African American morality at is best:</p>
<p>https://hnn.us/blogs/entries/24306.html</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Newsweek, a student at predominantly African-American North Carolina Central carried the Duke 88&rsquo;s thinking to its logical, if absurd, extreme. The student said that he wanted to see the Duke students prosecuted &ldquo;whether it happened or not. It would be justice for things that happened in the past.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Stories like this drive me crazy. I don&rsquo;t have any sympathy for Crystal Gale Magnum, believe me, but the charges against her are wildly inflated and exaggerated as usual  &mdash;  standard operating procedure for the police these days.</p>
<p>Telling someone you&rsquo;re going to stab them becomes &#8220;attempted murder.&#8221; Setting some clothes on fire in a bathtub becomes &#8220;arson.&#8221; Giving the cops a phony name becomes &#8220;identity theft.&#8221; And where did they come up with FIVE counts of arson? Did she burn five different items of clothing? Let&rsquo;s see: two socks, underwear, pants and a shirt. That&rsquo;s five items right there. Could it be?</p>
<p>Now, I suppose you could say that this is karma for the Duke Rape case because she&rsquo;s being set up on all these bogus charges, but this practice of charge inflation should bother everyone. After all, it could happen to any one of us at any time. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of what I&rsquo;m talking about. You remember the female astronaut who stalked her boyfriend&rsquo;s (suspected) lover a couple years ago? She was charged with &#8220;attempted kidnapping&#8221; because she tried to open the woman&rsquo;s car door. She was charged with &#8220;tampering with evidence&#8221; because she threw some papers in a dumpster. I&rsquo;m not kidding. That&rsquo;s how petty this stuff is and these perversions of justice go on all the time. They are standard operating procedure in the courts.</p>
<p>This system has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with headlines and personal ambition. The cops and DA&rsquo;s pile on the charges, no matter how ludicrous, in order to coerce plea bargains. The whole system is based on coercive plea bargaining. In other words, it&rsquo;s geared towards forcing people to plead guilty  &mdash;  frequently to crimes they didn&rsquo;t commit and which everybody knows they didn&rsquo;t commit. Nifong was a particularly egregious example of the process, but there was nothing that unusual about him. His only problem was that the accused had enough money to actually defend themselves.</p>
<p>Coercive plea bargaining is the reason why somebody like Nancy Grace could have a hundred-percent conviction rate as a prosecutor. The &#8220;justice&#8221; system&rsquo;s broken. It&rsquo;s an absolute fraud. As for Crystal Gale, she&rsquo;ll plead guilty to some reduced charge probably. They always do, even when they&rsquo;re innocent. I won&rsquo;t be sobbing in my beer about what happens to her, though. Sometimes even the most corrupt systems can deliver justice in spite of themselves.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s back and stinking things up, like a female OJ. I wonder how the msm will handle this. My bet, a low-key honesty about the current charges and a passing reference to her (infamous) prior conduct. About her lifelong habits of making false accusations, drug use, and slaternly behavior  &mdash;  no remarks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;by declaring the alleged assault a hate crime&#8221;&hellip;..</p>
<p>This allegation is no longer alleged, it has now been proven beyond all doubt to have been a false accusation.</p>
<p>I hate the MSM. A rape is alleged - the boys are guilty by virtue of accusation alone, (if they were not rich a plea would have been taken), only after years of lies being exposed are the charges dropped&hellip;.</p>
<p>But still its an &#8220;alleged&#8221; assault&hellip;. IT NEVER HAPPENED!!!</p>

		<p>3 VreTron&rsquo;i:</p>
<p>I downloaded the pdf file that was your final URL.  It is little more than the screed of a black man who thinks he&rsquo;s a lot smarter than he actually is, and thinks that everyone else thinks he&rsquo;s that smart.  The one part that jumped out at me is when he said something like, &#8220;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be a black man on campus, walking somewhere at night, and cop cars pass you by all the time.&#8221;  Evidently, he musn&rsquo;t be doing anything wrong, for they&rsquo;re driving by him, and not accosting him.</p>
<p>The obvious response is this:  You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be a white man on campus, walking somewhere at night, and black men are constantly surrounding you.</p>

<p>The Duke 88, as learned and as erudite as they are, and quite sensitive to race - even as learned as they are - somehow failed to notice that 20,000 white women are raped by black men each year while around 40 black women are raped by white men, year after year. Seems as though they believed quite the opposite to be the case. </p>

		<p>Gee, I&rsquo;m shocked to read this story! Who would have thought that poor Crystal Magnum would lose her way after her 15 minutes of fame. I would imagine that in 10 - 15 years we will be reading of similar behavior from her kids. I guess the Nifong lottery turned out to be a bust. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with Anonymous #5 about charge inflation. One of the side stories to the whole Duke rape debacle is that the cab driver who took one of the players home was targeted for an old shoplifting charge. It seems that a few years earlier he had the misfortune of taxiing people home who had shoplifted from a Durham area store. At the time I was waiting for Nifong to charge the bank, the fast food joint and the Duke University security system for having recorded transactions that proved one of the accused was not at the house but on his way back to his dorm room. It&rsquo;s kind of pointless to throw an ATM in jail, though! The only reasons that Nifong is not currently the Attorney General of NC are the Internet and the fact that these players families had fairly deep pockets. If all three came from homes where Dad and Mom made $100,000 together, each and every one of them would be sitting in the klink right now.  </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re so right about the system. It&rsquo;s not about finding innocence or guilt, it&rsquo;s about the state or the defense winning. The state piles on all these charges. Most people don&rsquo;t have the money to fight them, so they are forced to cop a plea to a lesser charge. I knew man who worked part time at a pawn shop. He was a nice, decent man with no criminal record. There were around 12 people employed in this shop. The police raided it claiming that there was embezzlement going on. All  were arrested. They charged this man with around 3 counts, one was organized crime, then embezzlement,then theft and actually there may have been a fourth charge, all felonies. There was no evidence whatsoever against this man. His supervisors had his password so could have stolen under his name anytime. He was told by his lawyer, just an average on, not some high powered one, that it would cost him at least 12,000  to go to trial and he made slightly too much for the state to provide him with an attorney. A visiting judge came, dropped all charges saying there was no evidence. Well, the DA reinstated the charges after the regular judge came back. Finally, after dragging this poor man  through the courts for 3 long years, reguiring him once a month to take off from work all day to come to court, sit there only to have it rescheduled, they agreed reduce the  charge to one misdemeanor theft charge resulting in a small fine. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to fight it so he was forced to plead no contest. This caused him to lose his job because in it, he handled large sums of money, which he had for years, with no theft or problem. He was very bitter about being forced to do this, at his plea hearing, he told the judge he didn&rsquo;t do it and that there was no evidence that he did. It did no good. It&rsquo;s all about winning and lawyers and police making their careers,NOT about justice.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous #5:</p>
<p>Wow&hellip;you&rsquo;ve had some bad experience with the police. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a cop for almost 13 years, so I can empathize with your statements about inflated charges, pompous prosecutors, cops on power trips, etc. Truly, I&rsquo;ve seen some unprofessional conduct, but it&rsquo;s generally from officers and prosecutors who let the job become personal (like Richard Nifong). </p>
<p>However, as for your rather cavalier comments questioning the link between a stabbing and attempted murder, ummmm&hellip;.let&rsquo;s see how forgiving you are should the brutally sharp point of the weapon be finding its way into YOUR flesh. </p>
<p>And the arson&hellip;what if your apartment was immediately above Ms. Mangum&rsquo;s as she roasted the laundry in the bathtub? Pretty easy to beat up on the cops when you stand safely disconnected from the violent events themselves. </p>
<p>As for the kidnapping charge against the former astronaut&hellip;again, from the safety of your keyboard it probably looks like a black-and-white discussion of the law. However, imagine you&rsquo;re sitting in your car in a parking garage, talking on your cell phone, and some lunatic walks up, smashes out a window, rips your car door open, grabs your neck in one hand and your hair in the other, and then rips you out of the seat and down onto the pavement. The lunatic begins kicking you in the head and shoulders, sprays you with pepper spray, screaming profanity&hellip;..hmmmmm, still willing to debate the kidnapping issue?</p>
<p>You might hate the police - and that&rsquo;s your right and privilege - but come on, put yourself in the victim&rsquo;s shoes before you rip the charges down. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 7:32PM: I live in Durham and the local news has been covering this in much more detail.</p>
<p>The attempted murder happened before the police got there. One of Crystal&rsquo;s children called the police.</p>
<p>She told the boyfriend &#8220;I&rsquo;m gonna stab you&#8221; while the police were standing right there. So they sort of HAD to include the &#8220;communicating threats&#8221; charge.</p>
<p>She gave the police a false name and birthdate. &#8220;Identity theft&#8221; may not be the best charge for that, but she sure deserved to get charged for something. And if the false name and birthdate belong to a real person, then it IS identity theft. </p>
<p>WRAL news this morning reported that she started the fire while the police were in the house, too. I suspect maybe the criminal charges are going to eventually be replaced with a civil commitment, and she&rsquo;s going to get a nice long rest up in Butner (the state mental hospital).</p>

<p>   I&rsquo;ve known quite a few cops in my time and I&rsquo;ve never had any problem with any of them. I would say that police, as a whole, are more racially aware that than any other profession that I&rsquo;ve encountered. If things really degenerated to anarchy in this country, most Southern, Midwestern, rural, etc. police could be counted on to be on our side  &mdash;  no doubt about it.</p>

		<p>The arson and child endangerment charges can probably stick, but unless she actually stabbed her boyfriend, there is simply no way to make the &#8220;attempted murder&#8221; charge hold any water.  If she brandished it and threatened him - and that&rsquo;s all - then the appropriate charge would be &#8220;assault with a deadly weapon&#8221;.  The false name and birthdate would be &#8220;criminal impersonation&#8221;, rather than &#8220;identity theft&#8221;.</p>
<p>And yes, karma sure is wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?  This gal thought it was just great when four innocent whites were being railroaded under her own frivolous charges, but I&rsquo;ll bet now she thinks this sort of thing isn&rsquo;t quite so funny.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Telling someone you&rsquo;re going to stab them becomes &ldquo;attempted murder.&rdquo; Setting some clothes on fire in a bathtub becomes &ldquo;arson.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, so the police get a little creative with their charges.  Doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that she set fire to a guy&rsquo;s stuff, threatened him before witnesses, &amp; lied to the cops.  </p>
<p>Some real special brand of stupid at work there. </p>

		<p>I am sorry for all those who have suffered injustice at the hands of prosecutors since they have the unlimited resources- and arrogance- of the state on their side, but I don&rsquo;t think it is fair to lump the cops in with them. I agree with the pro-cop sentiment even though I know there are power-trippers out there amongst them. All I can say is this: if you were a cop, a dad, with two kids at home, and you had to walk up to the driver&rsquo;s side window of a tinted out car in a black part of town, at night, how much would you pay NOT to have to do it? Twenty? Fifty? A hundred?<br>
Remember if you&rsquo;re a cop you HAVE to do it.</p>

<p>Yes, I didn&rsquo;t properly research that element of my post. </p>
<p>I think it would&rsquo;ve been more appropriate to simply say the following:</p>
<p>Easy to debate the merits of kidnapping when one isn&rsquo;t facing a potential kidnapper. </p>
<p>Admittedly, after 13 years in police work, I readily acknowledge that there are a number of badge-heavy bullies within the profession, and that charges are sometimes needlessly inflated when officers allow a case to get personal. However, statistically, that sort of event is an absolute anomaly. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I find that many people have a rather negative view of police&hellip;..until they need one. </p>

		<p>&#8220;You might hate the police - and that&rsquo;s your right and privilege - but come on, put yourself in the victim&rsquo;s shoes before you rip the charges down&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here hates the police. What is hated is the fact that some police and especially the DA too often inflate charges either because there is a lack of common sense, they&rsquo;re on a power kick or to ensure that they win in court. It should be about justice. In my opinion, attempted murder is ridiculous, she should be charged with making a threat and as somone else said, criminal impersonation for claiming to be someone else. I could see how the child endangerment charges could stick. Arson, not really since they were his clothes and it was in a bathtub, not the same as setting the house on fire.</p>

		<p>Poster #12 is absolutely right about the lads from Duke spending serious time in the klink were it not for their parents with deep pockets. </p>
<p>But wasn&rsquo;t their pampered, sheltered upbringing what made them so naive that they would hire a black stripper in the first place?  How many working-class whites enrolled in a small state school would have employed the services of the lovely Ms. Mangum? </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Crystal Gale Mangum can turn her troubled life around, although I have my doubts.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m observing the contretemps between Quiet Professional, Techno Dan and others about the abuses of power.  Something that should be cleared up here is that the ones who pile on these charges are the prosecutors, not the cops.  Law enforcement technically has no prosecutorial power, though I know the prosecutors rely heavily on LEOs for evidence.  If there is an axe to grind about the abuse of power by DAs, CAs and SAs, it&rsquo;s not against the cops.</p>

<p>I agree completely with all of your post except your wishing this vile woman well. They should have NEVER used a black stripper. Had she been White and made the same crazy false charges, the media would never have noticed and the race-pimps wouldn&rsquo;t have crawled out from under their rocks. The LESSON here is to NEVER, EVER use a black &#8220;dancer&#8221;, stripper, etc, when you have a party, stag, etc.</p>

		<p>&#8220;However, as for your rather cavalier comments questioning the link between a stabbing and attempted murder, ummmm&hellip;.let&rsquo;s see how forgiving you are should the brutally sharp point of the weapon be finding its way into YOUR flesh.&#8221;</p>
<p>What weapon? Was there an actual knife involved here? As far as I can tell, she was charged with attempted murder for something she SAID. </p>
<p>&#8220;And the arson&hellip;what if your apartment was immediately above Ms. Mangum&rsquo;s as she roasted the laundry in the bathtub? Pretty easy to beat up on the cops when you stand safely disconnected from the violent events themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios. She burned some clothes in a bath tub.That doesn&rsquo;t sound like &#8220;arson&#8221; to me. I guess technically it is, though. Technically, I could be charged with arson for burning a match.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the kidnapping charge against the former astronaut&hellip;again, from the safety of your keyboard it probably looks like a black-and-white discussion of the law. However, imagine you&rsquo;re sitting in your car in a parking garage, talking on your cell phone, and some lunatic walks up, smashes out a window, rips your car door open, grabs your neck in one hand and your hair in the other, and then rips you out of the seat and down onto the pavement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, that&rsquo;s not what happened. She walked up and tried to open the car door. That&rsquo;s it. </p>

		<p>To Anonymous #33:</p>
<p>At some point I must simply resign myself to a tendency to empathize. After 13 years in police work I am MORE prone to see things from a victim&rsquo;s point of view than LESS. </p>
<p>Admittedly, having found myself watching countless victims try to piece their lives back together, I have apparently lost the roughened exterior you apparently have mastered. </p>
<p>Is Milton Walker a top-notch citizen? I have no idea. Is he really a victim? Again, no idea. Quite frankly, I reacted more to your flashpoint, hostile view of the police than I did any true concern for his well-being. </p>
<p>I still must ask though&hellip;were someone close to you (spouse, mother, child, etc.) to &#8220;just&#8221; have their car door opened by a hostile, spurned-lover type of co-worker, would you go along quietly when the investigating officer shrugged it off as simply &#8220;tampering with an auto&#8221;? (A suitable charge here in my jurisdiction for what&rsquo;s been described.)</p>
<p>I think that perhaps what leaves me most exposed to caustic replies like yours is simply the level of hostility so many citizens feel towards police.</p>
<p>It is what it is. </p>

		<p>And what about Nancy Grace?  Is she going to discuss this &#8220;miscarriage of justice&#8221; against poor Crystal the same way she carried on for days and days about how the Duke white boys (already presumed guilty by her) were going to get away with their alleged crime due to their privileged race?</p>
<p>Funny how, other than the NY Times, I somehow missed the major media reporting on this latest chapter of &#8220;The Misadventures of Crystal Mangum&#8221;.  Wonder why it didn&rsquo;t make my local news ;)</p>
