		<p>Gates is just another white radical that puts profits over loyalty.  First it was his refusal to hire US citizens for high tech jobs, preferring to get cheap labor from overseas.  Now he&rsquo;s ignoring whites and treating them as second class citizens.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a pitiful example of the business world in America today.</p>

Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I see every race listed except Whites. Waiting for your reply.</p>

		<p>Bill GAtes is a traitor. The computer industry which made him a billionare was incubated for 4 decades in tax payer funded-White tax payer- goverment research programs. In appreciation of 40 years of White Tax payer subsidies, the parasite Gates used his great fortune to buy both Republican and Democratic politicians who voted to import predatory asian LEGAL IMMIGRANT scab labor who stole and continue to steal jobs and wages from NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. In other words, the parasite Bill Gates was able to force NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS to give him a massive wage concession. To put it another way, the parasite Gates was legally allowed to steal the wealth of Native Born White workers.</p>
<p>Gates used this stolen wealth to set up a scholarship foundation that gives scholarship money to the children of the predatory asian scab workers-LEGAL IMMIGRANTS- who stole jobs and wages from NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN WORKERS.com</p>
<p>I have no doubt that some of the recipients of the Gates scholar ship have grandfathers who served in the Japanese Imperial army during WW2.</p>
<p>There is no limit to Bill Gates extreme hatred for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. During the past year, he publicly stated that &#8220;WE&#8221; need to import asians programmers and engineers becasue &#8220;they&#8221; are smarter than White Americans.</p>
<p>Bill Gates should be stripped of his US citizenship and sent to the Sudan-one way ticket.</p>
<p>Behind every great fortune is a great crime.</p>

		<p>I thought I heard some time ago about someone making a whites-only scholarship a few years ago. From what I heard, it was supposed to be used to highlight the inequity of racial preference. Of course, it created outrage and controversy, just like anything else to help white people does.</p>

		<p>I can tell you how to get past that little racial inconvenience.  Change your name (it&rsquo;s easy to do, especially in CA where every actor in town has changed his/her name) - but change your LAST name to an Hispanic or other easily recognizable minority surname.  It worked perfectly for a friend of mine; she had married an Hispanic, they divorced, and she got a free ride thru nursing school and beyond - eventually became Director of Nursing at a major hospital.  Hey, ganders, we&rsquo;ve got sauce too!!</p>

<p>Actually, the list of requirements already states that applicants have to meet Federal Pell Grant eligibility criteria, which is basically a limit on income and assets of the applicant.</p>
<p>So the white exclusion is purely in addition to an economic need requirement.  The powers that be are now completely shameless in displaying their anti-white agenda.<br>

		<p>There he goes again!</p>
<p>Bill Gates has done this kind of thing before, almost ten years ago, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p>
<p>He is not only the worst kind of nerd you could imagine, he,s a traitor to his race, and his own nation.</p>
<p>The thing is, he&rsquo;s no genius; he stole most of his &#8220;ideas&#8221; from Apple and Xerox (to name a few), and has routinely been taken to court for it&hellip; He is the quintessential money-sucking parasite!</p>
<p>But back when Bill was a young student filling an application form to go to Harvard, he himself must have needed a scholarship. What would he have thought if the big shots of the day, had created only scholarship funds for non-whites?</p>
<p>I really hope someone, somehow, creates scholarships for Whites (only!). Once that is achieved, if people like the SPLC start yelling, they could be told that White students (the majority, in the US) need scholarships, just like everybody else!</p>
<p>It really looks like some covert group or organisation is working real hard to turn the White majority in the US in a disposessed majority of second-class citizens.</p>

		<p>That is why I always avoid buying microsoft&rsquo;s products. For example when my free trial period of MS Office ran out, instead of paying my money to Microsoft, I downloaded OpenOffice, the free software by Sun Corp, which works much better than MSOffice. My other friend who has similar convictions bought a second hand older version of MS Office on ebay rather than pay money to Microsoft.</p>

		<p>I have also written them, suggesting they could save some print by just writing &#8220;open to everyone but White kids,&#8221; as opposed to listing every single other race as being eligible.  It&rsquo;s stuff like this that wakes White people up to the issues of reverse-discrimination faced by White youth.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; anything simply means &#8220;Whites (especially males) need not apply.  Will it ever end?</p>

		<p>From the site:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are the requirements for the American Indian/Alaska Native designation for Gates Scholar Nominees? <br>
  	<br>
American Indian/Alaska Native students will be asked to provide proof of tribal enrollment or certificate of decent from a state of federally recognized tribe if selected as a GMS candidate finalist.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;ll have to prove that they&rsquo;re not White kids trying to &#8220;pass.&#8221;  Is this what it&rsquo;s come to?<br>

		<p>Gates, in setting up his foundation to help non-white countries of the world (largely In Africa) admitted that he considered that what these countries needed to do was get their populations down. In studying the research, however, he claims he found that when a country&rsquo;s standard of living goes up, their population growth automaticlly declines. </p>
<p>So, what about Haiti, which has had aid pouring in for the better part of a century, and whose population continues to go up and up and up?</p>
<p> Bill Gates subscribes to a lot of strange, politically correct theories. He is &#8220;PC&#8221; in more than one sense of the word!</p>

When I would go to see the minority counselor, she didn&rsquo;t think I was Hispanic enough and clearly irritated that I&rsquo;d been given the scholarship.

<p>I was forced to go to these monthly student union meetings where they would talk about &#8220;The Man&#8221; and how oppressed Hispanics were and how Whites got everything. I imagine the recipients of the Gates scholarships will come out of college just like Michelle Obama, hating whites. </p>

		<p>The government watches people with money a lot closer than those with militant attitudes.  After all it is money used to by traitors and mind control operations that put the current owners in control of the government.</p>
<p>Bill Gates has done a lot for humanity, the white race included.  Back in 1992, at the G7 meeting in Houston, he was the only subject of the assembly.  The official topic was: How do we prevent another Bill Gates &hellip; as he has done more to disrupt the post war status quo than anyone else.  That same year the big newspaper in Sweden even posted an editorial by the minister of technology titled We Do Not Want a Swedish Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is the only major industrialist to have retired before 60 years of age, or even at all.  He obviously got tired of fighting the government.  He was probably threatened by the PTB into doing this scholarship deal.</p>
<p>Without Bill Gates, there would be no Am Ren web site.</p>

		<p>This racist scholarship has been in existence for some time now.

<p>Never mind that there are 44 Million White Americans who live in poverty. Of course the White poor, even though they are a larger number than the entire Black or entire Latino populations (not just their poor) are poor because of their own laziness and incompetence, while dark people are poor because of White prejudice and exploitation.</p>
<p>Just remember where Gates is when the revolution starts&hellip;</p>

		<p>The unbelievable irony to this story is, blacks have no more use for him (except for his money of course,) than we do for blacks. Having grown up in a mixed neighborhood (my family was victimized by the Urban Renewal Project back in the 1960&rsquo;,) he would have been refered to by blacks as the &#8220;typical white boy&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Rice University in Houston was founded for whites only.<br>
These explicit conditions were easily over-ruled by a judge.<br>
The argument that racial discrimination is illegal won the day.<br>
Seems like the same reasoning should apply here. But it always <br>
seems different for whites. Crazy, white liberals like Gates, <br>
Garafolo, Matthews; Olberman are unique to the white race. <br>
No other race tolerates such &#8216;race traitors&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t know why.<br>

		<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss would not have qualified for the scholarship even though he was the son of poor working-class parents. He became one of history&rsquo;s most influential mathematicians. He contributed significantly to many fields, including number theory, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, electrostatics, astronomy and optics. He is nicknamed &ldquo; the Prince of Mathematicians&rdquo;. Gauss also discovered non-Euclidean geometries but never published it. Research on these geometries led to, among other things, Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. </p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s our white-only scholarships?  If I had billions or even millions I&rsquo;d create one.  If criticism is leveled, just point out this program and other race based ones and say &#8220;I&rsquo;ll stop when they do.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I wonder why Amren does not sponsor a White only scholarship? I guess with all of the controversy over the conference I should be able to answer my own question. Instead of constantly talking about it maybe someone should start a scholarship, if nothing more than to show how racist the scholarship game is against Whites. </p>

<p>Well, no. Not so easy.  First you&rsquo;ll have to &#8220;provide proof of tribal enrollment, or a certificate of decent from a state or federally recognized tribe&#8221;.  <br>

		<p>Prior to President Bush being elected, Jesse Jackson was running around Silicon Valley shaking down corporations for not hiring enough black people. Different companies had different responses. Some companies asked for the resumes of qualified black candidates. The founder of Cypress Semiconductor had security toss Jesse Jackson and his entourage out on the street. Bill Gates was in compliance with AA laws by having a majority minority company. The minorities were white women. Microsoft had very few non-whites working for him. Microsoft was slammed with an anti-trust lawsuit which dragged on for two years. During which Hollywood produced a movie named Anti-trust starring Tim Robbins as the evil, power hungry, source code protecting, racist Bill Gates. I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s actually changed, but in the beginning it was blood money.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re parroting Microsoft propaganda.  Jupiter is right about there being a great crime behind every great fortune   &mdash;   In MSFT/Gates case, it&rsquo;s illegal monopoly tactics, and a bunch of other borderline illegal market manipulation.  However, the only good news is that most of Bill Gates&rsquo;s wealth is based on the illusory value of his MSFT stock   &mdash;   if he tried to sell it all at once, the price per share of MSFT would fall through the floor.</p>

<p>Your post is clueless. So now I am going to educate you about the real facts.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is a parasite. He had four decades of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN technology dumped into his lap. Gates is a very lucky man. He was lucky enough to be a the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>It is documented in at least one book that according to a former girlfriend of Gates, in the early days of his empire, Gates would have severe anxiety atacks at night  provoked by a fear that when he woke up in the born his incredible good luck would run out.</p>
<p>The PC is the creation of at least seven tax pater funded DARPA programs such as Lithigraphy which is crucial for the manufacture of integrated cicuit technology. A computer scientist named Leonard Cerf-one of the creators of the internet-stated in several interviews that the PC was dependent on at least seven tax payer funded DARPA prorgrams.</p>
<p>Computer Browser technolgy also came put of a tax payer funded DARPA program. Specifically, computer browser technology came out of a tax payer funded DARPA program at the University of Illinois Supercomputing Center. An undergraduate who wrote code for the Supercomputing Center&rsquo;s browser technology program had the incredibly good luck of having this tax payer funded browser technology handed over to him by the goverment. He went on to form a browser technmology program called Nerscape. The name of this undergraduate was Mark Andressen.</p>
<p>To show his deep appreciation of this gift given to him from millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN taxpayers, Mark Andressen went on to form a new company that provides Silicon Valley Tech companies with LEGAL IMMIGRANT scab labor from India and China.</p>
<p>The two parasites Bill Gates and Mark Adressen should be given a one way ticket to the Sudan&hellip;.where they can rot for a very long time.</p>
<p>Behind every great fortune is a great crime.</p>

		<p> When I first say the headline, &#8220;Gates Millennium Scholars&#8221;, I thought it was Henry Louis Gates. I should have known better. In years past it seemed like every time I saw a picture of Bill Gates he was holding a dark skinned baby. The man is a modern day robber baron, but he sure knows how to work the media. He seems to only contributes his billions to charities that give him the maximum amount of publicity He has given untold billions to the needy in Africa, and yet he appears to be unaware that he is a white American. He has been sued in European for multiple business infractions, but here in the United States he is always depicted as our leading philanthropist. </p>
