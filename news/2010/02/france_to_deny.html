<h1>France to Deny Citizenship to Man Who Forced Burka on Wife</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Nurwisah, Agence France-Presse, February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France&rsquo;s prime minister said Wednesday he would sign a decree refusing French nationality to a man who forced his wife to wear the full Islamic veil, arguing he &#8220;has no place in our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case has arisen amid a fierce national debate about what it means to be French, with the government seeking to legislate for a ban on the head-to-toe burqa on the grounds that it is incompatible with French values.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Francois Fillon told Europe 1 radio that he would sign the decree issued by Immigration Minister Eric Besson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s French law,&#8221; Mr. Fillon said. &#8220;The civil code has for a very long time provided that naturalization could be refused to someone who does not respect the values of the (French) republic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case is about a religious radical: he imposes the burqa, he imposes the separation of men and women in his own home, and he refuses to shake the hands of women.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this man does not want to change his attitude, he has no place in our country. In any case, he does not deserve French nationality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s name and nationality have not been made public, although Fillon said his wife was French and she could continue to wear the full veil, if she wants, pending legislation.</p>
<p>The decision came after a parliament report last week called for a ban on the burqa in schools, hospitals, government offices and public transport.</p>
<p>The French government is seeking legal advice before drafting legislation that would outlaw the burqa or niqab in as many areas as possible.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy has declared the burqa &#8220;not welcome&#8221; in secular France and is in favour legislation to outlaw it, though he has also warned against stigmatising Muslims.</p>
<p>According to the interior ministry, only around 1,900 women wear the burqa in France, which is home to Europe&rsquo;s biggest Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said last month that Muslim men who forced their wives to wear the full veil should not be granted citizenship.</p>
<p>Mr. Besson said Tuesday that during checks into the man&rsquo;s application, he had explicitly stated that he would never allow his wife to go out without a full veil and that he believed that a woman &#8220;is an inferior being.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two years ago a French court denied citizenship to a veiled Moroccan woman on the grounds her &#8220;radical&#8221; practice of Islam was not compatible with French values.</p>
<p>A recent survey showed 57% of French people were in favour of a law banning the burqa.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen, the deputy leader of the far-right National Front, said men who forced their wife to wear the full veil should be put on trial, convicted and expelled from the country.</p>
<p>In contrast, the leftist New Anticapitalist Party (NPA) said it was putting forward a candidate in March regional elections who wears a &#8220;light veil.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, the NPA said the woman concerned was &#8220;a militant feminist, anticapitalist and internationalist who believes she must wear the veil in accordance with her religions convictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wider debate over national identity has divided society, with critics arguing it is fomenting anti-foreigner and anti-Muslim sentiment and is little more than a grab for far-right votes ahead of the March poll.</p>
<p>Mr. Fillon said his government would hold a seminar next Monday to consider its conclusions from the debate.<br>

<p>The Muslims in France, especially in the larger cities, have been permitted by the French powers-that-be to get out of control for years now, with politicians cowtowing to their every demand. Where was this &#8220;French law&#8221; when it all started?</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s a first step.  Now, if they just could do that in several million more cases, the problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Oh, btw, and I notice that his wife is French! Very interesting. He couldn&rsquo;t find someone from back home, someone like himself?</p>

		<p>Once again, laws like this are defenses of multi-racialism,  designed to make it work, and they are aimed at the white natives, not at Muslim fundamentalists.   They are designed to ease the natives&rsquo; fear over their displacement, but not stop that displacement, to pretend that the effects of making your own people a minority in their own homeland can be controlled by words on a piece of paper.   When Muslims are even 20 or 25% of the French population they will tell France to stuff its burka ban.   As the article says,  there are only  1900 burka wearers in France,  this is a minor issue,  but it allows the crook Sarkozy to pretend to his gullible supporters that he is doing something about the mess caused by the invasion.  He is doing nothing about it because  opposing it doesn&rsquo;t advance his career, screw what happens to France.   He&rsquo;s a typical &#8220;conservative&#8221; &hellip; teaser.  </p>

		<p>France should give automatic citizenship to only those who do have full French ancestry. However if a person of French ancestry commits treason or converts to Islam, his/her citizenship should be revoked. Other White people have to show some love and understanding of French culture and the French nation and should have lived in France for at least 5 years to be granted citizenship. However if such a person commits treason or converts to Islam, his/her citizenship should be revoked. Non-Whites should be denied citizenship outright however a selected few (intelligent, non-Islamic, non-hostile, must have love and understanding of France etc&hellip;) may be given residence at best after ten years of legal residence. Those non-Whites should not make up more than 0.1% of the population ever. Finally if a citizen were to marry a non-White non-citizen, he or she should lose her citizenship and the children from these mixed marriages should be denied citizenship too. This is what France and other White nations should have done since WW2.</p>

		<p>Are we supposed to laud this single instance &#8220;courageous&#8221; stance in favor of French cultural mores, now that France&rsquo;s largest cities have been converted into North African slums? Talk about closing the barn door decades after the cows escaped&hellip;. </p>

		<p>The idea of the French enacting any sort of restricting laws on the muslims now is like the Germans of WWII protesting our invasion of Normandy&hellip;.NOT gonna happen. Remember!! mustn&rsquo;t outrage the muslims or blacks (one and the same in most cases)</p>

<p>Ironically, the word &#8220;Bulgar&#8221; is of Turkish (but some say Finno-Ugric) origin.</p>

A full veil of any kind is only present in Afghanistan and in some parts of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>France has one of two options:</p>
<p>(1) They can take the road most traveled (for the French) and surrender.  France will become The French Islamic Republic.  All non-Muslims will be forced to convert to Islam and those who refuse will be beheaded.</p>
<p>(2) Demand that ALL Muslims leave France within 90 days.  Deputize the entire French public with the edict to shoot on sight all Muslims who remain in France after the 90 day grace period.</p>
<p>It all comes down to who wants France the most; the French or the Muslims&hellip;    <br>

The present &#8216;Powers That Be&rsquo; who rule France today had no qualms about doing just that in order to get rid of the Germans, back when.  The Résistance fighters were heroes who today are commemorated.  Now, were is their Résistance movement to get rid of the the Moslems?  Oh, things are strangely quiet now. You can&rsquo;t even mention it. You&rsquo;ll land in jail if you do.</p>

		<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s seen my other posts in these forums can tell I&rsquo;m pretty liberal by American standards. So they may be surprised when I say I completely support the French in this.</p>
<p>When I worked in East Asia, I almost unwaveringly did everything within my power to conform to the expectations of that culture. Yes, I slipped up a few times from ignorance and rebelled once from choice. But when I did, I accepted the consequences. I did not try to squirm out of trouble because of my &#8220;culture.&#8221; It was their country, I was a guest in their house. As a grownup, I accepted that &#8220;eaternize my attitude or pay a price&#8221; was part of the deal. In all cases but one, I easterinized my attitude.</p>
<p>The sword cuts both ways. France has the right to require assimilation as they see fit to define it (as does Saudi Arabia, Chile, Ghana, Iceland, Canada, Mongolia, Australia and everyone else). In the United States, we don&rsquo;t ban veils because our culture calls for more religious tolerance and freedom of speech than Europe&rsquo;s traditions do. But we should certainly enforce domestic violence laws equally among those living here, regardless of their culture of origin. It&rsquo;s our house and their job is to live by our rules. We are a Western Liberal Democracy. Suck it up.</p>
