<h1>Haitian Women Become Crime Targets After Quake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paisley Dodds, Washington Post, February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bernice Chamblain keeps a machete under her frayed mattress to ward off sexual predators and one leg wrapped around a bag of rice to stop nighttime thieves from stealing her daughters&rsquo; food.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s barely slept since Haiti&rsquo;s catastrophic earthquake Jan. 12 forced her and other homeless women and children into tent camps, where they are easy targets for gangs of men.</p>
<p>Women have always had it bad in Haiti. Now things are worse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reports of attacks are increasing: Women are robbed of coupons needed to obtain food at distribution points. Others relay rumors of rape and sexual intimidation at the outdoor camps, now home to more than a half million earthquake victims.</p>
<p>A curtain of darkness drops on most of the encampments at night. Only flickering candles or the glow of cell phones provide light. Families huddle under plastic tarps because there aren&rsquo;t enough tents. With no showers and scant sanitation, men often lurk around places where women or young girls bathe out of buckets. Clusters of teenage girls sleep in the open streets while others wander the camps alone.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women who lined up for food before dawn Saturday said they were attacked by knife-wielding men who stole their coupons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aid organizations set up women-only distribution schemes because they trust the primary caregivers to get that food to extended family, not resell it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aid workers say they&rsquo;ve been staging elaborate decoy operations to draw men to one area while food coupons are given to women in another. Each of the 16 daily distributions throughout Port-au-Prince presents its own security challenges, Montouroy said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if the women successfully make it back to the camps with their 55-pound (25-kilogram) bags of rice, that doesn&rsquo;t mean their worries are over. Some camps are even providing special protection for women, with tents where they can receive trauma counseling or be alone to breast-feed and care for young children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women have long been second-class citizens in Haiti.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, the Haitian Constitution does not specifically prohibit sexual discrimination. Under Haitian law, the minimum legal age for marriage is 15 years for women and 18 years for men, and early marriage is common. A 2004 U.N. report estimated 19 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 were married, divorced or widowed.</p>
<p>Rape was only made a criminal offense in Haiti in 2005.</p>
<p>In the months after a violent uprising ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004, thousands of women were raped or sexually abused, the British medical journal Lancet reported. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} An additional threat is HIV; Haiti has the highest infection rate in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As women lined up for food at the National Palace on Saturday, U.S. soldiers kept the men behind a cordon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s discrimination!&#8221; said Thomas Louis, 40. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve all lost mothers, sisters, wives. Without women we can&rsquo;t get coupons. They&rsquo;re treating men like we are animals.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The article states that aid workers prefer to distribute food to women because they&rsquo;re more likely to share it w/their children.</p>
<p>A similar news story appeared on Amren last year dealing w/ aid workers in Africa who were stunned to find that the men receiving food were refusing to share any of it w/their own starving chidren.</p>

		<p>It is quite insensitive for the aid workers to disregard these people&rsquo;s cultural heritage. In many parts of Africa the men eat first, then the women/children eat whatever is left (if there is anything left).

		<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve just learned a valuable Anthropological lesson from this.  That the males eat first is part of the African&rsquo;s evolutionary strategy.  This behavior, ignoring the starvation of one&rsquo;s &#8216;woman&rsquo; and one&rsquo;s own offspring, accelerates the elimination, through starvation, of superfluous breeding females, and the elimination of superfluous offspring.  Not only is this why Africa was not, until recently, overpopulated, but this is why African females display such fat-storage adaptations as the Hottentot Venus effect.</p>
<p>Now we know why women on a continent without winters had to evolve such extreme storage facilities for calories. Not only could they not expect their &#8216;men&rsquo; to feed them: they could expect their &#8216;men&rsquo; to rob them of their food.  Fat storage was the only way to survive during lean times.  I presume that recent groups of offspring perished during these times&hellip;easily replaced by subsequent groups whelped out during times of plenty.  This seems cruel and extreme, except for populations incapable of long-term planning and impulse control.  For such populations, it would seem to be only natural.</p>

<p>Too bad, beggars can&rsquo;t be choosy. If they ask for US and other aid and accept it when it comes to food distribution, then they have to subscribe to OUR norms which means kids eat first.</p>

<p>Also the custom in Asia, India and the Arab countries.  The governments have done numerous studies of boy girl twin pairs to satisfy the deluded UN, US and other AID givers.  The boys at age 5 are normal size, the girls around 30 pounds, about the weight of a normal 2 year old.  Contrast that with medieval Christian Europe when as soon as a girl got married she was given lots of beer, dairy and as much meat as the family could afford to prepare her body for pregnancy.  Asian, Indian, Arab and African men deprive pregnant women of food and then wonder why the women and her breast fed babies die.</p>

<p>Is Somalia at war? no, just overt banditry and piracy which is normal for that country since recorded times. There is also order in Kuwait and Saudi because of ruthless totalitarianism which murderously crushes disidents, so we have our pick of which way to go. And I would say again, if one wants to know the conduct of blacks when international aid is delivered need only watch the opening scenes of the movie &#8220;Blackhawk Down&#8221; as this is EXACTLY how it is then and now.</p>

<p>It is true in many Arab states the oldest male gets a bigger portion of the best quality food, but in a way that makes sense since the oldest male takes on the caretaking role of all unmarried female members in adulthood (protein equates to brain power).</p>
<p>At the same time Middle Eastern Muslims have very strong family values, the father will not eat his fill while watching his children starve, the family will also not abandon children. Orphans are extremely rare as the extended families feel it is a shameful act to abandon a child and will always step up to take care of them. The Quran addresses the importance of kindness towards orphans and people feel it is their religious duty to take care of their extended family members.</p>
<p>While black nations (and some asian countries) are flooded with abandoned children Middle Eastern Muslim countries typically have very few kids in orphanages even in times of war. Before the war Iraq had something like 500 kids in orphanages and that is for a country with 25 million people.</p>

<p>And to be honest, I do not have much knowledge regarding other parts of Asia, but in East Asia, women have always received sufficient amount of nutrition and generous accommodation during their pregnancy.  Everywhere in public transportations in East Asia, there are signs that encourage everyone to yield their seats to pregnant women, handicapped people, elderly people and women with babies in their arms.  I remember, when I was a little little kid, I saw a Chinese movie on TV and saw a scene where a father was preparing a warm healthy meal for her pregnant daughter.  Considering the costumes the characters were wearing, and the house that they were living in, the plot of the movie must have taken place about two hundred years ago.  <br>

		<p>Korean Guy (#22), the Beer of Medieval Europe was ALIVE.  This was before the days of Pasteurization, and so the beverage was teeming with the microorganisms responsible for its fermentation.  These microorganisms contained and produced a wide spectrum of micronutrients: something of great value in places where there could otherwise be malnutrition, because of the unavailability of fresh produce during Europe&rsquo;s extremely long winters. </p>
<p>The benefits derived from Microbial Antagonism, when we consume foods teeming with living &#8216;good&rsquo; bacteria, are considerable.  The &#8216;good&rsquo; bacteria compete with the &#8216;bad&rsquo;, inside the body.  Again, consider being holed-up during a dark European winter, at-risk from attack by Anaerobic bacteria&hellip; Both Microbial Antagonism and Alcohol might help to fight bacteria and parasites.</p>
<p>Our family does not drink, or allow Alcohol in our homes.  So it is hard for me to say this: but even Alcohol itself is not entirely bad.  It is a destructive solvent.  But it is also a Simple Carbohydrate.  Small amounts might not be so bad.  European intelligence probably rose after pregnant mothers stopped consuming it: but by that time, there was a far better supply of food.  I would imagine that during those more difficult times, the benefits of Beer outweighed the destructive effect of its Alcohol.</p>
<p>I suppose the bottom line here, though, is that people THOUGHT they were doing something good for young married women, by giving them Beer.</p>

<p>In Medieval Europe there wasn&rsquo;t much in the way of clean water so people drank beer instead. It wasn&rsquo;t very strong, just enough alcohol to kill off the germs. Beer also has some nutritional value. </p>

<p>Beer, especially the thick, soupy  medieval sort of beer is basically bread in liquid form.  Even during the 19th century English cheap labor landowners were allowed to give their workers 2 or 3 gallons of that thick carb &amp; calorie laden beer per day rather than actual money on the grounds that a gallon of beer was as nutritious as a loaf of bread and it was.</p>
<p>Ever had Guiness?  It will fill you up as much as a meal will.</p>
<p>And Sonya.  I&rsquo;m sure you are right about the lack of orphans and foster children in Arab countries.  I am sure you are right that Arab men will go without  to feed their children.  But one can&rsquo;t argue with the Arab &amp; Muslim government health departments own statistics tha girls are significantly underweight on the average as boys due to feed the males first.</p>
<p>Of course European and Americans have often given more protein to men and boys doing hard physical labor because they need more food than those doing more sedentary work.</p>
