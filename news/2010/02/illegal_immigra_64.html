<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immig11-2010feb11,0,4502287.story?track=rss">Illegal Immigrant Numbers Plunge</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Watanabe, Los Angeles Times, February 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report that the nation&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population has declined by nearly 1 million has sharpened the debate over whether to legalize those remaining or allow their numbers to shrink through attrition.</p>
<p>The number of illegal immigrants living in the United States dropped to 10.8 million in 2009 from 11.6 million in 2008, marking the second consecutive year of decline and the sharpest decrease in at least three decades, according to a report this week by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population, still the largest in the nation, declined by 250,000 to 2.6 million. The state now accounts for just one-quarter of the nation&rsquo;s total illegal migrant population, compared with 30% in 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homeland Security department spokesman Matthew Chandler attributed the decline both to the weak economy and what he called the deployment of &#8220;unprecedented resources&#8221; in stopping illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border and throughout the country.</p>
<p>Immigration control advocates pounced on the report as evidence that illegal immigration can be reduced by restricting job opportunities and that legalization is not necessary to solve the problem. Giving a pathway to citizenship to qualified illegal immigrants has long been the most controversial element in congressional proposals for comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether jobs dry up because the government is doing enforcement or because of the recession, illegal aliens react in a rational manner: They either will not come or they&rsquo;ll go home,&#8221; said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. &#8220;It certainly shows that illegal immigration is a controllable phenomenon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates, however, argue that millions of illegal migrants have been here for years, with settled lives they will not easily disrupt to return home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. government has stepped up removal of illegal immigrants, to 387,790 in fiscal 2009 from 291,060 in 2007.</p>
<p>But Estrada said that undocumented immigrants still arrive daily at his church, seeking help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Chinese illegal immigrant population showed the steepest decline, plummeting by nearly half to 120,000 in 2009 from 220,000 the previous year, the report showed. Mexicans, who account for 62% of the undocumented population, declined by 380,000 to 6.65 million. Illegal immigrants from South Korea, the Philippines and El Salvador declined while those from Guatemala, Honduras and India increased.</p>

		<p>Yes I just finished listening to some Neocon on the radio lamenting how wonderful the people who come to this country illegally are. They just want a better life. The problem is that they are responsible partly for our current economic crisis. Poor uneducable people never make anything better. Thats why they come here. They ruined their own countries.</p>

<p>Well, just what are these &ldquo;immigrant advocates&rdquo; advocating here?</p>
<p>Is it terrorism and violence?</p>
<p>Perhaps, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security should be tracking down and correcting these &ldquo;revolutionaries,&rdquo; instead of misdirecting resources against the Minute Men and other decent Pro-American groups?</p>

		<p>An absolute testament that they only came here for the money and benefits they could siphon from the American economy. They have no desire to be American. All of their advocates only want them here for the potential future votes they or their anchor babies might one day provide. The illegals and those like them will always vote for the party or candidate who declares they are oppressed, unfortunte, underprivileged and need more benefits.</p>

		<p>Yup, it&rsquo;s true all right, that the illegals want a better life.  Who doesn&rsquo;t??  It is also true that the Mexican guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t has failed its people.  But does that produce patriots who rise to the occasion, as it did in our country during the Revolutionary War period?  Nope.  That situation just produces people who run away to somebody else&rsquo;s (OUR) country and use up OUR resources, instead of staying home and fighting to get their own country to where it serves its people.  I say there&rsquo;s a courage gene missing somewhere with those folks.  If they want to do it right, they need to take care of their own situation instead of coming here illegally to take advantage of (steal from) OUR systems.</p>

		<p>There are not 10 million illegals in the USA - that is a blatant lie that is as plain as day. </p>
<p>The number of illegals in this country is closer to 20 million, perhaps even 30. </p>
<p>This ridiculous 10M number they&rsquo;ve been citing us has gone unchanged for five years. </p>
<p>Only an imbecile or a deluded wishful thinker would believe in such obviously deflated numbers. </p>

		<p>How do they get this number 11 Million? How? On the basis of what? What documents did they fill out when they entered? Who counts them once here? When you have 7 Illegals living under one name in an apartment, as almost all of them do..then addresses<br>
mean nothing. The number or illegals in this country isnt 11 million..its 22 million or 33 million. </p>

		<p>If they are not in LA they must have come to San Diego.  I see more here all the time.   Most are very young and pregnant.  I wonder why????   I do not believe PR in NP articles. <br>
 If moratorium was effective tomorrow US still has millions of state sponsored anchor babies/children /relatives.  I suggest those who support this behavior pay for it.    Congress is arrogant to tax US citizens to pay for their negligence.  It seems like the Feds fail at everything and make US taxpayers pay for failed policies/legislation.  The pink slips need to keep coming until the house is fully cleansed.   V</p>

<p>Since the 11.6 million number is clearly false (the real number is probably 25-30 million), how can we believe that the invaders are leaving?</p>

		<p>If our inept Government can&rsquo;t keep them out they certainly can&rsquo;t  count them. I have lived in Texas and will assure you there are at least 30 million criminal invaders in our Country and they are not going anywhere. They will be here until the taxpayer freebies are gone.</p>

		<p>I doubt Theresa Watanabe lives in the same Los Angeles I do.  Here in West Los Angeles, Westwood, Cluver City, Santa Monica, the Whitest part of the metro area, it is possible to spend and entire week doing errands and not see one employee of a bank, post office, store, Drs office, hospital, library etc who is not a hispanic.  To see a non hispanic employee, one needs to go to a hairdresser, barber, stock broker, law or entertainment industry office to see White Americans, not hispanic invaders working.</p>
<p>I stopped eating in restuarants decades ago so as to boycott employers of hispanics and aliens.  But I have to eat and keep my money somewhere.  I seethe every time I go to a supermarket.<br>
For every hundred employees of a typical supermarket, 95 employees are hispanic and 5 percent blacks.  One assumes the blacks are there only to keep the EEOC away.</p>

<p>The best selling book in Mandarin, Cantonese, Fukkinese, Hakka and other common chinese languages is titled &#8220;How to get on Social Security and Disability in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get 3 50 year old Chinese with fake birth certificates stating they are 65 and each will bring in $900.00 per month, minimum social security per month.  That&rsquo;s $2,700 per month into the household of 20 people crowded into a 1,400 sq ft 3 bedroom house or apt.</p>

<p>&#8220;California&rsquo;s illegal immigrant population, still the largest in the nation, declined by 250,000 to 2.6 million.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
This reporter ought to know that every illegal-alien statistic she uses is seriously lowballed and unrealistically underestimated. </p>
<p>Only 2.6M in the state that is both the largest in overall population (37M) and also the state with what the article tells us is &#8220;still the largest illegal immigrant population&#8221; in the nation? Really? From the latest census, California&rsquo;s latinos are 36.6% of those 37M, for a total of about 13.3M latinos in CA. Of 13.3M latinos you seriously expect us to believe that almost 11M are legal and only 2.6M are fence-jumpers? Doesn&rsquo;t anybody at the LA Times own a pocket calculator? Ms. Watanabe, you probably drove past more than 2.6M illegals on your commute to work this morning! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be impressed by a voluntary repatriation of Mexicans when I&rsquo;m convinced that on any given day the number crossing the border from north to south exceeds the number crossing the border from south to north. As it is, I&rsquo;d wager that even during economic downturns, illegal immigration to the Southwest is a net increase, not a net decrease. </p>
<p>Do I have the data to back up my claims? No I don&rsquo;t. But neither does the LA Times and they&rsquo;re supposed to be a newspaper. </p>

		<p>We have a similar problems in Oz. 85% of voters reject 3rd world immigration but the politicians let them in by the boatload and the plane load. (Indonesian people smugglers, dodgy student visas and tourist visa overstayers and &#8220;skiled migrant&#8221; programs)<br>
My son is having difficulty in getting a decent job yey government instrumentalities are taking on Somalis, Shri Lankins and virtually anyone else that is non-english speaking, not white, non Christian etc.<br>
Sound familiar, not as bad as the US, fortunately we are surrounded by ocean, that does help.<br>
Perhaps the larger picture needs to be addressed also. The world is simply grossly OVERPOPULATED, AND, There will always be conflict between the haves and have-nots. It does not matter that the &#8220;haves&#8221; are there because of hard work, enterprise, the rule of law,strong military, loyalty to ones nation (and race)etc. The &#8220;have-nots&#8221; are generally black, Asian muslim etc. This, quite simply may be the next catalyst for the next major world conflict.<br>
It is tragic to see what is happening to America. I wish AmRen and like minded organisations such as the BNP every success.</p>
