			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Slack, Daily Mail (London), February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour threw open the doors to mass migration in a deliberate policy to change the social make-up of the UK, secret papers suggest.</p>
<p>A draft report from the Cabinet Office shows that ministers wanted to &#8216;maximise the contribution&rsquo; of migrants to their &#8216;social objectives&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The number of foreigners allowed in the UK increased by as much as 50 per cent in the wake of the report, written in 2000.</p>
<p>Labour has always justified immigration on economic grounds and denied it was using it to foster multiculturalism.</p>
<p>But suspicions of a secret agenda rose when Andrew Neather, a former government adviser and speech writer for Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Blunkett, said the aim of Labour&rsquo;s immigration strategy was to &#8216;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Neather said he helped to write the 2000 report which outlined a strategy to &#8216;open up the UK to mass migration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The document was not published in its original format over fears of an adverse public reaction. Instead it was released a year later as a research document on the economic benefits of migration.</p>
<p>Mr Neather&rsquo;s claims last October were denied by ministers, including Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who said they were nonsense.</p>
<p>A draft of the original Cabinet Office report has now been published following a freedom of information request by Migrationwatch.</p>
<p>It contains six references to social policy, all of which were removed from the later, published version.</p>
<p>One deleted paragraph said a framework was needed to &#8216;maximise the contribution of migration to the Government&rsquo;s social and economic objectives&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another says that migration pressures will intensify because of demographic changes across Europe but that this &#8216;should not be viewed as a negative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It states: &#8216;The entry control system is not closely related to the stated policy objectives.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is particularly true in the social area, where in the past the implicit assumption has largely been that keeping people out promotes stability.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Also cut out was a statement that &#8216;in practice, entry controls can contribute to social exclusion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Damian Green, Tory immigration spokesman, said: &#8216;This is a very significant finding because it would mean that Labour&rsquo;s biggest long term effect on British society was</p>
<p>based on a completely secret policy.</p>
<p>&#8216;This shows Labour&rsquo;s open-door immigration policy was deliberate and ministers should apologise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Neather&rsquo;s claims were made in a column for the London Evening Standard. He said Labour&rsquo;s relaxation of immigration controls was a deliberate attempt to engineer a &#8216;truly multicultural&rsquo; country and plug gaps in the jobs market.</p>
<p>He remembered &#8216;coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended  &mdash;  even if this wasn&rsquo;t its main purpose  &mdash;  to rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whitehall research shows that the number of foreigners arriving in the UK rose from 370,000 in 2001 to 510,000 in 2006.</p>
<p>The figures for net foreign immigration  &mdash;  the number of non-British citizens arriving, less the number leaving  &mdash;  are even more dramatic.</p>
<p>In 2001, this figure stood at 221,000 but by 2007 it had risen as high as 333,000  &mdash;  up 50 per cent.</p>
<p>The number fell to 250,000 in 2008 mainly because of a decline in arrivals from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It had already emerged that the Cabinet Office report was censored to remove details of possible links between immigration and organised crime, street fights and begging.</p>
<p>One of the sections missing from the final report said: &#8216;There is emerging evidence that the circumstances in which asylum seekers are living is leading to criminal offences, including fights and begging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A second section warned: &#8216;Migration has opened up new opportunities for organised crime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night, immigration minister Phil Woolas said there was &#8216;no open door policy on migration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said the draft report made clear that migration was &#8216;not a substitute for Government policies on skills, education and training of British citizens  &mdash;  which the Government has invested in over the past decade&rsquo;.</p>
<h3>S<small>idebar</small></h3>
<p><b>The Unedited Document</b></p>
<p>The highlighted text below was contained in the original draft of the document drawn up in 2000 for a discussion on immigration policy  &mdash;  but deleted from the version published in 2001.</p>
<p>1) The emerging consensus, in both the UK and the rest of the EU, is that we need a new analytical framework for thinking about migration policy if we are to maximise the contribution of migration to the Government&rsquo;s economic and social objectives.</p>
<p>2) Indeed, over the medium to longer term, migration pressures will intensify in Europe as a result of demographic changes. But this should not be viewed as a negative  &mdash;  to the extent that migration is driven by market forces, it is likely to be economically beneficial. On the other hand, trying to halt of reverse market-driven migration will be very difficult (perhaps impossible) and economically damaging.</p>
<p>3) Chapter 4, focusing on the Government&rsquo;s aim to regulate migration to the UK in the interests of social stability and economic growth, argues that it is clearly correct that the Government has both economic and social objectives for migration policy.</p>
<p>4) The more general social impact of migration is very difficult to assess. Benefits include a widening of consumer choice and significant cultural contributions. These in turn feed into wider economic benefits.</p>
<p>5) In practice, entry controls can contribute to social exclusion, and there are a number of areas where policy could further enhance migrants&rsquo; economic and social contribution in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives.</p>
<p>6) It is clear that migration policy has both social and economic impacts and should be designed to contribute to the government&rsquo;s overall objectives on both counts. The current position is a considerable advance on the previously existing situation, when the aim of immigration policy was, or appeared to be, to reduce primary immigration to the &#8216;irreducible minimum&rsquo;  &mdash;  an objective with no economic or social justification.</p>

<p>Is the &#8220;Right&#8221; in Britain (or anywhere else) really against diversity? This explanation doesn&rsquo;t make sense. It&rsquo;s true that immigrants are more likely to vote for Labour. But Labour is a center-left technocratic party, not a revolutionary socialist party with a laundry list of social objectives. If there is a secret motive for supporting mass immigration it most likely has more to do with destroying Britain&rsquo;s national sovereignty.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: Race traitors are a far greater threat to our existence than any non-white group. Race traitors, not blacks and browns, opened up Britain to mass non-white immigration. Race traitors were at the forefront of the effort to destroy the American Renaissance Conference. Race traitors, not blacks and browns, continue to enact pro-integration/pro-diversity policies. When the time comes, sleazy white elites will be held accountable for helping to destroy their own people. These limousine liberal types are our worst enemies. </p>

Now that Labour has done its nose-rubbing, why not allow the BNP, in retribution, to rub Labour&rsquo;s nose in POVERTY??  That&rsquo;s exactly what will happen AS A RESULT of Labour&rsquo;s stupid social agenda.  And they deserve what they get.</p>

		<p>The only surprising thing here is that they actually found some documents spelling out Labour&rsquo;s plans.  It is obvious that the reason the Democrats are so in favor of mass immigration and illegal immigration is that they know this will lead to a permanent Democratic majority, with continuing demands for a vast welfare state.  That so many Republicans favor the same policy is proof that they remain The Stupid Party.<br>

		<p>	Britain&rsquo;s indigenous population is suffering under the strain of multiculturalism which seems to be reserved for the lower classes; poor whites are the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values while hiding in their gated communities. <br>
	<br>
        Poor whites that are forced to live amongst foreigners are being attacked assaulted robbed and raped in disproportionate numbers; whites are often singled out as easy targets by other races because they present less resistance, you can&rsquo;t fix the problem by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist.<br>

		<p>&lsquo;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is right out of the progressive playbook.</p>
<p>The notion that if we just force the liberal changes we want upon society, thereby getting lifetime jobs for ourselves and supporters implementing and enforcing our policies, then society will eventually stop fighting against us and conceded that we won and were correct from the start.</p>
<p>This argument is used by Podesta, Axlerod, and Obama regarding the health bill.  They each said, in effect, that we must pass it now, and then people will come to value it.  No mention of those who  would be heavily taxed and disposed by it.</p>
<p>That play was even used by PETA against the live groundhog on Groundhog Day.  They claimed that a robot should be used, &#8220;and people would come to love it as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the play- we&rsquo;ll do it to you, and you&rsquo;ll eventually love us for it.  That&rsquo;s what they did to Winston Smith in 1984- tortured him until he really did love them. </p>
<p>Hitler, Stalin, Mao- they all said they were helping the people. Those who resisted were killed.</p>
<p><br>
The progressive model is forced racial integration.  Whites did not want integration in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, but now that it is enforced, respectable whites can&rsquo;t afford to complain about it, thus they appear to &#8220;value&#8221; it while their arguments against it are &#8220;outdated&#8221; and racist.</p>
<p>Integration changed America permanently. Not just the fact of it, but the process of it, and that process repeats its successes against us through liberal government thuggery.<br>

		<p>   I cannot for the life of me understand why anybody would purposely destroy their own culture and people. Liberalism surely must truly be a mental disorder. What other explanation could there be for destroying one&rsquo;s own. What sort of human being could be that mislead, misdirected, and just down right stupid? Nobody with any hint of self-respect would cut their own throat so as to make some other race of people feel equal, or welcome, or whatever the Hell it is their are trying to accomplish. Because I am a proud white man that doesn&rsquo;t buy into their insanity, I am a racist. So be it, I will wear that liberal invented word as a badge of honor. Actually, I am a racialist. One whom believes in his own self, and people.  I will fight the lib-tards with every ounce of energy of my being for the rest of my life. I will try to educate my people to the evils of lib-tards and their &#8220;diversity&#8221; propaganda. I will do my part. As the saying goes, &#8220;if not us, then whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Are they really that blind that they don&rsquo;t think that millions of immigrants might create social problems? And the economic value of the immigrants has been proven to cost the taxpayer money because they pay less tax monies than they receive.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;This shows Labour&rsquo;s open-door immigration policy was deliberate and ministers should apologise.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
Apologise? They should be put on trial.  Apologise is what you do when you&rsquo;re guilty of accidentally stepping on somebody&rsquo;s foot   &mdash;   not what you do when you wreck their nation. </p>
<p>That Labour&rsquo;s main opposition, the Conservatives, think that Labour&rsquo;s deliberate policy of race-replacement and attempts to erase 1000 years of British history, requires no more than an apology, is why the Conservatives represent no alternative to or advantage over Labour at all. </p>
<p>This is proof   &mdash;   not that any more proof should be required by this point   &mdash;   that the Tories of today are weaklings, simply not up to the task of saving Britain. Even though the Conservatives are scheduled to win the country come June, they are not what Britain NEEDS. What Britain NEEDS is the BNP. </p>

		<p>This objective was glaringly obvious from the beginning of Blair&rsquo;s premiership.Having set the wheels in motion for the independence of Scotland and Wales,Labour knew that it would need to import a new electorate into England once the Celtic nations finally left the United Kingdom.Labour would have been ousted two elections ago without the votes of the Scots and the Welsh,who even now may hold the balance in the coming election.The full legacy of Labour&rsquo;s immigration nightmare will come to pass in five or ten years from now,when all of its third-world foot soldiers have achieved citizenship and the minority English population will be outvoted.</p>

		<p>#17, great points. Why? I mean, isn&rsquo;t that a little extreme? Well, look at the numerous murders, beatings, and social problems that followed mass non-white immigration to Britain and the rest of Europe. Labour has done more damage to Britain than any mass murderer could ever hope to replicate. </p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t buy the nonsense about how &#8220;anyone can be a Britain,&#8221; and how &#8220;it&rsquo;s all in the language and culture.&#8221; Let me ask them something: Could a black &#8220;Scotsman&#8221; play William Wallace in a film? Could a brown Muslim woman play Queen Elizabeth? Could a Pakistani man play George Darwin? Similarly, can a non-Asian man star as a Japanese/Chinese/Korean historical film? If you can&rsquo;t answer yes to any of those questions, then blacks/other non-whites cannot be British. Non-Asians cannot be Japanese/Chinese/etc. Non-black Africans cannot go into Africa and expect to become tribal royalty (speaking of which, one uberliberal British activist lamented the fact that British Royalty had no non-whites. I believe his name is Peter Tatchell). </p>
<p>Therefore, even if they speak the language and know the culture, non-whites can never truly be European, just as non-Asians can never be Asian, non-Africans African, etc. Britain needs the BNP, and not black American afrocentrists like Bonnie Greer who have the audacity to tell whites like Nick Griffin that they aren&rsquo;t the true natives of Britain.</p>

		<p>In fact, a solemn promise of &#8220;There will be no further widescale immigration into Britain&#8221; was given in the manifestoes of both Labour and Conservative parties after 1971 - when immigration was a very hot-button issue after the Powell speeches.<br>
