			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Barrett, London Telegraph, February 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A little-known rule, introduced by Labour in 2003, allows illegal immigrants to claim &#8220;indefinite leave to remain&#8221; if they manage to live in Britain&rsquo;s black economy for long enough or are failed asylum seekers who manage to avoid deportation.</p>
<p>After 14 years they can apply to the Home Office which considers factors such as &#8220;compassionate circumstances, strength of connection to the UK and previous criminal record&#8221;, before deciding whether an illegal immigrant will be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>If successful, the immigrant will then be allowed full access to the welfare state and be eligible to apply for a British passport.</p>
<p>Since rules changed in April 2003, 7,245 illegals have won the right to live here permanently  &mdash;  more than 1,000 a year on average. It is likely that many paid no income tax during the 14 years they spent in Britain.</p>
<p>The Home Office estimated in 2005 that the illegal immigrant population in Britain was between 310,000 and 570,000 but other groups such as Migrationwatch UK, which campaigns against mass immigration, have put the figure far higher.</p>
<p>Migrationwatch UK now believes the true number of illegal immigrants could be as high as one million.</p>
<p>Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, said: &#8220;What disturbs me most is how many more people will be able to establish this type of squatters&rsquo; rights to stay in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rewarding illegal behaviour is always bad, and there ought to be a lot more effort put into stopping people getting to this 14 year level.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons why we want to set up a specialist border police force is to prevent people being able to stay here for many years entirely below the radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migrationwatch, said: &#8220;It is wrong in principle that people who have been undercutting British workers for many years and often paying no tax should be granted full access to our welfare state.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a reward for crime, provided you get away with it for long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>One immigration law adviser, who declined to be named, said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m surprised this rule still survives, to be honest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an anomaly when compared with the rest of the Government&rsquo;s policy which purports to be getting tough with immigrants who have irregular status.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rules allowing illegal immigrants to claim residence after 14 years were formalised by the Home Office in 2003 but previously existed as a loose concession.</p>
<p>The arrangements mirror the legal status of &#8220;squatters&rsquo; rights&#8221;, formally known as adverse possession, in English and Welsh law.</p>
<p>These rules say that anyone who has occupied land or property for 12 years can apply to be registered as owner.</p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;Not all applications for indefinite leave to remain through the long residence rule will be granted.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the strength of connection to the UK, previous criminal record and compassionate circumstances, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it was expected that the number of people granted indefinite leave to remain under the rule would fall as asylum claims were dealt with more quickly.</p>
<p>Keith Best, an immigration expert and former chairman of the Immigration Advisory Service, said: &#8220;This is a sensible and flexible system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes account of individual circumstances, particularly when somebody may have been an overstayer in this country and has not always committed a deliberate act of trying to evade the authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 14 years which illegal immigrants have to wait before claiming indefinite leave to remain in Britain is only four years longer than the period of time required of lawful immigrants.</p>
<p>Those who stay here on a visa or who are granted refugee status only have to wait 10 years before applying for the same concession, if they have been continuously resident in Britain.<br>

<p>Too bad these multicults aren&rsquo;t going to have enough money to feed them when the UK follows Greece into bankruptcy later this year or the first part of the next.</p>
<p>I wonder if they&rsquo;ll have street riots and strikes, just as Greece is having right now and will soon accelerate?</p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t all have to be illegal. Our doomed communist scottish dominated government have, over the entire period of their fetid rule, swamped England with immigrants. Many of these are truly alien, no matter how anyone pleads otherwise, being of a violent anti-Christian people from half the world away with absolutely no knowledge of our customs and way of life, language, food, lifestyle, housing, family values, education, transport, electoral system, medical facilities, freedom of expression, and so on ad infinitum. A truly deliberate treasonable act to destroy this country. Please scroll to the top of this link and read the news article prior to reviewing the comments.<br>

		<p>AMERICA - BE WARNED, DON&rsquo;T LET YOUR SOCIALISTS RUIN YOUR COUNTRY LIKE OUR SOCIALISTS HAVE OURS</p>
<p>The above article would be depressing news for us mild mannered, tolerant, abused and crowded-out Brits, except that we&rsquo;ve seen more and worse, loony immigration rules in the last 13 years here in Britain.</p>
<p>This is just the latest &#8220;trick&#8221; by the British &#8216;New Labour&rsquo; government to show their hatred towards the British white people, towards the non-white middle and working classes and to anyone who used to enjoy life here.</p>
<p>They have deliberately pursued a policy of forcing huge levels of immigration into this, already overcrowded country, in fact it was the most crowded nation in Europe even before New Labour got into power. </p>
<p>This immigration policy was recently proven to be a cynical stratagem to get more New Labour voters and to spoil Britain for the existing, loyal, law-abiding residents (of any race).</p>
<p>The result of this 13 years of massive ethnic replacement project is:</p>
<p>   - More crime from the moslem heroin gangs and <br>
     also form their junkies</p>
<p>   - More demands on the taxpayer to fund welfare for the <br>
     immigrants such as huge houses, because their families <br>
     are much larger than those of the existing residents </p>
<p>   - Less access to public services like transport, housing <br>
     and healthcare because of huge demand.  Also these are<br>
     now more expensive if you want reasonable levels of <br>
     quality. <br>
     <br>
     If you can&rsquo;t afford these, then you are condemned to <br>
     live in a crime ridden ghetto that used to be a <br>
     civilised middle class area 15 years ago (I know, I&rsquo;ve <br>
     been forced to move)<br>
  <br>
   - Education standards plummeting because schools have to <br>
     employ assistants for the millions of foreign-speaking <br>
     children and also cannot refuse employment to a foreign <br>
     teacher with no grasp of English.<br>
   <br>
   - Dumbed down media and culture in general.  The BBC used to <br>
     show a mixture of populist entertainment, high culture, <br>
     illuminating documentaries and programs that showed an <br>
     independent point-of-view.  <br>
     <br>
     Now, apart from very rare flashes of brilliance, it is <br>
     wall-to-wall left wing propaganda or trailer-trash TV, where <br>
     any mention of Britain before 1970 is frowned upon and no <br>
     television programme must contain an all-white cast.<br>
     <br>
     In fact, American readers may be surprised to know that my <br>
     children learn more about British history and culture from <br>
     watching various &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221; episodes than they do from <br>
     our home-grown British TV!<br>
     <br>
    <br>
Britain&rsquo;s socialist government has been in power for 13 years and its members include all of the usual left wing bigots:<br>
 <br>
  Revolutionary marxists (who persuaded our MI5 to shred their security files)<br>
  Indoctrinated sons and grandsons of revolutionary marxists <br>
  Men-hating militant feminists<br>
  English-hating Scottish socialists<br>
  White-hating Indian and Pakistani bigots</p>
<p>Of course I would like to point out that there are some decent men, women and Asian politicians in New Labour but they are a minority. </p>
<p>Sadly decent and rational people are also a minority in our opposition political party, the Conservatives. They were once a sensible party who promoted policies that favoured the individual over the state and helped businesses, workers and families in general.  Sadly they have fallen for the usual politically correct brain-bleaching drivel that comes out of the many socialist institutions here, like the BBC and most of the Press.</p>
<p>A recent poll shows that a majority of British-born people want to emigrate because of the damage done by New labour. Now, WE are the real political refugees.</p>

		<p>ALL, once White nations, have succumbed to this insanity of allowing nonwhite immigration into their lands. Have they never heard of the &#8220;barbarians inside the gates&#8221;? </p>

		<p> Doesn&rsquo;t it seem like some of these &#8220;squatters&#8221; turn out to be radical mullahs or Islamists. Isn&rsquo;t it only a matter of time before they launch another attack in Londonistan? England doesn&rsquo;t appear very merry these days.</p>

		<p>Just suppose you are a somali with kids by a Danish husband named yusef. Lets suppose he refuses to work and support his family in UK. Well, he could just up and leave, after all, the stupid English will feed and house his family because the EU says so. This is not the basis for a new TV sit-com story, it&rsquo;s true.<br>

<p>I used to work with a bloke from England (I&rsquo;m from Down Under) who brought his family out here and told me one morning in a hushed tone the reason why&hellip;multiculturalism. Not that bad here at the moment people, but give it time&hellip;</p>
<p>What amuses me (I&rsquo;ll use that term lightly with a heavy dose of sarcasm) is all these people wasting their time, your time and not to mention your tax $$$ pleading the cases of useless people on behalf of silly &#8216;advocacy and rights groups&rsquo; that shouldn&rsquo;t even be here!!! <br>
Hasn&rsquo;t &#8220;Keith Best, an immigration expert and former chairman of the Immigration Advisory Service&#8221; got something more worthwhile to do for Britain? Maybe he could learn how to play the bloody piano or how to cook? Or better still, do something for your OWN people eh?</p>
