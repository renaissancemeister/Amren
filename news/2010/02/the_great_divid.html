			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Carmichael, Newsweek, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the years since the report [Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, an Institute of Medicine report], the issue has gotten plenty of publicity, more reports have come out, and several agencies  &mdash;  including the National Center on Minority Health  &mdash;  have examined the problem and suggested solutions. Still, studies continue to turn up disturbing disparities. For instance, earlier this month, a paper from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found that between 1992 and 2004, black women were up to 90 percent more likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer than white women, even though rates of mammogram screening were similar for the two groups. Another recent study put the health data in financial terms and found that race-related differences in health care cost the country $229 billion between 2003 and 2006, a result that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called &#8220;just stunning and shocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>So why, now that everyone&rsquo;s aware of the problem, do we still have one? Mostly, the reason is that health and race are both complicated issues to examine academically. {snip}</p>
<p>Take the simple issue of how to classify people in order to study health disparities. Let&rsquo;s say you want to look at Hispanics. &#8220;They&rsquo;re a group that is linked only by being from countries that were under Spanish rule,&#8221; says Thomas A. LaVeist, director of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. &#8220;To combine Cubans and Mexicans and everyone else into one category doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. The populations are so different. You have a tremendous amount of variation [in health, lifestyle, and genetic heritage] that&rsquo;s being masked.&#8221; Or take the fact that studies often put Africans living in the U.S. in the same category as African-Americans who were born and raised here. If you want to study, say, HIV rates, that catchall category becomes meaningless, says LaVeist, because the virus is so much more prevalent in Africa.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the thorny issue of causation. Almost all common health problems have two root causes: the &#8220;nature&#8221; ones (i.e., genetic factors), and the &#8220;nurture&#8221; ones, which come from one&rsquo;s environment. For minority health issues, both categories are complicated. Race is a notoriously inaccurate proxy for genetics, since it&rsquo;s such an imprecise way of describing people. Take the case of Bidil, the so-called black heart-disease drug. {snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;nurture&#8221; category is even more complicated, because it encompasses both the social environment (how people live, their income, what they eat, how stressed-out they are) and the medical environment (whether doctors are treating them differently because of their race). {snip}</p>
<p>Take diabetes, which is far more common in African-Americans and Hispanics than in whites. Both Sequist and LaVeist have looked at the issue extensively. Sequist&rsquo;s work has found that &#8220;the health system in general got much better for diabetes care&#8221; for minorities from 1999 to 2003, thanks to &#8220;cultural competency&#8221; training for doctors. In one study, physicians were treating patients of different races exactly the same way by the end of the training. But the minority patients&rsquo; outcomes actually got a little worse over the same time period. Similarly, LaVeist has looked at &#8220;a community with black and white people living together, in the same conditions&#8221;  &mdash;  specifically, a neighborhood in southwest Baltimore  &mdash;  and found that &#8220;there was no race difference with diabetes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All these complications make it extremely difficult to implement good policies around race and health. And yet, says Sequist, &#8220;about three or four years ago, there was a huge push to move into the phase of actually doing something about this.&#8221; Cultural competency training has now become standard in many medical centers. {snip}</p>
<p>But health-care reform probably won&rsquo;t be enough to change the fact that minorities are more likely to be in poor health. {snip}<br>

		<p>Newsweek is a white journal writing to whites who want to be told how to speak about race in order to remain respectable in white elite society.   Blaming whites for all afrovoodoo race problems is the core mantra.</p>
<p>These Newsweek reading whites should never be allowed to marry whites, live in white neighborhoods, pray in white churches and segregated synagogues, send their white children to white private schools, join white private clubs, work for white bosses, allow their white daughters to marry white men, for starters.</p>

		<p>Just think, if we didn&rsquo;t have diversity we wouldn&rsquo;t have to spend any money at all on cultural competency training.  By Newsweek&rsquo;s own admission diversity cost our health care system $229 billion between 2003 and 2006.</p>
<p>Now for the multicultis who like to lurk at this forum, please enumerate $229 billion of <i>benefits</i> that diversity brought to this country between 2003 and 2006.</p>

		<p> I can&rsquo;t comment on alleged disparities in health care between blacks and whites (though I doubt that they exist to any significant degree), but given their promiscuity, personal habits, their frequency of IV drug use, personal hygiene, reckless lifestyles, excessive alcohol use, and haphazard nutritional habits, the higher incidence of all sorts of diseases, pathologies, and personal injuries among blacks should not be surprising.</p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t &#8220;complicated&#8221; at all.  It&rsquo;s very simple and obvious.  What&rsquo;s &#8220;complicated&#8221; is the tortuous and convoluted attempts to deny the obvious.<br>

		<p>Here is a medical disparity that must be remedied immediately.</p>
<p>Of heart transplants in the U.S., about fifty [50 %] go to blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks comprise about 13 % of the U.S. population AT MOST and yet get 50 % of the heart transplants.</p>
<p>The perception is that whitey ALWAYS benefits when it comes to disparity in health care. NOT SO!</p>

		<p>Most of the so-called health disparity can be attributed to life style and the practice of destructive habits.</p>
<p>Blacks drink, smoke, use drugs, use violence, bad diet, poor mental attitude, etc.</p>
<p>Their poor health is due not so much to lack of care and is more due to the way they live.</p>
<p>NOT seeking care when sick until it is too late is another reason for the &#8220;disparity&#8221;. NOT the doing of evil whitey.</p>

<p>I really think the day is coming when whites will have their own country in North America, or perhaps their own reservation. Someone really needs to be keeping track of these really aggrevous diversity mongers in high places, or in Academia. Many times they are proud of their work and proclaim themselves on lists. It&rsquo;s not about justice. I don&rsquo;t necessarily think they should be kept in mind for prosecution - I don&rsquo;t say it to intimidate anyone or modify anyone&rsquo;s opinion. I simply don&rsquo;t want them in my country. And after all, they really do love diversity&hellip;  </p>

<p>Blacks didn&rsquo;t invent any of those habits or problems.  All humans throughout history have similar &#8220;issues&#8221;, in every nation.  Maybe you, Jeddermann, have some similar problems to those you&rsquo;ve listed.  Maybe not.</p>
<p>To me, this is an excuse for the poorness in every way of blacks worldwide.  &#8220;If they&rsquo;d just stop drinking, smoking, using drugs, being violent, eating crummy foods, and develop better mental attitudes, why they&rsquo;d be just fine!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I stopped reading (AND BUYING) Newsweek and other p.c. magazines years ago. I mean why PAY to have the politically correct nonsense shoved at me? </p>
<p>I stopped buying movie tickets for us also years ago. Given the garbage purveyed by the Hollywood Propaganda Factory. The main characters saddled with their obligatory Black &#8220;best friends.&#8221; Blacks invariably portrayed by the Propaganda Factory as smarter, braver, better people than the White actors.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t patronize the video rentals either for the same reason. Because I absolutely REFUSE to subsidize Hollywood&rsquo;s Propaganda Factory with my money. I urge all intelligent people to follow suit. If I want to read an article; I&rsquo;ll scan it at the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore newstand. That way I don&rsquo;t support the obnoxious magazines in the least.</p>

<p>Sure, blacks didn&rsquo;t invent those things, but how is that even relevant? Those are some of the main reasons for poor black health. People keep finding ways to blame whites for the unhealthful habits of blacks. An example is the propagation by academia and the media of the concept that poor blacks can&rsquo;t eat well because the stores in their neighborhoods don&rsquo;t sell healthful food. Recent studies have shown that these groups still eat the same way even when offered more healthful alternatives, yet you still hear the idea expounded by ignorant, self-hating whites without any proof to back it up. Collectively, blacks love over-sweetened,fried and processed food more than any other group.</p>
