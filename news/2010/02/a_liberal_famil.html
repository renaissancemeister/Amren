		<p>Honestly, some really great stuff here; a big round of applause for Mr. Rawthorne, are in order!</p>
<p>I am not going to rehash some of my favorite samples from the original website, but only going to praise his ingenuity in linking the vanguard perniciousness of: 60s countercultural freakdom, current multiculturalism, and ossified degenerative Marxism, in this country. Of course, his notable mocking of how it has all brought Islam (our longstanding mortal outside enemy) into being the only tolerated &ldquo;religion,&rdquo; is worth mentioning. </p>
<p>Indeed Jayson: &ldquo;Yes I see the church. What I don&rsquo;t see is a mosque&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall, it is echoing what I have always believed; half of winning this war for our civilization, depends on obtaining laughs and not just truthful eloquence or hardball politics!</p>

		<p>Currently in our society, one must be constantly on guard to monitor one&rsquo;s behavior and thoughts to suppress any action or words that might be construed as racist.  This is very similar to the situation during both Stalin&rsquo;s and Mao&rsquo;s reigns, when a complaint or a counter-revolutionary thought could get you tortured and killed. People lived in constant fear, and you never knew who might report you   &mdash;   it could be your children or best friend. </p>
<p>This sort of &#8220;walking on eggshells&#8221; sucks resources and is a drain on our economy.  Imagine if we lived in a racially homogeneous society, where 100% of the employees were productive.  Instead, every large corporation and university in America today has 97 productive employees and 3 employees in the &#8220;Office of Minority Concerns.&#8221;  Those 3 people do not produce anything   &mdash;   they simply monitor the actions of the others, and otherwise interfers in efficiency.  This helps to lower America&rsquo;s competitiveness.<br>

		<p> Mr. Zawthorne&rsquo;s wit is wicked. Notice how the kids in most frames look like the sane ones, and the parents the overaged &rsquo;60s radicals whackos. I especially liked the one about wanting the kids at summer camp &#8220;exposed to a gay counselor&#8221;!</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t think liberals think the way those cartoons portray.  The things they say are merely window dressing for their claim to moral superiority.  They just want other people to think that way.  If it wasn&rsquo;t so they wouldn&rsquo;t be going to great pains to put their children in private schools, would they?</p>

		<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t much care for &#8216;Liberals&rsquo; OR &#8216;Conservatives&rsquo;, since they tend to be on-board with either the Democrats&rsquo; plan for destroying America, or the Republicans&rsquo; plan for destroying America.  We in the middle want none of either.</p>

		<p>To be honest, these cartoons aren&rsquo;t that funny. I have known white liberals who embody such stereotypes to at least some degree. At the same time, I haven&rsquo;t met any white liberal THAT crazy! I don&rsquo;t know of Zack Rawthorne&rsquo;s intentions, but I guess he is just using extreme caricatures to prove a point about white liberals. While some of the strips are insightful, it just isn&rsquo;t that funny. Besides, what is he revealing to us about white liberals that we don&rsquo;t already know? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, many white liberals do embody such negative traits to a certain degree, yet the delivery and dialogue of Rawthorne needs work.</p>

<p>The actor you probably read about was Charlie Sheen son of actor Martin Sheen:Sheen and is wife went through a hippie phase where they both walked around the house with no clothing on. Sheen has publicly spoken about this.</p>
<p>The vast majority of white liberals live in Lilly White communities. The Clintons-Bill and Hillary-live in the very wealthy lilly white community of Chappaqua NY. </p>

		<p>As we&rsquo;ve pointed out many times, there&rsquo;s always somebody around to scream that the racial sky is falling, and the humdrum MSM will pick it up and go with it, claiming there&rsquo;s a &#8220;controversy&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s a commercial for Rx glasses where a woman, gowned for bed, unwittingly lets in a coon, thinking it&rsquo;s her cat, with which she will &#8220;snuggle&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m surprised someone like Michael Eric Dyson hasn&rsquo;t appeared on TV to claim the ad is racist, hinting at white women who can&rsquo;t &#8220;see&#8221; letting black men into their houses and getting raped!  </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, if Mr. Rawthorn had published these cartoons in Europe, he would be under arrest for incitement of hatred, and if he had done it in Holland or Denmark, he would have been shot or stabbed by a crazy &#8220;immigrant&#8221;, which seems to be semantically equal there to &#8220;colonist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Very funny stuff, thanks for sharing this discovery with us, even though it&rsquo;s not a typical AmRen item. </p>
<p>The cartoonist&rsquo;s decision to superimpose super-PC 21st Century cliches upon drawings of early-1960s suburbia   &mdash;   i.e. just BEFORE all this nonsense started taking hold   &mdash;   is a stroke of brilliance. The artwork reminds me of old MAD Magazines from my childhood, and so does the quality of the humor (those are compliments, BTW). </p>
<p>If the Left can have 40 years of Doonesbury, then we on the Right should be entitled to a daily dose of Diversity Lane. </p>

		<p>To ghw, regarding: &ldquo;Yes, the most effective, most devastating weapon can be laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed it is, particularly when what the individual or group is proposing is so easy to target as are these Multi Cultists. Most fools with a childishly utopian or totalitarian mindset, just can&rsquo;t stand to be laughed at; this is because they are proposing the ridiculous as reality. They hope most people are stupid enough to believe their absurdities, but when you mock them it only reinforces what they already know deep down. That they are even bigger jokes than what they are proposing to be the &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the best to you ghw,</p>

<p>I know what you mean.  Today, children are taught that the 1950&rsquo;s were America&rsquo;s worst decade because whites were racists, blacks suffered under segregation, women had no opportunities, business didn&rsquo;t care about the environment, and religion suffocated us all.  </p>
<p>Some day, children will be taught that the 2010&rsquo;s were America&rsquo;s worst decade because whites hated themselves, minorities were pampered, women rejected motherhood, business was shackled by regulation and all everyone cared about was their own personal happiness. </p>
