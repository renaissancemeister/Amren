			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Slevin, Washington Post, February 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Henry Bonilla, a Texas Republican whose district ran along the Mexican border, won seven straight elections to the House by relying on retail politics in Hispanic communities where GOP candidates had rarely bothered to tread.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&rsquo;t go out and bring more Hispanics to our party, the math isn&rsquo;t there to win, no matter what the other side does,&#8221; said Bonilla, who has argued the case in one-on-one meetings with Republican leaders in Congress. &#8220;If they&rsquo;re too blind to recognize that, it&rsquo;s their own selves doing them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonilla should know. He lost in 2006 to another Hispanic candidate, a Democrat.</p>
<p>The Hispanic population is expected to increase by nearly 200 percent by 2050, with non-Hispanic whites accounting for about half the U.S. population, down from 69.4 percent in 2000. From 1988 to 2008, the number of eligible Hispanic voters rose 21 percent  &mdash;  from 16.1 million to 19.5 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers don&rsquo;t lie,&#8221; said Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant. &#8220;If Republicans don&rsquo;t do better among Hispanics, we&rsquo;re not going to be talking about how to get Florida back in the Republican column, we&rsquo;re going to be talking about how not to lose Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fewer Hispanics view the Democratic Party favorably than did a year ago, according to NBC-Wall Street Journal polls, when they had recently voted in record numbers for Barack Obama. But by many measures, including candidate recruitment and vote totals, Republicans continue to struggle. The most vexing problem is the immigration debate, in which hard-liners and &#8220;tea party&#8221; activists have alienated many Hispanics with their harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Michael] Steele, the GOP&rsquo;s first African American chairman, wants to broaden the party&rsquo;s appeal. His approach centers on reaching Hispanics in more places, with what one aide called &#8220;real integration.&#8221; Steele banned the word &#8220;outreach&#8221; from his staff&rsquo;s lexicon, saying it indicates that Hispanics and other minorities are not considered integral party members. {snip}</p>
<p><b>The Bush model</b></p>
<p>Roughly 2 million more Hispanics cast ballots in the 2008 presidential race than said they did four years earlier, according to an analysis of Census Bureau survey data by the Pew Research Center. The percentage of total votes that were cast by Hispanics doubled to 7.4 percent between 1988 and 2008, the center said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bonilla, now a consultant dividing his time between Texas and Washington, said he has urged Republican leaders in Congress &#8220;not to forget&#8221; Hispanics: &#8220;Sometimes I&rsquo;m concerned that there&rsquo;s not more action. They&rsquo;re absolutely in agreement, but once the next day begins, they&rsquo;re distracted by bailouts and health care and cap-and-trade.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Why GOP is falling short</b></p>
<p>Luis Saenz managed the 2006 reelection campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) in 2006. He sees increasing inclusiveness among some GOP politicians, but he perceives &#8220;too much patronizing.&#8221; His counsel is grounded in fundamentals: &#8220;The efforts have to be constant, not just election year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The beginning of GOP success, Saenz said, is the answer to a riddle: &#8220;How do you get voters to say, &#8216;This party looks like me&rsquo;? The Democratic Party has done a really good job of bringing everybody in. The Republican Party has to do a better job.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When pressed on the status of GOP efforts to find more of those faces, spokeswoman Angela Sailor said the party&rsquo;s political and coalitions divisions are working with state parties &#8220;to recruit Hispanic candidates with an emphasis on local candidates.&#8221; Yet at the winter RNC meeting in Honolulu last month, how to attract Hispanic voters and candidates was not on the agenda.</p>
<p>Dan Bartlett, who advised Bush in Texas and Washington, said Republicans need to recruit well and build &#8220;an authentic relationship&#8221; with Hispanics. &#8220;The Hispanics are going to be a dominant political force in the state of Texas and around the country for the next 100 years, and the Republican Party&rsquo;s blowing it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a real dearth of smart thinking on the Republican side of the aisle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the immigration issue, Hispanics were alienated by Republicans pushing for English-only policies and stringent law enforcement while opposing paths to legal residency and citizenship. Bonilla said it was a moment when &#8220;all of this came crashing backward.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steele said the vitriol on immigration &#8220;harkens back, quite frankly, to the Southern strategy that the Republicans embraced in the 1960s, causing black Republicans to abandon the party.&#8221; {snip}</p>

<p>I question just how long blacks, latinos, gays and white-liberals will coexits under the same tent in the Democrat party.  I don&rsquo;t think it will last long at all.  Maybe one more election cycle, but after that, their tenuous &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221; will desolve into bickering racial squabbles.  The Republicans are too stupid to see that they could win every election for the next 50 years if they actually became the &#8220;white party&#8221; that leftists say they are.  </p>

		<p>The Democrat Party will be minority majority before this decade is over so I think the best strategy for the Republicans is to not act as a pressure valve for them by keeping minorities out.  The Democrat Party has been bleeding White voters for years and will continue to do so as the minorities edge them out of power.  All this talk about Republicans not having the numbers to win elections is nonsense.  The White electorate is still about 75 percent of the overall vote and lots of people didn&rsquo;t bother to vote in the last election.  The Republicans need to reach out with the right message.  Abandoning the Middle East wars, dismantling this huge expensive empire that we can no longer afford nor is necessary along with a populist platform that puts America first, coupled with strong socially conservative values will even draw crowds from the Democrat Party.  I think alot of people are starting to understand when they voted for Ron Paul in the CPAC straw poll he won a few days ago.  We can&rsquo;t afford anymore of the elite&rsquo;s sock puppets with their rehearsed lines about being proud to be an American while wearing the flag pin of a foreign country, spewing their bile about free trade, globalism and &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Henry Bonilla sold his country out to Mexicans for seven elections, but they still dumped him for a Democrat.  And he&rsquo;s dumb enough to think that the answer is to pander even more.  What can the GOP possibly offer to a constituency whose primary interests are more welfare and open borders?  </p>

		<p>This article just enrages me. They don&rsquo;t even blink an eye to the fact that Hispanics will be the &#8220;dominant political force&#8221; in AMERICA. Why even bother with the white vote at all? Since we are fast becoming the minority in our own country, they had better start catering to the people they have allowed to flood our nation if they want to keep their power, and that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s about really. I look forward to the day THEY become a minority in the GOP and are replaced with their Hispanic counterparts.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics will dominate for the next 100 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently,Mr. Bartlett fancies himself as some kind of seer? Does he have a crystal ball as to what this nation is going to be like in one-hunderd years, or who will &#8220;dominate&#8221; it. I have an interesting book that is filled with predictions about the future and it was published some 62 years ago. Without exception, every prediction was wrong. I have another book that claims to be a study of the future. It was written in 1978. Nothing described in it as to what the next thirty years would be like came to pass. The study of the future and predictions about the future have always proven to be essentially a waste of time. Life, where human beings are concerned,is too complex and too irrational. Things are often transformed so radically, and so quickly, that almost everyone ends up taken by surprise.</p>
<p>I remember when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, and I remember a radio talk show host, predicting a few years before it happened, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be less than another hundred years before Germany might be reunited. Even after reunification, no one imagined the complex problems that would arise for the n ew Germany, this inspite of th fact that both East and West Germany contained people that spoke the same language, had relatives on opposite sides of the border and so on. Did anyone in 1995, imagine that General Motors Corporation, the biggest auto and truck producer in the world would go totally bankrupt. Did anyone imagine, that the U.S. would be in its present state, just say, 15 years ago?</p>

		<p>If the Republican party wants to be really forward looking it should recruit more New Guineans. There aren&rsquo;t many now but when they start arriving in large numbers the Republicans will have a head start. The GOP wouldn&rsquo;t want to be caught playing catch-up would it? </p>

		<p>Every day white American animosity towards Balkanizing Hispanics grows by leaps and bounds.  </p>
<p>Hispanics will never consider themselves to be Americans.</p>
<p>Just as Mestizos are considered to be the dregs of Hispanic cultures Hispanics are considered to be the dregs of American culture.</p>
<p>Long before white Americans allow Hispanics to dominate American politics Hispanics will be forcefully excised from our society via a total civil war&hellip;    </p>

		<p>Poster 6- Sarge. You are right. It is lunacy but they want to re-create the constitution based on their own agendas. Bush was an &#8220;expert&#8221; (it&rsquo;s difficult for me to say that because he was too dumb to spell his middle initial) at pandering to Hispanics. He was too dumb to even hide the truth. He said that we, as Americans, need to help these people come out from &#8220;the shadows&#8221; that they are living in. These people, meaning ILLEGAL aliens. Bush was a joke, and Obama will just carry that joke til the punchline is lost on White Americans. They are not in charge anymore. Presidents are pawns for the Mulitculti elites and Corporations to play with. The Constitution as we know it will be unrecognizable in 20 years. </p>

		<p>Certain constituencies will remain loyal to particular parties, at least for the foreseeable future.  Blacks and gays, for instance, will remain Democratic.  White people, as a whole, still make up the vast majority of people and voters in the U.S. and can turn a national election any way they want.  The problem is that at least 1/2 do not vote!</p>

		<p>This article makes me sick. Why sould we have to cater to everyone else? How about we just start deporting them and we won&rsquo;t have to worry about their vote. Soon enough our country will look like the ones that they came from. A white person being in any office will be a thing of the past once we are overrun with the illegals and continue to cater to them. </p>

		<p>A vote for the Republican party is a vote for the death of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICA. This has been manifestly obvious since the election of Richard Nixon in 1969. I will not vote for the death of the racial group I belong to. By the way, A vote for Ron Paul is a vote for the death of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN also. I am just waiting for the Ron Paul supporters here to engage me in a debate over this obvious fact.</p>

		<p>If Republicans become the &#8220;party in charge&#8221;, what does this actually mean to so many European Amerians. I ask this question because so many posters seem to be concerned about Republicans regaining influence. When they have this influence, how will it translate to helping European Americans, that are now denied so many things because of affirmative action, quotas, and race based initiatives of all kinds that favor &#8220;protected groups&#8221;. In other words, what difference will it make to most European Americans if the Republican machine regains power, but the legally mandated prejudice against European Americans continues to exist. Does anyone on this forum really believe the Republican club is going to challenge any of it. If you do, I want to sell you some ocean front property in the desert&hellip;etc.</p>

		<p>Note to #7:<br>
I have had similar thoughts when reviewing past predictions of &#8220;America&rsquo;s Future&#8221;. In the 1950&rsquo;s, I remember a prediction of a manned lunar landing in the 1990&rsquo;s (generally considered impossible or highly unlikely), and one about helicopters supplementing cars for personal transportation. </p>
<p>A strange idea occurred to me: Suppose a book was written in the 1950&rsquo;s that accurately predicted the conditions in the world in this decade. What would the public reaction have been?  Consider these &#8220;true predictions&#8221;:</p>
<p>1-Computers, orders of magnitude more powerful than any even envisioned, that only weigh a few pounds, and will cost less than a small television. </p>
<p>2-By 1970, America will have acheived human landings on the moon.</p>
<p>3-The Internet.</p>
<p>4- The developement of biotechnology, and the decoding of the genome.</p>
<p>5-The Cold War will be over, without a nuclear weapon being detonated.</p>
<p>6-Federal judges will mandate Forced Bussing, and the American people accepting it, without serious resistance.</p>
<p>7-White men will be systematicly denied educational and employment opportunities, in favor of women and non-Whites. </p>
<p>8-Diversity will be considered a great virtue. It would take a chapter just to explain what Diversity is to 1950&rsquo;s Americans.</p>
<p>9-America&rsquo;s population will exceed 300,000,000. Non-White immigration will be the major factor in shaping America&rsquo;s demographics.</p>
<p>10-One of the men who will make a great contribution to #4, will be villified for making true statements about Blacks. </p>
<p>11-Federal judges will decree that abortion is a Constitutional right.</p>
<p>Etc.,Etc.,Etc.</p>

		<p>Posters 17 &amp; 18. Thank you both for making alot of sense on these topics. I&rsquo;ve always liked how the &#8220;secular&#8221; left or &#8220;scientific&#8221; left can claim that science is king, yet on science involving different racial/ethnic groups they are mute, or flat out defensive. Someone needs to tell those liberal extremists that they can&rsquo;t have their science and denounce someone else&rsquo;s. The same with free speech. Only for the Marxists is what I&rsquo;ve been seeing. And about our &#8220;friends&#8221; in the Republican party. They are NOT your friends if they continue to implement the policies that are killing the middle-class white lifestyle, allowing universities to gouge people with insane tuition costs, and NOT eradicating the ridiculously hypocritical &#8220;hate&#8221; crime laws on the books. They are just as guilty as the Democrats on that one. Eric Holder the hypocrite? Yes but we expect it from someone like that. I don&rsquo;t expect it from someone like Ron Paul or Lou Dobbs. That&rsquo;s the insult. </p>

		<p>The GOP probably should actively court Hispanic bloc-voters by promising them goodies for which we will be expected to pay.  I say they should do this because the GOP has already utterly discredited itself with rational, thinking whites, and they&rsquo;ll need to find votes somewhere else.</p>
<p>I receive spam email from Michael Steele nearly every day, and none of it will ever have the remotest chance of convincing me to vote GOP ever again.  Quite the opposite.  My typical replies to the RNC in general and Steele in particular would be quite unprintable here.</p>
