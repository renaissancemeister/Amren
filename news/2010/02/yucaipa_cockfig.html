<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/inland_empire&amp;id=7281901">Yucaipa Cockfight Breeding Facility Raided</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Banfield, KABC-TV (Los Angeles), February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Acting on a tip from the Humane Society of the U.S., authorities have confiscated hundreds of roosters and hens in San Bernardino County. The raid was conducted just outside the city of Yucaipa. It&rsquo;s believed the poultry was being supplied to Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigators did believe that the property owners were raising, breeding, training and selling these birds to Mexico, where these birds were made to fight in derbies,&#8221; said San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Spokesperson Jodie Miller.</p>
<p>A copy of a Mexican cockfighting magazine outlined the high entry fees and very high prizes for some of the legal events held in Mexico.</p>
<p>Some of these pictures in Yucaipa released by the Humane Society show the chickens  &mdash;  more than 600, more than 400 of them roosters  &mdash;  are well cared for and well fed. Officials say evidence supporting their accusation of breeding and training of game birds was seized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No arrests have been made. The owners of this operation are in Mexico and a caretaker is caring for the hundreds of birds remaining at the location.</p>
<p>Authorities believe that most of the battle fowl raised and trained here are shipped to Mexico. But dealing with illegal cockfighting is a problem for authorities in the United States.<br>

		<p>Cockfighting, like dogfighting, is entertainment for the lower classes.  The vast majority of the Mexican population is lower class, uneducated, and for them violence, blood and death are considered entertaining.  Higher class countries don&rsquo;t have this type of cruel sport - it&rsquo;s only the lowest of the low.  This does not reflect well on the Mexican people AT ALL.</p>

		<p>Curious then why members of Keystone United and other pro-white groups have gotten involved with Dogfighting or breeding dogs for fighting. It is not just for lower classes or blacks and mexicans but a horribly deplorable act committed by all rungs of people. In order too make change we must go too these pro-white groups and people and tell them too stop doing this and also too stop threatening violence against other people. I think that was a big problem with the conference getting shut down too many people involved have been either supportive of violence or have been associated in some way too the violence. We need to keep the &#8220;crazies&#8221; out of our movement and distinguish ourselves from them.</p>
<p>Sincerely, <br>

		<p>&#8220;Apparently Americans export illegal fighting cocks to Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Americans my ass.  Just last week there was a story around here about people using Finches to fight.  Yeah, you read that right, Finches.  Some Fed. team arrested them all, and yet no race/ethnicity was specified.  But, the story had a nice ending sentence on how ALL the previous people arrested for fighting Finches were Brazilian.  I&rsquo;ve always figured the Japanese had a thing for Finches.</p>

		<p>One time a long time ago now witnessed a game cock derby in Missouri.</p>
<p>Man raising fighting game cocks on his back-woods property and selling the birds to a variety of foreign locations. Able to ship without problem very highly sought after American fighting game cocks. American game cocks are reputedly the best in the world. Fed a good diet, trained under humane conditions, disease free, etc.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson and George Washington raised and fought game cocks. So it must be OK.</p>
