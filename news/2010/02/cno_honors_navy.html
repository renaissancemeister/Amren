	<p>Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class (SW) Kyle P. Malloy, Chief of Naval Operations Public Affairs</p>
<p>Story Number: NNS100222-08</p>
<p>Release Date: 2/22/2010 5:03:00 PM </p>
<p>BALTIMORE (NNS)  &mdash;  The chief of naval operations (CNO) was an honorary presenter at the Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA) gala Feb. 20.</p>
<p>CNO, Adm. Gary Roughead presented two Navy civilians and a former Navy lieutenant with awards at the gala; Steffanie Easter and Sharon Smoot received the Professional Achievement in Government Award and Davede Alexander received the Diversity Leadership Award, all which recognized the great talent, intelligence, and leadership within the African American professional community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Holding events like the Black Engineer of the Year awards is important because it allows us as a Navy, as a military and as a nation to recognize the great contributions that men and women of diverse backgrounds make to our Navy, to our nation, to the military, and to so many different walks of life,&#8221; said Roughead.</p>
<p>The event helped promote and advocate the strength an organization gains from a diverse workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be a better Navy because of diversity,&#8221; said Roughead. &#8220;Diversity is bringing together different perspectives, different experiences, different backgrounds, different opinions, and from that we will be able to solve problems better.&#8221;</p>
<p>BEYA is a three-day conference recognizing outstanding African American achievers in areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from top companies around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s been an event that I look forward to every year,&#8221; said Roughead. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a great sense of pride and accomplishment and it&rsquo;s just terrific to be a part of it all.&#8221;<br>

<p>That is a definition of diversity.  But it does not explain how diversity makes the Navy better.</p>
<p>If it is such a strength, then why is it that the only awards that black Naval personnel seem to be able to win are those specifically for blacks?</p>

		<p>I have never been in the service so please excuse my ignorance.  Isn&rsquo;t the purpose of the military, in addition to defending the country, to define a goal, to work together towards that goal and achieve success?  Wouldn&rsquo;t standing around debating diverse opinions leave the military open to being easily attacked and defeated?  Is the primary purpose of the military to be a social experiment?  I thought the services were top down organizations?  I am confused.</p>

		<p>I said once before on here but it fits again&hellip;My last US Navy duty station was with F-14 &#8220;Tomcats&#8221;, we had training every Thursday on systems (engines for me), very simple, just set there for 3 hours and pay attention and take a test on what you were just TOLD. If anybody failed that test, they were required to go in Saturday to redue it, seems the only ones that failed it were the Blacks, they screamed &#8220;Racism&#8221;, so know how they fixed this? They did away with the training all together.</p>

		<p>Bandmo:  you mean to tell us that the Navy does not train personnel to maintain their aircraft?  How is it done?  Naval airplanes seem to be very complex and it would seem they would require highly trained technicians/mechanics/engineers to keep them safe and in the air.</p>
<p>The military seems to have no trouble with putting service members lives in danger for the sake of diversity.  I guess Fort Hood is not an aberration.<br>

<p>This might be true if the perspectives, experiences, backgrounds, and opinions were relevent to the tasks the Navy is required to perform. But this is not the case. Diversity means people who belong to different classifications: racial, gender, ethnic, sexual preference, religious, etc.  At best, this is of no benefit. In most cases, it reduces communication and cooperation. In some cases, these differences can prevent a group from functioning, as they did at Fort Hood.</p>

<p>How true, but when those &#8220;different perspectives, different experiences, different backgrounds, different opinions&#8221; of the minorities are essentially valueless.</p>
<p>We had a far better navy in the days prior to brainwashed losers worshiping diversity, because we used to actually win our wars.  </p>
<p>Our &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; military occupies Iraq and Afghanistan and after nine years of trying still can&rsquo;t pacify a handful of illiterate medieval third-world camel traders who have no Navy, Air Force, or uniformed Army&hellip;</p>

<p>I hear this all the time where I work.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is a key to greater problem solving because having people in a room of various races and backgrounds brings &#8220;unique&#8221; perspectives that get the problem solved faster.  This idea is heavily pushed in such shows as CSI Miami, where diverse cast members all magically have some unique perspective that provides a breakthrough when everyone else is stumped.</p>
<p>This theme is the mantra of the diversity movement.  Do you know how it plays out in public schools?  The kids are grouped together by &#8220;differing&#8221; abilities and given some childish poster board project to complete.  This gets everyone &#8220;involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone has a different role, tailor made to their &#8220;multiple intelligences.&#8221;  The loser kid will be the time keeper.  The smart kid will do any written or reserch work.  The illiterate &#8216;artist&rsquo; will do the drawing and design for the visuals, and the average kid or two will get some misc. task like cutting and pasting or such.</p>
<p>I am not joking.  This is considered successful student work in urban high schools.  Everyone succeeds!  Yeah! Look at that wonderful project: cut and pasted text from the internet.  A big title.  Pictures printed from the internet.  Cutesy illustrations hand drawn.  </p>
<p>If your school ever talks about project based learning (which is what I described above) then get the person fired who wants to implement it, for your school will descend into stupid poster board projects real fast.</p>
<p>The only problem with the &#8216;diversity problem-solving model&rsquo; is that life is not about problem solving like this.  When an enemy frigate is bearing down on your position, getting &#8216;diverse&rsquo; people to collectively decide what to do is no way to make a solution.  If you are designing a new engine for a car, being black from the ghetto will not provide you with some unique perspective on engineering a proper gasket.  You need the best and the brightest, not the most &#8216;diverse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>You will never get around to solving any problems other than the problems BROUGHT ABOUT by bringing together those &#8220;different backgrounds, opinions&#8221;, et al. I fail to see how consuming your days trying to resolve compatibility issues between personnel will create a better anything. The Navy is already integrated - how&rsquo;s that working out for you? And it&rsquo;s befuddling how an award singled out for one racial group is in any way &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I doubt Cobbins will want a re-trial, Skip, because if he gets one, the death penalty becomes available again.</p>
<p>Istvan, the entire U.S. military is not much more than a welfare program for &#8220;ethnics&#8221; with a uniform, with the notable exception of the elite units (SF, SEALS and Marines) the rest are as/or more confused than you could possibly be or imagine. When the, mostly White, troops leave camps on patrol we are mostly left with the blacks and their ghetto conduct and I say again, I DO believe the % of blacks in the military is like 60% or better.</p>

		<p>I spent 20 years in the US Navy and retired from a TAR command, Naval Air Reserve, Brunswick ME.  I was one of the few straight White enlisted heterosexual males at that command and about half the enlisted people were minorities.  The place was a train wreck waiting to happen.  Every department was overmanned excessively and where I worked I believe there were twelve people to do the job of 3.  This is one of the ways the Navy makes diversity work; load down the workcenters with so many tax funded servicemembers that everyone has one or two simple tasks to do and the departments manage to squeak by even if the supervisor is an incompetent.  We had our annual EEO training which is the equivalent of diversity training but I remember one person they sent in from pre-flood New Orleans to give us a special seminar on equal opportunity which raised a few eyebrows.  The guy had a very soft whispery kind of voice that anyone who was wise to the ways of the world would know he was a homosexual.  Some of the topics were asking people about how they felt about interracial marriage and whether anyone was harrassed out in town or by sailors because of their relationships.  He then gave them information about who to report it to if they are ever discriminated against.  The whole training was about demonizing Whites and specifically White men and all I could do was sit there and grind my teeth because I knew if I spoke up I would somehow be punished.  I had a very short time left before I retired and didn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat.  I&rsquo;m positive that some of the more hard core militaries around the world like the Russians or the Chinese don&rsquo;t put up with this sort of diversity nonsense and have structures in place to weed out the undesirables and promote those that work hard and have ability.  The US Navy, at least from what I saw, has become nothing more than a welfare for work program with little work for alot of welfare.  Evaluations and FITREPS have become jokes and high marks aren&rsquo;t based on performance but politics and buddy networks.  Awards and decorations are passed out like candy with a disproportionate number of them going to people of color who did nothing beyond the call of duty except their everyday job.  Washington keeps close tabs on the number of minorities getting awards and if they&rsquo;re somehow out of sync with the population of minorities at the command, the CO can get into hot water.  It&rsquo;s all become one big joke and I fear for this country in the coming years as the rising black, brown and yellow tide washes away our European standards and ethics.    </p>

		<p>In the spirit of diversity and inclusion why don&rsquo;t they just have a Navy Engineer of the Year Awards?  If these black engineers&rsquo; accomplishments truly are as great as they are touted then let&rsquo;s be able to compare them with others and see how they stand up.  Or is that these people are figureheads, tokens, quotas, what have you, and these awards are a sham to maintain the illusion of equality?</p>
