			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Allen, Daily Mail (London), February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arab ambassador called for an instant divorce after discovering his veil-wearing fiancée had a beard and was cross-eyed, it emerged today.</p>
<p>The would-be bride had hidden her face behind a Muslim niqab throughout their short courtship, meaning the diplomat had no idea what she looked like.</p>
<p>But as soon as the marriage was contract was signed in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, he tried to kiss her, before coming face-to-face with her hairy face and strange squint.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was absolutely horrified,&rsquo; said a wedding guest.</p>
<p>&#8216;The bride had a nice personality, but there was a good reason why she was hiding her looks behind a veil.</p>
<p>&#8216;A divorce was inevitable, and the groom went straight to court leaving his new bride in floods of tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unnamed ambassador, who is in his 40s and has worked all over the world, including in Paris, told an Islamic Sharia court that he was tricked into the arranged marriage, Dubai&rsquo;s official government newspaper reported.</p>
<p>He claimed the woman&rsquo;s parents sent his own mother and and father pictures of her far more attractive sister.</p>
<p>A legal source said: &#8216;Every time the couple met, the bride would do her best hide her entire face.</p>
<p>&#8216;The woman, who is a physician, was very keen to marry him, as she had had very few suitors, even though she&rsquo;s well into her 30s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lawyers for the ambassador successfully called for the marriage to be annulled, but his demand for £100,000 to cover the cost of the wedding reception was rejected, following the conclusion of the case on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He had spent the money on food, drink, wedding cars and jewellery.</p>
<p>The ambassador&rsquo;s legal team also made an application for the woman to be examined for hormonal deficiencies, but when she went to see a doctor nothing out of order was found.</p>
<p>&#8216;She&rsquo;s devastated by the entire experience,&rsquo; added the source.</p>

		<p>This is really a sad situation.  She is sincere and it looks as though he just was not attracted to her, and so wants an instant divorce.</p>
<p>He is at fault for following a custom that makes no sense.  He married her without knowing her or seeing her.  How dumb can you get. Now he publicly humiliates her.  That is a mixed up heartless society. </p>

		<p>What did this guy expect? If you belong to a religion where the women hide their faces, then you can&rsquo;t be too picky about looks! </p>
<p>Women are certainly treated as second-class citizens in the Middle East, yet Western feminists have criticism only for supposed chauvinism in the West! Never a bad word to say about the barbaric practices elsewhere.</p>
<p>Islam is a strange religion, but liberalism is even stranger.</p>

		<p>Anonymous: you are right, this is cruel treatment of the poor woman. On the other hand, she must have understood that her suitor deserved a good look before marriage, and she must have realized that an ambassador would be a man with extraordinarily high self-regard. The covering of females is a barbaric custom. </p>

		<p>If she had whiskers so numerous as to be a beard that means she has a serious lack of estrogen and too much testosterone.  She probably has never ovulated.  Even if she does ovulate the beard means she would need massive hormone therapy to be able to conceive and bring the pregnancy to term.</p>
<p>A beard also indicates she might not be a fully formed woman.  Good thing he got a good look at her face before the honeymoon. Although strictly speaking good muslims are supposed to make love fully clothed.</p>
<p>We should not be too condescending to this arab.  Remember the French diplomat stationed in Peking?  For 18 years he blabbed secret information to his Chinese girlfriend.   Turned out the girlfriend was a fully formed man, a female impersonator in the Peking comic opera comapny.</p>

<p>Impossible.  The diagnosis of no hormonal deficiencies was probably made out of a combination of professional solidarity to another physician and her paying a higher bribe to the diagnosticial than he did.</p>
<p>Whiskers indicate lack of estrogen and too  much testostorone.</p>

		<p>This exact scenario is chronicled in the Old Testament. The Patriarch Jacob, desiring to wed Laban&rsquo;s daughter Rachael, found himself suckered into wedding a veiled woman. Upon uncovering her face, he found himself wed to Rachael&rsquo;s sister Leah, who had a &#8220;cast of eye&#8221;. (The bible doesn&rsquo;t mention a beard.) Jacob made the best of it however, and worked another seven years to get the woman he originally bargained for, Rachael. It is just barely possible, that western Christian men, having this example laid out for them, are smart enough not to buy a &#8220;pig in a poke&#8221; in the form of a veiled woman. <br>
I do feel sorry for the woman here, but she and her parents must have expected just such a reaction from the enraged groom.</p>

		<p>This is hard to believe. WHAT ambassador?  From WHAT country? Where was SHE from? Do these people have names?  All the facts are strangely missing here. Frankly, it sounds like a made-up story (which I wouldn&rsquo;t put past a sleazy British tabloid). Just more anti-Arab propaganda from the neo-cons?  I&rsquo;m neither pro-Arab nor pro-Moslem, but at least let&rsquo;s be honest and not invent news stories. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if she was embarassed by a mustache, that could easily have been removed.  Why not?  And crossed-eyes can be corrected. (After all, she&rsquo;s a physician, not an ignoramus; she should know that!)</p>

This sorry tale (well, not really that sorry) puts a new slant on that thing about covering up women so as not to &#8216;inflame&rsquo; men&rsquo;s out of control lust! Beard? Have a shave before you&rsquo;re wedding eh?<br>
I saw a Muslim husband and wife down at the shops the other day, she was twice the size of the husband, I said to myself, &#8216;don&rsquo;t drop that head-gear love!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>One would think she would have at least gotten rid of the facial hair, I am thinking she was a very conservative Muslim.</p>
<p>For some reason (probably due to the Quran encouraging men to wear trimmed beards) many conservative Muslim women think removing racial hair, even plucking their eyebrows, is wrong. On the otherhand all Muslims are encouraged to remove ALL thick hair below the neck (yes all), so they take care of that but then ignore a uni-brow or beard on a woman.</p>

		<p>Ok, I have to jump in on this one.  Your average middle eastern woman is an exact copy of Corporal Klinger from M*A*S*H.  As they age, it only gets worse.  There are only 2 countries that are not stamped in my passport from the region and I can honestly say, this theory is 90% true.  There are exceptions and one of them is Iran.  For some odd reason, Persian gals are hot and so are a few from Beirut but all in all, Klinger reigns supreme.  Especially in Saudi, Egypt (just close your eyes there), and Yemen.  On the other side of the arab world, beauty returns in Morocco and Tunisia perhaps because of the European influence.</p>

		<p>No, you just can&rsquo;t make this stuff up. LOL. This is funny as hell. </p>
<p>All along, people thought that Muslim men made their women wear veils, and tent-like Burkhas, because they wanted to dominate, control, and demean them; not because their gals had thicker beards then they did. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a woman.  I live in Los Angeles, in a neighborhood known as little Teheran.  I agree with you totally.  It&rsquo;s not just the young ones.  They are good looking all their lives.</p>
<p>But remember, Persians are not Arabs.  They are some Iranians of Arab ethnicity, but they are a small group.</p>
<p>Interesting reason why Persians are so uniformly good looking.  Since the Medes and Perisans arrived 5 thousand years ago, Iran had the pick of slave girls from central asia and eastern europe.</p>
<p>The slave brokers had certain standards.  Medium height, not short not tall.  Somewhat underweight for their height, not model thin but slender.  Well proportioned, which is why you will never see a big caboose on even a middle aged overweight Persian woman.  Nor do you ever see a really big bosom either.</p>
<p>Then nice long slim necks and slender ankles and wrists, no piano legs accepted.  Once Persia became muslim, the slave brokers adhered to Mohammed&rsquo;s preference for black and very dark actually black eyes.</p>
<p>But many of the Armenian,Jewish and Kurdish Iranians have brown or blonde hair and hazel eyes.  I&rsquo;ve never seen Iranians with blazing Irish blue eyes, but plenty of them have grayish blue eyes.</p>
<p>Some ethnic groups are lucky in being uniformly good looking,like the Swiss, Germans, Scandinavians and best looking of all of the European groups,the Irish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason why the viking and later the turkish muslim slavers raided Ireland so often.</p>

<p>I agree with GHW.  There are what? maybe 20 Arab countries at the most?  If he wants a divorce, why not just go back to his own country?  I don&rsquo;t know what Arab customs re: who pays for a wedding are. If he did pay for a fraudulent bride she and her parents should reimburse him.</p>
<p>GHW is right.  A phsician from a family that could afford to send her to med school would have had her eyes fixed as a child.</p>
<p>Remember, not all, but some of the Arab contries have excellent free or nominal cost national health systems supported by the oil money.</p>

		<p>I aggree that this story is hard to believe.  No specifics at all are given.  It&rsquo;s very fishy. <br>
If the marriage was never consummated, he could just ask for an annulment on the basis that he was deceived. He would&rsquo;nt even need a divorce because there never was an actual marriage. </p>
<p>Another thing, some ethnic groups are very hairy by nature, and some even consider it an attractive trait. If there is such a real person, and if her condition is true, she does not necessarily have any hormonal imbalance. Some Middle Easteners are extremely hairy.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the compliment, Jim in VA.  Modesty forbids comment on myself but my parents were quite something in their day, still are, and my sisters turn heads and generate effusive praise.</p>
<p>As for the bearded lady, why on Earth would the bride not have frantically shaved, waxed, depilated, electrolyzed, and lasered herself to a frazzle in anticipation of the inevitable big reveal?  Crossed eyes can also often be corrected surgically.</p>
<p>Given the ease of Muslim divorce (at least for a man), how did she and her family think this was going to work?</p>
<p>The lack of foresight as well as everything else makes this both strange and farcical.</p>

<p>Jim in VA, two things to note. What ETHNICITY was the character Klinger in M*A*S*H? Yup. Secondly, you mention Persian or Iranians. Don&rsquo;t you know that the term ARYAN comes from that exact part of the world?! </p>
<p>The reason why they are beautiful, is because they are (gasp) at least partially &#8220;ARYAN.&#8221; (Naziphobes, don&rsquo;t have a cow, it&rsquo;s just genetics)</p>
<p>Secondly, don&rsquo;t you see the UTTER FALSITY of this &#8216;religion&rsquo;? I taught Arabs ESL in a former life, back in the late &#8216;70&rsquo;s and &#8216;80&rsquo;s. This religion is all about the MAN&rsquo;s pleasure, and women get DIDDLY. You would think that all the liberal feminazis would see that a Christian civilization is MUCH superior to that of any Jihadist out there, and mate with their own! But no- every year, good &#8216;Christian&rsquo; girls marry these dusky sandmen, and my heart goes out to them, saying, WHY?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one more example of why the West is the best, and all the rest is&hellip;. just the rest.</p>
