<h1>Grant Aims to Brighten Black Males&rsquo; Future</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Education Association grant awarded to Durham schools is meant to improve the test scores and college and job readiness of black males.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many are in academic trouble,&#8221; school board Chairwoman Minnie Forte-Brown said Tuesday. &#8220;Too many are held back a grade. Too many fail to enroll in rigorous coursework. Too many drop out, and their scores are among the lowest of any demographic. That has to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The six schools involved in the new grant have large populations of black students and significant gaps in scores between black and white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Data from 2008-09 show that black students&rsquo; test scores in core subject areas are often less than two-thirds those of white students at the six schools and sometimes much lower. For instance, while all white students at Fayetteville Street were deemed proficient in math, only 34.1 percent of blacks were. At Chewning, 61 percent of white students and 21.6 percent of black students passed state reading tests. By comparison, 47.6 percent of Hispanic Fayetteville pupils passed math tests and 47.6 percent of Hispanic Chewning students passed reading tests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 70 percent of dropouts were black in 2007-08. That year, 84 percent of students given short-term suspensions and 67 percent of those given long-term suspensions were black. Black male students alone accounted for more than half of suspensions in both categories.</p>
<p>About 55 percent of black male students graduated from high school on time in 2008, compared to 86.5 percent of white males.</p>
<p>{snip}In North Carolina, the achievement gap was about 27 points in 2000 and 33.5 points in 2006.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.wral.com/news/education/story/6991882/">Durham Schools Win Grant to Boost Minority Achievement</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>WRAL-TV (Raleigh), February 9, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The NEA Foundation on Tuesday awarded Durham Public Schools $1.25 million to boost the classroom achievement of minority students.</p>
<p>The money will target black males in the early grades to help them graduate on time. Research shows the group is struggling the most within the district, said Kristy Moore, president of the Durham Association of Educators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that we have mentoring programs. We want to make sure that teachers have accessibility to go out to the homes and to visit parents and see what the students really need,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lakis said he sees many black students fall behind their peers in class. No one has been able to determine the reason for the disparity, but he said his job as a teacher is to address the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really trying to solve the problem, more so than diagnose it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moore said Durham schools will apply for mini-grants to pay for programs tailored to their individual needs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A teacher needs to wear the hat of a social worker and a care provider and a community organizer and get that involvement from the student, the parent, the grandparent (and) anybody who is involved in that child&rsquo;s life,&#8221; Lakis said.</p>

<p>How significant are the gaps between blacks and Hispanics?  Blacks and Asians?</p>
<p>They mention Hispanics in passing, but the crux of their comparison is the old white/black racial gap.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they concentrate on the black/Hispanic racial gap?  I mean Hispanics are doing far better than blacks as well?  Why aren&rsquo;t this comparison made instead of the black/white one.</p>
<p>And why don&rsquo;t they EVER write of the black/Asian gap?</p>
<p>I want to see more comparison to other non-whites, and I&rsquo;m writing them right now to tell them so. </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;Too many are in academic trouble,&rdquo; school board Chairwoman Minnie Forte-Brown said Tuesday. &ldquo;Too many are held back a grade. Too many fail to enroll in rigorous coursework. Too many drop out, and their scores are among the lowest of any demographic. That has to change.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Note the paradox:  they complain about too many dropouts/holdbacks, then complain about how they don&rsquo;t take classes that are hard enough.  If they take harder classes, then they&rsquo;ll flunk out and either drop out or be held back a grade.  If they take easy classes to pass and &#8220;graduate on time,&#8221; they won&rsquo;t have any hard classes on their transcript.  And while we&rsquo;re on that subject, don&rsquo;t believe that &#8220;hard courses&#8221; are really that hard   &mdash;   The Oprah, a few years ago, exposed the scam of &#8220;course title inflation,&#8221; that is, where the class in a black school is supposedly, e.g. trigonometry, but only simple algebra is being taught.  However, the transcript will show trig and the student&rsquo;s grade, and that&rsquo;ll fool too many people.  The Oprah had a young black woman, a senior in her high school in inner city Chicago, who is getting an A in her &#8220;trig&#8221; class, go out to the suburbs and sit in on a trig class in a white suburban high school.  She told The Oprah that she didn&rsquo;t know what was going on in that classroom, that it was far beyond her, and she didn&rsquo;t recognize any of the math.  Now remember, to the outside world, she&rsquo;s getting an A in trig.  The Oprah dug a little deeper, and the math she was really doing in &#8220;trig&#8221; was basic algebra.</p>
<p><i>The money will target black males in the early grades to help them graduate on time</i></p>
<p>If that is such a problem, then I have the answer:  Give every black man in America a HS diploma as a civil right of his turning 17 or 18 years old.  Therefore, all those costly social problems that we are told are a direct result of too many people not having HS diplomas will disappear.  Right?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;A teacher needs to wear the hat of a social worker and a care provider and a community organizer and get that involvement from the student, the parent, the grandparent (and) anybody who is involved in that child&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; Lakis said.</i></p>
<p>Ironically, this grant comes from the foundation under the aegis of America&rsquo;s most powerful teachers&rsquo; union, and the NEA has rightly complained that too many teachers are asked to be social workers and community activists, thereby reducing their teaching energies.</p>

		<p>Durham County (home of Demario Atwater) is the Haiti of North Carolina (with a Duke Unidiversity transposed into the middle of same) and western co-bordering neighbor Orange County (Eve Carson&rsquo;s old Unidiversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill digs) is sort of like a fusion of the Dominican Republic, San Francisco, and Chicago.  </p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t good money after bad, since what has changed?</p>

<p>This statement tells us all we need to know.  Don&rsquo;t try to diagnose the problem, we might not like what we find.  Instead, throw money at it and hope it magically goes away.  Good thing these non-diagnosing dimwits aren&rsquo;t studying heart disease or trying to find a cure for cancer.  Rather, they are just plunging our educational system, already on life-support, further into the abyss.</p>

<p>Question Diversity, that&rsquo;s some pretty good common sense thinking there.  Since so many black students are being passed in classrooms and graduating from high school without basic reading and writing comprehension, why waste all that taxpayer money and just give them a diploma.  I don&rsquo;t think school attendance should be mandatory either.  </p>

<p>The jist of it is that requirements for &#8220;hard&#8221; math classes have been a big flop.</p>
<p>As someone who was once on a committee to choose new math textbooks for my school district when I was in high school, and as someone who used to be the fount of mathematics education, I have sorta come to my senses about the matter.  The problem with the mentality of &#8220;the more math the better&#8221; is that the only way you can make a living out of math ability is to be exceptionally good at it.  If you&rsquo;re pretty good like I am, but far from exceptional, then you might as well be bad at it.  There&rsquo;s no living to be made out of going no further than basic differential equations, which is where I hit my brick wall of understanding.  </p>
<p>Most people only need to understand simple algebra at most, and most of those who seem to deal with math more complicated than that have calculators to do the grunt work for them.  Do you think the banker who takes your mortgage application actually sits down with pen and paper and solves for P=L[c(1+c)^n]/[(1+c)^n-1]?   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as well anyway   &mdash;   Most people can&rsquo;t grok more than simple algebra, because that&rsquo;s the point past which math becomes entirely a cerebral pursuit, and no amount of &#8220;practical applications&#8221; (read: putting a copy of a lithogram of a black face of a man who did something interesting with legumes in 1890 after having taken the first derivative of an ax^2+bx+c function) relating to very complicated math will help you learn said math.  It is pretty interesting (i.e. useless) to know that Rastus Leroy Freeman was taught by his former master to do some calculus, and one day he did take such a first derivative, and this enabled him to create some practical applications for black eyed peas for building railroads, solving malnutrition, and so on and so forth.  But knowing that doesn&rsquo;t help you do calculus and find the first derivative of an ax^2+bx+c function.  You either have the chops to do it, or you don&rsquo;t, even if Rastus Leroy Freeman did.</p>

		<p>Once again, massive amounts of money, taxed from the earnings of whites, are thrown at non-whites. What would a good civil disobedience campaign look like for white people protesting this discrimination? Perhaps choosing &#8220;black&#8221; as ones race whenever race is requested on a bureaucratic form. </p>

		<p>Perhaps the solution is to loosen the child labor laws so that teenagers could get jobs instead of going to high school. When you think about the reality of getting out of high school at 18 with no education and more importantly no work ethic, its pretty scary. You could let them take math and english on a part time basis. The history lessons are revisionist, the science you could learn on the internet, and the rest of it is filler to justify a full time job for teachers. </p>

		<p>For thousands of years, the non-African world has proclaimed that blacks are not as intelligent as Europeans and Asians.  Then, in the 1960&rsquo;s, the West decided that this old adage wasn&rsquo;t true.  Now, a half century later, the excuses for black underachievement are getting threadbare.  But the liberals have to keep repeating the same refrain, or their own worldview will begin to unravel and be exposed as fraudulent.  <br>
School systems have tried every method of teaching and social intervention dreamed of, and nothing has changed.  So, what to do?  More of the same.  It&rsquo;s just too bad billions are wasted in this fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>

		<p>I agree so much with poster #1.  Where I&rsquo;m at (teaching) there are no white students in any school for several miles around.  Why don&rsquo;t they compare the blacks, hispanics and asians with each other and talk about those gaps?  There are no more white students left around here!  Politically active people need to push this in a big way.  Refocus the minorities (majorities) on each other and let the social justice movement see how much sand its house is built on!  Asians will not yield to any group.  Latinos look down on blacks in a big way and blacks haven&rsquo;t thought yet about how they can put the financial squeeze on the latinos and asians who deny them jobs, segregate from them, etc.</p>

		<p>It just don&rsquo;t get any sillier. In our local rag, the Houston Chronicle, a front-page story tells us 400 teachers may face firing. Because of &#8220;regression&#8221; by students.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s stop and think. Our city, like most, have a problem attracting and retaining really good teachers to begin with. I mean who wants to teach a class made up largely of children of illegal immigrants who can barely speak English, or Blacks who do speak English&hellip; of a sort. </p>
<p>The possibility that those regressionist students are either Blacks or Hispanics is probably 99.9999%. So realistically, how can we punish (FIRE) teachers for the mental deficiency of those students? We are rapidly degenerating into an Alice-in-Wonderland country. With our utterly asinine policy of political correctness doing no small part in bringing down our country. As does that other bit of criminal insanity&hellip; LOWERING THE STANDARDS for minority students. Fer pete&rsquo;s sake, Americans. We need to wake the hell up and hold our elected politicians&rsquo; feet to the fire. Either they start thinking like we want &#8216;em to, or we toss worthless political hacks the hell out!</p>
<p>Thankfully the mid-term election is drawing near. Make damned sure not to re-elect any congressman or senator from your state, unless you are damned sure he or she has and is doing the right thing for Americans. Instead of selling out to the special interest groups (La Raza comes to mind), or the corporate donors bankrolling his/her campaign.</p>
<p>Time to kick the incumbents out and keep them out; then break in new replacements who are responsible to the American Voters, not the lobbyists and special interest groups. Congress needs to learn one bitter lesson: You work for the American citizens, or you do not, repeat, DO NOT get re-elected to Congress ever again!</p>

		<p>Reading some of the pro/con posts on NewsVine lately, I couldn&rsquo;t help but crack up over some outrageous claims by a Black poster.</p>
<p>About the only thing his early Africans did NOT accomplish: Harnessing cold fusion for power. But yes, they did deserve credit for just about everything else.</p>
<p>I guess the next step will be to burn all the history books, certainly books on medical and scientific accomplishments, because we wouldn&rsquo;t want those uppity White folks to learn the truth. We probably will also have to institute a McCarthesque affirmation of our unshakeable, unquestionable belief in African History&hellip; to graduate from schools and colleges; to qualify for future employment.</p>
<p>I swear, I can&rsquo;t believe the garbage being taught in our diploma factories respective to those magnificent African accomplishments centuries before those horrid Europeans discovered the continent.</p>

		<p>If money were the solution to the black achievement gap, blacks would be at the pinnacle of the American civilization, given the trillions lavished on them since the Sixties.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ve criminalized any expression of the opinion that black lack of achievement may be (or is clearly) genetic in origin.  </p>
<p>Thus we have a harsh reality rather than a &#8220;problem&#8221; perpetually<br>
in a desperate search for a solution. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a High School teacher and I wholeheartedly agree with you. I&rsquo;m  a teachers&rsquo; union member although I don&rsquo;t agree with a large portion of their philosphy, however I also don&rsquo;t agree with the my fellow coservatives who want to argue that because of the unions, there are too many incompetent teachers. Yes there are teachers who are not achieving results but many of their problems are due neither to to their incompetence nor to their unwilligness but rather to the conditions with which they&rsquo;re faced every day depending on the demographics of the districts in which they teach.<br>
With some notable exceptions, the majority of Blacks and many Hispanics have no interest in being educated. Their entire lives are dedicated to &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real&#8221; (whatever that means), the pursuit of copulation opportunities and the sale or use of drugs.In fact the high perfoming Black student, especially a male, is an anomaly.<br>
Our cowardly politicians are quick to blame teachers for the students&rsquo; failure to reach the state mandated goals because the consequences of telling the truth would be disastrous to their careers.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been teaching for over four decades and I&rsquo;ve seen a constant round of recycled educational philosophies come and go; most of them repackaged and renamed and basically dedicated to lowering the bar for achievement in order to avoid facing the truth of the demographics with which we&rsquo;re dealing . There is no solution until we face the problem i.e. that we are catering to an ever increasingly larger segment of society that is not willing to adjust to a culture that values education and civilized behavior. Instead, we COPE with their pathologies and trust to Divine Providence. If these pathologies are the result of family disfunction, then the fault lies with the particular demographic and they and they only hold the key to the solution.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:<br>
   Sorry you&rsquo;re a bit out of date on the uses and usefulness of math (various types).  The economy in industrialized nations has changed *drastically* in the last 15 years or so, as for &#8220;mathematization&#8221;.  Math at all levels has suddenly become useful in all sorts of industrial development, at all levels (from high-level strategy down to circuit-board layout  &mdash;  even clothing design) plus the new &#8220;information age&#8221; products (facebook apps, search engines:  lots of probability &amp; statistics in use).  Even if one&rsquo;s job appears to use only algebra, some issue might come up where one&rsquo;s boss says, &#8220;Can you show me how close this procedure comes to the ideal solution?&#8221; and that may take a convergence proof or something from approximation theory!  There is plenty of opportunity to use advanced math in jobs that aren&rsquo;t &#8220;mathematician&#8221; jobs.  </p>
<p>Managers don&rsquo;t advertise for mathematicians much any more.  The ads today are for programmers who can do some math as well as chug out code.  Deeper math is becoming more comfortable for young people, so sophomore-level summer programming interns can probably get to use some real math on the job (while not being  full-fledged credentialed mathematicians).  </p>
<p>If math were part of the general atmosphere of society, like oxygen, there will be a lot less &#8220;I&rsquo;m stuck!&#8221;, &#8220;We just have to guess at this&#8221;, and &#8220;This is messy but it&rsquo;s the best we can do&#8221; in industry. </p>
<p>Also I can&rsquo;t see how anyone with a normal or even slightly subnormal IQ can&rsquo;t take a derivative of a quadratic.  It&rsquo;s just a procedure:  plug and chug.  </p>

<p>Have you ever taught Algebra I or Basic Math to below average students?</p>
<p>I have and it is immensely frustrating for both teacher and student when the student simply cannot grasp basic math concepts no matter what you do or how many different ways you explain it. And, as Anon #22 explained, many students these days, especially NAMs with IQs averaging 85-90, are completely disconnected from education and not interested in learning anything.</p>
<p>Many billions, if not trillions of dollars have been wasted over the course of four decades trying to find a method to successfully teach those with IQs of 85-90  Algebra, Geometry and Algebra II.  If something worked, it would have been found by now.  Nothing works (and it never will).  The money would have been better spent nurturing above average students and providing special classes and services for them; instead, they are ignored.</p>
<p>Those on the left-half of the Bell Curve struggle mightily as it is with very basic math, which many never grasp, and Algebra is absolutely beyond them.  </p>
<p>Here is a problem from the NAEP test, the so-called Gold Standard of student academic achievement:</p>
<p>There were 90 employees in a company last year.  This year the number of employees increased by 10 percent.  How many employees are in the company this year?</p>
<p>(A) 9  (B) 81  (C) 91  (D) 99  (E) 100</p>
<p>77.5 % of eighth graders got this problem wrong.  </p>
<p>As Charles Murray explains in Real Education:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Ask them what 90 plus 9 equals and almost all of them can add those numbers.  What they fail to do is put everything together  &mdash;  to realize that first they had to take 10 percent of 90 and then add the result to 90.  This logical step does not lend itself to being taught in the same way that the rules for addition and multiplication can be taught&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem with below average students is they do not have the capacity to absorb and retain material and the logical-mathematical ability to infer, deduce, extrapolate and interpolate.</p>
<p>These things cannot be taught and it is the very definition of insanity and hubris to presume that is it possible.  It is also the height of insanity to throw trillions more dollars at a goal that can never be attained, i.e. closing the achievement gap.</p>

		<p><i>Thankfully the mid-term election is drawing near. Make damned sure not to re-elect any congressman or senator from your state, unless you are damned sure he or she has and is doing the right thing for Americans. Instead of selling out to the special interest groups (La Raza comes to mind), or the corporate donors bankrolling his/her campaign.</i></p>
<p>Time to kick the incumbents out and keep them out; then break in new replacements who are responsible to the American Voters, not the lobbyists and special interest groups. Congress needs to learn one bitter lesson: You work for the American citizens, or you do not, repeat, DO NOT get re-elected to Congress ever again!<p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer a huge fan of voting,although it&rsquo;s doubtful if I could ever have been considered a fan at all. Because do you know what you&rsquo;re doing when you agree to abide by the results of a vote?</p>
<p>You are agreeing in advance to lose,and to lose gracefully.</p>
<p>Losing at all,much less losing gracefully,is no longer an option for us melanin challenged types. </p></p>

		<p>After fifty years of throwing zillions of tax dollars at low-performing black students, we are told &#8220;It just wasn&rsquo;t enough money.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was under the impression that continuing a behavior that doesn&rsquo;t work while expecting a different result was the acme of insanity.  I guess I was wrong.  My bad.  In the meantime, Durham will have to wait and see.</p>

		<p>I agree with Question Diversity about math.  </p>
<p>The only reason my daughter and I both took high school Algebra 2 was because it was a requirement to take the Electrician Apprentice exam.  Once that exam was passed, the only math we ever used was basic addition, subtraction and percentages to estimate interest payments for personal use. I took that exam 46 years ago.  She took that exam in 1985.</p>
<p>Electricians make about $60,000 to $100,000 per year depending on how much work there is and how often one is a foreman.  So high school algebra 2 was useful.  But its only use was the fact that it appeared on our high school transcripts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t insurance companies still hire math majors as actuaries?  Or has all that work been subcontracted out to slave labor China and India?</p>

		<p>Bon, you must have taken the California teachers credentialing exam.  I actually laughed out loud at the &#8220;algebra&#8221; section of the test which was geared toward enabling 70 to 90 IQ black college graduates to get their teaching credential along with an affirmative action school principal job, $150,000 per year.</p>
<p>Here is the algebra part of the California teaching credential test I took.</p>
<p>If X+2 = 3 what is X</p>
<p>If 3+X =4 what is X</p>
<p>If 2+X =5 what is X</p>
<p>The fractions were all variations of 1/2 and 1/4.  The percentages were mostly the easiest,5 or 10 percent.  I understand that White 4th graders have taken some of the state teachers exams and passed easily.</p>
