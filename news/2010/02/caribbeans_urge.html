<h1>Caribbeans Urged to Write in Ancestry on US Census</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Kay, Washington Post, February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Identify yourself as being of &#8220;Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin&#8221; on the 2010 U.S. Census questionnaire, and you will get to be more specific about your ancestry, such as Mexican-American, Cuban or Puerto Rican.</p>
<p>But check the box for &#8220;black, African-American or Negro&#8221; and there will be no place to show whether you trace your identity to the African continent, a Caribbean island or a pre-Civil War plantation.</p>
<p>Some Caribbean-American leaders are urging their communities to write their nationalities on the line under &#8220;some other race&#8221; on the forms arriving in mailboxes next month, along with checking the racial categories they feel identify them best.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another push tied to the 2010 Census, advocates are urging indigenous immigrants from Mexico and Central America to write in groups such as Maya, Nahua or Mixtec so the Census Bureau can tally them for the first time.</p>
<p>The campaign in the multiethnic Caribbean community reflects a tendency, born from multiple waves of migration, to establish identity first by country, then by race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 2.4 percent of the U.S. population  &mdash;  more than 6.8 million people  &mdash;  identified on the 2000 Census as belonging to two or more races. A little less than 1 percent of the population  &mdash;  more than 1.8 million people  &mdash;  wrote in their West Indian ancestry.</p>
<p>And about 874,000 people  &mdash;  or 0.3 percent of the population  &mdash;  ticked boxes for Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders that year. If those islanders could get their own categories on the form, Caribbean-American leaders say, why not their communities?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While most Caribbeans are expected to at least check the box for &#8220;black,&#8221; lumping them together with all African-Americans means corporations and politicians won&rsquo;t see the political, economic and social issues specific to their immigrant communities, Persaud said. They also won&rsquo;t see the size of those communities or get a sense of the diversity of experiences among Afro-Caribbean groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Efforts to push the federal government to recognize specific communities have grown since the 1960s, when residents began filling out the forms on their own, said Ann Morning, a sociology professor at New York University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s more recognition of diversity within the black community, Morning said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For so long, black meant a particular kind of ethnic identity  &mdash;  a native-born descendent of slaves who had been in the South generations ago,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now people are increasingly realizing there are other kinds of African descent.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I just received the American Community Survey in the mail today and was shocked by the level of information the Census Bureau is trying to acquire. From what I read this community survey is distinct from the normal census.</p>
<p>Aside from the shocking amount of personal financial information they ask, it does give all types of options for &lsquo;minorities&rsquo; to break down their race into categories which can be used to their benefit. They&rsquo;ll use these new groups to skew the percentage of Whites still left in this country.</p>
<p>Personally, if I was black I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be lumped with American blacks either but in the end they all have the same goal.</p>

		<p>Expect this sort of posturing to continue in all forms as a once-great nation sinks further into multicult despair.  If a country is comprised of myriad different groups, said groups will all be jockeying for position.  Unless, of course, we&rsquo;re talking about WHITES.  </p>

<p>If this information does something for these corporate moguls besides scare them, then they are certainly better men than me. </p>

		<p>Our next UK census is due in 2011. I don&rsquo;t believe there has ever been, nor will there be, a tick box for &#8216;White English&rsquo; as this would be racist. I think we will be lumped together with &#8216;White British&rsquo; which is not the same thing at all. A bit like being termed &#8216;European&rsquo; which also fits the same geopolitical classification. Englishmen, according to our government, exist only to pour tax money into the scottish educational and health  system which is free for them there but cost we English in England a fortune. However, there are those who can be sub-divided in a more equitable manner and who doth protest loudly.<br>

		<p>People in Latin America who can possibly get away with calling themselves white usually do so.  Even in the DR, where the vast majority is mulatto, most folks insist that their brown or tan coloring is due to Native American ancestry.  I&rsquo;ve known of a man from there myself, who was clearly of African heritage, who always referred to himself as Latin.  And another, from PR, told people he wasn&rsquo;t black, but Puerto Rican  &mdash;  like the latter was a race.</p>

<p>White PRs do this also  &mdash;  thats is, say that they&rsquo;re not white, but Puerto Rican. </p>

		<p>I have some black acquaintances who look down their noses at American blacks - the Trinidadians want nothing to do with them, and the Kenyans consider them lazy whiners and don&rsquo;t want to be classified with them.  FINALLY somebody besides non-blacks are seeing American blacks for the victim-entitlement whiners that they are!!!</p>
