			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexander Bolton, The Hill, January 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Senate Democrats have reached out to former CNN anchor and prominent illegal-immigration opponent Lou Dobbs in an effort to build broad bipartisan support for immigration reform.</p>
<p>Winning the support of Dobbs, who became a prominent critic of illegal immigration and proposals to grant amnesty to illegal workers, could provide a significant boost to reform efforts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is spearheading the Democrats&rsquo; effort to put together a comprehensive reform bill, met with Dobbs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re meeting with all different kinds of groups, trying to get everybody together to come out for one bill,&#8221; Schumer said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Schumer noted that Dobbs, who left CNN in November, is &#8220;changing his views on immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third-ranking member of the Democratic leadership said he is looking for two Republicans to co-sponsor legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to have this bill be a bipartisan bill [and have] two Democrats and two Republicans to introduce it,&#8221; Schumer said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not there yet; we&rsquo;re still working on getting our Republicans.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s simply amazing how quickly Lou Dobbs has made himself so irrelevant.  Does anybody anywhere pay attention to him?  I wonder how his radio show is doing in ratings?  Maybe he&rsquo;ll switch to doing it in Spanish.  About the only person willing to give him a few minutes is his fellow opportunist, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>

		<p>What is Schumer talking about? Dobbs, and his opinons for that matter, are basically irrelevant! Much of his popularity was based upon him giving a voice on mainstream TV regarding illegal-immigration to those who felt they had none. Why then would anyone be concerned with his opinions one way or the other, if indeed he has turned his back on the very core issue that drew most of his viewers and fans to him in the first place? </p>
<p>Schumer and his ilk should think again if they really believe getting Dobbs on their side is going to change anyone&rsquo;s mind about illegals and this phoney &#8220;reform&#8221; claptrap!</p>

		<p>Giving radical liberals both houses of congress, plus the presidency was national suicide by the voters, especially since the president is a radical pro-black extremist whose entire agenda has only the welfare of blacks front and center and no other group at all, except for a few non-whites, who are anti-white, here and there.</p>
<p>To stop this far left freight train from indiscriminately passing anything and everything that is in direct opposition to the white power structure will take another calamity as great as the financial collapse of 3/2009.</p>
<p>I firmly believe it&rsquo;s coming, but will it come in time to curtail the mad agenda of these hateful radicals?</p>

		<p>Dobbs was putting on an act to attract the &#8216;angry white American&rsquo; demographic. He never believed anything he said.</p>
<p>When his house was shot at, he realized that people were taking his act seriously and he quit.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s alleged to have &#8216;seen the light&rsquo;, &#8216;recognized the error of his ways&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;s been transformed. He&rsquo;s been &#8216;saved&rsquo; by the liberal Schummer himself! Shout Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Folks, this is all part of the show. </p>

		<p>Dobbs apparently thinks that people liked him for him and that they opposed illiegal immigration just because he did.  He doesn&rsquo;t realize that his opposition to illegal immigration was practically the only reason anyone listened to him.  By back peddaling on the one thing we was known for, he has made himself an irrelevant has been.  </p>

		<p>Lou Dobbs has been married to his Hispanic wife for many years. I never could understand how anyone thought he was anti-Hispanic when he slept with one every night.</p>
<p>I am disappointed about what happened to Lou Dobbs. (Now I have no reason at all to watch CNN, which is a good thing.) I am certain we will never know the truth about what happened to him. His support for amnesty is disgusting and sickening&hellip;.and I will never forgive him.</p>

		<p>I always thought Lou Dobbs was a &#8216;con man&rsquo; even when he was on TV spouting his anti-illegal immigrantion tirades.  In the back of my mind was always the question of why was he on CNN since it is so liberal.  On the same station as Wolfe Blitzer? Those conversations between the two of them before Dobb&rsquo;s program seemed so rehearsed.  I wrote Lou Dobbs several times asking him to talk more about affirmative action and racial set-asides to no avail.  These topics are very much connected with immigration, legal or not since these groups of non-whites will be put into the protected classes of reciprients and will therefore benefit from those policies.  Now, Senator Chuck Schumer is buddying up to him.  This isn&rsquo;t new.  It smells to me.  I think this was well planned out while Dobbs was still on TV serving us the pablum against illegal immigration to keep the White population quiet.  These people are all elitists of course, and it is in their best interest that they feed us this kind of propaganda that we should accept as gospel that Dobbs is looking out for us still.</p>

<p>This agenda appears to be the agenda of the White componants of his cabinet too, NOT surprisingly.</p>

		<p>Apparently, Dobbs was just a snake oil salesman, pushing whatever would make him popular.  Now that he&rsquo;s lost his venue, he&rsquo;s looking for the next one, be it pro or con.  I wonder about people like Glenn Beck, as well.  Notice how much his POV changed after hiring on with Fox?</p>

<p>Have you seen the numerous episodes of his program Beck has dedicated SOLELY to Blacks? I believe it is more than safe to say he is NOT on our side. </p>
