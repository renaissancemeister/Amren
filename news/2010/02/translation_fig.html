<h1><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/7130467/Translation-figures-wrong-ministers-admit.html">Translation Figures Wrong, Ministers Admit</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, LondonTelegraph, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Ministry of Justice admitted it has spent more than £20 million pounds on interpreters and translators in the last two years, fuelling concerns over the impact immigration is having on the public purse.</p>
<p>The figure included £11.8 million spent in 2007/08 which was higher than MPs had previously been told in a series of parliamentary written answers.</p>
<p>One, to Dominic Grieve, the shadow justice secretary, last year was more than £1 million short of the true figure, while Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, was told spending had been £11.4 million.</p>
<p>Another, in 2008, only had figures for translation services and not interpreters while the fourth suggested more than £28 million had been spent in that year.</p>
<p>Mr Green said: &#8220;These mistakes cast a further cloud of the accuracy of Government figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;However you present them, it shows how expensive the need for interpreters in the legal system has become as more and more people in this country are simply unable to understand English.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spending figures refer to services for victims of crime and other court users but not suspects, which is funded by the police and Home Office.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: &#8220;To ensure that justice is done efficiently and effectively, defendants, victims and witnesses must understand the questions they are asked and be able to give an accurate account of events. It is clearly not right to question a defendant who doesn&rsquo;t understand English without an interpreter present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interpretation and translation services are provided on the basis of need. Costs are kept to a minimum and have not risen in recent years. The Office of Government Commerce (OGC) has established a framework for translation and interpretation to ensure that these services are secured in the most cost efficient manner possible across government.&#8221;<br>

		<p>These costs are only the beginning. In January 2009, overall, one in 30 primary schools have more than 70 per cent of youngsters with a foreign language as their mother tongue. In one part of the country, six in ten schools are in such a position. It means one in seven youngsters in primary schools - or 466,420 - do not have English as their first language. Critics last night said the high proportions are another sign of the impact Labour&rsquo;s open door on immigration and risks hampering integration. It also has serious implications for already-stretched schools resources. Unions have estimated educating a single non-English speaking pupil can cost up to £30,000 a year, although these figures do not break down how many pupils cannot speak English at all, only whether it is their first language. Labour MP Frank Field, the co-chairman of the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration who unearthed the statistics, said: &#8220;These figures make a nonsense of the Government&rsquo;s aim of integration and show the very real strain that uncontrolled, large scale immigration is already placing upon our society.&#8221; His co-chairman and Tory MP Nicholas Soames added: &#8220;In hundreds of primary schools, English is the second language for over 70 per cent or more of the pupils. &#8220;How can these children be expected to integrate into our society, if they are being taught in schools where is English is the mother-tongue of no pupils or a minority of pupils?&#8221;  Figures seen by the Daily Telegraph show there are ten primary schools where no pupil has English as their first language, including St Hilda&rsquo;s Church of England Primary in Oldham, which is predominantly attended by youngsters of Bangladeshi descent. Headteacher of the 270-strong school, Gill Pursey, said she was not surprised by the numbers, adding: &#8220;A primary school serves its community and we are based in a community that is predominantly Bangladeshi.&#8221; The figures showed 591 primaries in England, out of 17,205, have more than 70 per cent of pupils who do not have English as their first language. Tower Hamlets, east London, has the greatest concentration, with some 62 per cent of primaries having seven in ten pupils in such a position. Shadow Immigration Minister, Damian Green said: &#8220;Schools can&rsquo;t be expected to cope with a huge number of non-English speaking children arriving. This is yet another reason why it is so important to have a limit on immigration and also why we will insist that anyone who comes here from outside the EU to get married needs to speak English.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Americans and Brits, lissen up here!!!  We have done little or nothing to prevent foreigners from entering our countries and usurping our public services.  It isn&rsquo;t too late.  Get organized and stop it NOW!!  The vast majority of legal citizens DO NOT WANT ALIENS in the country who don&rsquo;t speak English - so we need to focus on stopping the immigration (we need the jobs for our legal citizens in THIS economy!) and secondarily on making things so miserable for the foreigners here that they go home voluntarily.  Yes it could get ugly - but what is it now, pretty?  I think not.  We need to start acting up and acting out and get rid of the foreigners we don&rsquo;t need!</p>
