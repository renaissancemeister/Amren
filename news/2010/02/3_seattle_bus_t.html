<h1>3 Seattle Bus Tunnel Guards Watch Brutal Beating</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gene Johnson, Washington Post, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 15-year-old girl who was badly beaten and robbed in a Seattle bus tunnel as three unarmed security guards looked on told investigators that she thought the men would protect her.</p>
<p>The statements were revealed in court papers filed Wednesday against the teen girl accused of attacking her and the three young men accused of stealing her purse, phone and iPod. The four were all charged with first-degree robbery.</p>
<p>The victim told a King County sheriff&rsquo;s detective that the group followed her from a nearby department store into the bus tunnel at Westlake Station on Jan. 28, and she deliberately stood next to the three guards.</p>
<p>The guards didn&rsquo;t intervene, though. They have standing orders to &#8220;observe and report,&#8221; so they called police but did nothing else as another 15-year-old girl punched and repeatedly kicked the victim in the head.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girl, who is black, also told the detective that the altercation began at a nearby department store, where some in the group made threatening comments that she had &#8220;nice things&#8221; and that she acts &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two Seattle police officers noticed the escalating situation and kicked the group out of the Macy&rsquo;s, then brought the girl and her friend to another exit, the victim said. She reported that she asked the officers for an escort to the bus tunnel, just below the department store, but the officers refused.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The victim, who reported that she lost consciousness during the attack, was not hospitalized. She said she has a potentially fatal heart condition, and tried to protect her chest as she was being kicked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girl charged with being the primary attacker faces up to 2 1/2 years in juvenile detention if convicted. Whitaker, 18, and Latroy D. Hayman, 20, each face a sentence of 31 to 41 months in prison if convicted, and the third adult defendant, Tyrone J. Watson, 18, faces a sentence of 36 to 48 months in prison.</p>

		<p>I actually can&rsquo;t blame the security guards, if they were unarmed and had orders to stand down.  That begs the obvious question   &mdash;   If they&rsquo;re unarmed and must stand down, why are they even there to begin with?   Male security guards would have caught flack for touching girls and women, even if they were fighting.</p>
<p>Also, note that black thug types are so desperate for white people to beat up that if they can&rsquo;t find any real white people, they&rsquo;ll find honorary whites among their own to batter.</p>

		<p>This is a non-story. Two thugs hit each other; there&rsquo;s nothing to say about this sort of daily occurence. This one just happened to be taped. And security guards of any race are in a low-paying, low responsibilty, low IQ job. Why should the security thugs break up the girl-thugs?</p>

<p>Personally, I think that the victim of this atrocity gets temporary &ldquo;honorary white status&rdquo; here, for the duration of this ordeal and its outcome. Her primary traits for being targeted were &ldquo;acting white&rdquo; and having &ldquo;nice things,&rdquo; which is saying she got attacked by  members of her &ldquo;own&rdquo; race, since a member of ours wasn&rsquo;t handy for the pack. </p>
<p>To be sure, if she is a white hater herself than who cares about her. But, I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt with the known information.</p>
<p>On a side note, I was wondering what her race was, since I caught the video of this attack on MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Joe&rdquo; today. I figured she was probably a nonwhite and the attackers were also, since no charges of &ldquo;racism&rdquo; was chanted about or bemoaned. Moreover, I was 100% certain that she was not white and the attackers &ldquo;of color,&rdquo; since the video was aired in the first place.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Exactly.  If they had intervened, the liberal media would have been outraged that the racist security guards pepper sprayed/tazed/hit black girls and feminist blogs would be screaming about the guards&rsquo; &#8220;violence against women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, most blacks hate other blacks if they are &#8220;acting white,&#8221; because they despise whites so much.  These feelings are promoted and encouraged within the black community and by black leaders.  </p>
<p>Imagine every black having a Jeremiah Wright instigator give him/her a hate speech almost everyday, and having such anti-white rhetoric echoed in the black communities all over the country.  It creates an army of dumbed down soldiers bent on getting back at whitey, and anybody that acts like him.</p>
<p>A person who should know is Jesse Peterson, black himself, who is an anti-hate advocate.  He teels us&hellip;.as do untold numbers within the black community&hellip;.that blacks are taught that ALL THEIR PROBLEMS are the result of whites somehow.  Whether they fail in school, fail their academic tests or ones for employment, it isn&rsquo;t their fault.  It&rsquo;s because whites want to keep blacks down.</p>
<p>All this kind of hate speech incites blacks to violence against whites, mostly because blacks just aren&rsquo;t bright enough to figure out they&rsquo;re being used by their leadership to create violence, hoping that violence and the threat of violence will result in even more privileges and benefits for blacks.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that the white power structure knows this, but does absolutely nothing about it.  In fact a week rarely goes by that a Michael Dyson or some other black hate-monger isn&rsquo;t on one of the news shows further inciting either the white fools or the black ones&hellip;.or usually both&hellip;..with the same kind of lies.  Of course, dim-witted left wing whites agree with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if both the radical whites and extremist blacks realize that if this carries on any longer there&rsquo;s apt to be armed conflict between whites and blacks?</p>
<p>Surely the government must know this.  But on second thought, they know so little until it&rsquo;s too late this situation is just one of many.</p>
<p>How could they fail to see the sub-prime real estate crash coming when many in the private sector did?   <br>

		<p>The Spanish language media showed the video and you can see the security guards standing and watching  while the attacker kicked the victim who was already on the ground. At one point they were standing not more than five feet away from the beating (it really didn&rsquo;t look like a fight).</p>

		<p>Note that in Seattle, as in all USA cities, states and the Federal level, it is the role of government to hire as many Minorities as possible, even if they serve no function.  </p>
<p>How much does Seattle spend on the Tunnel Guards to stand around and do nothing?  What an incredible waste of taxpayer money.  Yet, at this very moment, some Seattle administrators are claiming it is essential to raise taxes (primarily only on the so-called wealthy) to prevent disastrous cuts to critical social programs. </p>

		<p>Not surprising to me.  A local middle school in my city has had to have a permanent police detachment because rival black gangs have knife fights on their way home. The fighting revolves around two rival neighborhoods of morons. If I had time I would search some of the local news stories since the little gangstas often have amusing names. </p>

		<p> Anyone else notice that the story never mentions that the thugs were black, as well as the victim? Of course, anyone who thought they were White after reading their names would have to have lived under a rock for the last 30 years.</p>
<p> This just points up what we have known for years: &#8220;Acting White&#8221; (that is, striving to excel in school, wishing to go to college as a student and actually learn something, rather than just as an &#8220;athlete,&#8221; hoping to have a career instead of just &#8220;hanging out&#8221;) is the unforgivable sin for a black to commit, in the eyes of many other blacks. &#8220;How dare you show us up as the losers we all are?! We&rsquo;ll make an example of you!&#8221; </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing I don&rsquo;t grok   &mdash;   The victim was battered because she &#8220;had nice things,&#8221; and therefore &#8220;was acting white.&#8221;  You mean blacks, as in the keepin&rsquo; it real crowd, don&rsquo;t like nice things?  Or do they not interpret the kilobuck chrome spinners and kilowatt subwoofer that they simply must retrofit every 1983 Oldsmobile coupe/hooptee they buy for $500 as nice things?</p>

		<p>The security guards are in a no win situation - and probably at little over minimum wage. If they intervene, they will probably get fired and if they are white; charged with a hate crime. Go out to youtube and look up girl fights, most of them involve at least one black. </p>
<p>God forbid that blacks who can achieve be allowed to do so. </p>

		<p>If it had already happened, I would say Blacks richly deserve a separate but equal stance. For whites, a measure of protection from the authorities. But for blacks, &#8216;Goon&rsquo; security guards and &#8216;racist&rsquo; police shouldn&rsquo;t be required to interfere. Give them what they demand. Apparently in this cause (as in many other) they got it.  </p>

		<p>I listened to an interview with the Seattle Sheriff this morning.  He said that the security guards had orders to only observe and take note of any security problems.  They were not employees of the city or county, but apparently of the shopping mall.  But many commentors have already said that even a private citizen would have jumped in and helped someone being ganged up on.  Those guards and the mall managers are going to take a lot of heat.  I have seen the video, the girl was literally beat at the feet of the guards.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how a man, three men, can watch a kid get that beat up within their easy reach.  Three men in uniform should have been enough to stop it, but those kids ran around them and kicked the girl over and over, with no regard to anyone.  One of them raised his hand and seemed to say something when I suppose, he thought the girls life might be in danger.  If this is a new sport, then the victim is entitled to two free kicks at the heads of each of her assailants.  But that is what they looked like, referrees at a sports match.  What idiots, I mean the mall management and the individuals around the incident.</p>

		<p>Here is the money quote: &#8220;they were outnumbered by this pack of people 3-to-1.&#8221;   Had these guards intervened they would have had to fight this whole group.  Seattle was the site of the infamous Mardi Gras lynching a few years ago,  where a pack of racist blacks went about openly beating and robbing whites, specially targeting white women with long hair.   They beat one man to death.  This doesn&rsquo;t happen in a socio-political vacuum, and it&rsquo;s not entirely  coincidence that this sort of thing happens in uber-Liberal Seattle, though it could happen just about anywhere in this country because liberalism rules everywhere.   The idea that &#8220;white power structure knows this, but does absolutely nothing about it&#8221; is naive in the extreme.   They -  cultural elite, the political left - and not black leaders, are the knowing sponsors of it,  the role black thugs play for liberalism is somewhat similar to the role Brownshirts played in the Nazi organization.   These things should be viewed as a sociological whole,  a dance between those in power,  their allies, and their victims, with those in power calling the tunes.  The threat of black racial violence, or violence or intimidation from any other favored group (like homosexuals after the California marriage vote) plays a critical role in liberal rule, it&rsquo;s always right there under the surface,  and the establishment has to strike a balance between maintaining intimidation as a weapon while not letting it get to far out of hand.   Thus in this incident the black muggers will go to jail, the security guards will take the fall,  and no one will talk about the typical threat of black lynch mob violence that lurks in the background of this story and is the ultimate driving force, on several levels, of the security guards lack of action. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Seattle and I have heard about this for several days now.  </p>
<p>All of the kids involved, attackers and victim, are black. </p>
<p>Also three boys assisted with attacking the one girl.  She was not seriously injured according to news reports. </p>
<p>Both of the girls are 15 years old and according to one of the attackers mother, the two girls have fought before over a boy and have been harrassing each other over the internet.  </p>
<p>So it sounds like this was no random crime and the victim may have been running her mouth.  Also not only were the security guards white, but with the girls being underage, if the adult men (guards) would have touched the two girls to break up the fight that would have opened up a whole new set of problems. </p>
<p>Crime is getting more serious in the Seattle area though, and blacks randomly attacking whites (and other blacks) is getting more common.    </p>

		<p>  The sad point is the victim, who apparently did nothing wrong, went first to the police and then stood by men in uniform in the vain hope that the male &lsquo;guardians&rsquo; of our society would protect her.  Note the thugs knew EXACTLY how far they could go and had no guilt about the evil they committed.  An interesting sidelight is that a minority now gets to taste the worthlessness of hate laws – especially when such crimes are committed against the majority.  Utter a single word against a minority while in the commission of a crime and you will instantly be charged with a hate crime.  On the other hand, countless minorities utter hateful and racist comments against whites, but as long as they &lsquo;rob&rsquo; the person they are victimizing, no hate crime is ever charged against them – it was a crime against &lsquo;property&rsquo;.   Hate crimes are worthless, yet crimes against those with &lsquo;property&rsquo; or &lsquo;better education&rsquo; or even the &lsquo;appearance of being white&rsquo; does not rise to the level of uttering the dreaded slang terms for minorities.  This incident reveals how insane and Orwellian our world has become.  How sad that those assigned to protect this poor girl failed miserable to do so.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that video on German TV and was rather shocked by the indifference of the &#8220;security&#8221; men - the victim was writhing literally at their feet and they did absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>The worst offender was a black girl, that was well visible on the surveillance video and the skin of the victim seemed to me definitely lighter. </p>
<p>Of course, the commentary of the German moderator was about the &#8220;youth violence&#8221; in general. Not a single word about race, though.</p>

		<p>Where are her kinsmen? Her father and uncles should have already armed themselves to the teeth and devised a schedule where they could protect her from revenge for the horrible street crime of snitching. In reality she is most likely being raised by a single mother with no familial support structure. One should cock the 357 before dialing the 9-11. If the school can`t take care of your daughter,home school her. Of course you would need a support staff of kin, impossible if you are raised by granny because mommy is out in the clubs or stoned on crack.<br>
     If this had happened in Raliegh County West Virginia, or Harlen County Kentucky, the issue would be over with the perpetrators dead. Of course it wouldn`t have happened there because trash know that revenge is a rifle shot away. I liked the fact the cops wouldn`t escort her to the station.They were working off duty at Macy`s and had other priorities most likely overseeing about 200 cruising black thug teenagers. Isn`t cultural diversity a peach?<br>

<br><br>
I think that if it comes to this, it will be whites armed with rifles and shotguns against colored folks armed with knives, (maybe machetes - see Haiti) pot metal .25 pistols and .22 shorts - ghetto guns. They certainly can kill you in close quarters, but a good man with a rifle can stand off all but a human wave of attackers.<br><br>
<br><br>
And we have the ability to plan for this and communicate and cooperate with each other, which the Bantus generally lack in any significant quantity. Get your neighbors, make a plan including interlocking fields of fire for your riflemen, so none can get through, and you will be OK.<br><br>
<br><br>
Leave yourself in the midst of blacks, or leave yourself unarmed, and you will definitely be out of luck, as will your white liberal friends. They are not coming and staying at MY house if it hits the fan!</p>

		<p>It was only four years ago that I first witnessed my first black/hispanic beat-down.  I had never seen anything like it in my whole life.  When I was a kid, if two kids had beef with each other, they fought man to man and everyone else watched and did not interfere, whether their friend won or lost.  (I was in a few of those fights myself!) Fighting always happened for a reason.  There is a code of honor among whites that you don&rsquo;t find in other cultures (outside of Japan and China).</p>
<p>These kids in the ghetto will just swarm at each other in big melees seemingly at random, and then just as randomly they will disperse.  That first beat down I saw, it was about 15 black/hispanic kids who suddenly decided to beat down a friend for the fun of it.  After everyone piled on kicking and punching for 2-3 minutes, they stepped back like nothing happened.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;A 15-year-old girl who was badly beaten and robbed in a Seattle bus tunnel as three unarmed security guards looked on&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As demographics change and become increasingly non-White, these vicious assaults will escalate  &mdash;  and they WILL be directed at &#8216;rich&rsquo; (read ANY) Whites, while non-White police and security guards stand by (or join in perhaps).  We will be targeted every time we venture out unless we arm ourselves with deadly force.</p>
<p>One more sign of the loss of the Rule of Law and the coming anarchy.</p>
<p>Recently, at a school not far from mine, the principal (an old colleague) told me of a vicious, all-black, all-female fight in one of the classrooms.  She said about four or five girls were involved and it was an all-out, desk breaking melee, worse than a fight between two competing dogs.  School personnel didn&rsquo;t know how to break it up without themselves getting torn apart  &mdash;  and you can bet any of the non-White or male administrators fear the risk of opening themselves up to charges of child and/or sexual abuse.  </p>
<p> The ghetto lottery is alive and well in the schools because the school district is seen in the welfare community as having &#8216;deep pockets&rsquo;  &mdash;  also it&rsquo;s viewed as part of the &#8216;White power structure&rsquo; designed to keep down &#8216;people of color.&rsquo;  And once a child/sexual abuse charge is slapped on an educator, his career is over  &mdash;  even if the charges prove to be false, as is usually the case.  I&rsquo;ve seen how this works many times, seen a number of careers (and educated Whites) completely destroyed by false charges.</p>
<p>Finally, someone called 911 and fortunately, the police responded quickly  &mdash;  and immediately called for back-up!  Two more police cars showed up and six cops arrived and pow-wowed as to how to go about separating these feral animals  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m sure they were pondering whether or how to intervene and whether career-ending child/sexual abuse AND police brutality charges would be filed against them.  Wouldn&rsquo;t the activist lawyers love to get their hands on a suit like that!  Poor &#8216;honors&rsquo; students of color&rsquo; only trying to better their lives and go to college against great odds, are viciously attacked, unprovoked, by the cops in what should be a safe place for children, especially children of color.  I can hear it all now  &mdash;  because I&rsquo;ve heard it so many times before.</p>
<p>The cops finally grabbed the girls by the arms, the more dangerous ones under the arms and threw (this is how it was told to me) them in opposite directions and slapped the cuffs on them.</p>
<p>The next day, of course, charges were filed, one student against another, against the school and school district and (we&rsquo;re sure) against the police.  Whatever the outcome, it will tie up more millions of dollars as the school district and police fight the charges, and there may well be a large payoff to one or more of the students (and the activist lawyer).</p>
<p>None of this would ever make the papers around here as it is not uncommon.</p>
<p>See you at the Del Mar gun show!</p>

		<p>Then, after the beating, no one but an officially licensed paramedic, on duty, and on that exact call, would be able to give her any type of medical assistance, either, or even touch her, again, for fear of a lawsuit or city bankruptcy. Here, even the police couldn&rsquo;t do their police job. Perhaps someone in the &#8216;MSN&rsquo; could have got away with helping her. Or someone wearing a mask, like Zorro.</p>

&#8220;Yes, most blacks hate other blacks if they are &ldquo;acting white,&rdquo; because they despise whites so much. These feelings are promoted and encouraged within the black community and by black leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with that assessment whole-heartedly.  It&rsquo;s spot on. </p>
<p>The only thing I might add is that I&rsquo;m pretty sure all these &#8220;acting white&#8221; denigrations were originally started by the many blacks who realized they couldn&rsquo;t learn on the same level as whites, so they quit trying, using the excuse that they didn&rsquo;t want to &#8220;act white.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But &#8220;acting white&#8221; had nothing to do with their aversion to learning.  That has been used just an excuse to avoid suffering the embarassment of failing.  They don&rsquo;t have the intellect to learn, so they demonize blacks who try for fear they might be left behind in the black community.  The big problem with them is that they just can&rsquo;t learn.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So it sounds like this was no random crime and the victim may have been running her mouth. Also not only were the security guards white,&#8221;</p>
<p>The security guards were white?  Sure they weren&rsquo;t asians, hispanics or light skinned blacks?  I haven&rsquo;t seen a white security guard for about 35 years now, especially working for a government contractor where EEOC, judges etc have forbidden whites to work.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a security guard, also a store clerk.  They are all trained explicitly.  Do not intervene, do not resist, call police, hand over the money.  Bank tellers, parking lot cashiers theater cashiers, all those workers, especially security guards are told:do not touch, do not interfere, just report.</p>
<p>Had they intervened they may very well have been fired.  I remember as a child what happened at a big Sears store near our home.  A clerk attacked a robber and he was shot dead.</p>
<p>And if blacks are touched, both the guard and his employer are in for all sorts of harassment and lawsuits by liberals.  For that reason many of the deep pockets chain stores allow blacks to get away with shoplifting, robbery of patrons in parking lots, and other unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>Big Daddy,<br>
Don&rsquo;t be too sure about the inferior armament of Blacks.  During the &#8220;Rotney&#8221; King riots in LA there was at least one little reported incident where a National Guard armory was breached and a large store of automatic weapons and ammo taken. God only knows how much stuff is &#8220;misplaced&#8221; in military installations across the country.</p>

		<p>I never heard anything about rioters breaking into National Guard armories, but I know that our rifles were stored with the bolts removed.  The bolts were kept in a safe at the local police headquarters.  <br>
     There were about 7000 guns stolen from stores during the LA riots.<br>
     And most of the rioters were Mexicans who had never heard of Rodney King, but saw an opportunity to get free stuff.</p>

		<p>Once, when I was in my late twenties, I interrupted a girl fight before it started.  I could see what was coming as I left a liquor store, a bunch of evil brats egging two girls on, one of whom clearly didn&rsquo;t want to fight but was afraid of being called chicken.  I escorted her from the store to to a female samaritan&rsquo;s car, and was then attacked by several drunk teen aged boys.  I ran like hell and hopped a wall.  The boys were too sloppy to catch me, but I&rsquo;d have been murdered if they had.  <br>
     It is extremely dangerous to confront violent kids, and pointlessly foolhardy to do so without a weapon of some kind.  And if you do smash one of the little monsters, their parents will be all over the prosecutor&rsquo;s office, demanding your head.  <br>
     BTW, all the kids were White.  </p>

		<p>What most amazes me about black violence, besides it senselessness, sheer brutality and randomness, is how sudden and spontaneous it is. Blacks will be seemingly calm one moment and then just explode into an hysterical outburst of violence and brutality. Sometimes it is only verbal like &#8220;going off on someone&#8221;. Sometimes it is a lot more. Blacks are just not like any other people in this way. They are walking time bombs.</p>

		<p>Blacks operate on a different frequency than whites. They are simpley a different animal. There is a code of honor as well as scoundrals in all human types.. but the races ARE different on the inside as well as outside. Secondly: our legal system has swung too far to the left.. in which case, everyone is entitled to extensive legal representation regardless of their inability to supply the funds required and more importantly, of their own deliquency. Thirdly: the major move in this age of aquarius to dismantel the patriarchal white hegemony is the major force behind the anarchy arrising. The white way of doing things has been systematically ridiculed throughout the educational systems on a global level. Some corrections were necessary but in this also, we have thrown out the baby with the bath water. Things never were perfect&hellip; and never will be but we need to bring things more towards the middle where society is sustainable. All things.. said and done&hellip; Smart whites will read the signs, stay to their own and keep their cards close to their chest.</p>

		<p>I have posted this before but feel it bears repeating.  Blacks make up only 8% of Seattle but committed at least half the murders there in 2008, and probably about 75% of the murders there in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/no5knk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/no5knk</a></p>
<p>From the article &#8220;List of 2008 homicides in Seattle&#8221; from the Seattle PI</p>
<p>selected from the list of the 28 Seattle homicides in 2008&hellip;.</p>
<p>Allen Joplin, Jan. 4   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>De&rsquo;Che Morrison, Jan. 10   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Maurice &#8220;Moe&#8221; Allen Jr., Jan. 26   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Degene Barecha, Jan. 30   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Perry Henderson, Feb. 6   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Stephan Dwaine Stewart, April 2   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Eldora Earlycutt, July 4   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>James Paroline, July 10   &mdash;   white killed by black</p>
<p>Troy Peters, July 22   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Pierre Lapoint, Aug. 5   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Jane Kariuki, Oct. 16   &mdash;   woman of unknown race killed by black man named Christel D. Murphy</p>
<p>Quincy S. Coleman, Oct. 31   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>Edward McMichael, the &#8220;Tuba Man&#8221;, Nov. 3   &mdash;   white killed by multiple blacks</p>
<p>Nathaniel Lee Thomas, Nov. 23   &mdash;   black killed by black</p>
<p>So by my count blacks (8% of Seattle) were the killers in at least half (that&rsquo;s at least 50%) of the murders in the Seattle area in 2008. At least five of the other murderers were latinos. </p>
<p>The numbers are actually worse for 2009 and approach if not surpass the 75% mark.   There is an article you can find at the seattlepi.com that is a 2010 version of the above 2009 article.  I have not sat down and parsed it all out as I did above yet, but a quick glance reveals that the numbers are bad.</p>
<p>Of the 27 officers that were shot and killed by criminals in the last 20 years in King and Pierce county, 21 of them were shot by black men, even though black men make up less than 3% of the population of those counties combined.</p>
