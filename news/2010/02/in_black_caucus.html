<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/us/politics/14cbc.html">In Black Caucus, a Fund-Raising Powerhouse</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Lipton and Eric Lichtblau, New York Times, February 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most political groups in Washington would have been barred by law from accepting that kind of direct aid from corporations. But by taking advantage of political finance laws, the caucus has built a fund-raising juggernaut unlike anything else in town.</p>
<p>It has a traditional political fund-raising arm subject to federal rules. But it also has a network of nonprofit groups and charities that allow it to collect unlimited amounts of money from corporations and labor unions.</p>
<p>From 2004 to 2008, the Congressional Black Caucus&rsquo;s political and charitable wings took in at least $55 million in corporate and union contributions, according to an analysis by The New York Times, an impressive amount even by the standards of a Washington awash in cash. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2008, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation spent more on the caterer for its signature legislative dinner and conference  &mdash;  nearly $700,000 for an event one organizer called &#8220;Hollywood on the Potomac&#8221;  &mdash;  than it gave out in scholarships, federal tax records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These include cigarette companies, Internet poker operators, beer brewers and the rent-to-own industry, which has become a particular focus of consumer advocates for its practice of charging high monthly fees for appliances, televisions and computers.</p>

		<p>If native born White American Citizens still were in possession of their country, they would have a historical tradition that called them to automatically band together and boycott any company that supports anti white groups, and stay banded together until the hateful offenders issued the obligatory apologies and sent atonement checks to our charities of choice.   </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even think like that; our enemies do, so we lose everything while they are taking all.</p>
<p>White people are despicable and deserve whatever horrors await our minoritized future.</p>

		<p>And how much money did the Congressional <i>White</i> Caucus receive?</p>
<p>An exclusively black-advocacy group gets a wink and a nod when it comes to shady corporate contributions (or is it blackmail?), yet no equivalent White-advocacy group is permitted to exist at all.</p>
<p>This, students, is called &#8220;equality.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure every white organization that was approached contributed because they didn&rsquo;t DARE not to - if they hadn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;d have been labeled &#8220;racist,&#8221; which we just can&rsquo;t have today, you know.  So the CBC gets its money through intimidating white groups, and said groups kiss the black tail.  Not all that different from the Italian Mafia fundraising methods back in the &#8216;30&rsquo;s, now, is it?</p>

<p>What I am always both disgusted and confused by, is the fact that this gloating and squealing by the left is tolerated!</p>
<p>They seem to think that manipulation of &ldquo;rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;laws&rdquo; is their game only. I think that what we on the &ldquo;hard right&rdquo; must do, if we ever (eventually) do get the chance, is not to forget this arrogance and cruelty. Their &ldquo;nonprofit groups and charities,&rdquo; can and should be outlawed as the subversive and terrorist organizations that they are; after all, isn&rsquo;t that how that game gets played?</p>
<p>Or put another way, what once was &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; dialog and other such nonsense today, can become hate speech tomorrow. </p>
<p>May God Let It Be So!</p>

As with everything black, the CBC isn&rsquo;t self-sustaining; it requires outside money to make it work. As with everything black, if left to do for itself, it would wither and die.</p>

		<p>All the corporate and labor groups who are active in DC do the same. Political Prostitution. It defines American &#8220;civics&#8221;. I can blame  blacks for a lot: eg affirmative action, demands that whites compensate blacks for slavery etc etc. but whites invented this particular whore game. If we don&rsquo;t like it, we have to dump the white whores otherwhise known as &#8220;public servants&#8221;. To quote the late great Elvis, &#8220;thank you very much, thank you very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>I once had a trade show organizer tell me that whenever he planned an event for a black owned company they always focused on the &#8220;big party&#8221; first and foremost. The actual business portion of the show was usually put on the back burner and organized in a last minute rush after the band/food/drinks for the party were complete.</p>

&#8220;Business as usual in Washington. Does anyone really think this behemoth Ponzi-scheme of corruption, back-room deals, special interests, and money can maintain itself forever? All empires eventually fall. The USA will be neither the first nor the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right on, and I would invite everybody to pay closer attention to the business news right now, because we&rsquo;re watching history in the making.  The empire is breaking up.  The game is all but over.  The reign of the special interest racial groups is coming to an end.</p>
<p>The Financial Times is reporting that foreign puchasers of treasury securities is down about 55 billion dollars this year.  This is significant, considering that this &#8220;Ponzi scheme,&#8221; so aptly described by Anon, is beginning to collapse like a house of cards, critically hurt by a lack of consumer spending more so than an inability to borrow money from foreign governments.</p>
<p>Added to increase the seriousness of our present situation,  stimulus money for the states is running out.  Public pension obligations are in danger of being eliminated; jobs are being cut, useless PC school programs and subjects are being cast aside, and those same corporations that have been so sycophantically faithful to blacks are downsizing substantially.  </p>
<p>Comparatively, this would be good news if it ended this year and the recovery the media and feds lied about occurred afterwards, but the situation has a bad news side as well:  The cut backs will accelerate during the next fiscal period and beyond if anything is still standing by then.</p>
<p>And, private business is no better off.  The downsizing by the same corporatons that are so generous to blacks, described above, somehow never did comprehend that their celebrations might be a tad early since their laid off workers aren&rsquo;t going to stimulate anything if they&rsquo;re living on unemployment.</p>
<p>And the black &#8220;fund-raising juggernaut&#8221; will be no more than a bunch of penniless incompetents, just as they&rsquo;ve always been without the empire&rsquo;s false props.  What will they do when crying and whining won&rsquo;t put dollars in their pockets anymore or give them degrees, social benefits and preferences, plus undeserved private positions?</p>
<p>In effect, with a shattering of the empire, what we are witnessing is the beginning of the end of political correctness.  Without all the extra cash that came in during unparalleled growth, the empire&rsquo;s most privleged subjects are not going to be able to maintain their positions, because the money just won&rsquo;t be there to buy their tacit agreement not to riot. </p>
