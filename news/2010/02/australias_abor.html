			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bonnie Malkin, London Telegraph, February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Australian government programme that imposes restrictions on Aboriginies in an attempt to stamp out sexual abuse of children in remote outback towns has been branded racist and ineffective by the United Nations.</p>
<p>In an advance copy of a report to be released next week, James Anaya, the UN special rapporteur on indigenous human rights, expressed grave concerns over the controversial Northern Territory initiative known as &#8220;the intervention&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Anaya found the policy, which was implemented by the previous conservative administration, was incompatible with Australia&rsquo;s human rights obligations and must be urgently changed.</p>
<p>In 2007 John Howard, the former prime minister, suspended the country&rsquo;s Racial Discrimination Act in the Northern Territory to enable his government to send troops and police into more than 70 Aboriginal townships to help curb sex abuse and domestic violence fuelled by &#8220;rivers of grog&#8221;.</p>
<p>The policy included compulsory income management and banned the sale of alcohol and pornography to Aboriginies.</p>
<p>However, many residents of the townships affected by the policy complained bitterly that the new laws stripped them of basic human rights and were discriminatory because they did not apply to Australians of other races.</p>
<p>After touring Aboriginal communities for 12 days last year, Mr Anaya agreed, concluding that the tough new rules had not improved the lives of indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The measures specifically target indigenous people and impair certain rights and freedoms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It does impair self-determination of Aboriginal communities, their ability to make certain choices about how their communities are run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Anaya said there was only limited evidence that the programme had benefited the isolated and impoverished communities it aimed to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to the ban on alcohol, for example, the evidence that I have seen is that there has been an increase in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t speculate why; my point is there is no evidence that the bans have helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aborigines make up about 2 per cent of Australia&rsquo;s population of 22 million and are the country&rsquo;s poorest, unhealthiest and most disadvantaged minority.</p>
<p>Successive governments have spent billions of dollars on community programs, housing and education reforms over the past few decades, but living conditions and education levels for the nation&rsquo;s original inhabitants remain abysmal and the average life expectancy for an Aboriginine is 17 years lower than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Kevin Rudd, the current prime minister, has refused to scrap the controversial policy, but will introduce new rules for income management in July that will not discriminate based on race.</p>
<p>Jessica Walker, spokesman for Indigenous Affairs Minister Jenny Macklin, said the Racial Discrimination Act would also be reinstated.</p>
<p>Mr Anaya will present his report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September. Australia will be given the opportunity to formally respond then.<br>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t that funny.  Here in the states it is &#8220;racism&#8221; when liquor stores are on every corner in &#8220;da hood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just more of the old damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When will whites wake up and just quit even trying to appease these people?</p>

		<p>Australian Aboriginals also have the second lowest average IQ on the planet, only beaten by the pygmy people.  Funny how that isn&rsquo;t mentioned anywhere in this article.  They&rsquo;re treated like children because they&rsquo;re even less intelligent than children.  Having the majority of them drinking petrol and getting abused as a child probably isn&rsquo;t helping much either.</p>

		<p>Australian Aboriginals are one of the very few racial/tribal groups on Earth not to have figured out on their own that human sexuality and pregnancy are linked.  Even today, so I understand, abos are so incapable of learning that the drifters among them will take to sleeping in dry riverbeds, even though riverbeds often become real rivers after some heavy rains, which happens often.  In spite of the frequent news that they drown in the suddenly existing river because they bedded down where the river would flow, many keep on doing it in spite of the obvious risk.</p>

		<p>The sensible solution would be to grant the abos independence in their own contiguous area.  Not scattered reservations like in the US and Canada, but a contiguous, independent nation.  Then, like Brazil does with their natives, ban any Australians from entering Abo territory.  Allow their culture to flourish and develop on its own.</p>

		<p>Included in the intervention are: a provision for withholding fifty percent of welfare payments to be granted as store vouchers,<br>
and widespread bans on consumption of alcohol and pornography.</p>
<p>Aboriginals lived for thousands of years under the strict and unforgiving discipline of nature. I think they can handle a few rules.</p>

		<p>The United Nations has no business trying to tell the sovereign nation of Australia what to do. Australia should tell the U.N. to keep it&rsquo;s pointy nose out of Aussie business. This guy Anaya spends 12 days in the country and lo and behold he&rsquo;s an expert in every facet of Aussie life. Amazing.</p>

		<p>The Australian government (fairly) recently issued an apology to the aboriginies re; &#8216;The Stolen Generation&rsquo; (a very long story&hellip;). When I heard about the unbelieveable rate of child sexual abuse etc in these remote &#8216;communities&rsquo; I said to myself, &#8216;the government better get in there and steal them again!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This sorta sounds like, in a similar way but not exactly so, to the policy the Australians had decades ago now of taking the children of Aborigines from families where there was chronic alcoholism, child abuse, neglect, child rape, and turning the kids of these Aborigines over to white families to raise the kids in decent homes.</p>
<p>This was called the &#8220;Lost Generation&#8221; or &#8220;Lost Kids&#8221; or something like that. Yvonne Goolagong the famous tennis player was one of the children raised by whites. </p>
<p>NOW the Australians had to apologize for the previous policy, now seen as a form of &#8220;cultural genocide&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>They interviewed these Australian case workers and social workers that decades ago made the decision to take the children away from their dysfunctional families and to a person they agreed that what they did at the time was correct, they would do it again, and no regrets.</p>
<p>Why the &#8220;rivers of grog&#8221;?? Some groups of folks just drink themselves to insensibility!</p>

		<p>Mr Anaya was in Australia for 12 days. He did not spend much of that time in the communities affected by the Northern Territory Emergency Intervention. Many of us - Aboriginal and other - who live or work in the affected communities do not agree with his analysis and conclusions. There are many positive aspects of the Emergency Intervention which he has not considered or acknowledged.</p>

		<p>The UN in my mind has absolutely no relevance anymore. { Not that it had much to start with.}<br>
The IPCC fraud has killed off any credibility that still existed.<br>
It&rsquo;s just a bunch of mostly 3rd worlders stirring up as many problems as they can and lying about everything.<br>
Pity the UN has never solved a problem itself.  The problem of course is the organisation itself.  A waste of space that should be disbanded.</p>

		<p>I was never a fan of the Howard Govt but this was a case <br>
of having to do something as these communities had become so dysfunctional..<br>
Like many of us Aussies we really feel its a case of damned if you do and damned if you dont&hellip;.<br>
Probably similar to the situation in the States  with blacks<br>
making all types of unreasonable or outrageous demands </p>
<p>Regarding previous comment about giving abos some type of independence it would probably soon result in an even worse basket case situation on a greater scale,not unlike Haiti.Anyway this is  the main reason Australian govt intervened in the first place in these outback communities<br>
where parents were often in a state of alcohol or petrol induced<br>
stupor and children were being abused by predatory relatives <br>
or others.<br>
 <br>
Yes the political correct gone mad UN should mind its own business.  I can assure you from expereince if you had to live amongst Abos in a rural or urban setting and they were allowed to do as they pleased regarding alcohol etc you would be screaming to get way from them    <br>

		<p>I hate child abuse as much as anyone else.  The problem is that the social justice/diversity people are very selective about whatto embrace, even as they force the rest of us to embrace what we are not comfortable with.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with two young liberal teachers at a professional development conference.  The topic was multiculturalism and such.  There was a recent case in the news about an immigrant from mexico who &#8216;bought&rsquo; a girl from her father for a case of beer and some meat.  The girl was underage.  I asked, &#8220;Shouldn&rsquo;t we respect their culture, after all, it was pointed out in court that this is normal in that part of mexico from where the man came?&#8221;</p>
<p>The liberals were aghast and said that when people come here from other countries, they should adapt to our notions of what is proper.  I caught them on it by pursuing the issue: &#8220;But doesn&rsquo;t multiculturalism say respect all cultures?  Who are we to judge one cultural tradition over another?&#8221;</p>
<p>They objected, and I got them to squirm.  It was great.</p>
<p>I say let us be more supportive of multiculturalism than they are, and that is how we can expose them and rub it in their faces.  This is the secret I wish more people like us would realize.  Get the ACLU, SPLC and others to respect the cultural rights of Aboriginals, who have these things in their culture, and when they object, call them on it, and ask if American white culture should have its value also.</p>
