			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Boxell, Financial Times, February 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An increasing number of British people believe ethnic minorities are integrating well within local neighbourhoods even though most still want a sharp reduction in immigration, a government poll on social attitudes has found.</p>
<p>The latest update of the &#8220;citizenship survey&#8221;, which has sought people&rsquo;s views about community cohesion since 2001, showed that 77 per cent of people thought immigration should be cut, with slightly more than half saying it should be reduced &#8220;by a lot&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those figures will be seized on by anti-immigration lobby groups, who argue that the mainstream political parties remain out of step with the electorate over the issue, with many voters saying it is one of their highest priorities.</p>
<p>However, the survey  &mdash;  conducted for the Department of Communities and Local Government  &mdash;  also showed that 84 per cent of people agreed that their local neighbourhood was a place where people from different backgrounds got on well together, up from 80 per cent in 2005.</p>
<p>The far-right British National party has made some electoral inroads in recent years by stoking up fears that &#8220;ordinary white people&#8221; have become marginalised in the UK. But the survey of 15,000 adults in England and Wales showed that, even among white respondents, 83 per cent of people thought their community was cohesive  &mdash;  up from 81 per cent in the previous year. People living in the most deprived parts of the country were less upbeat, with only 69 per cent believing their community was well integrated.</p>
<p>The 2008-09 survey also showed that negative attitudes towards immigration were not softening. There was a small decrease in the number of people who want to see a big fall in immigration, but the number who want some kind of cut remains stable at more than three-quarters.</p>
<p>Students, better-paid workers and holders of degrees were far more favourable towards immigration than those further down the wage scale and people without qualifications, who often find themselves competing with migrant workers. The issue of immigration is shaping up as a key electoral battleground.</p>
<p>The Labour government argues that its points-based system for non-European Union workers is helping to cut migrant numbers after a period in which it has been accused of operating an &#8220;open door&#8221; policy.</p>
<p>Alan Johnson, the home secretary, has admitted that the government has been &#8220;maladroit&#8221; in addressing the concerns of voters over the issue, with Labour particularly worried about losing core support in its traditional industrial heartlands.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have promised a yearly cap on migrants, although it is unclear how much room they would have to make a reduction given that they will not be able to stop people coming from the EU.</p>
<p>The survey also raises questions about Tory claims that British society is &#8220;broken&#8221;, with nine out of 10 people saying that they &#8220;definitely&#8221; or &#8220;to some extent&#8221; enjoyed living in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The communities department said on Thursday the poll showed &#8220;most people, whatever their origin, feel a strong sense of attachment to their neighbourhood and to Britain&#8221;.<br>

		<p>&#8220;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can tell the bias of the writer of this article by his use of the phrase &#8220;far-right British National party&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is an attempt at damage control by an increasingly desperate government/media machine in the run-up to the elections. They&rsquo;re terrified that the BNP will gain further &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; by getting one or more of their members elected as MPs (members of parliament).</p>
<p>In the opinion of this (thankfully) Ex-Pat Brit, once-Great Britain is going to hell in a hand-basket as it gets colonized out of existence. The same thing is happening all over the Western World and I can only guess that the U.N. is at the back of it.</p>

		<p>I tend to agree with the first comment:</p>
<p>This is an attempt at damage control by an increasingly desperate government/media machine in the run-up to the elections. They&rsquo;re terrified that the BNP will gain further &ldquo;legitimacy&rdquo; by getting one or more of their members elected as MPs (members of parliament).<br>
	<br>
Multiculturalism has always been reserved for the lower classes; the politicians and policy maker who promoted massive immigration don&rsquo;t really want move into dangerous cities so they continue hiding in gated communities. It&rsquo;s the poor whites who have historically been the real victims; trapped in a world shaped by sanctimonious politicians who impose their false values.<br>
	<br>
(People living in the most deprived parts of the country were less upbeat, with only 69 per cent believing their community was well integrated.) one must question those figures.  <br>
	<br>
I&rsquo;d venture those statistics were falsified, whites have become prisoner in their own homes; why should Britain&rsquo;s indigenous population invite other races to live in their Country and be afraid of being attacked assaulted robbed, or raped by those whom they invited?<br>
	<br>
God bless the BNP<br>

		<p>Previously the Labour party, and its allies in the press, insisted that this supposed problem was a chimera, a nonsense, a nonexistent issue. Asylum seekers and immigrants in general do not push their way to the top of the housing list and never have  &mdash;  it is a spiteful, politically motivated fiction along the same lines as the EU banning bananas which are not bent, or too bent; local councils banning Christmas festivals because they are non-inclusive; and the Zinoviev letter. Even as Labour announced its policy, the Guardian was at it again, &lsquo;proving&rsquo;, by way of a survey carried out by that implacably neutral body, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which showed conclusively that no black people were allowed social housing anywhere in Britain, or something. And yet beyond the M25 (and, in the case of Ealing, Tower Hamlets, Lambeth  &mdash;  well within it) everyone knows the truth: that for reasons which are, when you examine them, perfectly logical, incomers get social housing ahead of the indigenous population. </p>

		<p>Mr. James Boxwell of the Financial Times, says that a &#8220;government poll on social attitudes has found&#8221; that students, better-paid workers, and holders of degrees were far more favourable towards immigration than those further down the wage scale and people without qualifications, who often find themselves competing with migrant workers. He just as easily  could be writing about the United States and not Britain. Just substitute the Wall Street Journal for his paper. I&rsquo;ve never taken any polls when I&rsquo;ve visited England but people that I know there are from what we&rsquo;d call the &#8220;upper class&#8221; and they do look down upon  their own countrymen that are not as well off as they and I&rsquo;d be surprised if they know any trademen socially.  Anyway, I&rsquo;d suspect any &#8220;government poll&#8221; whether it was sponsosred by their government or our own.  A lot of the responses too have to be evaluated by the way the questions are formed, but given the class divide in England and the USA, one couldn&rsquo;t expect any difference.  It is their working class and ours that have to put up with the negatives of immigration,, not those who are better off due to their education or other factors.  Just look at the disdain that these Ivy League college professors have for the &#8220;Joe 6-Packs&#8221; here in the good old USA.  I can only give anecdotal experiences I&rsquo;ve had during my life with &#8220;students.&#8221;  One told me as we were drinking together at a bar that while I was in the Army he was going to college.  That was in the 1960&rsquo;s.  It is the same in England as in the USA, if a young guy hasn&rsquo;t any prospects he will join the armed forces to improve his chances by getting the finances to go on to college.  We are not a classless society.  The better off you are, the more<br>
open you are to immigration, affirmative action and other benefits for minorities.</p>

		<p>The data about cohesive and well integrated communities can&rsquo;t be taken at face value. Most citizens can&rsquo;t express their opinions in any coherent manner. People are rarely exposed to contrary opinions in the MSM but instead get a steady diet of celebration and joy over the benefits of diversity. It&rsquo;s almost against the law to say immigration is harmful to existing communities. </p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t invite them. The immigrants are uninvited guests. A tiny minority at the top invited them, against the express wishes of the vast majority of the population, and we, the majority, will suffer because of it.</p>

		<p>Taxpayers are paying £73million to house and feed failed asylum seekers who should have been deported - a huge leap from the £4million spent just four years ago. Ministers have admitted the increase is due to the huge backlog of failed claimants, who cannot be removed despite judges ruling they have no right to stay here. Immigration Minister Phil Woolas has now blamed lawyers for the rise, saying they were &#8216;frustrating&rsquo; the Government&rsquo;s efforts to deport failed asylum seekers. He said many were &#8216;paralysing&rsquo; the asylum process by arguing that their clients cannot be returned to their homelands because of conflict or because they are unwell. But the Refugee Council, which provides advice to asylum seekers, has hit back, saying the Home Office was running a system that is &#8216;under-resourced&rsquo; and plagued with &#8216;administrative problems&rsquo;.  The shocking Government figures were revealed by Mr Woolas in a parliamentary answer to Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Teather. They show that, in the financial year 2007/08, about 9,365 failed asylum seekers received £73million in accommodation and food allowances - about £8,000 a year or £150 a week for each claimant. A spokesman for the Home Office admitted that the number of failed asylum seekers claiming assistance had more than doubled from 5,180 in 2004/05 to 10,850 by the first quarter of this year. But he insisted the rise was due to failed claimants becoming more aware they are entitled to receive benefits under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. It states that those who can prove they are destitute can claim free accommodation and £35 a week in food vouchers. Although the support is meant to be temporary, in reality most who qualify will continue to receive it as their lawyers engage in protracted legal battles against their removal. Mr Woolas said: &#8216;A large proportion of those on Section 4 support have exhausted all rights of appeal  and should return home, but their lawyers are continuing to frustrate and delay removals, playing the system and offering false hope.&rsquo; However, a spokesman for the Refugee Council said: &#8216;The Home Office asylum process is extremely under-resourced and it has real administrative problems that have caused the backlog of removals.&rsquo; Damian Green, Tory immigration spokesman, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s simply not good enough for Ministers to blame lawyers for the shambles in the whole system. The Government needs very urgently to do something about the rising cost.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the British journalist, Rod Liddle (who writes for The Sunday Times and The Spectator) putting in an appearance on American Renaissance (as &#8220;#4 Anonymous at 7:12AM&#8221;, although he appends his name at the foot of his post). I don&rsquo;t doubt for one moment that the authorship of this post is genuine, since it is written in Liddle&rsquo;s characteristic style.</p>
<p>Before regular AmRenners pounce on him, I think it necessary to point out that he&rsquo;s writing in a sort of code, since he would be thrown out of the NUJ (and therefore become unemployable in his chosen profession) were he to make his real feelings on multiculturalism and mass immigration too explicit. I would deduce that the &#8220;perfectly logical reasons&#8221; he refers to (for giving recent immigrants priority in social housing) are these: New Labour sees them as potential future voters who will displace the disenchanted indigenous white working class. This latter group either doesn&rsquo;t vote any more, or - increasingly - votes BNP. On prudential - if not moral - grounds this makes perfect sense for New Labour.</p>
<p>Incidentally, to &#8220;#2 Anonymous at 7:56PM&#8221; I would point out that we - the indigenous British (and especially English) populace -  did NOT &#8220;invite&#8221; the immigrants; our elites did without ever consulting us or seeking our consent.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely confused.  Over the past several years I&rsquo;ve seen poll after poll showing that large majorities of the British people want to see significant restrictions on immigration.  Yet, they continue to vote for the same people who have no intentions of closing the gates.  I don&rsquo;t care how marginalized the BNP is, they should be getting more than 4-5% of the vote.  Even just the people who vote BNP out of anger and protest should be giving the BNP 15-20% vote.  Something is not adding up.  Either the mainstream parties in the UK are campaiging hard against immigration and I&rsquo;m not hearing about it or there are serious questions about the integrity of the voting process in the UK.</p>

		<p>Anonymous wrote at 1:28 AM re BNP &amp; elections.<br>
The BNP won seats in the European Parliament by gaining sufficient votes to trigger automatic representation. They are most effective in local elections, usually held on the death or resignation of the sitting MP and fought on local issues, as it should be. They do not have sufficient personnel or the required funding to contest every seat in a general election, as the one to be held in the next few months, or perhaps they WOULD win more votes. The main 3 parties, labour, conservative and liberal democrats have the wherewithal to do this. The minor parties, especially the BNP, can&rsquo;t do it. The main problem is the continual harassment of the BNP by claiming nazi associations. There are many who would vote BNP if they were given a fair crack of the whip but there are standing instructions within the MSM and BBC never to mention the BNP without including negative and hostile comments and to deny them interviews or positive coverage. Any public meetings are threatened with riots by muslims and communists to the extent that the police refuse to permit the meeting on the basis of a breakdown of public order. Cue the AMREN conference&hellip; exactly the same situation, and exactly the same organisations causing the problem. So, UKIP (united kingdom independence party) was put together with finance from the main parties simply to take votes from the BNP. UKIP have identical policy statements to the BNP, including those on restricting immigration, but they are kept &#8216;clean&rsquo; and never given negative coverage. So, the net result is that many &#8216;moderate&rsquo; BNP votes are hijacked by UKIP who have no chance whatsoever of making a real genuine difference. The recent membership rules change forced on the the BNP by the black and ethnic minority riddled office of &#8216;human rights&rsquo;, a labour government QUANGO, financed by the taxpayer, deliberately and effectively drained the coffers of the BNP fighting the change and so denied them the funds to contest seats in the general election. But all is not lost. Slowly the BNP will grow and financial support will increase. Any and all support from across the pond would be gratefully received.</p>

<p>A &#8220;points-based system&#8221; only means the aliens are smarter, not any less alien.  Such people cause more trouble in universities than they ever could in breadlines.  &#8220;Points&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t helped Canada much, has it?</p>
<p><i>&hellip;with nine out of 10 people saying that they &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; or &ldquo;to some extent&rdquo; enjoyed living in their neighbourhood.</i></p>
<p>Just because white flight puts you in a more comfortable place doesn&rsquo;t mean white flight is any less tragic.  Ask any émigré.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of the US Congress: everybody hates Congress because Congressmen are so corrupt.  But they <i>love</i> their own Congressman because&hellip; he&rsquo;s so corrupt!</p>
