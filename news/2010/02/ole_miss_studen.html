<h1><a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/35551589/ns/sports/">Ole Miss Students Vote to Replace Colonel Reb</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Shelia Byrd, NBC Sports, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>University of Mississippi students voted Tuesday for the school to pursue a new mascot to replace Colonel Reb, the goateed Southern gent banished from the sidelines nearly seven years ago as the school continued its move away from symbols of the Old South.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s Associated Student Body released the results of the online election after voting ended at 5 p.m. CST.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wasn&rsquo;t about Colonel Reb at all. This is a new body of students. This vote is about deciding that we need a new personification of what a Rebel is,&#8221; said John Kaiser, the Associated Student Body&rsquo;s deputy attorney general of elections.</p>
<p>Students were asked to vote &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; on whether they support &#8220;a student-led effort to develop and propose a new &#8216;on-field&rsquo; mascot to represent the Ole Miss Rebels.&#8221; A &#8220;no&#8221; vote meant the school would have remained without a mascot.</p>
<p>The school has more than 18,000 students, but only 3,366 votes were cast. The referendum passed with nearly 75 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ole Miss will remain the Rebels, but Colonel Reb won&rsquo;t be back on the field.</p>
<p>The university has taken other steps in recent years to throw off what many perceive as lingering reminders of a Confederate past. Last year, the band stopped playing the fight song, &#8220;From Dixie With Love,&#8221; to discourage fans from chanting, &#8220;the South will rise again.&#8221; In 1997, the school ended the waving of Confederate flags at sporting events.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Loy [Hannah Loy, a senior political science major and a member of the Colonel Reb Foundation] said her generation should be allowed to define issues of race and school spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the older generations need to stop pressing their feelings about race and what happened in the past on those of us who weren&rsquo;t even alive then,&#8221; Loy said.</p>
<p>The Colonel Reb Foundation, a group formed in 2003 when the mascot was dropped, had bought advertisements in the student newspaper in hopes of winning a &#8220;no&#8221; vote on the proposal.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s slated to replace Colonel Reb.</p>
<p>After all, it is so out of place to have a visage of an old white man with a white beard walking with a cane and suggestively being a plantation owner as the mascot of the premier state university in a state where old white men with white beards who walked with canes used to own plantations.</p>

<p>How fitting. The civil rights activists of the 1960&rsquo;s are now the establishment, and they&rsquo;re getting a taste of what it&rsquo;s like to have a younger generation challenge and reject what they regard as sacred.</p>

		<p>In the name of progress(ivism), Col. Reb should be replaced by a statue of Mario Savio, or perhaps Stokely Carmichael.  Or what about Gus Hall, that sad and forlorn old Stalinist whose tireless work on behalf of consigning most of America to the Gulags?</p>
<p>Of course, Obama may one day qualify as a true progressive, but we&rsquo;ll have to see if he can truly establish his bona-fides by destroying the American economy and putting us firmly in the communist camp.  </p>
<p>But no doubt of it.  The Colonel must go.  He&rsquo;s a hopeless anachronism, a throwback to the desire of the south to be free and independent.</p>

<p>While I believe that Ms. Loy is a seriously misguided and ignorant youngster, the surname Loy is not Chinese; it&rsquo;s French.  I know - my grandmother is a Loy, and I assure you that we are not Chinese. Neither was Myrna Loy</p>
<p>Hannah Loy in this article is probably just another White college student duped by the media and years of liberalism. </p>

		<p>I just did a google image search, and came up with a Hannah Loy in a Tiara, holding a Scepter.  And definitely white.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had any use for Ole Miss or its graduates (they tend to be idealists who drink a lot: we&rsquo;re reality-based teetotalers).  And their voting to HAVE a mascot, when they had the rare privilege of being WITHOUT one of those tacky things, just deepens my contempt for the school.</p>
<p>So what will the new mascot be?  A Communist wannabe, dressed in whatever the kids at truly hip schools were wearing ten years ago&hellip;Bourbon &amp; Coke in one hand&hellip;cigarette in the other?</p>
<p>Images of Colonel Reb did nothing for me to enhance my view of the Confederacy.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  It reduced the real heroism of those beautiful people to a sleazy caricature.  So, I say GOOD RIDDANCE: but not for the reasons the SPLC and NAACP would hope.</p>

		<p>That is right. Forget about the history of Mississippi and good ole day of state&rsquo;s rights. Forget the Colonel. Forget the Confederate flag. Replace the colonel with some multi-cultural symbol. Remindes me of the movie PCU. This is political correctness has gone to far. We can&rsquo;t do anything to celebrate our past without offending people. Too much already.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious. If the powers that be insist on ridding the school of its widely-recognized historical mascot, then the students might as well just make a joke out of the entire situation. The Admiral would get my vote. <br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether this kind of thing is planned or if it&rsquo;s just a boggling coincidence.</p>
<p>Take the name Ackbar and make it a character in Star Wars. Get our children accustomed to it, let it develop a positive connotation by its association with a widely viewed/loved movie.<br>
And it will become a shoo-in candidate for acceptance in any popularity contest. In this case, the new mascot&rsquo;s name. It seems so innocent, just a fantasy character&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>But, isn&rsquo;t Allahu Akbar the final words of many suicide bombers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a tiny chip in our defenses, but insidious. Once we&rsquo;re inured to a little we tolerate even more until it&rsquo;s too late to wake up.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just paranoid.</p>

<p>Ironic that a poster using the handle Francois didn&rsquo;t recognize a French name or remember the beautiful, white actress, Myrna Loy.  What this demonstrates is the disconnect many conservative American whites have with the very cultures they proclaim to represent and defend.  Lack of actual European, historical and cultural knowledge is often demonstrated on these commentary pages by habitual posters.  This contributes greatly to the impractical and/or dearth of real solutions so rarely suggested.<br>

I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re a Mississippi State fan?  If so, it&rsquo;s no wonder you failed to mention this.  I really don&rsquo;t understand the contempt for Ole Miss students.  Trust me, Ole Miss students are far from &#8220;Communist wannabes.&#8221;  Ole Miss probably has the most right-wing student body of any public school in the country.  When I was a student a few years ago, we got to vote (non-binding) on whether we wanted to keep Colonel Reb as the mascot.  Something like 97% of students voted yes.  </p>
<p>Ole Miss has a beautiful campus and a great student body.  However, it is staffed by some of the most radical, hateful professors imaginable.  Nearly every professor I had while I was there openly expressed their hatred for everything white and Southern.  There was practically no interaction between students and professors.  Not a week went by when some professor didn&rsquo;t write a letter to the editor of the school newspaper complaining about students&rsquo; behavior, stating how backwards we all were, or complaining about a left-wing bumper sticker being ripped off their car.  When AmRen ran an ad in the student paper with the picture of a white child and the headline &#8220;Will she be a minority by the time she is 40?&#8221;, one of my professors actually held the ad up in class and told us that she hoped white people would become minorities because it would be good for us to know what it felt like.</p>

		<p>  As an Ole Miss alum, I  will confide that I was never that taken with the Colonel Rebel mascot, due primarily to the buffonish antics performed by whatever kid was chosen from year to year to wear the costume. I much preferred the older mascot, which was a male student dressed in a confederate calvary officer&rsquo;s uniform, similar to Notre Dame&rsquo;s leprechaun. The band then was similarly dressed in gray confederate army uniforms. Colonel Rebel was actually a subtle bow to political correctness, a change made in the 70&rsquo;s from the old, more overtly confederate themed symbols. Liberalism, or more accurately, cultural marxism, are nothing if not relentless, and the names &#8220;Ole Miss&#8221;, reminiscent of the nickname slaves often gave to the plantation owner&rsquo;s wife, and &#8220;Rebels&#8221;, will doubtlessly be the next targets of the various grifters and sellouts striving to establish their politically correct bona fides. I suggest we get ahead of the curve. Change the name of the school&rsquo;s sports teams to the &#8216;Mississippi Marxists&#8221;, then take the hat off of Colonel Rebel and rename him &#8220;Comrade Lenin&#8221;-he already has the trademark moustache and goatee!</p>

		<p>Once again, and I have spoken of this many  times, I condemn the people of Mississippi along with the Alumni and White/Southern students for not taking measures to stop this.  I&rsquo;ve said that all that needs to be done is for Ole Miss fans to STAY AWAY FROM EVERY SPORTING EVENT in protest!  As I&rsquo;ve said before, these traitors running the school and the athletic departments only understand two things; MONEY AND POWER.</p>
<p>Therefore, a few EMPTY stadiums and colliseums will do the trick nicely. Simply state your demands, and vow to stay away from any games and cease all monetary support until your demands are met.</p>
<p>I PROMISE you, that will do the trick!  However, I suppose Mississippians are so used to getting their collective rears kicked by blacks and white Leftist activists that they&rsquo;ve grown used to it and figure capitulation to the enemy destroying their culture and rubbing it in their faces is worth it.  Sure can&rsquo;t miss any Football or Basketball if it means defending their culture and rights.</p>

		<p>Nationalist Without a Nation,</p>
<p>I was perhaps a bit harsh in my language about Ole Miss.  I&rsquo;m glad to hear that today&rsquo;s students are Conservative.  But my impression is that the Ole Miss idea of &#8216;Conservative&rsquo; is &#8216;Republican&rsquo;: more about tapping into a spoils system and a superficial heritage than about anything else.  The Republicans seem almost as eager to sell out Old Stock Americans as are the Democrats.  I hope that you are right about the student body, and I am wrong.  It seems we agree entirely on the subject of the professors and administrators.</p>
<p>The Ole Miss grads I know are mostly Jackson attorneys, who strike me as being SPLC types: reeking of &#8220;Southern Culture&#8221;, but essentially liberal&hellip;straight out of &#8216;To Kill a Mockingbird&rsquo;.  And, I know a few physicians who went there, and a few young people who are/were students there.  They all seem to present a rather uniform attitude, that other Mississippians are ignorant racists&hellip;unlike themselves, who are benevolent ruling-class folk (who just happen to live in gated communities and send their children to private schools&hellip;but not because of race, you know).  Again, I hope that your perception is more accurate than mine.</p>
<p>My undergrad degree is from Tulane, since you ask, and I am not a &#8216;fan&rsquo; of any school (I assume you refer to rooting for teams).  In fact, I supported the initiative to remove the whole semi-pro athletics program from Tulane: mostly because it brought violent, stupid criminals into the school, who otherwise would not be there.</p>
<p>Oh, and P Norman, please do not condemn &#8216;The People of Mississippi&rsquo; for anything that goes on at &#8216;The University of Mississippi&rsquo;.  The school and its grads are quite distinct from the rest of the state.  And there are two other big &#8216;Football Schools&rsquo; in the state: so the fan base for its athletic program is more restricted than you may be imagining.</p>

<p>I find one of the problems is we are so often simply reacting to what the anti-white forces have to say (it puts one in good company no doubt) but in a sense, it&rsquo;s accepting the battle on their terms and letting them determine the conditions of the debate, such as it is. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they even allowed the name &#8216;Rebels&rsquo; to remain. After all, it IS an offensive reminder of slavery, right? No wonder it&rsquo;s become virtually illegal to offend anyone - people are so thin-skinned now that offending them would be fatal.</p>

What this demonstrates is the disconnect many conservative American whites have with the very cultures they proclaim to represent and defend&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actually, François is my first name, Whiteplight. I don&rsquo;t live in the US: I live in Québec City, canada, where the vast majority of peope speak French.</p>
<p>I am a student of the Chinese martial art of kung fu, of which there are about 300 diffrent styles in existence. One of those styles is called Loy Gar, the defensive art of the Loy clan. So I thought Ms Loy was of Chinese descent. </p>
<p>As for Loy being a French surname, I must say that I am of French descent, and French is my native tongue, and I honestly have never met anyone whose name was Loy, in the entire province of Québec. Perhaps it is a rather rare surname, that can be heard in some regions of France, though. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I must add that I had never heard of Myrma Loy before. Are you absolutely positive, that she&rsquo;s a French actress?</p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. I am of French descent, but I&rsquo;m Canadian. I live in Québec. I&rsquo;ve never met anyone named Loy, in Québec. It&rsquo;s probably a surname that can be heard in France, though.</p>
<p>Loy can also be a transcription of the name of one Chinese family or clan. I practice the Chinese art of kung fu, of which there are about 300 styles. One of those styles, is called Loy Gar, the defensive art of the Loy clan. So I assumed Ms Loy was of Chinese descent.</p>
<p>Sorry for the mistake.</p>
