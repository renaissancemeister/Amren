<h1><a href="https://www.cis.org/Camarota/WelfareUseByImmigrants">Welfare Use By Immigrant- and Native-Headed Households with Children</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven A. Camarota, Center for Immigration Studies, February 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 2008, 53 percent of all households headed by an immigrant (legal or illegal) with one or more children under age 18 used at least one welfare program, compared to 36 percent for native households with children. Immigrant use of welfare tends to be much higher than natives for food assistance programs and Medicaid. Use of cash and housing programs tends to be very similar to natives. A large share of the welfare used by immigrants is received on behalf of their U.S.-born children. But even households with children comprised entirely of immigrants still have a welfare use rate of 47 percent.</p>
<p>The above figures come from an analysis of the public use file of the March 2009 Current Population Survey collected by the Census Bureau. The survey asks about use of welfare programs in the calendar year prior to the survey. The eight major welfare programs reported above are SSI (Supplemental Security Income for low-income elderly and disabled), TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), WIC (Women Infants and Children food program), free school lunch, food stamps (now called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid (health insurance for those with low incomes), public housing, and rent subsidies.</p>
<p>High immigrant welfare use is partly explained by the low education level of many immigrants. Of immigrant households with children, almost one in three is headed by someone who did not graduate high school, compared to one out of ten for native headed households with children. Most of the immigrant households accessing the welfare system have at least one person who worked during 2008. However, because such a large share of immigrants have relatively little education, their incomes tend to be low and they or their children still qualify for one or more welfare programs.</p>
<p>Although most new legal immigrants are barred from using certain welfare programs for the first five years, this provision has only a modest impact on household use rates for several reasons: most immigrants have been in the U.S. for longer than five years; the ban only applies to some programs; some state governments provide welfare to new immigrants with their own money; by becoming citizens, immigrants become eligible for all welfare programs; and perhaps most important is that the U.S.-born children of immigrants (including those born to illegal immigrants) are automatically eligible for all welfare programs at birth.</p>
<p>Examining welfare use by household is very common among researchers. See for example figures 20-1, 20-2, and 21-3 in Census Bureau publication &#8220;Profile of the Foreign-Born Population&#8221; and &#8220;Immigration and the Welfare State: Immigrant Participation in Means-Tested Entitlement Programs&#8221; by George Borjas and Lynette Hilton.<br>

		<p>They sure do love our White,tax-dollars; moreover, I wonder how long-as Hispanics become the majority-will we tolerate to fund this limited, antagonistic, and savage race. A tax revolt?  Then what?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the low educational level of many immigrants&hellip;&#8221;?  Did you know that compulsory education in Mexico ends after the SIXTH grade???  So an &#8220;educated&#8221; Mexican in Mexico is an uneducated ignoramus in the U.S.A., which simply shows that Mexico is currently failing to educate its people by 21st - or even 20th or 19th - century standards of civilized countries.  No wonder they come here - wow, free education, twice as much as they get at home!  To say nothing of the free breakfasts and lunches their kids get because their immigrant mom is sucking the resources of legal U.S. citizens dry&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I can relate a case in which I have first hand knowledge. A young man came to America from Vietnam about 20 years ago. In short order he petitioned his elderly mother and his three sisters, the last of which, a sister and her husband and son arrived about 5 years ago. He got the county to provide a 1 room apt. for his mother, even though she lived with him, this went on for several years until they got the county to upgrade the apt to a new $2000mo condo, free food they pick up each week, and pay one of his sisters $12hr. to take care of his mother (btw I should mention the son owns 2 $750,000 homes and he and his wife make $150k/yr.) The 2nd sister was earning $60k-$80Kyr up to the end of 2008, but she only reported $10k/yr to the IRS she is paid under the counter, plus lots of tips. the 3rd sister and husband collect the full array of benefits, housing, food, medi-cal, welfare etc. even though they both work full time under the counter. <br>
This story is typical, the hiding of income is common in the service businesses that attract vietnamese, the standard practice is for shop owners to pay employees 50%cash 50% check and grossly under report tips, saving everyone a lot in taxes. I doubt the practice is limited to the vietnamse.</p>
<p>The other day a San Francisco paper ran a story about the demographics of homebuyers in california, they marveled about how the vietmanese were the largest group of buyers. If they did a little more research they could have uncovered the reason why.</p>

		<p>&#8220;High immigrant welfare use is partly explained by the low education level of many immigrants.&#8221;<br>
that may be partly true, but the main reason is they know how to game the system and have no shame about doing it. when they arrive they locate themselves with in their little community and there is no shortage of welfare scammers more than willing to teach them the ropes, along with immigrants rights groups more than happy to sign them up and &#8220;advocate&#8221; for the new arrivals. I&rsquo;m guessing these groups get paid by some govt. program to provide these services, so the US tax payer takes a double hit.</p>

		<p>Welfare agencies in NJ are required to hire bi-lingual caseworkers.  Some county offices are rquired to hire both bi-lingual caseworkers and interpreters.  And guess the language required?</p>

		<p>This has got to stop.  The illegal immigrant population among others, are bankrupting the country.  This handout mentality is simply a way of life for them. They feel no embarassment or shame for leaching off responsible, hard working Americans.  </p>
<p>Every year our company supplies an elementary school located directly across from us, with books, backpacks, coats, pencils and pens etc.  I see the children and their parents everyday from my office window.  The children are beautifully groomed, clothed and well-nourished.  Their parents have nicer cars, and dress better than I do.  Why they are so lazy and feeble, that they are unable to buy some paper and pencils from a dollar store, and prepare a sack lunch for their kid to take to school, is beyond me.  I also can&rsquo;t understand why they do not have the courage and fortitude to confront their own corrupt governments for their rights and a better way of life.  </p>
<p>While their &#8220;En La Manana&#8221; attitude is charming, it is incompatible with the industrious, go getter American way of life.</p>
<p>Folks, please don&rsquo;t forget to vote in the upcoming elections.  Let&rsquo;s take back our country.</p>

		<p>When are we going to see an article about the fact that the elderly relatives of Asian and Filipino business owners and professionals are all on Social Security, disability and Medicare even though they never worked a day in their lives under those programs.</p>
<p>Americans must work for 40 quarters or 10 years to qualify for medicare and social security but immigrants get those programs even though they never contributed a penny to those programs.</p>
