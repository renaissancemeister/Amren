<h1>GOP Hopes to Capitalize on Latino Disappointment With Obama</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Hotakainen, Miami Herald, February 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the president carried the Latino vote by large margins 15 months ago, many Republicans are out to capitalize on Latino dissatisfaction with Obama and Washington&rsquo;s Democratic leaders. They think that could help them immensely in the 2010 elections.</p>
<p>Republican candidates will gain ground from Latinos once Latinos realize &#8220;that what the Democrats offer is just a bunch of empty promises,&#8221; said Hector Barajas, a communications consultant for the California State Senate Republican Caucus.</p>
<p>He noted that the president spent only about 10 seconds on immigration at the very end of his State of the Union speech last month. Barajas said the issue had been particularly hot on Spanish talk radio ever since Obama gave that speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jaime Regalado, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute, a nonprofit public-policy center at California State University, Los Angeles, said Democrats, particularly the president, faced &#8220;a scary situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really a colossal hassle for the administration, that there is so much impatience from so many groups  &mdash;  including Latinos  &mdash;  that are hell-bent on having an immigration reform package in 2010, an election year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s difficult in any season in any year, but this is a very precarious year for Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regalado said Republicans were exploiting the issue &#8220;with good reason,&#8221; because it was a no-win situation for Democrats: They lose votes from Latinos if they don&rsquo;t come up with a comprehensive solution to immigration, or they lose votes from more conservative members of their base if they do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latinos are gearing up to be big players this fall. Earlier this month, a report by America&rsquo;s Voice, a group that backs new comprehensive immigration policies, said that immigration could be the deciding factor in as many as 40 congressional races in November.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Democratic Party needs to wake up and realize that you can only fool the Latino community for so long,&#8221; Barajas said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a great sense of frustration, there&rsquo;s a great sense of anger and there&rsquo;s a big letdown&#8221; that will drive more Latinos to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Regalado said he didn&rsquo;t believe that Democrats would switch to the Republican Party in big numbers. &#8220;What it does threaten is that Latinos stay home&#8221; on Election Day, he said.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Regalado said Republicans were exploiting the issue &ldquo;with good reason,&rdquo; because it was a no-win situation for Democrats: They lose votes from Latinos if they don&rsquo;t come up with a comprehensive solution to immigration, or they lose votes from more conservative members of their base if they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>There must be a great deal of anxiety in black Democrat ranks about how this will affect their balance of power in the coalition.  It will pretty much devastate the number of black Congressman in heavily Latino districts were their constituents couldn&rsquo;t vote before because they weren&rsquo;t citizens.  It also means a bigger share of the &#8220;gubmint&#8221; money going to hispanics.  The Republicans won&rsquo;t fare any better especially with this being an election year and their base is angry.    </p>

		<p>What is making Latinos angry about Obama is that he hasn&rsquo;t yet pushed through an amnesty for them (although he&rsquo;ll no doubt try within the next year).  So now we turncoat Republicans trying to get the Latino vote by promising them an amnesty.</p>
<p>No party *ever* tries to get the white vote.<br>

		<p>I find it revolting that certain Republicans see an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; in pandering to Hispanics.  While Hispanics at least have a greater potential for becoming law-abiding and productive citizens than do blacks, they&rsquo;re firmly in the Democrat corner for the foreseeable future, and no amount of Republican pandering to them will change that.</p>
<p>The Republicans win when they act like the party of small and limited government.  Every time they try to out-Democrat the Democrats they get their rears kicked, and deservedly so.</p>

		<p>Nothing new here.  The GOP went down to a well-deserved defeat by chasing the elusive chimera of &#8220;The Latino Vote.&#8221;  And yet one hears not a whisper about seeking out the <i>White</i> vote.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is Extreme Socialism and White-hating.  The Republican Party is Extreme Socialism and White-hating Lite.  Neither of them care a bit about either White people or the American Constitution.</p>
<p>Time for a third party.  No, it won&rsquo;t win any elections the first time around, or the second, or maybe even the third.  But it will grow, and in the meantime sap votes from those who despise us.<br>

<p>Good, stay home and let U.S. citizens elect their representatives.  We don&rsquo;t want illegals and their sympathizers (some, but not all &#8220;Latinos&#8221;, plus liberal whites) voting in our elections.</p>

		<p>So, what&rsquo;s new?  Republicans will bow down to the Hispanic vote and to the illegal aliens as they did in the 2008 election.  I&rsquo;m not impressed.  We do need a third party, though it may take awhile for it to be successful.  We need a party that truly represents conservative White Americans.  We need legislation that will send all illegals and their anchor babies back home.  There&rsquo;s no logical or constitutional reason for this invasion across our Southern borders.</p>

		<p>Probably the biggest impetus for the formation of the Tea Party movement has been illegal immigration.  Virtually no one in federal office will even address the concerns of Americans who want to actually do something constructive to remedy the problem.  Nuts-and-bolts Democrats want more Latinos because they believe they will ultimately swell their voting ranks, and fiscally conservative Republicans want cheap labor.  And, of course, both parties are afraid of losing the Hispanic vote, which apparently is comprised largely of people who put national origin before citizenship and patriotism.  Most pols in DC want to fix the problem by just legalizing everyone  &mdash;  sort of like decriminalizing murder so that all the murderers can be set free.  <br>
The American people simply must do something to stop this madness.  But a third party, in all probability, will only drive a wedge between conservatives and put Obama and his ilk back in office.  The best we can probably do is to elect primary candidates who speak strongly against illegal immigration and then hold their feet to the fire if elected in the general.  White people must VOTE!!  Too many people don&rsquo;t, and look at the results!</p>

		<p>Even if all the Hispanics &#8220;staying home&#8221; were genuine conservatives, they are still conservatives in the context of their culture, which is by most measures incongruous with ours.  There is no opportunity for the Republicans here, just self-delusion.  The GOP would have to retool itself into a multicultural entity, becoming Democrats all but in name.</p>
<p>Bad omen:  The three-day CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) annual confab in Washington got off to a rousing start this morning when Florida Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio electrified the crowd, playing up his immigrant roots.  Why not instead play up his American identity?  This is a question that Newt Gingrich and other GOP leaders would rather avoid.</p>

		<p>@10 Seek..I was just going to comment on Rubio as well.  For those that missed it, Rubio&rsquo;s &#8220;keynote&#8221; CPAC speech was in essence, a ball of fluff: repetitive, devoid of substance, and so full of the word &#8220;change&#8221; that at times I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the radio had magically switched stations to one on which Obama was speaking.  The same tired mantra of how great this country is, &#8220;inspirational&#8221; stories about his father, and nary a clue as to what he is going to do to make things better.  The Republican party is lost.</p>
