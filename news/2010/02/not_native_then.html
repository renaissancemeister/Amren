<h1><a href="https://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2515716">Not Native? Then Leave Reserve, Mohawks Say</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Wilton, Canwest News Service, February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Kahnawake reserve on Montreal&rsquo;s South Shore has issued eviction notices to 25 residents, saying they are not native enough to remain there.</p>
<p>About 25 non-natives  &mdash;  mostly white people involved in relationships with Mohawks  &mdash;  are being asked to leave the reserve within 10 days because Mohawk law does not allow them to live in the community, said Joe Delaronde, spokesman for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are people with no native ancestry at all,&#8221; Mr. Delaronde said in an interview yesterday. According to Mohawk law, non-aboriginals have no residency rights.</p>
<p>About 7,500 Mohawks live on the reserve.</p>
<p>Band council chiefs began hand-delivering the strongly worded letter on Monday and continued yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been numerous complaints regarding individuals contravening Mohawk law by residing in the Mohawk territory of Kahnawake without a right to do so. You were identified in these complaints,&#8221; the letter says.</p>
<p>The eviction letter tells non-natives they have 10 days to leave the reserve: &#8220;We trust that you understand the seriousness of this letter and that you will govern yourselves accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the non-natives can&rsquo;t move by the deadline, they must contact the band council to make further arrangements, Mr. Delaronde said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not heartless,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We know that not everyone has a brother or a parent in [nearby] Chateauguay they can stay with.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a news release on the band council&rsquo;s website, Grand Chief Michael Delisle said: &#8220;Every single Kahnawake Mohawk knows the law. It is unfortunate that some people have chosen to disregard the community&rsquo;s wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1981, the community announced a moratorium on mixed marriages, which meant that non-natives who married Mohawks after that year would no longer have the right to live on the reserve. Any non-native who had married a Mohawk before the moratorium is still permitted to live on the reserve.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, some Mohawks contested the policy before the human rights tribunal, but lost. The courts have ruled that Mohawks can make any membership policy they deem necessary for their survival as a people.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very concerned about protecting our identity because at a certain point, the Canadian government will look at us and say: &#8216;You are not even Indians,&rsquo;&#8221; Mr. Delaronde said. &#8220;We are very proud of our heritage and protective about it. We don&rsquo;t have a whole hell of a lot of it left. This is part of revitalizing the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The band council decided to act after receiving complaints from natives who feel that too many non-natives are living on the reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are responding to what the community wants,&#8221; Mr. Delaronde said.</p>
<p>Although Mohawk law says that non-natives can&rsquo;t live on the reserve, they are allowed to visit and stay overnight, he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleeping over or staying for a week is a whole different situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Delaronde said he hopes that the non-natives accept the wishes of the community and leave peacefully. If they refuse to move, their names will be &#8220;published locally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that&rsquo;s not a nice thing, but if people refuse, names will be published and then it becomes a peer pressure thing.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Why, those Filthy Racists!  How <i>dare</i> they demand that only people of their own race be permitted to live on their lands!  I&rsquo;m going to call the ACLU, the ADL, the SPLC and&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>You mean the people doing the demanding are <i>non-White</i>?  Oh.  Then they&rsquo;re just expressing their praiseworthy Ethnic Pride, of course.  Nothing to see here, folks.  Move along, move along.<br>

<p><br>
Hmmm, I may be lacking in my knowledge of Native-Canadian family history, but the name &#8220;Delaronde&#8221; sounds French, not Mohawk. </p>
<p>I suggest that if Monsieur Delaronde wants to be taken seriously as an ethnic rabble-rouser, he should change his white, &#8220;slavemaster&#8221; name to something more authentically Indian   &mdash;   like, say, &#8220;Joe Two-Skidoos&#8221;; or maybe &#8220;Dances With Reverse-Racism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Enforcement of this ruling will be by peer pressure. We&rsquo;ll have to see how eager Mohawks are to do the shunning. If this were happening among whites, there&rsquo;d be numerous whites refusing to do any shunning and instead vowing to defend the rights of the outsiders.</p>

<p>We actually ought to support the Mohawks.  Shame on the whites for shacking up with Indians.  I think the Mohawks are simply doing what Amren whites wish to do, which is to preserve their people and their particular racial/ethnic identity before it becomes too diluted.  Of course, the poster who comments on the French name of the Mohawk in the article has a point; if they are so adamant why the non-Indian, French names?</p>
<p>One thing that I know is that Chateauguay is one of the earlist settlements in French Canada.  My fifth great grandfather arrived there for the French and Indian War in 1756.  I do know that while many French remained seperate from the Indians, a good number took Indian wives.  Often, when they did that, they would be ostracized from the French community.  I imagine that this is why some Mohawks (and other Canadian Indians) have French names.</p>

<p>In other words; &#8220;However, we are happy to impregant as many white women as are honored to spend a night or a week of nights on the reservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder what the period of legal sleepover nights and the required interval will be?  In most countries a passport is good for 90 days. </p>

		<p>This is a disturbing thing.  People being forced to move because of their race.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the whole multicultural diversity movement supposed to be everyone has to mix?  The funny thing is, the multicultural crowd is extremely selective in whio they say has to mix.  </p>
<p>When Chinese people flood into Tibet, the multicultural crowd transforms into the &#8220;free Tibet&#8221; crowd, because the Dalai Lama is a cute little old man and the Tibetans seem so new age-like.  We must preserve their culture and race!</p>
<p>But if there is a black neighborhood and some white yuppies move in, then its bad and racist - changing the character of that oasis of Afrocentrism.  Of course, if there is even one square block of whites-only houses left in America - whoa, we got to integrate that fast!</p>
<p>I wonder why no one has called them out on this double standard of theirs?</p>

		<p>Actually I don&rsquo;t blame the Mohawks or any other Indian tribe in North America one bit. The American Indians were here first and have had their culture trounced on throughout the years. I&rsquo;m White but I believe fair is fair. We Whites shouldn&rsquo;t be colonized by 3rd world immigrants and don&rsquo;t like being displaced and shouldn&rsquo;t put up with it and  neither should the Indians.</p>

<p>Even Mohawks who are on the brink of extermination has their traitors!<br>
I wonder what the human rights tribunnal would have ruled if it was a white community?</p>

<p>Yeah, I know quite a few guys up there. The thing with the Mohawks is that the lineage passes through the female, not from the male side. That&rsquo;s why a guy with a French name can still be considered a Mohawk.</p>
<p>Many of them were/are good Ironworkers.</p>

		<p>I wish whites could still do this.  My mother lived in DC in the Anacostia area from 55-59 when my grandfather was stationed at Andrews.  She remembers when the first blacks moved in which was of course because some liberal whites did the buying for them.  When my grandfather died of a heart attack in 72 and was buried in Arlington my mom and grandmother went through the old neighborhood and by her junior high.  They were now all black just over a decade later.</p>

		<p>If they want to preserve their racial identity and heritage, good for them.</p>
<p>Lots of tribes, you have to have enough ancestry to be part of them.  I had an aunt by marriage who was part French Canadian and part Chippewa.  She was part of the Chippewa tribe and had lived on a reservation near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.</p>

		<p>As a general rule, French-Canadians could be considered a mixed-blooded race: the history of their colonization of Canada is more like Latin America than the US or Anglo-Canada due to the nature of Catholism and also that it was a male endeavor, involving the dregs of the male populations of Spain and France.</p>
<p>Most Indians in Quebec and Canada have French blood, most French-Canadians have Indian blood.</p>
