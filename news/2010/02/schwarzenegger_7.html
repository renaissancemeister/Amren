<h1>Schwarzenegger to Commute Sentences for Fewer Illegal Immigrant Inmates, Aides Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Yamamura, Sacramento Bee, February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s administration said Tuesday that the governor will not commute the sentences of thousands of illegal immigrant inmates even though majority Democrats sent him a budget bill this week that assumes he will do so.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One proposed [state budget] reduction was $182 million in the next fiscal year based on Schwarzenegger commuting the sentences of illegal immigrant inmates and handing them to federal officials for deportation.</p>
<p>That figure is based on an estimate Schwarzenegger gave the Legislature in last year&rsquo;s budget, assuming the governor would commute the sentences of up to 8,500 noncitizen inmates.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger officials now say that the previous figure was vastly overstated. They said Tuesday that the governor plans to commute sentences for only 850 illegal immigrants between now and June 2011. His Department of Finance believes the state will save about $19 million rather than $182 million.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 31, the state had 22,173 inmates with an immigration hold or a likely immigration hold  &mdash;  13 percent of all prisoners. The governor is considering for commutation only those with one felony for a nonviolent, nonsexual and nonserious crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we went through the fall and reviewed the cases, we realized there were a lot more serious and violent offenders in this pool than otherwise had been known,&#8221; said Department of Finance spokesman H.D. Palmer.</p>

		<p>When white people were protesting unchecked illegal aliens at Swarzenegger&rsquo;s town hall meetings a while back, he incredulously remarked that he was unaware that &#8220;racism&#8221; was so prevalent.</p>
<p>Well, now, California&rsquo;s situation is just as we knew it would be: They&rsquo;re going belly up financially, and one of the major reasons for it is unchecked illegal immigration.</p>
<p>These situations are so easy to call, it makes me feel like a seer in comparison to a left wing radical who always cries extremism at those of us making forecasts about things he doesn&rsquo;t like and vigorously tries to play down.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another forecast for them:  Califonia will go belly up in a MUCH bigger way than it is doing right now, and it probably won&rsquo;t recover even with money from the feds, because the federal government is in a state of collapse right now and it will degenerate further.</p>
<p>And another:  Multiracialism, diversity and unchecked immigration will destroy any nation eventually, and the natives have to do nothing but wait and watch.</p>
<p>And that truism will be proven in the next few months as we continue our spiral downward economically, while society also continues its plunge to levels never before seen.</p>

		<p>Have you noticed that the Marxists who who encourage mass illegal immigration are the same people who evangelize abortion in America?  </p>
<p>They are responsible for the 50 million Americans aborted thus far and are intent upon replacing America&rsquo;s murdered citizen infants with an equal number of the literate illegal criminal dregs (and their anchor babies) of the failed Hispanic nations.</p>
<p>Is this not an act of genocide perpetrated by the federal government against the American people?  </p>
<p>Think about it&hellip;</p>
