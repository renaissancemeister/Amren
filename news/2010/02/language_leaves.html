<p>In Hillsborough Circuit Court, two cases, both too serious to dismiss, are stalled for lack of a Mam translator. In one, a 4-year-old Wimauma girl was raped. The details are locked inside her mother, who speaks only Mam. And last year, Pablo-Ramirez was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, before the judge granted a motion for retrial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The man from the western highlands of Guatemala, who has only a first-grade education, had entered the United States illegally a few years earlier. Pablo-Ramirez picked up a bit of Spanish from other migrant workers. His lawyer says he knew just enough to understand the detective&rsquo;s questions. Did he have sex with the girl? Was the baby his?</p>
<p>Si, Pablo-Ramirez said. In broken Spanish, he tried to explain that he was paying child support. The lawyer says his client didn&rsquo;t understand his Miranda rights. As he was being led away in handcuffs on charges of sexual abuse and impregnation of a child younger than 12, he continued to promise he would pay for the baby.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s family returned to their home town of Todos Santos Cuchumatan, Guatemala, and sent a notarized letter to the judge, saying the relationship happened with parental consent.</p>
<p>In the letter, the father said that in his culture, boys and girls marry as young as 11.</p>
<p>While more than 15 percent of Guatemalan girls are married by age 15, scholars with the Population Council say a pregnant or married 11-year-old is very rare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is no state certification for Mam interpreters, no central bank. Texas linguistics professor Nora C. England wrote her doctoral dissertation on Mam grammar and has penned entire books about Mayan languages. Even she can&rsquo;t speak Mam well enough to translate, she says. She knows no one who does.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But Ed Fuentes, who owns an interpreter service in Washington, found a solution.</p>
<p>Seeing cases get dismissed, the Spanish interpreter considered learning Mam himself. Then one day, while waiting for a client in a jail lobby, he heard a man speaking the language.</p>
<p>The man had no interpreting experience. He earned a living by finding laborers to pick brush in the mountains. But Fuentes had never been closer to finding an interpreter. He spent 20 to 25 hours teaching the man legal terminology and court ethics.</p>
<p>Last year, when a Mam man faced a murder charge, Fuentes and his new interpreter worked in tandem at the same hearing  &mdash;  one from English to Spanish, and the other from Spanish to Mam. The case was dismissed and the man was deported.</p>
<p>Attorneys sometimes get lucky with Internet searches and track down Rosendo Leon Aguilar Carrillo, a San Francisco-based Mam interpreter who has traveled to Chicago, Kansas City, New Mexico and Seattle, charging $300 per day plus travel.</p>
<p>He says that when defendants in court can finally hear what&rsquo;s happening from a fellow Mam, some cry tears of relief.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect set up for the &#8220;Pedro and the Well&#8221; situation!!<br>
How do we know if what the intrepreter is saying is true if there is only one of them?!? The &#8220;Pedro&#8221; story goes like this. A Texas Ranger catches a Mexican bandit who has just robbed a gold payroll. The Ranger speaks no Spanish, the bandido no English. The ranger calls the stable boy Pedro over to translate. The Ranger tells Pedro to ask the robber where the gold is hidden. The robber refuses to tell. So the Ranger tells Pedro to tell the robber if he doesn`t tell right away, he get a bullet in the chest pronto. Pedro tells him and the bandit replies in Spanish, &#8220;It`s in the well!! The gold is in the well!!&#8221; Pedro turns to the Ranger and says, &#8220;He said to go ahead and shoot, Senor Ranger&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a clearer case that would back up the necessity of having English as the REQUIRED LANGUAGE in this country; anyone who can&rsquo;t speak it gets deported, period end of report.  They can learn it before they get here, and any who don&rsquo;t, can consider themselves on a fast track for deportation.  This is ridiculous - the case could have been resolved very quickly had the principals spoken our national language.</p>

		<p>We need migrant sweeps.  If they don&rsquo;t even speak Spanish to heck with their civil rights (which they shouldn&rsquo;t have in the US) and just deport them.  If the pres wants shovel ready jobs then migrant street sweepers could be hired and sent out with little training.  And hire border guards to keep them from coming back.</p>

		<p>OH, they call it Mam. And no one other than a Mayan can speak it? Is that what it is? The Mayan language, or a form thereof, is called Mam? </p>

<p>Well, this is how the do it in the old country. My stars, please do not take their culture away from them! Be respectful of &#8220;their ways&#8221;. We must not offend!!</p>

*****************<br>
Ain&rsquo;t diversity wonderful! This ignorant, illiterate illegal alien from the dregs of a South American third world country was deported. He&rsquo;s probably back in the US already, looking for a chance to rape and impregnate your 11-year-old daughter or granddaughter. (Oh, but don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;ll &#8220;pay for the baby&#8221;, because they have such wonderful &#8220;family values&#8221;, don&rsquo;t you know?)  </p>

		<p>The extremely prestigious University of California Ronald Reagan Hospital in Westwood Los Angeles contracts out with Iron Mountain, the most profitable and biggests records management company in the country to run its off site medical records storehouse located somewhere downtown.  The location is kept secret even from UCLA hospital workers so as to avoid any embarassing calls to the ICE.</p>
<p>The warehouse workers are: (1) All about 4ft 8 inches.  (2)Pure Indian features.(3) Wear tribal earrings (4) Speak neither English nor Spanish but some Indian language (5) live in the warehouse (6) Were contacted in their remote stone age village in Guatamela to come to Los Angeles. (7) Were bussed from their stone age villages to the border.  The bus stopped at the Mexican border.  The workers crossed under the tiny barbed wire fence.  Busses then brought them to the Los Angeles medical records warehouse.</p>
<p>When they come to remove records from the hospital and office buildings to the warehouse they come in groups of 4 or 5.  One will speak about 50 words of Spanish.  Spanish speaking UCLA security guards and records clerks have spoken with the Indians who speak a bit of Spanish and learned all this.</p>
<p>Iron Mountain is the biggest records management company in the country.  They store and manage records from many federal, state and local agencies.</p>
<p>And they employ stone age illegal alien Indians from primitive preliterate societies. Typical government contractors.</p>
<p>Since it was built in the 1950&rsquo;s UCLA employed legal Americans to manage its off site warehouse in Santa Monica.  But when Iron Mountain salespeople came along with their illegal aliens UCLA hospital jumped at the chance to get rid of its $13.00 per hour warehouse workers and get the stone age indians employed by Iron Mountain.   All the Americans were laid off.</p>
<p>Of course according to UCLA no White quota affirmative action policies, no White medical records clerks or warehouse workers had been hired since about 1970.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel a bit sorry for the blacks who were laid off, when UCLA went with Iron Mountain and its illegals.</p>
<p>Even the dispatcher at the Iron Mountain warehouse speaks neither English nor Spanish.  Poetic Justice.  Stone age Indians are doing to English speaking hispanics what the hispanics did to the blacks and what the blacks did to the Whites.</p>
<p>One good thing.  Iron Mountain does not let them out of the warehouse.  So the schools won&rsquo;t have to deal withtheir IQ 65 children.</p>
