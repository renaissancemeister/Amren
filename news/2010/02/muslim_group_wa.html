<p>Oren&rsquo;s speech was interrupted by shouting and protests multiple times Monday night.</p>

								<h2>Students Arrested for Heckling Oren at Irvine Speech</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) (New York), February 9, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>At least 11 students were arrested for interrupting a lecture by Israel&rsquo;s U.S. ambassador at a California university.</p>
<p>Michael Oren was interrupted repeatedly during his speech Monday night at the University of California, Irvine, which for years has been at the center of campus wars over Israel.</p>
<p>Oren was removed from the stage for a period because of the outbursts, prompting a university faculty member to take the podium and admonish the crowd, calling the incident &#8220;embarrassing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oren returned to finish his speech but did not take questions from the audience, as was scheduled, Haaretz reported.</p>
<p>In a statement received by the Orange County Register, the university&rsquo;s Muslim Student Union said, &#8220;We condemn and oppose the presence of Michael Oren, the ambassador of Israel to the United States, on our campus today.&#8221;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why Muslims will win. They still know how to fight. Christians may go to Heaven, but they are willing to endure Hell on Earth before they get there, if not actively encourage it. Christians no longer have the capacity to fight for themselves, because fighting means you have an enemy, and modern, progressive, Evangelical Christianity demands that if you think you have an enemy, then you are full of evil prejudice and you must atone by transcending and reach freedom from sin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

If we can&rsquo;t get enough people to make sure a Nick Griffin has the right to speak we&rsquo;ve only ourselves to blame. Our enemies are well organized and ruthless. They would be powerless, however, if we ever did get any significant numbers. When enough people wake up, these left wing goons and their media friends are finished.</p>

		<p> I believe it was Bill Maher (correct me if i,m wrong) who had people talking in his audience and had them removed. He explained that what they were was an audience which means to listen. People should not be talking in an audience in a movie theater or any place else unless it is opened up for discussion or questions. My personal opinion is its not about free speech its about definition. If people want to protest do it outside. People have the right to control speech on their property. </p>

		<p>This happened all over the country to David Horowitz at various campuses. White brainwashed Marxist leftists and muslim student groups did everything they could to run him off. At one point at UCLA he asked the audience of anti-hate if there was one person who didn&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;t to see him killed just for being jewish. He repeated this question several times and not one person raised his/her hand. To which David Horowitz replied &#8220;I rest my case.&#8221;. For all the peace love and happiness they claim to embrace, their the most hateful people you&rsquo;ll ever meet when they don&rsquo;t get their way. They act like spoiled children, they hate like spoiled children, they throw temper tantrums like spoiled children, and like spoiled children, their opinions mean nothing. Why people of ability and intellect don&rsquo;t boycott American universities is beyond me. </p>

<p>The hypocrisy of these muslim frauds (along with white/black/hispanic leftwingers) is maddening. They actively attempt to deny anyone that doesn&rsquo;t agree with them their free speech rights. But then squeal when something is finally done to correct this behaviour.</p>

		<p>What we need is MORE people to stand up to the Muslims - they represent the greatest security threat to the USA.  Certainly the current politicos in power are also a great threat, but Novemeber is coming soon, and I believe there will be a lot of positive changes then.  But, there&rsquo;s no positive side for the Muslims.  We need to stand up to them until we find a way to get rid of them.</p>

		<p>Hmm.. I guess there are many anti-Semitic white racists who wouldn&rsquo;t have liked Oren to speak either.</p>
<p>The difference between the Muslims and them is that, the racists still respect his right to speak under the First Amendment, as opposed to the Muslims for whom such concepts are and will always be alien.<br>

		<p>#3, I believe you mean MAINSTREAM Christianity won&rsquo;t fight, rather than Evangelicals.  The latter is made up largely of common folk who own guns, fight the nation&rsquo;s wars, and are pushing the Tea Party movement.  <br>
Nearly every day, I hear of some leftist trying to shut down right-wing discourse about abortion, same-sex marriage, etc.  Lefties constantly try to out-shout and out-whistle conservative campus speakers, and now the jihadists have joined them.  The liberals apparently don&rsquo;t care how dangerous their new ally is. </p>

		<p>Ambassadorial protocols protect an Ambassador from even mischief of this sort. Heckling and protesting an ambassadorial visit are not allowed under international conventions?</p>
<p>The extremes that a nation must go through to protect an ambassador from all sorts of insult are pretty severe.</p>
<p>There is a famous incident where centuries ago now, the French ambassador to the U.S. had his CANE merely touched by an American citizen. This was grounds for a diplomatic protest.</p>
<p>Ambassadors ordinarily enjoy all sorts of rights and privileges the rest of us do not.</p>
<p>And this sort of protection is for a reason too!</p>

		<p>They have a right to heckle and disrupt it through their speech.  The venue has a right to demand that they leave. <br>
If the ticket had no contract on it about what they were paying for with the admission, the venue might have to return the money they paid. <br>
If the contract on the ticket did state that you can be ejected without receiving your fee back, if you act disruptive then they should not have to return their fee.<br>
If people do not leave in a reasonably rapid manner, unless they have a good excuse they should be charged with trespassing.<br>
The speaker should have an overhead projector he can type arguments on in case the heckling gets too loud.</p>
