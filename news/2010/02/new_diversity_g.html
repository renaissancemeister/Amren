<h1>New Diversity Grant Offers Full Ride to Low Income, Minority Freshman at Pace Academy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>D. Aileen Dodd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pace Academy of Atlanta is using star power to raise money for a new grant that will give low income and minority teens a free private school education.</p>
<p>Taye Diggs, star of ABC&rsquo;s &#8220;Private Practice&#8221; and best-selling author Stedman Graham, the long-time companion of Oprah Winfrey, will be lending their fundraising clout to help Pace launch a new grant program.</p>
<p>The Diversity Scholars Fund was initiated by Pace&rsquo;s diversity office to increase the numbers of academically strong low income and minority teens. The grants will be offered to freshmen who could not otherwise afford Pace&rsquo;s $20,200 annual tuition for upper grades. Approximately 13 percent of Pace&rsquo;s 1,014 students are minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a fund that guarantees that each year we will set aside money for students from [low] socio-economic and diverse backgrounds,&#8221; said Philip McAdoo, Pace&rsquo;s diversity director. &#8220;With the recent economic hardships, we noticed that some of our financial aid was depleted [by current students]. We were kind of limited in what we could do for our new students.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday, at a &#8220;red carpet&#8221; fundraiser, two round-trip tickets will be auctioned off to join Diggs in Hollywood for lunch on the set of &#8220;Private Practice.&#8221; The event will be held at 5 p.m. at Two Urban Licks restaurant in Atlanta. Admission is $200.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pace has already raised $150,000 for the new fund. McAdoo said the first fruits will be awarded to two students at Ron Clark Academy, giving them a full ride to Pace for four years until graduation. Pace and Ron Clark students have bonded in recent years through a cultural exchange program. More than half of Ron Clark&rsquo;s 98 students live in households earning less than $28,000 a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no way they could afford a private education at a school like Pace without assistance,&#8221; said Clark, founder of the Atlanta academy. &#8220;We are thrilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McAdoo said the grant will eventually be extended to students in Pace&rsquo;s summer outreach and others who qualify in metro Atlanta. &#8220;We wanted to start small and grow.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What private high school is worth $20,200 a year?  That&rsquo;s more than some colleges. </p>
<p>I have found that education at the elite private high schools really isn&rsquo;t any better than that than at a good all or mostly white public high school, or an all or mostly white Catholic high school.  The only reason it &#8220;seems&#8221; better is because the sons and daughters of plutocrats go there.  The same holds true IMHO for the Ivy League in the realm of post-secondary education.</p>

		<p>While I would imagine that the administration is in a state of self-flagellation for not having a higher number of minority students, it is their school and are free to give this a try. I get the feeling that the blacks who can afford the tuition are secretly in fear of who it will bring in, but can&rsquo;t say it publicly. If they actually get poor but bright students who want to escape the ghetto schools, good for them. </p>

		<p>Ha, QD, you oughta check out The Webb School in Claremont, CA!  It costs just as much as it does to go to the Claremont Colleges and University, which are a West Coast equivalent to the Ivy League institutions in the East.  These high-powered schools are almost a guarantee for a graduate to get into an equally high-powered university, so parents who have the dough gladly fork it over.  The Webb School is comprised of primarily white and Asian kids.  Those black kids in GA better be extremely bright and accomplished, because if they aren&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re going to be left behind in the dust.  These schools don&rsquo;t do remedial classes.</p>

		<p>The blacks sent to Pace in the name of Diversity are not typical blacks. They have transcended enough of the authenticity of their communities to act white enough to not intimidate the dear darlings of the Buckhead white gene pool. But you won&rsquo;t see any white Pace parents allowing their white children to go home after school with the Diversity friends to get a look at the neighborhoods that be kepp&rsquo;n it real in the black ruled ATL.</p>
<p>Surrounding the rich white kids with proper acting blacks is a social science experiment designed to reduce white prejudice. The white kids are now supposed to think that all blacks really are white underneath that afrovoodoo skin and all crave to wear prep school uniforms and discuss Euclid and Milton.</p>
<p>The real value of this experiment is that white students will be shown at a very early age that blacks are given unearned race privileges that whites are supposed to disclaim for themselves in the name of Eracism. There&rsquo;s bound to be one or two good Buckhead white racialists in the making at Pace.</p>

		<p>So I cannot afford to send my kid to private school because I have a job and a responsible life, but the children of those who mess up their lives, generation after generation get private school for free?  Huh?</p>

		<p>Pace will pay dearly for this. Why do they think that most of those White parents put their kids in that school to begin with. They&rsquo;re funding the very people into that school that the Whites are PAYING to stay away from. I predict that as the number of thugs - oops - &#8220;low income and minority teens&#8221; increases, the number of Whites will decrease. Before long, it will be just another run down ghetto school. Skip the Psychic [ where have you been lately! ] - what do you predict. Do you agree.</p>

Yes, Tom, after a bit of half-hearted indecision, whites will flee this sinking ship,and the school will fold.<br>
Good.</p>

		<p>What you don&rsquo;t see at Pace is a cross cultural program to take Pace kids INTO the black schools in Atlanta as a means of &#8220;breaking down the barriers that separate us by changing outdated attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diversity always means whites bringing a few nice blacks into white institutions so the whites can say we aren&rsquo;t racist. White administered Diversity always means BRINGING blacks to us, never is it our TAKING white diversity to black schools and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>If Pace is serious about real Diversity, they will start an exchange student program with some of the AUTHENTIC blacks Atlanta schools.  Send the Pace kids INTO black Atlanta- that would be true Diversity, and the results would be a glorious step in the right direction of REALISM  for the rich whites in Buckhead.</p>
<p>Pace needs to be put on a Diversity Audit that reveals how none of its white students are applying for admission at black Morehouse and black Spellman.</p>
<p>Are Pace students racists for not wanting to attend majority black colleges? Somebody needs to investigate these painful suspicions.</p>
