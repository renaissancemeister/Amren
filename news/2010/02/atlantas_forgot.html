<h1>Atlanta&rsquo;s Forgotten Black History</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Henry, Creative Loafing, February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The City Too Busy to Hate has long been criticized for pursuing economic progress at the expense of history. From the demolition of the Kimball House Hotel to make way for a parking deck in 1959 through the razing of the Art Deco Terminal Station in the early &rsquo;70s, and the near-destruction of the Fox Theatre, Atlanta has a pitiful track record when it comes to preserving its past.</p>
<p>Particularly hard-hit are many places of significance to Atlanta&rsquo;s black community. With the exception of the well-maintained Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site  &mdash;  kept up, it should be noted, with federal dollars  &mdash;  few of the city&rsquo;s black historic landmarks can be said to be flourishing.</p>
<p>The original Paschal&rsquo;s Restaurant and Motor Hotel, where King and other Civil Rights titans met to discuss strategy, sits boarded up and decaying. So does the old Atlanta Life Insurance building that housed Atlanta&rsquo;s first black-owned million-dollar business.</p>
<p>Even as Black History Month strives to focus attention on the survival and achievements of African-Americans, tangible pieces of the city&rsquo;s black history remain endangered and under-recognized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are myriad reasons why the city&rsquo;s black historic sites are troubled, explains Skip Mason, archivist for Morehouse College and a specialist in Atlanta history. &#8220;The city itself has to promote a philosophy that cherishes its history and sees buildings as important to preserve,&#8221; says Mason. But there are other, more mundane factors at play, he adds, such as property ownership, community interest, and often, simple economics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes people with vision and, of course, money,&#8221; Mason says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t helped Paschal&rsquo;s or the other historic sites at the edge of Vine City that they&rsquo;re located in a part of town that&rsquo;s woefully underdeveloped, where even tax incentives have not been enough to keep retail properties afloat. &#8220;The reality is that even historic buildings have to pay their way,&#8221; says Laub.</p>
<p>Still, there have been small victories in the realm of preservation. In 2008, students from GSU&rsquo;s Heritage Preservation Program helped organize a successful effort to get the Collier Heights neighborhood listed on the National Register. Located just inside the western edge of I-285, it was Atlanta&rsquo;s first planned suburb built by and for African-Americans, who&rsquo;d &#8220;begun to flex their muscles economically and politically in the post-WWII era,&#8221; says Laub.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Which makes it all the more surprising that many of the historic structures on Auburn Avenue have been allowed to slip into disrepair, despite their rich history and proximity to the tourism nexus of the King Center, Ebenezer Baptist Church and the King Historic Site.</p>
<p>The old Atlanta Life building, located behind the company&rsquo;s current headquarters, has sat boarded up for decades. In recent months, a banner has advertised that the original 1892 neoclassical mansion that housed Herndon&rsquo;s growing business for most of the last century is available for commercial redevelopment. But with the real-estate market soured and the nonprofit community development organization offering the building all but defunct, the prospect of a rebirth appears dim.</p>

		<p>No one, not even blacks themselves, can work up any real interest in these stations-of-the-cross wannabes.  The long-ago antics of &#8220;Civil Rights Titans&#8221; are of concern only to sniveling White liberals for whom even Black &#8220;History&#8221; Month is insufficient penance.<br>

		<p>Atlanta and many other Southern cities had thriving and prosperous black business districts during the evil Jim Crow segregation. How was that possible? </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been told that Jim Crow was a Dark Ages of hate, oppression, and lynching.  How did blacks have time to build businesses when they were too busy running from the lynchers?</p>
<p>White liberals who speak of Jim Crow and the debt we still owe to blacks for segregation will never tell you of black successes during Jim Crow, and the especially won&rsquo;t ever let your consider or comment on perpetual black failures ever since Civil Rights victories.</p>
<p>Black success now is obtained by dispossessing whites through affirmative action, Diversity, multiculturalism, and then also high profit drug crime and Hip Hop.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The City Too Busy to Hate&#8221; is certainly one of the oddest city slogans ever dreamed up (probably during the drug-addled &rsquo;60s). It seems to be implying that most other cities are both hateful and slothful. And although I&rsquo;m all for historic preservation, buildings that have the misfortune of being located in a declining area do not have good prospects.</p>

Another in a long line of articles proving that few people are interested in black American history.</p>
<p>A couple years ago here in Buffalo, they renovated the Nash house. What is the Nash house? Nash was a guy who was part of the &#8216;Niagara Movement&rsquo;, said to be the precursor to the NAACP.</p>
<p>We were told it was going to be a big draw in the alleged growing market of black history tourism along with stops on the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p>The Nash house now sits idle for long periods of time. It&rsquo;s rarely open because so few people are interested in seeing it. It has even generated anger that the reason it hasn&rsquo;t been a draw is because it&rsquo;s closed too often.</p>
<p>I suspect few people care; even blacks.<br>

		<p>Some 15 years ago we went on a trip to Macon GA because the woman I was with wanted to see some of the beautiful antibellum homes in the area.  When we bought our tickets we were told that it includes a trip to the African-American history museum.  I told the ticket salesman we only wanted to see the homes.  I was told that it was included in the price and that the bus stopped there anyhow.  Well after the tour the bus pulls into some dingy rundown neighborhood that I could tell was black.  We park in the lot of what probably was a liquor store at one time with one of those old neon signs out front.  We quickly went through this &#8220;museum&#8221; and exited back on the bus.  Even steering Whites into these places aren&rsquo;t going to save them.  Nobody cares.  Blacks don&rsquo;t even care.</p>

		<p>Historical research and the preservation of black artifacts has become problematic for the African American power elite. Digging through sites on the Underground Rail Road shows that the heroic struggle of white people to aid slaves far out paced the efforts of black folks. Federal research money for the excavations of slave quarters in Southern plantations magically dried up when flints and musket balls started appearing at dig sites. The ramifications to black history were unbelievable. It turns out that until after 1825 blacks were allowed to own fire arms so they could hunt for the pot and defend the planataion from Indian attacks. If you own a spread with 200 slaves and at least 25 of them have muskets, the alaves had an alternative to bondage. It might get them killed in the long run; however death is always preferable to chains unless freedom isn`t more important to you than living a fairly decent life. Slaves have no choice, an armed man always has at least one choice fight and most likely die but take a couple of masters with you.<br>

		<p>Our vaunted liberal intelligentsia really &#8216;stuck it&rsquo; to Black Americans. With that overhyped Black History Month. Look at it from this perspective.</p>
<p>Black History needing only a month to impart; while White history takes years of school study. Really gives you a chuckle when considering the implication here.</p>
<p>As to a vis-a-vis comparison of African/Afro-Americans&rsquo; vs. Whites&rsquo; accomplishments&hellip; If you let the Great Pyramid represent what our White ancestors learned, invented or accomplished over the past 5,000 years&hellip; a common brick placed alongside the Great Pyramid can represent African accomplishments quite accurately.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how you Atlantans live black history month, every day of the year, all year long. A sampling of headlines from the ATL, the Black Mecca, Home of the Civil Rights Struggle against the White Man, birth and burial place of Rev. Michael King, Jr., residence of Civil Rights pioneer and icons Joseph Lowery and John Lewis, city of a nonstop succession of African freemen mayors whose terms are marked by failure, incompetence, and corruption and punitive property tax increases on whites. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Black History Month that threatens you, it&rsquo;s Black Reality Day that makes Atlanta so miserable.</p>

		<p>Every time the subject of black history comes up, we should bring up the extremely interesting point of black slave masters in the ante-bellum south.</p>
<p>I was going to do just that in the liberal rag around here (Asbury Park Press)this year for black history month, but for some reason they dropped the whole black history month stuff like a hot potato all of a sudden.</p>

		<p>The only way these people can even come close to generating the kind of revenue necessary to stay afloat is to bus in school children and give them a good dose of brainwashing. For the white kids it&rsquo;s the proverbial guilt-trip, for the black kids, it&rsquo;s revenge and what they see as justice in disciminating against whites through affirmative action programs etc, etc.<br>
White parents should boycott these institutions of &#8216;HATE&rsquo;!</p>

		<p>The real civil rights struggle occured between 1861-1865. It is ignored by blacks because it involved the deaths of over a half million mostly white Americans - as poorly as civil rights museums do, I bet they get far more black visitors than Civil War memorials. The sacrifices of the civil rights &#8220;struggles&#8221; of the 1960s are a rounding error by comparison to the Civil War.</p>
