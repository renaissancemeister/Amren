<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2010/02/what_does_racial_socialism_sou.html">What Does &#8216;Racial Socialism&rsquo; Sound Like to You?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Lewis, American Thinker, February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States today has slipped toward race-based socialism: That&rsquo;s the true name for an overwhelming bias for one race above others, in employment, promotion, and educational opportunities. Our media are constantly stirring the witch&rsquo;s brew of racial grievances, constantly making black people feel aggrieved and white people feel accused. Our schools drive that lesson home with young and innocent kids in a totally ruthless way. Repeat that for twelve years of schooling and TV, and you have a brainwashed kid.</p>
<p>That is what European socialists have done with class envy for the last hundred years: whip up the poor against the middle and the rich. It&rsquo;s in their standard bag of tricks. The American Left has just added racial grievances to class anger and resentment, always feeding more and more power to the racial socialists to buy peace for the very grievances they have whipped up in the first place. The NAACP today practices racial socialism. So does Obama. &#8220;Racial Socialism&#8221; drives the Left&rsquo;s current assault on American values. That&rsquo;s why Jeremiah Wright is such a significant part of Obama&rsquo;s life. {snip}</p>
<p>Only 12.3 percent of Americans are black, and they cannot command a majority vote. It&rsquo;s therefore necessary to add gender socialism, because half the population are women. {snip}</p>
<p>We are no longer a society run by talent, work, and opportunity. Like ancient Egypt and Sumer, we are a society where the ruling class exploits its productive workers by taxing their labor, talent, and ability to recognize and use new opportunities.</p>
<p>Barack H. Obama is the logical outcome of racial socialism. You can see it in his words and actions, and his very physical stance, all signaling his sense of superiority, the flip-side of feelings of inferiority he is reacting against. Obama&rsquo;s core support came from the Leftist alliance of grievance groups in spite of his total lack of relevant experience. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That is also why Obama&rsquo;s Dreams from My Father is an important policy statement, whether Bill Ayers wrote it or not. Obama is a post-colonial socialist, as was his father  &mdash;  a Kenyan who wanted revenge against white Britons who ran colonial Kenya. That is why as president, Obama bizarrely tries to diss the Brits  &mdash;  both the Queen and socialist Prime Minister Gordon Brown  &mdash;  while bowing low to autocrats like the king of Saudi Arabia. There is something very regressive about that. It is looking to the past, not the present or the future.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t we owe black Americans something for the sins of slavery? Just like we owe women for the sins of sexism, and gays for the sins of heterosexuality?</p>
<p>The answer is no. {snip}</p>
<p>But that is precisely what Racial Socialism is all about. But a society based on racial compensation turns into a tyranny, just as a society based on racial superiority does. Real democracy allows individuals to overcome their circumstances. But you can&rsquo;t overcome your race, your gender, or, in some cases, your sexual preferences. America is therefore being driven relentlessly toward a European ruling class model based on inheritance and not talent, hard work, and opportunity.</p>
<p>Race-based socialism is not progressive, but radically regressive, {snip}. The Left is always pointing the finger at mainstream America for the sin of racism. But racial divide and conquer is precisely the deliberate strategy of the Left.</p>
<p>In Britain, Labour politicians have finally confessed that they has deliberately imported hundreds of thousands of Pakistani Muslims to serve as cheap wedge-voters against British whites, while constantly accusing normal, decent people of racism. Throughout Western societies, the Left has conducted a mean and cynical assault on the mainstream of society, constantly undermining normal people while laying claim to a higher morality.</p>

		<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s AMREN article on the government paying black farmers $1.25 billion for alleged discrimination by the Dept. of Agriculture without proof of the discrimination is a classic example of race-based socialism. Thousands of black &#8220;farmers&#8221; will receive $50,000 each by merely filing a claim stating they were discriminated against when they applied for a farm loan. (It is even doubtful that there are not that many black farmers in the US)  They are not required to prove anything.  Eric Holder&#8221;s Justice Dept. made this decision along with Obama&rsquo;s AG Dept.<br>

		<p>Yes, we are already there. Look around.  The nation has regressed to a place never before America but more like Cuba or Mexico.  It has been slowly crawling in this direction since the 50&rsquo;s.  Mr O has big plans to finish the job. Over 50 years of deceit and constant legislated flagellation against white people has demoralized hardworking honest people just to please tactics of extortion, robbery, and sex crimes.  So when women are USED to make the voting numbers remind them most rape/murder cases are less often whites.  The disagreement is more than race but it has been made the issue/tactic for implementation of a nation refocused upon destructive visions. It has been a massive effort by millions of change addicts. USA never needed change ( the nation was established to exceed past social systems and did) it needed constant vigilance of Constitutional principles. Congress failed to keep US vigilently focused upon the Constitution. The distraction is now all about race!    Imagine that!!! V</p>

		<p>This obviously is not new and goes back way before anyone heard of a Barack Obama. This is one reason I scoff whenever I hear the Fox News types and Tea Party types moaning and groaning about &#8220;socialism,&#8221; as if American Blacks haven&rsquo;t enjoyed an almost completely socialistic spoils system for decades - except unlike actual Socialism, they only take and rarely give at all! Thus, American socialism is even more pernicious than most seem to understand.</p>

		<p>The analogy with socialism dividing people from the working class and the middle and rich ones does not work. </p>
<p>Whatever the shortcomings of the commie regimes in the Central and Eastern Europe were, there was at least one positive - many children of the working class people attained education and therefore middle status (although not financially) that would not have been possible earlier. And that under the school system that was not dumbed and watered two lewels down.</p>
<p>There were plus admission points for the right family background and for the right political orientation, but once in, the students were on their own. No further pandering, no different standards. </p>

		<p>Anonomys@6:16am: You have to be kidding right? Stalin starved 8-10 million Ukrainians in one year (many of them children), because the Ukrainians had the temerity to think they should be allowed to make a living off of their own labors. Read &#8220;The Black Book of Communism&#8221; before offering any praise of the most murderous economic system in world history. Most of the political left in this country think socialism is a good idea that just hasn&rsquo;t been properly implemented yet. They believe Obama is the man who will finally deliver on the Utopian dream. As has been the case throughout history; it will be a nightmare for everyone, except those among the ruling class.  </p>

		<p>Though my experience is limited to a few years, I question the observations about education under &#8220;socialism.&#8221;  I taught in universities in 2 nations run by Communist parties.  In one, there was grade inflation on the lower levels, so it was more difficult to determine the better students.  So who was admitted to uni?  Those with the proper class and political backgrounds.  Children of uni. profs might have to spend a year in a factory to be &#8220;reclassified&#8221; as working class.  A youth dedication in the FDY was a plus, a Christian communion a minus.  It was politically correctness.  Students learned what to discuss and what not, though  a large percentage of the population informed to the Stasi.  There was also affirmative action for minorities, who generally were not up to the standards of the students of German background.  Western radio and television were restricted and forbidden, etc.  Of course, many students strove to learn about the world and I suspect some may have been involved in the 1989 events that brought the experiment of the DDR to a close.  Indeed, in an article I once compared Radical Reconstruction in the American South to that in the German East.<br>
Happily China - in a more recent time - was so much freer.  Indeed, I felt freer to discuss quotas and affirmative action in classes there than I would have been allowed in most American universities.  I openly questioned the global warming propaganda.  Students were hard working and open minded.  They are nationalist and patriotic, but why not?  I do think one could discuss many more ideas at a Chinese university than at most in the US. And many of my students did come from very poor backgrounds.  But they were hard working students.  However, these fine conditions have occurred only rather recently.  Under socialism during the days of Mao, I suspect things were tyrannical in every way.  It is not socialism that makes a better university, but under socialism in China at least, universities and the economy have flourished in many ways.  But this is because China, under one-party rule, has moved away from socialism.  By contrast, the US, under 2-party rule, has moved ever closer to socialism, denial of free-speech, rejection of research into &#8220;hot&#8221; topics, quotas, and the general tyranny of the Left evident on many American campuses.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

Too late for South Africa.  Having been the international whipping boy used to convince British and Americans of the benefits of democracy, we now have a tryanny of the majority.  Of course the majority, once in power, can write the laws to benefit themselves.  Which they do.  It has resulted in a black &#8216;elite&rsquo; becoming extremely rich through corrupt practices that constitute no more than the looting of the white legacy they inherited.</p>
<p>A single example will suffice.  An ANC (African National Congress - the ruling party), wedding was held in rural Natal and was attended by some well-heeled Durbanites.  The whole area was trashed with broken bottles and glasses and two guests afterwards took their brand new cars for a spin - one in a Ferrari and the other in his Lamborghini.  As a result, both cars had their front suspensions destroyed against a lightpole, and had to be towed away.</p>
<p>&#8216;The drivers were unharmed but proceeded to racially slate any white onlookers - they beat up &#8216;Tony Simpson&rsquo; because he had a camera with him and taunted other whites with comments like, &#8220;What you want here white man, you can&rsquo;t afford a car like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;The police appeared but took no statement or accident report, they ignored the beating up of &#8216;Tony&rsquo;, and the lightpole that was bent in half will be repaired with ratepayers money.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s not the racial extermination program being waged against white America that is the problem, it&rsquo;s that the extermination program is socialist in nature.  Presumably if it were a capitalist extermination program it would be morally alright and less destructive.   It is tempting to applaud articles like this as being at least a stepping stone to conservatives finally acknowledging what only they deny, that race is the central issue in American society and politics, and that the &#8220;change&#8221; taking place is the elimination of whites first from power and then from existence.   I doubt if they&rsquo;ll ever make the next jump, though, they&rsquo;re too tied into the system.  </p>

		<p>Dear white Americans,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious enough that you had paid and re-paid several times for the instance of slavery in the history of your country long ago!<br>
This topic is obsolete and over-over-exploited by someone to keep you down in a constant state of feeling guilty.<br>
1. 90-95% of products of science &amp; technologies on this planet - everything that has greatly improved and enriched human life as compared to the Stone Age - have been invented/developed/at least pioneered by white Europeans and their descendants in America.<br>
2. The technological achievement of Black populations in Africa - through thousands of years of their &#8216;development&rsquo; there - is practically zero.<br>
3. American Blacks have greatly benefited from their living in one country with whites as compared to Blacks in Africa. Of course in the USA they live at your expense to a considerable extent!<br>
4. Slavery -  white slavery as well!! - was a rather widespread phenomenon in earlier historical periods.</p>

		<p>This article does a great job of showing how we ended up with an anti-American, anti white black named Barrack Hussein Obama as President. It also mentions something that I have noticed- his &#8220;stance&#8221;. Call it body language, mannerisms, or posture, but it is positively alarming. He saunters up to the podium with a gait that looks like a ghetto thug. The fact that he often doesn&rsquo;t wear a tie also says volumes. he is saying- &#8220;since I am in charge, I don&rsquo;t need to dress up- but you underlings do&#8221;. He does not present an image of a serious person concerned about the welfare of the country. He projects an image of a third world dictator, which he wants to be and the US to be .</p>

What is the unifying feature of the &#8220;liberals&#8221; trying to adminster &#8220;social justice&#8221;, be it in Marxian class context or when it comes to races, is not socialism but that they are all vigorously pushing us back into the Malthusian trap.</p>

		<p> the problem I have with this kind of observation is that the republicrats are both going down the same hill it&rsquo;s just that one rides the brakes and the other pushes the gas. We need a third party to arise and save us before our voting strength is diminished to the point that we no longer can.</p>

		<p>The author did not give a satisfactory, never mind convincing, rationale for the <i>&#8220;no&#8221;</i> answer to his question (quote from the full article):</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But don&rsquo;t we owe black Americans something for the sins of slavery?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The actual reason is that none of us, white Americans, had anything to do with blacks&rsquo; slavery, and ancestors of many of us suffered incomparably more in their native countries than blacks&rsquo; ancestors in America, while we got nothing back for that suffering. Just think of millions of Ashenazim (European whites with some Jewish roots) killed in concentration camps during the WWII, or hundreds of thousands of Slavs relocated to Siberia by Russian czars and by Stalin where they subsequently worked and died as slaves in incomparably harsher condtions than any black ever had to work in America.  </p>
<p>Besides, if one white commits an unethical or unlawful act then why is it so then other whites muust pay a price for it? It&rsquo;s not only illogical and unfair but is also the most blatant form of racism in itself.</p>
<p>To sum-up the above rationale, those who claim that whites today owe something to blacks for past slavery are bascically saying:</p>
<p><i>We hate those racists every bit as much as we hate those whites.</i></p>
<p>And that seems to be the bottom line here.</p>

		<p>I don`t care what happens this side of a genocidal race war between Whites &amp; Asians and Blacks &amp; browns. We are going to keep on paying for enslaving blacks and stealing half of Mexico.There is no stopping history. We  created a biological underclass when we forcedly bred Africans with white trash  whites and destroyed 25,000 years of African Subsitence cultural ethos. We did the same to the Azteca-Spaniards when we added a good dose of white trash to the tequilla. You can not compare a Mexican with a Tex-Mex. The Mexican will work like a dog, obey the law,and support his family.A Tex-Mex will behave just like a typical low IQ African American. An African from Ethiopia will come here and work harder than a Mexican, study harder than a Jew,and behave better than a Baptist. We are reaping Hell for our sins and it`s time we faced it and gave up trying to help them as a form of atonement. Every trouble they inflict on us is our fault. Turn off the tap. Bring our armies home. Arm ourselves to the teeth and get ready for Ragnarok.<br>

<p>&#8220;Anonomys@6:16am: You have to be kidding right? Stalin starved 8-10 million Ukrainians in one year (many of them children), because the Ukrainians had the temerity to think they should be allowed to make a living off of their own labors. Read &ldquo;The Black Book of Communism&rdquo; before offering any praise of the most murderous economic system in world history. Most of the political left in this country think socialism is a good idea that just hasn&rsquo;t been properly implemented yet. They believe Obama is the man who will finally deliver on the Utopian dream. As has been the case throughout history; it will be a nightmare for everyone, except those among the ruling class.&#8221; </p>
<p>I think that you make incorrect conclusions from your reading.  The reason communism was brutal in several infamous cases was because it was implemented in societies that only knew extremes, extremes such as the Romanov Dynasty in the case of the USSR, and in the face of a huge power gap and historical foreign exploitation (by capitalists) in China&rsquo;s case.  It is important to know the details of history.  Such information would inform you of how the real revolution in Russia was usurped by the Bolsheviks, which led to Stalin&rsquo;s rise.  Your conclusions hold if one is to skip past the history far right governments during the same period with similar failings and and murderous tendancies, such as Nazi Germany, Italy, and Imperial Japan.  In the post WW2, Cold War era, the Non-Aligned Nations movement, begun by Yugloslavia&rsquo;s beloved dictator Tito, maintained and promoted peace and stability in the Balkans as well as in a transitioning India and other member nations, some in South America.  In addition, there were and still are Marxist governments that have not only survived, but served their populations well while fending off exploitive capitalist enterprises that have typically left many nations in economic and ecological ruin after corporate plundering.  And you need look no further than capitalism for a centuries long record, especially since the Industrial Revolution, that have exploited and cause the early deaths of millions of people in the industrializing nations, including the U.S.A.  But as in ANY form of government, the politically powerful live well, while the common people pay and suffer.  Haven&rsquo;t we been having some discussion on this in this country lately?  In communism, you have one ruling class, in &#8220;Capitalistic Democracy&#8221; you have two ruling elites, and the corporate elites are forever interferring with the political elite, mostly through buying them off.  This has been going on since this nation was founded.  (Read - &#8220;Tragedy and Hope&#8221; - Carrol Quigley for a great synophysis on corporate and political corruption in the West).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Taking a snapshot of an issue and blinkering oneself to the larger historical epoch is easy, but an honest read of history illustrates the how and why of Marxism.  The farther the balance is pushed to one extreme, as it did in France, Russia, and China, the more radical and murderous the &#8220;correction&#8221; will be.  And like a pendulum, the swinging continues until hopefully balance is achieved, although it rarely does.  What we experience in the West today is a rather lower level of bickering and squabling as is hallmark of a system where the capitalist interests are constantly looking for corporate political advantage.  They simply replace the kings and emperors who used to exploit in the name of blood and God given right.  But capitalism interfers with the white ethnic or any ethnic identity.  It finds Western Socialism convenient, for the present, because it neuters descent and places its workers under stress as they attempt to follow the new diversity rules. </p>
<p>I knew a now deceased widow of a Kentucky coal miner who hated, absolutely hated anything remotely Republican.  That was because it was they who backed the thugs with machine guns who shot her people down when they tried to form a union in order to get some decent conditions and livable compensation for their very dangerous work.  The corporate shills just shouted that they were communists and all the paranoind know-nothings sided with the corporations in suppressing the most exploited people in American history (more than blacks).  Many of us regular posters have these people as ancestors. Typically the fundamentalist Christian gets hooked by the religious exploitation by the corporations who have somehow forced that camel through the eye of a needle.  Yet, I have met many Christian Russians who still see the strengths of some aspects of communism over the now scam ridden system of business we are forced to rely on.  </p>
<p><br>
Intellilgent whites would find a way to use the strengths of communism/socialism in forming the white survivalist ethic, since capitalism is about personal greed and exploitation by those who have the means over those who lack the means.  This historically  sets up class warfare and tends to compell the non-rich to see themselves unified by their ecomomic condition rather than recognize the more complex reasons for wishing to maintain a racial and ethnic identity. </p>
<p>It is actually in the basic teaching of Christianity, you just have to make it race conscious and then practice as perscribed.  Early Christianity spread because the rich gave their fortunes to the churches in the regions they converted and the church despersed that wealth to the poorer and needy converts.  This set up the big early waves of conversion.  It WAS communism in practice.  The early Christian communities, including the Seven Churches of Asia Minor (Turkey) duplicated the Jewish ascetic movements like the Essenes who lived in communes.  The early Christians opened membership to all and this was its early genius, because it caused the movement to grow exponentially.  But it was because of the very real materialistic comfort that the churches offered, after one accepted the psychological/spiritual requirements.  Later the RCC closed off this sharing to the public in general, becoming parasitical on its congregation, but it still functioned as a commune with a religious/political heirarchy.  The point is that early Christianity was the first case in the world of the non-ascetic religious/public practic of communism. If whites treat one another as brethren merely because of race identity, then we would have a chance against all the others who do it naturally and use it as a political weapon at all times.  I don&rsquo;t know if it is possible in the West because we are so far down the road of the extreme individual.</p>
<p>I lived and worked in a former Yugoslav nation and I can report as a witness that many former Eastern Block nations, and even former Yugoslav nations take better care of their people while they embrace the capitalist business model than our rat-race, &#8220;screw you before you screw me&#8221; mentality so well practiced here in America.  For one thing, they can still recognize one another as belonging to the same ethnic/cultural group, but the point is that they are retaining the parts of socialism that works well for them while figuring out how to play the capitalist game internationally.</p>
<p>Western Socialism is different from the old world communist model that operated in the USSR and China.  I have read online posts by Russians condemning &#8220;Western Socialism&#8221; because they see that it is out to destroy them as a people.  Just look up the words to the anthem of the Russian Federation.  It is all about the Russian people and their continunity with the past and future, quite the opposite of the apparent vision of Western Socialism.</p>
<p>White survival means the inclusion of all whites, not just the rich elites and their white dupes.  A close look would show you that they have no interest in white survival, they play the PC game better than anyone because the capitalist elites always find out how to make money from every trend.  Middle class and roor whites who support the corporate, capitalist model are the biggest fools of all IMO.  </p>
