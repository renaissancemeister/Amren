<h1>Growing Minority Enrollment Forces Schools to Adapt</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Carson, Baltimore Sun, February 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By the start of classes in August 2011, white students in Howard County are expected to be a minority, joining those in Baltimore County. The two school systems are riding a demographic wave that carries broad implications for how students are taught.</p>
<p>Baltimore County two years ago joined Baltimore City and Montgomery, Prince George&rsquo;s, Charles and Somerset counties as Maryland jurisdictions where minorities outnumber white students in public schools, although the development was little noticed at the time.</p>
<p>In those districts and others, the trend is sparking intensive efforts to shape children from all backgrounds into eager, high-achieving students. And that&rsquo;s just what is going on in Howard, school officials say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Growing diversity is a national phenomenon, and school enrollments are where the change can be the most visible, experts say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the country, we&rsquo;ve seen in the last 15 years immigrants moving into suburban areas that we haven&rsquo;t seen before,&#8221; said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow on demographics and immigration at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The Baltimore metro area &#8220;has seen a big uptick,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statewide, the population is clearly becoming more minority,&#8221; agreed Mark Goldstein, an economist and state planner who follows trends. &#8220;All of the net change [in population] is due to minority growth. That is increasingly true as we go through the decade,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Driven mostly by changes in Maryland&rsquo;s largest jurisdictions, white students became a minority group statewide during the 2004-2005 school year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans are the second-largest, at 22.1 percent, and the percentage is still growing. Asians, by contrast, were 11.9 percent of the total in 2004, but have grown to 16.3 percent this year. Hispanics make up 5.8 percent of Howard students this year, up from 3.6 percent six years ago.</p>
<p>Even though Baltimore County is two years past the milestone, many parents and students hardly notice, and many individual county schools are still mostly white.</p>
<p>Hayley Mullen, 14, who is a white student in Baltimore County, says the change isn&rsquo;t evident at her school, Ridgely Middle, where white students are 74 percent of the total, and the news surprised her parents, Laura and Tim. But the transformation has been taking place for years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all,&#8221; Hayley said. &#8220;It never occurred to me that we were the majority,&#8221; she said, explaining that her classmates at school mix easily without thinking about their race or ethnic origins.</p>
<p>That might be the most profound meaning of the change, some observers say  &mdash;  that increasingly, young people are less concerned with the traditional racial groupings and divisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the old patterns in the world will melt away,&#8221; said Joe A. Hairston, Baltimore County&rsquo;s school superintendent for the past decade and, like his Howard counterpart, the first African-American to hold his job.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not about Baltimore County or Howard County. It&rsquo;s about the world. Our kids are going to be competing against kids in other countries,&#8221; Hairston said. &#8220;They get it. I see [race] becoming irrelevant.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the reputation that Howard County has the best school system&#8221; that brings Korean families, she [Sue Song, president of the Korean American Association of Howard County] said. &#8220;Now we have a fair amount coming directly from Korea here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cousin and Hairston said the influx of immigrant families requires more teachers for students without English proficiency and other specialized programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because of the changing demographics, Howard schools have put a plethora of programs in place, ranging from those aimed at newly arrived immigrants and preschoolers to efforts to get more African-American high-schoolers involved with honors courses and college preparatory tests.</p>
<p>Howard system spokeswoman Patti Caplan said the county is placing increasing emphasis on its Black Student Achievement Program to boost standardized test scores for African-American students.</p>
<p>Schools in Howard, as well as in Baltimore County, print materials for parents in multiple languages, mostly Spanish, Korean and Chinese, as part of the campaign to get parents involved. Howard has an employee dedicated to making connections with Hispanic students&rsquo; families. Leadership forums are held to encourage involvement among parents unaccustomed to participating in their children&rsquo;s educations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are teacher mentors who help new hires understand children from different cultural backgrounds and how to reach them and their parents. Seminars, after-school workshops and daily help from mentors are all part of that effort.</p>
<p>A &#8220;Summer Bridge&#8221; program, designed for African-American students, encourages eighth-graders to try for Advanced Placement courses in high school. And a Bridge Center for students newly arrived to the U.S. provides a 15-day transition to county schools. A social worker and a teacher follow each student for six months as they work to fit in.</p>
<p>Overall, whites this year comprise 47.8 percent of Baltimore County&rsquo;s total enrollment, while blacks represent 40.6 percent, Asians 6.1 percent and Hispanics 5 percent. Six years ago, white students were a 56 percent majority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The changes in Baltimore County, for decades a destination for white families fleeing Baltimore City, come despite earlier strife, such as the 1994 race-fueled hysteria that swept the county&rsquo;s east side over a federal housing program aimed at moving poor blacks out of central Baltimore.</p>
<p>The housing program was killed by Congress, but black families have since moved on their own into the older southeastern and southwestern county neighborhoods, and school enrollments reflect that. The auditorium of Hawthorne Elementary in Middle River was the scene of a raucous, shouting protest during that 1994 turmoil by white residents who feared the federal Moving to Opportunity program would send thousands of poor city black families to eastern Baltimore County. The school is now 60 percent black, with 306 black students to 230 white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A school system is not just about educating kids. It&rsquo;s about resources, staff and faculty. As the percentage of whites decreases, it increases the degree to which other groups want that to be more representative,&#8221; he [Lester Spence, assistant professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins University] said.</p>
<p>And although attitudes might be changing, they haven&rsquo;t yet been totally transformed. &#8220;The presence of African-Americans means something very different than other nonwhite groups,&#8221; said Spence, adding that sometimes white flight results. &#8220;These other groups don&rsquo;t have the same type of weight in the white psyche.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s nothing new   &mdash;   Young people have always been enthralled with liberal ideas on race and other things.  Amazing thing happens, though:  They grow up and their frontal lobe develops and matures.  And away goes their liberalism, for the most part.</p>
<p>They might ditch the liberalism earlier, if they experience the joys of the diversity they love a little too much.</p>
<p>President Obama, while he was campaigning for President in 2007 and 2008, called for a world free of nuclear weapons during one of his whistle stop spiels.  I, too, once called for a world free of nuclear weapons.  As a matter of fact, my argument was so convincing that ALL of my fifth-grade classmates agreed with me.  Proving that some people&rsquo;s frontal lobes don&rsquo;t mature at all.</p>

		<p>Groan. This article reeks of similar writings I read 20 years ago. I had a hard time finishing it without putting my foot through my TV screen. These &#8220;experts&#8221; can put quite a spin on things so they can justify their comfortable middle class job.</p>
<p>Baltimore County does not realize the general rule, a mixed school district is merely a district in transition to nearly all minority. Hayley Mullen, at 14, will have left the district by then. </p>
<p>I predict Ridgely Middle School, 74% white this year, will be one of those &#8220;at risk&#8221; schools in 2020.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think the old patterns in the world will melt away,&rdquo; said Joe A. Hairston.</p>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;old patterns&rdquo; such as high standard of living, high academic and scientific achievement, low crime, safe neighborhoods and public transit, few drugs, no gangs, few weird tropical diseases, low taxes, etc., etc.  Those &#8220;old things&#8221; will be replaced with the benefits of Diversity.<br>

<p>So why are there any cares or concerns here?</p>
<p>Should not every &ldquo;school&rdquo; district such as this one, simply be basking in a new era of: enlightenment, enrichment, and enjoyment? Replacing whites as a majority in all things, even the USA as a whole, has been predicted by many Red &ldquo;savants&rdquo; to hold the keys to a treasure chest of  &ldquo;advancements.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So, where are they in these school systems, I ask?</p>
<p>Where is the key, to manipulating space and time; where is the question answered, as to the mystery in Loch Ness; and where is the lock on abnormal &ldquo;migration&rdquo; patterns for humanity not uncontrolled, and to be found? </p>
<p>If &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; is such a &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; why are not these three simple questions answerable, here and now, in these &ldquo;improved&rdquo; school districts?</p>
<p>Well, we all know why already:</p>

		<p>This is, really, great news for these financially-strapped school districts (I assume that their finances are as bad as everywhere else in the country, if not worse).</p>
<p>Think of all the courses they can eliminate: all High School Advanced Placement courses; all mathematics courses above and including Introductory Algebra; all courses in biology, chemistry, and physics, with the opportunity to turn the lab rooms to some use far more relevant to our new reality; French, German, and Latin courses (if, somehow, they&rsquo;re still around); any Western (and I don&rsquo;t mean cowboys) History courses; Civics courses; and any English courses that teach grammar, great prose and poetry, and how to write something comprehensible.</p>
<p>And consider all the older, mostly white, and higher-paid faculty who can be forced into early retirement because their particular experise is just no longer needed.</p>
<p>Overall, a win-win situation. n&rsquo;est-ce pas? </p>

		<p>These minority white students will be the future vanguard of the White American Citizen&rsquo;s movement.  They will tell their minority stories as a warning to all. A few will listen, and the rest will one day have stories of their own after being minoritized in their own neighborhoods. </p>

		<p>but let&rsquo;s be serious for a second:  what&rsquo;s this going to mean for &#8220;honors classes?&#8221; another standard being lowered in order to meet quotas. when i went to school, &#8220;honors&#8221; meant something different than what i&rsquo;m afraid they will turn it into.  i feel like they will take the top 10% of the student body and enroll them  &mdash;  -though i don&rsquo;t believe they would compare to a white-majority school.  i really wish we could just get honest and say it out loud.  we know how the different races stack up as far as an intelligence quotient is concerned.  we&rsquo;re just too p.c. to admit that we are smarter. period. augh&hellip;i just can&rsquo;t keep thinking about it!  makes me ill.</p>

		<p>That is true.<br>
I haven&rsquo;t seen a non-racist South African Boer in the last 15 years. They know what it means to get a minority in the own country. And most of them only go to very white countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where they can tell their stories.<br>
If a large population like the white American one, one day do the same, there will not be even one other white country supporting multi-culturalism.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a pity that so man years have to be wasted unlearning the rubbish you were taught.  That&rsquo;s probably never been truer than today, with all the loony &#8220;diversity&#8221; dogma that is shoved down students&rsquo; throats.  Then again, maybe it being such obvious crud will help some see through it more quickly.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m part Hispanic American and I was the ONLY minority in my high school. The only other &#8220;minority&#8221; in the school system at the time was a half-black girl who was in elementary. </p>
<p>There were no parents complaining of racism (or reverse racism) when their kid wasn&rsquo;t picked for a team - or lead in the class play. There weren&rsquo;t groups of kids fighting with kids of another race. Students weren&rsquo;t complaining that the American History textbooks were &#8220;too white&#8221; or that the oppressed Indians&rsquo; side of the story wasn&rsquo;t being told (heh).   It was pretty normal and uneventful b/c everyone was white (or, like me, pretty much white - having grown up around whites). </p>

		<p>Like every other negative factor multiracialsm brings, dumbing down the school system is just one more sign post that tells us this country is headed for third world status&hellip;if it survives the ongoing downward economic spiral that is giving every indication it won&rsquo;t stop until it hits severe depression levels.</p>
<p>And the above person who thinks these schools are preparing US students to compete on the world market doesn&rsquo;t understand the impact a falling national I.Q. has on a nation.</p>
<p>According to Lynn, I.Q. and Wealth of Nations, China&rsquo;s national I.Q. is 100, which is what the US used to be.  I haven&rsquo;t seen any recent studies by anyone, but I think it would be accurate to say that the US has slipped to probably around 97. With the influx of third worlders who are still sneaking in, I think it is safe to say that the average will continue to slip downwards, which means if the West survives this economic armageddon it will find it difficult to compete effectively on the world scene.  If that happens I don&rsquo;t see how the country can escape devolving into a Brazilian type society, with a sharp delineation between the haves and have nots.</p>
<p>But, taking into consideration the additional severely negative information coming out these last few weeks on the economy, it doesn&rsquo;t look as if the US will survive in its present form.</p>
<p>And to those who get uncomfortable and lapse into denial everytime such information is provided, let me say that it&rsquo;s time to buckle up and face reality.  Pretending a danger doesn&rsquo;t exist won&rsquo;t make it go away.  But, worse, it will leave us unprepared and susceptible to destruction.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new. About 30 or so years ago one of the worst high schools in my former hometown was made into a &#8220;magnet school&#8221; and the students assigned to the school were moved into neighboring high schools. One school on the far north side of town had been a decently performing White majority school since it had been built although there was some Blacks starting to move into the area. As soon as the other high school moved its nearly 100% Black students to the area the school plummited to the absolute bottom in both behavior and academics. The few remaining White students either moved or transferred. A couple of the other high schools that accepted Blacks from the Magnet school also lost academic standing, one had been a premier high school but ended up being on the losing end. Just remember- &#8220;magnet school&#8221; is a euphemism for &#8220;low performing black school trying to attract acheiving White and Asian students to raise test scores&#8221; Avoid at all costs. </p>

		<p>I have been a teacher for nearly 20 years now.  I have worked in many different schools.  I can honestly say, I have never had a white student before. NEVER.  The closest was a couple of half white kids, but never a full white student like I grew up around.  I have always taught in urban schools because that is one of the few types of environments that still hire, and minorities (majorities) are not producing enough teachers to fill their own schools.</p>

		<p>All the sanctimonious tongue-wagging by liberals notwithstanding&hellip; the often and well-demonstrated TRUTH is that diversity destroys! Take any decent school with a predominantly white student body. Bring in lots of Blacks, Mexicans&hellip; then stand back and watch the scholastic standards plummet. While crime and violence rises in direct proportion to the number of non-white students.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just a pity that so man years have to be wasted unlearning the rubbish you were taught. That&rsquo;s probably never been truer than today, with all the loony &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; dogma that is shoved down students&rsquo; throats. Then again, maybe it being such obvious crud will help some see through it more quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poorly written, but truly stated.  The blatant, nonsensical imagry in the media these days is so transparently manipulative that it must be aimed at pre-elementary school children, or non-whites, perhaps in an effort to make them comfortable among the whites they see more of the time off the tube.<br>

		<p>If we are to genuinely hold an intense debate on multiculturalism, then it must be warts and all. Hiding behind a wall of well-intentioned words is of little use when our lives are under threat every time we board a bus or train. There are many criticisms of multiculturalism, yet even now these negatives are never allowed to see the light of day. These criticisms are real words about real effects and as such transgress the idealistic and unrealistic worldview held by our liberal elites.</p>
<p>To the incoming third-worlder the white abasement ideology of multiculturalism is viewed as a weakness prevalent in the governments of the native countries. Not only are they welcomed and subsidised, they are encouraged to keep their own identities and cultures and are the recipients of state-legislated privileges not available to the native whites. It is thus an ideology that can be used to advance their ethnic group self-interest over and above that of the native group. I can only assume that their private discussions must revolve around disbelief and astonishment that any race or culture could prostrate themselves before an aggressor in such a grotesque and effeminate manner.</p>
<p>The white proponents of multiculturalism are hypocrites. They are in the main, middle class suburban or rural dwellers of majority white enclaves. One peculiarity of white liberals is that whilst they embrace the ethnic colonisation of the West they are repulsed by the history of white colonisation in the East, thereby showing that their political views have less to do with colonisation per se and more to do with a hatred of Western civilisation. Trying to find a working class man in a gritty and diverse part of town who supports this peculiar ideology is akin to discovering a conservative at the BBC or a democrat in church. Put simply, Western liberals, feminists and homosexuals, who for reasons known only to themselves support multiculturalism, do not choose to live in Riyadh yet hold up Islamic culture as equally valid. </p>

		<p>This just shows how antiquated the American school system is.  They are stuck in a tired, outdated, inefficient model of children being herded into classrooms where huge amounts of their time is wasted and they have zero choice as to who teaches them or their curriculum.  Time for change?  I wish.</p>

		<p>27 Alice: If kids had a choice of teachers and curriculum, most would choose a celebrity to teach them about how to become a celebrity.  Few kids, for that matter few adults, would prefer English Literature or trigonometry to watching an Adam Sandler or Sandra Bullock movie.  </p>
