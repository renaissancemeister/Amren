<h1>Toyota Ignores Black Community Customers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hardy L. Brown, Black Voice News, February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Toyota automobile company has implemented a worldwide recall of many of its cars with the company reaching out to its customers saying stay with us. Bring your cars in for repair and be careful while driving until you can get it repaired. The executives have been on television, radio and even put paid advertising in major daily newspapers nationwide to inform their customers of the sticking gas pedal and to stay with them. General Motors and Ford have begun advertising the message, bring your Toyota product in for trade to our products. They are doing all of this while ignoring the owners of Black newspapers and radio stations which is an issue for me.</p>
<p>They are aware that we&rsquo;re here because they have invited us to drive their cars so we could write about how they drive and the quality of their products. They even send us company press releases to publish for our readers.</p>
<p>{snip} Yet, when it comes to spending money with any of us, they stop. The same is true with other companies but this article is focused on Toyota from my perspective.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, I would take a quick count of the makes of Toyota autos in the parking lot of St. Paul AME Church on any given Sunday morning. I was doing it because I had a Black owned Lincoln Mercury/Volkswagen dealer advertising in my paper.</p>
<p>{snip} I asked you my readers when was the last time you went to a function or event held in the Black community that Toyota was a sponsor.</p>
<p>How many Toyota dealerships are owned by African Americans? How many Blacks do you know that supplies products or services to Toyota?</p>
<p>Now Toyota on the other hand was not spending any money with us nor were they supporting any groups or programs in the African American community locally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let us take a look at where Toyota sells the most cars.</p>
<p>Toyota&rsquo;s occupy nine of the top ten spots in California for selling cars with each dealer averaging at least 3,500 sales per year. These are the areas with the percentage of sales in the area: San Gabriel Valley 27.6%; San Fernando Valley; 26.6%; Oakland 26.3%; Inland Empire 25.3%; North San Diego 24.8%; Orange County 24.5%; Los Angeles South Bay 24.1% and Sacramento at 23.6% according to a report by Mr. Jim Lentz, Executive Vice President of Toyota to Auto Week. Blacks spent $3.8 billion on cars and related services according to Target Market News in 2006 in California. Toyota spent $2 billion in advertising in the same year and had a special department for the Hispanic population according to a report they submitted to advertising age.</p>
<p>So the question to Toyota is why do you ignore the African American community when it come to reallocating money back into the community that buys your products?<br/>

		<p>Blacks have no money!  Why would a company market to people who have no money.  Why do most whites in business and positions of walk on eggshells when it comes to race and blacks and then demonize the people who can/do buy your stuff (middle class white Americans)?  I don&rsquo;t get it.  That&rsquo;s a stupid business model</p>

<p>Dear Mr.(or Mrs.,or Ms.) Hardy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t guess this has-or will-ever occur to you,so I&rsquo;ll bring it up in the hopes that you,or a compatriot who is hopefully brighter than you,will see it and do some thinking.</p>
<p>Toyota&rsquo;s money belongs to <i>Toyota</i>. Those funds are to be allocated any way the Toyota Corporation sees fit. Not the way you see fit. That money does not belong to you. Got that? It is not your money. You didn&rsquo;t earn it-the Toyota Corporation earned it. And I might add that it was earned by providing superior products at affordable prices. Would that your &#8220;community&#8221; did the same&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you free to ask a question regarding the allocation of funds by a corporation? Sure. Ask away. Just remember that Toyota isn&rsquo;t under any sort of obligation to provide an answer. Not now,although since the current administration in D.C. is a bunch of complete whackos,there&rsquo;s no telling what will happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re at it,could you encourage your &#8220;community&#8221; to boycott Toyota products? I&rsquo;m sure that Toyota would be more than happy to wave goodbye to customers who-if my experience is any guide-are very likely to be surly,overly demanding,and insist on not paying their bills.  </p>

		<p>Does anyone now wonder why so many businesses refuse to come to the U.S.?  Or, why so many have left? This article and the petty complaining involved in it is the answer! Black people in the U.S. have got to be the most self-absorbed, ingratiating, self-worshipping people I have ever known. It&rsquo;s all about them, them, them!  Every complaint they have is related to some material issue, like cars, shopping, housing or restaurants. Blacks have single-handedly corrupted labor unions in the U.S. with their laziness and ruined the once-thriving business climate. It is because of black whining that the laws dealing with finance changed and now we are in a financial disaster of epic proportions because of it. </p>

		<p>I read the complete article, and the not-so-subtle message is explicit, &#8220;If you want to be covered as &#8216;news&rsquo; by the Black media, you better pony up some ad money. This &#8220;pay to play&#8221; mentality is one reason that Black media are not taken seriously. </p>
<p>As far as the Census taking out ads in foreign language publications but not Black publications, well Duh! Black people read major newspapers and watch network TV just like everybody else. But those with limited English skills are not going to read or watch in a language they don&rsquo;t understand well. </p>

		<p>Does Brown really believe that Toyota executives spend time at meetings figuring out how they can best exploit the black community without &#8220;reallocating money back into the[black] community.&#8221;?  Are his readers supposed to believe that he actually spent 10 years &#8220;take[ing] a quick count of the makes of Toyota autos in the parking lot of St. Paul AME Church on any given Sunday morning.&#8221;? Does the black community ever approach Toyota when it wants endorsement for its activities? Do their newspapers&rsquo; ad sales departments go to Toyota dealers in search of business? Instead of sitting around whining, why don&rsquo;t they go out and get what they want from Toyota, unless, of course, they are hoping that they can get the NAACP to get the go&rsquo;m&rsquo;nt to pass some kind of &#8220;fair reallocation&#8221; mandate. What utter rubbish! </p>
<p>Furthermore, he has taken out of context that fact Toyota has a &#8220;special department for the Hispanic population.&#8221; That department simply works on the bilingual aspect of Toyota&rsquo;s marketing. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious reason why Toyota nor other Japanese automakers bribe black big mouth loudmouths   &mdash;   Because the Japanese tend to be far more frank and politically incorrect when it comes to our citizens of a very high melanin level.   Notice that most Japanese auto plants in the U.S. are far away from central cities, and therefore far away from blacks.</p>

<p>I remember when Nissan put up a plant in Smyrna, Tenn. the blacks and the UAW raised bloody hell with Nissan, but Nissan never caved and to my knowledge, have not yet.</p>

<p>6 Q.D: I remember when Toyota was first building plants in Tennessee, I think it was.  Some writer at National Review (?) wrote how the Japanese were avoiding Blacks in order to preserve the quality of their products.  They would not entrust their reputation to inferior workers with bad attitudes.  </p>

		<p>The headlines should more appropriately read: Black community customers ignore Toyota. I suspect the uproar about Toyota is more vehement because it is such a rarity. To me Toyota has always embodied values of quality and economy without all the bling, value entirely alien to the black community.</p>

		<p>I wonder if this has something to do with the recalls?  It seems as though the US government is making a big deal out of Toyota&rsquo;s recalls and I wonder if it&rsquo;s partly because they own interest in Chrysler and General Motors?  A great deal of the labor force of the big 3 is diversified now and I wonder if they&rsquo;re trying to get blacks to boycott Toyota.  I&rsquo;ve never owned a Japanese car in my life because I always thought they were too small and I didn&rsquo;t like their designs.  Of course patriotism always played a role in it as well.  Now that the US government is taking over private industries and implementing socialism I&rsquo;m considering buying something to support my own race like an Audi, European of course.  With America&rsquo;s labor force changing I&rsquo;m highly skeptical that this country will ever be competitive in the automotive industry ever again or in any other industry. </p>

It appears that decades of entitlement programs from the public sectors have conditioned blacks to expect entitlements from the private sector also   &mdash;   even the private sectors of countries <i>on the other side of the world!</i> That&rsquo;s the only explanation I can offer for the astonishing levels of foolishness and self-absorption found in this article. </p>

<p>Welcome to the world you want, &ldquo;when it come&rdquo; to destroying the West and &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; at all costs, Comrade Brown.</p>
<p>You and your people are: arrogantly ignorant, despised the whole world over, and are about as productive as liver cancer. So what and big deal, that your kind spends money on Toyotas, is that some new insight? Your kind also would prefer a Cadillac or Mercedes to those Toyotas, if or when you can get them &ldquo;when it come&rdquo; right down to it.</p>
<p>Thus, here is your &ldquo;unified&rdquo; global majority &ldquo;of color,&rdquo; operating as expected. Asians and Hispanics only use your hatred and stupidity against you and for their own gain, never for the reverse. </p>
<p>In short, Toyota wisely is protecting the valuable host here (if also, ironically and instructively) over the worthless feeders and breeders.</p>
<p>Go figure?</p>

		<p>If my memory serves, in the not-so-distant past Toyota ran an ad targeting blacks.  Besides featuring the company&rsquo;s best concept of a bling-mobile, the ad zoomed in for a closeup of a black-lipped smile with a sparkling gold tooth.</p>
<p>For Toyota&rsquo;s having displayed such offensive insensitivity, the Most Reverend Je$$e Jack$on induced the company to initiate an $800 million diversity marketing research campaign.</p>
<p>Toyota no doubt feels it has invested enough in the African-American community.  </p>

		<p>This is off the issue but I understand that the defective brake parts for the recalled Toyotas came from a US supplier here in the states and that car makers in Japan were unaffected by it.  The parts were poorly engineered and not tested extensively.  This is very embarrassing for US manufacturing and I wish there was some way of knowing which plant it came from and what percentage of their workforce is black and brown.  I would really like to know if affirmative action cost Toyota all those billions of dollars in repairs and sells.  If it&rsquo;s true how are we ever going to compete with the rest of world when we are straddled with so many incompetents?  I wouldn&rsquo;t say we never will because I think the US government has a plan to export &#8220;diversity&#8221; to the rest of the world so that no matter what part of the world you buy a product it will be of the same inferior quality.</p>

		<p>Toyota doesn&rsquo;t spend much on getting black customers for the same reason that major chain markets like Ralph&rsquo;s, Von&rsquo;s, etc. don&rsquo;t have stores in the black ghetto communities.  They got tired of having buildings burned down, cashiers harrassed, robbed, and pistol-whipped, windows broken, being stolen blind   &mdash;   Toyota doesn&rsquo;t want any of that garbage either so they aren&rsquo;t about to court the &#8220;black&#8221; market, so to speak.  I don&rsquo;t blame them at all!!  Until blacks change their behavior, no decent business are going to want them as customers.</p>

		<p>I have a lot of respect for Toyota even though I&rsquo;ve never owned one of their products.  A bio of Jesse Jackson, published in 2002 entitled &#8220;Shakedown! : exposing the real Jesse Jackson&#8221; by Kenneth R. Timmerman, relates how Jackson took his shakedown scam to Toyota&rsquo;s corporate executives in an attempt to extort money from them in the same way he had many other corporations.  Toyota basically told him to take his scam and put it where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t the black papers and radio stations have  salespeople constantly badgering every company in town to advertize in their publication or station?</p>
<p>Salespeople from the mainstream papers and radio stations spend their days bringing in advertising.  Why can&rsquo;t the black papers and radio stations do this.  Or their salespeople typical affirmative action employees, do nothing and get paid.<br/>

		<p>I apologize to fellow AmRen readers for a misrepresentation I made in an earlier post.</p>
<p>Toyota&rsquo;s &#8220;deal&#8221; with The Most Reverend Jack$on (made in 2001) was to commit some $8 BILLION!!! to increase minority participation in the company over a 10 year period.</p>
<p>Other &#8220;contributions&#8221; to organizations affiliated with The Most Reverend were noted at about that time, but Toyota denied they were made as payoffs to avert a threatened boycott of the company. </p>
<p>Toyota currently boasts of employing a diversity advisory board to help keep the company in step with minority concerns and on good terms with Black Enterprise, etc. </p>
<p>Interesting, huh?</p>

Hardy L. Brown, like many of his kind, seems unclear on the basic concepts of rights and responsibilities under capitalism. And since the current occupant of the White House bears unprecedented hostility toward capitalism, there&rsquo;s no point expecting Pres. Obama to explain it to the likes of Mr. Brown either. So I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to do it myself. Here goes: </p>
<p>Mr. Brown, your article operates on the assumption that because black people occasionally buy Toyotas, the Toyota company therefore OWES black people some sort of debt   &mdash;   a debt which should be repaid by extensive advertising in black media; and more catering-to and wooing-of blacks in general. </p>
<p>This assumption is incorrect.</p>
<p>If a black American (or anybody else) buys a car from Toyota, the ONE AND ONLY THING that Toyota owes that person is a quality vehicle with specs and performance as advertised. </p>
<p>If a black American (or anybody else) does not buy a car from Toyota, then what Toyota owes that person is NOTHING AT ALL. </p>

		<p>This article is a good example of just how deeply ingrained, irrational and askew the black entitlement mentality really is. Toyota owes blacks absolutely nothing. If blacks buy these cars then they are entitled to a good car in sound mechanical condition. That&rsquo;s all. Beyond that Toyota owes blacks nothing. If I buy something at Wal-mart does that mean the Walton family or Wal-mart &#8220;owes&#8221; me something? That is ridiculous. In any case if blacks feel they are being &#8220;shafted&#8221; they are always free to take their business elsewhere.</p>

<p>Writer Brown must realize that Corporate Japan is not the politically correct, hand-wringing entity that Corporate America is. The Japanese could care less about King&rsquo;s march on Washington or Bantu History Month.</p>

		<p>Here in Indiana, I can think of three Japanese auto plants right off the top of my head. Subaru-Isuzu in Lafayette, Toyota in Princeton, and Honda in Greensburg. All of these communities have very low percentages of blacks. These plants are thriving while Government Motors is looking to close a metal stamping plant that is within walking distance from downtown Indianapolis. Back in the 1960&rsquo;s, 9000 people worked there. It is even worse in Anderson, Indiana. 30,000 people worked for GM in the early 1970&rsquo;s; all of those jobs are gone now. Anderson isn&rsquo;t like Gary, so far. </p>
<p>I have owned American, Japanese, and German automobiles and NEVER had a lemon with foreign cars. If Toyota tells these people to pound sand, I may buy a Toyota the next time I am in the market for a car.  </p>
<p>What would happen if Toyota announced that the problem is with an American parts supplier whose work force is predominantly black? XYZ corporation over hires minorities to keep the government off of its back. Auto quality can go out the window so long as we meet quotas. </p>
<p>There probably aren&rsquo;t a lot of gun advertisements in Ebony, Jet, or black newspapers. Considering the number of minorities who find themselves on both sides of a weapon, incarcerated on murder/attempted murder/armed robbery/etc. charges, this should be an outrage. On government paydays and after championship sporting events, the amount of gunfire should warrant some serious sponsorship by Baretta, S&W;, Colt, and other firearm manufacturers. </p>

		<p>Cry me a river.  How many auto companies will ever dare to advertise in American Renaissance?  Or any other explicitly pro-white publication?  Hardy L. Brown writes for an explicitly pro-black publication, which is acceptable in our society even if it&rsquo;s not as lucrative as he&rsquo;d like.  But <i>any</i> pro-white publication will be shunned by nearly all advertisers and will be attacked relentlessly by the media and every group to the left of Youth for Western Civilization.<br/>
