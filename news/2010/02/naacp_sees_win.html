<h1>NAACP Sees Win in Court Ruling on Race Profiling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea F. Siegel, Baltimore Sun, February 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The state&rsquo;s second-highest court handed the NAACP a victory Tuesday in the long-running &#8220;driving while black&#8221; issue, ordering the Maryland State Police to turn over records showing how the department dealt with complaints of racial profiling by its troopers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>None of the 100 complaints of racial profiling over five years had been upheld in state police internal investigations, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which also is involved in the case.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Maryland attorney general&rsquo;s office will decide whether to appeal to the state&rsquo;s top court after reviewing the ruling.</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General David R. Moore said Tuesday that the ruling interprets what constitutes personnel records under the Public Information Act and can be cited as precedent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision overturned part of a ruling by a Baltimore County judge, who said the records sought were personnel documents. But it left intact the end result: NAACP lawyers can have the documents but with the names of troopers redacted.</p>
<p>The background of the case stretches back nearly two decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ACLU contends that the racial breakdown of drivers stopped from 2003 to 2008 was about the same as it was in 2002: Minorities were targeted in 70 percent of the stops, and 45 percent of the drivers were black. Troopers found drugs on minorities no more frequently than on white drivers, the ACLU says.</p>

		<p>Follow the logic:<br>
Blacks are over represented in the federal prison system for convictions of federal felonies.<br>
Blacks are over represented in the state prison systems for convictions of state felonies.<br>
Blacks are over represented in county jail systems for convictions of misdemeanors.</p>
<p>Why would any on think that blacks are different at the traffic offense level?</p>

		<p>Overlooked in all the silliness about racial profiling is the simple fact that profiling is the core essence of any effective law enforcement.</p>
<p>And like it or not, blacks comprise the majority of the criminal class in America.  It&rsquo;s simply common sense to keep them under a higher level of surveillance that the rest of the population at large.</p>

		<p>This case will ultimately go nowhere.  The U.S. Supreme Court has already said profiling is ok and even that there&rsquo;s no racial bias in executing more black men.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Retired Cop&#8221; said it best; why would anyone think blacks take traffic laws any more seriously than they do laws against murder, rape, robbery, etc.</p>

		<p>To Retired Cop - congratulations on making it to the &#8220;afterlife.&#8221; I have 7 years to go.</p>
<p>Anyway, since journalists are supposed to be objective observers, it&rsquo;s important to note here the absence of an alternative explanation - MSP did not sustain any accusations of racial profiling against its troopers because there WASN&rsquo;T ANY!</p>
<p>Another logic-defying issue here that I guess only white people would overlook is this - the NAACP, a racially exclusive group whose PUBLIC charter is to promote the advancement of blacks, is claiming a racially exclusive act has been perpetrated against them!</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>This is just as idiotic as the time when the Congressional Black Caucus (another afro-centric, racially exclusive group that only white people are dumb enough to &#8220;accept&#8221;) went off on a rant that congressional staffs weren&rsquo;t diverse enough.</p>
<p>White people are doomed. Some of us are just kamikaze idiots. We see a high-speed rocket to extinction - diversity - and jump right on. In the same breath that we &#8220;deplore&#8221; racism, we welcome some racially exclusive bunch of cry-babies like the NAACP or La Raza.</p>
