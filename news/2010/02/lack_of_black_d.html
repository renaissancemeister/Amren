<h1>Lack of Black Doctors Traced Primarily to Pre-College Factors, Study Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>UVA Today, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-Americans have long been underrepresented among health care professionals. As of 2005, blacks made up slightly more than 8 percent of first-year medical students in the United States  &mdash;  roughly half of their share of the U.S. population (15.4 percent in 2007), and just 1 percent more than their share of ﬁrst-year medical students in 1975.</p>
<p>Much of that overall gap can be traced to social and economic problems that generate substantial group differences that become entrenched before the college years, according to a new study led by an associate professor of economics at California State University, Sacramento, and co-authored by six University of Virginia professors representing four disciplines: economics, psychology, education and nursing.</p>
<p>The study, &#8220;The Educational Pipeline for Health Care Professionals: Understanding the Source of Racial Differences,&#8221; is based on research done while lead author Jessica Howell was a visiting professor of economics at U.Va. during the 2005-06 academic year. It appears in the Winter 2010 issue of the Journal of Human Resources.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cohort was tracked into their 30s, long enough to collect data on college attendance and graduation, post-collegiate schooling and career choices, Howell said. The representation of blacks in the 1972 cohort declined from 11 percent at the point of high school graduation, to 9 percent at college entry, to 7.2 percent at college graduation, and to 4.1 percent at the stage of entry to the health professions (which, for this study, included physicians, therapists, dentists, registered nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, optometrists, dietitians and veterinarians, among others.)</p>
<p>Howell and her team modeled the changes in the cohort at each stage along the educational pipeline. The modeling found that when personal background factors (including rural versus non-rural location and parents&rsquo; educational attainment) were taken into account, black students were more likely than others both to enter college and to graduate from college. Although this finding may seem surprising to some, this general finding has been well documented by social scientists, Howell said.</p>
<p>The majority of the differences in the representation of blacks and whites at the post-baccalaureate stage of entry to a health profession can be traced to gaps generated much earlier in the educational pipeline, Howell said, and stem from factors like parents&rsquo; education level and students&rsquo; attending schools with lower per-pupil spending, higher poverty rates, and lower average scores on standardized tests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remedies that narrow the pre-college educational gaps between black students and other students, Howell said, would improve not just the proportion of blacks in health care, but would also affect any number of professions, such as black representation in law or in business management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Controlling for background characteristics and the type of college attended, measured by both institutional selectivity and status as a historically black college or university, black college graduates were &#8220;substantially&#8221; less likely than other college graduates to pursue post-baccalaureate health care programs, the study found.</p>
<p>This post-college leakage can probably be explained by financial incentives, the study suggested. {snip}</p>
<p>Proposals to provide subsidies to encourage blacks to enter the health care professions could reduce the post-college leakage, but would not address the main cause of black underrepresentation, said study co-author Steven Stern, a U.Va. professor of economics who served as Howell&rsquo;s doctoral adviser at U.Va. (Howell completed her Ph.D. in 2004.)</p>

<p>This is the weeding out process.  Not everyone who wants to be a doctor at 16 is capable of being a doctor.  As the curriculum becomes more rigorous the less able fall to the wayside.  Not racist but perfectly normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;black students were more likely than others both to enter college and to graduate from college&#8221;</p>
<p>This is to be expected, it is called affirmative action.  The white has to gain admission and graduate on his own merits.</p>

<p><br>
The behavioral choices blacks freely make are the root cause of their lack of progress like single parents with no income having children they can&rsquo;t afford. As to the schools with lower per pupil spending excuse, that is not true here in Hartford CT where they actually spend more per pupil in Hartford then they do in the surrounding suburbs and ironically they actually bus many of these urban blacks to the lower per pupil spending schools in the suburbs due to mandatory race mixing thanks to the infamous lawsuit of Scheff vs O&rsquo;Neal. The result being the same high failure rate. The liberal idea that if you sit a dumb kid next to a smart kid in the classroom, the dumb kid will smarten up apparently doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>

		<p>No wonder that   &mdash;   controlling for &#8220;personal background factors&hellip; black students were more likely than others both to enter college and to graduate from college&#8221;  &mdash;   black students have an enormous number of activists and an avalanche of government funds pushing them through the system. Plus, they have the HBCUs, which pass out degrees like candy at Halloween. But in the end, when blacks get into a serious environment, such as a (non-historically black) medical school, they fizzle out. I can tell you that at the medical school I know best, great efforts are made to recruit black students, very few of whom survive to their second year. </p>

		<p>Why, what a WONDERFUL idea!  Nobody&rsquo;s ever thought about doing things for black kids, prior to Med School before!  I&rsquo;m sure these things will have the black kids positively SHOOTING through &#8216;The Educational Pipeline&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Just think!!!  You could start out with government-bankrolled prenatal care, then follow up with programs for the little ones&hellip;maybe call them something like HEADSTART or something&hellip;</p>
<p>And all along the way, you could be making sure they got coats in winter, and good food (maybe issue little coupons, and call them FOODSTAMPS!).  And you could even subsidize the little black kids&rsquo; mommas&rsquo; rent&hellip;even move them into white neighborhoods, to get them away from &#8216;crime&rsquo;!</p>
<p>And when they got into gradeschool, you could bus them into rich white schools, or bus rich white children to their schools, just to be sure they were getting an education like the white kids were getting.  Yeah!  </p>
<p>And to make sure that the parents of these future doctors were being brought up to par, too, you could create a legal climate in America that ensured the black parents had access to jobs far exceeding their levels of competence.  We could call it &#8216;Affirmative Action&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then, you could ensure they get into college, by bending the admissions rules for them (but quietly&hellip;you wouldn&rsquo;t want them to get a complex, or anything), and letting them in, despite low scores on standardized tests.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ms Howell, for your brilliant idea!  Can&rsquo;t imagine why no one has thought of these things before!</p>

		<p>Its really not very complicated:</p>
<p>IQ 120 or so is the minimum required to excel in med school.</p>
<p>Only ca 1% of US blacks have IQs this high (several hundred for every year cohort).</p>
<p>If med school admission / graduation were on merit, only a tiny number of doctors would be black, but they would be competent and could hold their heads up.</p>
<p>People would need not fear being treated by them. </p>
<p>With AA, the number is still small, but many practicing black doctors would never have made it into med school if white (I geuss they work in the military or in poverty clinics).</p>
<p>As usual the facts are simple, but unacceptable, hence the miasma of gibberish and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Our society&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge racial differences in intelligence and temperament = incompetent black doctors.</p>
<p>Punch line:</p>
<p>None of my affluent liberal/progressve/radical/socialist/communist/etc. friends have EVER had a black doctor. </p>
<p>How many affluent blacks have black doctors??</p>
<p>million dollar question:<br>
IS OBAMA&rsquo;s FAMILY PHYSICIAN BLACK?</p>

<p>The entire system of raced-based spoils is based on conscious and deliberate lies, and most blacks know it.</p>

<p>Where are the black airline pilots? Yea rite. Forget the African nations where the black pilots crash all the time with the worst records on earth. </p>
<p>Where are the black brain or heart surgeons? Surely ye jest.</p>
<p>They need to face reality and stop making excuses. The black race intelligence in limited in spite of the famous Tuckaseegee pilots in WW2 fake tall tales and myths. </p>
<p>To date there are no black heart or brain surgeons or commercial airline pilots since there are some things affirmative action are N/A for.</p>

		<p>This makes me think back with some degree of bitterness to twenty or some years ago when I was in high school.  I was taking Calculus, Physics, Biology, Advanced History and Advanced English.  There were no minorities in any of these classes.  Nevertheless, at the senior awards ceremony it was anounced that two candidates, a Puerto Rican and a Black (we didn&rsquo;t have to call them African Americans back then) were accepted to the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy respectively.  I had never heard of these guys.  They weren&rsquo;t in any of my classes.  They weren&rsquo;t with me on the Cross Country, Track, or Wrestling Teams.  But they were accepted to these prestigious academys (they did have to attend the Naval Academy Prep School for one year before actually attending).  I on the other hand was denied entrace.  I did get into the Merchant Marine Academy which is a great school, but probably the easiest academy to get in to.  So despite superior qualifications, I lost out.  At the time I was an ignorant liberal.  I thought it was good that we were allowing those less qualified minorities to go to schools they weren&rsquo;t qualified to attend.  You see I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but I was practicing the  soft racism known as low expectations.  I believed we had to allow the lesser able, opportunities previously reserved for those of greater merit.</p>
<p>Many years later I consider myself a hostile conservative.  I am filled with bitterness when I think back to the opportunities my government denied to me because of my race.  I think we can all agree that the U.S. will never enter into a post-racial period as long as the policies of racial-socialism continue to make greater and greater inroads in our society.</p>

<p>Except for when that mistake is to not wash their hands before handling your burger (and after doing twosies) and the end result is a viral infection that kills you or one of your loved ones.</p>
<p>When will it again be socially permissible to publicly acknowledge the fact that racial differences are real, and the reason that these people don&rsquo;t perform as well as whites is because they aren&rsquo;t as smart as whites? In how many countries, some mixed-race, some nearly 100% black, do blacks have to do worse than whites before we start to realize that it&rsquo;s not &#8220;discrimination&#8221; or &#8220;the legacy of slavery and oppression&#8221; that causes this?<br>

		<p>In other words, more excuses, and money, are needed to compensate for the lack of ability of the black population.  I can hardly wait for the study that explains why black pro basketball and football players are so disproportionate to their percentage of the population, while white players are so much less represented in these professional sports.</p>

		<p>This is just such a bunch of hogwash! </p>
<p>Those of Euro descent in America started in 1865 with the effort to teach/educate blacks to be a self-sufficient race of people - independent of the white population. In 1910, the NAACP was launched (by white altruistic &ldquo;Progressives&rdquo;).   This organization, witnessing the abundant failures of the African race in America&rsquo;s - white male created - urban centers,  realized the ONLY solution was to &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; integrate the black race into the white race. Thus was invented the concept of integration.  </p>
<p>It took 54 years to have forced integration codified into law (1964Civil Rights Act).  However, in order to launch forced integration (Compulsory Inclusionism), what first needed to be explained away was why there existed the vast differences in the living arrangements of whites and blacks (i.e. why white communities had so much more than black communities).  This was going to be accomplished by asserting that &ldquo;education is the key.&rdquo; It is also known as the &ldquo;Bridge Theory&rdquo;.  That is, white people had access to better education facilities; and that academics, at these &ldquo;better institutions,&rdquo;  educated white people (specifically males) how to operate in the occupational tiles.  </p>
<p>Hence, because of white peoples&rsquo; better education, they were able to create a higher standard of living than blacks. This, my friends, is what we all bought into.</p>
<p>https://leretseh.blogspot.com/2009/12/bridge-theory-is-it-hoax.html</p>
<p>After 45 years, the evidence is in: forced integration has been a total failure. And the Bridge Theory is a hoax.</p>

		<p>Now, can somebody explain to me why it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to get a British doctor in many hospitals and medical practices in the UK? Our medical schools are filled with Indians and Pakistanis whose parents moved to the UK 20 years or so ago. Meanwhile we&rsquo;re importing doctors and all other medical staff from those same countries and even from Africa. Many of these third world doctors have turned out to have very dubious medical credentials or qualifications, those who have been exposed due to malpractice. Presumably others are still working and continuing to put the well-being and lives of their unfortunate patients at risk. Why has this been allowed to happen. I suspect the circumstances which lead to this appalling situation are creating the same scenario in the United States, Australia, Canada etc. Coincidence or planning?</p>

		<p>White elite liberals should never be allowed a White Doctor.  They must all proclaim their allegience to black doctors and black neighborhoods.  If Chris W. and Keith O. use white doctors, then that&rsquo;s all the proof you  need that they are closet white supremacists. They shout &#8220;racism&#8221; as a cover.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hoax on multiple fronts.</p>
<p>We were told that integrated schools were the answer. When that didn&rsquo;t work, we were told that school lunches were the answer (remember the argument that kids couldn&rsquo;t learn on an empty stomach?). Then it became free breakfasts and after school programs. And lead in inner-city dwellings.</p>
<p>When that failed, we tried black teachers, black administrators, black principals, black school boards, and on and on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before but I fear we&rsquo;re going to have to endure every theory that replaces the previous failed theory until all the theories are exhausted and we&rsquo;re left with the reality of race.</p>
<p>How long that will take is anyone guess.</p>

		<p>Having served in the US military for many years it was my misfortune, in the last few years, to have to visit &#8220;AA&#8221; doctors. I remember one, a Lt Colonel, who would have the exam performed by a young Captain(usually white), then call you into his speciality clinic and read the notes what the younger MD wrote. Ask the Colonel a question and he would &#8220;jitterbug&#8221; around his office &amp; wave his arms into the air spouting verbage from the old &#8220;Amos &amp; Andy&#8221; show. My eyes were drawn to the little dance he did and the very, very cheap fake Rolex he wore. His degree was from an unheard of school of medicine and he&rsquo;s still with the military at this date.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Ask Michael Jackson about his black doctor&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and don&rsquo;t forget Kanye &#8216;George Bush Doesn&rsquo;t Care About Black People&rsquo; West&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s black doctor  &mdash;  after she shopped around for a doctor that finally said &#8216;yes&rsquo; to performing the surgery on her: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The operation, performed by Dr. Jan Adams, lasted eight hours, twice as long as expected.. leading other doctors to speculate that something may have gone wrong during the procedure. </p>
<p>According to a separate report&hellip; the California Medical Board sought to revoke Adams&rsquo;s physician and surgeon&rsquo;s certificate this year following multiple DUI arrests in recent years. </p>
<p>Adams was arrested again for DUI and&hellip; surrendered his California medical license following his multiple convictions for alcohol-related offenses&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yldc8dh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yldc8dh</a></p>
<p>Or the AA black that was admitted to medical school in place of Alan Bakke:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Patrick Chavis was the black applicant admitted to the University of California at Davis Medical School even though he had much weaker academic qualifications than Allan Bakke, a white applicant&hellip;One of Chavis&rsquo; plastic surgery patients bled to death.</p>
<p>Chavis eventually lost his medical license because of his gross negligence, incompetence, and &#8216;inability to perform some of the most basic duties required of a physician.&rsquo;..&#8221;</p>
<p>So yeah, I guess we need more Affirmative Action so more unqualified blacks can replace qualified Whites in medical school, makes perfect sense, just like all the other lies the government and media tell us&hellip;.</p>

<p><b>Lack of Black Doctors Traced Primarily to Pre-College Factors, Study Finds</b></p>
<p><br>
Oh, there are some &#8220;Pre-College Factors&#8221;, that&rsquo;s for sure. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pre-College Factors&#8221; like sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s having been an evolutionary flatliner   &mdash;   with a near-total lack of observable progress   &mdash;   since the Stone Age. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pre-College Factors&#8221; like Africans having spent the past few thousand years in a warm, lush, forgiving environment with no incentive for anybody to do anything other than dance around naked, pick the low-hanging fruit and spear the occasional zebra. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pre-College Factors&#8221; like the phrase &#8220;Necessity is the mother of invention&#8221; being (necessarily) of European, not African, origin. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Much of that overall gap can be traced to social and economic problems&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a relief. I was concerned that it was attributed to the fact that average black IQ is 15 points lower than the average White IQ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its actually far worse than that. Most medical students have IQs in the 130 range. The number of blacks who have IQs in that range is something like one in a million</p>

		<p>To elitist:&#8221;How many affluent Blacks have Black doctors?&#8221; Michael Jackson went out of his way to hire a Black doctor to go along with his Black chef,&#8221;nation of Islam&#8221; bodyguards and Black lawyer. That worked out alright .</p>

		<p>A long time ago, I heard a comedian make the following comment. &#8220;I vote Republican because I want an bunch of cranky old white guys watching my money&#8221;. I want the cranky old white guys watching who is allowed into medical school. We expect them to turn out competent doctors. If that means a starting IQ of 125, a 3.75 GPA and off the chart MCAT scores, so be it. It doesn&rsquo;t exactly inspire confidence if there is some doubt in your mind about competence. </p>
<p>Back in the 1970&rsquo;s, a number of medical schools went out of their way to try to increase the number of minority doctors through &#8220;special programs&#8221; (read: affirmative action). While it is still incredibly difficult to get into med school, at that time medical schools were bending over backwards to get in any marginally qualified minority candidate. This only came to a halt with the Bakke case. </p>
<p>Let us not forget the name of one black doctor, Patrick Chavis. Several years ago, he was the poster boy for Affirmative Action Medicine. Ted Kennedy was singing the praises of AA, when in reality he wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed Chavis to mow his lawn or walk his dog. While Chavis might have made a good account manager for a national retail chain, this man had no business in medicine. </p>
<p>Chavis fell from grace after a few botched liposuctions and numerous complaints about his ability to do his job. In 2002, his obituary ran in the NY Times about two months after he was &#8220;killed in a car-jacking&#8221;. To this day, there are no suspects are in custody. I wonder if this was a hit carried out by family members of one of his victims. The police may write it off as gang related so as not to open the pandora&rsquo;s box that would come from knowing the truth.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;It is also known as the &ldquo;Bridge Theory&rdquo;. That is, white people had access to better education facilities; and that academics, at these &ldquo;better institutions,&rdquo; educated white people (specifically males) how to operate in the occupational tiles&#8221;.</p>
<p>How is it discredited that a greater education translates into a higher income? Unless of course you mean by &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; whereby those with a lessor education are more likely to advance up the corporate and employment ladder? </p>

		<p>The solution couldn&rsquo;t be simpler&hellip; Just LOWER THE BAR! Why make college entrance exams and courses so demanding. Graduate MORE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION physicians. You don&rsquo;t have to actually trust your health to an affirmative action doctor.</p>

		<p>Would any of these &#8220;pre-college factors&#8221; include the utter inability of a government capable of spending arbitrary amounts of our money to wave a magic wand that will endow blacks with the dedication and intellectual accumen to become competant physicians?</p>
<p>It may just be me, but every time I hear about another black &#8220;youth&#8221; being gunned down by other young blacks, the deceased is never referred to as an &#8220;aspiring doctor&#8221;.  Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

		<p>The average physician has an IQ around 125, and 120 is quite adequate for med school.</p>
<p>Only ca 1% of blacks have IQs around 120 or higher, or a few hundred thousands.</p>
<p>Motivation, self-discipine, and dedication also count for a lot in medicine. </p>
<p>There are prominent and highly competent black doctors, and it would be dishonest to deny it. (bad doctors get into the news more often!)</p>
<p>The issue is the need to weed out incompetents, and that means an even playing field: <br>
one (high!) standard for all, and no exceptions.</p>
<p>It is tragic that resources are wasted on supbar med students to fill quotas. Most never make it through med shool, but many are good enough to be nurses, technicians, or other medical professionals. </p>
<p>Race quotas ruin lives in any number of ways.</p>
