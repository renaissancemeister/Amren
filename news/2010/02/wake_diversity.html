<h1>Wake Diversity Policy Stays For Now</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung Hui, News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A second attempt by the new Wake County school board majority to push through the elimination of busing for diversity in favor of neighborhood schools failed Wednesday when one of its members didn&rsquo;t back the change.</p>
<p>New school board member Debra Goldman again broke ranks with the majority when she killed a motion Wednesday by refusing to second proposed changes in the student assignment policy.</p>
<p>Goldman was also one of the members of the majority who backed down on adopting the changes when they were introduced Dec.1, right after the newcomers took office.</p>
<p>Goldman stressed Wednesday that she&rsquo;s still a critic of the current policy. But Goldman, who also split with the majority to pass a compromise resolution that doesn&rsquo;t completely ban mandatory year-round schools, said more &#8220;due diligence&#8221; needs to occur before the student assignment policy is changed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Goldman&rsquo;s position caused at least one group that supports the new board majority to say it&rsquo;s beginning to have doubts about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen this nightmare before, where new school board members do not vote to do what they said they were going to do in their campaigns,&#8221; said Dallas Woodhouse, state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, in a written statement.</p>
<p><b>Not in my melting pot</b></p>
<p>Wake has received national recognition for trying to balance the percentages of low-income, low-performing, special education and limited English proficient students at individual schools.</p>
<p>But opposition to the diversity policy helped fuel the election of Goldman and three other board members last fall. They formed a new majority with veteran board member Ron Margiotta.</p>
<p>The proposed changes eliminate all references to diversity and prioritize the formation of neighborhood schools. New school board member John Tedesco justified the change by saying the current policy isn&rsquo;t working.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wake has received national recognition for trying to balance the percentages of low-income, low-performing, special education and limited English proficient students at individual schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>With US students now near the bottom globally, why do these types feel as if concentration on social engineering is more important than teaching and learning?</p>
<p>Like the healthcare bill the US needs to break up and start all over again.  This time without the gullibles and fools.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have to be worrying much longer about the &#8220;social engineering&#8221; attempts by the far left.  Here in CA, we are bankrupt; the LAUSD has fired 7 out of 10 teachers (yes, that&rsquo;s 7/10 of the workforce!!) - so what several of us are going to do is get some parents together and form small home schooling groups in the neighborhoods, no more than 10 kids to a class.  Homeschooling is legal, and since we have teaching credentials, we&rsquo;re legal too.  Parents can pay us by the day, they can pay for the kids&rsquo; materials, and we&rsquo;ll give them an education they&rsquo;d NEVER be able to get in public school.  Watch those test scores rise, folks!!  (And we won&rsquo;t put up with any kind of obnoxious behavior by any kid; a kid who can&rsquo;t behave gets kicked out, period end of report).</p>

		<p>IIRC this election was about one issue- busing- and it was heartening to see the good guys win.</p>
<p>For this woman to now flip-flop and support busing would be like Scott Brown voting for Obamacare.</p>

<p>I for one could pay very well for what you offer, and WOULD pay very well for it. My boys are both grown and did very well in school, but I think you have an idea that will appeal to many people, a great many people I would think.</p>
