			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pharoh Martin, Wilmington Journal, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NAACP, the world&rsquo;s oldest civil rights organization, has given the U. S. Congress an overall grade of B- on its annual Civil Rights Report Card for the first session of the 111th Congress Jan. 6, 2009  &mdash;  Dec. 24, 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are moving in the right direction, unfortunately, they are still being bottlenecked by some of the challenges of getting agreements with both sides of the aisle,&#8221; said Hilary Shelton, NAACP Washington Bureau chief, who has been helping to oversee the report card for the last 12 years. &#8220;Some of the progress that we&rsquo;d seen has become much more partisan-divided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 1914, the non-partisan civil rights organization&rsquo;s Congressional Legislative Report Card has graded the U.S. Congress on how they vote on what the NAACP deems as &#8220;bread and butter&#8221; civil rights legislation.</p>
<p>Congressional members are graded on how often they voted in agreement with the 100-year-old organization.</p>
<p>The current report card, released last week, shows an increase of the overall congressional grade from the previous year, but still not the kind of progress to make major impact on centuries of racial oppression.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the current report card, 59 percent of Senators and 47 percent of Representatives received an &#8220;A&#8221;, a marked improvement from the previous report card on which 29 percent of Senators and 34 percent of Representatives received a failing grade of &#8220;F&#8221; on the report card.</p>
<p>The Senate was graded on 21 votes of which five were confirmation votes such as high-profile appointments like Hilary Clinton for secretary of state, Eric Holder for attorney general and Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In both chambers the voting patterns of Republicans and Democrats were starkly different in their support of civil rights.</p>
<p>Out of 40 Republican senators, all received Fs, except three. Only Maine&rsquo;s moderate Republican senators, Olympia Snowe (R- Maine) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), received passing grades, both receiving a &#8216;C&rsquo; at 76 percent. George Lemieux (R-Fla.) received a grade of incomplete because he took over Mel Martinez&rsquo; senatorial seat in September. Martinez resigned to become secretary of the interior.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conversely, Robert Byrd (D-WV) is the only Democratic senator to receive a failing grade with 48 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} All 40 voting members of the Congressional Black Caucus received an A except one  &mdash;  Artur Davis (D-Ala.), who got a B with only 80 percent, one point above a C.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Shelton] concludes: &#8220;We&rsquo;ll be looking at racial profiling. We are preparing a bill that will be introduced very soon that will take on that issue. We are be looking at additional health care issues and getting the omnibus health care bill through.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>What percentage of the U.S. population is black?  Is it 17%, as I think I read not too long ago?  All right - that measures out to 17 Senators, and if I remember right, out of 465 Reps that&rsquo;d be no more than 33.  These numbers are what blacks should have, no more and no less.  That&rsquo;s fair.  It won&rsquo;t happen, because most people are wise to the corruption and graft that plague most black people in positions of power, like a U.S. Senator or Rep.  That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t get elected; the NAACP ought to focus on changing the behavior of its people before demanding equality, because the performances of their people in elected offices to date is NOT equal to that of whites.  They need to face some facts before demanding something that isn&rsquo;t theirs to demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;the NAACP ought to focus on changing the behavior of its people before demanding equality, because the performances of their people in elected offices to date is NOT equal to that of whites. They need to face some facts before demanding something that isn&rsquo;t theirs to demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP is smarter than you credit them. They know that they will never change the behavior of their people, because they are of their people, and know themselves. They are shakedown artists and thugs. They inherited it from Africa. </p>
<p>But the NAACP has a special intelligence- they know a weaker race when they see one, and that&rsquo;s how they intimidate whites into eventually giving up what they created for themselves and their own children.</p>
<p>Whites are genetically predisposed to fair play and cooperation, and they make the fatal error of assuming all races are the same as they are. That whites would ever take seriously the fantasy that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221; is proof that we are doomed by our own stupidity, and we deserve what is to come. Just make sure liberal elite whites are on the front end of the reception. They aren&rsquo;t now, but should be. When you hear a white saying anything that sounds like &#8220;we need to do more to foster diversity and help minorities,&#8221; you are hearing a white who should never be allowed to live in a white neighborhood, marry his white daughter off to a white man, pray in a white church, and work for a white boss. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Any police officer will tell you that criminals see  niceness and a weakness to be exploited, and NAACP knows that whites can&rsquo;t withstand being called racist. Whites cave in to NAACP demands in favor of blacks, proving our niceness is a weakness and demise.</p>
<p>If blacks can demand it from us and get it just by shouting a little louder, who are we to say they shouldn&rsquo;t get it?<br/>

		<p>Where are folks(AR Readers)here getting this 17% figure of Blacks in the US population. Of late, I have seen this mentioned several times, so it cannot be a fluke. Last I knew, Blacks were approximately 12.5% of the US population, some present the number as low as 12% and some as high as 13%. Never, anywhere have I heard this 17% figure. </p>
<p>I am curious where this is coming from from. </p>

		<p>3 Hank:</p>
<p>I have floated 17% as an educated guess here on AR, and I think where most people here get it is through their own intuition and educated guesses.  The reason I think 12-13% is too low is because blacks predominate every major inner core of a population center in the United States.  Black civil rights groups are right when they say that the official counts undercount blacks, because blacks don&rsquo;t send in the census forms like they should, mainly because of ignorance, but also perhaps a fear of creating a paper trail that will lead to a household member with warrants for his arrest being caught, welfare benefits being revoked, illiteracy, and so on.  Even if you send the census taker out on the streets (how would you like to have that job, to go running around North St. Louis or South Chicago or Anywhere Kansas City even during the middle of the day), it&rsquo;s impossible to get anywhere close to an accurate count.  Do you think &#8220;Shaniqua&#8221; is even going to answer the door when a white man with clipboard in hand rings the doorbell or knocks on the door?  For all she knows, it&rsquo;s a U/C cop wanting to snoop for drugs or arrest live-in boyfriend du jour N&rsquo;Deshawntavious.</p>

		<p>How about they let us grade the NAACP! If I were one of those being graded by these illiterate racists in the NAACP, I&rsquo;d tell them to their faces that I hope they give me an F every year, and would make that one of my goals while in office.  </p>

		<p>This seems like as good a place as any to post a VDARE story link concerning the black-on-white MASS MURDER in Arkansas last November, and how the state-run media is not covering what happened to those poor whites at the hands of evil black racists:</p>

		<p>The only states where blacks have the same opportunity as whites to purchase firearms (legally) are Vermont and Alaska.  Even the so-called &#8220;shall-issue&#8221; states prohibit their use, and often possession, by convicted felons.  This alone disqualifies blacks at at least ten times the rate of whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet dollars to dogfights that combating this particular discrimination didn&rsquo;t make their shortlist of &#8220;bread-and-butter civil rights legislation&#8221;!</p>

<p>I travel all over the U.S. on a motorcycle (when I am at home) and I assure you the population of blacks in the U.S. IS MORE LIKE 40%, higher in some large cities. I think the ratio of black to white is more readily apparent if one goes into any government office and look at the staff! I think the government is keeping the real % of blacks concealed so as not to alarm the White population to a Zimbabwe or SA type of thinking.</p>
