<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1252145/David-Camerons-plan-impose-women-gays-ethnic-candidates.html">Tories&rsquo; Secret Plan to Kill Off Party Dinosaurs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail, February 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A confidential blueprint for David Cameron&rsquo;s controversial bid to impose more women, gays and ethnic candidates on reluctant party activists has come to light.</p>
<p>The explosive six-page document proposes the use of subterfuge to end the white, male and middle-class image of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>It emerged on the eve of another grassroots revolt over the modernisation of the party.</p>
<p>Action Plan for Candidate Selection in Safe Seats is a fascinating insight into how modernisers have planned a gradual Tory party takeover.</p>
<p>Their efforts finally paid off last month when Mr Cameron imposed shortlists of &#8216;suitable&rsquo; Parliamentary candidates.</p>
<p>The move has incensed the grassroots  &mdash;  who have always had a say over which candidates appeared on shortlists  &mdash;  and triggered a wave of protests and resignations.</p>
<p>And the language in the document will further exacerbate tensions between the Tory high command and its army of hard working volunteers.</p>
<p>The document suggests using &#8216;stealth&rsquo; and stresses the importance of keeping &#8216;quiet&rsquo; over the plans to ensure more women, ethnic and gay candidates. &#8216;Like a conjuror, we&rsquo;ll get more applause if the audience cannot see exactly how the trick is performed,&rsquo; the document says.</p>
<p>It was written by Tory schools spokesman Michael Gove, an influential member of Mr Cameron&rsquo;s inner circle, and Dean Godson, a director of favoured think-tank Policy Exchange.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A huge turnout from the 900-strong association is expected this evening to select a candidate.</p>
<p>But the list imposed by Tory Central Office means they have a choice of four women (none of whom has ever fought a Parliamentary seat), one of ethnic origin and only one local (white) man. Many Stratford-upon-Avon Tories, represented over the years by John Profumo and Angus Maude (a member of Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s first Cabinet), are opposed to the way Cameron has changed selection procedure.</p>
<p>It has been dubbed the battle of the Stratford Squireachy and the Cameron Cuties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr Cameron is unrepentant and his decision to seize power from local associations, say his friends, is the culmination of the secret plan on how to neuter the party faithful in the country.</p>
<p>These members of the Tory grassroots, cruelly nicknamed dinosaurs, are seen by modernisers as impediments to a progressive party. Mr Gove&rsquo;s and Mr Godson&rsquo;s document was written in February 2002.</p>
<p><b>David Cameron</b></p>
<p>Conservative party leader David Cameron wants to end the white male middle class image of his party</p>
<p>But even Shadow Cabinet ministers concede it has been hugely influential and the central platform of Mr Cameron&rsquo;s programme. The paper accepts it was not the fault of local associations that so many white men were being chosen.</p>
<p>&#8216;Most of the talented candidates on the list are white and male,&rsquo; it states. &#8216;The principal reason such people get selected for safe seats is because they tend to be the best on offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;The clever approach is to maintain the illusion that a good cross-section of approved candidates is being offered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suggesting a degree of subterfuge, the document goes on: &#8216;There are several reasons why the Party should not publicly proclaim the new methodology.</p>
<p>&#8216;The more that the profusion of women, black, Asian or gay candidates appears to be the result of spontaneous open-mindedness on the part of grassroot activists the greater will be the accolades.</p>

		<p>I no longer feel any sympathy for indigenous, white Britons. They have now been told to their collective faces what is being done to them. Labour recently admitted they opened the immigration floodgates on purpose and now the Tories admit they are going to finish the job. They no longer can claim they didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. God Save The Queen? To h*ll with the Queen. God Save Britain!</p>

		<p>The idiocy coming out of Britain these days is very disappointing.  I once thought that the Brits were superiorly educated - but no longer.  If they were up to thinking about it, they&rsquo;d take a good hard look at all that &#8220;diversity&#8221; has brought them   &mdash;   and once the EVIDENCE was all in, they&rsquo;d abandon the plan to change the party face.  Here in SoCA diversity has brought us ghettos, barrios, the collapse of our educational, health, and welfare systems, graffitti, gang violence, numbers of standing phallic symbols in front of supposed houses of worship, and occasional beheadings of recalcitrant females   &mdash;   that enough for ya?</p>

		<p>Good news for the BNP.  If one candidate is a single Nigerian mother, the second a Paki muslim and the third a radical Lesbian a plain old Englishman might seem a great choice.</p>

		<p>Wow&hellip;..I don&rsquo;t know which is more breathtaking and disturbing.  The sheer arrogance and malevolence of this or the sheer ignorance of the state of the country.</p>
<p>I see Britain as a place where the majority of the white population is becoming desperate, seeing no future there, especially not for their children.  They are very close to concluding (correctly I might add) that their only hope is to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>These people expect &#8220;accolades&#8221; from the people.  What they are going to get is a gallows.  Despite all evidence to the contrary (a plummeting standard of living being the most obvious), they see what they are doing as right.</p>

<p>I thought that Conservatives weren&rsquo;t <i>supposed</i> to be &#8220;progressive&#8221;.  At least in the United States &#8220;progressive&#8221; is simply a synonym for &#8220;socialist&#8221;.  (Socialism became a bad word so an alternative had to be found.)  As in the United States all the major parties are eager to sell out white people.</p>
<p>I sure hope the BNP gives this bit of news plenty of publicity.<br>

		<p>Common sense says that every white male will be really insulted and react accordingly but I have this nasty suspicion that no one will really care, as it&rsquo;s {yawn} toooo much trouble to interupt their routine. The motion will pass as will the politcal life of the UK.<br>
On election day if they happen to remember to vote, this motion will be long forgotten &amp; they will vote for the party mum &amp; dad voted for.  So sad!!</p>

		<p>No Brit with a shred of dignity would vote anything other than the BNP. You can tinker this way or that with the welfare system later, but once your country has been sold out to the immigrant invasion it is gone for good. Pakistan has 3x as many people as Great Britain, and India 20x as many. They can swamp your tiny island in a minute without feeling the loss.</p>

		<p>Hm, and I wonder where all these whites are going to go now that the hatred the tory party for them has become apparent?  Once again that mental image of Nick Griffin laughing at a polling booth keeps popping up.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several reasons why the Party should not publicly proclaim the new methodology.&#8221;</p>
<p>A bit late for that now, it&rsquo;s been carried as front page news in multiple papers.</p>

<p>This, of course, isn&rsquo;t just about the numbers or quantity of the immigrants from India and Pakistan. IT&rsquo;s also about the quality of that immigration. There are many places in India where a person feeling the need to defecate will relieve themselves on the street, and the others will feel it&rsquo;s only normal. Such values are quite incompatible with Western values.</p>

		<p> I can assure you that the Republican Party, America&rsquo;s counterpart to the Tories, is engaged in the same enterprise of trying to marginalize whites(their voter base) and fill &#8220;safe&#8221; seats in elected offices with a &#8220;rainbow coalition&rsquo; of minority candidates. Hate your base hard enough, Republican leaders, and they will learn to hate you back. The Democrats could never have come up with a more effective plan for destroying the electoral prospects of the Republican Party than the one that the Republican leadership has apparently come up with themselves-Michael Steele, the black head of the GOP, being exhibit 1. It will be interesting to sit back and watch while the GOP and the Tories commit suicide, while third parties like the BNP and the Tea Partiers grow at their expense. Grab a bag of popcorn and get a front row seat!</p>
