<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/11/bnp-nonwhites-members-sikh-join">&#8216;Every Hindu and Sikh Should Be Praising the BNP&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Kleeman, The Guardian (London), February 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rajinder Singh is flicking through the Pakistani channels on his Sky box from his sofa in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Dressed in a crimson turban, he sits a metre from the _enormous screen, translating the odd phrase for my benefit. He&rsquo;s trying to show me why he&rsquo;s determined to join the British National Party  &mdash;  the only party he considers &#8220;brave&#8221; enough to &#8220;break out of the burkha called _political correctness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Last year, the Equality and _Human Rights Commission forced the BNP to change its constitution on the grounds that restricting membership to _&#8221;indigenous Caucasians&#8221; broke the Race Relations Act. A new constitution is expected to be agreed at a party meeting this Sunday, and if it&rsquo;s amended both Singh and the BNP think he would be ideal as the party&rsquo;s first non-white _recruit. Communications and campaigns _officer Martin Wingfield has personally endorsed him on his blog, calling for the party to &#8220;adapt and survive and give the brave and loyal Rajinder Singh the honour of becoming the first ethnic minority member&#8221;.</p>
<p>Singh is a 78-year-old Sikh, a retired primary school teacher and a father of two, who left India for the UK in 1967. He says he&rsquo;s been loyal to the BNP since he first heard BNP leader Nick Griffin on television in late 2001. &#8220;He used the word &#8216;Islam&rsquo;. And I thought, &#8216;He&rsquo;s brave, he has conviction,&rsquo;&#8221; Singh says. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;It&rsquo;s amazing what you&rsquo;ve said: I&rsquo;ve always been thinking that, since my childhood.&rsquo;&#8221; He wrote Griffin letters of support and eventually provided him with a character reference at his 2005 trial for inciting racial hatred. Singh has voted for the BNP in every local and general election since discovering them. &#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t keep away.&#8221;</p>
<p>It feels strange to hear these words from a man in a turban, but Singh _admits he&rsquo;s only wearing it for my _benefit. He&rsquo;s not a religious man and is clean shaven, but he wore a turban the first time he ever had &#8220;media exposure&#8221;  &mdash;  on BNPTV, the party&rsquo;s online _channel  &mdash;  and has decided to do so whenever speaking to the media because &#8220;the message carries more weight&#8221; coming from a turban-wearing Sikh.</p>
<p>His &#8220;message&#8221; is simple and _depressingly familiar: he fears that Britain is becoming an Islamic republic, and Islam is dangerous. &#8220;Most of them behave very nicely, but suddenly when they get together in the mosque and _listen to the preaching, they acquire a collective identity that is formidable. It&rsquo;s the collective being that frightens me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Islamophobia is not uncommon among Hindu and Sikh immigrants, but Singh&rsquo;s personal history makes his all the more acute. Born in West Punjab in 1931, he witnessed the violence of Indian partition firsthand. Millions of Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims were killed during partition, his father among them, murdered when Singh was only 15. He lays the blame squarely with Muslims. Why doesn&rsquo;t he blame the British, the architects of partition? _&#8221;Britain had a role to play,&#8221; he concedes, &#8220;but the violence sprang from the Koran. The Muslim answer to reasoned argument is knife, dagger and bomb.&#8221;</p>
<p>This thinking gives Singh an affinity with even the most diehard BNP members. He&rsquo;s been to several party meetings and says he never feels awkward in their company. &#8220;They treat me normally,&#8221; he insists. &#8220;I feel at home.&#8221; I ask if he thinks many BNP members can tell the difference between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims. &#8220;They might think of me as a Paki,&#8221; he replies. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had people shout &#8216;Paki Go Home!&rsquo; when I walk down the street. But that speaks much about the &#8216;Paki&rsquo; reputation  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a negative reaction to Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to BNP policy, Singh knows what he&rsquo;ll be endorsing with his membership. He thinks voluntary _repatriation in exchange for cash would be &#8220;something excellent, something supreme&#8221; because only those who are truly loyal to the UK would choose to stay here rather than take the money. When I ask about BNP plans to give &#8220;native Britons&#8221; preference in the job market, he says this has always been unofficially the case, and spelling it out in law won&rsquo;t make any real difference to the lives of people such as him.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t the BNP racist, I ask? &#8220;Pre-amendment, yes,&#8221; he replies. &#8220;They are trying to soften up. Shouldn&rsquo;t the nation welcome that? It&rsquo;s a positive move if they get people like me, and if I&rsquo;m sitting in a BNP meeting they won&rsquo;t say &#8216;Throw all of them out&rsquo; because they&rsquo;ll realise one of &#8216;them&rsquo; is among &#8216;us&rsquo;.&#8221; But the BNP were forced to extend their membership beyond &#8220;indigenous Caucasians&#8221;, they didn&rsquo;t choose to. Surely they still feel the same about non-whites? &#8220;Initially the child is forced to go to school, then it becomes his habit, and then he voluntarily goes when he sees the point of it,&#8221; says Singh.</p>
<p>Fellow Sikhs have shunned him, but Singh thinks they are misguided. &#8220;Every Hindu and Sikh comes from a country that was a victim of Islamic aggression,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Every Hindu and Sikh should be praising the BNP and thanking God that something has appeared that may guarantee that this country is not overwhelmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP are hungry for a more _acceptable face, and they recognise Singh may be the perfect person to provide it: he&rsquo;s an articulate man with a readily exploitable, deep-seated bitterness. It&rsquo;s clear to me that they&rsquo;ve used him whenever they&rsquo;ve needed to appear legitimate  &mdash;  at Griffin&rsquo;s trial, and now that they face legal action if they fail to change their constitution. &#8220;I may be being exploited,&#8221; Singh says, &#8220;but there&rsquo;s a good underlying cause. They will be diluted.&#8221; Then he smiles. &#8220;All parties use people. If they don&rsquo;t, they will fail.&#8221;<br>

<p>Well, perhaps. But what Mister Singh seems not to understand, or to prefer to ignore (why?), is that the objective of the BNP is to prevent britain being overwhelmed, yes, but not just by Pakistani Muslims, but by every kind of non-White immigrants!</p>

		<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, good for the BNP.  I wish it weren&rsquo;t this way, and that the BNP could be for whites only advocating for whites only.  However, official and unofficial Britain will evidently drive them out of existence if nothing changes.  These changes mean that the BNP can have 80% of the strength to fight 80% of the battle.  While it would be nice to have 100% of the strength to fight 100% of the battle, going that route will get you 0% of the strength to fight 0% of the battle.  Statesmen need to win elections sometimes, as the old saying goes.</p>

		<p>As long as Griffin and the BNP maintain their policy of returning whites to an overwhelming(over 90%) majority, I don&rsquo;t care and neither should any other white.</p>
<p>Far as I know, Griffin explicitly stated that even if they had to let non-whites in they were still a pro-white party(excuse me, pro-indigenous).  His willingness to appear at the amren conference is proof of this if nothing else is.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted here before that the very few enlightened minorities who recognise the racial source of their well being should be allowed to join. But let&rsquo;s not get carried away.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt anything &amp; it avoids costly litigation. But also let&rsquo;s not place too much emphasis on this tiny &#8220;trend.&#8221; The BNP can be tolerant w/o getting side-tracked by minority &#8220;friends.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>There are a lot of sikhs in Los Angeles.  They look like standard Whites to me.  They are somewhat lighter in complexion that most Indians, either hindu or muslim.</p>
<p>But in Britian I guess they are classified as Asians.</p>

		<p>In the very first paragraph it says that Mr. Singh was &#8220;Dressed in a crimson turban&#8221; while watching TV. Then the article goes on to say that he moved from India to the UK back in 1967. That means he had been living in Britain for over 40 years, but still apparently insists on wearing garb that is completely alien to any Western country. After all, the Sikh religion originated on the Indian sub-continent and is practiced mainly by Punjabis, and they do not actively seek to convert people of other ethnicities. Some people, including those who support the BNP will say that turbans, muslim head-scarfs and the like are just pieces of fabric and that no one should really get worked up about them. But I disagree, for if I were a women that decided to move to say Iran, the locals there would not accommodate me by allowing myself to not to cover my hair or wear mini-skirts. So if non-western countries can do that, why can&rsquo;t we insist that people who voluntarily decide to live in our midst dress in culturally appropriate attire?! </p>

<p> I agree, some minorities see what the source of their well being is and are grateful. Hindu Indians seem to be very reasonable in this view.</p>

		<p>Hindus, Buddists, Jews, as well as racial groups like the Chinese are not trying to take over and transform the country and for the most part do not cause widespread trouble with gangs, drugs and welfare dependency. I have no problems wandering alone through Chinatown,but you won&rsquo;t catch me anywhere near Broadwater Farm Estate or Brick lane because a) I&rsquo;d feel unwelcome and 2)I&rsquo;d feel unsafe; additionally these places have nothing that I would want. None of the other above mentioned relig/racial groups pose a threat to the culture and traditions of the West, they are small in number, generally peaceful offering the best of their culture with a smile. If they want to join the BNP and uphold British people&rsquo;s way of life so be it.</p>

		<p>Sikhs, Hindus, Jews etc&hellip; have a common enemy in Islam just like Europeans (and even non-Whites)of Christian heritage. How ever and an alliance to deal with the Islamic menace is understandable. However we must not forget that our aim is to remove ALL nonwhites from Europe including the Sikhs. Sikhs may be honest, brave and friendly as a people (unlike other south Asians who have a tendency to be sneaky and cunning) but they are not European. They are invaders too. As far as Sikhs looking like Whites, yes they do tend to be more Caucasian looking by Indian standards but there is a lot of variation among them. I have seen many Dark skinned Sikhs with aboriginal-Dravidian features but over all they are much more Caucasian looking and better built then the average Indian. But they are not of European ancestry.</p>

		<p>Anglophile definition&hellip;<br>
a person who strongly admires England or its people, culture, customs, influence, etc.<br>
No more so than Indians of Mr Singh&rsquo;s generation who actually loved their English schooling acquired in India provided by real English teachers but this does not apply to inhabitants of Pakistan and Bangladesh. I cannot help but contrast this love of education with the sad situation in Britain today when the majority of students, especially immigrants, despise school, teachers, education, discipline and, indeed, anything remotely useful and complain about being &#8216;bored init&rsquo;. The BNP has been targeted by our communist labour party and their absolute devotion to bringing in millions of illiterates who are alien to our culture, language and way of life in a declared intention of &#8216;spiting the right&rsquo;. As soon as the BNP membership rules have been changed to suit the same people who insist that our fishermen dump perfectly good and fresh, but dead, fish back into the sea because of EU rules, then the sooner we can buckle down to outing this fetid bunch of cheats and scoundrels along with their appointed alien ministers, many of whom have already been thrown out of office because of corruption. Perhaps the rules should also be changed in respect of muslim criminals who are still in UK living on housing and cash benefits despite promises that they will be deported. They are represented by lawyers, themselves muslim, paid for by the state. Meanwhile, our troops who were injured and maimed fighting the same alien hordes are still fighting here in UK to be granted decent medical treatment, housing and compensation. These rule changes by the BNP are only a natural political progression and a minor partial victory for our communist government who totally ignore other, far more important matters which really deserve attention but use the BNP to distract the UK population away from the real issues facing our broken society.  An absolute proof of the pro-islamic immigration policy is the disgusting treatment of the Gurkha soldiers (Nepalese, not muslim) who have loyally served the British Army for generations but were threatened with expulsion, along with their wives and children, once they retired on a much reduced pension, far less than the cost of housing and feeding imported, uneducated, alien non-English speaking muslims immigrants with their multiple wives and huge families. So.. welcome to the only genuine British political party Mr Singh, and the best of British to you!!</p>

		<p>The important thing to recognise here is that this &#8216;law&rsquo; which forces the BNP to allow non-whites to become members, was not voted for by the people, it was voted into place by a tiny handful of politicians. The people of the U.K. weren&rsquo;t clamouring for the &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; laws, the government FORCED them on us, and they are therefore undemocratic, and tyrannous.</p>

		<p>The Sikhs and Hindus have respect for Britian. They do not sell heroin to white teenagers like the Pakistani&rsquo;s do. They do not turn an area into a little version of India, like the Pakistani&rsquo;s do. They are responsible for very few race crimes against whites, unlike the blacks who live here. Good for you Mr Singh!</p>

		<p>Most non-Moslem people of Indian derivation are law-abiding, non-troublesome individuals.  As long as the BNP can keep itself from being taken over by Moslems and turned into the next jihadi party, it should welcome anyone who shares traditional British values.  It sounds to me like Pakis are the biggest minority problem the U.K. has.  Well, you can bet there&rsquo;s no love lost between them and Sikhs and Hindus!</p>

		<p>I will make a prediction: this is the beginning of the end of the BNP. Its whole purpose will be side tracked from being a pro white British movement to a &#8220;we aren&rsquo;t a bunch of racists&#8221; and having to prove it time and again. Another thing to remember is that Hindus and Muslims don&rsquo;t like each other very much. This Sikh sees BNP as any ally against his Islamic enemies. But wait until some Muslim wants to join the BNP. They will be forced to take him; it&rsquo;s racism and discrimination not to. On and on this will go until BNP is completely useless for its original purpose.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why doesn&rsquo;t he blame the British?&#8221;     Perhaps because it wasn&rsquo;t the British who killed his father. <br>
What a precious example of modern &#8220;journalism&#8221;! </p>
<p>As for concern that this could be the beginning of the end for the BNP, so what?  The important thing is for them to make significant changes in Britain in the direction of their goals.  If they can do this, then in the future perhaps it will become legal once again to form parties that represent the interests of indigenous Britons without reserve.   </p>
<p>It should be normal, as it ever was through the centuries until the most recent times, that EVERY party in Britain is naturally composed entirely of indigenous Britons, rather than the existence of even a single such party being considered a shocking, intolerable surprise, as it is by so many today.  </p>
<p>May the British remember their fathers, consider their children, and realize who they are.  </p>

		<p>Hey ..its a little Macchiavelian&hellip;but it just might work* I&rsquo;m no scholar on the current Euro mind set but I&rsquo;m guessing they may have had enough fun with the diversity party for a while. About 15 yrs ago at a bar in upstate NY I was talking to a young English camp counsler who was here on a temp work visa. He commented on how Racist Americans were. I asked him why he said that&hellip; he went on about we&rsquo;re all human or something&hellip;  I said I agree.. No one should put any down&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t go out with a black woman but I certainly wish them well. He almost lost his stomach&hellip; He felt I was racist too&hellip; I said how is that racist? He said he had black family&hellip; I said.. I&rsquo;m sorry, but you didn&rsquo;t look black at all to me. He meant through marriage.. but he had plenty turmoil inside. Whether because he felt I was wrong or right I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>The people traded security for peace and now will get neither.</p>
<p>The BNP tried to rise up, but most whites didn&rsquo;t follow through with the BNP.  </p>
<p>The U.S. and Canada are making the same trade.  </p>

If someone agrees with the BNP on every aspect of its ideaology and isn&rsquo;t white, so what? I personally don&rsquo;t have a problem with non-whites joining the BNP as long as they don&rsquo;t try to remake it into something it&rsquo;s not.</b></p>
<p>I disagree.  Once you start having a sizable number of people from a different race than the members of a group, there will be a conflict of interest eventually.  Malcolm X, while being pro white I obviously disagreed with his anti-white agenda, didn&rsquo;t want the help of whites even if they were sympathetic to the causes of blacks.  Same with me.  Even if a non-white is sympathetic to our cause, while I appreciate it, it defers from the foundation of the BNP which is to be pro-white and keep Great Britain majority white and in the interests of whites.  Make sense?  Because if the BNP caves in now to let some blacks in to say &#8220;hey, we&rsquo;re not racist, see?&#8221; what other demands will they cave in on and what other ideals are they going to compromise?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hindus, Buddists, Jews, as well as racial groups like the Chinese are not trying to take over and transform the country and for the most part do not cause widespread trouble with gangs, drugs and welfare dependency. &#8220;</p>
<p>Arcadian, obviously you never have read history books. Christians have suffered and will continue to suffer at the hands of all four groups, and as Belloc said, &#8220;Europe is the Faith, the Faith, Europe.&#8221; While most Anglo/Europeans may not consider themselves followers of the Messiah anymore, the REST of the world sees it as &#8216;the white man&rsquo;s religion,&rsquo; and will hate us for that very reason.</p>
<p>I strongly beg to differ on your opinion.</p>

		<p>The forced capitulation of the BNP by the majority non-White-led UK race commission board, ie, the non-Whites only interest based so-called Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission, is not any kind of victory at all and there is no point in trying to present it as one.</p>
<p>As a result of this witch-hunt conducted by the non-White colonisers and their indigenous and traitorous White Marxist enablers, non-Whites of every race and culture have now been force granted access to membership so as to infiltrate and destroy it from within which includes non-White Third World Muslims and self-loathing traitorous White Leftists.  </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the BNP still insist on its core principles being upheld which are to champion and preserve indigenous Britons and their cultures. These will very soon be ridden roughshod over.  Gradually, the enabled non-White race commission board will also force them to rescind this BNP constitutional ruling too.  After all, newly empowered non-White members are not going to support such principles.  However, any counter-balancing attempts by White BNP members to secure the abolition of non-White self-interest associations and their race-based privilege quangos, will be shot down in flames each and every time.  One rule for the invader/colonisers and quite another for the hapless indigenous British, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I sound dispondent, even overly so, but one must face reality and the truth of the situation as it unfolds.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, only uprisings on the part of White natives along the lines of those initiated by <i>Civil Rights</i> agitating Black and Asian invaders into White ancestral homelands across the world, will stand any chance of overthrowing the present political system and installing rightful native ethnoNationalist alternatives once again.<br>
