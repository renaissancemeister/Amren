<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-affirm16-2010feb16,0,6120034.story">Federal Suit Planned Against UC Over Ban on Affirmative Action</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, February 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seeking to increase the ranks of black, Latino and Native American students at the University of California, civil rights activists said they will file a federal lawsuit Tuesday challenging the state law that bans affirmative action in admissions.</p>
<p>The suit contends that Proposition 209, which was passed by California voters in 1996, violates equal protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and says it has limited the numbers of non-Asian minority students at UC&rsquo;s most selective campuses. The suit also criticizes the university system for relying too heavily on high school grades and test scores in admissions, saying that the practice discriminates against students from schools without strong honors classes and counseling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>George Washington, a Detroit-based attorney for the group, said the legal environment has changed enough in recent years that his case can succeed. He cited the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2003 decision in a case involving the University of Michigan&rsquo;s law school, which allowed colleges to consider race as a factor in admissions as long as they do not use quotas.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Federal Suit Planned Against UC Over Ban on Affirmative Action&#8221;</p>
<p>This is part of the failure of multiculturalism and leftist ideology in general. This is how it will be from now on. The gigantic pandoras box of &#8220;progressive&#8221; goodies has been opened and nothing that comes out of it, will ever be able to be put back until some crisis is reached. In California that crisis is already here. No form of subterfuge or distraction by the politicians and elite, be it football, baseball, soccer, basketball, reality TV shows, soap operas,etc., is going to hide from the citizens, the inexorable march to financial ruin and instability that the State of California is going to end up in. I swear, I honestly wish, it would be otherwise, because I love this state, and because I have seen it at another time, when it was at its best, so I definetly have something to compare it to now. It&rsquo;s process of &#8220;becoming&#8221; something else, is really quite scary. </p>

		<p>You know, I hope this lawsuit succeeds.  In fact, I want all our state colleges to admit people not by scores, but by a racial quota system.  The atmosphere will change into something akin to extended ghetto high school.  Whites will flee and Asians will become the new oppresive priviledged class.  Then employers will know across the board that they should only hire those from private colleges.  I&rsquo;m at the point now in my frustration with all this racial mess that I&rsquo;m willing to let them have their way, and we more civilized people can associate amongst ourselves in private settings.  The whites in Brazil do this - they pretty much live, work and socialize isolated from the rest.  We will have to do this too.</p>

		<p>It is practically indisputable that race-based affirmative action negatively impacts the admissions prospects of whites, Jews, Asians and other groups that are over-represented on college campuses, in favor of other ethnic minorities like blacks and Hispanics.  IT&rsquo;s true that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment forbids government institutions, such as public universities, from discriminating on the basis of race.  BUT the amendment has no sub-clause granting exceptions to discriminate in favor of races that the college administrators deem more desirable.  <br>
In the Grutter case, in a very confusing opinion, Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor basically admitted her opinion violated the 14TH Amendment and basically said that &#8220;diversity&#8221; out weighed the Constitution and &#8220;We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary&hellip;&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Any reasonable reading of the equal protection clause makes it clear that affirmative action by the government is unconstitutional.  But we live in a very Orwellian world, and with the notorious 9th district court hearing the case I fear that the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and [Illegal] Immigrant Rights may well win.</p>

		<p>Jake poster#3, I believe that after Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor stated that we would not need racial preferences after twenty five years from the time she made the statement, she qualified her statement by saying that it might take longer or it might be an indefinite amount of time. I&rsquo;m not one-hundred percent sure, but I think she said this.</p>

		<p>I wonder when White people in this country will ever wake up and demand an end to affirmative action policies and racial set-asides that discrimate against them in college admissions, law and medical schools, and in the workplace.  Somehow they have to wake up and make this a priority.  About a week or so ago I looked up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on line and saw that this billionaire must really hate White people.  The Gates Millenium Scholarship fund, according to its official website&rsquo;s frequently asked questions section, ONLY provides scholorships to African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander or Hispanic American applicants.  It totally excludes Caucasians! You would think there would be some outrage over this outright discrimination against White kids but there isn&rsquo;t.  I sent an email to the O&rsquo;Reilly Factor&rsquo;s talking head, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, asking him to mention this as part of his nightly Patriot or Pinhead segment of his show.  Well, don&rsquo;t hold your breath.  None of these so called conservative pundits care to talk about this subject.  I would have written my represenatative in Congress but after speaking with his representative on the phone I believe it is useless.  The airhead I talked to said that because it is a private fund, Mr. Gates can give his money to whomever he pleases.  Can you imagine the outcry if that Gates Millenium Scholarship Fund was only for White kids and excluded ALL minorities.  It would be all over the world in a New York Minute.  The talking heads, Liberals and Conservatives alike, would be foaming at the mouth.  The elites at our Ivy League universities and in our government would be screaming for the head of Bill Gates, but since young White kids are the victims, well that&rsquo;s OK.  It is really disgusting.  The Bill and Melinda GAtes Foundation has something like $21,082,091,019 in its coffers by the way.  You&rsquo;d think with that kind of loot they could afford to send at least one White boy or girl to college.</p>

		<p>Mr. Washington of Detroit, the legal climate in this country is going AGAINST AA, and you know it.  Utah is the latest state to legislate against it, and it looks like the measure will pass there.<br>
Maybe whites should demand AA in college sports.</p>

		<p>If the left is in favor of racial discrimination favoring certain racial groups then how can they complain about others who favor racial discrimination in favor of their own chosen group?<br>
The lefties seem to want their cake and eat it too. You can&rsquo;t be against racial discrimination while being in favor of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Jay, this is already the situation in Southern California.</p>
<p>Our parks have been taken over by obnoxious, trash-strewing hispanics and the beaches are even worse  &mdash;  filthy, the water mired by high bacterial levels.  If you didn&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;d think you were in the pit of mexico and not in the US.</p>
<p>The trend I see around here where I live in S. California is Whites barricading their properties with 9-foot fences (some with cameras facing the street) and then fixing up their yards beautifully to entertain family and friends.</p>
<p>I often imagine this is how South Africa looked as well.</p>
<p>Some of these yards are awesome  &mdash;  salt-water or infinity swimming pools with mini water parks, landscaped yards rivaling the gardens at the Getty museum, elaborate fountains, beautiful, hand-crafted outdoor fireplaces, walls lined with mosaic tiles, koi ponds that drop down several tiers via waterfalls, high-end patio furniture, and lately, entire outdoor kitchens and enclosed spas with flat-screen TVs and surround-sound stereo systems.</p>
<p>And from Bobby:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I swear, I honestly wish, it would be otherwise, because I love this state, and because I have seen it at another time, when it was at its best, so I definetly have something to compare it to now. It&rsquo;s process of &#8216;becoming&rsquo; something else, is really quite scary&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I feel exactly the same way.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried explaining what California was like to my own children and they look at me as if I&rsquo;m from another planet, they can&rsquo;t imagine that California was as I describe it  &mdash;  an unbelievable paradise with low crime, uncrowded freeways, rows of orange trees, beautiful clean, White beaches, immaculate parks where kids were safe to play the entire day, where families frequently met for picnics, kiddie birthday parties, softball games and BBQs.</p>
<p>And yes, it takes a lot of money to live here if you&rsquo;re productive, the taxes alone will eat you alive  &mdash;  but many of us have paid off our homes and some of us have  pre-Prop 13 property tax bills, otherwise, we&rsquo;d be fleeing too.</p>

		<p>In response to Jay:</p>
<p>Affirmative Action policies disproportionately affect poor white people.  They&rsquo;re the ones unable to afford moving away to the burbs or sending their kids to private schools when the neighborhood begins to darken.</p>
<p>You sound like one of those elitists responsible for opening US borders to a continuous flood of third world immigration.  People espousing your views created affirmative action policies which are now being imposed on everyone else.  </p>
<p>You elitists see no problem with Affirmative Action as long as you&rsquo;re able to segregate yourselves from your own policies. </p>
<p>I want a to live in a racially homogeneous nation, instead of one like Brazil where there is only the very rich and very poor.    <br>

		<p>The suit says that a ban on preferential admissions violates equal protections?  Huh?  &#8220;Equal protection under the law&#8221; originally really meant &#8220;equal&#8221; rather than &#8220;special privileges&#8221;.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the University of California system is required by law, under its original charter to accept some percentage (I forget the number) of the top high school graduates in the state.  Refusing admission to ANY of those qualified who want to attend, for instance to allow in unqualified applicants because they happen to be of the politically-correct ethnicity violates both the university&rsquo;s charter and state law.</p>
<p>I have to admit that while I simply do not care how this suit turns out, part of me hopes it succeeds.  Any state as poorly-run as California deserves to go completely down the tubes.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m rather surprised that nobody commented upon my mentioning the audacity of Bill and Melinda Gates excluding ALL Caucasians from their scholarship fund.  To think that there are young White males serving in our armed forces today, puting their lives on line in Iraq, Afghanistan and probably Iran to protect this country from terrorism, that that the likes of this super rich couple can openly discriminate against them is really appalling to me, yet I don&rsquo;t see any outrage over it.  I expect that kind of attitude from Liberals and their Fellow-Travelers but on a site such as this I thought it would strike a chord with most people.  Can any of you imagine the outrage if these two Ultra-Liberals, Bill and Melinda, excluded Blacks and these other protected classes of minorities from their largesse, what a commotion it would bring about on all TV talk shows, the New York Times Op-Ed pages, etc.  Don&rsquo;t put your faith in Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, or any of these other neoconservatives.  Write your Congressmen or Senators and put the question to them.  See what their answer will be.  </p>
