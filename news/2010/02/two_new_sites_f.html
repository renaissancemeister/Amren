<h1>Two New Sites for African-American Heritage Trail</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gwyn McAllister, Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard Times, February 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In February, Black History Month, the African-American Heritage Trail will dedicate two new sites on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. Next Tuesday, Feb. 9, long-time M.V. Regional High School (MVRHS) teacher Quinton Bannister will be honored with a plaque at the entrance of the high school. On Thursday, Feb. 18, students involved with the Heritage Trail will unveil a second plaque that will be located on the outside wall of the building housing Sweet E&rsquo;s Cupcakes in Vineyard Haven. The historic building was the site of the first African-American-owned business on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and the plaque will honor barber/businessman William Hammond, popularly known as Barber Hammond.</p>
<p>The first of the honorees, Quinton Bannister, was the first African-American on the MVRHS faculty. He has been teaching at the high school for 32 years and will retire after this school year. Q.B., as he is known among staff and students, teaches history and law. Mr. Bannister moved to the Island from Washington, D.C., when he was 16 years old and attended the high school here. He started teaching history to students in the vocational program, while serving as a Vineyard Haven policeman in the summers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s been a very welcoming teacher to many kids who wouldn&rsquo;t have found a welcome anywhere else,&#8221; said Elaine Cawley-Weintraub, co-founder of the Heritage Trail and chairman of the history department. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s been important for many kids of color over the years to have him as a role model. For kids who haven&rsquo;t find congruence, he&rsquo;s been a very valuable figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Weintraub refers to the speech made by Mr. Small at the recent NAACP brunch in which he spoke about the efforts of African-American trailblazers and the unique stresses that they faced. Ms. Weintraub said, &#8220;I think 32 years ago I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked to be the first African-American on the faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the second dedication, the plaque to be placed on an outside wall of the building at 18 Main Street, reads &#8220;Barber Hammond  &mdash;  an African American entrepreneur who bought property and opened his barber shop in 1880 on this site.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Weintraub conceived the idea of the African-American History Trail in the early 90s when she was assigned a group of young children who were at risk for academic failure. She sought a way to engage the minority kids. &#8220;A lot of my teaching was around storytelling and role-playing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At one point I realized that these kids needed their own history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Weintraub, a native of Ireland and a self-described history fanatic, began researching the Island&rsquo;s African-American heritage. In her quest, she came upon a number of invaluable sources, including Carrie Tankard. As it turned out, Ms. Tankard had long made it her mission to introduce black history into Island schools, and so the two women joined forces to research, present, and promote the Island&rsquo;s African-American heritage. They co-founded the Trail in 1997.</p>
<p>That year the first site was dedicated: the Shearer Cottage in Oak Bluffs. In 2008 they added the most recent site, the Dorothy West house. The two 2010 additions will bring the total number of Trail sites to 25.</p>
<p>The Heritage Trail has become part of the sophomore class history curriculum. Students study the people and events celebrated by the Trail and are assigned a relevant research project. Each year the kids take the tour of the Trail and finish the day with a soul food lunch. Many of the students are involved in research and maintenance and participate in the dedications. Mr. Small is the student member of the Heritage Trail board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ms. Weintraub stresses that the point of the project is to memorialize those who have made a difference, including the unsung heroes, and not just the lauded individuals of the black community.</p>

<p>Wow, now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a major historical site if ever there was one.  Right up there with Bunker Hill and Plymouth Rock.  Who could possibly visit such a shrine and remain unmoved by Black History Month?<br>

		<p>To be fair, though the accomplishments aren&rsquo;t huge I don&rsquo;t mind hearing about this kind of stuff during Black History Month. There was the occasional black business owner, just like there were a lot of black cowboys and, during WWII, an all-black unit of real crackerjack fighter pilots.</p>
<p>They tend to get  &mdash;  literally  &mdash;  painted out of history, like one of those idealized Western paintings Ronald Reagan favored for the Oval Office. To me, Black History Month is really just a reminder that blacks were around too, doing most of the same things whites did and once in awhile even making a contribution to things&hellip; even if the majority of them haven&rsquo;t done much lately!</p>

<p>Quagmyer, from one General to another, I will be fine with the idea of a Black History Month once we Whites have a month dedicated to celebrating our manifold accomplishments (don&rsquo;t hold your breath).  As if we need more reminders flying in our face that Blacks were, are, and in the future will still be around??? Are you serious?  Making a contribution to things?? If by that you mean rape, murder, butchering the English language, epidemic obesity, and draining the economy then I see your point..I guess.</p>

<p>This is true, as there was also a particularly effective all black tank unit in Patton&rsquo;s army. HOWEVER!! the blacks of modern, hip-hop, gangsta, thug culture are a far less civil or civilized sort of people than the older generations (WWII)of black people. Earlier generations did not (to my knowledge) have such a demanding entitlement mentality.</p>

<p>Actually they get painted and often embellished into our history because they basically have very little history and very few accomplishments.  Their history consists mostly of beating us over the head that they were slaves then freed during the Civil War.  Decades later along comes MLK reading ripped off speeches<br>
and Rosa Parks the bus sitter then it&rsquo;s free at last.  Then came Obama, America&rsquo;s first quota President.  Can you imagine a building dedicated to the first (insert any race) to own a business in a city?  It screams pathetic and draws attention to the fact that it&rsquo;s unusual for blacks to own businesses.</p>

__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Sir, as with everything else, the contributions of the &#8220;crackerjack&#8221; black fighter group were overblown to say the least. For example, you have to understand that by the time they saw action, 90% of the real top rate German fliers were already out of action and that was due to the combination of and first Whie American groups and RAF shooting most of them down. You have to understand that many times, German pilots that the blacks faced were only 19-20 yrs old with very little flying experience and lightly armed and short of fuel as well. It would have been very &#8220;interesting&#8221; to see the black pilots face some of those German pilots whoes tactics are still studied by our air force.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn&rsquo;t the fault of the black pilots, because you face who the enemy puts up against you. The blacks weren&rsquo;t responsible for the logistical problems of the Germans.</p>

<p>Why would minority kids be at risk of failing? I thought race was a social construct, IQ tests were useless and there were no racial differences in intelligence! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed this many times in many places. SKIP at #5 comes closest to getting my point.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t think of a cowboy, for example, being black&hellip; except maybe the sheriff in &#8220;Blazing Saddles.&#8221; Yet many of them were. Whites don&rsquo;t need their own history month. Our society, left to its own devices, tends to presume that everybody who ever did anything worthwhile was white. I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the Tuskegee Airmen or the Buffalo Soldiers until hearing about them during Black History Month.</p>
<p>If today&rsquo;s blacks have any sort of legitimate grievance, it would be that for a very long time  &mdash;  though certainly not now  &mdash;  they WERE pretty much &#8220;painted out of history.&#8221; Of course, that&rsquo;s WAAAY too deep and abstract a concept for the average pants-falling-off aspiring rap star to understand, but it&rsquo;s my take on things and I don&rsquo;t begrudge them their own history month.</p>

<p>Carrie,<br>
There are two possibilities. First, it may be her married name or Second it could be her &#8220;maiden&#8221; name.  One of the Lord Mayors of Dublin, Briscoe, was Jewish.</p>

<p>In 1975 Parade magazine did an interview with several of these Buffalo pilots about their war time experiences.  The point that made the biggest impression on me was their lighthearted glee in retelling how they were used to shoot up the survivors of the Dresden massacre along the banks of the Elbe.  It went on for days&hellip;</p>
<p>Now of course it was white British and white American pilots who did the most damage but this black crackerjack really relished in the fact that he got to kill some of the escapees.</p>
