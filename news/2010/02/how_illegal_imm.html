<h1>How Illegal Immigration Hurts Black America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cord Jefferson, The Root, February 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the most part, the workplace crackdowns themselves are unremarkable  &mdash;  gaudy, ad hoc things that mitigate America&rsquo;s immigration problem the way a water balloon might a forest fire. Increasingly however, their immediate aftermaths  &mdash;  in which dozens of eager African-American job applicants line up to fill vacancies  &mdash;  call into question a familiar refrain from the nation&rsquo;s more vocal immigration proponents: Illegal immigrants do work American citizens won&rsquo;t. Even former Mexican President Vicente Fox fell victim to the hype, infamously declaring in 2006 that Mexican immigrants perform the jobs that &#8220;not even blacks want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Four years later, with national unemployment hovering around 10 percent and black male unemployment at a staggering 17.6 percent, it seems even less likely that immigrants are filling only those jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t deign to do. {snip}</p>
<p>Spriggs [Delonta Spriggs, a 24-year-old black man] has a difficult road ahead. In this recessed United States, competition for all work is dog-eat-dog. But that holds especially true for low-skilled jobs, jobs for which high school dropouts (like Spriggs) and reformed criminals (also like Spriggs) must now vie against nearly 12 million illegal immigrants, 80 percent of whom are from Latin America. What&rsquo;s more, it seems that, in many cases, the immigrants are winning. From 2007 to 2008, though Latino immigrants reported significant job losses, black unemployment, the worst in the nation, remained 3.5 points higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe there are any jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t take, and that includes agricultural jobs,&#8221; says Carol Swain, professor of law at Vanderbilt University and author of Debating Immigration. &#8220;[Illegal immigration] hurts low-skilled, low-wage workers of all races, but blacks are harmed the most because they&rsquo;re disproportionately low-skilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite President Fox&rsquo;s assertion, of the Pew Hispanic Center&rsquo;s top six occupational sectors for undocumented immigrants (farming, maintenance, construction, food service, production and material moving), all six employed hundreds of thousands of blacks in 2008. That year, almost 15 percent of meat-processing workers were black, as were more than 18 percent of janitors. And although blacks on the whole aren&rsquo;t involved in agriculture at anywhere near the rates of illegal immigrants  &mdash;  a quarter of whom work in farming  &mdash;  about 14 percent of fruit and vegetable sorters are African-American.</p>
<p>For their efforts, African Americans were paid a median household income of $32,000 in 2007. In the same year, the median household income for illegal immigrants was $37,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Besides competing for work while simultaneously attempting to avoid drastically deflated paychecks and benefits, unemployed African- American job seekers must also frequently combat racial discrimination. In a 2006 research paper called &#8220;Discrimination in Low-Wage Labor Markets,&#8221; a team of Princeton sociologists discovered that, all else being equal, black applicants to low-wage jobs were 10 percent less likely than Latinos to receive positive responses from potential employers. Furthermore, employers were twice as likely to prefer white applicants to equally qualified blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be blunt, a lot of employers would rather not deal with black American workers if they have the option of hiring a docile Hispanic immigrant instead,&#8221; says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. {snip} &#8220;And frankly, a lot of bosses are thinking, &#8216;I don&rsquo;t want to deal with a young black male.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I have two theories why employers might not want to hire young black men, one of them taboo.</p>
<p>Mundane theory:  Blacks want too much money, benefits and worker&rsquo;s rights, because they are familiar enough with the American standard of living, and they expect much the same.</p>
<p>Taboo theory:  Attitude and laziness.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re applying for a job where you want too much and want to do too little, compared to an illegal alien that will work hard for peanuts and not complain, of course you&rsquo;re not going to get the job.  And if you keep on voting for the Democrats or even the Republocrats, you&rsquo;ll keep on getting amnesty and open borders.  And if you don&rsquo;t handle your own mess, it&rsquo;s going to make things worse for you.</p>

		<p>This is true and frankly it is a downside of stopping immigration.  However, stopping immigration is what has to be done if America as we know it is to survive.  </p>
<p>Stopping immigration will benefit to blacks, and some of them will even realize it and take advantage.  But, in the event that white America asserts itself and ends third world immigration, white people are also going to have to get used to the reality of angrier, less reliable, less productive unskilled laborers.  </p>

		<p>California hospitals have pretty much ethnically cleansed the foul mouthed black men who used to do the janitor and central supply work.</p>
<p>Good thing too!! Every word out of their mouths was MF.  Shouted of course loudly enough to be heard a block away.  I remember waiting for a shuttle bus to the parking lot at change of shift about 3/15 pm.  Most of the others waiting were black male food and housekeeping workers.  MF MF was all I heard.</p>
<p>Hispanic men do not curse all day long at work as black men do.  And they speak in normal tones.  And they don&rsquo;t yak all day at work.  They speak only when necessary and for normal conversation.</p>
<p>Bring on the Hispanics, if only to get the MF word out of the workplace, and some work done.</p>

		<p>As a small businessman for the past thirty years, I can attest that most employers would prefer Hispanic or white workers to black, based on simple experience.</p>
<p>Blacks are, as a group, less reliable, less productive, more prone to steal, have drug problems, and are generally more problematic in almost every way than whites or Hispanics.  Obviously, these observations are not applicable in all cases, but as broad generalizations they&rsquo;re absolutely true.  And this dismal fact is known to everybody who&rsquo;s worked with them,  supervised them, and simply observed them.</p>

		<p>I hate to dismay Cord Jefferson but his man Obama the Great is, like nearly all Democrats, a big fan of illegal immigration and keen to give 20 million illegal immigrants amnesty.  This will keep wages low, benefits nonexistent, and will indeed keep unemployment rates among American blacks very high.  Liberals are all in favor of this.<br>

		<p> If black leaders really cared about their own people, they would be standing fast against illegal immigration. Instead, they work tirelessly for the economic dispossession of not only white people but their own people as well. </p>

<p>Sixty years ago, before the advent of the modern welfare state (LBJ&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221;), blacks did.  The availability of tax-funded government programs to insulate them from the consequences of their own poor decisions has encouraged sloth.</p>

		<p>Sure these hispanics are docile now but what about their offspring and so on. If they get amnesty and as their numbers grow, they&rsquo;ll become far more assertive and want more, money, benefits and everything else. Of course I can still see very much why employers prefer to hire hispanics. Of course if there are any shotages on unskilled work, do like they do in Saudi Arabia,  where 20% of the total workforce is foreign. In Saudi Arabia, these workers are legal, contract workers. They have, say a 5 year contract, then they must leave. No pathway to citizenship or anything like that. They must leave. We  could do the same. Instead of having these people come here permanantly, they could work for 5 years, make money but then must go home. Thus, they wouldn&rsquo;t be here permanantly having kids, changing the demographics, demanding their own politicians to represent their interests and so forth.</p>

		<p>Hey Amren Readers</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow details extensively how immigration (ALL IMMIGRATION) hurts most of the American workers but most especially the African American. Check out his site at www.vdare.com </p>
<p>We really are doomed and no one should think for a minute that Palin, Obama, Hayworth, McCain or any other politician will help us. </p>
