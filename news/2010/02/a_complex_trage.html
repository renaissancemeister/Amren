<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frey [John Carlos Frey], a 46-year-old filmmaker, blames the U.S. government for their deaths. In all, some 6,000 people have died crossing the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California borders with Mexico since 1994, according to human-rights groups. About 500 more die every year.</p>
<p>In his new documentary film, &#8220;The 800 Mile Wall,&#8221; Frey says this tragedy is the foreseeable result of a policy that sealed off urban crossing routes, driving migrants into the desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t this qualify as an atrocity to you?&#8221; Frey asked, after we&rsquo;d walked to the center of the cemetery on a warm winter day last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On our long drive to El Centro, he had compared the migrant death toll to horrors that no one would dispute deserve that stark label: genocide in Rwanda, ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their deaths are systematic and they&rsquo;re the results of a policy,&#8221; he said of the border crossers. &#8220;And it&rsquo;s not just a few. It&rsquo;s thousands.&#8221; Some people, he said, think the death toll might be as high as 20,000.</p>

<p>Compare those stats to the statistical abstracts of the deaths of American citizens at the hands of those illegal aliens who were successful in their illegal southern border crossings over the same historical period and get back with us Mr. Frey.  </p>

		<p>John Carlos Frey is yet another marxist who exaggerates the circumstances he doesn&rsquo;t like to gargantuan proportions, and then compares it to a REAL tragedy like Rwanda.  This is the height of dishonest journalism/filmmaking.  He&rsquo;s right up there with Michael Moore.  The fact is, if the &#8220;death toll&#8221; was that high in crossing the border, the Mexicans and Central Americans wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it in droves every day and night.  They may be cheeky but they aren&rsquo;t dumb enough to get massacred, which is what Frey describes.  What garbage.  The Mexican drug cartels murder MANY more Mexicans than do the U.S. Border Patrol!</p>

		<p>I agree with John Carlos Frey.  We need to immediately stop people from attempting to illegally cross our borders.  It is a very dangerous activity, shich can lead to death.</p>
<p>One way to save perhaps thousands of Mexicans is to finish building the border fence, which will dramatically recuce the number of people crossing the border, and hence the number of Mexicans dying in the desert.  <br>

		<p>Seems to me that a death incurred while sneaking across the U.S./mexico border is an unfortunate result of an ILLEGAL act. If you play with fire, you might get burned&hellip; If you tease the dog, you might get bitten&hellip; If you play on the highway, you might get runover. Sometimes, when you gamble, you lose. To blame this on the U.S. is both assinine and enraging. What can WE do about it?! I&rsquo;m tired of talk! Anybody here have a real plan before we run out of time? </p>

<p>Anyway, I still have a hard time having sympathy for people who VOLUNTARILY break into our country and steal a job, along with, usually, someone&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>From the original article: &#8216;Frey told me he&rsquo;s going to take his film on a tour of the United States this year. &#8220;I think if Americans knew what was happening here, they would be compassionate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;m naive.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, sir, you ARE naive. We don&rsquo;t care about you.  Go home and/or stay home.  We don&rsquo;t want you.  </p>

<p>Right, they are a result of policy. The policy of the USA not enforcing it&rsquo;s employment laws and border. If there were no jobs for these Mexicans to come, no welfare and our borders were guarded, Mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to come to the USA and there would be no deaths.</p>

Yes, it&rsquo;s those evil racist GRINGOS that&rsquo;s the cause of this &#8220;tragedy&#8221;. No Carlos, it&rsquo;s the foreseeable result of MEXICAN policies that drives these &#8220;migrants&#8221; into the desert.We didn&rsquo;t ask them to come here, we don&rsquo;t want them here, the MEXICAN GOVERNMENT drove them to their deaths. This is another good reason to close the border. Close the border - no more &#8220;migrant&#8221; deaths in the desert. Now, wasn&rsquo;t that easy Carlos? </p>

		<p>I note that this piece doesn&rsquo;t classify deaths of illegal crossers by category, leaving one to assume that they were all gunned down by the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>My guess is that the overwhelming majority (perhaps nearly 100%) of said deaths were due to natural causes, such as injuries, drowning, exposure, dying of thirst, or snakebite, with the remainder being from assault and robbery by Mexican bandits, drug overdoses, or being killed by the Federales.</p>
<p>I suppose this character Frey&rsquo;s point is that if the US had no immigration enforcement at all, most of these deaths would have prevented, since the illegals could simply cross over leisurely by car or bus and disappear into the North American countryside at will.</p>

		<p>He smuggles in a fallacy when he says, &ldquo;Their deaths are systematic and they&rsquo;re the results of a policy,&rdquo; as if some &#8220;policy-maker,&#8221; with the stroke of a pen, causes these deaths. When some beast, with the stroke of a pen, effects countless deaths, we call that an atrocity. Not this, however.</p>
<p>The deaths mark failed efforts to break the law.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that a decision to rescind the policy  &mdash;  to erase what&rsquo;s left of the border  &mdash;  might reduce these deaths, just as a change of policy legalizing murder would reduce the prison population. Perhaps we should abandon the principle of sovereignty in order to preserve the lives of invading criminal morons.</p>

<p>No, Frey. It&rsquo;s not an atrocity.</p>
<p>Our government is under no obligation to coddle illegal aliens who violate our sovereignty by illegally crossing our borders. On the contrary, our government is obliged to protect Americans from invasion. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution states:</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, <i>and shall protect each of them against invasion;</i> and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>If someone had a bag full of gold, tossed it off a cliff and some idiot jumped after it, who is responsible for the idiot&rsquo;s death? The man with a bag full of gold or the idiot who jumped after it, knowing he would die? Of course the latter is responsible.</p>
<p>This analogy relates to the situation with illegal aliens dying at the border. They want the prospect of earning more money (the bag full of gold) but are willing to cross a dangerous border (jump off a cliff) in order to get to it. Clearly, they know the risks involved. They are ultimately responsible for the consequences of their own actions, not the U.S. government.</p>

<p>How about a documentary revealing why these people can&rsquo;t find work in their own narco-republic?</p>
<p>How about one showing the crime, corruption, gangs and overload these people put on the system?</p>
<p>And, how about one detailing how these migrants refuse to learn the language or assimilate and insist on remaking Mexico right here?</p>
<p>And, too, how about a documentary explaining the push to takeover the Southwest in an invasion of warm bodies until they control everything?</p>

		<p>I am wondering what jobs are ready for these illegals? Many of their number have already returned to their country of origin because they are unable to find work. A film like this will make no difference in changing immigration laws. Congress is afraid to do anything that will jeapordize their relection. Besides, Americans, regardless of their political views, have no love for illegals. They have no sympathy for any sort of amnesty, which any reform bill would have.</p>

		<p>I did a lot of travel to Latin America in the 1990&rsquo;s monitoring drug studies for the pharmaceutical industry. One of the nurses at one of my sites in Colombia was a nun. She made the observation that as long as the U.S. took in all the poor and the malcontents from Latin America, their own countries would never be able to solve their problems.   </p>

Ahem, how many people do you suppose die of heat stroke or heat-related complications in a nation as large as the USA? More than 500, that&rsquo;s for sure. From things like mowing their lawn, etc. People drown in their freaking bathtubs at a higher rate.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that these people lost their lives  &mdash;  illegal act or not.  All the more reason for the U.S. to seal up the border and amp up domestic enforcement immediately.  Amend the constitution to close the anchor baby loop hole and permit states to terminate free education for illegal minors.  It&rsquo;s clear that irresponsible border enforcement on the part of the U.S. is encouraging risky behavior among our less affluent neighbors.  Secure the border now in the interest of human safety.        </p>

<p>1. These figures cited are just so terribly exaggerated!! Way beyond what is the real figures.</p>
<p>2. And others have commented correctly also, that the numbers of AMERICANS KILLED DAILY BY ILLEGALS IS FAR greater than the numbers of those that die crossing the border ILLEGALLY!!</p>
<p>About a half dozen to a dozen AMERICANS die daily at the hands of an illegal, and have been dying in those numbers for years now.</p>
<p>Mr. Frey has it all backwards.</p>

		<p>Why should anyone feel sorry for illegal immigrants who die, attempting to sneak into our country? We did not invite them. Nor do we want them? Let their own countries care and support them.

		<p>I think we need some clairification for a few statments in this article.&#8221;Driving migrants into the desert.&#8221; No, driving ILLEGAL migrants into the desert to avoid being arrested for breaking a LAW that was put in place for the safety &amp; security of the citizens in the country their trying to sneak into. Should we feel bad if someone falls from a roof top they were on to try to break into the building? The building, having closed &amp; locked their doors after closing, drove the criminal to attempt to gain entry clandestinely. So the owners of the building need to make it easier for the criminal to break in, or &#8220;migrate&#8221; illegaly, for the criminals safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their deaths are systematic and they&rsquo;re the results of a policy.&#8221; Again no, Their deaths are a risk they take breaking a &#8220;policy&#8221; that we call a LAW, just as the building mentioned above has a policy of locking up after hours.</p>

		<p>Crossing a desert, without an adequate water supply, and without the survival skills that are needed to accomplish such a trip, is dangerous, risky, and potential deadly to anyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert, but I suppose we are not only talking about the risk of running out of water (and dehydration), but we&rsquo;re talking about the risk of a heatstroke; and the risk of being bitten by venomous snakes, etc, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like anyone is FORCING those people to go on such a journey! Those peole choose to take that kind of risk, to try their luck at entering the US illegally., going on foot through the desert.</p>
<p>Some pay a very hard price. But whose fault is that, really?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if someone got killed in an accident while driving drunk, and some liberal said it was the fault of the workers who had built the road on which the accident had occured.</p>
<p>Strange thinking!</p>

		<p>After enduring so many years of Reds dumping guilt on my head simply because I&rsquo;m a productive White man, I find myself almost wholly without a conscience when it comes to non-Whites.  I refuse to read any novels about the struggles or suffering of non-Whites, I watch no movies about non-Whites, and when an earthquake or hurricane levels some non-White city, I think about how it might affect Whites.  I&rsquo;m surprised to realize this about myself, but a car crash in Canada which a couple of decent White kids are killed troubles me much more than the 200,000 dead in Haiti.  I suppose that my attitude was inevitable once  I realized that if I were drawn and quartered by Blacks or Mexicans, the MSM would give more attention to some &#8220;racist&#8221; graffiti found in a toilet stall in Nebraska than to my gruesome death.  Indifference to the misfortunes of those who care nothing for me and my people is simply good mental hygiene.  </p>

		<p>@ Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>I understand what you mean. I have little or no compassion for Blacks and Latinos, I must say.</p>
<p>I guess some people might think I&rsquo;m mentally ill or something, but I believe that the races are now competing against each other.</p>
<p>It used to be clear that Whites rules the world, but other races could also prosper and enjoy freedoms. But now, the balance that existed is being upset, and it&rsquo;s like there is struggle going on. We&rsquo;ll have to see what new order, or new balance, is set.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was really moved by the news of the earthquake in Haiti, I must say.</p>
