<p>Immigration Reform Leaders Attack Obama&rsquo;s Call for Amnesty, Support Immigration Moratorium</p>
<p>February 1, 2010</p>
<p>Three of the most high profile leaders of the immigration reform movement  &mdash;  former US Treasurer Bay Buchanan as well as former Congressmen Virgil Goode and Tom Tancredo  &mdash;  release op-eds this week calling for a time out on legal immigration and a halt to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>They point out that President Obama&rsquo;s SOTU remarks subtly hint at an amnesty push in 2010, while paradoxically noting that creating jobs is his top priority, the leaders note that a moratorium is needed since American workers are hurting and burdened by double digit unemployment.</p>
<p>* Tom Tancredo</p>
<p>In a World Net Daily column [&#8220;<a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=123528" target="tancredo" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Ultimate jobs program: Immigration timeout</b></a>&#8221;], the former Congressman and presidential candidate notes that the best jobs program is an immediate immigration time out. Tancredo writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Every month our government lets in 75,000 permanent foreign workers via &#8220;green cards&#8221; and 50,000 temporary workers through numerous guest worker programs. That&rsquo;s 1.5 million new foreign workers each year. Then add all the illegal aliens flooding across our open borders. Every one of those new arrivals is competing with American citizens for jobs  &mdash;  and contrary to the propaganda of the open borders lobby, they are not taking only &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>When our economy was growing, these figures were easy to ignore, but with 25 million Americans out of work, it is insane to continue these policies. Yet, few members of Congress in either party are willing to discuss reducing legal immigration to safeguard American jobs.</p>
<p>A timeout on immigration will also make it easier for the legal immigrants already here to assimilate. And unlike Obama&rsquo;s jobs program, a moratorium will not cost a penny and will create new private sector jobs for Americans and legal immigrants already here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Tancredo represented Colorado&rsquo;s 6th Congressional District from 1999 until 2009 where he founded the 100+ member bipartisan Immigration Reform Caucus.  In 2008 he sought the Republican nomination for president.   He currently serves as chairman of the Rocky Mountain Foundation and co-chairman of TeamAmericaPac.</p>
<p>* Bay Buchanan,</p>
<p>In her Human Events column [&#8220;<b>Immigration Enforcement: A Populist Program to Create Jobs</b>&#8221;], the conservative pundit points out that the president&rsquo;s call for &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; is a not so subtle push for amnesty. She writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite claims that we are enforcing immigration laws and the economic downturn is causing illegal aliens to leave, there are still over 8 million illegal aliens in the workforce. </p>
<p>Rather than cracking down on illegal aliens and their employers Obama has reversed positive steps towards enforcement made in the last years of the Bush administration. </p>
<p>Now he says he supports Rep. Louis Guiterrez&rsquo;s (D-Ill.) misnamed Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America&rsquo;s Security and Prosperity Act of 2009 that will completely gut all enforcement against illegal immigration and give a blanket amnesty to illegal aliens.  The bill has over 90 Democratic co-sponsors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Buchanan is a conservative activist, author, and pundit. She served as US treasurer in the Reagan Administration and then as a senior adviser to Pat Buchanan, Tom Tancredo, and Mitt Romney. She is currently president of the American Cause and chairman of Team America Pac.</p>
<p>* Rep. Virgil Goode</p>
<p>The former Congressman takes aim at an amnesty bill currently making its way through Congress and advises the GOP not to cave in on this legislation:</p>
<p>&#8220;As we all know, &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221; and &#8220;Path for legalization&#8221; are nothing but code words for amnesty.  Under Gutierrez&rsquo;s bill, every single illegal alien in this country the day of the bill is signed will be eligible.  This gives foreigners a great incentive to come to this country illegally because they know they&rsquo;d soon be eligible for amnesty.  A recent Zogby found that 56% of Mexicans said themselves or people they knew would be more likely to enter America illegally if they knew an amnesty was coming. </p>
<p>To make matters worse, when proving they have jobs and were in the country before the amnesty passed, illegal aliens are allowed to use their stolen identities, fake green cards, and fraudulent social security numbers without fear of prosecution.</p>
<p>It guts successful enforcement measures, limits raids on illegal immigrants, prohibits use of troops on the border, and replaces the effective E-Verify system used to ensure that employers only hire legal American workers.</p>
<p>If Republicans want to defeat this bill, we need to stand united as a party against this atrocity.  Democrats know this is a loser with the voters, but in the past Democrats were always able to justify their stance on amnesty by pointing to pro-amnesty Republicans like George Bush and John McCain.  With Democrats firmly in control of Congress, they just need a few Republicans to give it the air of bipartisanship and to give cover to vulnerable Democrats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virgil Goode represented Virginia&rsquo;s 5th Congressional District from 1997 until 2009.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that some of our leaders have their heads on straight regarding immigration reform.</p>
<p>Having open borders in today&rsquo;s bad economy with soaring unemployment is illogical. Amnesty for 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 illegal aliens is just plain insanity, especially because of the current economic climate.</p>
<p>A moratorium on all legal immigration is the best solution for our economy.</p>

		<p>  I think most Americans don&rsquo;t like illegal immigration but they don&rsquo;t want anything done to the aliens because they may feel sorry for them. How else can you possibly explain Sen Dick Durbin&rsquo;s reelection by a landslide in Illinois, a state that is overrun with  illegals. The people know Durbin is pro illegal alien, yet they vote for him. Go figure. These Americans&rsquo; pity will fast lead us from a first rate country to another Latin American banana republic.</p>

		<p>My state has been BANKRUPTED by illegal aliens - all the LEGAL residents are against amnesty.  It&rsquo;s only the people who came here illegally that are for it.  We want LEGAL immigration - and we want ILLEGAL immigrants sent home, no spit, no shinola.</p>

		<p>The silent invasion and overthrow of our country by millions of foreigners has been going on for years, aided and abetted by our own government. Our leaders forgot the virtues of honor, patriotism and loyalty to one&rsquo;s nation. They began to think on a global scale that sees no boundries or borders. Others see the influx of poorly educated masses as clay that can be molded to forever be subservient. The years have flown and now our nation is one of unassimilated throngs, a babble of language and cultures diametrically opposed to our own, and a welfare state existing for the upkeep of those who drain the American taxpayer dry. We protest, but our voices are ignored. We are soon to become a minority in our own country. We are often fearful of our own lives as many of the invaders are predators. We are forced to pay for their babies, their education and their incarceration when they finally are caught. We must compete for jobs and were told by the man who was elected to run this country that &#8220;don&rsquo;t worry about the Hispanics learning English, just make sure your chlldren speak Spanish.&#8221; Is that the height of arrogance? In our country, we must oblige the invader by speaking his language. Until the borders are sealed and every last illegal alien is sent home, our county will not prosper nor will we live in peace and security. Every politician who is a traitor to his country needs to be voted out of office.</p>

		<p>This is it. The battle over this issue is the most important fight among many fronts. It is Obama&rsquo;s only real chance to get relected and maybe even his crown if he can bus enough new voters in. If the Republicans fight this and lose the nation may be lost as they will cease to exist as a party. On the bright side they are not Muslims so we are still looking better than Europe.</p>

		<p>It is easy to understand why the people of Illinois keep electing senators such as Richard Durban.  The Republican Party has just about given up running anyone against him, and when it does it is just another &#8216;Democrat&rsquo; Lite.  Congressmen Mark Kirk (R-IL) is running in today&rsquo;s Republican primary election for the senate seat vacated by President Obama and now held by a Black nominated by our ex-governor &#8220;Blago&#8221; who may end up in federal prison for trying to sell Obama&rsquo;s senate seat in the beginning.  I think most of the zombies heading to the polls today will vote according to their party lines.  Chicago still has a huge patronage army under the control of Mayor Richard M. Daley.  These people will be working very hard to get out the vote and the Republicans just don&rsquo;t have an army like it.  Anyway, the Northside of Chicago along the Lakefront has always been a bastion of liberalism.  They don&rsquo;t vote for anyone to the right of Vladimir Lenin.  Don&rsquo;t expect this Mark Kirk to talk about legal or illegal immigration nor affirmative action programs.  He is also for &#8220;sensible gun laws which to him means banning them from ordinary citizens.  Most of the subject matter talked about and discussed on this website cannot be discussed in public or you risk being called a racist.  One must toe the party line.  Liberals = good, Conservatives = bad.  Race traitors like Bill Gates = good.  Tom Tancredo = bad.  Affirmative Action = good.  Young white males = cannon fodder.</p>

		<p>10 Lakeview Senior:</p>
<p>I feel your pain.  I&rsquo;m a St. Louis native, so the state on the other side of the river has always interested me.  I had a job in Carbondale for just about all of last year, but got laid off just before Kwanzaa.  (Some Ujamaa, eh?)  I&rsquo;m back in St. Louis at the moment, but I had job interviews in the west Chicagoland suburbs and in Springfield last week, and for various personal reason, I&rsquo;m rooting for this job in Chicago to come through for me.  (But I&rsquo;ll be happy with anything in this climate).  </p>
<p>Also, today are the primaries in Illinois, so I&rsquo;m acutely paying attention today.</p>
<p>The main problem with Illinois politics can be found on your (and my) license plate at the moment.  Adolph Lenin idolatry permeates everything in IL, political and otherwise, so of course racial equality is going to be the order of all time.  One of the flaws of Patterson&rsquo;s First Axiom is that if it were true everywhere, because of Chicago&rsquo;s uber-arrogant black population and political figures, you ought to have white George Wallaces and Theodore Bilbos and Ross Barnetts streaming out of the woodwork, but there aren&rsquo;t   &mdash;   Chicago nor Illinois in general has produced anything remotely close to a racialist right winger of that sort.</p>
<p>Aside from that problem, the elites of both the Democrat and Republican Parties in the state are rooted in evil.  The old joke I&rsquo;ve heard that for any given statewide office, the Democrat nominee is chosen in a basement near the stockyards, while the Republican nominee is chosen in the locker room of a country club in DuPage County.  When you&rsquo;re rooted in nonsense, you do nonsensical things.  For instance, when the slaughterhouse crowd forced Jack Ryan (who was himself nothing to write home about) out of the Senate race in 2004 between himself and Barack Obama, the Stupid Party couldn&rsquo;t find it in itself to send up the 2nd place finisher in that primary, milk magnate Jim Oberweis.  No, they had to truck in that chocolate moron from Maryland, Alan Keyes, who proceeded to make a mule out of himself during what he laughably called a &#8220;campaign,&#8221; coming out for reparations for slavery, and so on.  Obama wound up winning the general election with 70% to Keyes&rsquo;s 27%, and, as it turns out in his two tries to fill Denny Hastert&rsquo;s old seat now held by a Democrat, Jim Oberweis isn&rsquo;t the best of campaigners, either.  But he would have finished within 50 points, for sure.  With a little better search, the IL GOP might have found someone to beat Obama, and that course of history would be much different today.</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re watching the news this morning you see that the voter turnout for the Democrat and Republican Primaries were very anemic to say the least.  I think Chicago had a voter turnout of 25% of eligible voters while the rest of Illinois showed about 26%.  I&rsquo;ve said this to my cronies many times that the citizens here shouldn&rsquo;t complain about the crooks we always seem to elect for high office.  When only 1/4 of eligible voters turn out to vote then you deserve what you get.  I don&rsquo;t know what the ansewr is except maybe people should be fined for not voting, and maybe that would wake them up.  People just don&rsquo;t value the right to vote.  I&rsquo;ve seen that in the union I belonged to during my working life.  Out of 1,200 members in the local, we couldn&rsquo;t get more than twenty (20) people to show up for a monthly union meeting.  Well,that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>I disagree.  The fewer the better.  The more people that turn out, the more people will vote that have no idea what they&rsquo;re doing, and will literally do things like go &#8220;eenie meenie miney moe&#8221; when choosing someone to vote for.  </p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you love to be the only person in Illinois who votes?</p>
<p>BTW, it looks like you&rsquo;ll (and maybe I) might have a halfway decent Republican winning this primary in Bill Brady, if he holds on to his lead over Kirk Dullard, who hearts Obama.  Brady supports CCW, among other good things.  Brady&rsquo;s cause will be helped by Pat Quinn holding onto his slim lead over Dan Hynes, b/c Quinn is far more beatable in November, mainly b/c of the pardon scandals.  I wouldn&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t cast a vote in the Senate election; Mark Kirk can go take a long walk off a short Lake Michigan pier AFAIC.</p>
