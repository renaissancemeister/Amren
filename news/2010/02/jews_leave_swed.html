			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Meo, London Telegraph, February 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When she first arrived in Sweden after her rescue from a Nazi concentration camp, Judith Popinski was treated with great kindness.</p>
<p>She raised a family in the city of Malmo, and for the next six decades lived happily in her adopted homeland  &mdash;  until last year.</p>
<p>In 2009, a chapel serving the city&rsquo;s 700-strong Jewish community was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused on their way home from prayer, and &#8220;Hitler&#8221; was mockingly chanted in the streets by masked men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought I would see this hatred again in my lifetime, not in Sweden anyway,&#8221; Mrs Popinski told The Sunday Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new hatred comes from Muslim immigrants. The Jewish people are afraid now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malmo&rsquo;s Jews, however, do not just point the finger at bigoted Muslims and their fellow racists in the country&rsquo;s Neo-Nazi fringe. They also accuse Ilmar Reepalu, the Left-wing mayor who has been in power for 15 years, of failing to protect them.</p>
<p>Mr Reepalu, who is blamed for lax policing, is at the centre of a growing controversy for saying that what the Jews perceive as naked anti-Semitism is in fact just a sad, but understandable consequence of Israeli policy in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While his views are far from unusual on the European liberal-left, which is often accused of a pro-Palestinian bias, his Jewish critics say they encourage young Muslim hotheads to abuse and harass them.</p>
<p>The future looks so bleak that by one estimate, around 30 Jewish families have already left for Stockholm, England or Israel, and more are preparing to go.</p>
<p>With its young people planning new lives elsewhere, the remaining Jewish households, many of whom are made up of Holocaust survivors and their descendants, fear they will soon be gone altogether. Mrs Popinski, an 86-year-old widow, said she has even encountered hostility when invited to talk about the Holocaust in schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslim schoolchildren often ignore me now when I talk about my experiences in the camps,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is because of what their parents tell them about Jews. The hatreds of the Middle East have come to Malmo. Schools in Muslim areas of the city simply won&rsquo;t invite Holocaust survivors to speak any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hate crimes, mainly directed against Jews, doubled last year with Malmo&rsquo;s police recording 79 incidents and admitting that far more probably went unreported. As of yet, no direct attacks on people have been recorded but many Jews believe it is only a matter of time in the current climate.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, while the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.</p>
<p>It is a far cry from the city Mrs Popinski arrived in 65 years ago, half-dead from starvation and typhus.</p>
<p>At Auschwitz she had been separated from her Polish family, all of whom were murdered. She escaped the gas chambers after being sent as a slave labourer. Then she was moved to a womens&rsquo; concentration camp, Ravensbrück, from where she was then evacuated in a release deal negotiated between the Swedish Red Cross and senior Nazis, who were by then trying to save their own lives.</p>
<p>After the war, just as liberal Sweden took in Jews who survived the Holocaust as a humanitarian act, it also took in new waves of refugees from tyranny and conflicts in the Middle East. Muslims are now estimated to make up about a fifth of Malmo&rsquo;s population of nearly 300,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new hatred from a group 40,000-strong is focused on a small group of Jews,&#8221; Mrs Popinski said, speaking in a sitting room filled with paintings and Persian carpets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some Swedish politicians are letting them do it, including the mayor. Of course the Muslims have more votes than the Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst incident was last year during Israel&rsquo;s brief war in Gaza, when a small demonstration in favour of Israel was attacked by a screaming mob of Arabs and Swedish leftists, who threw bottles and firecrackers as the police looked on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t seen hatred like that for decades,&#8221; Mrs Popinski said. &#8220;It reminded me of what I saw in my youth. Jews feel vulnerable here now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is becoming an embarrassment for the Social Democrats, the mayor&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>Their national leader Mona Sahlin  &mdash;  the woman who is likely to become the next prime minister after an election later this year  &mdash;  last week travelled to Malmo to meet Jewish leaders, which they took to be a sign that at last politicians are waking to their plight. After the meeting, the mayor, Mr Reepalu, also promised to meet them.</p>
<p>A former architect, he has been credited with revitalising Malmo from a half-derelict shipbuilding centre into a vibrant, prosperous city with successful IT and biotech sectors.</p>
<p>His city was  &mdash;  until recently at least  &mdash;  a shining multicultural success story, and has taken in proportionally more refugees than anywhere else in Sweden, a record of which it is proud.</p>
<p>Sweden has had a long record of offering a safe haven to Jews, the first of whom arrived from the east in the mid-nineteenth century. Today the Jewish population is about 18,000 nationally, with around 3000 in southern Sweden.</p>
<p>The mayor insisted to The Sunday Telegraph that he was opposed to anti-Semitism, but added: &#8220;I believe these are anti-Israel attacks, connected to the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Malmo to be cosmopolitan and safe for everybody and we have taken action. I have started a dialogue forum. There haven&rsquo;t been any attacks on Jewish people, and if Jews from the city want to move to Israel that is not a matter for Malmo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweden has had a long record of offering a safe haven to Jews, the first of whom arrived from the east in the mid-nineteenth century. Today the Jewish population is about 18,000 nationally, with around 3000 in southern Sweden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jews came to Sweden to get away from persecution, and now they find it is no longer a safe haven,&#8221; said Rabbi Shneur Kesselman, 31. &#8220;That is a horrible feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>One who has had enough is Marcus Eilenberg, a 32-year-old Malmo-born lawyer, who is moving to Israel in April with his young family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malmo has really changed in the past year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am optimistic by nature, but I have no faith in a future here for my children. There is definitely a threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It started during the Gaza war when Jewish demonstrators were attacked. It was a horrible feeling, being attacked in your own city. Just as bad was the realisation that we were not being protected by our own leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Eilenberg said he and his wife considered moving to Stockholm where Jews feel safer than in Malmo. &#8220;But we decided not to because in five years time I think it will be just as bad there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is happening all over Europe. I have cousins who are leaving their homes in Amsterdam and France for the same reason as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malmo&rsquo;s Jews are not the only ones to suffer hate crimes.</p>
<p>At the city&rsquo;s Islamic Centre, the director Bejzat Becirov pointed out a bullet hole in the window behind the main reception desk.</p>
<p>Mr Becirov, who arrived in 1962 from the former Yugoslavia, said that windows were regularly smashed, pig&rsquo;s heads had been left outside the mosque, and outbuildings burnt down  &mdash;  probably the acts of Neo-Nazis who have also baited Jews in the past.</p>
<p>He said that the harassment of Jews by some young Muslims was &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; to his community. Many of them are unemployed and confined to life on bleak estates where the Scandinavian dream of prosperity and equality seemed far away.</p>
<p>For many of Malmo&rsquo;s white Swedish population, meanwhile, the racial problems are bewildering after years of liberal immigration policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I first encountered race hatred when I was an au pair in England and I was shocked,&#8221; said Mrs Popinski&rsquo;s friend Ulla-Lena Cavling, 72, a retired teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought &#8216;this couldn&rsquo;t happen in Sweden&rsquo;. Now I know otherwise.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is the sort of thing we need to publicize more   &mdash;   the contrary interests of different minority groups.  As long as everyone who&rsquo;s not a non-Hispanic white male considers themselves part of a diversity coalition, they win the politics while claiming the privileges of a minority.</p>
<p>The fact that illegal immigration hurts black employment and neighborhood diversity creates dangers for women needs to be part of our dialogue.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate degradation? She can&rsquo;t go into schools and talk to the kids? If this is what upsets her either she&rsquo;s lived a very long life and had time to forgive and forget or the Holocaust was not as bad for her as one would image.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a European publication. For just as the race of the perpetrator is left out of crime news, Racial &#8216;tension&rsquo;s, when it&rsquo;s non-white on non-white, are written about as if it whites who are the perpetrators even when they are not. This is before the educators call for racial solidarity among non-whites and show us how this hate too is the fault of whites, because an overall atmosphere of &#8216;racism&rsquo; exists leading to this result. </p>

It&rsquo;s telling that there are incessant claims about Nazis (whites) and yet such claims never prompt the accusers to leave. Now we see the real threat emerge and the exodus begin.</p>

<p>Having one&rsquo;s family murdered is not something one will forgive and forget, would you? I would imagine the Holocaust was horrible for her, if it had been you in her shoes, you&rsquo;d agree. The degredation she speaks of is that now she fears for her safety again and can&rsquo;t even go into schools and have the freedom of speech to talk about what she wants.</p>

<p>Sure they are embarrassing, nobody likes bad PR, but the real reason the &#8220;yutes&#8221; riot is from the hatred of all non-Muslims they are taught, mostly by their own parents, not because they lack opportunity. Also, it&rsquo;s much better to paint your group as the oppressed victim, like blacks do, because you then don&rsquo;t have to clean up your act, and you can also claim large sums of $$$ to right the &#8220;injustices&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Jews are disproportionately influential, verbally adept, and generally have more political power and more say in the media - and they have generally been major backers of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps this experience will change their minds. Let us hope so, anyway. Be nice to have more Jews on our side of the political divide.</p>

Anyways nowadays Jewish people have more pull at least compared to muslims. Certainly shouldn&rsquo;t their concerns sway the government and the people that the threat of Islam is real. Liberals are stupid and insane.  </p>

		<p>Are Jewish organizations in Sweden pushing hard for continued non-white immigration just as Jewish groups do here in America? American Jewish groups fought for decades to change our immigration laws, succeeding in 1965, and are now pushing for an amnesty bill. It&rsquo;s very difficult to feel sorry for a group of people who&rsquo;ve worked hard to destroy the US, and are now becoming victims of their own policies. </p>

		<p>Swedes of the &rsquo;30s and &rsquo;40s were pretty openly racialist themselves, though, unlike the Germans, their race consciousness was inward-looking and nonaggressive.  <i>Those</i> Swedes nevertheless opened their doors to the 8,000 Danish Jews spirited across the Kattegat at great risk to everyone involved.  (This included Niels Bohr, though not Victor Borge, who&rsquo;d already left.)</p>
<p>Think about this.  <i>Racialist</i> Swedes of yesterday risked quite a lot to rescue and harbor Jews.  But today&rsquo;s <i>anti-racist</i> Swedes are themselves a threat to Jews.  More evidence that anti-racism is even worse than racism!</p>
<p>Jews were not the only refugees the Swedes took in.  30,000 Estonians fled the Red Army in 1944.  They included a ten-month-old named&hellip; Ilmar Reepalu.  The future mayor of Malmö!</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan is weasel-speak for multi-racial.</p>
<p>The leftist liberal is always an elitist. &#8216;Cosmopolitan&rsquo; in practice means he wants to destroy traditional volkish Swedish homogeneity. He wants to see it replaced with a class-based system, where multi-racial liberal elites united by common socialist ideology steer a forced mixed-race underclass. </p>

<p>Too late. Prepare for even more Muslim/3rd world immigration once Mona Sahlin becomes prime minister.</p>
<p>Swedes are weird, really weird people. There is absolutely no country in Europe whose citizens can be more brainwashed by leftist/liberal/marxist agenda.</p>
<p>It may sound harsh but an 3rd world enclave is emerging at the heart of Europe, right in Malmo, facing no resistance from emasculated Swedish men and hedonistic Swedish women.</p>

<p>Cry me a river. <br>
Were Swedish Jews concerned about Swedish people being victimized by Muslim immigrants and Swedish girls having to dye their hair black from fear of harassment by Muslim youths? Not that I remember&hellip;</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t it European Jews who were pushing for minorities and their rights at every occasion? When the European people complained about the  incompatibility of the immigrants and increase in crime, weren&rsquo;t that Jews, who immediately started rants about renewed nacist tendencies rising and the road to new Auschwitz opening? </p>
<p>Now, when the joys of diversity finally reached also the diversity fiercest proponents, they start complaining and do, what they condemned in goyim, i.e., &#8220;white flight&#8221;.</p>
<p>And about her freedom of speech - at least she is not formally forbidden by laws to speak her mind out, like those, who were persecuted under the law against holocaust denial.</p>

		<p>This shows how difficult the dream of &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; is to achieve. A truly multi-cultural society would have Christian and Jewish Swedes living peacefully alongside Muslim immigrants. The reality, at least in this instance, seems more challenging. </p>

		<p>Any country that welcomes foreign Muslims is asking for trouble.  Islam is an aggressive and prosyletizing ideology, intolerant of competing religions and views.  Its very existence is anathema to the ideals of western liberal democracies.</p>
<p>Muslims should be kept out of America and western Europe by any means necessary and those already in these areas kept under close surveillance and relentlessly prosecuted for any crimes or disturbances directed toward the populations at large.</p>

		<p>I am of Swedish decent and proud of it.  I keep in touch with happenings in my homeland. <br>
Ulf Nilsson is a Swedish critic of his people<br>
He reported recently that in schools the Muslim males among other things hit girls and call them names etc.  The educational staff is however afraid to take meaningful discipline for fear of being deemed racist.  In Swedish egalitarian and anti sexist society, if a blue eyed blond student would do this he would be dealt with decisively.  But the current swedes are so enamored with their superior egalitarian, anti racist cultural relative society that they are afraid to take action.  &#8220;Who are we to judge if the Muslim students behavior is wrong&#8221;  The Swedes feel so superior in their culture that they are afraid to defend it.<br>

		<p>Malmo is right across the bridge from Copenhagen where  &mdash;  following Danish policy  &mdash;  non-citizens have a very difficult time marrying someone from their homeland and bringing them to Denmark to live. The policy hits Somalis, Pakistanis, and Turks (most of them Kurds) especially hard, and many of these have resorted to living in Malmo where Swedish policy makes it easy to bring in foreign-born spouses.<br>
Swedish policy is insane  &mdash;  Sweden is a nation of Swedes, an ethnic group, and it now has 15% of the population foreign-born (for the US, it&rsquo;s about 10%). The collapse of the Swedish nation will provide lessons for the rest of us  &mdash;  keep watching.</p>

		<p>We want Malmo to be cosmopolitan&rdquo;, said the mayor.</p>
<p> &lsquo;Cosmopolitan&rsquo; in practice means he wants to destroy traditional volkish Swedish homogeneity. He wants to see it replaced with a class-based system, where [a] socialist ideology steers a forced mixed-race underclass. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Of course he wants it to be cosmopolitan!  He is an Estonian. Why should he be concerned about Swedish homogeneity? That&rsquo;s not in his interest. No more so than Sarkozy cares about French homogeneity.  Such national homogeneity would exclude them;  they are its enemy. Cosmopolitanism and diversity are their goal.</p>

		<p>Reply to Deniz at #16:</p>
<p>I agree completely. Swedes are a very WEIRD people. Not unkind but strange, even bizarre. For many generations they have let their society be completely run by socialist governments that have totally taken over their lives. Swedes are also amazingly naive about the world and issues like race. Don&rsquo;t forget, Sweden has been at peace since the days of Napoleon. The Swedes are, to put it delicately, extremely unwordly. I had a long conversation with a group of young (mid to late 20&rsquo;s) Swedes. I was amazed at their views on race and their naiviety. They saw no problem with millions of muslim and Africans moving to their country at all. I finally could only say to them &#8220;well it&rsquo;s your country, culture and your lives&#8221;. It&rsquo;s kind of like a national form of &#8220;battered wife syndrome&#8221;, where the female is always blaming herself for the violence and abuse. Amazing what a few generations of socialist propaganda can accomplish in destroying a peoples sense of themselves as a people.</p>

		<p>I was in Sweden last summer. Just sightseeing, I rode the subway out to the end of the line (where it was above ground). Coming back, I was the only white passenger aboard. There were some Chinese (or other Orientals), some Africans (probably Somalis in full native garb), and an Arab family. </p>
<p>The Arabs were nearest me and interesting to observe.  The husband, throughout the trip, yelled and barked at his wife, while she sat passively, took the abuse, and did not answer him back. In turn, she scolded and yelled at her two children in the same manner. And the little boy yelled at and hit the little girl, who did not hit back.   <br>
The Arab pecking order!   </p>
<p>This is what Sweden considers &#8220;enrichment&#8221;.  Good grief!  What a kettle of fish they&rsquo;ve bought.  They had a beautifully functioning, clean, safe, orderly society   &mdash;   plus beautiful people -  but their politicians didn&rsquo;t have the sense to leave well enough alone.  They had to go and &#8220;fix&#8221; what wasn&rsquo;t broken!</p>

		<p>From the article..</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muslim schoolchildren often ignore me now when I talk about my experiences in the camps,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is because of what their parents tell them about Jews. The hatreds of the Middle East have come to Malmo. Schools in Muslim areas of the city simply won&rsquo;t invite Holocaust survivors to speak any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe they are getting weary of hearing about the camps 70 years after the fact? How about all the other holocausts throughout history? Such as what the Bolsheviks did to the Europeans?</p>
<p>More from the article</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate crimes, mainly directed against Jews, doubled last year with Malmo&rsquo;s police recording 79 incidents and admitting that far more probably went unreported. As of yet, no direct attacks on people have been recorded but many Jews believe it is only a matter of time in the current climate&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
I will wager that most of those hate crimes are against the SWEDISH population and we have all read about the rapes and other crimes of Swedish girls by the Africans and Muslims in Sweden.</p>

<p>Christians go where the crowd goes. In early America, most Christians agreed with the racialist views held by the majority of society. When the radical Jewish groups lobbied successfully to change America&rsquo;s immigration policies, the change in demographics resulted in Christians changing their views to appeal to the new demographic. This is why they are altering their positions on homosexuality. </p>
<p>Christians support multiculturalism because they are very evangelistic and hope to win converts. Radical Jews support multiculturalism because they believe they are safer in a multicultural society. The difference between  radical Jews and Christians is that radical Jews will seek to change an existing order, while most Christians will simply follow that change - any change. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s insane.  It is just a different strategy in trying to stop prostitution, based on the reality that men initiate sex, so the man is more at fault when there is an illegal act of prostitution.  Your misogyny aside.</p>

&#8220;The real problem with Sweden is that it is run by women.<br>
It&rsquo;s probably the only nation on earth run by women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe so. Certainly, Sweden has not had good results with female rule. Queen Christina (now much hyped by feminists) was a disaster who was sent into voluntary exile in Italy.</p>
<p>Sweden even has imposed a constitutional reform governing inheritance of the throne, which formerly (and everywhere worldwide) favored male heirs over females, allowing the eldest daughter to inherit before the next son. Thus, the next monarch of Sweden will be  Princess (Victoria) rather than her brother Prince Karl Philip.</p>
<p>Incidentally (a very interesting point), the offical title of the monarch was always &#8220;King of the Swedes and Goths&#8221; (and sometimes also of the Wends and Vandals)up until 1973. Not King of Sweden. In that year, at the same time that Sweden consciously decided to proclaim itself a multicultural, multiracial country, this title was changed simply to &#8220;King of Sweden&#8221;.  Denmark made the same change in 1972 under Queen Margarethe.</p>
<p>This is significant because the monarch was no longer the ruler of any particular people, nation, or tribe, but simply the ruler of the territory and whatever people resided within it. It removed the concept of nationhood, folk, and kinship, replacing it with territory, and reduced Sweden to a Proposition Nation. The internationalists at work!  Immigration had hardly yet begun, but the Left knew what was coming and was paving the way.</p>

&#8220;Men initiate sex&#8221;&hellip;.. Normally so. But in the case of prostitution, prostitutes who are in &#8220;the business&#8221; can be quite aggressive and may be the ones who initiate the transaction.</p>

		<p>Voter,</p>
<p>I was just referring to the schadenfreude. The tone I perceived as, &#8220;all Jews everywhere promote diversity so they deserve to be harassed&#8221;. Many Jews did/do support diversity, as do many other people, but I think it is unfair to say &#8220;all&#8221;, and not particularly classy to take pleasure in other peoples pain, as the German language bravely invented a word for.  Yes, some Jewish people contributed to that anti-intellectual way of perceiving the world through education, the media, etc, but many fought against it, and contributed competing ideas. Personally, I am part Jewish/Scottish/Cherokee, and strongly against scapegoating of anyone, be they white, Jewish, or otherwise.</p>
