<h1>Landrieu in a Primary Landslide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Luke, WWL-TV (New Orleans), February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time since 1978, New Orleans will have a white mayor.  Shortly after the polls closed, Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, a two-time loser to capture City Hall, won the election in a run-away, burying the field early and grabbing a large percentage of votes across all racial lines.</p>
<p>It was Landrieu&rsquo;s father, Maurice &#8220;Moon&#8221; Landrieu, who was New Orleans last white mayor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Winning votes heavily across all segments of the city, analysts were able to call the race so early as Landrieu ran way in front among almost all demographics: Republicans, Democrats, women, men, white voters and black voters.</p>
<p>Rigamer projected that Landrieu would draw 62 percent of black voters and 69 percent of white voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Landrieu&rsquo;s victory was &#8220;a combination of buyer&rsquo;s remorse from four years ago (when he lost in a runoff to Mayor Ray Nagin) and feeling, a pendulum effect  &mdash;  he is the most unlike Ray Nagin,&#8221; said Clancy DuBos, WWL-TV political analyst, alluding to Nagin&rsquo;s abysmal approval rating, which is around 20 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The quick call rippled through the campaign headquarters of several candidates as one, John Georges, gave his concession speech less than an hour after the polls closed.</p>

		<p>I thought Nagin could run again, and that this was a matter of Landrieu beating him and others.  But Nagin was term-limited out.</p>
<p>BTW, other than the family business, why does someone who is one heartbeat away from being Governor want to be a city mayor?  Sis is already in the U.S. Senate, so I would think that he would wait his turn to become Governor, and the punch of a Landrieu as Governor and Senator would be far more powerful.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Chocolate City&#8221; is gonna get a bit of vanilla added. If he can control the corruption, the graft and the incompetence in the city agencies, he may be successful. Lets hope he learned something watching his father work in that office. </p>

<p>Obviously he&rsquo;s going to win because the word &#8216;democrat&rsquo; proceeds his name on the election paper. It&rsquo;s the only ticket that can win in most urban areas. &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; is only a requirement for white schmucks. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not get too hysterical about this. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Mitch is the brother of arch-Liberal Mary Landrieu, and they are both the offspring of race-traitor and black panderer &#8216;Moon&rsquo; Landrieu who had the dubious &#8220;honor&#8221; of being the LAST White mayor of New Orleans. If that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, the reason Daddy Landrieu got that distinction is because he basically handed New Orleans over to black rule, single-handedly. So, the word on the street is that Mitch will simply be another black mayor in &#8216;White-Face.&rsquo; In fact, unless Mitch has come into some sage wisdom from the netherworld and rejects ol&rsquo; Dad&rsquo;s legacy (which he hasn&rsquo;t, and won&rsquo;t), blacks have no worries of New Orleans becoming anything but the &#8216;Chocolate City&rsquo; Nagin envisioned.</p>

		<p>My theory was, once a major city elected its first black mayor, it would either <i>a)</i> never elect another black mayor, or <i>b)</i> never elect another white one.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surprising how few cities have fallen outside these extremes, e.g., Philadelphia.   New York, Chicago, LA  &mdash;   the three largest  &mdash;   are all <i>a</i>; Detroit, New Orleans and Washington, <i>b</i>.</p>
<p>I may have to recalibrate this, what with Gary and now New Orleans: cities will tire of Afromayoralty either a) immediately or b) only after about three decades under it.</p>
<p>I think the Patrick-Obama era will put Massachusetts and the United States solidly in the <i>a</i>-camp!</p>

<p>St. Louis is almost fits into the (a) category.  It elected its first black mayor, a &#8220;yo homey keepin it real&#8221; type, in 1993, thanks to some voter fraud.  He lasted one term, and was toppled by a high-yellow black man, ex Police Chief in St. Louis, married to a white woman, in 1997, and sans the voter fraud, the voter pattern in 1997 was the same as it was in 1993, so even though he was &#8220;black,&#8221; he was perceived to be white in an honorary sense.  He lasted one term, four years later, in 2001, the &#8220;keepin it real&#8221; black tried to make a comeback, and on top of that, the white Aldermanic Board President ran, so you had a real white liberal versus a real black, and the incumbent high yellow got squeezed out big time.  The white won, and is Mayor to this day, won his 3rd term last year.</p>

<p>Actually, even before this election both DC and New Orleans had been &#8220;whitening&#8221; their mayors.  Nagin, light-skinned, succeeded the darker Marc Morial, while Washington had a three-step lightening process   &mdash;   from Marion Barry to Anthony Williams to the current half black, half Italian Adrian Fenty, who enjoys greater support from DC whites than blacks.  </p>
<p>If current demographic trends continue (blacks moving out of DC), it wouldn&rsquo;t be a shock to also see a white DC mayor by the latter part of this decade.  </p>

<p>Wow Reg, it&rsquo;s funny you should say this.  I&rsquo;ve been telling everybody that I know that America will NEVER again elect a &#8220;black&#8221; President.  Shall NEVER again elect a &#8220;black&#8221; Senator.  I&rsquo;ve also added to this, America shall NEVER elect a &#8220;black&#8221; Governor.  Patterson is on the verge of resignation.  Obama is back-tracking.  Deval is one-and-done.  Need I say more?</p>

		<p>This election happened the day before the Super Bowl, which apparently was the most-watched tv program in US history with 106 million viewers. </p>
<p>Did anyone notice that during the breathless coverage of the Saints&rsquo; victory, with the inevitable black linebacker grunting clichés about suffering and rebirth, not once was it mentioned that this historic sporting even coincided with an equally historic political one, i.e. the mayor&rsquo;s race 24 hours earlier? </p>
<p>My Aunt was a relatively important real estate developer and restorer in the Garden District area of New Orleans. She told me about meeting with Mitch Landrieu back in the eighties: they were having coffee on Magazine Street, talking about what kind of cooperation she needed from the city to make progress with her neighborhood revitalization efforts. She said that Mitch Landrieu told her, in essence: &#8220;Instead of working to bring back these old properties, why aren&rsquo;t you working to help those poor black people in St. Thomas? [the housing projects]&#8221;.</p>
<p>To anyone interested, the St. Thomas Housing projects were torn down about 7 years ago. They were among the most notorious housing projects of the half dozen or so that contained tens of thousands of indigent blacks throughout New Orleans in the years before Katrina changed everything here. It is astonishing to see the sumptuous, hundred million dollar-plus &#8220;mixed-income housing&#8221; developments that have sprung up where St. Thomas once stood: now home to a 98% black clientele.  </p>

		<p>It seems like whites are only voting their own race, when they see blacks are doing it too. It is some kind of cool to vote minorities until minorities are growing and get power. </p>

		<p>#5, you are quite right!  I think electing a black president has awoke whites from their slumber.  MOre and more of us our being vocal, more accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; roll off our backs, and even more blacks know that having a black person in power is not as cozy and safe as having a white man in charge.</p>

		<p>One would have thought that the Landrieu name would have caused voters, white and black, to recoil in horror.</p>
<p>In any event, an election in New Orleans has about the same relevence to the rest of America as an election in Zimbabwe, Haiti, or the Congo.</p>

		<p>If Mitch Landrieu does get anything constructive done in New Orleans, Bantus will soon howl like a wolf gone mad. They&rsquo;ll be unable to stomach the fact that a whitey actually turned things around there, just like the white minority South African regime turned South Africa into the most prosperous country on the continent.</p>
<p>That was the real reason for the anti-apartheid protests around the world - not that the regime was repressive (as are virtually all African governments), but that it was successful due to the minority population showing up the Bantus on how to build a successful nation. </p>

		<p>New Orleans will continue to sink down in terms of jobs, the economy,sea level, and violent crime, and the most convenient target of the blame is always the mayor, who this time is white. So once again, Whitey is then the cause of all evil in that city.</p>

		<p>I live in S. California.  We often get news stories from Mexico and vice versa.  I well remember a hurricane that hit some towns on the Pacific coast of Mexico about 2 weeks after Katrina hit New Orleans back in 2005.</p>
<p>For several days as the hurricane roared northward the news followed what the Mexicans were doing to prepare.  First the tourists were evacuated from the coastal towns.  Contrast that with the New Orleans bar owners who ordered Nagin not to order evacuation until the Monday because they did not want to lose the weekend receipts.</p>
<p>Then Mexicans were evacuated from the towns in an orderly organized fashion.  There were many shots of Mexicans preparing their homes and businesses for the hurricane, nailing plywood over the windows, sandbags etc.  </p>
<p>What impressed me most was that the plywood was not purchased new nor brought in by some benevolent government agency.  The Mexicans had plywood ready stored on the patio,under the deck, in the garage from the last hurricane.  Results were; the hurricane hit, no one was killed, there was no looting and destruction was minimal.</p>
<p>Just 2 weeks after Katrina, what a contrast.</p>
