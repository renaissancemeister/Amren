	<p>Zogby Poll Finds Wide Support for Enforcement, Lower Numbers</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  While it is sometimes assumed that minorities, particularly Hispanics, favor increased immigration and legalization for illegal immigrants, a new Zogby survey finds that minority voters&rsquo; views are more complex. The poll of Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American likely voters finds some support for legalization. But overall each of these groups prefers enforcement and for illegal immigrants to return home. Moreover, significant majorities of all three groups think that the current level of immigration is too high. These views are in sharp contrast to the leaders of most ethnic advocacy organizations, who argue for increased immigration and legalization of illegal immigrants. The survey used neutral language, avoiding such terms as &#8220;amnesty,&#8221; &#8220;illegal alien,&#8221; or &#8220;undocumented.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poll is available online <a href="https://cis.org/Minority-Views-Immigration" target="views" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a> The findings:</p>
<p>In contrast to the leadership of many ethnic advocacy groups, most members of minority groups think immigration is too high.</p>
<p>* Hispanics: 56 percent said it is too high; 7 percent said too low; 14 percent just right.</p>
<p>* Asian-Americans: 57 percent said immigration is too high; 5 percent said too low; 18 percent just right.</p>
<p>* African-Americans: 68 percent said it is too high; 4 percent said too low; 14 percent just right.</p>
<p>Most members of minority groups do not feel that illegal immigration is caused by limits on legal immigration as many ethnic advocacy groups argue; instead, members feel it&rsquo;s due to a lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>* Hispanics: Just 20 percent said illegal immigration was caused by not letting in enough legal immigrants; 61 percent said inadequate enforcement.</p>
<p>* Asian-Americans: 19 percent said not enough legal immigration; 69 percent said inadequate enforcement.</p>
<p>* African-Americans: 16 percent said not enough legal immigration; 70 percent said inadequate enforcement.</p>
<p>Most members of minority groups feel that there are plenty of Americans available to fill unskilled jobs.</p>
<p>* Hispanics: 15 percent said legal immigration should be increased to fill unskilled jobs; 65 percent said there are plenty of Americans available to do unskilled jobs, employers just need to pay more.</p>
<p>* Asian-Americans: 19 percent said increase immigration; 65 percent said plenty of Americans are available.</p>
<p>* African-Americans: 6 percent said increase immigration; 81 percent said plenty of Americans are available.</p>
<p>When asked to choose between enforcement that would cause illegal immigrants in the country to go home or offering them a pathway to citizenship with conditions, most members of minority groups choose enforcement.</p>
<p>* Hispanics: 52 percent support enforcement to encourage illegals to go home; 34 percent support conditional legalization.</p>
<p>* Asian-Americans: 57 percent support enforcement; 29 percent support conditional legalization.</p>
<p>* African-Americans: 50 percent support enforcement; 30 percent support conditional legalization.</p>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<p>This survey of minority voters shows that when it comes to the issue of legalizing illegal immigrants, these voters disagree with the leadership of many ethnic advocacy groups. Most voters want the law enforced and illegal immigrants to return to their home countries. Overall they also feel that the current level of immigration is too high. The poll specifically asks voters to put aside the issue of legal status and focus only on the numbers. Even so, most think the level of immigration is too high and very few think it is too low. Not surprisingly, when it comes to allowing more unskilled workers into the country, most Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American voters feel there are plenty of Americans here to do such work; employers just need to pay more.</p>
<p>The overall findings of this poll show a significant divide between the perception that minority voters want legalization and increased legal immigration and the reality, which is that they want enforcement and less immigration. Like most Americans, minority voters are not anti-immigrant or anti-immigration per se. Moreover there is not unanimity on the immigration issue among or between groups. What the poll does show is that, like most Americans, Hispanic, Asian, and black voters want the law enforced and illegal immigrants to go home. Moreover, they think the overall level of immigration is too high. When some leaders of minority groups speak on immigration and argue for legalization, they are merely offering their own personal opinions, not necessarily those of voters in these communities.</p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>Zogby International was commissioned by the Center for Immigration Studies to conduct an online survey. A sampling of Zogby International&rsquo;s online panel, which is representative of the adult population of the United States, was invited to participate. Zogby maintains the panel and has used it for other surveys. Slight weights were added to region, party, age, race, religion, gender, and education to more accurately reflect the U.S. population. The survey included roughly 700 Hispanic, 400 African-American, and 400 Asian-American likely voters.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by Zogby from November 13 to 30, 2009. The margin of error for likely voters is +/- 0.5 percent. The margin of error for Hispanic likely voters is 3.7 percent; for African-Americans it is 4.7 percent; and for Asian-American voters it is 5.1 percent.<br>

<p>Can someone please explain to me why the Democrats do not represent their party&rsquo;s base regarding the immigration issue?</p>

		<p>#1, the Democratic Party is run by elites who don&rsquo;t represent the common people at all.  They&rsquo;re totally consumed with cocktail-party far-left issues like gay rights and abortion rights and don&rsquo;t give a hoot what the little people think or want.  They feel for those poor &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221;, but not for hard-working, everyday American blacks or Hispanics.  </p>

		<p>One of my best friends is of Mexican descent - her family came here legally a half-century ago - and she and her whole family are totally against illegal immigration.  They feel that since THEY did it legally, everyone else should too.  Of course I agree 100%!  We&rsquo;d all like nothing better than to have every illegal immigrant deported back to where they came from, and if they want to be here, go the legal route.</p>

		<p>This is a variation of the old conservative reality-avoiding game of &#8220;They&rsquo;re really conservative,  honest they are!&#8221; - usually said about blacks.   The ONLY thing that matters is who and what they VOTE for,  and both blacks and Hispanics consistently vote for far-left,  anti-white, racial-spoils candidates.  Part of the problem is that people are controlled by emotions, not rational thought,  and even though these minorities &#8220;know&#8221; that mass-immigration will kill the golden goose (after all, the ONLY reason they came to America is because whites live here and made it a successful society,  they didn&rsquo;t come for the air or the view) they will continue to support the genocidal left.   Their hatred, carefully fostered by the elite, will override rational thought.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that I can agree with two thirds of American blacks on <i>something</i>.  Carol Swaine is right, mass immigration is hurting employment prospects for black Americans.  But our elites won&rsquo;t listen to us on this issue.  Corporate America wants cheap labor, and the Hispanic lobbying organizations all want more immigration and amnesty for illegals, the quicker to create Atzlan.  Those are the only ones our politicians listen to.</p>

		<p>I just visited numbersusa.coms website. Why are they so White- phobic on that website.</p>
<p>Try deporting millions of hispanics. The &#8220;anti-immigration&#8221; hispanics will be out in the streets protesting the mass deportations. LA is foreign and spanish speaking. Miami is foreign and spanish speaking.</p>
<p>Why is numbersusa.com White-phobic? Follow the money.Follow the money.</p>

<p>Wow, what a sampling, huh? This is just another example of &#8220;polling&#8221;.. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy their propaganda that these 3 groups are in favor of sending anyone home that belongs to their own racial group, period!  They want MORE immigration, legal and illegal, as long as those are in their racial group. I saw just how many &#8220;American-Mexicans&#8221; supported all these illegal Mexicans when they were marching and burning our flag. Of course you can find a FEW here and there to get the poll numbers you want. ALL nonwhites want more of their own to come into our country and there isn&rsquo;t a poll that will tell me differently.</p>

		<p>This is a no brainer, that mestizos would want less imigration. They know the old sow only has so many teats. Thus the indigent free loaders would run out of freebies. As for the rest of us, well also a no brainer. The big zero&rsquo;s new tax law . = how much did you make? Send it in!

		<p>Immigration advocates WANT open borders.<br>
Liberals WANT open borders.<br>
Those profiting (business owners, corporations) WANT open borders.</p>
<p>The common Americans who have to foot the $100 BILLION a year cost of illegal immigration&hellip; those many, many of Americans who are only too aware of the real criminals among the criminal illegal aliens AND their grown anchor babies&hellip; the many, many Americans who have to see their lifestyle and experience the Mexican caused social problems first-hand&hellip; all are very much AGAINST open borders and very much FOR DEPORTATION! Any questions from anyone?</p>
<p>P.S. My comment on so much crime done by illegals and their anchor babies&hellip; any honest law enforcement official can attest to that one (off the record, of course). As can those in the administrative part of law enforcement. Those who review arrest and crime records, for example. California is an excellent example for you doubters.</p>
