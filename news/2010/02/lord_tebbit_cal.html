			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister, has called for a policy of zero immigration.</p>
<p>In a blog on The Daily Telegraph website, Lord Tebbit said: &#8220;These islands are our islands.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We live here and it is we, the people, who have the absolute right to decide who may, and who may not, come here and upon what conditions they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Admitting that his comments may hold him up to allegations of &#8220;racism and worse&#8221; he said immigration could nevertheless bring benefits.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8220;The characteristic that such immigrants have in common is at least an acceptance of our ways, and more often a sharing of the inheritance that has shaped our habits and culture here in this European offshore island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all immigation has been quite like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The population of Britain will hit 70 million by 2029, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>But last month a cross-party group of MPs and peers, including a former Commons Speaker and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded that the population be kept below that level or put harmony at risk.</p>
<p>Lord Tebbit concluded: &#8220;It seems to me that we must assert that we need to aim for a zero net immigration policy. We cannot achieve that while our frontiers are open to EU citizens, and although that is not too threatening at present, some of the prospective new member states would act like wide open doors to Third World migration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord Tebbit said Britain needed a &#8220;decent policy of giving sanctuary to true refugees&#8221; but, he added: &#8220;We must close the door to others and start serious work on deporting those here illegally, as well as reinstating proper border controls.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is much to be done  &mdash;  but the political class will do almost anything to avoid talking about it at the forthcoming election.&#8221;<br>

		<p>He still doesnt get it. Its about culture, not nationality, not <br>
genetics. And culture is almost genetic in its obduracy.<br>
After 400 years Black Culture in the USA is deeply akin to the emotions and rhythms and values of Africa. No matter what the technological advancements, or the values the host country..these genetic-cultural traits dont change. And because they dont change..they will never assimilate. 100 years from now Britain will still have terror bombings from Muslims  or rather, the white minority will exist in a terrorized dhimmi-servitude to the Islamic majority.</p>

		<p>The modern world has cultural indigestion. The traditional nations and regions of the world cannot maintain mental equilibrium with such excessive infusions of outsiders. Just because travel is made easy by technology, doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s all there is to identity change. Its a naive idea and the confusion is evident. Curbing immigration is simply a realization of human natures need for consistency. Some immigration is likely better than none, when the people are properly screened&hellip; as they do offer some spice in things like ideas and cuisine. But only a small number. Beyond this is cultural dissipation. In the real world..everything has limits. Natural limitations make things precious. Let the natives decide*.. respect is a two way street.</p>

		<p>Lord Tebbit said Britain needed a &ldquo;decent policy of giving sanctuary to true refugees&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why does Britain need such a policy?  On the contrary.  True refugees tend to come from nations that are true failures - and they tend to bring those failures with them.  It is not the job of Western nations to take in the excess people that third world nations produce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is too late for even a &#8220;zero immigration policy&#8221; to do much good.  At this point it&rsquo;s like locking the barn door after the horses have fled.  The only hope for Britain forcefully reduce the birthrate of non-white &#8220;Britons&#8221; while increasing the birthrate of white Britons.  Either that or orchestrate mass expulsions of the former.  Would this be brutal, inhumane and contrary to Human rights standards?  Of course - they should have thought of this before importing millions of aliens.</p>

		<p>Zero immigration is not enough all the non-White invaders already inside have got to leave. Unless that does not happen, our struggle goes on. </p>
<p>Lord Tebbit said Britain needed a &ldquo;decent policy of giving sanctuary to true refugees&rdquo;<br>
Yes I agree, but only for White people. People like those poor Rhodesians and South African Whites who cannot leave South Africa due to poverty. Not for people like Kurds, Somalis and Pathans.</p>

		<p>I must agree with the policy of giving sanctuary to true refugees.<br>
I would also insist that all countries abide by the UN convention on refugees, which are really quite simple, a country should allow  persecuted individuals from neighbouring countries to seek asylum. I can well see the day when Dutch freedom lovers hop accross the channel to claim sanctuary or even Swedes or French who don&rsquo;t like the burqa - that can only happen if labour gets thrown out. This has happened for hundreds of years, the Dutch escaping Spanish persecution, the French Hugenots followed by the royalist, and in this century many in Europe escaping the Nazis.<br>
But as Dutch, French and Danish escaped to neighbouring England,<br>
the Afghans should escape to neighbouring Pakistan, Iran or Russia. The Turkish Kurds can escape to Iraq and Iran where they have a very large population of their own. The fact that a refugee from the Congo, bordered by eight African counties all of which contain a large number of his own, crosses most of them and a dozen others to go to England shows that he is no longer a refugee. At lest 90% of all so called refugees are economic migrants, show them the door.</p>

		<p>The true nature of the American immigration experience today as opposed to the one of a hundred or even fifty years ago is mainly one of proximity.  When my grandfather and all those like him immigrated from Europe in the early 20th Century, they effectively cut their ties with the old country and had no choice but to embrance the new.  The old country and its familiar personal associations was then a hugely distant and expensive trip away, something not casually undertaken except by the very wealthy.  There was no international phone system, with its almost free access, with which to keep in touch with the old country and all one&rsquo;s relatives.  </p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s certainly true that many immigrants to the US a century ago settled into newly-formed ethnic communities, by and large their children did not, and within a generation the offspring were fully assimilated Americans.</p>
<p>Today our typical immigrant individual and family crosses the southern border of the US, leaving behind the ancestral home by a few hundred quickly traversed miles.  Contact with those left behind is continual and verbal via cellphone. Visits from those left behind are frequent, as are visits by the new immigrants to their erstwhile homes. There is no need to become assimilated.  Effectively the new immigrants have never left their old homes.</p>
<p>Their immigration is similar to that of a family which moves from New York to Pennsylvania, a change of scenery to be sure, but nothing more wrenching than that and with no assimilative adjustment required.</p>
<p>America now has tens of millions of total foreigners living in her, foreigners who have no intention, indeed, no impetus to assimilate.  Without immediate action to stop and then actively reverse this invasion our nation will be destroyed as surely as if by massive nuclear attack.</p>

		<p>Why do refugees always have to come to the english speaking countries of the world?  Why are Haitians being airlifted to Florida when the stable and prosperous dominican republic is right next door, and Mexico and Central America and Jamaica, etc&hellip;  Those places have hospitals and functioning societies.  Why not send African refugees to Iran or India or China?  Why can&rsquo;t the Hmong go to Burma or Syria or South Africa?  Why is it always we who have to host every person in the world who stubs their toe or who wants an Ipod?</p>

<p>The Dominican REpublic is stable and prosperous because the Dominican border guards shoot to kill any Haitian who comes over the border.  Dominicians have a long memory of the Haitian invasion and rape fest back around 1810.   Dominician employers have enough sense to not employ Haitians so as to keep the Dominician REpublic stable and prosperous and the crime rate low.</p>

		<p>The only people allowed into Britain for the purposes of permanent settlement should be white people of British descent. This, according to the BNP, is &#8220;homecoming not immigration&#8221; and therefore does not contradict the zero-immigration policy which my Party shares with Lord Tebbit. However, the BNP goes far beyond his Lordship in demanding that immigration be not just halted but reversed for only that will save Britain as a recognisable human society. Nor need the reversal be as difficult as many suppose - just limit benefits of every kind to British citizens only (having first revoked all citizenships granted since Labour came to power), then wander round the exit gates at any major airport and enjoy!</p>

<p>As I look back at history, I realize that Britain&rsquo;s problems with non-indigenous peoples began when Cromwell became Protector. All the other immigration problems Britain has faced since 1660, rest squarely on the shoulders of Cromwell&rsquo;s version of  &#8216;invite the world, invade the world&rsquo; strategy.</p>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s happy&hellip;. in hell.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;He still doesnt get it. Its about culture, not nationality, not genetics.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about all of those elements.  One cannot separate culture and nationality from race (genetics), remember.</p>
<p>Culture is unique to the race which gave birth to it.</p>
<p>Nationality arises from sub-races of people separating and thus evolving their own distinct languages, heritages, cultures and traditions on their independent territorial patches.<br>
