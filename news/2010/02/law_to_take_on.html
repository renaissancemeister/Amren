			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Gordon, The Age (Melbourne), February 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>LAWS to tackle racism on the internet are set to be beefed up.</p>
<p>Authorities warn they are often powerless to act against online content, which is responsible for almost one in five racial vilification complaints.</p>
<p>Attorney-General Robert McClelland has ordered the Australian Human Rights Commission to conduct a sweeping review of &#8220;arrangements for dealing with racist material on the internet&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;While freedom of expression is one of the most fundamental rights, this is not at the expense of the rights of people, while using the internet, to be treated with equality, dignity and respect,&#8221; Mr McClelland told The Sunday Age.</p>
<p>Mr McClelland said the government was exploring what action it could take on internet material that breaches the Federal Racial Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>Options include providing the commission with sharper teeth to order internet service providers to remove racist content, and changing the Racial Discrimination Act so it is easier to apply criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>Such changes, which are opposed by civil libertarians, could have a major impact on news websites that offer readers the opportunity to comment, and on internet service providers that currently work voluntarily with the Human Rights Commission to remove racist material.</p>
<p>At its most serious, online racism is dealt with under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which can punish those who urge people to harm other Australians because of their race.</p>
<p>But when there is no obvious intent to incite violence, the commission has only limited powers.</p>
<p>Race Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes said there were clearly &#8220;persistent pockets of racism in Australia&#8221; linked to attacks on Indian students and cyber racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no getting away from it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cyber racism is a result of that, as are the attacks on Indian students, and we need to address it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Premier John Brumby and Victoria Police have insisted there is no evidence that most attacks against Indian students in Melbourne are racially motivated. The stance has infuriated India, contributing to a damaging rift. Mr Innes said complaints about cyber racism made up 18 per cent of all racism complaints received by the commission.</p>
<p>He said the Racial Discrimination Act should be changed to allow prosecutions in serious cases of internet racism.</p>
<p>Currently, the commission can only resolve racial complaints through conciliation with internet service providers and social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a proliferation of apparently racist social networking groups such as SPEAK ENGLISH OR PISS OFF!!! (SEOPO), with almost 50,000 members, &#8220;F  &mdash;   Off We&rsquo;re Full&#8221; and &#8220;Mate speak English, you&rsquo;re in Australia now&#8221;.</p>
<p>But civil libertarians are concerned the changes could have unintended consequences, creating a divide and hardening racist attitudes in the community.</p>
<p>Liberty Victoria president Michael Pearce said legislating to police racism on the internet was difficult and the government would be better off putting resources into community education and improving social cohesion.<br>

<p>Balderdash. If a society doesn&rsquo;t believe in free speech for boors, then it doesn&rsquo;t believe in it at all, because everyone in this world is someone else&rsquo;s boor  &mdash;  even you, Mr. McClelland. </p>

<p>Attacks on Indian students? You mean these ones?</p>

		<p>Yep. Throw the races together in one nation and expect that nation to survive? Doesn&rsquo;t it tell these dang White governments that to have to FORCE compliance through hate laws and racial laws that it is not NATURAL for different races to live together or even want to live together??  And especially when those same governments changed the racial make up of immigration (on purpose) into WHITE countries only? What do they expect? Oh, I know for the WHITES to shut up and smile while having that knife shoved in their backs. </p>

		<p>What I find positively chilling is the matter-of-fact way this newswriter treats this whole issue of clamping down on some very fundamental human freedoms. This despite the fact that it has some very serious ramifications for the news industry. While the article mentions that the measures are opposed by civil libertarians, for example, it doesn&rsquo;t bother to quote any of them. Even though the word &#8220;racist&#8221; has a thousand varying definitions, the writer never bothers to put the word in quotes, apparently taking it as a given that everybody agrees on what the word means. The unconcerned tone of this article indicates that these are very scary times indeed for defenders of free speech. </p>

<p><br>
SAY HUH?????????????????????????<br>
Every minute of the day, even talking heads and politicians are entirely free to bash people who have white skin. Nobody can be bothered to notice.<br>
And, BTW, Mr McClelland you cannot have freedom, if you&rsquo;re worried about someone getting their panties in a bunch. You&rsquo;re taling out of both ends, but you got the wrong end to the microphone, idiot.<br>

		<p>The sad thing is that when some people start talking about &#8220;equality, dignity, and respect&#8221; people who they don&rsquo;t agree with have to expect &#8220;repression, hate, and harassment&#8221;.</p>
<p>The typical liberal zealot doesn&rsquo;t have the faintest idea that his selective tolerance is not what freedom of speech is about.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Freedom of expression is one of the most fundamental rights&#8221; that needs no qualification. Typical lefty saying they support something then immediately contradicting it in the second half of the sentence. Always we have to counteract the language of the left.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the only time Yahoo Buzz closes comments, when racist points are made. I have been here, and there with my racist amateur poetry, and prose on the internet (Google me). I was on Myspace, and the forums banned me twice; then they deleted my profile. Now, i am at Yahoo. No matter if your racism is reasonable, it will eventually have no outlet..? I commented recently on a article about Michelle Obama in England on Buzz. Regarding how they sure are a fulfillment of civil right, and about the tyranny of prohibiting discrimination, and preference in public, and they kept taking it down. Eventually they just closed the comments, due to others making certain commentary along those lines.</p>

		<p>  Thank God for the Internet. It is one of the few communication mediums not controlled by our elites. Naturally, they want to end our freedom of speech using the excuse of stopping &#8220;Cyber-racism&#8221;.<br>
Will the ACLU oppose this creeping censorship? So far, I haven&rsquo;t heard of a principled stand by the ACLU on either this issue or the repeated cancellations of the AR Conference. They appear more concerned about the rights of pornographers. </p>

<p>I like your use of verbal irony.</p>
<p>Of course, child porn, and the fear of it, are being used as the excuse for government-mandated ISP-level censorship.  But when it comes, it won&rsquo;t be child porn that&rsquo;s censored, it is sites like those you are reading now.  Child porn will continue to exist, because the media has exposed that most internet child porn is government-owned, for the purpose of catching those who look at child porn on the internet.  (Seems a little circular there, doesn&rsquo;t it?)</p>

Comment #17</p>
<p>Question Diversity: It sure does!</p>
<p>I also think the Fringe-Left is actually more tolerant towards pedophiles than towards White &#8220;racists.&#8221; As evidenced in the Netherlands (with a pro-pedophile political party), the legalization of Child Porn and pedophile sex are a result of the Leftward shift of the Overton Window-not in spite of it.</p>

I can identify with that, having just been in a hotel where access to Amren was denied because it was deemed &#8220;dangerous to minors&#8221;.  Well, I&rsquo;m no minor!   And I&rsquo;m sure Amren would not harm them children (nor would they be interested in it, this is not a kiddie site);  but this was used as the excuse to keep me from accessing Amren.  The ostensible excuse of protecting children is simply another way of silencing those views that The Establishment does not want to be heard.</p>
