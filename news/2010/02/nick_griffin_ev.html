<h1>Nick Griffin Events Cancelled Due to Threats of Violence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jordan Zammit, MSU Sons of Liberty, February 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For Immediate Release:<br>
February 15, 2010<br>
Jordan Zammit<br>
President and Founder,<br>
MSU Sons of Liberty<br>
MSUSonsOfLiberty@gmail.com</p>
<p>The newly-formed registered student organization at Michigan State University, the Sons of Liberty, cancelled its first public event. Nick Griffin, a democratically-elected member of the European Parliament and chairman of the British National Party, was scheduled to speak at MSU on February 18 regarding the fraud of man-made global warming. The event was cancelled because left-wing agitators caused other organizations to cancel their own events that featured Griffin, and it could not be justified for Griffin to fly to the U.S. to only speak at MSU and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>After a synopsis of Griffin&rsquo;s schedule was released to the media, left-wing agitators relentlessly threatened with violence and death the organizers of the events. This caused Taylor Somers, the leader of Kenyon College&rsquo;s conservative Robert A. Taft Society, to cancel his club&rsquo;s event out of concern for safety of his fellow students. It was confirmed that Griffin would not come to the U.S. after leftists successfully caused three hotels to rescind their offers to allow the biyearly American Renaissance conference from being hosted at their properties.</p>
<p>Griffin could not afford to spend time in the U.S. to only speak at MSU and at CPAC when he could otherwise spend his time campaigning for a seat in the U.K. Parliament. The Sons of Liberty does not fault him for canceling his trip to the U.S., and the student organization looks forward to hosting him  &mdash;  hopefully as M.P. Nick Griffin  &mdash;  when he next crosses the pond.</p>
<p>Jordan Zammit, the founder and president of the Sons of Liberty, said, &#8220;The Left does a very good job of advocating free speech for themselves while denying it to others. I am very proud to say that the Sons of Liberty, in its inaugural run, did what it was meant to do and that is ensure that all points of view are presented and that the first amendment is upheld for ALL people to the fullest. If the other speaking venues would not have canceled and his speaking tour called off, I can assure you Mr. Griffin would have been here Thursday afternoon as scheduled, intimidation or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BNP-U.S. liaison is planning to file a complaint with the United States Department of Justice because elements of the Left conspired to deprive American citizens of their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble and participate in political discourse, which is in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241. That federal law states that &#8220;If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having exercised the same; they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zammit also said, &#8220;Although Griffin was targeted in Sweden with assassination by leftists when they tried to bomb the train he was riding on in 2006, members of the Sons of Liberty were not  &mdash;  and are not  &mdash;  afraid of the red menace. My organization is made up of common sense young men and women, both considerably liberal and conservative, of numerous races and creeds, whom all believe that the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution are something sacred, and that no matter who is speaking, he or she has every right to, and whether you agree with them or not, it can never hurt to listen.&#8221;<br>

I have maintained for some time that the courts could be of considerable value to our cause. Both civil and criminal. Hopefully the &#8220;BNP-U.S. liaison&#8221; will follow through with their plans to sue. I would hope Mr Taylor would also consider filing a lawsuit over what occured regarding the AmRen conference. </p>

<p>Ironically, those Federal laws are pejoratively named for a certain organization that likes to don white sheets, the one whose 30 members are split evenly between FBI/ATF agents, Federal law enforcement &#8220;informants&#8221;/agents provocatuers, and SPLC/ADL poseurs.  They were implemented out of fear of that particular group and its imitators.  Stragely, most of those who violate it are leftist extremists, even if they&rsquo;re not prosecuted.</p>

		<p>Anyone who likes history should read up on the events from 1931 to 1936 that lead to the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>A constitutional republic that was taken over by leftists who ignored the constitution in order to disenfranchise the right and bring about a socialist utopia.  A right that eventually gave up on the political system.  </p>

		<p>There needs to be special laws with stronger penalties against anyone threatening violence against speakers or organizers of speaking events. The  right to speak to a willing audience without such intimidation needs to be recognized &amp; protected - not just from government as the 1st Amendment stipulates, but protected also from malicious individuals. </p>

		<p>I really would like for you guys to bring legal action to those groups of people. Contact the hotels management and staff to collect the trail of intimidation. Also some good words on behalf <i>(amicus briefs???)</i> of your organization by the hotels that hosted the conference in the previous years would be good. Heres to a better next year.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Freedom of speech for me, but not thee.&#8221; That pretty much sums up the ideology of leftists/anti-racists. If they spew vitriol and harshly indict their fellow citizens, then they are being courageous and speaking the truth. However, if we speak out in favor of our interests, that&rsquo;s &#8220;hate speech.&#8221; &#8220;Hate speech&#8221; pretty much constitutes any statement made by a white person who isn&rsquo;t a self-hating Tim Wise type. </p>

		<p>The tactics of the left are a secular mirror image of those employed by islamists,ie shout down,or if necessary eliminate all who disagree.Having seen the farcical confrontation between the intellectual elite of Michigan State University and Mr Griffin on youtube it is patently obvious that they can no more be reasoned with than an illiterate Pashtan jihadhi.May the followers of these two irrational belief-systems rot in Hell(metaphorically). </p>

<p>I believe hate crimes legislation comes into the fore here. All of the offended rightist (as opposed to wrongist) parties should file suit against EVERY SINGLE MEMBER of each of these groups, to a)strip them of non-profit status, b) use RICO legislation to imprison these groups, and c) fine them for infringement of free speech rights.</p>

These types of things need to be exposed.  What is it with the left being such hypocrites?  Are they that insecure with different views that they have to shout them.  You can&rsquo;t have a conservation with any liberal without them getting rude, uncivilized, mean, or violent (one or all of the four I&rsquo;ve observed and experienced)</p>

The BNP-U.S. liaison is planning to file a complaint with the United States Department of Justice because elements of the Left conspired to deprive American citizens of their First Amendment right to peacefully assemble and participate in political discourse, which is in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241. That federal law states that &ldquo;If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State &hellip; in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having exercised the same; they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.&rdquo;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>These Bolshevik hoodlums need to be put out of business for good. They&rsquo;ve been getting away with this behavior, over and over, for far too long.  They&rsquo;re indulged by the authorities like merely naughty children, and they take the public&rsquo;s tolerance for granted. This has been going for 40 years, since the mid-60s, to the point where it&rsquo;s assumed to be their right. Anything tantrum is excused under the lofty pretense of defending &#8220;human rights&#8221;,  social justice&#8221;, &#8220;freedom&#8221;, &#8220;equality&#8221;.  These undisciplined brats need a good spanking!   A good ten-year prison term seems to be just the thing.   But under Obama and Holder (and Dorhn-Ayres) will this happen?</p>
<p>Particularly interesting was poster #8, regarding attempts to kidnap, loss of life, or attempts to kill. These laws must be applied to the hilt; and the recalcitrant authorities must be made to apply them, instead of doing it selectively. If this intimidation had been directed at a conference of the NAACP or the ADL, this would be a national case, the government would be all over it,  and the media would be frothing with outrage.  </p>
<p>Do we not have equal rights to peaceful assembly? The answer is glaringly obvious, and that just illustrates how far we&rsquo;ve fallen and the crying need for such a conference as this. Once, groups such as the NAACP were the outsiders, seeking recognition for their rights.  Now, they&rsquo;re the insiders, the Establishment (with a member in the White House!) determining who shall get what rights, while we are the outsiders, merely seeking the simple right to meet and talk. If we don&rsquo;t have even that, we have nothing.</p>

		<p>The threats of violence by the left here in the United States would appear to be a growing trend. It has been happening in Europe for quite a while now. Leftists take to the streets and break cinder blocks and throw them at cars and through the glass pane windows of homes and businesses. Don&rsquo;t forget the torching of expensive cars. The more liberalized the US becomes the more of that type of behavior we are going to see it would seem. What really &#8220;gets my goat&#8221; is that it effectively stifles free speech and free assembly only of course when that speech comes from someone or some group that is considered politically incorrect. There is something very wrong with this. There is something very wrong with allowing this to continue. </p>

		<p>The repression of free speech here shows the pattern of the same group over and over again.  If the USA were inclined to protect speech for ALL this would not be happening.  We now live in a state of oppressed and repressed opinions.  Congress participates to aid those whom they favor by writing laws against opposition.  I would not expect courts to rule against such authorities. US may quickly become a dictatorial state. Even the military (Fort Hood) has been compromised to PLEASE specific needs of certain groups. This power can only be maintained by forces outside Constitutional limits.  We are watching US history disintegrate!  Enemies domestic are at work! V </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a rich irony to contemplate that those very leftists who are forever screaming that mild, innocous, law-abiding groups like Amren are so violent and dangerous, are in fact THE VERY ONES who are practing the politics of violence and intimidation! &hellip; ie., they accuse others of doing the very things which are exactly what they are doing.  Hypocrites! </p>
<p>All our lives we&rsquo;ve been warned that the Brown Shirts are massing just around the corner to come and get you!  If you listen real hard, you can practically hear those jackboots coming now.  Nobody ever told us that the Bolshies are coming to get us   &mdash;    which, given present realities,  seems the <i>far greater </i> likelihood!  Why no warning about them?</p>
<p>(And btw, just what are &#8220;jackboots&#8221; anyway?  Come to think of it, I&rsquo;ve no idea, but they sure do sound scary!  We&rsquo;re so conditioned that we&rsquo;d do anything to avoid those awful jackboots. They&rsquo;re the equivalent of the boogeyman that I used to fear when I was five. Eventually I grew up and learned there was no boogeyman coming to get me.)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m writing from the UK where Nick Griffin&rsquo;s British National Party is making great advances in terms of modernising and reforming to move from being a group fighting the old race wars of its forebears and stupidly hanging on to nazis and other idiots who shame the movement, to basing it&rsquo;s politics not on hate but the realities of race, culture and politics in the UK.<br>
The UK has two choices. Either it can continue down a path where the indiginous native Britains are the only racial group not recognized by the state and in which third world concepts continue to undermine it&rsquo;s Greco-Romano judao-Christian identity and values, or it descends as much of America has into a third world spiral of decay where cultural relativism excuses failure and the real patriotism is to China and India and America&rsquo;s enemies and her enemies within.  <br>
What you will all miss most from Mr. Griffin&rsquo;s speech is his development of the concept of &#8216;electable nationalism&rsquo; which may yet be the governance of both our countries, now that both the British Conservatives and the US Republicans have now moved to the left.</p>
