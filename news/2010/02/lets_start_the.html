<h1>Let&rsquo;s Start The Day With Something Non-Controversial: Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Calcaterra, NBC Sports, February 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Moshe Mandel at TYU {snip} wonders:<blockquote>Baseball fans are commonly exposed to this sort of dichotomy, in which white players are often presented as gritty and do everything they can to maximize their talents, while minority players are &#8220;athletic&#8221; and &#8220;smooth,&#8221; and &#8220;make it look easy out there.&#8221; The successes of white players are attributed to effort, while the successes of non-white players are explained by inherent ability. Failures by minorities players are often explained by pointing to a lack of effort. Failures by white players have a way of occasionally being rationalized away or even forgotten.<br>
</blockquote>The scientific name for this is aversive racism, and it&rsquo;s pretty rampant. Orlando Hudson is fast. The white guy is a &#8220;possession receiver.&#8221; The black leftfielder is &#8220;gifted.&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>Take Larry Bird and Magic Johnson for example.  Larry used to say he suffered from &#8220;white mans disease&#8221;, ie he could not jump.  Genetically Magic was better suited for sports and Larry had to work harder and practice harder for the same result.</p>

		<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s split the difference:  Both the whites and the non-whites are blessed with some inherent ability, and therefore work to maximize it through effort and practice.  They are co-dependent virtues.</p>

		<p> Why couldn&rsquo;t one make the opposing argument: &#8220;Describing White athletic stars as &#8216;gritty&rsquo; and &#8216;hard-nosed&rsquo; while talking of &#8216;talent&rsquo; and &#8216;smoothness&rsquo; when it comes to black stars, implies unfairly that White athletes have no particular natural ability to speak of, and have to make up for that lack by trying harder.&#8221;</p>
<p> And suppose we were talking about two teams of college students in a &#8220;College IQ Bowl&#8221; where quick thinking and native ability were prerequisites, and we said, &#8220;The black students are &#8216;gritty&rsquo; and &#8216;hard-nosed,&rsquo; but the White students are just naturally smarter.&#8221; Why, we&rsquo;d be called racist, YET AGAIN, wouldn&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>Whites are far more athletic and &#8220;gifted&#8221; than blacks.  You don&rsquo;t see it because we are redlined from many sports.</p>
<p>Not banned, exactly.  But superior athletes are routinely diverted out of professional sports as a career while a small percentage are let in (but careful chosen to not be as good as many blacks).  Steroids and a whole host of other medical interventions are used to make blacks seem superior.</p>
<p>Sports are one giant scam.  Propaganda designed to instill inferiority in whites.</p>

<p>This is what &#8220;enlightened&#8221; people are supposed to believe but it is quite the opposite. Bill Buckner was an all-star white baseball player who made an error in the 1986 World Series that has never been forgotten. Meanwhile, players like Reggie Jackson (black) would make about 1 error every game and he is lauded as an all-time great.</p>
<p>Caste Football routinely reports on football games where announcers will describe a white receiver or running back as a &#8220;possession receiver&#8221; and make jokes about his speed while a black receiver will be praised for his &#8220;speed and athleticism.&#8221; Yet if you look up their 40 times the white will turn out to be a bit faster.<br>

		<p>The problem with this line of thinking is that people only consider American sports (i.e. Baseball, Basketball, Football) and seldom consider the plethora of sports involved in the summer and winter Olympics where both Whites and Blacks excel based on the event(s) built for their inherent natural traits.</p>
<p>However, an argument can definitely be made for Blacks having a natural ability in Baseball, Basketball and Football and Whites having to work harder; which is why so many Whites, and so few Blacks, are successful in coaching these particular sports.</p>
<p>The most successful coaches in all three of these major sports, are the ones that had very little natural ability when, and if, they were players (Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Tommy Lasorda, Pat Riley, etc.).</p>

		<p>I could buy the theory that black Africans are, on average, more gifted for those athletic endeavors that place a premium on speed, agility, and reflexes.  After all, if your evolutionary process developed in an environment in which it was eat or be eaten, required that you succeed in competition with prides of lions, solitary killers such as leopards, master assassins such as the Nile crocodile, herds of rampaging buffalo, avoid becoming the stuff between an elephant&rsquo;s toes, that you had to be able run down eland, wildebeeste, and assorted other game in order to survive, you&rsquo;d probably evolve into a species that was long-legged, generally tall, fleet of foot, and muscular. You&rsquo;d also develop a hide which was impervious to sunburn.  I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out the evolutionary purpose of the woolly hair.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those most valued as slaves in the New World were selected on the basis of size, strength, and apparent capacity for work and were often bred accordingly.</p>
<p>So yes, I can think of a few reasons why black Africans might well excel in the area of athletics, largely on a genetic basis.<br>
This is hardly a scientific genetic analysis, but it seems to make sense.</p>

		<p>The term, aversive Racism, intrigued me. Apparently, it aflicts only White men, and only social scientists can detect it. Those White men suffering from it do not realize their condition, and often remain in denial even after being so diagnosed by Social therepists. This shows that the battle against Racism is far from over, and so I wonder if America wll last long enough for for Racism in all its manifestations to be eliminated. I guess not.</p>

<p>Yes.  And as we settle in to watch the Winter Olympics, let us take note of how many whites we see, making efforts and succeeding due to their lack of talent.  (I predict another upsurge of complaints and discussion regarding the dearth of blacks in the WO).</p>
<p>Blacks succeed in big money professional sports in the U.S. because, 1. The Media has brainwashed even Larry Bird decided that he couldn&rsquo;t jump, even though there have been many gifted white high-jumpers and long jumpers in the past.  2.  Blacks are generally more inclined to take performance enhancing substances because they come from a culture that is less concerned with both ethics and health.  Americans are laughably ignorant of the plethora of sports in this world where blacks don&rsquo;t compete, or lack the physical disposition required in certain disciplines.<br>

		<p>It is done to make White people believe that they have genetic shortcomings which can be reduced by mating with non-Whites. Nothing can be further from the truth. Whites have the best combination of brains and brawn among all the races in the world which explains why they had conquered the world some centuries back.<br>
Northern and Eastern Europeans dominate Strongman contests. <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Strongest_Man" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World&rsquo;s_Strongest_Man</a></p>
<p>When it comes to raw natural strength Whites from north of the alps are the strongest race in the world.<br>
 The top wrestlers, swimmers, fighters, weight lifters, race car drivers and fighter pilots are overwhelmingly white.  In sports requiring a fast reaction time, such as table tennis, blacks do not stand a chance to compete with East Asians who are genetically specialised in that trait. The only people who can compete with East Asians in such sports at all are Whites. West Africans are specialised for being fast, as in sprinting, they are rubbish in endurance events and vice versa for the Kenyans who are specialised for endurance, and once again, whites are second to only West African blacks in sprinting, second to only Kenyans/East Africans when it comes to endurance events. Blacks are also specialised for winning in boxing but recently Whites from Eastern Europe have taken over. The media may have lost interest in boxing as a result but the facts do not change. Blacks are pathetic in swimming and the only race which can give a serious fight to Whites in this event are East Asians. In other words, Whites are the generalised specialised race while blacks and East Asians are just mere specialised races, specialised in a narrow range of physical and mental traits. Overall Whites have the best physical and mental package and thus can be called the most gifted race. Super generalised races like South Asians, South East Asians, Middle Easterners etc&hellip; are pathetic in  Olympic like sports. India with a population of 1 billion barely manages to win a medal or two in any Olympic event.<br>
In the 2004 Summer Olympic, of the 929 medals awarded, approximately 70 percent, or 650, were won by white athletes.  East Asian athletes won 154 medals, or 16.6 percent, while black athletes won 89 medals, or just 9.6 percent of the total.  The rest were won by athletes from other groups. Yes! Blacks as a race won the least number of medals, most people would find it hard to believe this as blacks are always portrayed as superhuman athletes by the media. <br>
In the 2006 Winter Olympics, of the 252 medals awarded, 228, or almost 91 percent, were won by white athletes.  East Asian athletes won just over 9 percent of the medals, with 23 total, and only one medal was won by a black person, which is obvious as blacks find it hard to deal with cold weather. Do not let the media propaganda fool you. <br>

		<p>The 1972 Miami Dolphins still remain the only pro team to have an undefeated season including winning the Superbowl.  They did this with a majority of their top players offensively and defensively being white including an all-white backfield comprised of QB Bob Griese and running backs Larry Csonka and Jim Kiick.  </p>
<p>The last time I watched a football game in its entirety was the 1983 Super Bowl when white Redskins RB John Riggins was the game MVP and set what was at the time a new SB record of 168 yards rushing.  I use the above 2 examples to illustrate the impossibility of the overall athletic ability of whites having diminished so greatly in such a relatively short period and obviously there are a number of other factors at play here.  I&rsquo;ll leave that to other posts.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suggest visiting <a href="https://tinyurl.com/nw4cte" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/nw4cte</a> for some excellent articles of sports related nature and the already mentioned <a href="https://www.castefootball.us/" rel="nofollow">https://www.castefootball.us/</a> for more reading on the subject generally.  These days, given the anti-white nature of the medium, I don&rsquo;t watch TV at all and could care less about sports for the same reason.  </p>

		<p>virtually all sports journalists are very liberal and write or speak in glowing terms of black atheletes in spite of their criminal behavior,many arrests for serious crimes,ie; rapes, dog fighting and even murder that gets lowered to manslaughter charges. lary bird was the best ball player of his time, todays time as well not because he was the fanciest, but because he was on target, a leader too. the nba head, the nfl head, baseball too, all liberals as are many team owners. remember all the hoopla when rush limbaugh was going to be a sports announcer? then when he was buying into a sports team as part owner? this is why there are so many blks in sports. white atheletes in the past also worked a full time job, then played sports for the fun of it. blacks didn&rsquo;t work, they played games all day.</p>

		<p>Blacks are overrepresented in sports because they&rsquo;re seeked out over whites.  Plus, their natural aggressive, uncivilized, and rude behavior makes them appear more superior than whites.  Black athletes (and other black celebrities) make lots of money, yet they&rsquo;re broke soon after and don&rsquo;t pay their taxes and then complain they&rsquo;re being picked on because they&rsquo;re black.</p>

		<p>The major sports media is made up of individuals who are racists in that they believe in black superiority. In last season&rsquo;s Ohio big school high school football championship game, the predominantly white (one black starter) Hilliard team, defeated the all black Glenville team. The all white defensive line for Hilliard averaged about 210 lbs. The all black ofensive line, for Glenville, looked the size of an NFL offensive line and appeared to average an obese 300 lbs or better. Yet, the smaller quicker (and dare I say more athletic) all white defensive line of Hilliard manhandled the behemoths of Glenville througout the game. I have seen this phenomena time and again at the high school level, where an all white team defeats the all black team. I have spoken to others in different states, who regulary witness the same thing. </p>

		<p>Intelligence as well as strenght and agility make a superstar. A few blacks, like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, have all three. Most blacks don&rsquo;t have intelligence, that is, the ability to analyze the tactical situation on the field or on the court. Larry Bird and other great white players had that ability. Look at Duke&rsquo;s basketball teams or a Ted Williams or a white pitcher who wins 20+ games.  But intelligece is cut out of the scouting reports or draft reports of most scouts.</p>

<p>This is an interesting post.  I don&rsquo;t watch professional sports, but when I have noticed games like the recent Superbowl, I think I do notice that more black players appear obese than in the past.  This could upend the entire trend and intention of those who would destroy the white male! <br>

		<p>Look at a football game from the 50s or 60s. Its a different game. I was watching the 1967 Superbowl rerun. All whites on the field..and the game is one of positioning, tactics, cooperation.<br>
Its very cerebral. Now look at todays game..chest bumping, rain forest dances, constant clowning for the camera. And todays commentary. No one talks about &#8220;the play&#8221;, its about &#8220;the player&#8221;. In the older game you dont hear the hysteria about this individuals antics..its about how the team coordinated to make something much happen. </p>

		<p>Jasper, I noticed that you conveniently left out the most recent Summer 2008 Olympics. No one else (except for &#8220;White Nationalists&#8221;) would bother tallying medals by race. Everyone simply notes which countries perform well, and the best by far is China. The Chinese only started competing in the Olympics since like 1980, and in only 1 generation have risen to Olympic gold medal glory. </p>
<p>All the best Asian nations - China, Japan and Korea - were represented in the top 10 at the summer games (the Summer Olympics are really the only games that matter since everyone goes to it. Less than half the world goes the Winter Olympics). I would stop all this chest-beating about White brute strength before it looks like overcompensation for something. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read about the so-called Black athletic superiority many times, and I have just about had it!</p>
<p>Look at all the poor, scrawny, and often sick African Blacks that can be seen on television. Do they seem like Supermen to you?</p>
<p>If some people want to convince us that Blacks possess some kind of physical superiority, then let&rsquo;s do some serious research, in the genetic field, among many things, so we can collect a large body of reliable data. And then, we&rsquo;ll have an honest discussion about race.</p>

		<p>Blacks more athletic than whites?  Ha.  The story of the all black vs all white football team immediately springs to mind after reading this post.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, it was a high school championship football game that consisted of one team that was all black and one team that was all white.  The latter stomped the former, it could hardly have been called a match.</p>
<p>How many blacks got athletic scholarships compared to whites?  If I remember correctly it was something around 11 blacks to 3 whites.  There&rsquo;s your answer right there.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So yes, I can think of a few reasons why black Africans might well excel in the area of athletics, largely on a genetic basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah - I remember 15 years ago people saying the same thing about boxing.</p>
<p>Blacks have thicker skulls, genetically superior, white cannot compete in boxing. Look at boxing today - blacks have been run out of it on a rail by aggressive east European athletes who didn&rsquo;t grow up being brainwashed about black superiority.</p>
<p>Boxing is now the whitest it&rsquo;s been since the 1930&rsquo;s. Not so shockingly there is no more comedy skits about terrible white fighters and boxing coverage has fallen dramatically in recent years.</p>

		<p>Guys, I am entirely sympathetic to the viewpoint here at Amren. I&rsquo;m also a huge football fan; I hate the antics and the clowning and the selfishness, but I love watching football played at the highest levels.</p>
<p>I too watch old highlights from the 60s and 70s. If you can&rsquo;t see the difference in agility and quickness of an Adrian Peterson over a John Riggins, you are guilty of the same kind of ideological blinders that you accuse the race deniers of having.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple: Blacks can run faster, cut quicker and jump higher. That is why there hasn&rsquo;t been a starting white cornerback in over a decade, or a starting white running back in years. Genetics, the same thing that endows whites with greater IQ, gifted blacks with greater agility on foot. Don&rsquo;t be a race denier yourself.</p>
<p>We should be welcoming the kinds of obvious racial differences that give blacks an advantage; it&rsquo;s a great way to appeal to the altruistic nature of whites when arguing FOR our cause!</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say &#8220;reverse&#8221; racism doesn&rsquo;t exist in pro football. White quarterbacks are head and shoulders better than their black counterparts, yet year after year we&rsquo;re forced to endure Donovan McNabb&rsquo;s overthrows and Vince Young&rsquo;s boring, run-first instincts.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jasper, I noticed that you conveniently left out the most recent Summer 2008 Olympics. No one else (except for &ldquo;White Nationalists&rdquo;) would bother tallying medals by race. Everyone simply notes which countries perform well, and the best by far is China. The Chinese only started competing in the Olympics since like 1980, and in only 1 generation have risen to Olympic gold medal glory. </p>
<p>All the best Asian nations - China, Japan and Korea - were represented in the top 10 at the summer games (the Summer Olympics are really the only games that matter since everyone goes to it. Less than half the world goes the Winter Olympics). I would stop all this chest-beating about White brute strength before it looks like overcompensation for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then this guy goes and tallies by race when it suits him. </p>
<p>Whites should tally by race since we win the most medals in both Olympics but are seldom described as the most athletic or given the sponsorships or opportunities handed out to black athletes.</p>

<p>Duh.  China has 1.3 billion people.  They can literally spam any given Summer Olympics with athletes and walk away with a huge medal tally.  </p>
<p>Phyllis Schlafly has posited an interesting theory about what you said about China, Japan and the Koreas winning so many Summer Oly medals.  I haven&rsquo;t given it enough thought to conclude whether I agree with it or not, but it&rsquo;s a valid theory.  She thinks that fanatical enforcement of Title IX has forced many high schools and colleges to eliminate high-expense sports and clubs for men, (and a few women&rsquo;s as well) that there isn&rsquo;t the development in sports like diving and gymnastics in the United States that there once was, and of course, China isn&rsquo;t encumbered by feminist nonsense.</p>

		<p>Suburban Refugee&rsquo;s post makes no sense.  If the best white athletes from 30 years ago were good enough to win super bowl MVP at running back, why wouldn&rsquo;t any of the best white athletes today be good enough to make a starting roster at that position?  Did blacks magically become much better athletes in a generation?  It&rsquo;s not like blacks were being kept out of the NFL in 1983.</p>

		<p>North East Asians (Japanese, Koreans, Chinese etc&hellip;) have some genetic advantages as well. They tend to win the most medals after Whites. North East Asians are the most gifted people in both brains and physical abilities among the Asians. South Asians like Indians/Pakistanis, South East Asians like Filipinos and Middle Easterners like Arabs, all seem hapless infront of North East Asians in sports as well as IQ. In other words they are like the &#8216;White people&rsquo; of Asia.</p>

		<p>As the game evolved, speed, and most importantly, quickness (agility) became a much more valuable commodity than power. Especially in the skill positions, such as cornerback and running back. Power means nothing in today&rsquo;s NFL if you can&rsquo;t make guys miss. That&rsquo;s quickness. </p>
<p>Whites may be about as fast, but they are definitely not as quick. Experts scratched their heads for years as to why Tim Dwight, a white receiver/kick returner and fast as a bolt of a lightning, couldn&rsquo;t take that leap into greatness. Straight line speed, however, was useless when he couldn&rsquo;t break out of a cut faster than the guy covering him.</p>
<p>Would I love to see an all-white NFL? Of course I would. I can hardly tolerate the clown-shoeing. I would love to see a headier, more teamwork-oriented game (&#8220;&hellip;what we&rsquo;re looking for is a seal here, and a seal here!&#8221;). But to think there wouldn&rsquo;t be some trade-offs in natural ability is absurd.</p>

<p>Then why do all-white (or almost all-white ) teams usually beat all-black teams in high school football championship games?</p>
<p>Why do white boxers from Europe now dominate at the middle to upper weight classes in boxing (not to mention in MMA)?</p>
<p>Why do all-white basketball teams from Europe often defeat the all-black teams from the U.S. in international competitions?</p>

<p>Ok Steve Sailer. Let&rsquo;s not forget to talk about their greater natural speaking and performing ability, too. THen no one will think you are a racist. Guess you have to be a racist to &#8216;not be one&rsquo;.</p>

Well spake.  As a denizen of the greater Philadelphia area I&rsquo;ve had to endure the excruciating near-greatness of Donovan McNabb for the past decade.  He&rsquo;s always reminded me of Sandy Koufax early in his career, a man with phenomenal talent, who was almost unhittable when he was on, but barely a .500 pitcher until he found himself in the early Sixties.  One gets the sense that Eagles management keeps hoping that it&rsquo;ll finally all come together one day for McNabb.  In any event, I seriously doubt that McNabb&rsquo;s race has anything to do with his retention by the Eagles.  If he were white, Chinese, or Eskimo people would still be alternately cheering and cursing him.  I suspect that he&rsquo;s a very frustrated and often unhappy man.</p>

		<p>The comparison between Adrian Peterson &amp; John Riggins is not a good one. Peterson is a small scat back. Riggins was big, fast and powerful. Riggins played at a very high level for about 13 years. Peterson&rsquo;s numbers are already starting to decline in just his second year. Wes Welker runs a 4.6 forty yard dash, the same as Jerry Rice, Plaxico Burris and a whole host of other black wide receivers who are never tagged with the &#8220;possession receiver&#8221; name. Dustin Fox was an All American corner-back at Ohio State. He was the fastest player on the squad. He could dunk a basketball when he was 13 years old. When drafted by the NFL he was made to switch from his natural position of corner-back to safety, a position he had never played before. If Dustin had been black, he would have been left at corner. Payton Hillis sits on the bench with the Denver Broncos. Last year, due to injuries, he got to start at tailback. He averaged close to 100 yards rushing and 50 yards receiving each game he started. He showed so much promise as a tailback. Toby Gerhart was the best running back in college football last year. We will see if the NFL gives Toby a chance to start at tailback, or if the try to convert him to an H-back or tight-end. Based on recent NFL history, I would bet on the latter.</p>
