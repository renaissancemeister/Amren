<h1>Former Clayton NAACP Treasurer Charged With Pilfering Funds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Boone, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former top Clayton NAACP official  &mdash;  accused of embezzling up to $30,000 from the venerable civil rights organization  &mdash;  is finally getting her day in court some three years after charges were first filed.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege the funds were stolen by Donna Hall Lemons during her tenure as Clayton NAACP treasurer from 2004-06. The 51-year-old McDonough woman was charged in Oct. 2006 but for reasons unknown her case was never tried by then-Clayton District Attorney Jewel Scott.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The case was revived following the 2008 election of Tracy Graham Lawson as Clayton&rsquo;s new district attorney. In December the D.A.&rsquo;s office refiled three felony theft charges against the former NAACP treasurer. After Lemons missed her Jan. 6 arraignment a bench warrant was served and within five days she was locked up with no bail until Monday&rsquo;s arraignment, when a $5,000 bond was set.</p>
<p>Her trial is scheduled to begin March 15</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re lying if they say she stole,&#8221; said Lemons&rsquo; sister, Tujuanna Brown, 43. &#8220;The Clayton NAACP doesn&rsquo;t get that much money in donations anyway.&#8221;</p>

Accused of embezzling $30,000.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   Pocket change . Every since we fully integrated here in the black belt in the fall of 1970,another public school goes missing a million dollars or more every few years.Before integration,when whites administered to even the black schools,it never happened . </p>

		<p>At the risk of sounding like my handle, I have to say, again, that any time you give any kind of fiscal power to a black, you are going to end up missing a lot of money.  It never fails.  They can&rsquo;t seem to get that the money they&rsquo;re supposed to be the custodians of isn&rsquo;t there for their personal pilfering.  Show me a black CEO or treasurer of ANY organization - and I&rsquo;ll show you an organization that got stolen blind and probably involved in some sort of drug or sex scandal (or both).  This is evidentiary - it isn&rsquo;t just generalizing.  Even the Most Holy Rev. Jackson had his out-of-wedlock daughter&hellip;.  It also calls to mind the mayor of D.C.  Even the PTA president at a school I taught at took off one day with all the funds   &mdash;   and all of her fellow blacks said, &#8220;Well, she needed the money&hellip;.&#8221;  Utter failure to comprehend the nature of public service.  Makes me think we&rsquo;d best watch the head honcho in THIS country - and a bunch of his appointed henchmen&hellip;</p>

		<p>A Black stealing from Blacks? So what else is new? I&rsquo;ve always maintained Blacks are always their own worst enemies. But to come to terms with that idea takes a bit of introspective thinking.</p>
