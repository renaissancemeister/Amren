<h1>NY Gov. Paterson Won&rsquo;t Seek New Term</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Sidoti, Washington Examiner, February 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Democratic Gov. David Paterson, bedeviled by a domestic-violence scandal involving a top aide and lacking support in his own party, has found himself severely weakened as he tries to save the state from insolvency and run for a full term in the fall.</p>
<p>Even longtime friends say he may not be able to do both.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Paterson was hit by press reports that he and state police had contacted a woman involved in a Halloween confrontation with one of his advisers at her home. That prompted some key Democrats from Washington to New York to urge Paterson to drop his underdog bid for election.</p>
<p>Hours later, Paterson&rsquo;s criminal justice czar resigned, saying that she was misled by Paterson&rsquo;s appointed state police superintendent and that any contact by the governor and state police with the woman was &#8220;unacceptable regardless of their intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Paterson finds himself hamstrung from taking action on the state&rsquo;s fiscal crisis that helped his cellar-dwelling polls before. He&rsquo;s not even meeting with legislative leaders in his own party with whom he needs to negotiate a budget by April 1.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perkins [Sen. Bill Perkins, a Democrat representing Paterson&rsquo;s old Harlem district] said he and other longtime friends of Paterson are urging he drop his campaign, especially in light of the resignation of Criminal Justice Services Commissioner Denise O&rsquo;Donnell.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cabinet, so to speak, is falling apart,&#8221; Perkins said.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported Wednesday on court papers showing a phone call between state police and the woman who accused Paterson&rsquo;s aide, who was her boyfriend at the time. Paterson&rsquo;s office acknowledges he talked to the woman but says she placed the call, and a spokesman for the governor denied anyone tried to keep the woman from pursuing a domestic-violence case.</p>
<p>Paterson suspended the aide, David Johnson, without pay on Wednesday and hasn&rsquo;t made Johnson available to comment or answer questions. He had no immediate comment about O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s resignation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The turmoil stems from a Halloween 2009 argument between Johnson and Sherruna Booker, 40, according to a police report. The woman told police Johnson was angry about her costume, choked her, tried to rip the clothing from her body and pushed her into a mirror.</p>
<p>Booker appeared in Family Court three times after she filed the police report Oct. 31. She dropped her case abruptly on Feb. 8, when she didn&rsquo;t show up at court.</p>

						<p>
							<i>BBC News, February 26, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>New York Governor David Paterson has withdrawn from the race for state governor amid a scandal involving one of his aides.</p>
<p>He had announced his campaign formally only last weekend but had faced pressure to quit.</p>
<p>He said he had never abused his office, but was &#8220;being realistic about politics&#8221;.</p>
<p>There had been criticism over how he handled allegations about an aide and domestic abuse.<br>

		<p>Look at the news just today: Paterson, the black governor of NY is the subject of numerous investigations and exposes; the black party planner (Desiree Rogers) or whatever she was is leaving the White House after screwing up her job, allowing major security breaches, and her and the White House blaming the Secret Service; Rangel is (again) under ethics violations, it just never ends.</p>
<p>It was so bad in NY even black New Yorkers were beginning to turn on Paterson.  I guess that&rsquo;s our big hope in the short term: that things will be so bad that blacks themselves will turn on the incompetents.</p>

		<p>In all fairness, nearly all of our politicians here in New York stink pretty bad.  Regardless of the race of whoever replaces Paterson I don&rsquo;t expect any improvement.<br>

<p><br>
WR has a reasonable point. However, the issue here is not whether they stink (they all do), but how much they stink.  Not all politicians stink equally!  <br>
And, yes, race DOES seem to have something to do with it.</p>

<p>The only way blacks &#8220;turn on&#8221; their own is to not turn out to support one. They&rsquo;ll almost never actually vote against one of their own and vote for a White person. That&rsquo;s what happened with that world class moron, David Dinkins in NYC. Enough blacks didn&rsquo;t show up to vote, so Guiliani was able to just barely squeak out a victory.</p>

		<p>People just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Bernanke, yesterday, basically put Congress in its place as to who really runs this country.  The US is defaulting on its national debt under the Obama administration.  They are doing so by having the fed print up money to buy treasury notes that no one wants.  This is absolutely necessary if the fed is to create the money that Congress wants to spend.</p>
<p>However, that puts in dire jeopardy the profit of those who actually own the fed.  So they sent Bernanke to tell (not to advise, not to the ask) the Congress that no more debt will be monetized.  What that means in real terms is a hard cap on congressional spending.  Further, he told (not advised, recommended or asked) congress that cuts will have to be made to social security, medicaid and &#8220;entitlement spending&#8221;.  What he recommended was that Congress enact a plan that basically would reduce their spending to a comfortable level so that the public would stop being aware that they are running up against a hard cap dictated to them by the fed (instead of the other way around&hellip;.cough).</p>
<p>What this means is there will soon be forced (forced by the fed) cuts to spending on social programs.</p>
<p>Those cuts will come under whomever is present in government during the next cycle.  It will have nothing to do with what they may or may not want or whomever elected them to office based on whatever they happened to have promised or hold to politically.  All that is irrelevant.  Bernanke and the fed control congressional spending&hellip;.not the other way around.</p>
<p>That is why you see democrats &#8220;retiring&#8221;, even in races they are practically guaranteed to win.  They don&rsquo;t want to be blamed for the cuts.</p>
<p>Paterson is no different.  Cuts are coming to New York, especially New York City.  Paterson hopes to be long gone.</p>
<p>But, if the economy booms (increasing what it&rsquo;s possible to spend spend spend), he&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
<p>They all will.</p>
