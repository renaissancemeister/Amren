<h1>MARTA &#8216;Yellow Line&rsquo; to Doraville Angers Some in Asian Community</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Chapman and Ariel Hart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Asian-American activists offended that MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] re-named the train line into the heart of Atlanta&rsquo;s Asian community the &#8220;yellow line&#8221; will take their objections to the transit agency&rsquo;s chief on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yellow,&#8221; as a term for skin color, carries a generally negative, racist connotation among Asians.</p>
<p>MARTA officials were warned by an employee before the name change last October that Atlanta&rsquo;s burgeoning Asian community would find the term for the line to Doraville offensive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Park and other Asian activists plan to meet Friday with MARTA CEO Beverly Scott. They hope MARTA will change the line&rsquo;s name from yellow to gold.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MARTA launched the color-coded lines Oct. 1 to help passengers navigate the system more easily. Transit officials noted that other systems, including Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, use similar color codes. MARTA designates its lines red, green, blue and yellow.</p>
<p>John Yasutake, MARTA&rsquo;s former manager of equal opportunity and conflict resolution, attended what he called &#8220;a senior staff meeting&#8221; Sept. 1 where the proposed name changes for the Doraville line and other routes were discussed. Scott did not attend the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Hold on folks, do you realize that there&rsquo;s a very large Asian community in Doraville and the surrounding area?&#8221; Yasutake recalled Monday. &#8220;I was offended as an Asian man. Would we run a line through East Point or the West End and call it the &#8216;black&rsquo; line?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In her response to Yasutake, Scott said, {snip} &#8220;this gives us added impetus to increase both our internal and external cultural diversity efforts to maximize the Asian American community&rsquo;s inclusion in the Authority&rsquo;s contracts and procurements, job recruitment, community outreach and sensitivity training.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The color yellow has a long history of being used in a negative way when referring to Asians.  The so-called &#8220;yellow peril,&#8221; which entered the U.S. vernacular in the 19th century with the arrival of Chinese immigrants, raised racist fears of an assault on Western values and standards of living. Fear of the &#8220;yellow scourge&#8221; returned in force after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor at the onset of World War II.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody who rides MARTA knows that the line going up through that area is heavily Asian,&#8221; said Robert Bullard, director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University. &#8220;These are always sensitive issues. Anticipation of concern and sensitivity, and the outreach, probably should have been done before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott said she heard complaints from the employee and a few advocacy group leaders.  At a recent community forum, she asked some Asian-Americans if they were offended and said they told her they weren&rsquo;t.  She noted that Asian and American cities that have public transit call some routes yellow lines.  However, she stressed that she is ready to listen.</p>
<p>MARTA employs 13 people in its diversity office.  They focus on equal opportunity in employment and disadvantaged business and perform some community outreach.</p>

<p>Talk about &#8220;yellow&#8221;:  What a cowardly response!</p>
<p>So what if they change it to red:  are they Commies?  To green:  are they envious, or all about money?  To blue:  are they &#8220;blue&#8221; liberals?</p>
<p>So if you live in Doraville (which ironically does linguistically mean &#8220;gold town&#8221;), can you paint your house yellow?</p>

		<p>Though, it&rsquo;s quite appropriate that Harvard University is served by the Boston subway&rsquo;s Red Line!  (The Red Line also goes to MIT, land of Noam Chomsky, the late Paul Samuelson, and various poli-sci profs of ruddy ideological stripe.)</p>
<p>Railfan factoid:  the Boston MBTA was the first in the US and likely the world to color-code its lines.  The concept was originated by a sleek architecture firm, Cambridge Seven Associates, which also designed one of the coolest MBTA stations (Porter Square on the Red Line) and the Aquarium.  Before the color-coding, the lines had tongue-tying names like &#8220;Cambridge-Dorchester Line&#8221; and &#8220;Main Line Elevated&#8221;, or even more than one name for different sections of the same track. </p>

		<p>Good grief. It reminds me, as a boxing fan, of when civil rights groups began protesting the fact that the two non-neutral corners of the ring were denoted the &#8220;Black Corner&#8221; and the &#8220;White Corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve attended any post-racial boxing match, you&rsquo;ll note that the corners are almost always now referred to as the &#8220;Red Corner&#8221; and the &#8220;Blue Corner.&#8221; </p>
<p>For whatever reason, Native American boxers don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with whether or not they are assigned to the &#8220;Red Corner.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In China, yellow associated with royalty. The &#8220;yellow&#8221; usage is just an excuse for the Asians to kick White men around. Note how they are receiving help from the Liberals. Also note some of high level positions: &#8220;manager of equal opportunity and conflict resolution&#8221;, &#8220;director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University&#8221;, as well as a staff of 13 for the MARTA diversity office. I give up!</p>

<p>Right. In Chicago the various transit lines have &#8220;colored&#8221; names. Red line, blue line, brown line, etc.</p>
<p>This is standard practice everywhere?</p>
<p>NOW, rethink, rethink, rethink. Maybe a civil suit is in store here. A class action law suit to provide monetary compensation for all those who need their feelings assuaged!</p>

		<p>Really though, they should have known better. You shouldn&rsquo;t go out of your way to give them an excuse to file a complaint. If they had called it the gold line, probably no one would have taken offense and they could have pointed to the fact that Doraville does indeed mean &#8220;Gold Town&#8221;, as someone already pointed out.</p>

		<p>These Orientals have learned from the Blacks how much fun it is to make Whitey jump.  Are we now to remove the word &#8220;yellow&#8221; from our vocabulary entirely?  Do foreigners now have veto power over the English language?  If they name some rail line that only passes through White neighborhoods the Yellow Line, and a bunch of Orientals move in later, will they change the name to the Orange Line?  <br>
     Words cannot express the contempt I have for White officials who will not ask these kinds of questions, and demand answers.  All anyone has to do insist that these people explain themselves, and the absurdity of their positions shows itself.  Many of us have had the experience of seeing a liberal lose all composure when forced to justify their views.  Are there no White officeholders willing to publicly interrogate and humiliate these invading ingrates?  Willing to get in their faces and say: &#8220;Shut up.  You don&rsquo;t own the color yellow&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Yellow,&rdquo; as a term for skin color, carries a generally negative, racist connotation among Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>What?  WHAT????  So let me get this straight, it&rsquo;s not &#8220;racist&#8221; to call a white person a white person, or a black person a black person, but it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; to call a yellow person a yellow person?  Well, by that logic, if we are supposed to call them &#8220;Asians&#8221; (Asia includes people of both Caucasoid and Mongoloid races, by the way&#8221;, then shouldn&rsquo;t all whites be referred to as Europeans? </p>
<p>This is as ridiculous as when I read in many articles (including on in today&rsquo;s AmRen list about the Bronx homebuying thing) the reporter will use &#8220;white and African American&#8221; IN THE SAME SENTENCE.  Not only is it grammatically incorrect, but it&rsquo;s also racist.  Sometimes in conversation, I&rsquo;ll refer to &#8220;European Americans and blacks&#8221;&hellip;nobody has ever mentioned that, but if they ever do, I will refer to the census bureau&rsquo;s definition of &#8220;whites&#8221; as original peoples of Europe, Middle East and North Africa and state that I&rsquo;m specifically referring to European Americans.</p>

		<p>Frank #3, rainbow absolutely can not be used - the gays would pitch a royal tantrum. Brown (racist Hispanic), black (racist afro-American), red (racist American Indian), yellow (racist Asian), purple(also racist gay pride), white (racist caucasian), pink (anti male), blue (anti femnist), green (anti environment), are all racist colors and should be taken out of the crayon box.

Even here in the Washington, D.C. area nobody has complained about the inherent &#8220;bigotry&#8221; in the Metro Yellow Line, though certain Native American groups have kept up their gambit to change the nickname of the Washington Redskins.

		<p>Do not let LEGAL IMMIGRANT asians and their geneline in america define the terms of the debate. Shutting off to 0 asian LEGAL IMMIGRATON was a great benefit to NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS in the past. This current complaint by asians about the &#8220;Yellow Line&#8221; is hardball asian racial politics&hellip;.it goes right back-a straight line infact to the Chinese Exclusion Act.</p>
<p>Do not let the asians in OUR AMERICA hit US over the head repeatedly about  the Chinese Exclusion Act was a blight on AMERICA. It wasn&rsquo;t. The Chinese Exclusion Act was a wonderfull policy that protected the legitimate racial interests of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. WE can thank an Irish Immigrant and Socialist and labor leader Samuel Gompers for its passage.</p>
<p>Asians demand that NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS commit racial suicide in the nation they founded and created. NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS are under no obligation to commit racial suicide because it would make asians and their geneline in America happy.</p>

<p>This will be the second time a submitted the post I just sent through. Why it was blocked the first time is a mystery to me. The asians must be confrontrd head on. My post goes right to the heart of the issue which is:for the asians in America, everything revolves around their exclusion in the 18th century. This issue must be addresed head on . No one else is doing but yours truly. So let the dam post go through.</p>

		<p>Shawn- Orange is going to offend the Catholics (it&rsquo;s the colour of the Protestant Orange Order and Ulster unionism). Green will offend the Unionists and the British by a similar ticket.</p>
<p>Blue is heteropatriarchalist- does anybody have domestic violence stats for those neighbourhoods? Pink would cause offence to any gays who live near the line, red is an affront to Russians and Amerindians, brown is right out, as is black, grey offends the elderly, purple is imperialist.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s every colour on the London Underground map out then. Oddly enough, our brown line (the Bakerloo line) goes through the south Asian republic of Wembley)</p>

<p>I agree when you say they must be confronted, Jupiter. But I think that compared to Blacks and violent Latino illegals, the Asians look like not as serious a threat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing, though: unlike Blacks and Latinos, Asians are smart, hard working, are more often than not, ambitious. The fact that they usually are polite and clean, must not distract us from the fact they are a threat&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that while Asians might be dealt with by reducing the number of Asians that may come to the US, Black and Latino street gangs must be dealt with using whatever force is necessary. And now!</p>
