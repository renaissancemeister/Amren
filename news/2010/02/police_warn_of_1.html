			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Telegraph, February 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some young children in Britain are being indoctrinated to hate non-Muslims and champion a holy war, according to a new documentary.</p>
<p>&#8220;No child is ever too young to be started off on Jihad training,&#8221; states one document recovered by police from the North West&rsquo;s Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) during raids.</p>
<p>CTU officers, interviewed by the BBC&rsquo;s Inside Out team for a special programme, show the document and a film they recovered of two children aged about three and six playing with a pistol and Kalashnikov rifle.</p>
<p>The officers say the discoveries are evidence of attempts to radicalise youngsters. The footage, which police believe was filmed in Pakistan, was uncovered on the hard drive of a suspect&rsquo;s computer  &mdash;  though investigators have not revealed when the material was seized.</p>
<p>The video shows a girl and young boy playing with guns, which police believe are real. &#8220;What do you do with the weapon?&#8221; asks a man&rsquo;s voice. He answers his own question: &#8220;I want to kill the infidels.&#8221;</p>
<p>A senior CTU officer, who cannot be identified for security reasons, tells the programme makers: &#8220;We believe this was filmed abroad. We have no idea who the children are. We were shocked to find it at the house. We have no reason to believe this is faked. The guns are real.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer said of another raid: &#8220;We found a series of flash cards and documents on how to raise Mujahid children. The cards were written in English  &mdash;  and instead of having M for Muhammad they had M for Mujahideen. They have the potential to indoctrinate. It just shows the mindset of some people and what we are up against.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police also found documents downloaded from an extremist website instructing parents to raise Mujahid children. The documents say: &#8220;The key is to start instilling these values in them while they are babies. Don&rsquo;t wait until they are seven. No child is ever too young to be started off on Jihad training.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Thompson, Assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said the majority of the Muslim population supported the police&rsquo;s counterterror operations in the region.</p>
<p>He told the BBC: &#8220;My view is that the majority of the community across the board see the threat that we&rsquo;re dealing with and are hugely supportive.&#8221;</p>
<p>MP Kim Howells, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to see and I hope I never have to see it again actually. That&rsquo;s as serious a piece of evidence of the kind of thing we are up against as I have ever set eyes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anjum Anwar MBE, who works for the church as a community dialogue development officer, said the film must not be used to implicate the rest of the Muslim world.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much indoctrination going on here.  Muslim children don&rsquo;t need to be brainwashed to hate white people because they would hate white people anyway as a natural consequence of racial differences and white liberal ideology of racial equality.  To put it another way, if &#8220;indoctrination&#8221; was all that mattered, then it should stand to reason that there should be non-Muslim children &#8220;taught&#8221; to hate non-Muslims.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new in the culture of the Middle East. </p>
<p>That Englishmen would find this shocking indicates to me that this generation of Britons are far less worldly than their forebearers.</p>
<p>The generation that grew up in post-war Britain are about the dumbest and most naive in centuries. An immediate inquiry should occupy the national consciousness to uncover how and why this came about, and seek to remedy it.</p>

		<p>FEARS are emerging that vulnerable children might be groomed for religious extremism or even terrorism at taxpayers&rsquo; expense. Muslim pupils are being taken out of classes and sent to study at Islamic schools, or madrassas. A pilot scheme, the Open Madrasah Network, has received a Â£550,000 government grant to pay for under-achievers to attend lessons in Arabic, Urdu and religion.  The classes, described as booster lessons for primary and GCSE age pupils, are already running at four madrassas in Bradford, West Yorkshire. If pupils show improvement, the scheme is likely to be rolled out nationally. But critics say it will lead to the risk of taxpayers&rsquo; money being spent on &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; organisations. Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society, said: &ldquo;These institutions are devoted almost entirely to pumping Islam into the heads of their pupils. We need to know who will keep tabs on these indoctrination centres to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is properly spent. &ldquo;Although there is no suggestion that the Yorkshire scheme is suspect, if this kind of idea rolls out, who knows what will happen?&rdquo;  There are almost 1,600 madrassas in Britain, where 200,000 children attend evening classes to study the Koran.  But anti-terror police fear that extremists could indoctrinate pupils with anti-Western sentiments. Last year, pupils at madrassas reported being slapped and punched by teachers.  The row prompted Keighley MP Ann Cryer to say: &ldquo;We should have some sort of review into how madrassas are run. &ldquo;They seem to be a law unto themselves.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Britain is finished anyway. If taxi drivers can&rsquo;t put up signs saying that they speak English, IN THE COUNTRY WHERE ENGLISH COMES FROM, the ball game is over. The next subway bombing will be blamed on the BNP for their racism and hatred of peace loving, victimized Muslims.</p>

<p>Well, just ask the Muslim. They will tell you it is all about internal struggle and the desire for moral perfection. Nothing more!</p>

		<p>Why do the British police pretend to be horrified by this? Is it because they realize that maybe, Nick Griffin and Mark Collett are telling the TRUTH?</p>
<p>Nah, they have to provide a show for BBC.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;No child is ever too young to be started off on Jihad training&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p>I guess this implies that no muslim kid is too young to be shot by the police or by Western soldiers, either.</p>
<p>It is sad, of course, but if a kid pulls a gun or plans to blow himself up along with a hundred people, that kid is no longer an innocent victim or by-stander&hellip; and has to be dealt with using the necessary force!</p>

		<p>To Anonymous #2 @ 10.54pm:</p>
<p>No such inquiry is necessary.</p>
<p>Since at least the 1960s the state education system in Britain has been completely under the control of Cultural Marxists who have distorted and diluted the curriculum to produce several cohorts of brainwashed ignoramuses who now constitute almost the entire electorate.</p>
<p>A similar cultural revolution has occurred in the mass media which now alternately pump out mind-sapping drivel and tendentious propaganda.</p>
