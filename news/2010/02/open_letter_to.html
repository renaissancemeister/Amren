<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><i>This letter was faxed to US Attorney General Eric Holder, and Oklahoma Senators Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn, Wednesday, February 24, 2010, around 11:30 am, CST:</i></p>
<p>February 24, 2010</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder<br/>
U.S. Department of Justice<br/>
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW<br/>
Washington, DC 20530-0001</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Holder,</p>
<p>My name is David Yeagley. I am a Comanche Indian, from Oklahoma. I wish to report a dramtic and illegal denial of First Amendment rights which occurred in the Washington, DC area, the week of February 15, 2010.</p>
<p>I am sure you are concerned, since a year ago to the day, you declared that America was a nation of cowards because they are afraid to talk about race. I report to you that a group of people attempted to assemble peacefully to discuss race intelligently, and they were harassed, even with death threats, to the point of cancelling their conference  &mdash;  twice.</p>
<p>In a period of less than two weeks, The American Renaissance Conference attempted to procure hotel and meeting space for its members and speakers, and four different hotels cancelled their contracts due to harassment and threats made against their management and their employees.</p>
<p>I was one of the invited speakers at this conference, and I take these events quite seriously. I have presented the matter here as simply and abstractly as possible. I hope that you can see the gravity of the crime. The First Amendment was utterly denied me, and many others.</p>
<p>I appeal to you, because of your special perception of the race subject. I was impressed with your initial candor when you assessed the nation&rsquo;s fear of race. I see this American Renaissance situation as a great opportunity for you to support those who are not afraid. Here a group of respectable people desired to meet together publicly, and to discuss race. They were denied. Opponents were afraid to let anyone talk about race.</p>
<p>Will you prosecute the offending opponents? Will you make good your word, and support the American Renaissance? This is a golden opportunity to do so. You yourself could host them in the future, there at the DOJ, and perhaps even be the keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. David A. Yeagley (enrolled Comanche)<br/>
P.O.Box 75017<br/>
Oklahoma City, OK 73107</p>
<p>CC: Oklahoma Senators Jim Inhofe, Tom Coburn</p>
<p><i>There were telephone calls made, and assurances given that the fax was received. We shall inform our readers the minute we receive any response from any of the offices involved. It is highly unlikely, but, this letter was an initial action taken in defense of the First Amendment. It is not known at this time whether American Renaissance has taken any such action at this point.</i><br/>

		<p>Thank you, David Yeagley. If Native American David Yeagley&rsquo;s civil rights can be denied, along with the voices of White community organizers like Jared Taylor, then there is no longer the rule of law in America. This blatant act of domestic terrorism and racial intimidation needs to be addressed by the authorities and the courts at once.</p>

		<p>The letter writer is right in general but he is dead wrong when he hangs his argument on the First Amendment.  The First Amendment is a limitation on the power of government.  It was not government that prevented Yeagley from speaking.  </p>
<p>What does Yeagley expect the Attorney General to do?  Even a sympathetic AG could do nothing.</p>
<p>The hotels which cancelled AR&rsquo;s meeting may have been in breach of contract, but I suspect not: their contracts probably allow the hotels to cancel for security reasons.</p>
<p>What happened is a travesty, but it is not a First Amendment issue.</p>

		<p>Excellent letter, David Yeagley.  I understand that one of the those doing the harrassing, smearing, and instigating was Jeffery Imm, who some say works for the Department of Homeland Security.  If that is true, then Eric Holder should fire him.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I do not have much faith in Eric Holder.  When he addressed Congress, his view was that whites should not be covered under hate crime laws.</p>

		<p>GB you are way off.  The hotel&rsquo;s management were harrassed and people where threatened.  The government failed to take action to stop it.  This is definitely a First Amendment issue.  If the same tactics were employed against a hotel that hosted a NAACP conference, the FBI would have gotten vigorously involved and so would the media.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not be to quick to judge here.  I understand this letter is an appeal to Holder.  An attack was made on American citizens.  It is in fact his jurisdiction, certainly if anyone is arraigned.  Holder has authority to pursue this, I believe  &mdash;  and morally is obligated to, given his statement about Americans.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that is true.  If the local police refused to address the threats or intimidation, thereby causing the hotels to cancel, I think there might be an argument that the state denied the organizers&rsquo; and attendees&rsquo; constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Failing to protect citizens and businesses from mobs and thugs because the former hold unpopular views, I think, might be some sort of state action.  Though I would have to research the issue to know for sure.</p>

<p>I think you are wrong.  Surely, if some non-white organization were so disrupted the authorities would pursue the malefactors with the greatest vigor.  The disparate response received by AR (in fact, the lack of any significant response), represents selective protection of AR&rsquo;s rights.  Governmental failure to protect AR&rsquo;s speech has a detrimental effect similar to that of active governmental suppression of that same speech.  A good lawyer could put a sharper point on it than I just did, but yes, the incident is indeed a First Amendment issue.</p>

		<p>What I find most disturbing is that not a single white politician will address this assault of freedom of expression nor demand an investigation into the terrorist threats that these &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; made against the hoteliers.  It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be addressed from a racial stand point but merely a legal viewpoint.  </p>
<p>Even sadder still is that not a single white politician, when running for office against an incumbent, will   point out that the Obama administration openly believes that whites should not have equal (or any) civil rights protections.  Holder and Sotomayor both represent the Obama administration (among others) and have both stated their opposition to white civil rights.  If a representative of any executive office holder (president, governor or mayor of a major city) stated that they did not believe that blacks, mexicans, etc. didn&rsquo;t deserve civil rights protections not only would the MSM be all over him or her but so would a candidate running against him.  </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t white politicians appeal to white voters?  Don&rsquo;t make a hoot and holler over the issue, just state the facts.  When the MSM tries to twist things just stay with the facts, such as quotes and film clips of these anti-white racists.  Repeat the truth long enough, loud enough and unapologetically enough and people will begin to believe.</p>

		<p>The leftist don&rsquo;t want to grant anyone who doesn&rsquo;t go with the program any rights what so ever. If you&rsquo;re a minority an decide that the Constitution and Western ideals are the way to go, then you&rsquo;re a sell-out or you&rsquo;re delusional. Anything but a thinking individual. A simple truth of life. Somethings work better than others. Capitalism, constitional republics, natural rights work pretty well most of the time. It won&rsquo;t make a utopia, simply a very workable government for most of the people, most of the time. To para-phase Churchhill, it&rsquo;s the best thing we have thought up so far. Most likely the best we will manage in this world. </p>

		<p>If there has been harassment or death threats, then yes this is a first amendment issue and the authorities need to investigate.</p>
<p>However, when a hotel breaks it&rsquo;s contract, that is not a first amendment issue. I assume they have some sort of escape clause accompanied with a pre-agreed refund. If not, it would be an issue for the civil courts to settle in a breach of contract lawsuit.</p>
<p>If a hotel cancels, BUT it&rsquo;s within the agreement that was signed by both parties&hellip;then there is nothing you can do about it. More to the point, there is nothing that *should* be done about it.</p>
<p>Free speech is not the ultimate right. Property rights are, and all other legitimate rights are subsets of property rights. You have the right to free speech  &mdash;  but not on my front lawn. You have the right to shoot your gun  &mdash;  but not inside my house. You have the right to hire and serve anyone you want, for any reason you want, as long as it&rsquo;s a business you own. (Well okay, the government doesn&rsquo;t recognize that last one anymore, which is why civil rights laws are immoral.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to see a hotel turn down good business, but in the end it&rsquo;s their choice who they associate with.</p>

<p>It may be so but the criminals felt that with a Republican out and Obama and Holder in they are safe.<br/>

		<p>I thank David Yeagley for writing that letter but I am highly doubtful that anything will come of it.  Eric Holder is not going to lift a finger to secure the rights of white race realists to peaceably assemble and speak.  When Eric Holder said that Americans were cowards because they did not discuss race openly the Amren conference isn&rsquo;t what he had in mind.  Rather, he wanted a repetition of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;Dialog on Race&#8221; in which the same tired rituals would be repeated   &mdash;   first, black people talk about how much they suffer from &#8220;racism&#8221;, and then, white people sob and beat their chests, admit that they&rsquo;re terrible racists, and beg forgiveness.</p>
<p>There have been several black nationalist conferences over the years, <a href="http://theblacklistpub.ning.com/profiles/blogs/may-2224-national-black-power" rel="nofollow">including this one.</a>  These conferences have featured Prof. Leonard Jeffries, he of the famous theory that whites are &#8220;ice people&#8221; suffering from a lack of melanin, and various members of the virulently anti-white, anti-Jewish, Nation of Islam.  Never did Jeffrey Imm or any of his Stalinist fellow travelers try to stop those conferences.  They did not harass the employees of the hotels that hosted the conferences and issued no death threats.  They are hypocrites.</p>

<p>How is it not?  You are likely correct that conference facilities have a clause in their contracts to allow cancellations for security concerns and that is fine, but it does not change the fact that intimidation used to force cancellations is a violation of constitutional rights.  As Yeagley posted above, there is even a law expressly stating this:  18 U.S.C. § 241. Conspiracy against rights.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid David Yeagley is deeply confused about what Eric Holder called for.</p>
<p>he called for yet another round of lamenting RACISM, i.e. bad things whites have supposedly done to blacks.</p>
<p>discussions of RACE (i.e., the reality of racial difference) is still forbidden by law in the United States, and Eric Holder is the last person we can expect to change that.</p>
<p>as a recently recovered race denier, I believe that most Americans, including the vast majority of liberals, are aware of the reality of racial differences in character and cognitive ability, but are intimidated into silence by speech codes, censorship, a myriad of institutional structures which make free expression impossible.</p>
<p>if the speech codes were lifted, and people were allowed to express themselves freely, we would discover that most whites are perfectly aware of the racial differences that they loudly and stridently deny in order to protect their jobs, their social standing, their homes.</p>
<p>the goals for establishing basic civil rights for European Americans are quite simple:</p>
<p>1) eliminate all speech codes that contradict the First Amendment. </p>
<p>2) eliminate all racial quotas that contradict universal standards in hiring and education.</p>
<p>3) eliminate an immigration policy designed to turn whites into minority in their own country.</p>
<p>the last reform I recommend a zero-tolerance for black on white crime, including black on white rape in prison, which is by a very wide margin and most important civil rights violation taking place in the United States over the past few decades.</p>
<p>the fact that whites do not talk publicly about the epidemic of black-and-white prison rape means that whites have yet to find their voice when it comes to demanding their civil rights.</p>

		<p>This incident could be a springboard for Amren to achieve what I think should be a short-term goal: establish a set of principles under which racial (or any other discussion) is specifically protected from civil penalty if certain guidelines are followed.  Speech codes in employment and education are deliberately written to be as vague and expansive as possible, to give listeners the broadest possible leeway to claim offense at anything.  I&rsquo;ve never seen one, for instance, that gives counter-examples of statements that are specifically protected from offensiveness claims.  If Eric Holder is serious about wanting to encourage honest racial dialogue, he&rsquo;ll draw up a speech protection code for employers and schools to use, so that a speaker can say &#8220;I did A,B and C, so you can&rsquo;t penalize me because someone doesn&rsquo;t like what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW, other attainable goals I&rsquo;d like us to pursue:<br/>
-&gt;  Establish white advocacy (perhaps under a different name) as a position that merits representation in media commentary, so that the Revs don&rsquo;t go unanswered when they claim that something like Duke Lacrosse exemplifies white privilege<br/>
-&gt;  Start a campaign to encourage economic patriotism.  For instance, my home repair contractor is a family business (father and two sons, wives run the office) that doesn&rsquo;t employ illegal immigrants.  In this economy, this might reverberate even among people who otherwise would have nothing to do with us.</p>

GB you are way off. The hotel&rsquo;s management were harrassed and people where threatened. The government failed to take action to stop it. This is definitely a First Amendment issue. If the same tactics were employed against a hotel that hosted a NAACP conference, the FBI would have gotten vigorously involved and so would the media. </p>
<p><br/>
Anonymous: You are right about everything but the First Amendment.  Harrassment and threats are illegal; the police should have acted; yes, had the NAACP been the victim the FBI would have been on the case like white on rice.  However, nothing here related in the slightest degree to the First Amendment.</p>

True.  The government does not involve itself in every dispute and problem that come along, unless someone ASKS it to do so. There has to be <i><b>a complainant. </b></i> </p>
<p>In some, exceptional, cases (such as minors or the dead) the state becomes the complainant when the victim cannot speak for himself. But, generally speaking, there has to be an aggrieved party who is appealing to the state for justice. If there is no complaint, there is no crime. It is just a private matter between two individuals.  Has Amren appealed?</p>

		<p>I commend Dr. Yeagley for his efforts to bring Eric Holder&rsquo;s attention to this serious civil rights violation.  But I&rsquo;m afraid his efforts will be in vain.  Eric Holder is a warrior for the black race.  Let&rsquo;s take a look at what the Holder Justice Dept. has been doing while we all watch American Idol:</p>
<p>1) Called America a nation of cowards on race; in Holder&rsquo;s view there has been an insufficient amount of self flagellation and mea culpas by whites for our alleged sins against people of color.  We cannot be considered a nation of the brave until whites prostrate themselves before black people and hand over all our wealth and political power.  </p>
<p>2) Will review and address the high incarceration rates among black males Holder believes is due to anti-black bias in the court system. <br/>
Note: Harsh &#8220;hate crime&#8221; sentences meted out to whites for minor offenses and the black on white rape epidemic inside the men&rsquo;s prison system and by black men against white women isn&rsquo;t on Holder&rsquo;s agenda.  </p>
<p>3) Dropped the voter intimidation case against the Black Panthers in spite of overwhelming evidence of their guilt. </p>
<p>4) Ordered the FBI to stop conducting surveillance against the Nation of Islam.  </p>
<p>As you can see our esteemed Attorney General has used his official capacity not uphold the law for the benefit of all Americans, but to advance the black race agenda.  He will continue to do so since the vast majority of blacks are utterly incapable of altruism towards whites.</p>
<p>In an America increasingly dominated by non-whites, there will be no justice for whites.       </p>

		<p>The letter is spot-on. This is a First Amendment issue, and the antifas did violate the law. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple: if someone uses violence or threats, or masks himself or herself, alone or in concert with others, to prevent someone from exercising their rights, they have committed a crime. </p>
<p>Well, the antifas masked themselves. They telephoned threats to the hotels. The hotels cancelled the contracts, for that reason. The right of Amren-ers to have a peaceable assembly was violated. The law was broken, and Holder is the nation&rsquo;s top law officer. </p>

		<p>I agree with those like 6, 10 and 13. This definitely is a freedom of speech issue and should be actionable in the courts. If nobody has suggested it (I have not read all the posts), AR must report this to the local FBI (not Holder to start) and have them investigate. If the FBI and Holder ultimately suppress this case, it should be brought to the courts. Or, start with a lawsuit right away. A good constitutional lawyer should know what to do. Even the Attorney General cannot override decisions of the courts, never mind the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court may want to get their hands on an issue like this, at least those other than the card-carriers on the left of the bench. The AR conference case is made for litigation, and would be an excellent way to get suppression of free speech by the Left out in the open where the public can look at it in all its ugliness. </p>

		<p>Judging by Holder&rsquo;s decisions 43 Super Dave, I would be inclined to call Holder a black racist. At the same time, putting public pressure on him to take up the AR case through the FBI or in the courts will only expose him further and potentially antagonize the majority of Americans, which could put pressure on Obama to do something about him and the AR case. This is a golden opportunity to force people in power to show their true colors, and should IMO be pushed through legal and media channels.</p>

A:  The fact that an action violates federal law does not make it a violation of the First Amendment.  This is not a sophisticated point.  Read the Amendment and some commentary about it.
