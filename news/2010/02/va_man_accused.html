<h1>Va. Man Accused of Helping Smuggle Somalis Into U.S.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Freeman Klopott, Washington Examiner, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Authorities are searching for 270 Somalis believed to have entered the U.S. illegally with the help of a Virginia man who admitted contacts with an Islamic terrorist group.</p>
<p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent said his agency had yet to locate any of the suspected illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit filed in Alexandria&rsquo;s federal court, Anthony Joseph Tracy told authorities that he came in contact with the Somali terrorist organization Al-Shabaab, which announced an alliance with al Qaeda earlier this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an e-mail, Tracy reportedly wrote, &#8220;i helped alot of somalis and most are good but there are some who are bad and i leave them to ALLAH,&#8221; the affidavit said.</p>
<p>He has been held without bail. Tracy&rsquo;s attorney, Geremy Kamens, declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eyre [ICE Agent Thomas Eyre] indicated authorities are trying to find the Somalis and determine whether they&rsquo;re associated with Al-Shabaab. An ICE spokeswoman said she could not comment on an ongoing investigation. The Somalis are believed to have entered the United States through the border with Mexico after making a circuitous trip from Kenya to Dubai to Moscow to Cuba to South America to Mexico and then the U.S., Eyre testified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tracy, who moved to Kenya in April from Winchester, is accused of helping the Somalis move to the United States by getting them travel visas to Cuba through contacts he had at the Cuban Embassy, court documents said. The visas were issued using fraudulent information Tracy allegedly provided his contacts. Authorities say Tracy knew that the U.S. was the Somalis&rsquo; intended final destination.<br>

		<p>Due to illegal immigration and easy legal immigration, we are headed toward a big, massive, momentous calamity in this country, and thanks to the newly aroused white middle class who have been awakened by Obama and the rabble rousers on FoxNews and the internet, the pieces will be put back together on less insane basis than our current forms.</p>
<p>Tribalism is nature&rsquo;s way, and artificial governmental impediments to tribalism will fall once the inevitable spreads far enough.<br>

		<p>Remember when Somalis were welcomed into Maine a while back and the politicians heavily criticized those of us who maintained that their crime and chaos problem would increase and accelerate as never before?</p>
<p>Well, it appears, we didn&rsquo;t know the whole truth ourselves, because the Somali gangs are causing far more problems than expected and there are those who are transitioning back and forth to Muslim training areas to take jihadist training.</p>
<p>To the police chief of one Maine town who told his criticizers to butt out:  &#8220;How do you like your town now, chief?  Think it will get worse?</p>

		<p>Pity our government officials are like the proverbial Ostriches&hellip; only difference being the ostriches are supposed to have their heads buried in the sand. Government officials have their heads buried in a place best not mentioned. </p>
