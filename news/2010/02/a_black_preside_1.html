<h1><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/id/233161">A Black President Before a Black &#8216;Bachelor&rsquo;?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joshua Alston, Newsweek, February,5 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} But as I watch the remaining women vie for Jake&rsquo;s hand in marriage [Jake Pavelka is the star of this season of The Bachelor, a show I&rsquo;m watching for the first time and am absorbed in], I can&rsquo;t help but think: Why are all of these people white? In fact, in the 14-season history of the show, all of the bachelors have been white, along with a staggering majority of the women available to him.</p>
<p>My first inclination was to call the show&rsquo;s executive producer and ask. But then I thought better of it. Why waste time with a crafted, politically correct explanation when I already know the answer? People still overwhelmingly date and marry within their own race. White people are the majority in this country and, therefore, the best audience to target from a ratings standpoint, and there&rsquo;s risk in alienating viewers who may have less enlightened views on interracial couples. {snip} The Bachelor is one of many pop-culture artifacts that highlight the uncomfortable gap between the way we&rsquo;d like to think of racial integration and the way it actually is. Just as people of different races don&rsquo;t often date each other or worship together, we also don&rsquo;t read many of the same books, or like many of the same movies, or adore many of the same celebrities. {snip}</p>
<p>Periodically, controversies arise when people are forced to confront this dissonance. Vanity Fair just released its Hollywood issue, and gracing its cover are nine rising starlets, all of them wispy, white women. {snip} Vanity Fair, like The Bachelor, didn&rsquo;t create the disparity, they just committed it to film. That&rsquo;s not to say we shouldn&rsquo;t strive for progress whenever possible. J. J. Abrams, to his credit, cast Boris Kodjoe and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the male and female leads for his new NBC thriller Undercovers, a bold choice considering both are black, neither are household names, and the characters (married spies) don&rsquo;t necessarily call for black actors. But it&rsquo;s an experiment to say the least.</p>
<p>People of different races talk over each other&rsquo;s heads all the time: {snip} The truth is, it&rsquo;s disturbing how divided we still are in some respects, so we convince ourselves these divisions don&rsquo;t exist, then bristle when we&rsquo;re reminded otherwise. It&rsquo;s a goal for America to reach a point at which people of different races are integrated in every facet of life; we&rsquo;ll date each other, worship together, and judge movies based not on the color of their characters&rsquo; skin but on the content of their characters&rsquo; characters. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll just have to grin and bear it when reminded that we&rsquo;re not quite there yet. {snip}<br>

		<p>We all know why there will not be a black Bachelor.</p>
<p>Much like Tiger Woods (et al) he will pick white women over black women. </p>
<p>And black women hate (and know) this even more than white people.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true, anymore. I have seen White women with Black men quite a few times.</p>
<p>And today&rsquo;s young Whites listen to hip-hop, dress like rappers&hellip; even try to talk like they are from some ghetto, while in fact they were raised in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Couch potatoes from every race like to watch Black pro basketball players in action&hellip;</p>
<p>Like it or not, the flavor of American popular culture is a lot more African-American than it is English, or Irish, or Italian&hellip;</p>
<p>Blacks have an enormous influence, for a minority group, in the United States.</p>

		<p>The fact is that While the majority of Americans still date and marry within thier own race, a growing number are dating and marrying across racial lines. This is particulaly true in the number of White/Asian couples and marriages.</p>

		<p>The writer discusses the ABC program, The Bachelor. However, I wonder if there is a more class element taking place here. What I mean is that I would say that it is safe to say that the majority of people who watch the bachelor are upper middle class, well-educated professionals. These people tend to be majority White.</p>
<p>Thus it would only make sense that the couples and bachelors selected for the program would be White and dwell educated for that matter. I doubt if too many high school educated White people watch The Bachelor for that matter.</p>

		<p>Yes indeed.  The producers are aware that interracial relationships don&rsquo;t sell, as typically, the only people who are really excited about them are the people in them.  In most cases, the families are disappointed, if only inwardly.  The more obviously they push this on us, the more repugnant it will become to the average person.</p>

		<p>Well, it seems that Joshua Alston is capable of taking one step forward&hellip;:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;People still overwhelmingly date and marry within their own race. White people are the majority in this country&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&hellip;but then feels the need to dance several quick politically-correct steps back to atone for such apostasy.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;there&rsquo;s risk in alienating viewers who may have less enlightened views on interracial couples.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Enlightened&#8221; is one of those prog/liberal code words that translates to &#8220;toeing the multicultural party line.&#8221;  Only by singing the praises of Diversity to the heavens can one become &#8220;Enlightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221;&hellip;  Well, I don&rsquo;t watch television, so I really have no idea what it takes to get Joshua &#8220;absorbed.&#8221;  But when I see names such as &#8220;Boris Kodjoe&#8221; and &#8220;Gugu Mbatha-Raw&#8221; held up as examples of splendid casting, I can pretty well draw my own conclusions.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The truth is, it&rsquo;s disturbing how divided we still are in some respects, so we convince ourselves these divisions don&rsquo;t exist, then bristle when we&rsquo;re reminded otherwise.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, Joshua, the <i>truth</i> is that it&rsquo;s perfectly natural that we are divided along racial lines, so the radical elites in government and media try to convince us that those divisions don&rsquo;t exist.  And we bristle when governmedia apparatchiks like yourself try to brainwash us into believing otherwise.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;who may have less enlightened views on interracial couples.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Medieval times, those who knew the Earth was not flat were &#8220;enlightened&#8221;.  A hundred and fifty years ago, those who knew that germs caused disease were &#8220;enlightened&#8221;.  Going with the flow and swallowing whatever propaganda the powers that be throw at you does not make you &#8220;enlightened&#8221;.  It means you&rsquo;re no better than an amoeba when it comes to thinking for yourself.  These days, interracial coupling is shoved down our throats 24/7 and 365 days in the year.  The ignorant masses see nothing wrong with it because they lack the knowledge to judge it objectively and they have no inclination to gain such knowledge; it&rsquo;s easier to watch sports on T.V. or their favorite sitcom.  The few who can see past such massive brainwashing, those are the ones who are enlightened.</p>

		<p>I am sure I do not understand&hellip;..because I have never heard anyone say&hellip;..why complete racial integration is desirable, or that it is a social goal, or what possible benefits there might be to such a change.</p>
<p>If the purpose of integration is to blend all races together, such that there are no white people or black people or asian people&hellip;then we end up (in time) with an complete blend, by way of cross-breeding and interracial sex, which may have few or none of the traits of any existing race, but may have all of the dominant genetic traits, i.e. brown eyes are genetically dominant over blue, black hair is genetically dominant over blonde, and etc. In such a case, human intelligence, creativity, innovation, and technical capacity would decline significantly. Such traits are already scarce but could easily become non-existant in the human race&hellip;..much to the loss of the rest of the world that depends on them.<br>

<p>First of all, I always wondered men would watch this show, but OK, whatever.  I find it odd that race would enter into his mind while watching a &#8220;reality&#8221; show, which despite its poplularity, is blantantly shallow and will never amount to classic TV.  The Bachelor is hardly an accurate reflection of society and behavior, it&rsquo;s just a fun show; if he&rsquo;s basing his sociological theory on it, he&rsquo;s just a big baby looking for some excuse to complain.  </p>
<p>The author can easily appease himself by turing on BET and wondering where all the White people are .  </p>

<p>It is simply and delightfully astonishing to see a black like this Comrade Alston, make the usual moron of himself when it comes to the issue of miscegenation &ldquo;not&rdquo; being promoted in the mass media. </p>
<p>Quite to the contrary there Comrade Alston, starting with the horrendously malevolent &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; media and finally infecting our sociopolitical culture, the genocidal patterns of voluntary white and nonwhite sexual &ldquo;integration&rdquo; have probably reached a zenith. What more could you possibly want in a country&rsquo;s medium that now promotes this racially destructive horror as &ldquo;positive&rdquo; in about 75% to 90% of what is produced by it?</p>
<p>Must they actually start openly advocating for a legally enforced &ldquo;reproductive integration&rdquo; of all whites with nonwhites, to satisfy you mental anguishes on the topic?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>I *really* wish that blacks and their minions in the liberal elite would stop trying to foist this on everyone! People are getting really sick and tired of it. Last time I checked, we all the right to free association and nobody was obligated to have a certain amount of black friends, a black fiancee or go to a black church! To try and force this on everyone by calling it a &#8220;goal&#8221; is extremely Orwellian! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the author is entirely correct. Many young viewers have been so brainwashed that they would watch a race-mixing &#8220;Bachelor&#8221; without batting an eyelash. Mainly older viewers might be offended. </p>
<p>A friend of mine just came back from the U.K. and says that things are much worse over there. Miscegnation is promoted everywhere. </p>

		<p>Newsweek is becoming as politically correct as MSNBC.  I saw one of their editors on Fox news recently and he was asked why his magazine pushed political correctness over the truth.  He didn&rsquo;t have a clue.  According to him, he was the epitome of fair and balanced.  In the next breath he called the tea party movement &#8220;tea baggers&#8221; and haters.  Amazing.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s we?  What makes you think people idealize racial integration the way you&rsquo;d like them to?  For most Whites, racial integration means putting up with a few tokens at work or worse putting up with a black neighbor in a White neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as people of different races don&rsquo;t often date each other or worship together,&#8221;</p>
<p>Most White people are uncomfortable sitting in a church where the pastor is taking the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain when talking about White America while the congregation is screaming &#8220;can I get a witness&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;we also don&rsquo;t read many of the same books,&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t read any books at all. </p>
<p>&#8220;or like many of the same movies, or adore many of the same celebrities. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, &#8220;House Party&#8221;, &#8220;Stomp the Yard&#8221; and &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221; were such classics.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a goal for America to reach a point at which people of different races are integrated in every facet of life; we&rsquo;ll date each other, worship together, and judge movies based not on the color of their characters&rsquo; skin but on the content of their characters&rsquo; characters.

		<p>Yet another media guilt-fest for Whites.  Now you are supposed to feel guilty because an idiotic &#8220;reality&#8221; show doesn&rsquo;t conform to the heroic mandates of PC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time for American Whites to start rejecting the constant deluge of guilt.  As a distinct ethnic group, we have the RIGHT to seek to continue our existence, and the corresponding right to abhor and discourage interracial marriage and mixing.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago the media was weeping because the last member of a particular ethnic group had passed away on a remote island.  If her existence as a distinct ethnic had value and meaning, so does our own.</p>
<p>We owe no one an apology for seeking to perpetuate our people and nations.  The very idea that we should feel guilt for doing so, is absolutely absurd.</p>

		<p>Seems like J Alston is a House Afro at Newsweek. Personally I never watched the show he speaks of but I am aware of several shows on Cable channels that feature Bruthas and the white women who love them. Anyone seen the disaster of the Kardashian show where two of the offspring are exclusively enamored with Afro dudes? Or the Kendra/Playboy Spinoff? Or several other VH1/MTV shows (Ray J or some such among them) that feature da bros? </p>
<p>I guess Mr. Alston just wants TV to be all a parade of so-called diversity.</p>

<p>The men who watch that kind of show are much more likely to be liberal automatons, if not gay.</p>
<p>White women are the show&rsquo;s biggest demographic, and while some of their trashier or more brainwashed sisters might be titillated by a black bachelor, the majority would not be, even if they&rsquo;d be afraid to say so. But the show&rsquo;s producers know this and that they&rsquo;d change the channel if they did have interracial coupling, so they have only white bachelors.</p>

		<p> When you boil down all this slumgullion that Mr. Alston wrote above, what it amounts to is: Thank God that eventually we&rsquo;ll start miscegenating on a massive scale, so all these awful White people will gradually disappear from the earth. That&rsquo;s his bottom line, folks. All else is mere commentary. He gave his game away in the penultimate paragraph of the original story.</p>

<p>I agree with you. The majority of Whites, Blacks and others under 45 would not bat one eyelash if their were a Black or Hispanic bachelor and a White contestants or vice versa.</p>
<p>Anonymous 6:50pm:</p>
<p>The fact is as much as I hate to admit it, it is not Blacks that are driving multiculturalism down our throats. Quite frankly, Blacks 55 and older, like many Whites of the same age group, are very suspicious of multiculturalism and diversity. While they may not overtly criticize it, they certainly do not embrace it.</p>
<p>It is the White liberals and neo-cons, under the guise of being &#8220;real&#8221; conservatives that are promoting this sick, perverse agenda. That is where our disgust should lie.</p>

<p> I watch the Bachelor and The Bachelorette and once they start mixing the races in those shows that is the end for me. I will NOT have any multiculturalism shoved down my throat any longer! </p>
<p>I truly believe most Whites instinctively know deep inside that this is not natural or desirable. It is repulsive to me and it should be. Whites for the most part, have lost all their NORMAL God-given instincts for their own survival and it is absolutely appalling to me. On every channel all we see is race mixing and even in the commercials, doesn&rsquo;t that tell us this is also a deliberate agenda to destroy our race? </p>

		<p>I agree with Confederate Lady but why not have an all black episode on The Bachelor once in a while. Why should it be restricted to BET? I think this would make for great entertainment but might not qualify as a legitimate &#8220;reality show&#8221; since true love between two blacks rarely happens.</p>
<p>An occasional all black show would more like Springer or Povich than The Bachelor therefore it musn&rsquo;t happen since it wouldn&rsquo;t be PC. Amren readers could band together and petition this show to be more racially balanced so everyone could see the sad reality for themselves.</p>

		<p>This sentiment was expressed by jewamongyou, but I want to reiterate the point that embracing interracial marriage and &#8220;diversity&#8221; (translation: non-whiteness) does not make a white person &#8220;enlightened.&#8221; When I was a foolish and ignorant high school student, I was a self-hating white person who wished he were non-white, supported interracial couples, and cherished &#8220;diversity.&#8221; That didn&rsquo;t make me an intelligent or critical thinker. I was simply believing what various teachers, media pundits, and others wanted me to believe. </p>
<p>On another note, I am furious every time I hear non-whites constantly demanding that we be more &#8220;inclusive&#8221; and feature more &#8220;diversity&#8221; in our shows, movies, magazines, etc. Rather than constantly demanding that we include them in our realm, they should be creating films, magazines, and shows of their own. Oh, wait, they already do that! I guess we&rsquo;re simply not allowed to have anything to ourselves anymore. For once, I would love to see an all white movie, show, or magazine, without token non-whites thrown in. </p>
<p>Seriously, blacks have an annual GDP of almost 1 trillion dollars. They, and other non-whites, can create their own films, shows, and magazines that cater solely to them. They don&rsquo;t need to be included in our world, nor should they be. If they are tired of the &#8220;insensitivity&#8221; of white directors, producers, or authors, they don&rsquo;t have to like or watch such entertainment. I&rsquo;m sick of them inviting themselves to all of our institutions.</p>
<p>I am also sick of whites who tolerate and support such non-white sentiments!</p>

Considering black people (esp. males) commit themselves to holy matrimony less than any other ethnic group, BET probably couldn&rsquo;t find enough black contestants interested in being married. Marriage and monogamy are (as Chris Rock said about blacks and books) like Kryptonite to these people. </p>
<p>I imagine BET would do much better in the ratings with a show about a footloose brotha whose goal is to seduce and impregnate as many females as possible without committing to ANY of them. The winner would be the contestant who got the most sex for the least effort. </p>

<p>I know discussing the Jewish factor is not addressed by Amren, which is fine, but David Duke is 100% right about this issue, like it or not.  Think about it, there is a reason the assault on European civilization is occurring simultaneously in the US, Europe, Canada &amp; Australia.  Race-mixing is the just one of the symptoms of the greater disease.  Until we address the core of the problem, we&rsquo;ll get nowhere as a people.  Is it just a coincidence that ABC and other networks are run by Jews and push this 24/7 diversity down our throats?  I think not.</p>

<p>The dominant culture in this country promoted by the government and by the media exalts &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; above all else. In these ideologies, assimilation and integration is no longer a goal, no longer an ideal that we seek as a society. Every minority group is encouraged to MAINTAIN its identity, lobby for its own special interests and grab whatever special rights and benefits it can get. </p>
<p>On the other hand, when it comes to white people&hellip; the old sixties ideal of integration is very much still in place. Integration is only desirable when it comes to compelling white people to &#8220;open up&#8221; their culture to minorities. In fact, according to this article, white people are morally obligated to integrate at the most basic, essential level i.e. interracial marrying. </p>
<p>In other words, its fine for minority groups to maintain their identities, to not integrate, to stay as separate as they can&hellip; but not for whites. Not only are whites not supposed to lobby for their own interests in a racially conscious way (that would be &#8220;racist,&#8221; after all), whites are supposed to want to see themselves literally bred out of existence.</p>

<p> All I know is that my WHITE husband satisfies me in every way and I would never ever consider dating any other race.

		<p>There are some positive things about interracial dating and marriage in that cross breeding leads to a more docile black with certain aggressive traits bred out of them similar to the African Honeybee experiment.  White women who actually are married to black men will have one or at the most two black children compared to that same black man if he had married a black woman or shacked up with one for a time, there would be four or five.  There are alot of studies that show mixed race children are generally less mentally balanced than other children.  There are high rates of schizophrenia, depression, homosexuality and other factors that lead many of them to live solitary lives, incapable of forming relationships or raising families.  In theory, all of these factors should result in every successive generation being smaller than the previous and not being burdened with all those undesirable traits found in blacks. </p>

&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an answer: something about &ldquo;size does matter&rdquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a measly quarter of an inch&hellip;.</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m sure this is a conversation most of us would prefer not to have, but when the subject of interracial dating comes up it&rsquo;s hard to avoid. FWIW, the Kinsey Report* in late 1940s found a SLIGHT difference in size: less than 1/2&#8221; additional, when at full length. (What previous poster QD says about &#8220;when at rest&#8221; may well be true also, throwing off our perceptions.) </p>
<p>In any case, not a huge deal. Not really enough of an advantage for a white woman to take all the risks of &#8220;dating black&#8221; for, in my opinion. But apparently a lot of white women these days disagree with me. </p>
<p><br>
* Keep in mind however that this is the same Report that estimated the homosexual population at a whopping 10% (current thinking says more like 4% - 5%), so always take your Kinsey data with the recommended dose of salt. </p>

		<p><i>Newsweek</i> has spent the last 50 years covering up racist violence on a massive scale against whites.  They&rsquo;ve completely ignored  the ethnic cleansing of whites from most major American cities.  Every time a Newsweek gives us one of these prissy little lectures on race they should have to answer questions about their role in what amounts to helping to sponsor mass-murder and rape.  That&rsquo;s the only counter to this sort of propaganda.   They can&rsquo;t provide a decent answer because they haven&rsquo;t acted decently,  they can only suppress debate on their activities,  and punching through that barrier of silence will go a long way toward knocking the self-assumed moral sheen off the left and exposing them as the genocidal evil that they actually are. </p>
<p>You cam bet almost all of the staff at Newsweek lives in areas of New York that by modern standards pass as segregated,  and sent their kids to neo-segregated private schools.   &#8220;Sometimes our pop-culture universes overlap.&#8221;  Sometimes indeed.   Race lecturers should be harried constantly over their personal hypocrisies.  The <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> should be skewered over the racial make-up of their staff every time they give a lecture on race.  Their lapdogs at &#8220;conservative&#8221; publications should get it as well - they collaborate in murderous racism against middle and lower class whites because doing so allows them to live a neo-segregated lifestyle in peace.  It&rsquo;s a sort of &#8220;Gentleman&rsquo;s Agreement.&#8221;  The only place a future anthropologist will read less about anti-white violence than in the archives of the <i>Washington Post</i> is in the archives of <i>The National Review</i>.</p>
