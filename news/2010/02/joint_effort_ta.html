			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sebastian Rotella, Los Angeles Times, February 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a politically sensitive operation at the Arizona- Mexico border, U.S. Border Patrol agents and Mexican federal police officers are training together, sharing intelligence and coordinating patrols for the first time.</p>
<p>The goal of the historic partnership: a systematic joint attack on northbound flows of drugs and migrants, and southbound shipments of guns and cash. It is part of a major, unannounced crackdown started in recent months involving hundreds of U.S. and Mexican officers in the border&rsquo;s busiest smuggling corridor.</p>
<p>The initiative appears likely to expand. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Mexican Public Safety Secretary Genaro Garcia Luna will sign a declaration Thursday in Mexico City agreeing to replicate the experiment. Eventually, officials say, joint operations borderwide could lead to the creation of a Mexican force serving as a counterpart to the Border Patrol  &mdash;  an agency once regarded with nationalistic aversion in Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the unprecedented effort faces imposing obstacles: violent drug cartels, long-standing Mexican reluctance to interfere with illegal immigration into the United States and a legacy of corruption that has scuttled past enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s so much potential for corruption,&#8221; said Jennifer Allen, executive director of the Border Action Network, a migrant advocate group in Arizona. &#8220;It could be destined for failure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right now law enforcement in Mexico cannot compete with the trafficking networks. It can&rsquo;t compete with the money, the power.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Trevino watched a training session in which green-uniformed U.S. instructors shouted directions as nine Mexican officers in blue uniforms, goggles and helmets roared through mud and water on all-terrain vehicles that the Border Patrol uses to chase border-crossers.</p>
<p>Mexican officers, who undergo U.S. background checks, also train in close-quarters firearms techniques and medical rescue skills. The Border Patrol plans to vet and train several hundred Mexican federal officers who also will learn behavioral analysis and ways to detect contraband concealed in vehicles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Trevino said that while his officers aggressively pursue smugglers, they do not intend to interfere with Mexicans crossing north illegally if there is no evidence of other criminal activity. The policy is dictated by longtime Mexican political sensitivity and public opinion, experts say.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan praised the Arizona-Sonora model as part of an enforcement &#8220;sea change&#8221; resulting from government cooperation and the rising frequency of drug traffickers who also smuggle people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Border Patrol officials say the Mexican anti-smuggling effort helps disrupt the flow of illegal migrants and is the most they can hope for at the present time. Smugglers have retaliated against the five-month U.S. crackdown, dubbed the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats.</p>

		<p>I lived in Oaxaca, Mexico for three years; and, along the US-Mexico border for longer than that.  Mexico lies.  It`s corruption knows no bounds.  Remember &#8220;Los Zetas&#8221;? - the US &amp; internationally trained, paramilitary-force that is now in the employment of the cartels.  </p>
<p>The US border patrol is already corrupt and compromised.  I know that the Hispanics don`t like to see &#8220;thier people&#8221; being deported from the US, or is it really America anymore?  I`ve seen White partition, Hispanic militarism, and a &#8220;balkanization&#8221; occour before my very eyes.  </p>
<p>There`s a word for those self-loathing-Whites that choose to live with them-surrounded.</p>

		<p>As a CBP (Customs and Border Protection) officer I witness from the classified records that out of the the number of officers got caught, prosecuted and convicted for crime at the border 87 percent are of Latino origin.  <br>
Privately I know that among the Latino officers at the Southern border the number of law breaking officers is 100 percent.</p>
<p>Does the DHS know that? Of course they know and 100 percent as well.</p>
<p>You simply look at the posh houses they own and the posh cars they drive. </p>

		<p>#3/ Felipe nailed it. The U.S. government has never used the Border Patrol effectively. They are more likely to put every possible obstacle in the way of effective immigration enforcement. As for &#8220;cooperation&#8221; with the federales, they are and have always been notoriously corrupt. I&rsquo;ll grant there are a few exceptions, but those exceptions are rare, and live in mortal danger from their coworkers. Training them in smuggling interdiction would be like giving sensitivity training  classes to the Gestapo.</p>

		<p>Typical liberal nonsense.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next? Outsourcing US anti-nuclear defense to China and North Korea?</p>
<p>How about appointing al-Qaida experts to head US counter-terrorism operatinons?</p>
<p>One needs to remember that liberalism is a mental defect. It shows in many aspects of human endeavour, not just in social engineering.<br>

		<p> Si Si! we will help with immigration for you gringos! It just creates another income stream for us. Who will be the best paid federales? Why the ones who can direct the gringos to their enemies routes while misdirecting them from their compadres routes. This is so obvious as to be laughable. I noticed that they are finally (about time!) admitting that a ton of drugs are being carried in small amounts by the illegals. The math is simple just take 8 ozs. and multiply by 500 and you have a misdemenor marijuana bust and then go to the collection center and you have bales of marijuana for the american consumer.</p>

		<p>All it takes is one ear to leak intel from within this idiotic partnership on where the strengths and weaknesses lie on our side. Who is the imbecile who came up with up this idea? The Mexicans cannot be trusted to police their own and we sure as h*ll don&rsquo;t want them on this side of the Rio Grande&hellip;what we need is a minefield that runs the length of the border, a no-man&rsquo;s land between us and Mexico.</p>

		<p>If the BP officer has a Mexican name; you can pretty well assume he&rsquo;s already on the take. Considering the many Latino Border Patrol types who have been charged with corruption   &mdash;   whether turning a blind eye to drug smuggling or illegal immigrant smuggling or even illegals crossing into our country&hellip; you can take the corruption of Latino BP officers as a given.</p>

		<p>One rotten apple will spoil the whole bunch and Mexico&rsquo;s degenerate culture is based entirely upon a society of rotten apples.  </p>
<p>Just look at how Mexican illegals have already corrupted the majority of American businesses large and small by their willingness to work off the books and for less than the minimum wage.</p>
<p>These lawles people are a major detriment to our future and must be excised from our society post haste&hellip; </p>

		<p>Sixty percent of the new recruits in the BP academy are now Latinos. In a few years, after retirement of white agents in senior positions, the BP will reflect this disastrous percentage up and down the ranks.  </p>
<p>There always was concern that gang members were joining the BP to become insiders so they could direct dopers and human smugglers to the best areas to cross&hellip;.for a bribe of course and a cut of the take. </p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even take into account favoritism for Mexican blood brothers and family that an agency loaded with Latinos will have.  </p>
<p>To openly invite invaders to become a part of BP operations is insanity, but so is the direction and drift that BP has taken in the last few years.     </p>
<p>You can bet that many wantabe Johnny Suttons and the Mexican consultants will be using these Mexican agents as informants to spy on discourteous conduct BP guards might show to an illegal alien. </p>
<p>The decline of the BP began with the creation of the DHS and the merger of the useless US Customs &#8220;Service&#8221; with immigration.   </p>

		<p>Mexico&rsquo;s CULTURE is one of greed, corruption and crime. Only last week NPR Radio informed us the sale of counterfit copies of music, DVD films, knock-offs of designer clothing and other copies of consumer goods amount to some $75 to $80 BILLION A YEAR! Mexican officials should have the honesty to put signs at their airports and border entry points reading: &#8220;WELCOME TO MEXICO, LAND OF THIEVES!&#8221;</p>
