			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Norfolk Examiner (Virginia), February 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On April 17, 2009, the Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay $3.75 million, plus an additional $900,000 in medical expenses to an illegal alien who was severely beaten by other inmates in the Orange County Central Jail. The Mexican national filed a lawsuit shortly after the incident.</p>
<p>Fernando Ramirez, 24, was in jail after being charged with molesting a 6-year-old girl at a local park. He eventually pled guilty to the lesser charge of battery against a child.</p>
<p>According to his attorney, Ramirez suffered brain damage and now needs help walking. Attorney Mark Eisenberg also claims that his client has been left with an intellect of a 4-year-old child.</p>
<p>Despite the dire financial crisis facing Orange County, Ramirez received the largest settlement ever awarded by the county for an in-custody incident. The Board of Supervisors made their decision in a closed-door session and have since refused any comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Except for one story carried by the Orange County Register, there has been no press coverage of this matter. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the only such case which will make your blood boil.</p>
<p>A 2008 New York Times article told the incredible story of a1999 Florida car crash which left Guatemalan national Luis Alberto Jimenez&rsquo;s with severe and permanent physical and mental injuries. After spending more than $1 million on Jimenez&rsquo;s treatment, and failed attempts to secure assistance from the government of Guatemala, the Florida hospital eventually paid to fly Jimenez back to his own country.</p>
<p>The incredible part of the story .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jimenez [has] sued the Florida hospital, which he claimed &#8220;falsely imprisoned&#8221; him and deported him against his will, to avoid any more unpaid medical bills.</p>
<p>Last year, a jury sided with the hospital and Jimenez&rsquo;s lawsuit was dismissed.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most outrageous example of an illegal alien attempting to use the U.S. legal system as another way of stealing from the American people, came from convicted Mexican drug smuggler Osvalda Aldrete-Davila who was shot by Border Patrol Agent Jose Compean in 2005.</p>
<p>After receiving more than $30,000 worth of medical treatment at a U.S. Army facility for the bullet wound in his rear end, he sued the U.S. Border Patrol for $5 million, claiming that Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean violated his civil rights.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. government has been very tight-lipped about the lawsuit, but it appears that the suit was actually settled for an undisclosed amount, and the case has been sealed.</p>

		<p>Any man who molests, sexually assaults or rapes a 6-year-old girl deserves to be castrated. He got off lightly with jail time and a good beating. And he had the audacity to actually sue the government? Even more outrageous was the fact that he won more money than most people will ever see in their life-times.</p>
<p>I doubt the illegal alien was left with the mental faculties of a 4-year-old. If that&rsquo;s true, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the mind to sue.</p>

		<p>Each time I think this whole mess could not get more insane, it does. How does this government and the courts live with themselves? Seems they&rsquo;re afraid that if we don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t grovel to illegals and to the corrupt country of Mexico (the 11th wealthiest country) they might stop sending their illegal. Does anyone know of a nice, safe illegal-free island that Americans can go to and not ever hear about the beauty of diversity or how great multiculturalism is?</p>

		<p>Local governments can only afford to pay out a finite number of these lawsuits. Perhaps going bankrupt might wake some people up, but I doubt it. </p>

		<p>There was an even more outrageous case in that some illegal alien(s) walked through someone&rsquo;s property near the border.  The owners shot at them, I think.  The illegal aliens sued and were awarded that American&rsquo;s property.  Maybe someone here can hunt down the details.  </p>

		<p>What happened to our compadres, Border Agents Ramos and Compean? How about Texas Sherriff Gilmer Hernandez?<br>
These were Mexican American cops who had to use their weapons against hostile illegals who were trying to KILL THEM. THEY were prosecuted. (Ramos &amp; Compean got railroaded, but I hoped they&rsquo;d get out of jail. I&rsquo;m not sure what came of Hernandez.<br>
We owe them our support.<br>
I&rsquo;d shake their hands any day. </p>

		<p>There is nothing to worry about here.  The good white lawyers, and unbiased white judges along with the incorruptible white court reporters will make most of the money on these cases and the poor innocent illegals will get almost nothing.  Ha ha ha</p>

		<p>Liberal Thinking&hellip; isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how it gave Americans all that multi-cultural diversity. Flooding us with 30-35 million Latinos. Another million or so equally, if not more primitive, African refugees. And so on and on.</p>

		<p>American insanity at it&rsquo;s best. Reward the illegal and his crime&hellip;..wonder if any White inmates ever got to sue for the beatings and rapes they have had to endure while locked up? DEPORT ALL illegals now!</p>

		<p>Part of the problem with the jail beat-down story is that any agency that locks someone up is INSTANTLY responsible for that person&rsquo;s physical safety.  If county governments do not want to pay this sort of claim, they need to hire deputies and jail staff who are capable of better work in classifying inmates.  A child-molestation suspect in most jails is instantly shunted to &#8220;administrative segregation&#8221; (solitary) for his own safety.  What were they thinking when they placed this Ramirez creep in general population?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for Orange County at all.  The taxpayers there need to elect a better sheriff and a better county government, or continue to pay settlements like this one.</p>

<p>Forget the illegals, deport the Orange County Board of Supervisors!</p>
<p>The illegals aren&rsquo;t really the problem - they&rsquo;re the product of the problem.  The problem is white folks luring them to the U.S. for cheap labor, the white politicians rewarding them with citizenship, and the white stockholders who only care about prices and nothing about race and nation, among many, many other &#8220;white problems!!!&#8221;<br>

		<p>I agree with #1 about the castration thing - lop &#8216;em off!  But in these cases, the other illegals who have conservatorship rights over the injured person do the suing, because they&rsquo;ll reap the benefit of the fat settlement.  The injured party can be as dumb as a post and it won&rsquo;t matter - his buddies will take care of the lawsuit, with the complete and total cooperation of the bilingual lawyers who will leap at the chance to earn at least 33% of the judgment&hellip;.(I was a legal secretary in one of my former lives!)  It&rsquo;s a complete screw job of the American people going under the false name of justice.</p>

		<p>The article said that he now had the intelligence of a 4 year old.  </p>
<p>I would like some clarification:  Is that an improvement or not over the intelligence he had before he went to jail?</p>
<p>Seriously though, at what point are we going to be able to stop this nonsense of paying people for damages, when they shouldn&rsquo;t even be here in the first place?</p>

		<p>So why not &#8220;OJ&#8221; this individual?  Someone connected to Señor Ramirez&rsquo;s victim should sue him for five or six million.  Leave him with just enough pocket change to get him back home.</p>
<p>After all, he&rsquo;s still illegal.</p>
