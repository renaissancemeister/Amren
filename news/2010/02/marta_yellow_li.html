<h1>MARTA &#8216;Yellow&rsquo; Line to Be Renamed &#8216;Gold&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ariel Hart, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Moving to tamp a controversy that has reached the national news, MARTA [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] CEO Beverly Scott said Thursday afternoon that the transit agency would change the name of its &#8220;yellow&#8221; train line, which goes to Doraville, home to a large Asian-American community. The line will now be called &#8220;gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott said the details had not been settled on exactly how to make the change, but it would be phased in  &mdash;  a less expensive option than implementing it all at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re thrilled,&#8221; said Helen Kim, director of advocacy and education at the Center for Pan Asian Community Services in Doraville. &#8220;I think this shows that MARTA heard our voice and they are sensitive to our concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kim said her group and others would pay close attention to the details of the transition.</p>

		<p>Except that &#8220;Gold&#8221; might be offensive Jews.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what color you call it, someone will be offended.  The best thing to do is not to heed some racial lobby&rsquo;s useless gripes.</p>

		<p>How is &#8220;yellow&#8221; offensive?</p>
<p>Changing the name from &#8220;yellow&#8221; to &#8220;gold&#8221; because &#8220;yellow&#8221; was too offensive would be like changing &#8220;white&#8221; to &#8220;ivory&#8221; because &#8220;white&#8221; was somehow too offensive.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>

		<p>It sure is fascinating how all non-white racial and ethnic groups adopt the Afro agitator stance of &#8220;Do you Really Know What Time it Is?&#8221;. Where I work I see this proselytizing, if that is what it should be called. The Alpha Angry Black Male constantly prods his fellow blacks and they almost always fall in line. He&rsquo;ll even prod other so-called minorities into acknowledgement that they are being hoodwinked by the Man(=Whitey)and even stupid whites in regard to class (that is the Politics of Jealousy). In the Afro community there is nothing worse than being hoodwinked and not knowing what time it is so belligerent advocacy is the only rightful response.</p>
<p>In this instance Helen Kim and other Atlanta Asians know what time it is-it is time to peck away at Whitey&rsquo;s rotting defenseless carcass and make a big deal over something stupid. Grievance begets grievance and a mobilized minority Vanguard is just what the Franfort School/Alinsky crowd wants.</p>

If I lived in a white community that was serviced by a metro train known as the &#8220;White Line&#8221;, I would be proud of that distinction.</p>
<p>Of course, if I did live in such a community with such a train line, I have no doubt some other group would be offended by the connection of the demographic of the community and the name of the metro line and demand it be renamed.</p>
<p>Minorities are filled with self-loathing and self-hate.<br>

		<p>This is all about minorities acting offended so that the white citizen majority will be taught to cave in again to minority demands.  It&rsquo;s not about Asians&rsquo; feelings about the usage of the word &#8220;yellow.&#8221; It&rsquo;s all about sending a message to whites that other whites in positions of authority give in to &#8220;sensitivities&#8221; of minorities, therefore, so should all whites think and act with the feelings of minorities in mind.  </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just ask them what we can think, say, and do before we even act, say, or do anything in our own country?</p>
<p>White American liberal elites are wimps and should all be impeached by the patriots who are still Americans. </p>

		<p>This is really hilarious!! Look at all the different colours and hatching used to denote the various lines on London Underground. I think every tourist in the world has a copy and most diaries printed in UK have a copy at the back.. so do British road atlases. I have never heard a single mention from anyone regarding a perceived racial bias according to districts served. However, anyone with the scantiest knowledge of any far eastern race would immediately nominate &#8216;gold&rsquo; as a lucky colour, closely followed by red. Yellow is not really considered bad and there is a Yellow River in China but USA seems to be continually bombarded by anything perceived as a racial slight. If MARTA had any political savvy, they would organise a passenger poll conducted by some reputable specialist and publicise the results. Just as a matter of interest, in London, the Circle Line is coloured Yellow and the Northern line is Black. Sorry, no gold, not even to serve China Town although there are two handy stations within a couple of minutes walking distance. If I don&rsquo;t get a free Peking Duck out of this promotion, I will not be happy! Ah yes.. Kong Hee Fatt Choy to all my readers for the year of the Tiger which starts 14th February 2010. Red roses for your Valentine? Now this just HAS to be a double lucky day!</p>

		<p>Why would Americans ever give in to demands made by foreigners who used the English language against English speaking native White American Citizens?</p>
<p>English is our language, and we use it however we want. If the blacks, browns, reds, and yellows don&rsquo;t like how the whites use our white language, then let them complain to us in their own native tongues. Let Babel rule. We don&rsquo;t want to hear them use our language to command us how to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Trying to placate minorities is a failed policy of the past. We must own the future by controlling the present.  <br>

		<p>Type &#8216;Gold Mountain&rsquo; into your search engine. The Chinese name for North America is Gumshan (Gold Mountain), after the riches they come here for. </p>
<p>The term Gold Line now has a meaning which is understood by Asian community insiders. </p>

		<p>Once again, this is all about power and control for non-whites. If they can control what we can or can&rsquo;t say, or even think, then they can easily displace and destroy us. The more we cave in to their demands, we grow weaker while they become more emboldened. Unless we take a stand now, this process will continue.</p>
<p>I also agree 100% with Brit Alba. Who are non-whites to disparage and criticize the language of whites using OUR language? Who are they to rail against the West while speaking English? It&rsquo;s time we take back our nations and civilization.</p>

		<p>Does the nonsense today know no bounds? I can&rsquo;t believe anybody would be offended by this. However as long as Whites cave into this stupidity, such people will keep pushing it. Would I be offended by a &#8220;White line&#8221; going into my neighborhood? Hardly. Only think I&rsquo;d care about is if the trains ran on time and were clean.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d agree with many posters that this is silly and annoying on the face of it  &mdash;  but I&rsquo;m a little surprised that other metro ATL posters haven&rsquo;t commented on the amusing irony here.</p>
<p>Remember!  &mdash;  Atlanta is a Chocolate City, and that means mandatory &#8220;diversity&#8221; of a certain kind in high-profile, high-dollar positions, as in mayor, education, and transit  &mdash;  and MARTA CEO Beverly Scott, uh, fits the profile (well, of you look hard enough, as I did).  I wonder if the phrase &#8220;uppity Asian&#8221; crossed her mind. I had to laugh.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s absolute worth noting a piece of recent context: just last December was the Atlanta mayoral runoff, with  &mdash;  gasp!  &mdash;  a white woman contending with a &#8220;diverse&#8221; male, Kasim Reed. For this reason alone, it attracted national media attention  &mdash;  the possible first white mayor of the city for thirty years or so. The results were exactly what I expected: very heavy turnout in a city of some hundreds of thousands, and after a protracted vote count, the &#8220;diverse&#8221; candidate winning by a whopping 715 votes. Yes, that&rsquo;s <i>seven hundred and fifteen</i>. It&rsquo;s a miracle!  &mdash;  but not a surprise.</p>
<p>So the local &#8220;machine&#8221; getting flak for comical ineptness in &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; made my day.</p>

		<p>When black african americans complain about white racism, I want to hear them speak in Congolese, Edo, or incomprehensible Ebonics. I never want to hear them speak my English to me in any form which I can understand. If they don&rsquo;t have enough respect for their own tongueto use it in matters important to them, then I have no reason to listen to them when they speak my tongue at me.</p>
