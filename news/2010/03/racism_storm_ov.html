			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A racism inquiry was under way last night after a firm advertised a £38,000-a-year job for someone &#8216;preferably of Indian origin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The advert was placed on a popular recruitment website on behalf of a computer company based in Britain and India.</p>
<p>It stated: &#8216;Minimum six years of experience in IT .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The person should be a UK citizen with security clearance from the UK Government. Preferably of Indian origin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The advert was removed last night from the website as the Equality and Human Rights Commission launched an investigation.</p>
<p>The wording was condemned by Conservative Monmouth MP David Davies.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It is quite clearly racist. I call on the EHRC to show resolute action in dealing with cases of anti-British discrimination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The advert, for the Bristol-based post at technology company Torry Harris, was spotted by IT consultant Vince Silva of Chepstow, Gwent.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I have never seen a recruitment advert like this before, and think it is appalling job applicants could be discriminated against in this way.</p>
<p>&#8216;It raises a wider question about the way in which some big companies in Britain are bringing in IT workers from abroad instead of recruiting them here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Recruitment agency McGregor-Boyall Associates said the advert had been placed in error.</p>
<p>Spokesman Farhaan Majid said: &#8216;This is a mistake. I put the advert through like this when I shouldn&rsquo;t have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;Some companies prefer to employ people of Indian origin because they are immediately available and don&rsquo;t mind moving.</p>
<p>&#8216;Often people in Britain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have mortgages and don&rsquo;t want to move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The recruitment firm&rsquo;s managing director Laurie Boyall said: &#8216;It should not have been put up, and was cut and pasted from material sent to us by a client in India.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jobsite.co.uk said advert content was the responsibility of advertisers and it did not check listings before they were placed on the site.</p>
<p>Torry Harris declined to comment, but the EHRC said: &#8216;It is unlawful to discriminate against a job applicant on the basis of their nationality .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We will be looking into the matter.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The financial elites know what they want below them.</p>
<p>A few educated, creative, ambitious whites.</p>
<p>A large middle class of docile Asians.</p>
<p>A dark underclass to justify an expensive state welfare system.</p>
<p><br>
There is no room for nationalism or racial family in the New World Order.  Immigration of Asians is part of the grand scheme to break white nations and racially rebuild them.</p>

		<p>I believe this sort &#8220;advertisement&#8221; is the forerunner of things to come, not only in Great Britain but elsewhere.  It is part of the displacement and the eventual destruction of the White Race.  Something like this may not be so tolerable now, but this is the way these sorts of things are introduced - S-L-O-W-L-Y.  Conditioning is much better when done slowly.  However Britain&rsquo;s days are numbered as a White country unless White people there awake from their slumber.</p>

		<p>If the requirement is preferably Indian, they will only have to look at the names of the applicants to determine their nationality, just as looking at first names in the U.S. we can tell if the applicant is black.</p>

		<p>This was not a mistake. Was deliberate.</p>

<p>There! In a nutshell you have the whole mindset. It was not a mistake. Very deliberate with intentional bias.</p>
<p>And must be a British citizen with a security clearance. But of Indian origin. Is there not a contradiction there? This is for some intelligence job of some sort I would surmise.</p>

		<p>As I see it, there are two possible appropriate responses to this:</p>
<p>(1) Throw them all out of the country.  (My preference).</p>
<p>(2) Impose quotas on all IT companies in the country.  Since the country is still 80% white, then 80% of all the IT professionals should be white.  After all, it appears that whites are an &#8220;underrepresented minority&#8221; in this field.  Applying the same logic as the affirmative action advocates, quotas are the only way we can be sure there is no discrimination.  Normally, they don&rsquo;t state in the advertisement that they intend to discriminate, so the only way to make sure that others are not doing this is to impose quotas.</p>
<p>If the British fail to do this, they deserve to be replaced because they are either too selfish to care about their race or too stupid to see what is going on.</p>

		<p>I took a job interview (by phone) for a technical IT position once.  The company interviewer and IT tech rep was Indian.  I flat could not understand a word he said with his accent and sing song way of speaking.  Seriously.  Not a word could I understand.  I had to ask him THREE TIMES to repeat each question he asked because he could not be understood.  Upon asking him the third time (on each and every question mind you) to repeat his question, he would, but then he would answer the question for himself and move on to the next question.  Now, this interview was concerning expertise I had 10 years experience in.  It wasn&rsquo;t the subject matter, it was HIS DIALECT AND ACCENT that was the problem.  Of course, I didn&rsquo;t get the offer having &#8220;failed&#8221; the interview.  I complained to the hiring authority and explained exactly what had happened and demanded they re-interview me with an AMERICAN.  They did.  A black guy called me up, asked me two questions (where had I worked, what college had I graduated from) hung up, and marked me &#8220;failed&#8221; again.  I decided I did NOT want to work for that company.  Duh.  By the way, if you&rsquo;ve ever called a 1-800 number for service and been connected to an Indian call bank, you know exactly what I mean as to the difficulty understanding Indians when they speak &#8220;English&#8221;.</p>

<p>By saying whites need quotas to be represented you are saying they are less qualified than Indians.  They aren&rsquo;t.  If the British would hire according to talent instead of &#8220;cheap labor&#8221;, most IT people would be white in that country.</p>

		<p>I think in the USA if an ad called for someone &#8220;preferably black or Hispanic&#8221;, nobody would complain.  BUT - if it said &#8220;preferably white,&#8221; - it would splat on the fan for sure.  Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it, that we no longer have the right to ask for what we want?</p>

<p>How does that follow?  You seem not to understand that affirmative action proponents do not believe that under-represented minorities are less qualified.  They believe they are equally qualified but passed over because of their race.  In the case of white IT workers, that seems to be the case.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see the big deal here.   Companies should be free to hire whom they choose, according to their needs.  They know best what their needs are.</p>
<p>The ad said &#8220;preferably of Indian origin&#8221;. No one was shut out.  The key word here is &#8220;preferably&#8221;.   It did not say &#8220;exclusively&#8221; Indian. Therefore, the possibility was left open to anyone, but preferably an Indian.</p>
<p>A further enlightening detail emerges when it comes out that the company operates in India. So it is hardly surprising that they might be seeking to hire an Indian.  If I had a company that operated in Brazil, I might want to hire a Brazilian.  If I operated a company in Britain with an American branch, I might be looking for an American. So what&rsquo;s wrong with that? <br>
 <br>
Government should stay out of these things, and let people and companies choose their own associates. This is not unreasonable discrimination; it&rsquo;s not about race, it&rsquo;s about business.</p>

<p>If such quotas are imposed, an unintended outcome of that  requirement could be  that it would only intensify the government&rsquo;s  (and business sector&rsquo;s) determination to further lower the white percentage of the population in order to increase &#8220;minority&#8221; hiring.</p>

<p>A third interpretation is that they are too cowed and too powerless to be able to do anything about it. I&rsquo;m sure that many feel a sense of intense frustration. And those are only the ones who &#8220;see what is going on&#8221;.  </p>
<p>What with thoroughgoing government indoctrination  (called &#8220;education&#8221;) and  intensive cradle-to-grave media propaganda bombarding them 24/7   &mdash;   enhanced and upheld by the churches and all the respected institutions of society   &mdash;    one doesn&rsquo;t have to be stupid to be utterly brainwashed.</p>

____________________</p>
<p>In the USA, code words are used which have the same effect for discriminating against whites.</p>
<p>When you see &#8220;Equal opportunity employer&#8221; or &#8220;Equal opportunity lender&#8221;, or &#8220;Equal opportunity housing&#8221;, and such other expressions,  you know what that means    &mdash;  -  no whites need apply. Or at the least, that blacks (and other non-whites) are given preference.<br>

		<p>sofita,</p>
<p>Yes,  I understand that quite clearly.  Quotas are demanded by minorities that are incapable of competing. White people shouldn&rsquo;t need quotas under a fair system.  All I am saying is instead of imposing quotas for anyone, just hire people according to merit.  The whites would easily win out over Indians.  But I see what you mean, in that you were speaking in the context of &#8220;if the system can&rsquo;t be changed&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In Australia and New Zealand the job ad would read &#8220;must speak Hindi&#8221; or &#8220;must speak Chinese&#8221;. This is perfectly legal but extremely insulting to the English speaking citizens.</p>

White people shouldn&rsquo;t need quotas under a fair system.&#8221;<br>
Courtney</p>
<p><br>
The whole idea that&rsquo;s implied by quotas and affirmative action is that the &#8220;system&#8221; isn&rsquo;t fair. It&rsquo;s based on that presumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s presumed that the system is corrupt. That white people have it rigged. That &#8220;white privilege&#8221; rules.  And no matter how many concessions whites give, it&rsquo;s still rigged;  and minorities are never satisfied. In fact, the more you give, the more they want.</p>
<p>In fact, no system would ever be recognized as fair by blacks   &mdash;   unless you hand them the whole pie.  They now have a black family living in the White House, and they&rsquo;re still complaining that the system isn&rsquo;t fair.  What the bleep do they want?</p>
