<h1>Illegals Increasingly Charged in Violent Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Freeman Klopott, Washington Examiner, March 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The illegal immigrants being held in area jails are increasingly charged with violent crimes as law enforcement agencies focus on taking murderers, rapists and gang members off the streets, according to a review by the Washington Examiner.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the criminal charges filed against the 274 inmates who were being held during the last week of February on Immigration and Customs Enforcement warrants in Fairfax, Alexandria and D.C. jails related to violence, drugs and gang participation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants have been charged in a number of high-profile crimes in the region in recent months.</p>
<p>»  Earlier this month, six suspected illegal immigrants were accused of gang raping a 30-year-old woman they abducted from an Alexandria nightclub.</p>
<p>»  In late February, two suspected illegal immigrants brought an 11-year-old girl to a Silver Spring apartment where they both raped her, Montgomery County police said.</p>
<p>»  On Christmas Day, authorities say, a suspected illegal immigrant stabbed his 25-year-old roommate to death during a heated early-morning argument in Rockville.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some immigration advocates are concerned that efforts to catch violent criminals could end up becoming a dragnet for all illegal immigrants in the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kerwin [Donald Kerwin, vice president of programs at the Migration Policy Institute] said the result of the increased attention on illegal immigrants, violent and nonviolent, will be that a system already &#8220;stretched to the breaking point&#8221; will fall into ruin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others say focusing strictly on rounding up violent criminals doesn&rsquo;t go far enough.</p>
<p>Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, said although applying resources to the most serious crimes is important, letting smaller offenses go unpunished has its dangers.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
<table width="400" cellpadding="7">  <tr>    <td><big><b>S<small>IDEBAR</small></b></big></p>
<p><b>Percentage of charges filed against suspected illegal immigrants:</b></p>
<p>Violent crimes: 31</p>
<p>Property crimes: 15</p>
<p>Drugs: 12</p>
<p>Driving while intoxicated: 6</p>
<p>Gang participation: 3</p>
<p>Drunk in public: 4</p>
<p>Child abuse: 2</p>
<p>Among the remaining 27 percent are gun violations, driving without a license, reckless driving and failing to appear in court for misdemeanors.    </td>  </tr></table><br>

		<p>Interesting and timely article. Just last week in my Northeastern City, a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy was forced to shoot down a crazed illegal that attacked the officer with basball-sized chunks of asphalt. </p>
<p>The officer was patrolling  at night near the airport when he came across the illegal walking along a pitch-black road that borders the runway. The officer stopped the guy to ask for id,when the illegal assaulted the cop with the pieces of asphalt. The deputy defended himself and killed the immigrant that turned out to be a guy from Mexico living in the US illegally with his brother-in-law. It is not known why he decided to attack the cop, but maybe he feared deportation? </p>

<p>The above links all from one source in one city on &hellip;.. one day.<br>
The last link is a quite interesting story in that 8 - 9 were arrested ( 1 killed ) in an attempted armed raid of a warehouse. 8 - 9 involved! When we hear statements coming out of Homeland Security stating &#8216;we have not seen that type of crime on this side of the border&rsquo; should we not demand someones job? I just saw another headline where some immigrant groups want the head of ICE fired?! I think I will turn my computers &amp; TV&rsquo;s off for the rest of today - I just can not bear too much more right now.</p>
<p>God help us!!!</p>

		<p>I am absolutely POSITIVE that you could take the statistics for illegals in any city in the U.S. and have the exact same results as we have here.  Everybody here in SoCA knows that half the illegals are criminals, wanted both here and in Mexico.  That&rsquo;s why I want the military stationed all across the southern border of the U.S., with orders to shoot anyone who crosses.  The Mexicans will squall and complain, but they also respect severity when it comes to us defending our laws.  Illegal immigration would slow to a crawl to non-existent with such a policy.  Of course the libs in our country would be furious, but they&rsquo;ll be out of power after the next election!  </p>

		<p>Like the war on drugs, this is another war that is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Because of the multicult strength in this country, the will no longer exists to protect US borders.  In fact due to the same thing the entire country is controlled by these radical leftists, and there will be no victory on the war on drugs either.  They will have to be legalized to stop the crime.  And, the illegal alien problem will continue until no jobs are available for these people and the country is bankrupt and unable to pay them social benefits.</p>
<p>So, in the end, if either drugs OR illegal invasions are brought under control it will be due to factors other than the &#8220;war&#8221; that has allegedly been waged for decades now.</p>
<p>Being a poor nation has its benefits, and if we break up into secessionist enclaves&hellip;.which we are bound to do either by war or peaceful acceptance&hellip;.being a smaller nation-state also has its benefits.</p>
<p>The coming collapse, rather than a catastrophe, is an opportunity to start over and maintain a good amount of land strictly enforced as a homogeneous country.</p>

		<p>This is a no brainer ilegals/criminals are plying their trades. I fear AmeriKa is having a bowel movement, and we are a basically done all but wiping. I&rsquo;ve really never been one to consider the glass half full, but now I fear it&rsquo;s nearly empty, and the second black plague is upon us. The crazies on the left have turned the country into a total nut house, and we are all the inmates.</p>

		<p>You break one law, you break a second law, you break a third law, hell, you might as well break all the laws.</p>
<p>Why not indeed!!??</p>
<p>An illegal alien by definition is breaking a law just by being here. Obvious. One law, two law, three law, break all the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not known why he decided to attack the cop, but maybe he feared deportation?&#8221;</p>
<p>The illegal could have not probably told you why! Just felt like doing so at that exact moment.</p>

		<p>Cops should adopt a &#8220;shoot first, ask later&#8221; attitude when dealing with [potential] illegal immigrants. We&rsquo;ve had officers murdered conducting routine traffic stops (running red light, speeding) by illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>The mere fact they have entered ilegaly, points to the obvious that they are criminals to begin with. The header could say the word ilegals means just that. This is something the left can&rsquo;t comprehend. Our glorious leader said in his campaign, &#8220;Words just words,&#8221; which in his case is true. No comrade Hussein, words actually have meanings, unless they are all just a pack of lies.  </p>

		<p>Does anyone think that people who laugh at the immigration laws of another country, steal IDs, present phony documents and give fake names won&rsquo;t stoop to further crimes? I thought I&rsquo;d read the worst of the crimes committed by illegals until I read an account the other. An illegal beat his 14-month old daughter to death. The beating was so bad, it split her liver. I shook with rage and despair when I read that article. Then the murder of the Arizona rancher followed that. People are murdered, molested, injured, raped and robbed every day by these sub-humans. I don&rsquo;t know what else to call them. We have been invaded and attacked and our government won&rsquo;t do a thing about it. The inept Napolitano says the border is secure. Even McCain called for &#8220;more&#8221; secuity. She &#8220;will answer him soon,&#8221; she said. Why not now? Why not send an army to the border and dare any of these murderous perverts to come across? We are at the mercy of these born criminals. Will anyone speak up for us or our country?</p>

		<p>From the original article: <i>Donald Kerwin, vice president of programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said, &#8220;The fear is that local police will start to go after people who appear to be immigrants for common traffic tickets, and these people will be found to be unauthorized and put in deportation proceedings without having been convicted of anything.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh, dummy, those &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; aliens or migrants or whatever you call them already commited a crime.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221; by sane people. They already qualify for deporation proceedings. </p>
<p>Donald Kerwin is just another member of our very own fifth-column (and proud of it, I&rsquo;m sure).</p>

They only come to work the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t take?</p>
<p>Just their presence makes the statement &#8221; I don&rsquo;t care what your laws are I do what I please, and you better have a lot of FREE things available to me&#8221;<br>
So my question is, what is all the debate they are trespassers and should be dealt with as such. <br>
Ask that Arizona Sheriff he gets it.</p>
