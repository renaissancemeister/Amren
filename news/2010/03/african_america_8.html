<h1>African Americans Watching Hollywood by the Millions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cheryl Pearson-McNeil, Chicago Defender, March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nielsen data shows that when African Americans are nominated in a major category, we&rsquo;re more likely to watch Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest night vicariously from our living rooms because we feel connected to the outcome. This year Precious was the break out success story. It received five nominations, with Mo&rsquo;Nique strutting away with that best supporting actress Oscar. {snip} Geoffrey Fletcher landed the best adapted screenplay Award, the first time an African American has ever won for writing. And newcomer Gabourey Sidibe received a Best Actress nomination. Or perhaps you tuned in to see if Morgan Freeman would take home another golden statue for best actor in Invictus, or how well The Blind Side would do {snip}.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I know: over the last five years Nielsen figures show a strong correlation between the number of Black actors nominated and the number of us who watch the show. So far, 2005 had the most Black viewers: 5.27 million. That year was huge for us: we had two best actor nominees  &mdash;  Don Cheadle for Hotel Rwanda and Jamie Foxx, who won for Ray. Jamie was also nominated for best supporting actor that year for Collateral, along with Morgan Freeman, who won for Million Dollar Baby. Actress Sophie Okenedo was nominated for best supporting actress in Hotel Rwanda.</p>
<p>In 2007 4.88 million of us tuned in marking the second highest Oscar viewership for Blacks. That was the year of Dreamgirls, remember? Jennifer Hudson won the best supporting actress Oscar for Dreamgirls. Eddie Murphy was nominated for best supporting actor. The film also won for best achievement in song and was nominated in best art direction, best costume design and best original song. The best performance by an actor that year went to Forest Whitaker for The Last King Of Scotland.</p>
<p>So even though this year&rsquo;s Academy Awards show had its highest numbers in 10 years for overall viewers, it was only the third highest viewed Oscars show among Blacks: 4.4 million of us tuned in. {snip} There is power in numbers. And this extends beyond the small screen to the big one. African Americans go to the box office an average of 7 times a year, which lends to the commercial success of any film. Keep that in mind the next time you decide whether to see a film in the theater or to view the version your husband&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s friend, Junie, wants to sell you.</p>
<p>{snip} Is it only possible for &#8220;our&#8221; actresses to receive recognition when they play downtrodden or contemptible characters? And do Academy members tend to favor heavier African American women to take home the golden trophy? With the exception of Halle Berry, has there been an exception to this weight rule, ever for a female African American Academy Award winner? Does this possible discomfort with African American beauty partly, then, explain why the stunningly talented Gabourey Sidibe, was not included on the cover of the Hollywood issue (March) of Vanity Fair? I mean  &mdash;  really? Gabby&rsquo;s first movie effort ever won a nomination alongside Meryl &#8220;16-Oscar nominations&#8221; Streep! Yet the New Hollywood cover was exclusively comprised of Gabby&rsquo;s less illustrious peers  &mdash;  young, all white actresses. New Hollywood? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} We ask that Hollywood keeps doing what&rsquo;s &#8220;right.&#8221; Because we&rsquo;re watching, literally, by the millions.<br/>

		<p>When in the minority they need &#8216;mentors&rsquo; to identify with, when in the majority, they need to be provided services by workers who &#8216;represent the population being served&rsquo;. What&rsquo;s funny about catering to minority viewers, and the interracial adoption article earlier too, is that when it&rsquo;s whites involved they take the complete opposite tack and whites are supposed to completely deny any racial affiliation or affinity - for that would be racist and hatred. </p>

		<p>Hell, we&rsquo;d be happy if blacks would just SHUT UP AND BEHAVE in the movie theaters!<br/>
But then, it usually isn&rsquo;t a big problem because whites have absolutely NO interest in the kinds of movies blacks just love.  None.  And even if they did, smart whites wait and RENT the movie so they don&rsquo;t have to suffer the horrors of a movie theater packed unruly, yapping, fighting blacks.</p>

<p>If anything, it is teenagers that exhibit the worst behavior in theaters. They laugh out loud, yell,scream, fall in the floor etc&hellip; Whenever I attend the a movie and see that more than 40% of the audience is teenagers, I promptly leave.</p>

This is a back door move to goad Hollywood to make more films with black actors.</p>
<p>This is yet another variation on the &#8216;black buying power&rsquo; argument.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before on many other such topics, if blacks believe they have this much importance and power, why aren&rsquo;t they setting up their own production companies? Why are they always giving this power to white people instead of seizing the opportunity themselves?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious: they don&rsquo;t as much power and influence as they want us to believe.</p>

		<p>If blacks watch the Oscars only when blacks get nominated for awards, they still watch it much more than I do. I have no interest in the drugged, siliconed, botoxed, self-absorbed, untalented liberal, prima donnas (and dons) that masquerade as actors, along with the poorly written, unstoried pages of special effects that are supposed to be a movie. I haven&rsquo;t seen a movie in years and years - since Crocodile Dundee, which I loved.</p>

		<p>Of course blacks watch the Oscars more when there are black nominees.  I&rsquo;ve noticed for some time that my black coworkers are only interested in performers, politicians, athletes, etc. who are black.  When Michael Jackson died, they had to watch the entire funeral on their computers.  They all worship Obama.  </p>
<p>Black contestants on American Idol will ONLY sing songs by black artists, and when asked to name their favorite singers, they always, always name a black singer.  White contestants, on the other hand, will sing songs made famous by blacks OR whites, and will often name black singers as their favorites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve attended performances that included black and white performers, and I noticed that, while whites in the audience applauded both the black and white performers, blacks would ONLY applaud for the black performers.</p>
<p>Blacks care only about their own race.  Period.  They prove this time and again.  They are the racist ones.</p>

<p>Are you not stretching the truth? I have been to events where I have seen Black audience members applaud White performers and vice versa. I am a 55 year old White male.</p>
<p>Maybe this has been your experience, but I am somewhat skeptical. I think that some posters (they are in the minority) make a strong effort to exaggerate their stories in regards to Blacks and Hispanics which unfortunately discredits the level of credibility of their own posts.   </p>

<p>I so totally agree with you. I went to a movie with my wife last summer. I live in Colorado. The audience was at least 70% teenagers and probably some people in their mid 20s. </p>
<p>They were loud, talking on cell phones, talking with one another, screaming, texting, laughing hysterically, constantly getting up to go somewhere etc&hellip; My wife and I were enraged. We ended up leaving after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel they should have several viewings of the same movie simutaneously and allow only adults over 21 in certain shows. </p>

		<p>To poster #8.  I agree, as well.  Young people today have little social behavior knowledge.  Respect for others has gone out the window.  When I was a teen 20 years ago, there was an understood code to follow in public.  Now there are no boundaries, and the youth advocates say this is good.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they are given permission to. In fact, it&rsquo;s not considered racism and evil, when they do it&rsquo;s considered tolerance and enlightenment. Everyone has to favor blacks. I don&rsquo;t think they need the media and school teachers to push them in this direction, if it were not so they would demand the right. </p>
<p>Interesting, Don Cornelius, the black host of the TV show Soul Train, was on VH1 last night talking about the show. Talking about his retirement, he said, &#8220;people want to watch other people who look like themselves&#8221; - I was too old. <br/>

		<p>The bulk of the movies which come out of Hollywood these days are filled with explicit sex, violence, and profanities, and they present a harsh attitude towards any viewpoint which isn&rsquo;t part of the new world order. If the movies aren&rsquo;t worth watching, why bother watching the Oscars?</p>

		<p>I think some of the Black actors who are considered good, or said to be good, are some of the most overrated actors out there.</p>
<p>I mean, take Denzel Washington, for example: the fact he is Black does help him. If he were White, he,d probably be considered an actor who&rsquo;s handsome, but has little range&hellip; But since Denzel is a handsome Black actor, the critics say he is excellent.</p>

<p>Because they know that their civil rights organizations like the NAACP will go to bat for them, in coercing those feckless Hollywood producers to create room in scripts for blacks. It&rsquo;s so much easier to let the wealthy whites do it for you, than to take on the burden yourself.</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. I went and saw &#8220;Avatar&#8221; about a month ago and black members of the audience seemed to be enjoying the movie as much as everyone else. Here in Dallas, I see black kinds wearing Nowitzski jerseys as much as I see white kids wearing Kidd jerseys at the Mavericks games. Point is, excellence is admired the world over&hellip;  </p>

<p>Actually, I would say Denzel Washington is a very good actor. Is he as good as Anthony Hopkins, Robert Duvall? Samuel Jackson? Daniel Day Lewis? Robert De Niro? Morgan Freeman? Sean Penn? No. </p>
<p>Is he as good as Phillip Seymour Hoffman? Mel Gibson? Michael Douglas? Jack Nicholson? Ben Kingsley? Ryan Gossling? Will Smith? Leonardo Di Caprio? absolutely. In fact, I would say he is better than all of the second group of actors. He is certainly above average. His race is irrlevant.</p>

<p>My last first-run theatrical movie was Howard Stern&rsquo;s &#8220;Private Parts&#8221;. You got me beat.</p>
<p>While on the subject of movies, I&rsquo;m probably the only person in America who has not seen the following in theaters when they came out: Lion King, ET, Forrest Gump, Top Gun, Titanic, and Avatar.</p>
<p>Nor have I seen any of the post- Stars Wars films. That&rsquo;s because I regarded the original Star Wars as comic-book camp, in 1977.</p>

<p>You obviously have not watched American Idol or at least the American version of the program. Contestants of all races sing songs from artists from all races. Jennifer Hudson (and other Black contestants), now a Hollywood star sang a number of songs from artists such as Carly Simon, Bryan Adams, Peter Frampton etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, there was a special tribute to the 70/80s rock group Journey. All contestants sang their songs.</p>

<p>Did you see Philadelphia? Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington starred in the movie. Tom Hanks was good and he got the academy award for his performance; However, it was Denzel Washington&rsquo;s performance blew me out of my seat!</p>
<p>It was even more impressive in that Denzel Washington had the more difficult role to play in the movie. Hurricane, and Malcolm X were equally impressive. This is not ot say that he has made some bad movie choices - The Bone Collector, Man on Fire, Virtuosity, etc&hellip; nonetheless, even though the movies in question were bad, his performance in them was still strong. </p>
<p>I have to disagree with you about Denzel Washington. Is he the best actor out there? No, but he is certainly one of the better ones.</p>
