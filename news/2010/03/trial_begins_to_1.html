<h1>Trial Begins to Decide Whether Dekalb County Discriminated Against White Managers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Visser, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Testimony is to start Tuesday in a federal trial in which plaintiffs contend former DeKalb County CEO Vernon Jones ordered a top subordinate to &#8220;dig up dirt&#8221; on top white managers because he wanted a &#8220;darker administration&#8221; to reflect the county&rsquo;s racial makeup.</p>
<p>Lead plaintiff lawyer Michael Bowers told jurors in opening statements Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta that three top managers in the county&rsquo;s parks department were humiliated, harassed and forced out of their jobs because of their race, and an African-American, who was once a close friend of Jones&rsquo;, was fired because he wouldn&rsquo;t carry out the orders.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Bowers, a former state attorney general, and co-counsel J. Tom Morgan, former DeKalb district attorney, plan to play for the majority-white jury a voice mail recording that they contend shows &#8220;an overall scheme in county government&#8221; to discriminate against whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Becky Kelley, who was director of DeKalb&rsquo;s parks department for nearly a decade, Michael Bryant, who was the deputy director for the parks department, and John Drake, another former deputy director of the parks department, filed a suit in 2004, contending that they suffered job discrimination because they are white. Herbert Lowe, a black deputy director in the department, contends he was fired because he wouldn&rsquo;t cooperate with the program to target white managers for removal.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black county CEO wanted a &ldquo;darker administration.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The charges are valid, of course.  We&rsquo;re seeing exactly the same thing on the federal level.  And competence is slowly becoming a thing of the past.</p>
<p>In another year, we&rsquo;ll see this present administration proving why black run countries are disasters.  Unfortunately the only things that surpass their incompetence are their prejudices and hate.</p>

		<p>Black incompetence may be the only thing that saves whites from the IRS and the coming new taxes.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re witnessing what will be the only time in history a black African minority took control of and destroyed a nation of white European descendents.  This is a largely criminal and hopelessly incompetent minority with no scientific, cultural, economic, artistic, industrial, imperialistic, or political achievements in its history.  It is a &#8220;culture&#8221; of primitive hunter-gatherers, capable only of the destruction of those creations of others, the clear evidence of which is everywhere their population reaches critical mass.  That thirteen percent of an otherwise productive, peaceful, and creative nation could be allowed to wreak such destruction is perhaps the most perverse collective insanity in recorded human history.</p>
<p>Can anybody imagine the Chinese or Japanese putting up with such behavior from any minority group?  </p>

		<p>Vernon Jones is one of the most corrupt politicians in Atlanta history, and that&rsquo;s saying something. He is also one of the sneakiest and slimiest. He is from the Obama Polish&rsquo;em up and Shine&rsquo;em school of Politics. He&rsquo;s clean cut, well groomed, well-spoken and well-dressed. But most of all, he&rsquo;s well funded.</p>

<p>No, they wouldn&rsquo;t have let the minority population reach 13%, or whatever percentage blacks are compared to the total here, in the first place.</p>

		<p>So when I hear self-hating white liberals chide and lecture their fellow whites about racism in America, point these stories out to them. Point out the millions of whites who have been raped, assaulted, robbed, or murdered by blacks over the years.  Point out the 35 blacks in Denver who attacked whites because of their race.  Point out the fact that Eric Holder has done everything to ignore cases of black racism against whites and that he didn&rsquo;t include whites as a protected class under the Hate Crime bill.</p>
