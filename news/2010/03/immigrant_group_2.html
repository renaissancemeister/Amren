			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, March 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of a march for immigrants&rsquo; rights in Washington on Sunday are reaching out to African Americans, hoping to bring the two communities together around an issue that has been a wedge between them.</p>
<p>The campaign includes ads for the march on urban radio stations along the East Coast, asking for listeners to lend their support. &#8220;Everyone has been hurt by the economy, especially African Americans and immigrants. The truth is, together you can demand real change,&#8221; the ads state.</p>
<p>The effort is part of a broader strategy among Hispanic, black and Asian civil rights groups to unite on areas of common interest and to get Congress and the Obama administration to enact major legislation on jobs and immigration  &mdash;  even as the nation&rsquo;s political leaders are focused on health care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The coalition-building approach is a shift for immigrant rights groups, which held similar marches in 2006 and 2007. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration activists took flak, even from supporters, after thousands marched on the Mall to demand U.S. citizenship while carrying flags from their countries of origin. This time, organizers want to send a different signal, tying their pursuit of a wholesale overhaul of immigration law to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cabrera [Clarissa Martinez De Castro, director of the National Council of La Raza&rsquo;s immigration campaign] said his group spent October and November going to Sunday services at black churches across Los Angeles, sharing the stories of illegal immigrants, and they&rsquo;ve begun sending news releases to African American newspapers and radio shows in California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the issue of job competition remains, said Vernon Briggs, a professor emeritus of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University who favors low immigration rates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Leaders of black civil rights groups push back at that idea. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and National Urban League President Marc Morial will speak at the rally Sunday in support of providing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new generation of leaders recognize the need to build stronger coalitions,&#8221; Morial said. &#8220;It is very important that the nation&rsquo;s communities of color do not simply see themselves as groups competing for crumbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, La Raza and the NAACP launched their first joint ad campaign in support of overhauling the health-care system. The Urban League joined with La Raza and the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development in a program to stem home foreclosures in minority communities.</p>
<p>A similar level of cooperation is happening in North Carolina, where the state NAACP and the immigration rights group El Pueblo have formed an alliance in Raleigh. &#8220;We found that the same forces that fight changing the laws to help immigrants also fight civil rights, they also fight health-care reform, they also fight educational reform,&#8221; said the Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP.</p>

<p>Every black that supports an immigrant&hellip;illegal or legal&hellip;.is supporting the loss of employment opportunities for blacks generally, more than any other race since blacks are in direct competition for the same jobs aliens fill than any other group in this country.</p>
<p>It would be a stupid move for blacks to support ANY kind of immigration, but many of them do.  But it has to be understood that blacks aren&rsquo;t known for their abililty to make logical deductions or to understand much of anything really.</p>
<p>Those who do support immigration are the same ones who shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly and blame the consequences on oppression and racism.</p>

		<p>Opposition to immigration is one of the few things that Blacks get right.  I&rsquo;ve always felt that Jesse Jackson and his kind were either blackmailed or bribed into ignoring the issue.  How could the Demos has said anything if he&rsquo;d taken his opportunity to put the liberals on the spot for letting the Mexicans in?  You could have been a contender, Jesse, instead of a bum.  </p>

		<p>I think that even the African American community, in this case, will demonstrate it has a high enough average intelligence to understand, that amnesty for the hordes of Latino illegals, is not in its interest.</p>
<p>In fact, amnesty, would be in the interest of only two kinds of people: (a) the illegals themselves, (b) a few rich people who own plants where they already employ boarder jumpers illegally.</p>

		<p>The Black leaders all sup at the same table with the Hispanic and White leaders of the Democrat party.  It is all about the political insiders getting the goodies, they do not really care about the average White, Black or Hispanic.  This movement will alienate many Black leaders from the majority of the Black population.  Hopefully the Black population will realize that most of their leaders are corrupt, selfish buffoons.</p>

<p>I am not so inclined to believe so - they actually consider them &#8216;walking ATM&rsquo;s&rsquo; &hellip;&hellip;easy victims that generally come without consequences. Blacks target illegal workers due to them carrying plenty of cash - via mistrust of banks. Additionally targeting them has lower consequences with our lil friends being leery of reporting these crimes to the police. Strange how reality can be sometimes? </p>

		<p>Hey, you know what might be a good first step towards getting blacks to cooperate with immigrants?</p>
<p>Not ethnically cleansing them via murder and mayhem from cities like LA.</p>
<p>Of course, any person who knows what is really going on knows the issue of severe hatred between these two groups is irrelevent.  Black leadership is for sale and always has been.  What black people as a group may or may not want is irrelevent.  Many are starting to figure this out due to Obama.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time.</p>

		<p>The Hispanics will reach out to ANYBODY who will help them gain amnesty for their buddies.  They&rsquo;re happy to continue with the policies that have bankrupted California, as long as they can continue to have welfare, free education, and free food.  And a fiesta with jumpers for the kids every weekend, and pay-per-view fights to share with the neighbors!!!  And maybe a cock fight every now and then.  If you mess with them, they&rsquo;ll get one of the brujas to curse you with items from the botanicos, and it is not good to be on the receiving end of one of those, regardless of what you might think of it.  I know from personal experience.</p>

<p><br>
Yes, but not as much as hispanics hate blacks. Blacks would have to be idiots to support hispanic immigration. Maybe there are a few blacks who hate whites enough to go for this. But they&rsquo;ll wish they hadn&rsquo;t when they&rsquo;re unemployed and getting ethnically cleansed by latino gangs.</p>

		<p>This is really funny. Calling out for blacks to support them. The same blacks they can&rsquo;t stand and the same blacks who can&rsquo;t stand them, this is hilarious. As a side note blacks don&rsquo;t even support Other blacks with them it seems to always be &#8220;What&rsquo;s in it for me, for free&#8221; and I couldn&rsquo;t care less about anyone else no matter what their color or race..</p>

		<p>Hispanics want blacks to support illegal alien amnesty?  Perhaps they should have thought of that when they were beating, stabbing and shooting blacks in the hell-hole both groups have made out of southern California.</p>
<p>It requires a peculiar mindset to want help from someone you have repeatedly victimized, but I suppose spineless white politicians have made this expectation rather less far-fetched over the last 50 years.</p>
