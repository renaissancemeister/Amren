<h1>&#8220;Reap the Whirlwind&#8221;? What Our Rulers&rsquo; Non-Reaction to AR 2010&rsquo;s Suppression Means</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, VDARE, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As VDARE.com was the first to report, the 2010 <i>American Renaissance</i> Conference was shut down by concerted, sometimes illegal action by people who hate free speech. Thugs who do not want anyone to speak honestly about race or immigration  &mdash;  even if they are not there to hear it  &mdash;  bullied and threatened four successive hotels into canceling contracts to host our conference, with the last pulling out just two days before guests were to arrive. (We were able to hold a much-reduced private meeting.)</p>
<p>It is, of course, shameful that anyone in America would deliberately prevent a non-profit educational organization from assembling to discuss matters of importance to white people. It is disturbing that the police did nothing to stop them.</p>
<p>And it is especially shocking that the Main Stream Media showed an almost complete lack of interest in this thuggish, contemptible behavior.</p>
<p>Nothing could more clearly highlight the utter lack of principle of our rulers and elites. If a non-white group  &mdash;  or any other group  &mdash;  had been treated as we were, it would have been a major free speech issue. It would have sparked a media uproar, and perhaps a Congressional investigation. But for us? Dissidents from racial orthodoxy are treated like dissidents in the old Soviet Union.</p>
<p><i>American Renaissance,</i> the monthly publication of which I am editor, has held conferences every two years since 1994, and in the Northern Virginia area since 1998. They have prompted protests and crank calls, but no hotel had ever canceled its contract.</p>
<p>Pressure began to increase, however, at the time of the 2006 conference. A hotel near Washington Dulles Airport that had hosted three conferences in a row decided it no longer wanted our business because of rising levels of threats and demonstrations, including a trespasser who shoved lurid leaflets about hosting <b>&#8220;racists&#8221;</b> under guest-room doors.</p>
<p>The hotel that hosted the 2008 conference came under even greater pressure. It was swamped with protest calls and the general manger even got death threats at home. Still, the hotel stuck to its contract. At the time of the conference itself, there were a dozen or so demonstrators, but they stayed off the hotel property and there was no hint of violence.</p>
<p>The real trouble began in the run up to this year&rsquo;s conference. The first hotel we contracted with decided to cancel when its managers learned of the pressures on the hotel in 2008. After that, we revealed the names of the hotels only to people who had registered, but three more hotels buckled under threats and refused to hold the conference.</p>
<p>Our opponents&rsquo; tactics were designed simply to stop the conference: flood the hotels with protest calls, trespass on hotel property and pass out inflammatory leaflets, promise to hold aggressive demonstrations and, of course, death threats. At one hotel, front office staff wanted to resign after taking calls like this one: &#8220;If you hold this conference I will go in there and shoot you.&#8221; One hotel even reported pressure from its suppliers, who said they might stop doing business with the hotel if it hosted us. There were also rumors that a local high school would be mobilized to demonstrate and leaflet.</p>
<p>A loose collection of groups that call themselves anti-racists, anarchists, and anti-fascists was behind this effort to stifle debate. Some are avowed communists who hate the World Bank and rail against global capitalism. Others worry about animal rights and global warming, while some just seem to hate &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; society, whatever that is. And they all oppose &#8220;racism,&#8221; whatever <em>that</em> is. Each of these groups runs a web site or a blog, and they often cross-post each others&rsquo; material.</p>
<p>Some of the groups that claimed responsibility for shutting down the AR conference were:</p>
<p>* One People&rsquo;s Project, led by a militant black named Daryle Jenkins;</p>
<p>* Responsible for Equality And Liberty (REAL), the brainchild of a confused former FBI employee named Jeffrey Imm;</p>
<p>* &#8220;Self-Described Anarchist Collective&#8221; (SDAC);</p>
<p>* Indymedia, a network of so-called independent alternative media sites;</p>
<p>* and even the Mormon Worker, a radical socialist newsletter for left-wing Latter Day Saints.</p>
<p>Other groups, including a British labor federation and the United Steelworkers, approved putting pressure on the hotels but had little real effect.</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center ($PLC to VDARE.com) also pay attention to AR conferences. But they probably want them to go forward. Hundreds of &#8220;bigots,&#8221; all together in one room, make good copy for pressuring donors: Fascism is on the march! The SPLC also likes to send a spy who can stagger back to conventional reality and describe the conference in frightening superlatives that will open wallets.</p>
<p>Some of the lefty groups operate under the umbrella of another organization, the Anti-Racist Action Network (ARA), which tries to set out a rationale for its lunatic &#8220;anti-racism.&#8221; Its goal is to &#8220;organize a variety of actions to expose, oppose, and confront hate in whatever form threatens the diversity and safety of our communities.&#8221; It claims to be fighting &#8220;white supremacist groups like the KKK and neo-nazis,&#8221; and intends to &#8220;disrupt and ultimately destroy these groups.&#8221; Its motto is, &#8220;Have fun, stay young, smash the fash [fascists].&#8221;</p>
<p>ARA has such a well-established reputation for violence that it is compelled to address the subject at some length:<blockquote>&#8220;The problem comes when we confront hate groups that are violent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ARA reserves the right to defend its members and other people against racist violence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We don&rsquo;t advocate violence as a solution to hate, but we also don&rsquo;t tell people what is the &#8216;correct&rsquo; way to respond to hate group activity.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>ARA confuses cause and effect:<blockquote>&#8220;Anti-racism doesn&rsquo;t cause racist violence; it prevents racist violence by making the racists know that a lot of people are prepared to take the steps necessary to prevent them from hurting others. Without strong anti-racist opposition to hate groups, it&rsquo;s not a question of whether a bigot will hurt an innocent person; it&rsquo;s a question of when!&#8221;
</blockquote>In 2007, I tried to give a lecture in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ARA-affiliated &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; destroyed my literature, banged pots and pans, and finally locked arms and pushed me out of the meeting hall. [<a href="/" target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz3BuqTQdMc" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Video</b></a>] Did they actually think they were <em>preventing</em> violence? Of course not. They are totalitarians who want, as they say, to &#8220;disrupt and ultimately destroy&#8221; people they don&rsquo;t like.
<p>The Halifax &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; also used a typical leftist tactic; they hid behind bandannas. Some of the protesters at the 2008 AR conference also wore masks. They claim that this is so &#8220;racists&#8221; can&rsquo;t identity them and hunt them down, but the real reason is to prevent police from identifying them when they break the law. I pressed assault charges against the Halifax thugs, but the police did nothing because they claimed they could not identify them.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t ARA just ignore &#8220;racists,&#8221; who just want to meet and talk to each other? First, of course, there is the <i>reductio ad Hitlerum:</i><blockquote>&#8220;When Hitler first appeared on the scene in Germany, people thought the best thing to do was to ignore him, hoping he would just go away. That example alone proves how foolish it is to close our eyes and hope that the racists will just disappear on their own.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>Then there is the obsession with violence:<blockquote>&#8220;Ignoring a problem never makes it go away. If hate groups encounter no opposition to their activities in a community, they&rsquo;ll take that to mean that they have no opposition there willing to stand up to them and they will act accordingly. This makes it more likely that hate group activity will increase and they will start hurting people.&#8221;
</blockquote>Presumably, if an <i>American Renaissance</i> conference were not picketed we would rush out and lynch people. Since ARA members are constantly thinking about violence they seem to think everyone else is, too.
<p>ARA knows its tactics violate &#8220;liberal&#8221; rules of free speech. But its obsession with violence trumps everything. Its members are convinced that anyone who talks about race and IQ, the legitimate rights of whites, or the disadvantages of &#8220;diversity&#8221; is on the verge of mayhem and must be stopped:<blockquote>&#8220;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives. You can&rsquo;t yell &#8216;Fire!&rsquo; in a crowded theater, because people will probably get hurt trying to get out. We think that hate speech acts in the same way  &mdash;  by trying to make certain kinds of people seem less than human and by glorifying violent acts against them  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before a follower or supporter of a hate group puts words into action.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>Their reasoning is bone-headedly simple. Anyone who says something ARA doesn&rsquo;t like can be denied free speech because anything ARA doesn&rsquo;t like can lead to violence. And it&rsquo;s fine to use violence to stop that kind of speech.
<p>The language these people used on the Internet to mobilize supporters shows how they think. After the first hotel canceled, the Self Described Anarchist Collective (SDAC) wrote:<blockquote>&#8220;Yo, so it&rsquo;s happening: American Renaissance is trying to have their racist, white supremacist conference right here in our own backyard (VA, what up).&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [SDAC] launched an oral sneak attack on the <nobreak>mothaf  &mdash;    &mdash;  as.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</nobreak> Proving that there&rsquo;s power in the phone lines, the hotel reversed their decision on hosting them and gave them the boot! Power to the People. Next stop: the next skeezy hotel that tries to host these bastards. Try it if you dare.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>When we contracted with the second hotel, this call went out from SDAC and allied websites:<blockquteo>&#8220;SHUT DOWN THE RACISTS! The white supremacist newsletter American Renaissance (AmRen) is holding their 9th annual [sic] conference.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [The hotel] has not made a decision yet on whether or not they are going to allow the conference to continue. There will be a massive phone-in all day on Tuesday, January, 19th, 2010.&#8221;
</blockquote>The groups suggested callers say this to the hotel:
<p><i><b>&#8220;I understand that several of the conference speakers have gone to prison for inciting racial violence, and in the interest of the safety of the DC community, and of all people worldwide, I ask that you do not endorse these views.&#8221;</b></i></p>
<p>This was pure invention. No conference speaker had ever gone to prison for any crime. And it gives the impression that the conference, not the thugs, was dangerous.</p>
<p>When the hotel at first held firm, the message changed:<blockquote>&#8220;SHUT DOWN THE RACISTS! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. IF THEY DON&rsquo;T CANCEL THEN WE CONVERGE! THEY WILL NOT PASS!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>As the thug sites explained:<blockquote>&#8220;They are apparently alright with Nazis meeting in their hotels. Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if they are going to let that scum stay in their hotels, we aren&rsquo;t. We tried playing nice, we tried asking, but there is no room for compromise when it comes to fascists trying to organize. The time to ask is over, now we take action.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If they don&rsquo;t cancel we will converge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to confront these white supremacists when they crawl out from under their rocks and try to gather! Save the Date, February 20.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We will not let them pass!&#8221;
</blockquote>Several hundred more phone calls, combined with threats and leafleting, and the hotel buckled. As its managers explained, they feared for the safety of their employees  &mdash;  and certainly not from us.
<p>When the conference was moved to its final hotel, in Washington, DC, something called DC Direct Action News spread this message:<blockquote>&#8220;NOW THEY ARE MEETING IN DC ITSELF INSTEAD! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You can see what hatemongering <nobreak>a  &mdash;  holes</nobreak> they are by visiting www.amren.com but be sure to have someplace to puke, because this <nobreak>sh-t</nobreak> is nasty.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>One People&rsquo;s Project was itching for a fight:<blockquote>&#8220;[A]ntifa is steppin&rsquo; out to play! We are waiting for the official call from other organizations, and when we get them we will post it here, but in the meantime if you were planning to come out, keep those plans. This is going to be damned interesting!&#8221;
</blockquote>Intimidation and threats of violence work. In the end, lefties were able to deny 300 people from three continents the right to assemble, and denied four hotels a piece of profitable business during a slow season.
<p>When the conference finally had to be shut down, I distributed a press release with what I thought was an arresting headline: &#8220;Death Threats End Biennial Conference of Controversial Group: Is there freedom of speech and assembly in Virginia?&#8221; I also sent notices to hundreds of radio and television programs describing what happened and offered to be a guest. I cleared my schedule and prepared for a media deluge.</p>
<p>Silly me. There was no deluge. The Associated Press and National Public Radio at first showed some interest but then dropped the story.</p>
<p>Aside from two small, racially oriented radio programs, &#8220;The Political Cesspool&#8221; in Nashville, and &#8220;The Derek Black Show&#8221; in West Palm Beach, Florida, only one radio station, WGSO New Orleans invited me as a guest. I was also interviewed for a podcast on the new website Alternative Right. I wrote directly to several conservative columnists asking them to write about this suppression of free debate. All I got was silence or regrets. Only John Derbyshire wrote an excellent piece on Secular Right, aptly titled &#8220;How Liberty Dies&#8221;  &mdash;  which was ignored, too. (Derbyshire also mentioned the conference on his weekly <i>National Review</i> podcast.)</p>
<p>I know of only one liberal who was outraged at what his fellow liberals had done. David Kelsey, who describes himself as having abandoned &#8220;fundamentalist Judaism,&#8221; wrote a column on his blog, The Kvetcher, called &#8220;Solidarity With Those We Disagree With.&#8221; &#8220;If we do not allow for free speech for those whom we disagree with and perhaps even scare us just a bit,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;how much do we truly value free speech?&#8221; He went on to call what happened to the conference &#8220;horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is Mr. Kelsey the only honest liberal left in America?</p>
<p>I am accustomed to being out of the mainstream. I was long ago hardened to the stony looks that greet any deviation from racial orthodoxy  &mdash;  at least when people know they are being observed. And yet, I have always had some faith in the basic fairness of Americans. I always thought that away from such aggressively narrow-minded places as college campuses, there was still some respect for debate, some recognition that we must protect our liberties if we expect them to protect us.</p>
<p>I am now learning a lesson I did not wish to learn. Our rulers and elites do not want free speech for anyone but their friends and their pets. They are utterly unprincipled, and have no idea what their lack of principle means for American society.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it is foreigners who understand this. The (British) London correspondent of the Wall Street Journal  &mdash;  not anyone in New York or Washington  &mdash;  interviewed me about the cancellations and quoted me on the lack of liberty in &#8220;the land of the free and the home of the brave.&#8221; Television broadcaster Russia Today invited me to its Washington studio for a very fair news segment on media indifference to the rights of racial dissidents.</p>
<p>But the American media? The people who presumably defend our liberties? They might as well have been the Soviet media under Brezhnev.</p>
<p>Many people have asked: is there no recourse to the authorities in cases like this? Hotel managers said they reported death threats to the authorities, but the police did nothing. We alerted the FBI  &mdash;  which claims to be studying the matter  &mdash;  but it shows no sign it will investigate. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice says it will not investigate because people who attend AR conferences are not a &#8220;protected class.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Yeagley, who has written for VDARE.com and who was one of the speakers prevented from giving his talk, points out there is much irony in the Justice Department&rsquo;s lack of interest [<i>Open Letter to Eric Holder,</i> February 24, 2010]. Not long after he was sworn in, Attorney General Eric Holder complained that Americans are &#8220;essentially a nation of cowards&#8221; because they do not talk honestly about race. The hallmark, of course, of an AR conference is honest talk about race  &mdash;  and that is precisely why the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; don&rsquo;t like them.</p>
<p>If Eric Holder really wanted honesty, he would order the FBI to ensure that our conferences had safe venues. But he doesn&rsquo;t want honesty. All he wants is for whites to apologize and beat their breasts.</p>
<p>The cancellation of the AR conference and the lack of principled opposition to it has other implications. AR has always operated on the assumption that American institutions can respond to the will of the people and that the legitimate interests of whites can be reflected in policy. I have always believed that progress can come through traditional activism, outreach, and politics.</p>
<p>My faith is not lost  &mdash;  but it has been badly shaken.</p>
<p>Those who know their history will remember that even at the height of the McCarthy era, Communists could rent meeting halls and gather freely. Americans understood the need to protect unpopular speech. No longer.</p>
<p>There has always been a segment of the racial right that never shared my faith. Many race-realists believe that American institutions are hopelessly rotten, and that whites will never get justice by conventional means. What happened to AR will encourage this radical rejection of America and its institutions.</p>
<p>Entirely aside from what happens to AR, the United States is moving in an unstable and potentially dangerous direction. From the call-ins I receive when I am on radio programs and the comments sections of even the most liberal mainstream newspapers, it is clear that many whites now understand what is at stake. And yet, aside from a few publications, websites, and radio programs, no-one speaks for them. In the official world of American institutions, everyone speaks loudly and hysterically against them.</p>
<p>In European countries not dominated by two parties, increasingly influential &#8220;far right&#8221; parties have begun to reflect the aspirations of whites. But in America, there are no such political options. And it now appears that even whites who wish only to meet to discuss what kind of country they are leaving to their grandchildren will find their meetings shut down by thugs  &mdash;  to the complete indifference of elites who prate about democracy, tolerance, and human rights.</p>
<p>Since the cancellation, we are twice as determined. Our voices will be heard.</p>
<p>But when our rulers are indifferent to the suppression of legitimate debate on the most pressing issues we face, they encourage rage and radicalism  &mdash;  the consequences of which no one can predict.</p>

<p>What is ironic about that is that the real communists that used to have real power supported global institutions, because that was the philosophical end game of Marxism   &mdash;   global government.</p>

		<p>We need to have a discussion among ourselves about how to have peaceful conference in 2012. It is all very well to talk about responding to violence from the Left, but the conference should be a thoughtful gathering. How do we do it? The weekend is not about fughting goons, but about comraderie. Posters should offer positive suggestions w/o tough-guy posing. </p>
<p>But another issue is protecting Mr. Taylor or other AR speakers when they confront bigots as in the Nova Scotia incident. For this type of appearance, there must be more coordination than before. First, a videographer to document Left threats/violence. Second, a phalanx of stalwart AR supporters to prevent actual violence.</p>

		<p>You should pursue your concerns through the Virginia State Police and cc to the Va. press all correspondences.  Their inaction can raise awareness amongst White Virginians and help to elect candidates who will investigate the authorities once in office.  If the threats were made and not investigated, then the investigators may have broken a law or procedural rule.  Name names and make them infamous as non defenders of our liberties.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Anti-racism doesn&rsquo;t cause racist violence; it prevents racist violence&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in good company. As &#8216;Illiberal Education&rsquo; reported, Harvard university put out a pamphlet saying, &#8220;affirmative action is not discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;different standards are not double standards&#8221;.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s tempting to tie these &#8216;anti-racists&rsquo; to the anti-nazi&rsquo;s. They believe &#8216;Nazi&rsquo; tactics work, and so attempt to use these tactics against &#8216;Nazi&rsquo;s&rsquo; and fascists. I believe it&rsquo;s more likely however, in this day and age, that they simply use these tactics because they work. Their writing is obsessed with intimidation. This is just the elite of the activists however. When it turns out the worker at the front desk, &#8220;wanted to resign after taking calls like this one: &ldquo;If you hold this conference I will go in there and shoot you.&rdquo;&#8221; I think it more likely, they &#8216;wanted to resign&rsquo; to prevent the conference from taking place. Intimidation filters down and changes opinions. Surely it if was a non-white group holding a conference they&rsquo;d be afraid Not to praise it.  </p>

		<p>This shows that America is well underway into a liberal<br>
multicultural collective totalitarian police state in which any <br>
deviation from the official orthodoxy is treated with<br>
abuse, contempt, and real hate.<br>
When a government destroys its own constitution, and<br>
ignore its own laws, will only get more despotic, in<br>
which its own corruption will bring itself down.<br>
I blame this sorry state of affairs on the mass media,<br>
in which a few radicals have been successful in changing<br>
the opinions of millions through false propaganda, and<br>
lies, and suppression of any alternative opinions.<br>
The schools, churches, and the government that were<br>
taken over by a radical and well financed elite that<br>
have radicalized the youth through communist, and<br>
immoral propaganda.</p>

<p>This to me, is not surprising at all; that the pace of &#8220;debate&#8221; stifling has increased from these Reds, doesn&lsquo;t either!</p>
<p>Not only is it expected, it would be surprising if it didn&rsquo;t happen. After all, with the elevation of our mulatto &ldquo;savior&rdquo; into the Kremlin (oops, I mean the Rainbow House in DC) why wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>This meeting needs to be held in a more rural area. The law enforcement would be more sympathetic (hopefully), and there would be less places for the agitators to hide. If they have to drive 400 miles and stay in the same motel as the event, they&rsquo;ll think about it. I just have a hard time thinking this sort of thing would go on in a mostly white, rural area.</p>

		<p>What we have had since the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement is a complete reversal of rights in this country. Once blacks were not allowed to have their own race-based organizations. Now whites are not allowed to have their own race-based organizations. Once blacks were not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods. Now whites are not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods. Once blacks were not allowed to meet at certain hotels. Now whites are not allowed to meet at certain hotels (or any hotels). Black groups that want to meet and say that all their problems are the fault of whites are welcome. White groups who want to meet and say that most of blacks&rsquo; problems are their own fault are not. Under the &#8220;two wrongs make a right theory&#8221; discriminating against innocent people today makes up for discrimination towards unrelated people in the past.  This is what happens when a people fails to stand up for their own rights   &mdash;   those rights get taken away from them. We are now well past that point in this country.</p>

		<p>Freedom of speech and other freedoms have ended or are in the process of being ended in America.  Some time during President Clinton&rsquo;s Presidency, the United States ended.  It seems that at the end of the Cold War between the USA and USSR there was a secret protocal where the USA agreed to surrender terms.  It was during Clinton&rsquo;s term when this protocol was implemented.  Bush was unable to change the government and his administration was a continuation of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s   We are now in the transitional proces of a surrendered nation.  Our military has been disarmed, our weapons systems have been mothballed and we really have a token Self Defense Force.  Things are being accelerated now because Bush&rsquo;s Presidency delayed the schedule.   </p>

		<p>Although the costs would be high it would be worth the fight to have the courts, once and for all, declare that whites are not a protected group.  That term, not protected group, to me means that whites are not entitled to basic civil rights.  This seems to have been the defacto status for the last 45 years or so.  Make it absolutely, unequivocally LAW!  The issue is skirted around by naming &#8220;protected&#8221; groups and the situations they are protected under.  I think it is time the government&rsquo;s hand was forced and they had to name &#8220;unprotected groups&#8221;.  Sure, Eric Holder says whites are not protected but until a judge pronounces it and his decision is upheld by the Supreme Court it is still defacto.</p>
<p>I am willing to venture that many working class whites, such as myself, would be willing to contribute to a lawsuit to settle this question.  The constitution says we are all equal under the law, or so I thought.  The constitution has been so perverted (example: double jeopardy is now routinely employed in &ldquo;hate&ldquo; crime cases) that perhaps it would be declared that whites have no basic civil rights.  The all of us would know for sure the system we are living under.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives. You can&rsquo;t yell &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; in a crowded theater, because people will probably get hurt trying to get out. We think that hate speech acts in the same way &mdash; by trying to make certain kinds of people seem less than human and by glorifying violent acts against them &mdash; it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before a follower or supporter of a hate group puts words into action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual these thugs believe they make the rules AND they interpret the rules. In this case they decide what speech is not acceptable, in this case &#8220;hate speech&#8221;, and they get to define what hate speech is. After reading some of their rabmlings, it is obvious they are spewing the hate, not Mr Taylor, et al.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;They are apparently alright with Nazis meeting in their hotels. Well &hellip; if they are going to let that stay in their hotels, we aren&rsquo;t. We tried playing nice, we tried asking, but there is no room for compromise when it comes to fascists trying to organize. The time to ask is over, now we take action&hellip; . If they don&rsquo;t cancel we will converge &hellip; to confront these white supremacists when they crawl out from under their rocks and try to gather! Save the Date, February 20&hellip; . We will not let them pass!&rdquo; </p>
<p><br>
This alone should be enough to ensure a criminal indictment against these thugs. And they followed through with their threats. Why are these people not in jail? And why has a civil suit not been filed against them?<br>

		<p>&#8220;My faith is not lost &mdash; but it has been badly shaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>My faith was lost years ago and I could have predicted this based upon the attacks which seemed to increase in intensity starting in 2006. But what&rsquo;s even more disquieting is that the culprits obviously have sympathizers in the media and inside government agencies tasked with reporting the news and enforcing the law.  Sadly, some of our fellow racial kinsmen are as much the enemy as non-whites and another ethnic group.  </p>
<p>Whites, especially those with a racial conscious, are fastly becoming disenfranchised.  The window for a legal, political solution is closing faster than any of us ever dreamed of. I am only stating the facts and take no joy in what the implications of that reality portend.  </p>
<p>I commend Amren for persevering; just don&rsquo;t forget that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.  The recent success enjoyed by the anti-racist crazies in shutting down the conference will only embolden them further especially since law enforcement at all levels grants them a very wide berth.  </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor, you should: <br>
1. Find a sympathetic private property owner to host your conferences. Something gated and secluded. Stay away from Washington DC. The &#8220;PC Police&#8221; in charge there don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s behind if your rights are violated. <br>
2. Spread the conferences around the country. I would love to attend, but I&rsquo;m in the Pacific Northwest. Moving them around might keep the hooligans off-guard.<br>
3. Sue the holy bejeesus out of them for violating your right to assemble. I believe you can use the RICO act here. It was successfully used against pro-life activists that physically block access to abortion clinics, so I don&rsquo;t know why it can&rsquo;t be used for your case. If you need money, take up a collection. Many of us will contribute. <br>
4. Don&rsquo;t give up the fight. No one else speaks for us in an intelligent, rational manner. Certainly not the Neo-Nazis, Aryan Nation types that claim to be White Nationalists but do nothing but hurt our cause with their loony goose-stepping and &#8220;Sieg Heil&#8221; nonsense. </p>

<p>Also, our opponents rely on force or the threat of force to achieve their goals. We must provide security to protect the conference&rsquo;s principals and its guests. The nature of that security and its expenses should be discussed forthrightly. We are playing defense, not offense. We cannot expect protection from the government. For us, nothing will come easily nor cheaply. We must be willing to spend. It will be worth it.</p>

My personal interest would be a reading/discussion group.  For the foreseeable, explicit pro-white activity on a political level will have to be limited to efforts at increasing education and awareness.  A discussion or reading group would give people both the converted and unconverted a chance to learn and discuss these issues, in a civil and intellectual environment.  </p>

<p>It is perhaps two decades since things weren&rsquo;t so bad that you could use your free speech writes (albiet ineffectively).  Today, there is no power in that.</p>
<p>From what I can see, the only solution presenting itself these days is entire states getting fed up with the nonsense of varying degrees.  States are legitimate institutions of law with the power to fight the federal government.  Increasingly, they are getting prepared to do so.  I think very soon that the US will split up&hellip;.and has enough guns to make sure resisitance to the split up is minimal.  Many of the new smaller states will think like us to varying degrees.</p>

<p>Tim, you can forget about the ACLU.  Once, many years ago, the ACLU did defend the right of some Klansmen to march through a Jewish neighborhood.  I am now convinced that they took on this one very radical case so that they could forevermore point to it to claim that they are &#8220;non-partisan&#8221; protectors of free speech.  The reality is they are leftist to the core, and won&rsquo;t lift a finger to protect the speech of Jared Taylor or any of the speakers at his conferences.</p>
<p>Some years back a pro-environment man named Craig Nelsen became concerned about the way mass immigration is overpopulating our country.  He started an organization called Project USA that paid for billboards that said things like, &#8220;Immigration will double our population in my lifetime and that&rsquo;s not fair.&#8221;  He never took any racial stance on the immigration issue.  Naturally Nelsen was vilified as a hater.  Angry Hispanics sent him packages with feces.  The New York City government suddenly &#8220;discovered&#8221; that a Queens billboard with a Project USA message was in violation of some zoning technicality and put pressure on the billboard company to take the advertisement down.  Once the billboard company replaced it with a Spanish language advertisement for toothpaste the billboard miraculously became compliant with the city code.</p>
<p>Craig Nelsen tried to enlist the aid of the ACLU in suing the city for the clear violation of his free speech rights.  The ACLU refused, saying that it would interfere with their &#8220;immigrants&rsquo; rights&#8221; work.  (The ACLU sues any state, town, or county that tries to enforce immigration law.  Of course these various levels of government try to enforce immigration law because our Federal government refuses to do so.)  If I recall correctly Craig Nelsen sued the city with his own resources and won the case.</p>

<p>Come now, Mr. Taylor, even I haven&rsquo;t been this naive. And I like to think you are considerably more worldly than I.</p>
<p>For two years recently I posted on knoxnews.com, the online forum for readers of Knoxville&rsquo;s main newspaper.</p>
<p>I was nearly the only poster who ever used the term &#8220;free speech&#8221; in a post. (As you note, long gone are the days when liberals frequently quoted, &#8220;I disagree with what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Instead of discussion of free speech, posts on knoxnews.com were filled with concern about &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>As American media and other institutions continue to condition Americans to regard &#8220;hate speech&#8221; as one of the greatest threats to American society and its new &#8220;principles&#8221;, the term &#8220;free speech&#8221; may eventually be regarded as just a &#8220;racist&#8221; code word for &#8220;hate speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>But maybe not. Among all the posters banned at knoxnews.com, most of them of weaker racial views than myself, I&rsquo;ve corresponded with a few who were infuriated with that newspaper&rsquo;s refusal to allow even the mildest observations on racial absurdities, or to allow other non-PC comments.</p>
<p>A great anger seems to be stirring among many whites. I actually doubt that &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is going to continue to arouse the same concern once times have really gotten much tougher.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of what I read on VDare about the courts forcing the BNP to accept members who don&rsquo;t even agree with the principles of the party. <br>
What happened to the American Renaissance conference happened to the Euro conference and in principle is happening to the BNP. To me it&rsquo;s very scary, it shows how unscrupulous the enemies of the white race are.<br>
As John Kennedy said, &#8220;When you make peaceful change impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I agree fully with your comments,Mr. Taylor. But realistically is this anything other than to be expected? Thanks to the libeal fools in our &#8220;enlightened&#8221; society preaching their dogmatic view of reality.</p>
<p>Instead of physical meetings in hotels, why not avail ourselves of modern technology   &mdash;   the Internet and make best use of technology to further our thinking. Live conferences on broadband Internet a common business/educational tool.</p>
<p>Where we can log on and listen first hand to TRUTH instead of swallowing the liberal slop and anti-White propaganda taught to our young in the bad joke passing for today&rsquo;s public school systems.</p>

		<p>Regarding these nouveau Hitler Youth who threatened hotels that were planning to host the AR conference, I think the thing to do would be to find out the individual&rsquo;s names, publicize them, protest their places of business (if they indeed work), threaten their places of employment with boycotts, etc.  Tit for tat, I always say.</p>

		<p>I have been reading the Amren Web site for some time now as I have wanted to see &amp; share the concerns of other moderate and intelligent people who can clearly see what is happening to Western Civilization and it&rsquo;s values. I have commented under the pseudonym of Dr M which is simply short for a nickname, Dr Moriarty, which I acquired in the workplace. I live in Sydney Australia and we to have the same concerns at most western countries re mass 3rd world immigration. As I have written in previous comments that if you dare say anything you are immediately branded a bigot, a nazi, or un-Christian etc.<br>
I agree with 99% of what Amren is all about and the comments on this web site. I dispair at what is happening to the America, also what is happening to the UK &amp; Canada etc. America was once the greatest nation on eath, economically &amp; militarily. It was also known for its generousity and as a morally upright &amp; mainly Christian nation.It also came to our aid in 2 wars. What has gone wrong? It appears that some of your cities must be like 3rd world hell holes or worse.</p>
<p>The problems and reasons have been given time and time again on this web site.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is: WHAT CAN AMREN &amp; OTHER LIKE THINKING PEOPLE DO ABOUT IT? HOW CAN THE ROT BE STOPPED BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.</p>
<p>Like most people outside of the USA I do not fully understand the workings of the your political system. BUT, if your present president was able to get the top job surely someone on your side of politics should be able to get the top job also! Hopefully in 2012! Political action MUST be the next step for AMREN.</p>
<p>In many ways I do not feel like logging onto this site ever again, reading it just makes me too depressed.</p>

		<p>This is not a rag-tag bunch of disorganized thugs:  It is an extremely organized, cohesive and heavily funded front group of useful idiots, most likely paid to do what they do.  The real power that provides the talking points, tactics (from &#8216;Rules for Radicals&rsquo;) and money hides well behind them.</p>
<p>Their power is such that they can muster up the support of the United Steel Workers and British Labour Federation, make sure the police, FBI, Congress, any politician and Justice does not investigate and keep stories of clear violations of Free Speech and Freedom to Assemble out of the msm, which Wiki describes as:</p>
<p>&#8221; The individual right to come together and collectively express, promote, pursue and defend common interests. The right to freedom of association is recognized as a human right, a political freedom and a civil liberty&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But not if you are White.  TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW.  </p>
<p>Is there any better proof that this government has declared war on Whites, stripped us of our basic, civil rights, refuses to allow us to peacefully gather, appoints an AG who declares upon taking office that new Hate Crimes laws do not cover Whites.  In fact, some government officials are calling for investigations into White Terrorist Groups and call for Homeland Security to be on the lookout for and keep an eye on White Supremacists who are &#8216;the real enemy&rsquo; (as foreign drug gangs set up operations in American National Parks).</p>
<p>Why is any White supporting a government that wants to increase the number of non-White Fourth World refugees from such hell-holes as somalia and myanmar, insists on leaving its southern border wide open so drug gangs and criminals can prey on American citizens (while &#8216;protecting&rsquo; borders in Iraq and Korea), is pushing for an amnesty for tens of millions of non-Whites who broke American laws and will overwhelm our welfare rolls  &mdash;  and then taxing to death productive Whites who are forced to pay for our own displacement and mistreatment.  </p>
<p>Amnesty will be the next push as the current government notices the rumblings of discontent from those it has abused and needs new voters  &mdash;  and a lot of them  &mdash;  to stay in power. </p>
<p>Any White who deigns to disagree or complain with this plan will immediately feel the wrath of the left via job loss, smearing of reputation, death threats or worse. </p>
<p>No one will come to your aid  &mdash;  not the police, the FBI or the Justice Dept. </p>
<p>We Whites, in the governments plans, are good for nothing except to provide cannon fodder and wealth for the government&rsquo;s overseas wars in Third World countries.  The government has its sites set on your pension plan next, to prop up the failed ponzi-scheme of SS  &mdash;  you will be guaranteed a &#8216;life-long government pension&rsquo; as your life&rsquo;s earnings are stripped from you.  The rest of your earnings will be stripped from you to pay for the government&rsquo;s socialist health care plan.</p>
<p>And no, I am not a defeatist  &mdash;  I am pointing out what is obvious and there is no refuting any of it.</p>
<p>Please Tell Everyone You Know and Spread the Word  &mdash;  we must work in White interests and ask ourselves every day &#8216;Is It Good For Whites?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget to donate to White causes you believe in and for God&rsquo;s sake stop funding non-White organizations ( I am getting a lot of pressure at work to donate to the odious United Way  &mdash;  but I didn&rsquo;t see even one organization that the supposedly help that aides Whites in any way)  &mdash;  they get enough White taxpayer money as it is.</p>
<p>I would advise you also keep an eye on your city council  &mdash;  they can cause a lot of havoc and damage to your community if they vote for more section 8 housing or volunteer your community to welcome and host refugees or declare that your city is a sanctuary city for illegal colonists.</p>

All of the would-be attendees can obtain the information they would have been given with little effort. The truth about race differences, especially black pathology, is I think becoming more widely learned and will eventually have a corresponding political and social effect.</p>

<p>Hey y&rsquo;all, can we PLEASE not make this thread a repeat of previous threads on this subject, in which every other comment says &#8220;I think you should seriously consider buying your own property to hold conferences&#8221; or &#8220;You should move the conference out of DC and hold it in the Deep South/Deep North/Deep West&#8221; etc? Regarding the cancellation(s) of the 2010 AR Conference, there are far more important issues to discuss than whether or not future conferences might be held within a convenient two-hour drive of wherever the commenter happens to live. </p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s ESPCIALLY not have any more calls for Jared Taylor to host the conferences in his own home! I have no idea how large or small the Taylor family house is, but I feel safe in saying it does NOT have seating for THREE HUNDRED! Telling Mr. Taylor he &#8220;should&#8221; hold the meetings in his house is not only rude but idiotic.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, why don&rsquo;t we all just stop telling Mr. Taylor what he &#8220;should&#8221; do altogether? </p>

**&ldquo;Free speech shouldn&rsquo;t endanger people&rsquo;s lives&hellip;.hate speech acts in the same way &mdash;  by trying to<b> make certain kinds of people seem less than human and  <i>by glorifying violent acts against them  &mdash;  </i></b>it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before a follower or supporter of a hate group puts words into action.&rdquo;    &mdash;   Mike Harrigan</p>
<p>These groups have no respect for facts or truth.  Their shrill propaganda reeks of hysteria and invention.   They lie and do not hesitate to misrepresent the positions of those they dislike. Since when has anyone on Amren ever, EVER advocated or &#8220;glorified violent acts&#8221; &hellip;. against anybody?   Sheer  nonsense!  But  it&rsquo;s worse than merely  nonsense;  it is a vicious and deliberately misleading falsehood. Their dishonesty (and their unwillingness to engage in debate) make them contemptible.  They don&rsquo;t engage in civilized debate because they can&rsquo;t prove their lies   &mdash;    and they know it!  But truth is not something that interests them.   Like spoiled, bratty children, getting their own way   &mdash;   anyhow they can   &mdash;   is all they want. They don&rsquo;t care about honesty, and they don&rsquo;t let facts get in their way.</p>
<p> **&#8221;This alone should be enough to ensure a criminal indictment against these thugs. And they followed through with their threats. Why are these people not in jail? And why has a civil suit not been filed against them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Good questions!   I would like to ask: were these calls recorded?  Were they traced?  Were formal police reports made?   Was there a follow-up investigation?    If not, WHY NOT?  Somebody here   &mdash;    either the hotels&rsquo; management or the police   &mdash;    is remiss.  How can civil rights   [one of the most revered sacred cows or our age!]   be violated  and even death threats be made, without law enforcement getting involved? </p>
<p>We all know if this incident had happened to the NAACP or the ADL, the case would be swarming with FBI.  There would be national headlines screaming outrage, and there would be arrests, followed by vigorous prosecution.  This only proves (what all Amreners know) that  in the present era  there are some citizens who are more &#8220;equal&#8221; than others. And there are some  (other) citizens who have lost their rights and are outside the pale of society, outside the protection of the law, who are abandoned and left on their own.</p>

		<p>OK, we should all know the score. The Anti thugs are not playing fair. The Washington law enforcement authorities are not being fair, the thugs get off scott free, brag they will shut us down again, everywhere. The MSM - Mainstream Media isn&rsquo;t being fair, doesn&rsquo;t cover this horrible abuse of our civil rights and yes, folks the mainstream Conservative media - with the exception of John Derbyshire at (soon to be purged from ) National Review is not being fair - it&rsquo;s a total media black out.</p>
<p>OK, so lets use are good minds, experience to come up with a new program given the very unfair situation. And it does not good to whine, appeal to the likes of Attorney General Eric Holder, the United Nations, Amnesty International, the ADL, SPLC etc.</p>
<p>Life for Whites isn&rsquo;t fair. That&rsquo;s the reality. Now lets fight to win.</p>
<p>My suggestions for the next Amren Conference.</p>
<p>Do not have the actual conference at a hotel - instead list the area and list 2 or 3 excellent hotels in the area people might wish to stay at - it&rsquo;s not an official American Renaissance event at the hotels, but people can meet.</p>
<p>The actually location of the event is kept completely secret - only one Amren person knows and we pay for 2 or 3 back up meeting rooms (school auditoriums - that kind of thing). Conference attendees are bused from hotels to the auditoriums.</p>
<p>We need to engage in various types of deceptions for the Anti thugs, infiltrators. We should have a fake conference of something like The American Renaissance Society book some conference rooms and this society will be an academic society of a few American studying the Italian Renaissance - let the Reds storm this place and just put it off that the Reds, Anarchists don&rsquo;t like the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>And we should be building our own media and not hoping for any fairness from the completely anti White MSM, Beltway Conservatives.</p>

   &mdash;  - H.Dumpty</p>
<p>It could also go the other way. As (and if) things do get much tougher, there could be all the more incentive for the government and the controlling Powers That Be to ban as &#8220;hate speech&#8221; any criticism of official positions and policies.  Orthodoxy will be required, and heterodoxy will be punished. They will hunker down, circle the wagons, and brand all dissidents and independent thinkers as &#8220;haters&#8221; and &#8220;social deviants&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s happened before; it won&rsquo;t be the first time.  The ruling powers always hate heretics who doubt their wisdom.<br>

1. Find a sympathetic private property owner to host your conferences.  Stay away from Washington DC. The &ldquo;PC Police&rdquo; in charge there don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s behind if your rights are violated. </p>

<p>Washington today must be regarded as enemy territory. Avoid it.  It&rsquo;s been captured by alien elements, and it&rsquo;s now the government against the citizens.

		<p>This is what &#8220;working within the system&#8221; means when the system is deliberately stacked against you.  How many victims of Soviet communism ever threw off their chains by &#8220;working within the system?&#8221;  Time is running out, folks.  And expecting our enemies to play by the rules isn&rsquo;t only foolish, it&rsquo;s suicidal.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;A great anger seems to be stirring among many whites. &#8220;</i></p>
<p>Yes, it is.  The controlled governmedia are well aware of this, which is why they work 24/7 to convince the White masses that we are living in the finest of all multicultural worlds.  Yet they must constantly ramp up the propaganda barrage as White anger grows.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;As John Kennedy said, &ldquo;When you make peaceful change impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable.&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>JFK spoke wisely.  The lid can only be kept on White resentment for so long.  And when it finally erupts, the prim and proper Whites who look down upon those with less delicacy and decorum as &#8220;violent neo-Nazis, skinheads and Hitler-worshippers,&#8221; are going to be left adrift, still twittering about decorum and politeness as their new dark masters lead them away in chains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unpalatable truth, but Mr. Jared Taylor seems to understand it.  Perhaps he always did, but was hoping against hope that it could be otherwise.  I pray we will all join him in this epiphany.<br>

		<p>Everyone who posts on AMREN obviously has a computer. AMREN must have a solid secure server or the mugabes would have spiked it by now. I&rsquo;ve proposed a virtual conference before and I&rsquo;m not the only one. Stick it on the web. Teleconferencing is not new so all the bugs have been ironed out. Many small venues can be linked without threats from the communists meaning much. Disinformation tactics can be used as to the actual locations and a password secure message centre can be run via this site to provide links. I&rsquo;m sure there are many others out there who can come up with lots of ideas. Obama made full use of the web, and he won!! Maybe talk to his web advisers!!</p>

I noticed at the time that these same people did not attend motorcycle rallies to throw red paint onto bikers wearing leather.  What this says is that the folks at OPP, SDAC, and so-on are smart enough to calculate the genuine risks, and that - their own propaganda aside, they know that AmRen supporters are not genuinely violent.</p>
<p>As a quick reality check; which is the safer target for red paint?  A middle-aged woman wearing fur, or a biker wearing leather?  If your answer is the obvious one, you understand exactly why these poseurs pretending to be &#8220;antifascist heroes&#8221; chose AmRen instead of any of the genuinely dangerous groups.</p>

		<p>The next time around, lets be vigilant. Lets get documentation of what the enemies of free speech are doing, namely making death threats against hotel employees and others. Maybe the department of just-us will get involved, or more likely, they will not, because we are not a &#8220;protected class&#8221;.</p>

		<p>To #48: I can understand your frustration of hearing the same thing repeated over and over again, but I would just say recognize it as people trying to find some way to prevent this from happening again. It&rsquo;s not about telling Jared Taylor what to do because what has happened impacted far more than the conference. It impacts every race-realist&rsquo;s right to assemble, right to speak out, and the right to be safe in their communities. Are we going to wait until someone gets hurt or killed? Can you imagine our reaction should the courts not do anything should that happen? Several years ago there was such an incident where a number of these &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; attacked a bus of people and all were cleared. And of course, they actually put their hands on Mr. Taylor in Nova Scotia and not one arrest! Let us all vent, even if it is repeated. Someone might actually start applying one of the suggestions. It will be a far cry from what has taken place in recent years.</p>
<p>And one thing I must stress as I have in the past, do NOT forgo Washington D.C. The last thing we should ever allow this hate-filled cabal do is chase us out of the hub of political power in this country, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

		<p>#29 crypto: &#8220;To me what is most missing is opportunity for people to get together locally, for the purpose of learning, socializing, commiserating, and, when the time is right, getting involved in pro-white activities at the local level. My personal interest would be a reading/discussion group.&#8221;</p>
<p>I completely agree with crypto here.  I realize that posters on this website are spread all across this vast nation, but I don&rsquo;t believe that should deter us.  Many of us do a fair amount of traveling, so why not set up some smaller gatherings in person.  I would absolutely LOVE to meet some of the people who post comments on this site.  It would seem to me that sometime soon we are going to have to organize on a face-to-face level within groups.  Holding a conference every two years isn&rsquo;t enough.  We should set up regional meeting groups to get to know one another (beyond what we see on the computer screen).  It can only serve to strengthen solidarity and advance our cause.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ironically, if AmRen supporters actually were the &ldquo;violent&rdquo; people these free-speech haters accuse us of being, they would have tried this sort of approach only once, and the chastened survivors would be henceforth more circumspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have laid eyes upon these specimens at prior AR events and to a man they are pencil-necked geeks with no upper body strength. I am not joking when I say 5-6 average AR attendees could chase them away.<br>

<p>I suspect they are the main conduit for the financing of these groups who eat away at the foundations of white society.  They apparently have the freedom to operate outside of the laws of the land as well, hence, no police action. Many thanks to the person who found this, as well as AmRen for posting it.</p>

		<p>With regard to messages 31 and 47 above, is it not possible<br>
(whether prudent or not ) to seek a writ of mandamus  vis a<br>
vis police inaction at either local, state, or federal levels? </p>
<p>The features of Skokie do not afford much analogy to the AR<br>
Conference.  ACLU has its share of those of us ( as I note<br>
to ACLU each year when I pay modest dues ) who hold our noses<br>
and remain members with regard, and remembrance, to those instances when ACLU has supported the persecuted forces of tradition and cultural conservation.  Too, local and state chapers of ACLU vary in their tone and political climate.  It should not be insuperably difficult to get resolutions from some of the local and state chapters within ACLU  commending a review and position at the national level re<br>
the rights at issue in the matter of the 2010 cancellations.  The ACLU leadership deserves the responsiblity of explicitly addressing those  members who are willing to ask for regard to this matter. </p>

		<p>(1) While primate anger and determination after the fashion of an athletic locker room are a useful part of the reaction ingredients in this matter, a larger portion ought to be the dispassionate analysis and self-control that might arise from,<br>
say, a Sandhurst, where it is well understood that tactical  retreat and even temporary withdrawal are frequently the road to strategic victory.  <br>
(2) The reflexive suggestions about legal recourse ought to be soberly scrutinized.  Our legal system, particularly in high voltage matters like this, offers, at best, now-and-then Justice.<br>
Getting a brilliant, decent, law abiding person under oath in a witness chair is in metaphor not unlike making him a target for a firing squad.   And what the Court system can&rsquo;t be perverted  to do, the MSM can complete.  <br>
(3) It is tempting to see the &#8220;enemy&#8221; in terms of the utterances and personal conduct of the thugs Mr. Taylor quotes.  But is it not presumptuous to ignore the possibility that most of this assault upon liberty might be heavily orchestrated?  In a brawl, one does not hit the opponent&rsquo;s fists or arms, and metaphorically, it is only fists and arms that are seen thus far in this matter.  Much of the antics of these overt thugs obviously is congruent with a sort of &#8220;tatoo&#8221; defense  &mdash;  waving a tatoo on arm and screaming.   We can expect Courts to be &#8220;tolerant&#8221; to a fault about such emotional displays. <br>
(4) AR has done a far better job spreading understanding than of giving cognizance to the power of misunderstanding.  Can we expect the average, ATF or FBI agent, to have come off campus into his role with anything but massive and layered misinformation about race?  To see Rushton, Lynn, Levin, the late Glayde Whitney as anything but &#8220;racists masquerading as scientists&#8221;?  Far more attention needs to be allocated to detailed examination and modeling of the mental constructs and <br>
slective perceptions within &#8220;enemy territory&#8221; than merely a somewhat prideful assumption that our insights are destined to gain ground merely because they accord far better with reality.<br>
(5)The economy ought to watched very closely, for, as Mosley once put it, &#8220;Sometimes the whole show has to fall apart before much of anything gets done&#8221;  Sad truth, but true nonetheless.  <br>

		<p>I understand Jared&rsquo;s incredulity. I also Jared is under no illusions about this.  To be so would be to assume that one was truly under the illusion that this government could be made to feel shamed that it conducts itself in such a manner.</p>
<p>The real truth, of course, is that the government does not care how it conducts its business, and that the hypocricy it displays in cases like this is simply shrugged off as &#8216;the price of doing business.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Messages 58 and 67, among others here, might synthesize into<br>
a meld of (a)  technetronic distance reach from (b)  a core of conventional on-site presenters at some Hotel outside of the DC area.  There is no obvious reason why the bulk of the &#8220;attendees&#8221; / audience/  would have  to be physically present where the presenters are if the personal interactions and synergies are to be at the local/regional levels via technetronic access.  I leave it to brighter folks to devise how for media drama a single in-exile on-site small core of AR presenters and recognized AR key players   might assemble in, say,  Lenningrad or Tokyo or Shanghai to reach back technetronically to various regional conventional meeting sites within the US. We&rsquo;ve come full circle when our national media will discover us in exile and report breaking news from afar but otherwise remains  blind to our presence while &#8220;domesticated&#8221;.  </p>

__   __   __   __   __   __   __   </p>
<p>Exactly.  The  threatened Skokie march [1977-78] was a gang of  publicity-grabbing, goose-stepping, television &#8220;nazis&#8221; led by a &#8220;Fuehrer&#8221; named Frank Collin who turned out to be the son of a Jewish Holocaust survivor named Cohen.  They were defended by David Goldberger of the ACLU, receiving much publicity.   Skokie, a Chicago suburb, had at that time the densest concentration of Holocaust survivors in America.   This event coincided with the release of the television drama, &#8220;The Holocaust&#8221;  (1978)  which  was the Jewish answer to   &#8220;Roots&#8221;.</p>
<p><i> &#8220;Collin lost that  [nazi]  position when his Jewish ancestry came to light. Collin&rsquo;s downfall began with the revelation that his father, Max Simon Collin, was a Jew whose original surname had been &#8220;Cohen&#8221;.  Max Cohen/Collin claimed to have been a prisoner at Dachau concentration camp.&#8221;  [Wiki]  </i>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Collin" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Collin</a></p>
<p>Furthermore,  the ballyhooed march through Skokie (1977-78), which received tremendous national attention, and whipped up much hysteria (and donations),<b> never actually took place </b>in the long run. </p>
<p>After Collin/Cohen was outed, he became  a &#8220;New Age&#8221; author. He was arrested by Michigan State police  in 1979 on charges of having sex with two ten-year old boys and served a 3-yr. prison term there.  After  that, he got into witchcraft, and more lately, according to Wikipedia, is now a proponent of neo-paganism and of theories about &#8220;the lost civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria&#8221;.  (There is no indication  to this date that he has ever worked for a living.)<br>

		<p>Cohen wasn&rsquo;t actually a &#8220;Nazi&#8221;.  The whole threat to march was an attention-seeking put-up job, timed - as Browser wrote above - to coincide with the release of the TV miniseries &#8220;Holocaust&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The clear founding aim of the ACLU  &mdash;  whatever the current ACLU perversions from that aim may be  &mdash;  if honored now, would make the abuses visited recently upon AR of particular interest to ACLU.<br>
The larger question is whether it is wise for AR to &#8220;play Russian routlette&#8221; in our problematic legal system by initiating legal actions, regardless of whether such actions had third party support.  Any such case would end up being &#8220;tried&#8221; in significant part on the steps of the Courthouse before media cameras and not merely or even mainly within the Courtroom.  It is risky, at best.          </p>

		<p>With reference to &#8220;rage / radicalism/ consequences&#8221;, Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s commentary ought to suggest to perceptive eyes in<br>
DoJ, FBI, etc. that law enforcement power, the moreso in our<br>
nation, is most secure when it is optimised  &mdash;  not when it is overextended and &#8220;consolidated&#8221;.  Mr. Taylor has brilliantly put the ball in their court.  Continued failure of them to act in their (incidentally his and our and everyone&rsquo;s ) interest in this matter of abuses toward AR will suggest the distinct possibility that their power has been largely siphoned into the hands of $elf-appointed &#8220;witchfinding&#8221; group$ successfully beguiling regional and local law enforcement.  That would represent a tragic historical benchmark.  There are overarching similarities across cultures in a matter like this.  Ask the bullet riddled ghost of Beria how easy it is for a brilliant <br>
(if character flawed )national security leader to regain optimisation after he/she has been goaded into permitting it to be overextended.  </p>

		<p>All you need is a IQ of about 50 to see who the real hate groups are. They are the above mentioned One People&rsquo;s Project, Real, SDAC, Indymedia, The Mormon Worker.  One of the worst and violent is the ADA along with those that are not so violent but are proficient in spreading anti-white hate propaganda like the ADL, SPLC, and the ACLU.<br>
   Not only are these groups hateful against whites but they also hate America. The Constitution means nothing to the above groups neither does our founding fathers who started this country. <br>
   In contrast, the people that make up AMREN are peaceful law-abiding citizens that are patriotic and proud to be white. The founder Jared Taylor and all the friends and supporters of AMREN have never threatened to kill or hurt anybody. We have never threatened to shut down people that don&rsquo;t agree with us with violence or hate propaganda. Anybody can post here that has a differing opinion in fact the posting rules say that detractors are given more lee-way than those that are not. We have one thing that is always on our side and that one most important thing is THE TRUTH!  And like Jack says in the movie A Few Good Men  &#8220;THEY CAN&rsquo;T HANDLE THE TRUTH&#8221;<br>
   What is even worse is law enforcement that fails to enforce the law and puts at risk people&rsquo;s safety in an effort to be politically correct which makes them nothing but cowards.  In the above case death threats were made, violence was threatened, Jared Taylor was assaulted and nothing was done.  Oh! I forgot whites are not a &#8220;protected class&#8221; of people.  I guess that out dated term &#8220;equal protection under the law&#8221; no longer means anything along with the Constitution. I get a kick out of when the above hate groups call AMREN a bunch of Nazis when it&rsquo;s them that are acting more like Nazis right down to killing people that don&rsquo;t agree with you.  Hypocrites, Hypocrites, Hypocrites.       <br>
   This is why the above hate mongers were able to shut down the AMREN conference.  It&rsquo;s because they know they can do anything they want without without any fear of the police or media coverage but if AMREN even lifts a finger to protect themselves by fighting back they will go to jail and be castrated big time by the media.  What the solution to all of this is I have no idea, but it&rsquo;s only going to get worse with Obama being President.    </p>
