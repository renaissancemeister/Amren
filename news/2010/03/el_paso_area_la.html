<h1>El Paso Area Law Enforcement Officers Targeted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monica Balderrama, KFOX-TV (El Paso), March 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barrio Azteca gang members say they plan to kill law enforcement officers in the El Paso area as retaliation, the [Department of Homeland Security] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The officer safety alert stated that the Barrio Azteca gang may authorize the attempted murder of law enforcement officers as retaliation.</p>
<p>Last week, the FBI and DEA conducted a sweep of Barrio Azteca members, resulting in the arrest of dozens alleged gang members. The gang has ties with the Juárez drug cartel and is under scrutiny for its possible involvement in the murders in Juárez of three people tied to the U.S. Consulate. FBI officials said the threat is uncorroborated but want to warn officers anyway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Orta said now more than ever his officers do radio checks to make sure they know where everyone is at all times. And he makes sure he watches his own back so he can make it home after his shift.</p>

		<p>In a &#8220;diverse&#8221; society, one can&rsquo;t distinguish his friends from his enemies.  Because citizens of his own country can be of any race, there is no way to tell who is native and who is foreign.  It is a built-in flaw of multiracial societies.  Now it appears officers are going to die for that &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  If they stop or search only Hispanic looking people, they&rsquo;ll be accused of racial profiling and racism and yet they can&rsquo;t possibly check everybody.  So we end up with one of two options: either an overbearing police state where anybody can be subject to random searches or an extremely dangerous society where people must always look behind their back and bodies turn up everywhere.  This is the outcome of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is the first I&rsquo;m hearing about this.  All I&rsquo;ve heard on the MSM today was about a few white people in trailers in Michigan who supposedly wanted to kill Muslims, but are charged instead with &#8220;conspiring&#8221; to do something to some cops at a funeral for another cop with a &#8220;weapon of mass destruction.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Think about this for a minute. Think of all of the ramifications of this, and of the people responsible for bringing about this outrageous situation. How low have our so-called elected leaders brought us, that foreign criminals can target our LAW OFFICERS, WITH IMPUNITY. JUST ANOTHER MINDBOGGLING SITUATION, CREATED BY NOT TAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND OUR BORDERS SERIOUS.</p>

		<p>One way to instantly stop this from happening is to pass a national law that makes every welfare recipient have to take a drug test every month.  Fail once, no welfare that month.  Fail three times, permanent ineligibility for all welfare forever.</p>
<p>These gangs are all about drugs.  And 100% of the money used to buy those drugs comes from welfare.  If we dismantled welfare, alot of legitimate poor would suffer.  But a drug test policy like this would QUICKLY separate the criminals from the legitimate poor.  It would actually, dramatically increase the money and resources for the poor because it would no longer be funneled to drug gangs by (mostly non-white) crackheads stealing from the welfare system.</p>
<p>I notice that Oklahoma has already passed a law along these lines (for exactly the reason I mentioned).  The result will be gangs leaving the state immediately because there are no drug profits to be had.</p>

		<p>Legalize drugs in this country, and the Mexican drug lords will be out of business. As long a there is a great deal of money to be made only because there is demand for something that is illegal, there are people who will fill that need. Often that sort of person is a vicious criminal. But without laws making drugs illegal, there is no huge profit to be made.</p>
<p>The only people favoring the drug laws are the people who benefit  &mdash;  people in the criminal &#8220;justice&#8221; system, and drug dealers. There is one other group that favors drug laws  &mdash;  fools.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mexican gang says it will kill American police officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting to read news reports of this exact thing for quite a while now.  </p>
<p>The media tries to get us to swallow their line that the cartels are afraid to do any killing on this side of the border, especially any involving law enforcement or politicos, but that&rsquo;s no more than disengenuous spin.  Or they&rsquo;re just assuming that to be the case. They&rsquo;ll kill anybody who they perceive is a threat to their power or profit.</p>
<p>By the DHS&rsquo;s own estimate there are 200 cities in the US&hellip;including the interior&hellip;.that have drug gangs using them  as distribution points.  There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that as they get stronger and bigger they will pass on excuting law enforcement here just as they do in Mexico.  </p>
<p>Inter gang killings are dependent on just which cartels might be in the same cities.  Right now I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t think those who are following the migration know either. </p>
<p>I do think, however, that we just might see the drug war raging in several US border cities as bad as it is in Mexico right now.</p>

		<p>A reminder of the frequent savage attacks on white farming families in South Africa by raging packs of Blacks.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s leadership also display&rsquo;s reckless disregard of those white family&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Most disturbing is both governments seem to have disguised their culpability in these terrible murders by merely sitting idle.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, one or more of these militias are gonna stand and fight, not just defense, but offense! And this statement &#8220;stated that the Barrio Azteca gang may ((authorize)) the attempted murder of law enforcement officers&#8221; should  be particularly alarming to police officers. The militias are not AUTHORIZING the murder of police officers, only foreign gangs are doing so, but who does law enforcement choose to target!! I wonder if the police officers in the line have different opinions of who their targets should be.</p>

		<p>Wow&hellip; America really has lost control of the border. You have Obamacare handing out free healthcare to illegal immigrants while at the same time the country cowers at the threats of a Mexican gang threatening to kill law enforcement agents. This is just after a Mexican gang tried to gas an entire police station.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on? Who is actually in charge here? Are the police going to actually fight back or are they going to be paralysed for fear of offending the minorities by profiling or by disrupting multiculturalism and diversity?</p>
<p>Who are the enemies here? Are they really the citizens who are tiring of being labelled as racist for wanting a crime free neighbourhood and a police force that looks after them?</p>

		<p>The Feds timing is a little suspect. They have been screaming about &#8220;conservative violent backlash&#8221; since the day after the bill was signed.<br>
Now here is a well funded group that has killed a lot of mexican police and officials and it hardly gets any notice.</p>

		<p>   The Feds pull out all stops, raid a Christian Militia (possibly with good reason, I&rsquo;ll wait and hear both sides), and it&rsquo;s all over the news.  Isn&rsquo;t this the same thing?  Nary a word about it and Big Sister doesn&rsquo;t seem to be torqued out of shape about these terrorists.</p>

<p>Seems to me that we need to deploy the military there with orders to destroy any infiltrators. This is not a law-enforcement problem.</p>
