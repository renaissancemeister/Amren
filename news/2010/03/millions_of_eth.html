<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Millions of pounds of Western aid money intended to buy food for starving Ethiopians during the country&rsquo;s 1984 famine were instead used by rebels to buy weapons, an investigation has found.</p>
<p>At least some of that money was likely to have come from the £150 million raised by Live Aid and Band Aid. More than three million copies of Do They Know It&rsquo;s Christmas sold in just five weeks in late 1984 to raise funds for the estimated eight million Ethiopians facing starvation. Up to a million died.</p>
<p>According to a report published on Wednesday, rebel soldiers disguised themselves as grain traders and handed over sacks of sand hidden beneath genuine food aid, in return for cash from Western donations.</p>
<p>The rebel army involved, headed by Ethiopia&rsquo;s current prime minister, Meles Zenawi, went on to overthrow Ethiopia&rsquo;s Marxist government and has run the country since.</p>
<p>Mr Meles has been one of Britain&rsquo;s most favoured African leaders after promising democratic reforms.</p>
<p>The investigation by the BBC, will raise further questions over Western support for Mr Meles and his ruling Ethiopian People&rsquo;s Revolutionary Democratic Front.</p>
<p>That party grew out of the Tigrayan People&rsquo;s Liberation Front, the rebel army given Western cash to buy food aid during the 1984-5 famine.</p>
<p>At the time, the Ethiopian Marxist government of Haile Mengistu Mariam refused to pass food to famine-hit civilians living in the north of the country, where a civil war was already years old and where a drought was biting hardest.</p>
<p>Instead, Europe and the US shipped food through Sudan and into the northern provinces of Tigray and Eritrea.</p>
<p>Some areas had surplus harvests, and food was bought from those farmers via a local aid group, the Relief Society of Tigray and trucked to famine-hit regions.</p>
<p>Max Peberdy, an aid worker in 1984 with Christian Aid, told the BBC that he carried more than $500,000 across the border into Ethiopia to buy food.</p>
<p>He insisted that there was &#8220;a complete separation&#8221; between cooperation from the rebel army and the &#8220;logistics&#8221; of buying food from local farmers.</p>
<p>But one of the traders who sold grain to Mr Peberdy directly, Gebremedhin Araya, said that he was in fact a senior rebel commander.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was given clothes to make me look like a Muslim merchant. This was a trick for the NGOs,&#8221; he said, referring to non-governmental organisations, or aid agencies.</p>
<p>He said sacks filled with sand were hidden under a top layer of real grain bags.</p>
<p>Another man claiming to be a senior commander, Aregawi Berhe, said that &#8220;95 per cent&#8221; of the $100 million given to buy food was diverted to purchase weapons or to boost the rebels&rsquo; cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aid workers were fooled,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Recently declassified documents from the CIA support these claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some funds that insurgent organisations are raising for relief operations, as a result of increased world publicity, are almost certainly being diverted for military purposes,&#8221; the Agency wrote in a secret 1985 report.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr Meles could not immediately be reached. A second Ethiopian government spokesman said that he had not yet seen the BBC report.<br>

		<p>Is there any surprise here? Death for one of eight due to starvation is better than 12 percent&hellip;. thats an unreal mortality rate.  In 1984 I was a mere college boy, but even then I realized that this was a scam, and that the money would be wasted. Sam Kinison had a great routine about this, and about moving to where the food is&hellip;. And all these years later, is it any better? </p>

		<p>How any of this could surprise even the dreamiest of We Are The World liberals astounds me.  This is what <i>always</i> happens to the feel-good Save The Children cash handed over to kleptocratic black regimes.  And yet the liberals, the rock stars and the groveling, misguided Christians never learn.</p>
<p><i>They would not listen; they&rsquo;re not listening, still</i></p>
<p>Perhaps they never will.</p>

<p>Speaking of Save The Children, I was watching an entertainment-style program on TV and it was interrupted by a Save The Children pledge break (for which it was raising money). The white Save The Children organizers brought onto the stage in front of a black-tie audience of 1000 a black child, no older than 8 or 9, from one of the affected countries  &mdash;  dressed in a tux. Well, this black child, rather than being embarrassed and humbled by all the attention, immediately started dancing a ghetto-style jig, as if all this glitz and glamor was the most natural thing to him in the world! Rather than thinking it adorable, I just shook my head. They can adjust so quickly to show biz, and yet put an IQ test in front of them, and they&rsquo;re hampered by &#8220;cultural bias.&#8221; We really live in an insane society.</p>

		<p>This is really old news. I have heard this since back in the 1980s. I also remember some mainstream scepticism of the &#8216;feed the world&rsquo; crusade. One article I recall described Ethiopian troops moving off to fight the Eritreans each carrying his AK-47 in one hand and his food package seized from the Western charities in the other. </p>

		<p>This same thing goes on in EVERY country the U.S. sends ANY aid to. Remember Bangledesh! we sent billions there and the &#8220;government&#8221; bought Russian Mig-21 fighters (I think about 20) BUT!! they had no pilots or airfields, they were assembled by Russian techs in a field and left to rot.((this article/expose was in a British Air magazine AIR ENTHUSIAST in the 70s to which I subscribed at the time. Think BIAFRA now, same thing, think ZIMBABWE same thing, think DETROIT, chiCONGO, D.C. same thing. STOP ALL AID TO ANYONE!</p>

<p><br>
Better Mr Zenawi as Ethiopia&rsquo;s president than the pro communist butcher Mengistu! the current gov&rsquo;t of that nation is pro western and has even used its armed forces to invade Somalia to prevent a pro Al Queda Islamic state from becoming a frighting fact, he did this with the backing of the US gov&rsquo;t and CIA.</p>

		<p>My initial foray into nigeria during the Biafran conflict in the 60&rsquo;s taught me a lot about these &#8216;aid&rsquo; rackets. The most blatant was the ample supply of milk powder in markets sold in white 2kg cans bearing a large red cross and clear &#8216;food aid&rsquo; wording. Many years in various african countries bore witness to some imaginative uses of aid packages. How about 50% of chemically treated mosquito bed nets stolen by government distributors who turned the proceeds into wedding dresses! Over many decades I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw a 20 Kg sack of rice which was not lettered &#8216;USA&rsquo;, &#8216;Red Cross&rsquo;, &#8216;Save The Children&rsquo; or something similar.  I once spent a few hours having a leaking radiator fixed in one small town and watched a school being filmed and children being fed from a field kitchen with food sacks clearly visible. After about 20 minutes, feeding was halted whilst the school name and location sign was replaced by another one, the food bags changed then the mealtime continued. This happened half a dozen times and the film crew were quite happy to brag how they would sell their footage to different aid agencies. I have never given to these &#8216;charity&rsquo; scams but have been reviled as &#8216;racist&rsquo; over the years for trying to aware others over the blatant looting. &#8216;President&rsquo; Zuma of RSA is currently in UK as guest of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and is pleading for Britain to promote soccer and relax sanctions against mugabe of zimbabwe. Anyone who watched the BBC Four documentary last night would have seen 90 minutes of total tragedy entitled &#8216;Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Forgotten Children&rsquo; which was filmed clandestinity by a Zimbabwean now living in RSA and who compared her own happy young life 10 years ago with the miserable condition of the zim children of today, all thanks to mugabe. Please don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth it to get just 5% of aid to those who really need it as they will eventually die of sickness or be hacked to death by those who stole the 95%. </p>

		<p>Should Bono or Springsteen, even get out of their limousines and try to live amongst these people (actually they never became civilized), or our idiot do gooders would cease empowering the evil ones, maybe, just maybe these fools might produce one viable nation state in a hundred years or so.  Then again I am a dreamer.</p>
<p>We have 5500 orphans in Texas and more than several high profile people go to Africa to adopt some black child.  What a useless effort on their part, and what a slap in the face to our own needs in this country.  </p>
<p>Fools.</p>

		<p>Given the fact that there are so many people in the West who try to help the Africans through donating to these agencies, it&rsquo;s sad that so much of the aid is misused or stolen. Not only is the money often used to buy weapons, let&rsquo;s not forget the palaces for dictators which have been built with humanitarian aid.</p>

		<p>As (#6) notes, it wasn&rsquo;t a total waste if the rebels used some of the aid to overthrow Col. Mengistu, the commie butcher who caused much of the starvation.</p>
<p>To their credit the liberal rock mag SPIN had a number of articles back in the 80s pointing out the charity $ was being ripped off. The p.c. crowd hasn&rsquo;t learned a thing because they have a new We Are The World remake to benefit Haiti. </p>
