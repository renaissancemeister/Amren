<h1>Accused Ga. Killer Uses Creative Legal Argument</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Bluestein, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Georgia man accused of killing two people used an innovative legal strategy Monday in an attempt to get his murder charges dismissed. Call it the Census defense.</p>
<p>Floyd Wayne Williams Jr. wants the charges dropped  &mdash;  or at least his trial delayed  &mdash;  until the 2010 Census is done so that a jury more accurately reflecting the county&rsquo;s racial makeup can be chosen. Williams, who is black, is to be tried in the south Atlanta&rsquo;s Clayton County, which has seen a surge in African-American residents since the 2000 Census.</p>
<p>Jury pools in Clayton County, like many other jurisdictions, are drawn from voter registration lists, driver&rsquo;s license data and utility records. The list is then balanced by race and gender from the Census to reflect a cross-section of the population.</p>
<p>Williams, 31, argued his constitutional rights will be violated if he is tried by a jury drawn from the 2000 Census, when the black population was 50.6 percent, instead of 2007, when the number had swelled to 64.5 percent.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in attorneys using a jury&rsquo;s racial makeup as a defense argument, in particular as Hispanic and black populations in parts of the country have swelled since the 2000 Census, said Jeffrey Abramson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law who has written a book about the role of juries.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court could soon decide whether a Michigan man&rsquo;s murder convictions should have been tossed out because there were too few black residents in a county&rsquo;s jury pool. Diapolis Smith, who is black, was convicted by an all-white jury for shooting a man in Grand Rapids in 1991.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The estimate in 2007 is more accurate than the 2000 Census. The further we get away from that, the less accurate we are,&#8221; said Christian Lamar, a Williams attorney. &#8220;And right now we know, we absolutely know, that the numbers from the 2000 Census do not reflect what we have today.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The defendant has no right to a jury that perfectly mirrors the county&rsquo;s population,&#8221; said Briones [state attorney Lalaine Briones]. &#8220;He does have a right to a jury system that does not intentionally discriminate against a group.&#8221;<br>

<p>Maybe not, but he does essentially have a right to have at least one person on the jury that is the same race as himself if he is a non-white.  All it takes is one to hang up either a conviction or the death penalty upon conviction.</p>

		<p>I have never understood the formula of a jury reflecting the makeup of its region equalling justice. Does this mean that a Black defendent convicted by a jury made up of 11 Whites and 1 Black in New Hampshire would receive justice, but a Black defendent convicted by a jury made up of 8 Blacks and 4 Whites in Atlanta would not, as the Black proportion of Atlanta is probably higher?</p>
<p>The other flaw in this reasoning is that a disproportionate number of the Black and Hispanic population would be minors who couldn&rsquo;t serve on a jury anyway, as those populations tend to have more children than Whites and Asians. So while a certain percentage of different races might reflect those above the age of consent, it would not reflect the total population counted by the Census. </p>

		<p>Black juries are the least likely to mete out justice in a race-neutral way.  This is because black ethnic identity is heavily promoted by all the powers that be.  Whites, on the other hand, are prohibited from displaying any group solidarity and so it is whites who are most likely to be impartial in a race-sensitive trial.  I don&rsquo;t think this alleged murderer is looking for an impartial jury though; he just wants it to be in his favor.</p>

		<p>The assumption is always opposite that of Dr Kings dream. The assumption is that the different groups are not equal. And generally, that everyone should show a deference, bordering on obsession, to the black racial group. </p>

<p>Therefore whites should strive to appear on juries whenever possible, and to always vote GUILTY for black defendants.</p>

		<p>The dumbest thing we&rsquo;ve ever done to ourselves, as a nation&hellip; allowing our liberal fools to get involved in our judicial and legislative areas. Like the insanity of anti-racial profiling laws&hellip; if 45% of domestic crime is by Blacks, 45% by Latinos, why in hell would looking for suspects first among our minorities be racial profiling? Ok, maybe my percentages are not necessarily exact across the board&hellip; they do depend heavily on the percentage of Blacks or Latinos in a given geographic locale&hellip; but you get the idea.</p>
