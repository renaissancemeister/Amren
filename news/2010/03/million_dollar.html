			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Schwarz, ESPN, March 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>He used to get the Garden crowd on its feet. Celtics fans could always count on 20 points and nine rebounds, and a shimmy shake on the side.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That was before the DUI in Florida 14 months ago. That was before he got busted in July in Nevada for bouncing a million dollars&rsquo; worth of checks to three Las Vegas casinos. That was before his investment properties in Chicago went south.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Walker is dressed impeccably for our television interview in New York City. Gray pinstripe suit. This is a guy who was once robbed at gunpoint of his $55,000 Rolex.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s cordial, but guarded. He has come to explain how he squandered his fortune and his reputation at warp speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you make the kind of money that I&rsquo;ve been able to make throughout my career, it should last you forever,&#8221; Walker said softly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say what disappeared more quickly: Antoine Walker&rsquo;s extraordinary basketball skills or the $110 million he earned in 13 NBA seasons.</p>
<p>Walker, who also made millions off the court peddling goods for adidas as Employee No. 8, says he is not sure how much money he has left.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all depends on how much debt I can get out of,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s lavish spending was legendary, even by NBA standards. He had closets full of custom-tailored suits. His driveway was a showroom for Benzes, Bentleys and Hummers. He never did quite appreciate just how much they depreciate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He was the millionaire who kept on giving, treating his wealthy teammates to expensive dinners and sparing no expense entertaining his entourage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walker bought a $2.5 million Chicago mansion for his mother, Diane. The house features an indoor pool, 10 bathrooms and a full-size basketball court.</p>
<p>He recently put his $3.1 million Miami home on the market. His $4.1 million downtown Chicago condo is also for sale. Walker is a motivated seller. After all, his creditors are numerous.</p>
<p>His former agent, Mark Bartelstein, won nearly $600,000 in arbitration from Walker for unpaid fees. In Illinois alone, no fewer than five financial institutions have been pursuing him for unpaid debts that, at one point, totaled nearly $7 million.</p>
<p>He also is required to make monthly child support payments of nearly $7,000 to two women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walker&rsquo;s NBA stock declined when he fell in love with the 3-point shot. His NBA fortune followed when he fell in love with craps and blackjack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a big gambler. I mean, I would bet a couple thousand dollars a hand playing blackjack. I betted big. I won big at times and I lost big.&#8221;</p>
<p>In July, Walker surrendered to authorities at Harrah&rsquo;s Casino in South Lake Tahoe, because he could not cover his losses. He was charged with bouncing 10 checks totaling a million dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maxwell [Cedric Maxwell, a former Celtics player and longtime broadcaster] saw the pattern change in 2001 when Walker spent the offseason training with Michael Jordan. He watched the two wager tens of thousands a hand at the blackjack table after a preseason game at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To avoid jail time, Walker agreed to pay back the million dollars he owes the casinos in three years.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been ordered to pay nearly $1 million in fines to the city of Chicago for violating building codes and running his apartment buildings into the ground.</p>
<p>Walker says he invested more than $10 million in investment properties in the South Side neighborhoods he knows well. He entrusted his portfolio to an old friend named Fred Billings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Billings did not pay mortgages, hired untrained workers to make illegal repairs and is awaiting trial in Cook County for his alleged involvement in a mortgage scam. He has been charged with 13 felony counts of fraud, forgery and theft.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Walker signed a maximum contract in 1999, a six-year, $71 million deal with Boston, then-Celtics president [Rick] Pitino said what everyone in the room was thinking: &#8220;[Antoine Walker] will never have to worry about money again in his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t factor in poor investments. I didn&rsquo;t factor in gambling. I didn&rsquo;t factor in recklessness of spending,&#8221; Pitino explained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} These days Walker owns two cars. He works in Puerto Rico. He plays for a team called the Guaynabo Mets, who have not guaranteed his contract beyond the end of March. At most, he can earn $150,000 in four and a half months.</p>
<p>The Mets finished 7-23 last season. They signed Walker hoping he could lead them to a championship.</p>
<p>So far, not so good. Walker is averaging 13 points per contest and leads the team with 10.6 rebounds. But Guaynabo expected more out of one of the league&rsquo;s highest-paid players.</p>

		<p>I have always thought that the war on drugs was a fraud, as it relates to our own governments toleration and/or promotion of gambling. Which is the more devasting addiction?!? This article shows us. How much marijuana can a guy smoke in one day?  Maybe&hellip;50 or 100 dollars worth? Cocaine? 500 to 1500 in a day. Contrast that with a casino&hellip; &#8220;I`ll see your fifteen grand and raise you twenty!&rsquo; That`s $35,000 dollars folks, in the time it takes to turn over a playing card.</p>

		<p>This guy is a piker compared to Obama.  His frivolous spending amounts to trillions of dollars, not millions.  And like this bald headed black basketball player, he will eventually go into bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>Before then, however, he&rsquo;ll take the country down with him and street rioting, robberies, kidnappings and all other crime will be at out-of-control levels. </p>

		<p>He is not sure how much money he has left. &ldquo;It all depends on how much debt I can get out of,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The world is handed to him on the half shell, platinum platter no less and he&rsquo;s only concerned about how much debt can he &#8220;get out of&#8221;. In other words, let somebody else suck up his debt. I would have been more than happy with 1% of what he made in 13 years of &#8220;playing&#8221; basketball. I could have lived reasonably and comfortably for the rest of my life on that 1.1 million. Come to think of it, anybody could, unless of course you&rsquo;re self-centered, greedy, foolish, irresponsible&hellip;etc.</p>

<p>Think about the amount of money we are considering here, and then ask yourself a simple question: How do you go through that kind of &ldquo;change chunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do a quick mental inventory of needs, and then answer that question in context.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself this: if you had $71 million and were going to go for a racial political victory overtime, a serious one, now how much would you spend?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say, 90% of it spent on a goal of the utmost importance; you would still be economically solvent by way $7.1 million and never have to work again, even if politics failed here! </p>

		<p>Ironically, Rick Pitino was Antoine Walker&rsquo;s college coach, at Kentucky.</p>
<p>The only conclusion to which I can arrive is that Walker is almost completely innumerate, such that any number above a literal few is a lot.  Therefore, if he signs a 6 for $71m contract, he doesn&rsquo;t understand that he goes in the red at $71,000,001 of spending.  But since 71 million seems to be above his counting threshold, he thinks he has a &#8220;lot&#8221; of money, therefore he can spend a &#8220;lot&#8221; of money.</p>

We had a guy from the Buffalo Bills who lives in the white suburb of Orchard Park (which is actually where the &#8216;Buffalo&rsquo; Bills play), who reported a robbery at his home while playing a game locally.</p>
<p>The news reported hundreds of thousands of dollars in jewelry stolen. It was an obnoxious and excessive amount for jewelry. (I remember saying at the time that anyone else could have put the money in a basic savings account and payed for an ivy league education for their children.) Since it was a white suburb, at first the blogs were speculating that it must be whites.</p>
<p>It turns out that this player went to the game and let a group of family and friends stay while he played. Nice enough gesture but a bad move none the less.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall a follow up article reporting the recovery of the jewelry or whether anyone was charged.</p>
<p>I should try a google search and ask &#8216;why can&rsquo;t black sports figures handle money&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Here is how the entire Government Corporate Machine (GCM) scam works.</p>
<p>1. The GCM identifies weak-minded humans of low intelligence (e.g., universally, Black and Brown people).</p>
<p>2. The GCM promulgates the natural characteristics, behaviors, and outcomes associated with Blacks and Browns as a colossal &#8220;poster cause&#8221; that requires intervention.</p>
<p>3. The GCM advertises the endemic plights of the Blacks and Browns and initiates a socialist call-to-action of the weak-minded, egalitarian, Marxist Whites in support of affirmative action, welfare, government health care, etc.</p>
<p>4. The government dramatically increases taxes on the responsible Whites.</p>
<p>5. The government redistributes a relatively small portion of the large tax revenues (taken from Whites!) to the Blacks and Browns. Meanwhile, Congressional members pilfer a large portion of the tax proceeds for their personal use, and give the remainder back to large corporations as kickbacks for political loyalty and support.</p>
<p>6. The large corporations ensure that the congressional members will have very lucrative consulting jobs after they leave Congress or the White House.</p>
<p>7. The Blacks and Browns take their share of the redistributed wealth and spend it all immediately, saving nothing. The money goes directly back to the GCM!</p>
<p>Result? The Blacks and Browns collectively serve as a convenient, unwitting conduit for the most elite Whites to siphon OUR money, all in the name of social good will, racial harmony, and slave reparations!!!</p>
<p>Know the truth, my friends!<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read some other versions of this story, and other similar stories through the years.  Some people who leave comments think that men that young just can&rsquo;t handle all that money dumped in their laps in one fell swoop.  Yet, almost every one of these stories about riches-to-rags professional athletes seem to have something taboo in common about the professional athlete in question.  Meanwhile, there are many white athletes who got the big payday but whose careers didn&rsquo;t turn out so well   &mdash;   They seem to be doing alright.</p>
<p>4 S &amp; GS   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t think the lottery example follows very well.  As crass and unsophisticated as it is, Antoine Walker did work for his money.  It&rsquo;s just that he spent it way faster than he earned it.</p>
<p>Also, a big problem for a lot of black pro athletes is that once they get the payday, relatives they never even knew existed pop out of the woodwork with their hands out.</p>

		<p>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?  Walker&rsquo;s plight is completely typical of black NBA players, almost all of whom are personally bankrupt just a few years after retirement.  This doesn&rsquo;t seem to happen with black baseball or football players with quite the same frequency, which would seem to indicate that the IQ requirements for those sports are rather higher.</p>
<p>Of course, the fate of black basketball players would also seem to unscore the folly of welfare for blacks in general.  The money would be far better spent on one-way first class airfare to return them to the African nation of their origins.</p>

		<p>A lot of NBA players seem to be from the ghetto or to at least have that sort of mentality.  They spend money indiscriminately, copulate recklessly, gamble addictively, and involve themselves thoughtlessly with illegal drugs, guns, and other hip-hop cultural icons.  They don&rsquo;t have the intelligence to manage even small amounts of money properly.<br/>
And, as others here have alluded, low-class blacks scam each other at every opportunity.  They live in a dog-eat-dog world  &mdash;  yet blame the white man for every ill, of course.</p>

		<p>About 12 or so years back I was reading a story about an NBA star who entered the league just out of high school.  At one point he had bought new cars for 13 of his &#8220;homies.&#8221;  I guess they were old high school buddies and neighborhood friends.  I can only assume that the cars were whatever the hip-hop scene at the time dictated they must have.  That can only mean expensive.  He also provided insurance for all 13.  That was just cars.  Hip-hop culture also dictates that these players MUST have an entourage.  They are too stupid to see each member only sees the &#8220;star&#8221; as a cash register and since they have no concept of money the register hemorrhages money faster than they can &#8220;earn.&#8221;  Naturally that lack of intelligence, common sense, and responsibility is my fault because of all those yeas I oppressed them.  </p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t just the black athletes.  MC Hammer, the superstar black rapper of the early Nineties, made over $30 million in a short time, yet wound up broke.  All that money vanished into thin air, and he owed his creditors big time.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add one thing, though.  There are white entertainers in the same boat.  Jerry Lee Lewis and Willie Nelson each owed the IRS a fortune after having made a ton of money.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with this world anyway?</p>

		<p>21 Anonymous:  Why is that his agent&rsquo;s business?  The only thing the agent needs to worry about is his or her percentage commission.  It&rsquo;s not his job to be a personal proctor for his or her clients, unless the client wants that arrangement.  Say what you want about Antoine Walker, and almost all of it would be true, but he was a grown man through this entire time frame.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Why is that his agent&rsquo;s business?&hellip;(Walker) was a grown man&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sad frequency of such cases suggests otherwise.  And while it may not be an agent&rsquo;s business it is certainly the league&rsquo;s business.  The NBA&rsquo;s pension plan, like Social Security, is based on the idea many lack adult prudence when it comes to saving and spending.  To not acknowledge and make allowances for this is to leave the public with the unsavory impression NBA players are very likely to end up discarded and destitute.</p>
<p>But then, I may have gotten it wrong.  Perhaps there is immense entertainment value in seeing &#8216;those&rsquo; people get their due.</p>

		<p>These blacks would be nobodies without foolish white team owners &amp; general managers acting as their enablers. My favorite example is Roy Tarpley, who was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks despite his known drug habit. After another drug arrest, the idiot team owner gave him a huge megabuck contract in order &#8220;to show him I care about him.&#8221; Naturally, Tarpley blew that whole wad on more drugs. Ultimately the team had to cut him loose and swallow the entire contract, because his trade value was zero.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right up your alley.  Though I should say that the percentage of potential high NFL draft picks this year using weed probably isn&rsquo;t much higher than the percentage of those in the general population who do or did use it regularly.</p>

		<p>Reply to STRIDER at #25:</p>
<p>&#8220;These blacks would be nobodies without foolish white team owners &amp; general managers acting as their enablers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make that foolish White FANS who underpin this whole rotten edifice. It utterly baffles me why so many otherwise good and decent White people will pay such good money to allow a bunch of black thugs and goons (who depise them) to make absolutely astronomical sums of money. I wouldn&rsquo;t give them a dime of my money. I also thought the (until very recently) media &#8220;hero&#8221; worship of Tiger Woods was sickening.</p>
