<h1>Shock Over Voided Puerto Rican Birth Certificates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, San Francisco Chronicle, February 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Native Puerto Ricans living outside the island territory are reacting with surprise and confusion after learning their birth certificates will become no good this summer.</p>
<p>A law enacted by Puerto Rico in December mainly to combat identity theft invalidates as of July 1 all previously issued Puerto Rican birth certificates. That means more than a third of the 4.1 million people of Puerto Rican descent living in the 50 states must arrange to get new certificates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, are U.S. citizens at birth. Anyone using a stolen Puerto Rico birth certificate could enter and move about the U.S. more easily, which could also pose security problems.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico&rsquo;s legislature passed the law after raids last March broke up a criminal ring that had stolen thousands of birth certificates and other identifying documents from several different schools in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans on average get about 20 copies of their birth certificates over their lifetimes, said Kenneth McClintock Hernandez, the commonwealth&rsquo;s secretary of state.</p>
<p>This is because they are regularly asked to produce them for such events as enrolling children in school or joining sports leagues. Schools and other institutions have typically kept copies, a practice prohibited under the new law since January, McClintock said.</p>
<p>As much as 40 percent of the identity fraud in the U.S. involves birth certificates from Puerto Rico, McClintock said he was told by the State Department.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s been growing and as the need in the black market for birth certificates with Hispanic-sounding names grew, the black market value of Puerto Rican birth certificates has gone into the $5,000 to $10,000 range,&#8221; McClintock said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has thought about what effect this could have, if any, on those of us born in Puerto Rico who now reside in the 50 states,&#8221; Serrano [Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y.,] said.</p>

<p>Again, this is one of those things that are so laughable, a four-year-old could solve the problem!</p>
<p>From the Puerto Rican &ldquo;government&rsquo;s&rdquo; perspective this is quite a logical edict; however, from the USA&rsquo;s &ldquo;governmental&rdquo; viewpoint, it should not be tolerated for a second. What we need to do (and the Puerto Ricans have handed us both the opportunity and precedent, to do it) is simple revoke any &ldquo;citizenship rights&rdquo; to Puerto Ricans, despite there &ldquo;commonwealth&rdquo; status, until they solve this problem of theirs. Moreover, since legislation dictates these things apparently, it could be written into such a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; law to include the &ldquo;more than a third of the 4.1 million people of Puerto Rican descent living in the 50 states,&rdquo; without legal Puerto Rican birth certificates as being subject to deportation. </p>
<p>It is all about perspective my friends; particularly one, not decayed by dementedly maudlin &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; worship!</p>

		<p>You mean non whites are stealing more of our stuff. Impossible. We owe it to them, therefore it&rsquo;s impossible for them to steal from us. Every unearned privilege we have that we don&rsquo;t confesses to non whites is justification for them to steal more from us.  We owe non whites everything! When they steal from us, they are helping us atone for our shameful past.</p>

<p>They are such nice people I do not beleive they would steal birth certificates.</p>
<p>I just traveled to the sanctuary town of Dover, NJ.  In a few years Americans will need a passport to visit the town of Dover.  There are so many Hispanics in Dover that the town looks and sounds like a South American town.  All the workers in the Dover Town Hall are Hispanic except the men in their 60s who are ready to retire.  </p>

		<p>My only problem with this is the possibility that it may complicate future efforts to dump Puerto Rico and give it the independence it does not want, and to give Puerto Ricans here a limited time to vacate the USA and return to their native, foreign country.  Ah well, I suppose the latter is impossible; we&rsquo;d have to give them a choice.  But we could offer them a generous cash bribe to leave and never return.  And hey, if it&rsquo;s a Mexican or Guatemalan with a fake PR birth cert wanting to cash in instead, who cares?  Bye!</p>

		<p>As a puerto rican (and a white nationalist) I&rsquo;d like to make people aware of a few things.</p>
<p>First of all.  Most puerto ricans consider themselves white.  An extremely large number of &#8220;puerto ricans&#8221; are further connected to white mainland Americans via marriage.  There are also a huge number of &#8220;puerto ricans&#8221; (myself included) who don&rsquo;t even speak spanish.</p>
<p>Puerto ricans, outside those involved in crime, tend to be conservatives, not liberals, and religious protestants (as opposed to other &#8220;hispanics&#8221; who tend to be catholic).</p>
<p>Puerto ricans absolutely despise other &#8220;hispanics&#8221;, especially south americans.  Why?  I&rsquo;ll tell you.  These people come to our neighborhoods to hide from authorities.  The fact that spanish is spoken in these neighborhoods makes it possible for them to get by, where they could never survive where only english is spoken.  This would not be such a big problem except they are all criminals.  Puerto ricans are the lions share of their victims (not that you will ever see that in any media).  From identity theft (talked about here) but also murder, rape, gangs, drug dealing on and on and on, it&rsquo;s puerto rican americans that bear the brunt of this.  So much so that puerto ricans have actually been ethnically cleansed from many places in the US (another thing you won&rsquo;t see in the media).  Just another form of &#8220;white flight&#8221;.  What can you do when your government won&rsquo;t stand by people who want to protect their communities.</p>
<p>There is no real &#8220;puerto rican&#8221; government.  Just a few leftists put into token positions by the usual white, liberal neo-communists from the mainland.  Puerto rico IS the United States.  Puerto ricans are americans.  You would be hard pressed to find a normal person from puerto rico that didn&rsquo;t identify themselves basically as a white american.  It&rsquo;s no different than say, americans of italian descent.  Sure, there are exceptions&hellip;.certain enclaves on the island.  But they are exceptions.  Also, those people are considered weirdos.</p>
<p>Puerto ricans in government, usually democrats are basically communist race traitors&hellip;.both to being white and being puerto rican.  The majority of puerto ricans are conservative, despise immigrants, love America and are patriotic&hellip;.and would never ever, ever, EVER be allowed position of any type in either party.  Those that you see are very bad, corrupt people, doing very bad things.  They were CHOSEN for that quality and are hated by normal people.  Most tend to even hide the fact that they are puerto rican, trying to pass for mexican.  Senator Bob Menendez is the classic example.  Illegal aliens with stolen identities vote for that fruitloop&hellip;.not puerto ricans.</p>
<p>Last but not least is the island is being used by neo-communist (kudos to Horrowitz for coming up with that very descriptive term) leftists as a way to ship illegals into the US&hellip;.over the objections of the people who live there and very much to their detriment.  The puerto rican &#8220;government&#8221; is not even close to being the real power behind what goes on in the island.  If the whole birth certificate thing seems a bit extreme, understand that it is a desperation move&hellip;.being done by people tired of being caught in the middle of forces trying to use our neighborhoods as a gateway to destroy the American way of life.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like it?  Vote Obama, Pelosi, Frank, and the rest of those responsible, the heck out of office.  Support groups like NumbersUSA, welfare reform, etc.  Get involved.</p>

		<p>Puerto Rico is over 60% pure European white caucasoid race from Spain where the real white Latino Hispanic is from and who founded this western hemisphere excluding the Vikings from Norway or Greenland since Greenland is already a part of North America. This rules out Leif Erricson or Eric the Red his son founding it 1000 yrs ago as is claimed since they already lived in what would be called North America after Italian explorer Americus Vespucci in 1512 who was the original European who finally figured out it was a new land and not part of Asia.</p>

Are you kidding me? I live in a northeastern city with a large Puerto Rican population and almost all look to be part Amerindian, and many also apear to be part black as well. Have you ever seen a Puerto Rican pride parade in NYC or elsewhere, the faces in the crowd certainly do not look like Spaniards from Spain! Maybe many of the PR&rsquo;s who don&rsquo;t move to the &#8220;mainland&#8221; are white, I don&rsquo;t know, but why we made them US citizens in the first place I&rsquo;ll never know. Give that island slum its independance. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but Puerto Ricans are not overwhelmingly white. They are mostly a mix of black, white and taino indians that were native to the island. Most puerto ricans neither look not sound white. I&rsquo;d say maybe 20% are white but definitely not 60%. Anyways you can always tell a puerto rican in a crowd because he&rsquo;s being loud and obnoxious or he&rsquo;s blasting Reggae-ton from his car. I&rsquo;d say most of them have a lot of black in their blood like Dominicans who are in denial about their african roots and prefer to mate with lighter people, straighten their hair and get colored contact lenses like Sammy Sosa. </p>

<p>Funny because South Americans (Not mexicans) speak better spanish not some garbled, loud, intangible version of it. You will find more White South Americans than Puerto Ricans, not just people that think they are white but are. Places like Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, parts of Brazil and in smaller numbers in Colombia, Venezuela and Peru have significant number of white people. South Americans have nothing but contempt towards Puerto Ricans in my experience. an island nation that if it weren&rsquo;t for the U.S it would be another Dominican Republic.</p>

		<p>I feel it necessary to follow up on my comments about puerto ricans.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip;.as another poster pointed out, the lions share of puerto rican racial stock is caucasoid&hellip;.specifically from spain.  Many people don&rsquo;t know that.  And the reason you don&rsquo;t know that is largely the result of how &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are portrayed in media.  There are white hispanics and there are black hispanics.  Various spanish speaking countries have a majority of one of the other (Brazil being an anomoly&hellip;..not the rule).  The two basic groups do NOT get along.  Classic example is Dominican Republic vs Haiti.  Dominicans aren&rsquo;t very white but compared to haitians they might as well be nordic.  Only a militarized border keeps the island from breaking out into a genocidal war.  Heck, the hatred is so intense (and justified I might add) that several times in the recent past, the dominicans have flirted with the idea of just wiping the haitians from the face of the earth.  Instead, they have chosen to wall them off.  They know that, in time, they will simply do it to themselves&hellip;.foriegn aid or no.</p>
<p>It is also true that many south american countries are as white or even more white than puerto ricans.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.  I&rsquo;m not trying to be insulting to south americans.  But also, don&rsquo;t miss the importance of what I am saying.  Those white hispanics aren&rsquo;t the ones coming to the US.  Instead, where they concentrate in south america, they build a nice first world existence for themselves in their own countries.  They also deal with non-whites with an iron hand that would probably shock you.  White Americans see &#8220;dangerous&#8221; non-whites coming here and forming &#8220;gangs&#8221;.  They see it as an intractible social problem.  Few understand that those people are fleeing extermination in their own countries by white &#8220;non-americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>Back to the issue with puerto ricans though.  The bottom line is that puerto ricans are white.  Non-whites who speak spanish flood into our communities and other americans are tricked by the communists responsible for the whole thing into thinking these people are puerto rican when they are not.  In the west, they are mostly mexican.  Toward the east coast, mostly from points farther south.  These problem populations are dealt with in a specific manner in those countries of origin that are not outright failed states.  Because the US is not prepared to do the same&hellip;.well, there are severe consequences to enabling them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to address the specific comment about Dover NJ.  I LIVE near the town he is talking about.  I grew up in the region.</p>
<p>Dover USED to have a small puerto rican population&hellip;.maybe 20 to 30 years ago.  These were prosperous people from New York city, that, along with most whites from the city, left due to issues of safety.  They bought homes in Dover.  Why Dover?  Because of the nice, nearby access to route 80.  Along with everyone else, these people commute every day to New York City through the George Washington Bridge or Lincoln Tunnel to go to work.  It&rsquo;s a hassle and it would be much easier to live in the city but the fact is that normal, decent, law abiding people have no place in most residential areas of the city so everyone lives in NJ, along communities that hug route 80 and commute back and forth everyday through interesting rush hour traffic&hellip;cough.  And pretend the situation is normal.</p>
<p>But something has changed in the last two decades.  The type of people I am talking about, who pretend to be puerto rican but aren&rsquo;t.  Illegals&hellip;.mostly criminals, have been bussed into these communities and put on welfare.  These people live in places like Dover and DO NOT travel to the city via route 80 every day.  They have no jobs, lol.  Instead, they spend their days selling drugs etc. and making the neighborhood toxic.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Dover ain&rsquo;t Newark or Detroit.  But it&rsquo;s not the nice normal neighborhood it was when I was a kid, either.  But here is what the former poster is obviously not aware of.  The former puerto rican population as left Dover.  The &#8220;hispanics&#8221; who live there are mostly dominicans with a healthy mix of others from all over points south of mexico.  They are non-whites.  Americans, mostly cannot tell the difference, which is a problem, in my opinion.  Because what happened in Dover is actually ethnic cleansing.  Puerto ricans (along with a very large number of other types of white people, by the way) have been ethnically cleansed out of Dover, just like they were ethnically cleansed out of New York City&hellip;&hellip;which is what caused the initial growth of the puerto rican neighborhood that was in Dover to begin with.  Unlike immigrants, puerto ricans have a tendency to cluster together, not to be near other puerto ricans but to be near FAMILY.  So what happened to the former puerto rican neighborhood in Dover?  Did it reassemble somewhere else?  No, it did not.  What it actually did was disperse.  Most of those people, along with a very large percentage of the entire state of New Jersey, I might add, actually moved to various towns in South Carolina.  So large, in fact, that if you go to South Carolina (which I do to visit friends I grew up with) there are WHOLE TOWNS where everyone speaks with a New Jersey accent and they will tell you quite directly that basically 90% of the town&rsquo;s population is from New Jersey.</p>
<p>What is that but ethnic cleansing.  Forced migration of American populations driven off by hostile third world invaders.  Understand something though.  It&rsquo;s not puerto ricans that move into a neighborhood followed by white flight.  Most people do not even notice puerto ricans in their neighborhoods except perhaps to note that their friend who they had no idea was &#8220;spanish&#8221; has a mother fluent in spanish but doesn&rsquo;t speak any himself.  Then leaves with him when those darn hispanics &#8220;from puerto rico&#8221;&hellip;..lol, move into the neighborhood and start breaking into homes, selling drugs on the street corner&hellip;.whatever.</p>
<p>These problem people specifically masquerade as us while the powers that be go out of their way to make sure nobody even really sees the tremendous differences between counterfeits and the real thing.  THAT is the issue that whites need to pay attention to.  We are being had.  That&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that puerto ricans are white.&#8221; Wrong again like I said they are mostly a mix of 3 races white, black and taino. I&rsquo;m sure there a few real white people there but the rest are a-la Sammy Sosa. I give credit for Ricky Martin or Benicio del Toro as white but not Rosie Perez or Erik Estrada.</p>
<p>&#8220;Non-whites who speak spanish flood into our communities&#8221;<br>
you mean other puerto ricans who are more in tune with black culture and hip-hop like daddy yankee and all those reggae-ton loving fools? Afro-Ricans is the right term.</p>
<p>In the U.S white hispanics are not a visible minority because they are white and prefer to be closer to white americans rather than to other &#8220;Latinos&#8221; You don&rsquo;t see them move here but they do legally and often want nothing to do with La Raza, and other mestizo people.</p>

		<p>Pueto Rico is not the problem, it is our failure to protect our borders and instill pride in being American.  Yes, there are many Puerto Ricans who do not consider themselves American, despise America and want independence.  Then there are the PRs who are proud to be American.  But like all Americans the pro-America types are not allowed to speak.  When someone yells &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;natavist&#8221; we go on the defensive.  We should shout traitor, but we doubt.  PR is a symptom, not the disease.</p>
<p>PS - I am NOT Puerto Rican.<br>

		<p>Anyone who thinks Puerto Ricans are mostly White (and/or of largely White background) is either a fool or lying to themselves. It is just not true. In any case America has never gained anything from possession of the island. It has neither been Anglicized or converted to being English-speaking. America has had to absorb over a third of the island&rsquo;s excess (and poor) population. Puerto Ricans who came to America, have, as a group, accomplished very little. Having had access to the United States since 1917, Puerto Ricans have played a role in conditioning Americans to non-White immigration. They have engaged in numerous actions of political terrorism against Americans. In 1950 P.R. terrorists came within an inch of asassinating the president. Economically the island is a drag on America and this is unlikely to ever change. The island should just be given its independence (whether it wants it or not). We don&rsquo;t need another Hawaii - one that is even poorer, of no strategic value and doesn&rsquo;t even speak English.</p>

		<p>From the movie &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke, <br>
You gotta understand, <br>
It&rsquo;s just our bringin&rsquo; up-ke <br>
That gets us out of hand. <br>
Our mothers all are junkies, <br>
Our fathers all are drunks. <br>
Golly Moses, natcherly we&rsquo;re punks! </p>
<p>ACTION AND JETS <br>
Gee, Officer Krupke, we&rsquo;re very upset; <br>
We never had the love that ev&rsquo;ry child oughta get. <br>
We ain&rsquo;t no delinquents, <br>
We&rsquo;re misunderstood. <br>
Deep down inside us there is good! </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
There is good! </p>
<p>ALL <br>
There is good, there is good, <br>
There is untapped good! <br>
Like inside, the worst of us is good! </p>
<p>SNOWBOY: (Spoken) That&rsquo;s a touchin&rsquo; good story. </p>
<p>ACTION: (Spoken) Lemme tell it to the world! </p>
<p>SNOWBOY: Just tell it to the judge. </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
Dear kindly Judge, your Honor, <br>
My parents treat me rough. <br>
With all their marijuana, <br>
They won&rsquo;t give me a puff. <br>
They didn&rsquo;t wanna have me, <br>
But somehow I was had. <br>
Leapin&rsquo; lizards! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so bad! </p>
<p>DIESEL: (As Judge) Right! </p>
<p>Officer Krupke, you&rsquo;re really a square; <br>
This boy don&rsquo;t need a judge, he needs an analyst&rsquo;s care! <br>
It&rsquo;s just his neurosis that oughta be curbed. <br>
He&rsquo;s psychologic&rsquo;ly disturbed! </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
I&rsquo;m disturbed! </p>
<p>JETS <br>
We&rsquo;re disturbed, we&rsquo;re disturbed, <br>
We&rsquo;re the most disturbed, <br>
Like we&rsquo;re psychologic&rsquo;ly disturbed. </p>
<p>DIESEL: (Spoken, as Judge) In the opinion on this court, this child is depraved on account he ain&rsquo;t had a normal home. </p>
<p>ACTION: (Spoken) Hey, I&rsquo;m depraved on account I&rsquo;m deprived. </p>
<p>DIESEL: So take him to a headshrinker. </p>
<p>ACTION (Sings) <br>
My father is a bastard, <br>
My ma&rsquo;s an S.O.B. <br>
My grandpa&rsquo;s always plastered, <br>
My grandma pushes tea. <br>
My sister wears a mustache, <br>
My brother wears a dress. <br>
Goodness gracious, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a mess! </p>
<p>A-RAB: (As Psychiatrist) Yes! <br>
Officer Krupke, you&rsquo;re really a slob. <br>
This boy don&rsquo;t need a doctor, just a good honest job. <br>
Society&rsquo;s played him a terrible trick, <br>
And sociologic&rsquo;ly he&rsquo;s sick! </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
I am sick! </p>
<p>ALL <br>
We are sick, we are sick, <br>
We are sick, sick, sick, <br>
Like we&rsquo;re sociologically sick! </p>
<p>A-RAB: In my opinion, this child don&rsquo;t need to have his head shrunk at all. Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease! </p>
<p>ACTION: Hey, I got a social disease! </p>
<p>A-RAB: So take him to a social worker! </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
Dear kindly social worker, <br>
They say go earn a buck. <br>
Like be a soda jerker, <br>
Which means like be a schumck. <br>
It&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;m anti-social, <br>
I&rsquo;m only anti-work. <br>
Gloryosky! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a jerk! </p>
<p>BABY JOHN: (As Female Social Worker) <br>
Eek! <br>
Officer Krupke, you&rsquo;ve done it again. <br>
This boy don&rsquo;t need a job, he needs a year in the pen. <br>
It ain&rsquo;t just a question of misunderstood; <br>
Deep down inside him, he&rsquo;s no good! </p>
<p>ACTION <br>
I&rsquo;m no good! </p>
<p>ALL <br>
We&rsquo;re no good, we&rsquo;re no good! <br>
We&rsquo;re no earthly good, <br>
Like the best of us is no damn good! </p>
<p>DIESEL (As Judge) <br>
The trouble is he&rsquo;s crazy. </p>
<p>A-RAB (As Psychiatrist) <br>
The trouble is he drinks. </p>
<p>BABY JOHN (As Female Social Worker) <br>
The trouble is he&rsquo;s lazy. </p>
<p>DIESEL <br>
The trouble is he stinks. </p>
<p>A-RAB <br>
The trouble is he&rsquo;s growing. </p>
<p>BABY JOHN <br>
The trouble is he&rsquo;s grown. </p>
<p>ALL <br>
Krupke, we got troubles of our own! </p>
<p>Gee, Officer Krupke, <br>
We&rsquo;re down on our knees, <br>
&#8216;Cause no one wants a fellow with a social disease. <br>
Gee, Officer Krupke, <br>
What are we to do? <br>
Gee, Officer Krupke, <br>
Krup you! <br>
