			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government has singled out the Los Angeles Unified School District for its first major investigation under a reinvigorated Office for Civil Rights, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The focus of the probe, by an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, will be whether the nation&rsquo;s second-largest district provides adequate services to students learning English.</p>
<p>Officials turned their attention to L.A. Unified because so many English learners fare poorly and because they make up about a third of district enrollment, more than 220,000 students.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Federal analysts will review how English learners are identified and when they are judged fluent enough to handle regular course work. They&rsquo;ll examine whether English learners have qualified, appropriately trained teachers. And they&rsquo;ll look at how teachers make math and science understandable for students with limited English.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of federal officials is to exert pressure on L.A. Unified and other school districts to close the achievement gap that separates white, Asian and higher-income students from low-income, black and Latino students. </p>
<p>Federal authorities aren&rsquo;t accusing L.A. Unified of intentional discrimination, but the civil rights office seeks to uncover policies and practices that result in a &#8220;disparate outcome.&#8221; Enforcement options include withholding federal money; more than 23% of the district&rsquo;s $7.16 billion operating budget comes from the federal government.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan launched the ramped-up enforcement effort Monday at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., where law enforcement officers beat and drove back 600 civil rights marchers on March 7, 1965. Without naming school systems, officials said 38 faced compliance reviews; on Tuesday it became clear that L.A. Unified was among them.</p>
<p>Some observers hailed a resurgent civil rights office they said had languished under the George W. Bush administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In L.A., second grade is the apparent high-water mark for English learners. At that level, 33% test as proficient in English. By eighth grade, proficiency levels decline to 2%, although that includes recent immigrants and excludes students who have moved into the &#8220;fluent&#8221; category. But even among newly fluent students, only 35% test as academically proficient in English in the 11th grade.</p>
<p>Language problems ultimately contribute to high dropout rates as well as the inability of many graduates to complete college and compete for jobs, researchers say. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In other districts, the division also will look at equal access to college-prep classes, equal opportunity for African American students, sexual harassment, violence and services to the disabled.<br>

<p>This is one of the very rare times when races other than black and white are discussed in the achievement gap.  However, there is also one between Hispanics and blacks, though they are placed together here.</p>

<p>I think this is indicative of the brain development racial differences that Rushton writes about.  It&rsquo;s the same reason why Head Start seems to work for black children, because HS is applied to black children at the time in their lives when they&rsquo;re ahead of whites in brain development.  But by about 10 years old, they level off.<br>

		<p>With only approximately 10% of the Los Angeles Unified School District students being white they are not statistically significant anymore.  In a few more years they will be in the low single digits. </p>
<p>So no more whites students, no more gap, problem solved!</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t believe this report, which refers mostly to Hispanics (MesoAmericans, largely from Mexico).  In L.A., many schools are primarily Hispanic.  Thus, these students are surrounded by people who &#8220;look like them.&#8221;  Thus (according to current diversity theory), they should be excelling (We all know that the reason Minorities fail is that there aren&rsquo;t enough people around who look like them).  Ergo, the report is in error.  </p>
<p>As massive illegal immigration from Mexico continues, an even greater percentage of LA students will come to &#8220;look like them.&#8221;  Hence, any existing problem will be solved.  So, there is really nothing that needs to be done at this time   &mdash;   the problem is sure to take care of itself. </p>

<p>And they are not investigating minority white students living in fear and under siege, and disparaged, by both the other students and to a greater degree by the &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; curriculum itself?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s things like this that make you stare in disbelief, mouth agape.</p>
<p>In LA the students are not becoming proficient in English because:</p>
<p>#1 The majority of the students now are from Spanish-speaking backgrounds and there are few native English speaking kids for them to interact with.</p>
<p>#2  The majority of the Students speak Spanish as their first language, as do their parents, the people in their neighborhood, the majority of radio stations - even the TV is in Spanish there now.</p>
<p>#3  A huge number of workers and teachers in the LA school district are latino and speak Spanish mostly.  </p>
<p>#4  Everywhere those kids go - to the store, to the park, to their neighborhood - everyone is speaking Spanish.  </p>
<p>So what god awful enlightening truth will some stupid investigation reveal?  LA and much of southern California is an outpost of Mexico now.  In 20 years, Spanish will be an official language of the U.S. and it won&rsquo;t matter any more.</p>

		<p>In theory the federal Office of Civil Rights is supposed to investigate cases of minorities being discriminated against. However, in this case the Hispanic &#8220;victims&#8221; are from the majority group who runs the city!</p>
<p>If anything, they should be checking on how whites, blacks and Asians are being treated but since they hate whites w/every fiber of their being that will never happen. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve taught school in the L.A. County area, and the fact is, Hispanic kids don&rsquo;t learn English because they are not encouraged to by their parents at home.  They&rsquo;re in school for 6 hours 5 days a week - that&rsquo;s 30 hours.  The rest of the time they are speaking Spanish at home and watching Spanish TV ON SATELLITE (which most of them have, although they&rsquo;re all on the free breakfast and lunch programs at school).  So it&rsquo;s 30 hours of English per week, and about 84 hours of Spanish (waking hours at home)- per week.  DO THE MATH, FOLKS!!  I know this is true from my own experience teaching in an Ontario barrio.  There is no &#8220;disparate condition&#8221; responsible - it&rsquo;s the attitude of the first generation Hispanic families that discourage their own kids from learning English.  Not only that, but the mothers of these kids did not receive adequate nutrition during pregnancy, and the kids themselves were not fed balanced, nutritious food during their first 5 years of life; with those 2 conditions, there is no way the kids&rsquo; brains could develop anywhere near as well as those of children who were adequately fed and whose mothers ate appropriately during their pregnancy.  This cannot be caught up or fixed - it&rsquo;s a permanent inferiority.  All we tried to do was to get our kids up to the highest level that THEY could achieve   &mdash;   which was far below the level of kids in white or Asian areas.  And it always will be below - because of the factors named above.</p>

<p>Especially relevant because this is California we&rsquo;re discussing, the state&rsquo;s current elected Education Secretary, Jack O&rsquo;Connell, said out and outright a few years ago that white teachers are specifically to blame for black and Hispanic underachievement.  </p>

		<p>Are the students &#8220;required&#8221; to learn english?  If so, this in itself is a violation of the very &#8220;civil rights&#8221; the Barry Jermyn administration is so keen on protecting.  As far as I know, english is not the official language of california at this time, and requiring anyone to learn how to do anything in english would seem to be to be an illegal intrusion at both the state and federal level.  If the federal government wants to require anyone to learn english, let them declare it the official language of the United States.  Otherwise, butt the hell out and quit doing harm to these poor mexicans who simply want to speak their native tongue in peace, fornicate and drive vehicles while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.  Quit messing with the poor law abiding dears.</p>

		<p>10 Question Diversity<br>
     Sometime in the past year, Calif education boss Jack O&rsquo;Connell said that the problem of Black and Mexican failure was not genetic.  That shows that he knows it&rsquo;s genetic.  Why else would he make a point of it?  No public figure or organization had said any such thing, so he was responding to something he heard privately.  I&rsquo;d bet that education big shots sit around and discuss how to disguise the truth with each other directly.  They might even use common racial slurs, and laugh about how stupid Whites are to believe that races are equal.  <br>
     Teacher training is all about &#8220;English Learners&#8221; (Mexicans) and &#8220;Learning Disabled&#8221; (Blacks) these days.  If they want to drive White teachers and students out of the LA schools,the Whites should be happy to go. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve scoured Rushton&rsquo;s opinions on the differences between whites and blacks up to age ten, and the only thing I&rsquo;ve found on the subject is that he is pointing out what about a hundred other researchers have and that is there is an achievement gap between whites and blacks, with blacks behind just as they are throughout their entire lives.  In fact, he mentions that blacks are behind whites in kindergarten.</p>
<p>Can you clarify your assertion?  Can you offer references as to what you are saying?</p>

		<p>I live in LA and the incompetence and corruption of LAUSD is epic.  It&rsquo;s certainly no secret.  It&rsquo;s an absolutely unholy alliance of minority race hustlers and clueless white liberals.  Meanwhile all thinking individuals - teachers and students - have fled to private schools or the exurbs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total black hole.  What is never talked about is the fact that they&rsquo;re entrusted with an impossible task - bringing blacks and hispanics up to a reasonable standard of learning.  To acknowledge this would endanger the money flows, which are considerable.  However, the tax base of LA is rapidly shrinking due to fleeing whites and asians who are none too pleased with paying for two sets of schools - one set for their own kids, and one for the third-world future of LA.  </p>
<p>With that in mind, this &#8220;investigation&#8221; will no doubt recommend ever-greater infusions of federal cash to &#8220;correct&#8221; what they deem to be intolerable practices at LAUSD.  We all know what the reality will be under that high-sounding rhetoric.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;They&rsquo;re in school for 6 hours 5 days a week - that&rsquo;s 30 hours. The rest of the time they are speaking Spanish at home and watching Spanish TV ON SATELLITE&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jay:</p>
<p>This is so true.</p>
<p>Except I would add that most have illegal cable hook-ups, not paid-for satellite TV, although I do see a fair number of satellite dishes on top of Section 8 housing projects that I must pass every day  &mdash;  kids at school tell me they can get 100 &#8216;free&rsquo; channels by tapping into the cable lines.  They also tell me they&rsquo;ve done this for years and years and have never been caught.  I have no doubt this is true.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the cable line-up in LA shows the massive number of cable stations that are strictly in Spanish  &mdash;  further down the line are the black channels, and then Asian-language, Middle Eastern and Eastern European channels  &mdash;   all of which are replacing English-language channels.</p>
<p>It burns me up that I have to pay for channels I cannot watch  &mdash;   and am not interested in.  I am not allowed a menu from which to choose the channels I wish to pay for  &mdash;  if I were, those foreign language channels would be out of business by the end of the day.</p>
<p>What is not mentioned about the low performance of hispanics, besides their low IQs of 85-90, is their disinterest and in many cases hostility toward school.  So many are raised completely on fat entitlements (that are drying up here) that they believe they deserve and little understand (or care) how they are paid for. </p>
<p>Very few hispanic students, in my 20+ years of teaching, are focused, dedicated, willing or desirous to study, do homework, or are driven enough to succeed.  Most sort of muddle through, doing as little as possible to get by.  They do not enjoy reading or math, do not read at home and tell me it bores them.  Most have reading levels between third and fifth grade and little improve in four years.</p>
<p>Their failures and abysmal tests scores, of course, are blamed on White teachers, those who do not look like them, and from whom they cannot learn,  so they say.  What they don&rsquo;t get (except the brighter ones) is that hispanic teachers are only a little above the students they teach  &mdash;  if they are at all. </p>
<p> Many have gone to state colleges that specialize in churning out non-White teachers, been shoved through to keep the activists off their back and fill quotas, and majored in hispanic studies or revisionist history  &mdash;  the only things they could pass.  I&rsquo;ve found their levels of education to be atrocious, their grammar wholly lacking, their knowledge of anything they teach woefully inadequate. But they are well-versed in marxist ideals, especially those of che guevara and fidel castro.</p>
<p>As for the school being broke or chocked of money by the state:</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve noticed a huge change in the &#8216;free&rsquo; breakfasts and lunches the students receive.  Free Breakfast now consists of a slab of stale coffee cake  &mdash;  carefully counted out, one per student, with any leftovers pulled back, no seconds on anything  &mdash;  a very small container of milk (often strawberry or chocolate  &mdash;  the &#8216;flavoring&rsquo; used to dilute the milk)  in a plastic-bag type container, maybe two very small, very greasy sausages and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>A year or two ago, there was brand-name yogurt and/or cereal to choose from, as much milk as the students wanted, brand-name juices  &mdash;  either orange or apple, cottage cheese, often good-sized omelets with cheese and bacon.  On Fridays pizza arrived from the local pizza parlor.</p>
<p>Kids also tell me &#8216;free&rsquo; medical is becoming stingier  &mdash;  fewer services are provided, longer waits, fewer &#8216;free&rsquo; medicines offered.  One kid told me his family received a list when they entered the clinic as to what specific medical procedures and drugs are or are not required by law for the clinic to provide to the undocumented.</p>
<p>This is as it should be.</p>
<p>The only problem is, this large class is used to receiving complete services for everything without question, housing, food, free breakfasts and lunches, free medical  &mdash;  and has been receiving entitlements for four decades now, generation after generation.</p>
<p>They will not be happy when these services are cut off, but these services are and will be curtailed further as productive Whites are pushed out of the state and more people from the Third World are welcomed. </p>
<p>Keep an eye on what is happening in California.  I think it could turn ugly very quickly, the signs are certainly there.</p>
