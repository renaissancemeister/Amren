			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>UPI, March 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama has met with two senators in an attempt to revive an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, people familiar with the discussions said.</p>
<p>During the meeting earlier this week, Obama and his Domestic Policy Council outlined ways to advance the effort with Sens. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who have worked jointly for months to craft a bill, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.</p>
<p>A person knowledgeable about the meeting said the White House may ask Schumer and Graham to try to develop a blueprint that could become a bill.</p>
<p>Provisions would include a path toward U.S. citizenship for the approximately 10.8 million people living in the country illegally, the White House said. {snip}</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there already IS a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; for these alien invaders:</p>
<p>1.  Leave the US and return to their home countries.<br>
2.  Apply for Green Cards the legal way.<br>
3.  Wait and hope the way legal immigrants do.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, the blame rests with the gullible white voters every time they allow people in office who do not have their best interests in mind.</p>
<p>Lindsey Graham is a good example.  The people re-elected him in spite of his atrocious propensity to support radical leftist causes like unchecked immigration.  The ones who elected him this time had plenty of forewarning as to his proclivities to favor non-white hordes, yet whites voted him in again.  Now, he&rsquo;s right back at it, trying to get his pet programs through in spite of the fact that they are tremendously detrimental to whites and white interests in this country.</p>
<p>Obama is another good example of naive, do-gooder white fools who are aiding in causing their own demise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the country is on the way out, quite frankly. It&rsquo;s too messed up to ever set straight again.  It isn&rsquo;t possible.  Until whites separate the fools from everybody else, they will continue to go down hill as they have for four hundred years, beginning with the ones who wanted to be &#8220;fair&#8221; to the indians who set about butchering them in an attempt to wipe them out to the last woman and child.</p>

		<p>Obviously any amnesty law that makes it easier for the illegals to become legal than the usual process for hopeful immigrants will only provide positive reinforcement for Mexicans to cross over illegally resulting in an even greater influx from Mexico. Everyone understands this, including politicians, but this amnesty is just a sellout opportunity (at US citizen&rsquo;s expense) for politicians to get a large share of the Mexican American vote. This sellout should be fought. </p>

How about thirty million? That seems to be a more accurate figure.<br>

		<p>If amnesty is granted to the 12 million,, or 10.8 million, or whatever the number may be,  something is being completely ignored. Within milliminutes of such legislation being passed, the next tsunani wave of illegals will be heading our way for the next in the wave of serial amnesties. </p>

		<p>Even though it was before my time, I read that when Kennedy was supporting the immigration act of 1964(?) that he said it wouldn&rsquo;t result in millions of immigrants flooding our cities.  So that is a provable mis-prediction.  Shouldn&rsquo;t the libs be called out on that?  I wonder why no conservatives take that line, because the libs are saying we needs lots of immigrants to support aging white retirees, but if 50% of all immigrants are on public assistance, perhaps permanently, won&rsquo;t those retirees eventually get shafted anywhay?</p>

		<p>Yes, we need immigration reform. We need to start enforcing our immigration laws. We need e-verify for jobs and welfare benefits, we need to get rid of the anchor baby provision, we need to close our southern border. We need to force these illegals back to their home country. We need to do the will of the American people, the majority who want illegal immigration done away with and legal immigration severely reduced. In these harsh economic times, we need NO immigration.</p>

		<p>Let Obama and his lackies on the left and right try it.</p>
<p>They may succeed, but in the process millions of whites are going to find out what is actually important to the two parties - cheap labor, race replacement and raw political pandering. There isn&rsquo;t any way to spin it as something that will benefit most white people or as something that white people want.</p>
<p>Win or lose, amnesty/immigration reform is the best opportunity to awaken white racial consciousness in this country.</p>

		<p>It makes little sense to believe illegal immigrants are being thought of only as cheap labor and future votes. The invasion of the United States is quite similar to that of Europe but I am not aware of anyone claiming it is to attract votes in Europe.The reason is plain and simple, the destruction of White Western civilization.Only the White nations of the world are being forced against their will to not only accept hostile invaders but to pay the bill in the process.You can also forget the argument about &#8220;doing jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; because millions of Americans did those jobs before the illegal invasion and millions would do them now.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the immigration mess is entirely an issue focused on cheap labor by greedy corporations or vote-seeking democrats. This current drive at flooding America with newly minted citizens from the millions of illegals is being driven by Obama, using his influence to get clueless black supporters and various left-wing interest groups on board. </p>
<p>By electing Obama the nation ironically got a president of the United States with no sense of the United States. With the unusual background of his parents, the African influence, a childhood partly spent half-way around the world and surrounded by muslims, Obama has no perspective on America as a nation and no feeling for its history and foundations. </p>
<p>I think he sees the country as just another place on the map that has lots of food and goodies and handouts, courtesy of the evil white folks who probably stole everything anyway, and thus everyone should just come on in and enjoy - especially people of color. In his mind, it&rsquo;s another way of spreading the wealth around.</p>
<p>In light of the economy and other mounting strains on the US, any reasonable person would see the massive dangers inherent in the immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; policy he supports. It is destructive to America. However, I don&rsquo;t think he cares because he has no sense of America. He apparently lacks any feeling or shows any understanding as it relates to those who came before him - the people who built the foundation for this country and developed its guiding principles. If he did then we wouldn&rsquo;t be having this debate to begin with.</p>
<p>His election - which to this day I still cannot understand - is an insult to all of the effort expended here since 1776.</p>

		<p>Nick Shapiro, a White House spokesman, said the president&rsquo;s support for an immigration bill, which would also include improved border security, was &#8220;unwavering.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Yeah riiiight. They can&rsquo;t even finish building a fence NOW, and they expect us to believe this nonsense?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure why we are fighting two wars to keep &#8220;terrorists&#8221; from attacking us, when they won&rsquo;t even keep unwanted illegals from strolling right through our back door. These wars are supposed to be about keeping America safe right? That is starting to sound absurd considering our border situation, so I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder why we are really in the Middle East? </p>
<p>Can anyone help me out on this one?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so very sad to see the once greatest country in the world throw in the towel to the millions of low-skilled, poorly educated, crime-ridden millions who pour across our border at will. There has been no President since Dwight Eisenhower who possessed the courage to say &#8220;go home!&#8221; They do not have mighty armies, nor powerful weapons to destroy a country. They have done it by sheer numbers. And they have been eagerly aided and abetted by out politicians, greedy businesses and anti-American organizations. Seems to come down to votes and payoffs. But our esteemed leaders ignore one thing. The true motive is to &#8220;fundamentally change&#8221; this nation into a third world horror. Know what? They are succeeding because we keep sending the traitors back to Washington.</p>

		<p>Commenter #1 Scott should know something most Americans don&rsquo;t realize but upon deeper consideration becomes axiomatic.  The goverment bueracrats are corrupt outside the country as well as within.</p>
<p>State dept &#8220;civil serpents&#8221; overseas are a large part of our immigration debacle that go un-noticed.  They are often bought off, hide behind the &#8220;mushroom treatment&#8221; for immegrees, and (it seems) generally avoid what must be sensible solutions to head off illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The solution is easy:</p>
<p>1. Get rid of &#8220;do gooder&#8221; bleeding hearts in government (Ha Ha lol).</p>
<p>2. Work on increasing US birth rates to stem the need for immigration (this requiers political manuvering to dis-empower the over-population kooks [keepers of odd knowledge].  Note: the entire population of the world can be fit into the city limits of Jacksonville, Florida&hellip;TWICE!</p>
<p>Conclution:</p>
<p>Peoples obvious and honorable desire to get away from corrupt regimes and bannana republics is admirable.  Religion, race, and culture play a large part of their problems and we can lead by example to provide solutions for them.  Never-the-less, let&rsquo;s take their best and brightest.  Our caution should be that our economy and culture will not stand for long if we allow Indians, Chinese (chi-coms), et al to come here and work as engineers and technocrats for pennies on the dallar of what professional Americans wage for.</p>

		<p>When I look around my neighborhood, whites make up about 10% of the population here.  When I drive to work, I see no whites at all for 20 minutes.  When I&rsquo;m at work, over three quarters of the teaching staff is white, while ALL of the students and the entire administration (including secretaries, etc) are non-white.  (I gues the majority-minority still has trouble getting people through college.)</p>
<p>The white teachers are divided into those over 30 who remember how America was, and those under 30 who eat, sleep and exude &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and &#8216;protests to support the disadvantaged.&rsquo;  They have no content knowledge to speak of, and frame their mini-bite lessons through the lense of &#8220;injustice&#8221; and &#8220;protest.&#8221;  Even in math classes.  Any black teachers use their classes, whatever the subject, as a civil rights rap session.  Some latino teachers are sincere, but others just &#8216;fiesta&rsquo; with their students.</p>
<p>When I step out for lunch, I see no whites, anywhere.  All I see are latina women pushing baby carts - all over the place!  There&rsquo;s a handful of asians in the area where I work, but they ignore the latinos and walk as if they have blinders on. There is no feeling of community there. There is no one like me.  I am the minority.</p>
<p>When I go home, again, I see no whites on the sidewalks or in any cars I pass.  Once in a while, I&rsquo;ll see a lone white woman walking or an old man.  I pause for thought and ponder.  What was it like here 50 years ago?</p>
<p>I grew up in a 99.9999 percent white town in the midwest that was over half an hour&rsquo;s drive away from any non-white areas.  When I go back to visit, I now see gangbangers walking down the tiny main street.  What are they there for?  What is there for them to do?</p>
<p>On my mother&rsquo;s lake, I saw quite a few voodoos at the local beach.  I had never seen that before.  I saw white girls hanging off of them like they were boy toys.  The things I saw last time I visited were so incongruous.  I had dreams of returning there some day when I could escape the multicultural paradise I am currently suffering in.  Now even my place of refuge is no more.</p>
<p>Where will I go?  I am a minority now in a country that is undergoing a demographic invasion.  I do not believe my government when they say that whites are still 75% of the population.  I know they count Arabs, North Africans, Indo-Paks, Central Asians, Gypsies, Dominicans and a hundered other groups in that figure.  The only white &#8216;places&rsquo; I encounter now are when I drive in rural areas or the few untouched suburbs that can be found here and there, but I know that is about to change, also.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for the civilization of my ancestors?  What will the lot of people like me be when non-whites are 75% of the population?  Will they respect the Constitution, or use the three branches of government to continuously &#8216;empower&rsquo; their people, like they try to do now, until my people are powerless?  I&rsquo;m afraid I already know the answers to my own questions.</p>

		<p>I think we need a strategy that understands that mass immigration can be a positive good, under very specific circumstances. If we did not have the current system of federal and state welfare, unrestricted immigration would be  a positive good for the country. I would predict a return to what we once had - a self regulating flow in and out of the country of low skilled labor.</p>
<p><br>
I will surprise readers here by saying that unrestricted immigration was once a good thing for the United States - at a time when the various welfare programs, state and federal, did not exist. In that event, each immigrant paid his own way.  Pre WWI, there was much immigration, but also much emigration, as those who could not make it here, or did not plan to remain here permanently, left.</p>
<p>A mass immigration of unskilled labor will tend to reduce the over all price of all labor.  Not only did the increased supply of unskilled labor lower the price of those who were already in the country, but it also lowers the price of the labor cohorts above it, by inducing a substitution effect. In many cases &#8216;one the margin&rsquo; as economist like to say, there was incentive to substitute  unskilled labor for skilled labor.</p>
<p>This last is an important point in understanding the economic impact of  immigration. If, for example, the current population of illegal immigrants were no longer present, the jobs they occupy currently would NOT go back to the remaining population one for one.  The reduced   supply of unskilled labor would tend to raise its price. In turn, this would induce employers of labor to substitute capital for labor. This would increase demand for skilled labor, whose price would tend to rise.</p>
<p>I would also note the economic impact of abortion. If you see who gets the abortions, the majority are to the poorer people. Thus,in legalizing abortion, we have reduced the supply of native-born unskilled labor. It is no accident we began to see the dramatic rise of illegal immigration about twenty years after Roe vs Wade - i/e. early 1990s. The illegal immigration was, I suggest, at least partly driven by the self-imposed reduction of our own unskilled labor force created by the aborting of tens of millions of potential laborers. This created a resource shortfall in that commodity. The rest of the story we know. Mind, I am not making an argument for or against abortion here; I am focusing only on economic impact.</p>
<p>As long as we have our current system of federal and state subsidization of of unemployment and unmarried pregnancy, we cannot afford mass immigration of low-skilled labor. I also believe that we are more likely to see consensus in this country around illegal immigration than we are for the abolition of the welfare system. When you consider than three quarters of  what  welfare program expense goes to overhead, and not delivery of service, you have a constituency in favor of its continuation  - specifically the labor unions whose members work in those programs. I think an illegal immigration reduction program is more likely to succeed than any effort to reduce welfare in the short term. Also, a reduction in illegal immigrants will tend to reduce the load on welfare programs - in effect a reduction of social welfare expenditure.</p>
<p>I would suggest that we first focus on the economic incentives for illegal immigration. This would include measures such as prohibition of public assistance to all non-citizens, mandatory audits of all employers for the immigration status of their laborers. I would also reward informers who provide accurate information on the use of illegal labor by employers. It believe this would be far more productive that the current system of intermittent raids, and futile efforts to build &#8216;electronic fences&rsquo;. The MacNamara Line of similar concept did not work in Vietnam, and I doubt whether the same approach would prove more valuable  here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my $-\0.02; if you don&rsquo;t like my opinion, then you must get one of your own.</p>
<p>I thank AR for providing this forum for opinion. AR has proving that the least liberty is to be expected from those you yelp the loudest of tolerance.</p>

		<p>Dear Once Great Nation of America.</p>
<p>What are you doing to your nation? Amnesty for illegal immigrants, mainly 3rd world  will simply open the floodgates totally!</p>
<p>This will certainly leave white Americans in the minority. Then with the printing of trillions of dollars worth of money, an Afro-American president, a &#8220;free&#8221; health care system and bogged down in a pointless Middle East war you are now on your own downhill slide to be part of the 3rd world.</p>
<p>Wake up America before it is too late.</p>

<p>War is a BUSINESS, nothing more or less to America BUT! it is more than that to the muslims. The muslims take war as the Romans did in the Punic Wars. Carthage and Rome fought 3 wars for various reasons and when they were no longer profitable in the view of a Merchant run Carthaginian government they wanted out, BUT! the Romans made it and matter of Roman honor and continued it willing to break the Roman world to win..They did win, totally destroyed Carthage and salted the plains on which it had stood for hundreds of years. The muslims take this war the same way as the Romans while we, in America, are looking at it in a Carthagenian profit/loss manner and I fear the same thing will happen to us.</p>

<p>I have a complete set of &#8216;Dick and Jane&rsquo; elementary readers, used extremely effectively in the US K-12, for about 40 years. I also have a McGuffy Reader that was used to educate children in the early part of the last century.  You can be sure a lot of the reading was based lessons from the Bible, especially The Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>I also collect high school texts (which I obtain for free as these days they are considered racist trash and slated for destruction  &mdash;  inside is marked &#8216;Discard!&rsquo; in large black letters)  &mdash;   one 10th grade text has tissue-thin paper, few illustrations or pictures and reading material not dumbed down.  The questions at the end of each selection call for analytical, high-order thinking;  extrapolation, inference, deduction and prediction  &mdash;  replete with demands for a long student essay analyzing the entire work.</p>
<p>There is a long selection about Robert E. Lee including letters he wrote to his son.</p>
<p>You can be sure this would never appear in a modern American text book.</p>
<p>You can also be sure these old texts are being burned at 451 degrees as they present an America that is White, safe, moral and hard working.</p>
<p>These old books have been well used, as shown by the stamps and signatures at the beginning of the books, but they are free of obscene or gang graffiti, torn or  folded pages, or sunflower seeds stuck in the interior binding.</p>
<p>That, of course, was in the golden days of education when kids were tracked according to their abilities  &mdash;  a system that never should have been abandoned and should be in place now. But that would be racist as White, Jewish and Asian kids filled the top ranks (as they do now) and all others would be at the bottom.</p>
<p>The most specious notion of the 20th century is the surreal Boasian, communist lie foisted on American Whites:  &#8216;Race is a Social Construct!&rsquo;,  which gave rise to the further lies that  &#8216;All Children Learn Equally&rsquo; and &#8216;IQ is meaningless.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Yes, God Bless the America of my Youth.</p>
<p>And to Jay:</p>
<p>Your fine essay should be printed in every major paper and Protestant church bulletin in the US.</p>
<p>But to speak of America as a better place before the 1965 immigration flood is heresy in the NWO.  And it will soon be Hate Speech punishable by real jail time.</p>

&#8220;Where will I go? I am a minority now in a country that is undergoing a demographic invasion. I do not believe my government when they say that whites are still 75% of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>My sincere, educated belief is that we are headed for mass chaos in this country that will gradually begin during this ongoing economic collapse, which is getting worse despite what the media and pols are trying to get us to believe.</p>
<p>We could either gravitate, mostly by race, to certain areas of the country and secede or we could have a violent upheaval that would end in the same kind of separation.</p>
<p>Even if this nation remains as a Brazil type society, with a sharp division between the haves and have nots, we still can escape this monstrous invasion by relocating to remote areas of the country, being self-sufficient and having a parallel society with our own schools, police forces, etc.</p>
<p>But, you&rsquo;re right on when you conclude that our existing communities are finished.  The American empire is breaking up and is on the way out.</p>
<p>This coming year will tell us much about whether we will have a peaceful or a violent breakup.  I seriously doubt that we will continue to exist as a second Brazil.</p>

		<p>it is time we adopt a destroy-or-be-destroyed strategy. a new white nationalist should be swept into power as president. he should arrest every living ex president, and any living person that served as the head of the immigration department in the last 50 years. he should also arrest any living liberal democrat or republicn politician. he should then put them on trial for the destruction of america, treason if you will, try them, convict them and sentence them to life in prison. he should then give them a reprieve by offering them to be in charge of our new established immigration department. give them the resources to run this department effectively, and their job will be to rid america of every single illegal on our shores. expect them to accomplish this mission within a 3 year period. if not, their sentence will be carried out. the carters,clintons bushs,etc are the people who held office and watched our country being invaded by third world illegals for 45 years. when they have completed this mission, they are then to be pardoned, but banned to a u.s. owned island for the rest of their lives, and never allowed to associate with the u.s. citizens that they tried to destroy. this would solve the problem.  </p>

		<p>Jay # 17,& Bon #25 &amp; Ice #29 This is a sad lament all over the White Anglo World. What you have said is all just so true, sad but true.And governments certainly know how to fudge demographic statistics.</p>
<p>We could look at a lot of the reasons for the demise of the society we once knew, most of these reasons have been well documented on this Amren web site.I have been very pleased to find and comment on this blog, most comments are quite well written and intelligent.When I first tried to find some web sites where I could share my concerns I initially found lots of &#8220;hate sites&#8221;. (Run by skin heads and nazis etc.)I do not find this problem with AmRen, you are doing a great job in raising public awareness of the perils facing the West bought on by terrible leadership at all levels.(Particularly education &amp; politics)</p>
<p>In Australia &amp; the UK we are concerned about the rise of Islam, but how many churches are really pro active about preserving Christianity, very few, hence the rise of Islam in the West. Many churches have sadly adopted PC which is a form of self destruction for Christian beliefs.</p>
<p>In the 70&rsquo;s it became unfashionable for educated white women to have babies, let alone stay at home looking after them. This is one more reason why it is the 3rd world immigrants in America Canada UK Australia who are the ones having the large families.</p>
<p>Those who wish to preserve our lifestyle should look no further than the recent demise of Rhodesia and South Africa for a simple lesson (and warning)in what happens when we become a minority in our own culture and society.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Provisions would include a path toward U.S. citizenship for the approximately 10.8 million people living in the country illegally, the White House said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about all of these calls for &ldquo;amnesties&rdquo; and &ldquo;paths toward citizenship,&rdquo; is that they always take on an air of mawkish hysteria in which the &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; of a genocide is to be paramount. How Mexicans fleeing Mexico from a &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; is plausible, is beyond me. Yes, they may be fleeing a: corrupt, overpopulated, and economically debased country, but that is largely of their own making. It is not as if some foreign power or even an internal cabal is planning their destruction as a goal; quite the contrary, both internal and external forces are using &ldquo;undocumented migrations&rdquo; as a safety valve for the continued expansion of Mexican fertility rates. </p>
<p>That is not a genocide!</p>
<p>Going to The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum website, I found an interesting definition of genocide and under what terms it should be a punishable crime. It is listed below: </p>
<p>&ldquo;An Evolving International Framework</p>
<p>Genocide is a term created during the Holocaust and declared an international crime in the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Convention defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:</p>
<p>a. Killing members of the group;<br>
b. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;<br>
c. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; <br>
d. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;<br>
e. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. </p>
<p>The specific &#8220;intent to destroy&#8221; particular groups is unique to genocide. A closely related category of international law, crimes against humanity, is defined as widespread or systematic attacks against civilians.&rdquo; </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/genocide" rel="nofollow">https://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/genocide</a></p>
<p>Ironically, points a. through e. are all criteria that are being inflicted on this country&rsquo;s white majority both internally and externally, when these &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; along the &ldquo;path to citizenship&rdquo; are even considered. Or for that matter, when a call for &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; is evoked when considering nonwhite minority issues in this country in general, or the eventual reduction of whites to a minority from their current majority status. Please consider:<br>
&ldquo;a. Killing members of the group,&rdquo; which is why both &ldquo;undocumented migrants&rdquo; and domestic nonwhite minorities seem to have a governmentally sanctioned new death-sport when interacting with whites;</p>
<p>&ldquo;b. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,&rdquo; the mainstream media&rsquo;s propaganda, public education, affirmative action,  socioeconomic mythology, and biased &ldquo;anti-hate&rdquo; legislation all do this to whites in the USA;</p>
<p>&ldquo; c. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,&rdquo; consider what I wrote in response to point b. and then just keep chanting &ldquo;multicultural diversity&rdquo; until consciousness is lost;</p>
<p>&ldquo;d. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,&rdquo; both the sanctification of miscegenation and the realities of forced integration&rsquo;s socioeconomic costs, are all that need be mentioned here;</p>
<p>&ldquo;e. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group,&rdquo; a bit more tricky is this point, but only when the word &ldquo;transferring&rdquo; is considered literally.  In most cases, white children are not yet being physically transferred to nonwhites for their amusement by governmental dictates.  However, psychologically, emotionally, culturally, and historically through aggrandized multiculturalism and the planned generational cleavages it engenders, they are transferred from their own people to the alien netherworld of kaleidoscopic &ldquo;utopia.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>
