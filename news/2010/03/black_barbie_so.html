			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alice Gomstyn, ABC News, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Walmart is raising eyebrows after cutting the price of a black Barbie doll to nearly half of that of the doll&rsquo;s white counterpart at one store and possibly others.</p>
<p>A photo first posted to the humor Web site FunnyJunk.com and later to the Latino Web site Guanabee.com shows packages of Mattel&rsquo;s Ballerina Barbie and Ballerina Theresa dolls hanging side by side at an unidentified store. The Theresa dolls, which feature brown skin and dark hair, are marked as being on sale at $3.00. The Barbies to the right of the Theresa dolls, meanwhile, retain their original price of $5.93. The dolls look identical aside from their color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Walmart spokeswoman, who could not verify the exact store shown in the photo, said that the price change on the Theresa doll was part of the chain&rsquo;s efforts to clear shelf space for its new spring inventory.</p>
<p>&#8220;To prepare for (s)pring inventory, a number of items are marked for clearance,&#8221; spokeswoman Melissa O&rsquo;Brien said in an e-mail. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&Nbsp;. Both are great dolls. The red price sticker indicates that this particular doll was on clearance when the photo was taken, and though both dolls were priced the same to start, one was marked down due to its lower sales to hopefully increase purchase from customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pricing like items differently is a part of inventory management in retailing,&#8221; O&rsquo;Brien said.</p>
<p>But critics say Walmart should have been more sensitive in its pricing choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The implication of the lowering of the price is that&rsquo;s devaluing the black doll,&#8221; said Thelma Dye, the executive director of the Northside Center for Child Development, a Harlem, N.Y. organization founded by pioneering psychologists and segregation researchers Kenneth B. Clark and Marnie Phipps Clark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other experts agree. Walmart could have decided &#8220;that it&rsquo;s really important that we as a company don&rsquo;t send a message that we value blackness less than whiteness,&#8221; said Lisa Wade, an assistant sociology professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles and the founder of the blog Sociological Images.</p>
<p>Last year, Wade posted a blog entry on another case where a black doll was apparently priced less than its white counterpart at an unidentified store. Wade said that when white dolls outsell black dolls, it&rsquo;s usually because black parents are more likely than white parents to buy their children dolls of a different race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most white parents wouldn&rsquo;t think to buy a black doll for their child, even if they believe in equality and all those things,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Overcoming &#8216;Decades of Racial and Economic Subordination&rsquo;</p>
<p>Decades after segregation and the civil rights movement, studies show Americans  &mdash;  both black and white  &mdash;  continue to internalize the heirarchical notion that lighter skin tone is considered &#8220;better than&#8221; darker, Wade said.</p>
<p>One landmark study revealing color hierarchies among black children took place in the 1940s. Run by the Clarks, Northside&rsquo;s founders, the study asked a group of black children to choose between playing with white dolls and black dolls; 63 percent chose the white dolls.</p>
<p>Last year, following the inauguration of the country&rsquo;s first black president, &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; revisited the experiment. This time, at least some of the results were markedly different: of the 19 black children surveyed, 42 percent said they&rsquo;d rather play with a black doll compared with 32 percent for the white doll. But when asked which doll was prettier, nearly half of the girls in the group chose the white doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black children develop perceptions about their race very early. They are not oblivious to this. There&rsquo;s still that residue. There&rsquo;s still the problem, the overcoming years, decades of racial and economic subordination,&#8221; Harvard University professor William Julius Wilson told &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wade [Lisa Wade, an assistant sociology professor at Occidental College] said that Walmart could have chosen to keep the dolls at equal prices in an effort not to &#8220;reproduce whatever ugly inequalities are out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sociological Images co-author Gwen Sharp, a sociology professor at Nevada State College, said that inequality might not necessarily be what&rsquo;s behind Ballerina Theresa&rsquo;s lagging sales.</p>
<p>Black parents, she said, may simply choose black dolls whose physical features hew more closely to those of themselves and their children. Barbie has weathered critcism in the past for producing dolls that bear little resemblance to the ethnicities they represent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Better Line of Black Barbies?</p>
<p>Last year, Barbie manufacturer Mattel debuted a new line of African American dolls, &#8220;So In Style,&#8221; designed to better resemble black women&rsquo;s facial features with wider cheeks, broader noses and fuller lips.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I fully respect retailers rights to mark things down as they see fit but I also think they need to look at the bigger picture,&#8221; Wachs [Lori Wachs, retail analyst] said. &#8220;I think there are certain things companies have to be sensitive about and clearly this was one of them.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Oh, please!  It had to do with MONEY - like most everything else - not race!  I believe the Af-Ams who keep squalling about race are what we in 12Step programs call &#8220;the original Copernican Revolution&#8221; - i.e. everything revolves around THEM.  Frankly, they aren&rsquo;t that important.  They are just another group in the myriad that make up this country.</p>

<p>Perhaps WalMart should charge a higher price thereby elevating the value of the black doll.</p>
<p><i>The dolls look identical aside from their color.</i></p>
<p>I wonder why, at a lower price, the black dolls aren&rsquo;t flying off the shelf? Why aren&rsquo;t black parents and black children snatching these up? After all, they&rsquo;re the same as the white dolls only less expensive. Blacks should be happy they get to pay less for black toys. </p>

<p><br>
How could any sane (non White)person find racism with a retaier who lowered prices for minorities? More proof that there is no pleasing SOME people. I would bet everything I own, that if the White doll had been marked down, instead of the black one, these same people would be complaining that Wal-Mart was overcharging for the black doll so minority children couldnt afford to buy one. Or some similar nonsense. </p>
<p>Everyone here at AmRen could have told Wal-Mart, Mattel, and anyone one else who cared to listen that these black dolls would not be a big seller. Wal-Mart no doubt already knew they wouldnt be, but probably ordered them along with the White dolls, to keep people like Thelma Dye from screaming racism. Fat lot of good that did.</p>
<p>If Wal-Mart had used some common sense, they would have claimed they lowered the price of the black doll&rsquo;s so minority children would be more able to afford to buy one. I dont see how Thelma, jesse or any other racial game player could complain or find any &#8220;institutional&#8221; racism with that. </p>

		<p>Multiculturalism and the political correctness that goes along with it produces all sorts of absurd situations that make most ordinary white Americans shake their heads and wonder what the hell this country is coming to.</p>
<p>And especially now that the groups pushing the multicultural agenda are the in-group in power we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of overreaching and a lot of excesses - we&rsquo;re in the  Multicultural Terror, as it were.</p>
<p>These absurdities, excesses and the overreaching should be pointed out whenever we can. Every one of these stories that alienates most right-thinking Americans is a chip out of the whole rotten edifice.</p>

		<p>I suppose the black dolls could have been moved to a different section of the store like the checkout area where the price difference wouldn&rsquo;t have been noticed or temporarily remove the White dolls off the shelves and leave one or two at the same price as the black ones.  But why should a retailer have to go through such nonsense?  This should be a lesson not to carry this kind of merchandise in the store if they&rsquo;re going to have to twist themselves into a knot to sell them and eventually end up taking a bath in them.  I suppose they could donate them to McDonalds and have them put into Happy Meals.  </p>

This could be read both ways. It could be seen as offering a special bargain to blacks that whites weren&rsquo;t getting, and whites would resent it. But if the white dolls were marked down, blacks would howl about discrimination.   You can&rsquo;t win!</p>
<p>In retailing, the market rules. If an item isn&rsquo;t selling, it&rsquo;s because people don&rsquo;t want it; and you can&rsquo;t force people to buy something they don&rsquo;t want.  All you can do is offer them an incentive.  It&rsquo;s been said here before, but to say it once again: blacks as customers are nothing but a pain.</p>

<p>Tell us, Professor Wilson, how can you explain that this perception is universal, in societies all around the world?</p>

		<p>Such a tempest in a teapot.  What if the black doll had been MORE expensive than the white one?  Then they&rsquo;d be screaming that blacks were being forced to spend more while whites get a price break; that black children are poorer to begin with, Walmart is trying to price blacks out of their store, yada yada yada.  I wish just once we could tell blacks to shut up, quit whining about stupid stuff like this and get over it.  But no.  We must be everlastingly &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to them!  I wonder if some of the more sensible, intelligent blacks are ever embarrassed by stories like this?</p>

<p>In my most darkest moments, I always reflect upon the hard fact of life that is black stupidity, with a melancholy joviality, of course. Evolution has missed them and true humanity has &ldquo;dissed&rdquo; them, so we are told. It is always for these reasons, all other considerations aside, that they never reach their &ldquo;potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How laughable!</p>
<p>Blacks are: avoided, segregated, and rejected, the entire world over for only one reason, they are not fully evolved. Somewhere, in the mix, we may be &ldquo;related to them&rdquo; as they love to hoot and squawk; however, they unfortunately only provide a link (perhaps not so &ldquo;missing&rdquo;) to a less intricate timeframe. Or put another way: it is always superciliously alluded to, that all peoples of the earth (but whites in particular) have somehow from a position of rhapsodized &ldquo;inferiority,&rdquo; destroyed both what blacks are supposed to have &ldquo;contributed&rdquo; to humanity in the past, while also destroying their &ldquo;potential&rdquo; for future &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not their &ldquo;skin&rdquo; that makes all of this a truth; it is their absurdly elevated arrogant ignorance, of which reality has not and never can provide justifications for!</p>
<p>Any who cannot see this, are far more fecklessly wretched than can be honestly fathomed!!!</p>
<p>As always, God Help Us All!</p>

		<p>I see nothing wrong with this. Actually WalMart has offered a &#8220;gift&#8221;. Historically, Black people make less money than White people, therefore, the Black Barbie should have cost less! </p>

		<p>The black Barbie should cost more in wal-mart because it comes with a &#8220;my baby daddy&#8221; baby doll. The buyer of this doll also has to supply the black Barbie with a home, food stamps, daycare, medical, cable, cell service and a whole gaggle of doll society programs&hellip;..What a bargain.</p>

		<p>As  usual, no quotes in the story from anyone who thinks the whole brouhaha is absurd.  There&rsquo;s a weak defense from a Walmart spokeswoman, but then the story immediately follows this up with a quote from &#8220;the executive director of the Northside Center for Child Development, a Harlem, N.Y. organization founded by pioneering psychologists and segregation researchers.&#8221; Then the story goes on to say that &#8220;Other experts agree,&#8221; with a reference to the bogus doll study from way back in the 1940s. But no quotation from someone like Jared Taylor who could point out that blacks in mostly black countries also showed a preference for white dolls. After all, we can&rsquo;t have anything in an MSM piece to ruin a good &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; story.</p>

		<p>heh, heh, HA, HA lol.  I swear these blacks are so insecure in their &#8220;blackness&#8221;.  Most Whites found a white Barbie that was half the price of other Barbies, they would buy 5 or 6 and not only give one to their kids but give them as presents.  But not the poor little blacks.  That mean old racist Wal-Mart&hellip;</p>

		<p>I notice no one mentions the very basic fact that Walmart buys its stuff in large lots.  In other words, they get a unit (a &#8220;lot&#8221;) of Barbie Dolls of various colors.  Probably the same number of black, white and latino versions of the doll.  However, the US as a whole (to say nothing of individual communities) is not 30/30/30 black, white, latino.  Assuming little girls want a doll that matches them, you are simply going to have leftover dolls.  If blacks are 15% of the population, but 30% of the dolls, that means you have twice as many dolls as you need in a lot.</p>
<p>Something the average consumer does not know.  It costs MONEY to keep something on the store shelf.  So much so that in, say, a grocery store, the store buys the food wholesale, but the individual brands have to rent shelf space.  Richer companies can buy more ideal product placement which results in higher sales for their item.  An odd situation where both the retailer and the wholesaler pay money to each other.</p>
<p>I have no idea if Walmart works that way, but there comes a time when it is no longer cost effective to keep something on the shelf.  It costs more to pay the lights, air conditioning and other overhead of the store than you would make in profit.  So you dump the item and take it at a loss&hellip;but first you discount it&hellip;then deep discount it.  Stores rarely throw stock in the trash (although a recent clothing retailer got into trouble for this rather than giving those items away to the poor).  Usually they sell it for pennies on the dollar to a liquidator, who then turns around and sells these &#8220;oddlots&#8221; on Ebay or in an actual store called Oddlots&hellip;.lol.</p>
<p>My point is, this has nothing to do with race.  It has nothing to do with if blacks want to buy their daughters black Barbies or white Barbies, or even no Barbie and spending the money on things they should not (like drugs).  It&rsquo;s just a side effect of the lot system.</p>
<p>Sure&hellip;.Walmart could demand its wholesaler give them a better lot ratio.  Why don&rsquo;t they?  The ONLY reason is it is more profitable somehow to do it the way they do now and just eat the loss.  I bring this up because the article assumes Walmart is carefully tracking supply and demand and pricing accordingly.  That is almost certainly not the case.  That costs money.  More money than simply eating the loss for untracked products nobody wants and eating it as a loss.</p>
<p>You see this everywhere.  For example, I wear the most common size pants for men in the US.  If I go to Walmart to buy jeans, they never have my size.  If I wear the most common size why is it so tough to find them on the shelf?  Because of the lot system.  Everyone else buys up my pants leaving none, while the less common sizes sit on the shelf waiting for someone to buy them before they re-order another lot of mixed pants sizes (or give up and sell those unwanted 22 waist, 40 inseem JJ Walker pants to Oddlots.</p>
<p>Walmart may or may not change due to the racial criticism.  Depends on if it would cost more than the lost business due to people being offended, I suspect.  The day that changes, its time to sell off your Walmart stock.</p>

Good heavens, with our Country bankrupt, the economy in shambles with no recovery in sight, the unemployment rate, home foreclosures, not to mention outageous wasteful spending by our government, they run a story about a black doll being marked down in their &#8220;money&#8221; section?

		<p>&#8221; But when asked which doll was prettier, nearly half of the girls in the group chose the white doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>so the majority, more than half, of &#8220;colored&#8221; childern polled think the darker is prettier. But that dosen&rsquo;t sound like &#8220;evil racisim&#8221;. So let&rsquo;s word it differently, instead of &#8220;the majority of the girls in the group chose the white doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly half. Neraly meaning close to but less than. Half, 50%. &#8221; Less than half of the girls in the group chose the white doll.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you buy the Mattel &#8220;Black Sh&rsquo;Nay Nay&#8221; doll be sure to read the label carefully. I didnt and got the &#8220;Sh&rsquo;NayNay WXA&#8221; Model(With Xtra Attitude) which renders it absolutely useless. Even though I bought every accessory for Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay nothing was good enough.<br>
And then came the arguments.. Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay not only talks..but will never shut up and there is no off switch. My daughter was in tears the first 5 minutes. After dressing her new doll in $65 worth of doll clothes and asking Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay if she wanted to play the reply was &#8220;I aint yo slave bitch&#8221; And then the real cursing began.<br>
I yanked the batteries out when Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay began throwing things and screaming &#8220;white honkey devils&#8221;. I returned the doll and for the normal version but then Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay wouldnt do anything. Just sit there watching TV for hours. Finally when I found a empty box of donuts under the sofa I said enough. But warning..there are no money back returns allowed with Black Sha&rsquo;Nay Nay.  The policy is that once purchased you have to support Sha Nay Nay for life. Tonight I came home and found a poorly written but legible note on my desk with the word &#8220;Reparations Now&#8221;on it. The doll is just glaring at me from the Sofa with the BET awards at maximum volume. And I wanted to listen to some Mozart this evening. This thing has turned into a nightmare. Be warned.<br>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s racism to treat people based on race, yet again, in the liberal mind it&rsquo;s okay creating dolls that make non whites comfortable.  Don&rsquo;t treat someone based on their race, yet do something to make a non-white person feel comfortable <i>simply</i> because of their race.</p>

		<p>I have no connection to Walmart or retailing but here&rsquo;s a simple idea. All graduates traditionally wear a black cap and gown. I notice that no africans or Whites apply any racial connotation to this but I suspect the tradition would not have continued if the garb was originally all white! Whites have never objected to the black stuff because it&rsquo;s a White tradition anyway and it would be silly, petty and childish to suggest it (please don&rsquo;t comment on the obvious) but it may be fun to start a spoof movement promoting all white graduation clothing just to hear the howls of protest! So, what I would do is dress all these black dolls in a cheap black gown and cap (or with a free accessory pack) and sell as &#8216;graduation dolls&rsquo; but at double the price of the White dolls. I bet that would shift &#8216;em, especially if the White dolls were not offered similarly dressed, well, not until all the black dolls had sold out!<br>

		<p>On a side note, there are so many variations among black people in terms of hair texture, skin tone, facial features, body types.  It&rsquo;s really quite diverse!  Will they have a dool to represent each type?  White barbies are easy: they just change the hair color and leave the rest unchanged.  They have unrealistic body types, but it is indicative of the general ideal.</p>

		<p>Outside of monopolies and distress situations the buyer determines the price.  This is particularly so for non-essentials such as a doll.  Walmart is a master at retailing.  All Walmart has done is reestablish a clearing price to move slow inventory.  Further, assuming the black and white Barbies cost Walmart the same wholesale price, then Walmart has taken less margin or possibly a loss by cutting prices on the black variety.  Obviusly not in Walmarts&rsquo; best interest.  Blacks are 12% of the economy and a higher percentage of Walmart&rsquo;s customer base.  Clearly even blacks were not enamored with the black Barbie.  Political whimsy and Ebonomics.</p>

		<p>General Quagmyer hit it right. I guess the next step will be for Black activist groups to DEMAND that White mothers buy their White daughters Black Barbie dolls&hellip; To instill the concept their children are supposed to like (love?) Blacks as much as if they were Whites.</p>
<p>When we were kids, I bought my younger sister a black doll&hellip; as a joke. The doll ended up in the trashcan, of course. But like I said, we had our laughs.</p>

		<p> Oh, the humanity, could it be that the white Barbie is in more demand than the black one  &mdash;  and hence the white Barbie is more expensive?</p>
<p>This reminds me of the old doll experiments of Kenneth Clark who claimed that black children in segregated schools preferred white dolls  &mdash;  hence proving these children had &#8220;internalized&#8221; racism. This evidence? was used in Brown vs. Board of Education to integrate segregated schools in the South. Isn&rsquo;t it possible that white Barbies are preferred by blacks from both segregated and integrated schools?<br>

		<p>All the whining, griping, and complaining about the most trivial things!  To gripe about such a thing proves that it will never end!</p>
<p>Time for action.  Lets start groups and associations that beat them at their own game.  </p>
<p>Example:  I no longer watch much ESPN but they are constantly taking light-hearted jabs at white athletes!  Does it bother me?  Heck no!  Because I&rsquo;m not a child and can take a light-hearted jab.  Here&rsquo;s what we need to do.  If a commentator cracks a quick little joke about a white basketball player dunking a ball (they DO do this) we need to act!  Call for the man&rsquo;s job for implying that whites can&rsquo;t play the game as good!  That&rsquo;s hate speech!</p>
<p>Sounds ridiculous.  That&rsquo;s the idea.  It is ridiculous.  We could totally do it though.  There are thousands of examples DAILY we could apply the whining and griping to. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A landmark study revealing color hierarchies among black children took place in the 1940s.  &hellip;. the study asked a group of black children to choose between playing with white dolls and black dolls; 63 percent chose the white dolls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, &hellip;.&rsquo;Good Morning America&rsquo; revisited the experiment. &hellip; of the 19 black children surveyed, 42 percent said they&rsquo;d rather play with a black doll compared with 32 percent for the white doll. But when asked which doll was prettier, nearly half of the girls in the group chose the white doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>..            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
I notice that the question was not which doll the children simply preferred (as being more similar to themselves), but which doll was &#8220;PRETTIER&#8221;.   Also, I don&rsquo;t know if this is merely an accident of wording, but I notice it says  that  the experiment was conducted on a &#8220;group of black CHILDREN&#8221;.  Out of those black children, &#8220;nearly half of the GIRLS in the group&#8221;  felt that the white dolls were prettier.  That is    &mdash;   put in other, more precise, words   &mdash;   less than half of the black GIRLS in the group felt that the white dolls were prettier.  [Quite natural!  Of course!]  I wonder, however, which doll the black BOYS in the group preferred. That is not mentioned!  </p>
<p>You needn&rsquo;t perform this experiment on children to see what blacks prefer.  One sees the same thing played out among black adults.  I recall a rather heated discussion that was going on among the (black) women in a place where I worked as to who was the best looking woman in the place.  They were mentioning Lateesha, Shaniqua, Laurentia,  Scotia, etc.   &mdash;  - all blacks.   I suggested that Helen was also a good looking woman (by far the best looking in the place!)&hellip;. but she was white.  I was curtly informed that, &#8220;We&rsquo;re only talking about black women!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Evidently, the title of  &#8220;best looking woman&#8221;  was not open to white women.  Helen was not popular with the black women, but the black men were hitting on her all the time &hellip; or trying.   No wonder the black women didn&rsquo;t care for her.</p>

<p>First of all, no black doll should ever be named &#8220;Theresa.&#8221;  Shamika, Loquita, or Natrine would be good choices.  Had she had black features and a black name she could have commanded the same price as Barbie and flew out the door.  The bottom line is blacks want a black doll that is black, preferably ghetto black, and whites won&rsquo;t touch a black doll &#8216;acting&rsquo; black or white!!!<br>

		<p>     HEY! My kid got a black Barbie(Theresa) from some neighbor who wanted to show the world how enlightened they are.  Two days later Black Barbie stole the GIJoe jeep, robbed the Fisher-Price Little People&rsquo;s bank, and drove off towards my liquor cabinet.  Fortunately, Johnny West tracked her down and she was arrested by Big Jim.  The trial was held before Major Matt Mason and she was convicted by a jury of Marx plastic Army men (&hellip; she claimed prejudice as the jury was stacked full of green faces..) but she was ultimately convicted and was sentenced to community service in the Weeble townhouse.  She was represented by Slinky.</p>

<p>Au contraire, liberal white parents are constantly buying their daughters black and brown dolls so that they&rsquo;ll (quite literally) embrace diversity.  On the other hand I&rsquo;m pretty sure that black parents aren&rsquo;t at all keen to buy white dolls for little Katrisha.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that if for some reason Walmart had priced the black Barbie at a higher price than the white Barbie there would have been howls of outrage that black parents have to pay more than white parents for their child&rsquo;s doll.  You just can&rsquo;t win with the diversity.<br>

		<p>Remember when you were a kid and watched some bully torturing his victim?   How he got his rocks off by his victim&rsquo;s humiliation,  and how the more trivial the victim&rsquo;s &#8220;offense&#8221;  the more he got off, because it demonstrated his complete dominance of the victim.    You don&rsquo;t pick fights with someone you fear/respect over trivial matters.   This story is a sort of ritual mounting where the white-hating Liberal establishment reminds whites and conservatives who&rsquo;s boss in this society.  They understand that it is ridiculous and trivial,  its value to them is its very triviality - there&rsquo;s no better (or more pleasurable) way to demonstrate your dominance than making your victim quake over nothing,  of having him understand that nothing he does will prevent you from torturing him.   You own him.    Whites whining about how silly this is are not accomplishing anything since the perpetrators of this little hate-spew fully understand how silly it is - that&rsquo;s the point.  </p>
<p>The proper response is something like this:  <i>Why is this sort of trivial non-story taking up space when this newspaper has never done a story about the 50 year long pandemic of black on white racist violence,  never mentioned the millions of black on white racist rapes that have taken place since the &rsquo;60s,  never mentions that fact that vast areas of our cities are no-go zones for whites.   It is obscene that this newspaper has plenty of time and space for a non-story about dolls but ignores large-scale racist violence against whites happening right under its nose.</i><br>
They&rsquo;ll censor such a reply at first,  but if enough people persist in such replies they won&rsquo;t be able to ignore them.   They won&rsquo;t start running stories on anti-white violence, of course, but it may make them stop running stories like this. </p>

<p>There used to be a management institute that advertised in magazines with a full-page ad stating: &#8220;In life you don&rsquo;t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.&#8221;</p>
<p>So True! That ad summed up the bitter truth of life: that life isn&rsquo;t fair. In real life, you can&rsquo;t count on getting what you deserve. You get only what you can negotiate.  And you negotiate from a position of strength. That is why plumbers earn more than typists: they have more powerful unions.  Whining and griping will get no one anywhere; in the real world it is clout that matters. And in politics, that means money and/or votes. </p>
