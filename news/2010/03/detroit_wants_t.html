<h1>Detroit Wants to Save Itself by Shrinking</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Runk, Google News, March 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Detroit, the very symbol of American industrial might for most of the 20th century, is drawing up a radical renewal plan that calls for turning large swaths of this now-blighted, rusted-out city back into the fields and farmland that existed before the automobile.</p>
<p>Operating on a scale never before attempted in this country, the city would demolish houses in some of the most desolate sections of Detroit and move residents into stronger neighborhoods. Roughly a quarter of the 139-square-mile city could go from urban to semi-rural.</p>
<p>Near downtown, fruit trees and vegetable farms would replace neighborhoods that are an eerie landscape of empty buildings and vacant lots. Suburban commuters heading into the city center might pass through what looks like the countryside to get there. Surviving neighborhoods in the birthplace of the auto industry would become pockets in expanses of green.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Things that were unthinkable are now becoming thinkable,&#8221; said James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, who is among the urban experts watching the experiment with interest. &#8220;There is now a realization that past glories are never going to be recaptured. Some people probably don&rsquo;t accept that, but that is the reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Politically explosive decisions must be made about which neighborhoods should be bulldozed and which improved. Hundreds of millions of federal dollars will be needed to buy land, raze buildings and relocate residents, since this financially desperate city does not have the means to do it on its own. It isn&rsquo;t known how many people in the mostly black, blue-collar city might be uprooted, but it could be thousands. Some won&rsquo;t go willingly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For much of the 20th century, Detroit was an industrial powerhouse  &mdash;  the city that put the nation on wheels. Factory workers lived in neighborhoods of simple single- and two-story homes and walked to work. But then the plants began to close one by one. The riots of 1967 accelerated an exodus of whites to the suburbs, and many middle-class blacks followed.</p>
<p>Now, a city of nearly 2 million in the 1950s has declined to less than half that number. On some blocks, only one or two occupied houses remain, surrounded by trash-strewn lots and vacant, burned-out homes. Scavengers have stripped anything of value from empty buildings. According to one recent estimate, Detroit has 33,500 empty houses and 91,000 vacant residential lots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is not known who might get the cleared land, but with prospects for recruiting industry slim, planners are considering agricultural uses. The city might offer larger tracts for sale or lease, or turn over smaller pieces to community organizations to use.</p>
<p>Maggie DeSantis, a board member of Community Development Advocates of Detroit, said she worries that shutting down neighborhoods without having new uses ready is a &#8220;recipe for disaster&#8221; that will invite crime and illegal dumping. The group recently proposed such things as the creation of suburban-style neighborhoods and nature parks.</p>

		<p>I think this is already happening even though nobody is really &#8220;planning&#8221; it.  CofCC.org sometimes has articles and photos about whole swaths of Detroit reverting to a country area, and even some older high rise buildings that have been abandoned are becoming common nesting sites for bird species, like peregrine falcons, that are rarely seen in urban areas.  It seems like blacks turn their urban neighborhoods into rural ones within a matter of a few generations.</p>

		<p>Funny, I just wrote today to a former Detroit resident that there surely isn&rsquo;t anything inherently wrong with the LAND in Detroit - it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s in the hands of blacks, who seem to not have what it takes to take a lousy area and turn it into a showplace.  Trust me, if Detroit was in the hands of Asians, Jews, or whites of any background, it&rsquo;d be a masterpiece within a year.  Blacks can and do destroy perfectly good areas, but they are not able to build up bad areas.  Wait and see - some very smart group of individuals is going to BUY Detroit and turn it into a place people will be begging to get into!!</p>

		<p>Detroit is the poster child of what liberalism is doing to the United States. This is what happens when blacks run everything. Whitey (even liberal whitey) will run away when blacks want whitey to continue to support them when the main source of income for the area has dried up and gone away. And this is because of liberals running the city and driving business away to begin with. It is a vicious cycle.</p>

		<p>this is madness, deliberate destruction of national wealth &#8220;because they can&#8221;, because they are dumb, arrogant bastards. If they want to remove people from these areas and turn them desolate, alright, fine, they can expel the people and surround it with barbed wire as a no-go zone. If they are too stupid to know how to use the abandoned houses now, maybe smarter people in the future will figure it out. But no - the wreckers cannot stop, they need to wreck and destroy whatever they touch.</p>

2) White build up the farms, find success growing vegetables or raising poultry.<br/>
3) neat little farm houses and barns spring up.<br/>

		<p>I wonder what will be grown on Detroit farm.  I really hope someone plants cotton and watermelon(OK, I know it&rsquo;s too cold).  Will that cause a riot, or will blacks not really care because the illegals will be doing all the work.  They&rsquo;ll probably just sue the USDA to get some &#8220;farm money&#8221; owed to them because of &#8220;racism&#8221;.<br/>

		<p>Well, we all know where this is going: that &#8220;farmland&#8221; will then serve as the basis for several thousand more &#8220;black farmer racism victims&#8221;.  Some of those uprooted families will be given the new farmland.  Then they will cut their feet on broken beer bottles or poke themselves with old hypodermic needles that lay buried in the ground.  Then they&rsquo;ll claim it was &#8220;racism&#8221; that led to the decline of Detroit and, therefore to the conversion of those lands to farming.  Hence, if not for &#8220;racism&#8221;, they would not have hurt their feet on the buried rubbish.</p>

		<p>It may have been an area fit for agriculture before homes and buildings went up in these neighborhoods. But the act of building often requires alteration of drainage patterns and modification of the soil, which may no longer be fit for agriculture as a result.  Somebody needs to look before they leap.</p>

		<p>If not farmland, then forest and field or whatever passes for wilderness in what was once Detroit, is that which inexorably must come to pass.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in what still passes for civilization, concentrating Detroit&rsquo;s destructive residents into fewer areas should help accelerate the ruin of the rest of the city.</p>

<p>It can be done.  The ground must be cleaned up, of course.  Buildings must be removed, including the foundations.  At first the land could be made into pastures for small, grazing livestock.  An aggressive program of land restoration would be required for &#8220;industrial level&#8221; farming, but it could be done, not cheaply if you want to farm straight away, but it can be done.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to let nature takes it&rsquo;s course.  Nature can reclaim the land a lot quicker than you may realize.  Just look at the Chernobyl atomic plant near the town of Pripyat in the Ukraine.  It has become quite lush despite the nuclear contamination.  Detroit isn&rsquo;t nearly as poisonous.<br/>

		<p>This proposal has been made before.</p>
<p>The land has been vacant in large tracts for some time, but was found in many cases to be unsuitable for farming. Too much industrial grade pollution, etc.</p>
<p>I do recall reading that for over a period of over twenty years, Detroit has been observed by one of these satellites in orbit, picture taking, composites made of the land that is reverting back to nature. The greening of Dee-troit they call it.</p>
<p>About 50 % of what was once inhabited space has gone back to &#8220;green&#8221;, and with rapidity too. Who even got the idea in the first place to do this study, this project, and why they got the idea is not known.</p>
<p>I have a fried whose wife was from Detroit, grew up there. She and her family once a year used to make a trek to the old manse to see what was left of the neighborhood. She said that you could stand on a street corner and for a HALF MILE see only vacant lots in one direction, where on each lot there used to be a home. </p>
<p>As late as 1950 or so Dee used to be probably among the dozen or so most important cities IN THE WORLD. Because of the influence of the auto industry. What Dee did, the rest of the world emulated. That would be a bad idea now.</p>

		<p>Istvan posted precisely my same thoughts, albeit even better than I would&hellip;.</p>
<p>The best thing that can be done is leave it flat, open and barren. My experiences with the africans in forested areas close to their homes is that they now have even more places to conduct their negative behavior unseen. I have seen pimps and whores come out of the woods in suburban chicago, all within walking distance of their &#8216;mommas house&rsquo;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>move residents into stronger neighborhoods</p>
<p><br/>
And here you have the real focus of what they want to do.  Nobody cares if parts of Detroit are demolished.  What they really want is an excuse to move black criminals into white neighborhoods.  Which is, of course, what caused what happened to Detroit.</p>
<p>Ron Paul, by the way, has the perfect solution to this issue.  Although he never mentions race anymore (note that he used to talk about race but avoids the issue like the plague these days) the crux of what he wants to do is immediately and drastically cut military spending and slowly but surely cut welfare until it is no more.</p>
<p>Without welfare, blacks can&rsquo;t survive in white neighborhoods unless they are living the white lifestyle.  Only the black with a decent job could then live in the city with the rest of the working folk.  All other blacks (the overwhelming majority) can only afford to live in areas where supply and demand have reduced the cost of living (ie Detroit with its $100 houses).</p>
<p>This is a very, VERY important thing to understand.  The only reason the &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221; (which had nothing to do with anything except anti-white racism) had the power to do ANYTHING is because it intersected with welfare.  The exact degree to which America is socialist is the degree to which whites are disempowered and displaced by non-whites.</p>
<p>Dismantle socialism and solve the problem, permanently and probably with shocking ease.</p>
<p>Vote Ron Paul.</p>

		<p>A fine plan! There is no logical to allow huge swaths of our nation to lie in blight and rubble to serve only as battlefields for warring gangs in the forlorn hope that foolish business owners are going to flock back to a city known only for crime, corruption and crumbling infrastructure&hellip;.</p>
<p>BUT somehow I just have a hunch thirty or forty years from now the federal government  &mdash;  probably under the stalwart leadership of our third or fourth black  president  &mdash;  will be paying out hundreds of billions in &#8220;damages&#8221; to the black citizens of former Detroit as compensation for plowing under their &#8220;vibrant&#8221; and &#8220;diverse&#8221; urban paradises.</p>
<p>If you thought the USDA farm loan &#8220;discrimination&#8221; case was bad, just imagine how much future generations are going to pay for demolishing motown! </p>

		<p>Would the city need to call out volunteers to reinstate &#8220;Devil&rsquo;s Night&#8221; to get some of the more recalcitrant citizens to relocate to a more concentrated area? Even though they are in a smaller version of Zimbabwe, open space has its advantages. If the federal government doles out money for this project, could congress place a stipulation in the bill that Detroit has to shrink the city borders by 35 - 45 %. Take that land and sell it to productive asians/whites under a non black controlled town and watch it flourish. This will probably not be allowed to happen, but it is a nice idea.</p>
<p><br/>
On Youtube, there are a series of 6 videos made about Detroit in 1965, here is the first in the series. It is truly sad to think how far that city has fallen. </p>

		<p>Remember the &#8220;sprawl&#8221; complaints a few years back? Liberals are all about forcing Americans into small areas (cities) where there are fewer homeowners (who are usually Republican) and people can be more easily controlled, disarmed, and subjugated by the police/National Guard/UN Troops.</p>
<p>The leftist would love to plow under every suburban enclave so there is no more &#8220;fly-over country&#8221;, just urban closeness with all the city rabble cheek-by-jowl and all of the attendant crime and misery.</p>

		<p>2010.02.18: Black Farmers Win $1.25 Billion in Discrimination Suit<br/>
This can be found from AMREN archives&hellip; Now surely here is an ideal solution. Just meld these topics and stir in a little imagination. No need to pay out fake compensation, just offer land instead. Of course it needs fixing but it would be free to the farmers. Some time ago I suggested that these areas be bulldozed and turned over for Buffalo grazing. If things were left &#8216;as is&rsquo;, nature would gradually take over anyway.

		<p>Looks like a perfect opportunity to give them all their forty acres and a mule.  Think we&rsquo;d see any takers?</p>

		<p>As others here have alluded, this sounds like southern Africa.  The city better sell the land cheap, so that the buyers can afford plenty of razor wire and other protections!  <br/>
Isn&rsquo;t it a laugh that DeSantis of the community development org. proposed suburbs and parks?!  And what would the ghetto dwellers do to them?<br/>
For decades, American cities have been tearing down neighborhoods and erecting projects in which to herd low-class blacks.  Detroit is now run by blacks, who probably see this latest scheme as a way to get federal and corporate money off which they can graft.  </p>

		<p>With one quarter of 139 sq miles on offer and at 640 acres per sq mile, this is exactly 552 lots of 40 acres which could be made available, albeit without the free mule. These should be awarded to individual black Detroit residential applicants who apply with cash-up-front bids. Each applicant to be vetted to ensure they have sufficient agricultural, administrative and financial means to avoid another &#8216;Pigford&rsquo; fiasco. Lot numbers to be drawn randomly from a &#8216;hat&rsquo; and awarded in turn to the highest 552 bids. Funds to be used as compensation to be paid to current plot owners. Resale of lots would be prohibited for the initial 10 years. All produce to be delivered to, and bought by, the Detroit welfare board at guaranteed fair market prices and distributed to welfare claimants instead of food stamps. Each lot to be frequently inspected with any unproductive lot being forfeited back into the draw with no compensation being paid. Mules may be impractical but usage shares in communal tractor and accessories with experienced drivers and maintenance facilities must be made available for hire.</p>

		<p>To save Detroit, you don&rsquo;t turn it into farmland (polluted soil, etc.). You save it by bringing JOBS into the geographic area. The problem there, understandably, being Detroit&rsquo;s large Black population. Its constant mis-government and governmental bungling and mismanagement, thanks to those same people.</p>
<p>What company with any brains at all in top management&hellip; would want to bring a business into a city where crime is an ever-present constant. Where you&rsquo;d need armed guards and costly security devices to protect your establishment as soon as night falls.</p>

		<p>Good luck with the &#8216;farms&rsquo;.  In New Orleans (basically Detroit, only hotter), nobody cannot grow ANYTHING, because the locals will steal the produce the second it is ready for consumption.  I&rsquo;ve heard about people whose Avocados were stolen, people whose Kumquats were stolen, people whose pots of Lemongrass were lifted&hellip;people whose PANSIES were ripped out of the ground before their owners were able to come back with the watering can&hellip;.</p>
<p>Are they going to put up giant fences, to protect the &#8216;farms&rsquo;?</p>
<p>And are they seriously considering growing produce on ground saturated with lead from auto emissions and paints, and soaked with Chlordane (&#8220;&hellip;exposure to Chlordane comes mostly from eating contaminated foods, such as root crops&hellip;&#8221;) and Pentachlor for Termites?  Tree farms would make more sense.  Although, really, with a population like Detroit&rsquo;s, NOTHING really makes sense.  EVERYTHING will be a disaster, because that&rsquo;s what these people spread: DISASTER.</p>

		<p>[American] <i>strengths had been fading for some time, mainly due to poorly controlled mass immigration and to the march of political correctness. They had also been weakened by the failure of America&rsquo;s conservative party – the Republicans – to fight on the cultural and moral fronts. </i></p>
<p><i>They preferred to posture on the world stage. Scared of confronting Left-wing teachers and sexual revolutionaries at home, they could order soldiers to be brave on their behalf in far-off deserts.</i> - Peter Hitchens</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s odd how nobody takes the blame for what happened to Detroit.   Just complete silence from the media and politicians.   If you can even talk about your problems you sure aren&rsquo;t going to solve them.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we had just one Congressman who would stand up on the floor of the House and say he wasn&rsquo;t going to even consider voting for one penny of tax money that rewards Detroit for the racist ethnic cleansing that got them into this mess until the Mayor issues a public acknowledgment and apology.</p>
<p>Will this new farmland be under the political control of the government of Detroit?   If so you&rsquo;d be a fool to do anything more than a short-term lease. </p>
<p>This could be a blessing to the suburbs of Detroit, putting more distance between them and the city. </p>

		<p>Won&rsquo;t work.  I read some time ago that Detroit residents who have attempted to plant their own gardens found the neighbors stole the produce before or immediately upon it becoming ripe. Farm produce will just be something  else of value to steal.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But then the plants began to close one by one&#8221;,,,,,</p>
<p>Yes, BUT WHY - WHY - did those plants &#8220;begin to close&#8221;? This is the unspoken question that goes unanswered. Did one day somebody just decide out of the blue to close those plants? Just because they felt like it? Such linguistic mumbo-jumbo,,,, in reality the plants closed because the demographic racial changes that engulfed Detroit made it unsafe and uneconomical to be there. Had Detroit remained an overwhelmingly White city those plants would still be there. </p>
