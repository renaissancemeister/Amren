			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Allen, The Hill, March 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) secured a critical bloc of healthcare votes on Thursday when the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) announced its support.</p>
<p>Half a dozen members of the CHC held a news conference to announce their support. They were unhappy with language that barred illegal immigrants from accessing the public health insurance exchanges. More than a dozen had threatened to vote against the Senate bill and its companion reconciliation package. The House healthcare bill, which passed by two votes, won the support of every member of the Hispanic Caucus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the lawmakers determined the fight for the immigration language was not worth killing the broader package. And at least one said his vote came after President Barack Obama this week assured him that he would push for a broad immigration overhaul.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic Democrats said they decided to strengthen their own cause and the president&rsquo;s hand by helping him attain a major victory. They also said they have set the stage for addressing the public-exchange issue after the healthcare bill becomes law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been a legislator for 35 years,&#8221; said Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.). &#8220;Once you have a law on the books, you can amend it as time goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Council of La Raza is standing firm against the bill because of the immigration language.</p>
<p>&#8220;The argument that everyone should support healthcare reform because it&rsquo;s for the &#8216;greater good&rsquo; has given national leaders an excuse to brush off the concerns of the most disenfranchised and vulnerable communities that desperately need results,&#8221; Jennifer Ng&rsquo;andu, deputy director of La Raza&rsquo;s Health Policy Project, wrote in an op-ed on the Huffington Post Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;More often than not, appeals to the &#8220;greater good&#8221; come at the expense of the most vulnerable communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of the language, hispanics are going to get tax payer funded health care. Not only that, they&rsquo;ll move to the head of the line because they&rsquo;ll be labeled &#8216;poor, at-risk, and under-served&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic Caucus assured that a vote for health bill improves chances for amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t necessary to promise them amnesty for their tribal members, because they&rsquo;ve always been behind this healthcare debacle from the beginning.</p>
<p>Have you known of any of them who aren&rsquo;t in favor of a government program? </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t overlook the unintended consequence the community organizer can&rsquo;t see, because, as a black, he is limited in his ability to logic coherently, which is the fact that he is uniting the right as never before.  For the first time a mainstream newspaper is advocating impeachment (the Washington Times).  Though it&rsquo;s a right leaning paper, I&rsquo;ve never known of one&hellip;.left or right&hellip;. EVER being so harsh on a sitting president.  They&rsquo;re calling Obama and his cronies Chicago thugs.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m honestly expecting that this upsurge in anger and blatant outrage from the right might well call for action next, especially if the Obamanation&rsquo;s amnesty program goes through.</p>
<p>This community organizer is as blatant and foolish as I expected him to be.  I&rsquo;ve often said that when he&rsquo;s pressured, we will see the ghetto black uppermost in his personality.</p>
<p>I believe we&rsquo;re seeing it now, right along with his irrepressible black arrogance.</p>

		<p>I think we can all agree that the Mestizo flood into America is bad for Whites but more so for Blacks. If the Mestizos ever gained control of America they would end up pushing Blacks off the cliff shortly after they push us off.. My true hope is that this is a strategic move on his part and in the end he turns on them. It would almost make it worth it. After all it&rsquo;s really American Whites and Blacks that have an intertwined history that built our great nation.(sort of like a dysfunctional family that still has history as a common denominator)<br>
It is the Mestizos that are the true interlopers. With his Afrocentric background I can&rsquo;t help but believe that he realizes the threat they pose to both White and Black. Let us pray!</p>

		<p>Why is the HC saying that illegals won&rsquo;t get ObamaCare simply b/c there&rsquo;s some useless sentence that states that illegals can&rsquo;t get?  (1) Amnesty is next on the legislative agenda.  Everyone will be legal anyway.  (2) Even if there is no amnesty, the HCR bill has no real enforcement mechanism.  (3) Even if there was an enforcement mechanism, many illegal aliens procure fake IDs.  (4) Even if they couldn&rsquo;t, there is the matter of common sense   &mdash;   Federal bureaucrats would administer ObamaCare, and they would be heavily Hispanic in Hispanic-heavy states, and would be loath to tell a family of illegals no when they go to the Federal building in Los Angeles to sign up for ObamaCare.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&hellip;More often than not, appeals to the &#8216;greater good&rsquo; come at the expense of the most vulnerable communities&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s quite correct.  &#8216;Vulnerable communities&rsquo; = NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>
<p>Those who are being displaced, forced to cede their livelihoods and homelands to hostile &#8216;others&rsquo;, shut up about it under penalty of prosecution, and pay for monstrous government programs (will it be pogroms?) via punitive taxes.</p>
<p>National health care?  Illegal colonist amnesty?  In the midst high unemployment and a falling dollar?  With the Chinese becoming more skittish about writing blank checks to the US?</p>
<p>I am convinced now more than ever that the main goal of this administration is to collapse the American economy, giving the hostile elites an opportunity, once for all,  to completely take over the government.  The first orders of business will be to heavily regulate the Internet and re-implement the Fairness Doctrine. </p>
<p>Yes, Big Government Knows Best!</p>
<p>After all, it worked out so well in the old Soviet Union  &mdash;  the old bosses always did claim they were working for the &#8216;greater good&rsquo; and Walter Duranty of the NYT was happy to report to the American people about the wonderful advantages of an authoritarian government:</p>
<p>&#8221;..Duranty wrote that &#8216;village markets [were] flowing with eggs, fruit, poultry, vegetables, milk and butter&hellip; . A child can see this is not famine but abundance.&rsquo; &#8216;There is no famine or actual starvation, nor is there likely to be.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yf4qnpd</p>
<p>Duranty penned this in 1933, knowing it was false, concealing his knowledge of the great famine and Stalin&rsquo;s mass murders (the Soviets apparently threatened to expose Duranty&rsquo;s homosexuality).</p>
<p>And for this reporting, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>The NYTs has many Duranty-types reporting now, claiming Government Knows Best, that the health care plan will &#8216;save money&rsquo;, and that illegal amnesty is &#8216;good for the economy.&rsquo;  Many claim it is the media that elected the obama administration and I have seen no reason to doubt this.</p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s torch should be extinguished  &mdash;  no better yet, pull it down and let it lie in ruins like the old statue of Ozymandias.</p>

		<p>Some of this has to do with race but not all, most of it is about power politics.</p>
<p>The Hispanic Caucus, like all Politicians care more about thier personal power than their constituents.  They know that all the new Hispanic voter needs to see is Gomez or Ramirez as a last name on the ballot and they will vote for them.  As a lifetime resident of South Florida I have seen hardcore Hispanic Republicans be blinded and vote for the nice local Hispanic politician who happened to be a Democrat.</p>
<p>Obama, a new voter block that is inclined to vote for Socialist strongmen who promise government cures.  As proof see, the current governments in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua and Bolivia all are either pure socialists or European socials who have come to power through elections.  Lets see if the new group will be able to vote in 2012.</p>
<p>Democrat Party, again a population that is inclined to vote for big government.</p>
<p>Republican Party, In freaking fantasy land if they think they can pull any sizable block of voters from this group.  See Graham, McCain and unfortunately W.</p>
<p>Tie this in to the new push in congress to repeal State laws that take away convicted felons their voting rights and you get more Democrat voters, which they will need in the next couple of election cycles until the &#8220;free health care&#8221; for the poor kicks in.  </p>
<p>Obama and the Democrats need to change the political landscape, since the have angered so many voters.  <br>

<p>The White elites in America are not all that hard to understand. Their motivation is this:maximize their wealth as quickly as possible. They do not think about the consequences of their actions for the larger native born white community. </p>
<p>What I have just described is the definition of psychopath. A documentary came out a few years with the title:The Corporation as a psychopath. Perfect description of Dick Armey.</p>

		<p>Have any illegals ever been questioned on the fairness of what their vast numbers are doing to this country? I&rsquo;d like to ask them the following:<br>
1. What happens to illegal aliens who sneak into Mexico? Do you feel they should be allowed to stay and receive the benefits of citizens?<br>
2. Do you think if a foreigner sneaked into Mexico and had a child, he or she should immediately receive Mexican citizenship and eventually be able to bring family members in?<br>
3. Do you think you are entitled to receive amnesty before the people who&rsquo;ve waited and obeyed the rules to come to our country?<br>
These questions are only a beginning but hopefully it will give them something to think about. Will it change their minds? No.</p>

		<p>The heading should read ALL DEMS to vote yes on all socialist agendas. Of all ethnicities to vote yes on this massive gov&rsquo;t takeover minorities and illegals, have the least reason. While they don&rsquo;t have health insurance, they already have free health care, since not one can be refused treatment in this highly enlightened communist society. They along with every other AmeriKan &#8220;subject&#8221; will loose big time. The change you were promised is happening just as we were told. This is just our luck, that the absolute worst commander [of cheef] in the last 150 years, is actually going try to keep his promise for change for all 57 states, much to the delight of his two closest mentors and comrades, the Rev Wright, and Bill the bomber Ayres. </p>

		<p>This is going to amount to racial plunder.  The productive, tax paying whites are going to have their health care cut to give to tax consuming blacks and mestizos.  Atlas will shrug at some point.</p>

		<p>Barack Obama is not the worst commander and chief in the last 150 years. Going as far back as John F. Kennedy, they are equally bad. There is complete continuity if fundamental policy:1)race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS throug LEGAL IMMIGRATION and illegal immigration of nonwhites;2)outsourcing of manufacturing jobes;3)invade the world.</p>

		<p>Under the new bill, what would happen if I buy the most expensive health insurance policy, make the mandated payment for one month and then default on subsequent ones?  Would I be criminally liable?  Just the idle thought of an idle mind  &mdash;  would we not have toxic mortgages and &#8220;toxic&#8221; hospitals? </p>
