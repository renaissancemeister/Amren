<h1><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/182392.php">Study Finds Blacks Have Highest Cancer Rates of All Racial Ethnicities, Yet Feel Less at Risk</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medical News Today, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, a new study by University at Buffalo researchers shows that persons of different ethnic groups have different ideas and opinions about whether they are at risk for developing cancer  &mdash;  perceptions that can influence whether they undergo screening.</p>
<p>The study results reveal that blacks feel less at risk of getting cancer than do whites  &mdash;  the comparison group in the study  &mdash;  although they have the highest cancer incidence and mortality of all racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Hispanics and Asians also believed they were at a lower risk than whites, results show, and the differences remained in all groups even when variables such as age and education are considered.</p>
<p>The study appears in the March issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Respondents were asked how likely they thought it was that they would develop cancer in the future, (to determine their perceived risk) and answered questions on their family&rsquo;s history of cancer, their history of cigarette smoking, how they rated their current health and their beliefs about the disease.</p>
<p>Results showed that blacks were less likely to report cancer in the family, which was associated with thinking they had a lower risk of developing the disease than did whites. Similar patterns emerged for Hispanics and Asians, results showed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perceived risk also was lower among Hispanics and Asians because fewer members had a history of smoking, results showed. &#8220;Some cancers are strongly associated with smoking and others are not,&#8221; Orom [Heather Orom, PhD, assistant professor in the UB Department of Health Behavior, School of Public Health and Health Professions] says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s possible that if nonsmokers think they are at low risk of developing all cancers, it could keep them from getting cancer screening and embracing habits associated with lowering risk, such as eating more fruits and vegetables and being more physically active.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Vitamin D deficiency is directly related to incidence of cancer (as well as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and a plethora of other chronic and eventually fatal ailments). </p>
<p>A vast number of blacks live outside the latitude that their skin is evolved to thrive in. </p>
<p>With insufficient UV exposure relative to black melanin levels, coupled with abysmally low average IQs and egos constantly pumped up with the usual PC nonsense, and you have an obviously sickly and disease prone ethnic group with delusions of health and beauty. </p>
<p>Mystery solved. </p>

		<p>This is supposed to be news?  That blacks have a higher incidence of cancer, but feel they are LESS risk prone than everybody else?  They feel the same way about AIDS.<br>
Huge disproportionate number of them have it, but would even ONE of them think to use a condom unless it was to reduce the chance of DNA ratting them out when they commit rape?</p>

<p>Right. When AIDS first began to manifest itself, the blacks used to chuckle with amusement that this was a disease of the white gay boy in San Francisco! NOW that the black gets AIDS at a rate much greater than the general white population this must be just like: &#8220;The Tuskegee &#8216;Experiment&rsquo; Study&#8221;!</p>
<p>Always the wrong ideas, thoughts, attitudes, perceptions of EVERYTHING!</p>

		<p>The next time you&rsquo;re buying groceries, pay attention to what a Black EBT card user is buying in her (usually a female) FULL cart of groceries. If you believe that diet (and cigarettes) are  major factors in cancer, some things will begin to fall into place.  </p>

		<p>The title of the article says it all, &#8220;Study Finds Blacks Have Highest Cancer Rates Of All Racial Ethnicities, Yet Feel Less At Risk&#8221;, since feeling less at risk usually translates into a lack of awareness about their condition. No doubt that Blacks having a lower intelligence and reasoning ability also contributes to a lack of awareness.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a doctor&rsquo;s office I was in with paper-thin walls. A doctor was in the next room desperately trying to explain to an overweight black woman why she needed a &#8216;dye test&rsquo;. He had tried in vain to explain to her what a myelegram was, so he reduced it to &#8216;dye test&rsquo;. You could hear her shriek throughout the office, &#8220;Oh NO! NO SUH! NOOOOO SUH!  Dye&rsquo;ll make you DIE!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Nuff said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Results showed that blacks were less likely to report cancer in the family&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The words &#8220;family&#8221; and &#8220;Blacks&#8221; are quite odd in the same sentence. The illegitimacy rate for Blacks is greater than 70 percent (Vdare.com, 2006). </p>
<p>My point is that Blacks are &#8220;less likely to report cancer in the family&#8221; because the vast majority of Blacks do not know who their &#8220;families are, or perhaps they have murdered some or all of them. </p>
<p>Of the few that do know who their fathers, mothers, sisters, and/or brothers are, there is a high probability that they are incarcerated, on the run from the law, or in the process of committing a felony. </p>
<p>This is all transpiring while White families are complaining to everyone in their immediate and extended families their health issues. </p>
<p>Remember, too, that communication is a concept that is relatively new for Blacks. To this day, Black Africa does not have a written language and many cultures there communicate by clicks, clacks, grunts, and groans. I doubt that &#8220;click, click, clack&#8221; can effectively communicate a complex idea such as, &#8220;Mom, I have cervical cancer and AIDS. I will likely be dead in a week.&#8221;</p>
