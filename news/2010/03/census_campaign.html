<h1>Census Campaign Targets Tech-Savvy Hispanic Youth</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jacob Adelman, Google News, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Groups pushing for robust Hispanic participation in the 2010 census announced a new campaign Thursday that aims to reach the hard-to-count demographic through its smart-phone-toting youngsters.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Be Counted, Represent&#8221; campaign offers music downloads and a chance at concert tickets to cell phone users who share their e-mail addresses and phone numbers with organizers and forward information about the census to their friends.</p>
<p>Principal organizers Voto Latino and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund stress in their messages that undercounted areas risk losing funding for transit, infrastructure and other needs, as well as political representation.</p>
<p>They hope those messages promoting participation in the count will zip throughout the social networks of youngsters who can persuade their parents to fill out and return their census forms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign offers a package of 25 music downloads curated for a young Hispanic audience to cell phone users who share their zip codes, e-mail addresses and cell phone numbers with the program&rsquo;s organizers. The downloads include songs by such artists as Pitbull, Mos Def and Morrissey.</p>
<p>Users can get also get songs by taking census quizzes on a smart phone application that they download.</p>
<p>If they invite their friends to download the application, they&rsquo;re entered into a raffle for tickets to a &#8220;secret concert&#8221; to be held in the Los Angeles area in April.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Organizers said such measures are a way to get through to an ethnic group that has been hard for census officials to reach because of indifference, language barriers and  &mdash;  for some  &mdash;  deportation fears.</p>

<p>What, no Hispanic music?  Talk about going over like a lead balloon   &mdash;   black rap to young Hispanics to fill out a census form.</p>
<p><i>Organizers said such measures are a way to get through to an ethnic group that has been hard for census officials to reach because of indifference, language barriers and &mdash; for some &mdash; deportation fears.</i></p>
<p>Deportation?  That means they&rsquo;re illegals, and shouldn&rsquo;t be counted.  Remember, the whole purpose of a census is to count the number of people in each state for Congressional apportionment.  </p>

<p>Now wait a minute. There should be a category for illegals, so we would KNOW how many there are, rather than guessing, especially before granting God-knows-how-many amnesty.</p>
<p>I, like most here, don&rsquo;t believe the MSM lies about 10-11 million illegals in the US. &#8220;They&#8221; were saying 12 million for how long now? Meanwhile thousands of new ones arrive every day. I think 20-30 million is more accurate, and that doesn&rsquo;t even count the millions of anchor babies, who are, unfortunately, granted citizenship automatically.</p>

		<p>The reason why rap music is used instead of Hispanic music is because there has been no other Hispanic artist since the death of Selena nearly 15 yrs ago that can generate interest among all Hispanics. Most of today&rsquo;s hispanic entertainers do well within their own ethnic group. For example, Jenni Rivera and Los Tigres del Norte appeal to Mexicans. Gloria Estefan appeals to Cuban Americans and Marc Anthony&rsquo;s music appeals to Puerto Ricans. Selena was the only artist whose music appealed to all Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Most of the Mexicans I know despise black rap music - they won&rsquo;t listen to it.  They like the simplistic Mexican mariachi music - with a tuba for a bass, guitars for rhythm, and trumpets for melody.  Chords are generally I, IV, V, I - or I, IV, ii, V, I.  Real adventuresome stuff.  Coupled with a hefty 3/4 or 4/4 beat.  It would have led Mozart to drink at age six!</p>

Orwellian Newspeak euphemism for illegal aliens: Indigenous Immigrants </p>
<p>&ldquo;Indigenous immigrants to be counted in 2010 Census&rdquo; </p>
<p>https://www.nctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/article_de20ce78-e5e6-526a-b0c5-2e8fb1dbe7b0.html?mode=story</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describing themselves on the U.S. census form is a hard job for the indigenous immigrants. The 2010 survey hopes to make this process much easier by giving them an easier immigration status to fill in the form. The survey will also help by tallying all the indigenous immigrants in America for the first time ever. </p>
<p>The immigration status of the indigenous immigrants is at a bad state because they are discriminated both in their home country and the USA for their origin. Their origin becomes a question because it can cover multiple census categories and all of them speak different languages, which makes it harder for them to be united as one. </p>
<p>The federal government will use the results of the 2010 census to allocate funds to the state and for the betterment of the indigenous immigrant population in America. Therefore several indigenous organizations are organizing workshops, public forums and radio broadcasts to make the indigenous immigrant population come out and participate in the 2010 census. Because of this more and more indigenous immigrants will be encouraged to come out in public and claim their ethnic identity. </p>
<p>The 2010 census will benefit the indigenous immigrant population by reforming their immigration status for the better. This will also improve the quality of life of the indigenous immigrants living in the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
