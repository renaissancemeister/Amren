<h1>Muslim &amp; Latino Alliance on Immigration Rights</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Muslim American Society, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The failure of the United States to embrace a comprehensive immigration policy has caused multiple forms of displacement and even oppression for countless people in America. No community has been more greatly impacted by this issue than the Muslim and Hispanic community. Families have been separated as a result of deportation; profiling is rampant; documented and legal immigrants have been subjected to harassment, imprisonment and even violence; and undocumented workers contributing vital support to the US economy are unsure about their future in the United States or a certain path to permanent residency or citizenship.</p>
<p>MAS Freedom believes that immigration reform should balance the need for compliance with the law and the well being of immigrant workers and their families. We call for a fair and human immigration policy that does not target or demonize individuals and families who contribute valuable work and service to our economy and our society.</p>
<p>A key tactical approach to ameliorating the injustice and prejudices that immigrants face is by building a strong coalition between the Muslim and Latino community on immigrant rights. MAS Freedom encourages our MAS chapters, members, other Muslim organizations and mosques to reach out to credible immigrant right organizations within the Latino community as well as organizations like Interfaith Workers Justice. Building a coalition based on integrity and principles of cooperation could go a long way in addressing social and economic justice issues and the political empowerment of both communities. We encourage the American Muslim community to reach out, not only to the Latino community concerning immigration issues but also to other ethnic communities like the African American community and their civil rights experiences. History has shown that the success of minorities in America hinge upon their ability to move beyond isolation and build tactical alliances with other minority groups.</p>

								<h2>Congresswoman Sue Myrick Diagnosed with Dobb&rsquo;s Disease</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Muslim American Society, March 11, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>After three terms in office, Sue Myrick has been diagnosed with &#8216;Lou Dobb&rsquo;s&rsquo; disease. The first Republican woman to represent North Carolina in the U.S. Congress, her symptoms include being one of the most intolerant women in the U.S. Congress. Congresswoman Sue Myrick, also serves on the board of advisors for a fringe right wing Christian group called the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools. NCBCPS is an organization whose stated goal is to combat social regression by implementing state certified Bible courses in public schools. Click here for more info.</p>
<p>Unable to distinguish between mainstream Muslims and the radical fringe, her religious and racially biased attacks have progressed to include illiberal attacks on the Hispanic population.</p>
<p>A progressive moral degenerative disease, Dobb&rsquo;s disorder is named for Lou Dobbs, former xenophobic CNN reporter, who attributed a startling rise in leprosy cases to illegal immigrants from Latin America.</p>
<p>When the moral neurons die, the ability of the brain to control bigotry is lost.</p>
<p>This ailment has several symptoms; including stiffness of the heart and masked hatred. Following nationwide protest for immigration reform, Congresswoman Sue Myrick (R) NC swore to continue her fight for 287(g); the regulation that allows for law enforcement harassment of foreign &#8220;looking&#8221; citizens, and detain those without immigration documents. She has vowed to dedicate herself to the &#8220;stop and deport&#8221; tool, created to isolate and intimidate particular classes of people.</p>
<p>Representative Myrick admits, openly, to her toxic-laced concerns, &#8220;The administration&hellip; is laying the ground work frankly to gut the 287(g) program&hellip;giving up on the fight on illegal immigration. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indicators include ignoring the common good, for self-righteousness; in addition jingoistic and acutely distorted.</p>
<p>Along with a limited capacity to tolerate and include others i.e.  Muslim congressional interns, consistent with Congresswoman Myrick&rsquo;s disease, is a decreased ability to move the muscles of the face, resulting in hardheadedness and narrow constraints  in political and humanitarian views; which left untreated can result in the acute violation of multiple constitutional rights, leading to the legally sanctioned mistreatment of others. In a moment of incoherency, Sue Myrick wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi to ensure that emergency medical care is not extended to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>While there is not a sure cure that halts or reverses this type of discrimination, democracy modestly slows the progression of immigrant bashing and intolerance. Recognition of the fact that there are millions of undocumented immigrants sweating their lives away on farms, in restaurants, living without hope or future with low wages and little hope may give way to a lasting cure and open the minds of our leaders; the same people spending billions on war machines while poverty and ignorance continue at home; those willing to fight a war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but unwilling to fight with one-hundredth the money on an immigration reform packet to secure economic freedom or safe labor on this nations farmlands.</p>
<p>If congresspersons like Sue Myrick can support the recruitment of undocumented persons to serve in this nation&rsquo;s military, she can push for the kind of reform that gives them equal access to it. Such an offer made by our federal government lacks a moral choice when it says, &#8220;In war you will be an American citizen, but in the meantime you&rsquo;re an illegal and we can&rsquo;t help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cure lacks in recognizing the full human equality of all of our people  &mdash;  before God, before the law, and in the legislative body of government. Pray for Sue Myrick, pray for the cure! We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God command it, although they do. We must do it for the single and primary reason that it is the decent thing to do.<br>

		<p>Muslims calling other people intolerant.  That&rsquo;s rich!  Gimme a break.  WE don&rsquo;t cut off the hands of petty thieves, nor do we beat our women if they show their faces.  Nor do we assume a woman not covered from heat to toe by a tent a common whore and treat her so,  or rape her.  No other religion in the world commands armed conquest of all other religions, nor do we encourage our children and women and more dim witted citizens to strap dynamite on themselves and kill &#8220;infidels&#8221;.  This new campaign to align with disaffected hispanics and blacks has one purpose:  using them as a fifth column to get muslim terrorists into our country.  Looser immigration facilitates terrorists sneaking in.  Tighter immigration and enforcement makes it harder for terrorists to get into our country.</p>

		<p>FBI, if you&rsquo;re reading this:  Investigate the funding sources of the Muslim &amp; Latino Alliance on Immigration Rights.  Dig deep.  You will likely find one or more of three things behind it:  (1) Soros.  (2) Saudi Arabia or other Arab/Muslim world oil money.  (3) Hispanic drug gangs.</p>
<p>That Hispanics and Muslims want to cooperate on amnesty does not surprise me.  They cooperated on 9/11.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The failure of the United States to embrace a comprehensive immigration policy has caused multiple forms of displacement and even oppression for countless people in America. No community has been more greatly impacted by this issue than the Muslim and Hispanic community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How odd, since I &ldquo;always&rdquo; thought Hispanics (because of their &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; religious heritage) might have more in common with us &ldquo;gringos!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed we do not, nor ever shall we.</p>
<p>Since these &ldquo;wise&rdquo; Latinos see &ldquo;eye to eye,&rdquo; with these &ldquo;divine&rdquo; Muslims about such issues as: &ldquo;forms of displacement and even oppression&rdquo; that are so erroneously absurd, as to be considered in conjunction with a baboons nose picking musings, it is clear that their joined &ldquo;spirituality&rdquo; is to be questioned totally. Islam, after all, is not just the West&rsquo;s enemy, but all of Christendom&rsquo;s. Once that questioning is evidently justified, guilt by association is logically a crime of kind, not convenience for Latinos, be they &#8220;wise&#8221; or otherwise.</p>
<p>Or, put another way: &ldquo;forms of displacement and even oppression,&rdquo; are what they want for us decent whites, so as to fill in the gap for their collective psychopathologies that deem them our &ldquo;equals,&rdquo; if only in oddly rainbow theory only. That is until a total white genocide is a reality, and Muslim/Latino &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; has no other excuse but as to why they must fight for &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in their &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; Post-White &ldquo;wonderland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God help the blacks, as no whites will be left to do that injustice to themselves either; or even pray for it, anymore!</p>
<p>MLK save them all, as is so justly deserved!!!</p>

		<p>Immigrants have not seemed to grasp the concept that the place they came to (America) is so desirable because it was well-run, was orderly and had a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>I say &#8216;was&rsquo; because we all know that&rsquo;s going down the tubes.</p>
<p>Unchecked immigration lowers everyone&rsquo;s standard of living, including that of immigrants.  When America is a hell hole in 20 years, those same immigrants will pull up stakes and go elsewhere, leaving their own behind to torment us.</p>

		<p>4 John PM:</p>
<p>I read the first line from the article you quoted.  One could also say that the failure of the United States to adopt comprehensive homicide reform has resulted in many murder victims and many murder convicts in prison, not to mention many detached families, because father or brother is sitting in prison.  The obvious answer is comprehensive homicide reform.  That way, there will be no more murder victims, and no more innocent people who got caught up with the wrong crowd going off to prison for having committed murder, and never more shall murderer and child be parted.</p>
<p>This line from the second article grabbed me:</p>
<p><i>Unable to distinguish between mainstream Muslims and the radical fringe, her religious and racially biased attacks have progressed to include illiberal attacks on the Hispanic population.</i></p>
<p>This comes from something called &#8220;Muslim American society.&#8221;  The irony is that they and other groups like the CAIR want us infidels to distinguish between &#8220;mainstream&#8221; Muslims and the radical fringe, but they don&rsquo;t.  When some member of the &#8220;radical fringe&#8221; shoots up an Army base or flies airliners into buildings, the Muslim American Socieites and CAIR circle the wagons, and they also doggedly oppose any efforts to crack down on the radical fringe.  </p>

<p>With all do respect, you missed my point in citing this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The failure of the United States to embrace a comprehensive immigration policy has caused multiple forms of displacement and even oppression for countless people in America. No community has been more greatly impacted by this issue than the Muslim and Hispanic community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was to cynically and with the most molasses based dripping sarcasms, to point out  what they complain about, and we so ignorantly ignore. The words are so poignant (i.e., &ldquo;displacement and even oppression&hellip;&rdquo;) that no one with a brain can miss the irony.</p>
<p>A USA from 89% white to 64% white, only a decade into the century&rsquo;s turn; or a Europe that once was 99.999999999% white to only 84% white in the same timeframe?</p>
<p>&ldquo;displacement and even oppression&rdquo;&hellip;of whom?</p>
<p>I think you make a similar point, with the &ldquo;comprehensive homicide reform&rdquo; points you make; however, I felt I needed to clarify mine in context.  </p>
<p>To get the joke/point: </p>

		<p>Boy are all those Mexicans gonna get a surprise when their &#8220;allies&#8221; the Muslims turn on them and say, &#8220;Infidel - convert or die!!&#8221;  They have no idea that Muslims have only 3 options for dealing with infidels (that&rsquo;s anyone who isn&rsquo;t Muslim):  (1) Convert them; (2) Reduce them to 2nd class citizenship (dhimmi status); OR (3) kill them.  It&rsquo;s all right there in the Medinan section of the Holy Qur&rsquo;an AND in the hadith writings, which are considered equal to the Qur&rsquo;an.  Buena suerte, o Mexicans&hellip;.</p>

		<p>A well-educated, secular Muslim can be a very good American. Our problem is that we are not discriminating enough in the kinds of Muslims we let in. Most Yemenis and Somalis, for example, are much too backwards to assimilate to our culture. <br>
New blood is not a bad thing for our country. But it should be the very best blood  &mdash;  not a swarm of eighth-grade drop-outs from our nearest neighbor, but the world&rsquo;s best scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. I would of course prefer that these new arrivals be white  &mdash;  which they would usually be if they come from countries such as Turkey, Afghanistan, Argentina, etc. </p>

All these groups know it.  They are prepping to feed on our dead carcass.  All these other groups are getting ready to take from us that which we have built - and it&rsquo;s not just here in the U.S. either - it&rsquo;s all over the White world.  Muslims joining with Hispanics to destroy us.  Who could have conceived such a thing 40 years ago?!  And these are just the beginning stages.  Wait a couple of decades down the road when we&rsquo;re a minority.  Wait until we&rsquo;re minorities in all the countries of Europe where indigenous Whites are driven from their own countries.  There is incredible trouble for us brewing, and it&rsquo;s only over the next hill.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying for a long time, we can do without the M and M&rsquo;s<br>
in our midst. Will we fight against continued unchecked immigration or will we fight for a sustainable country with only people who respect us and our laws? If the latter is your idea of a true America, keep calling, writing and faxing your representatives. If you don&rsquo;t like what they&rsquo;re doing - vote them out and keep voting until we get someone who truly represents us and is not in the back pocket of those who profit from turning our country into the next third world nation. Hopefully, the next march for &#8220;illegal rights&#8221; will spur others to demand that not only will amnesty not be passed, we will demand that deportations begin. I&rsquo;ve always failed to see why that&rsquo;s so difficult. If we had a President who cared about the millions of unemployed Americans, he&rsquo;d announce to the world that &#8220;we&rsquo;re no longer the dumping ground, and that all illegals must leave. If not, they go into stockades, built on the Mexican side of the border. Build a double-layered fence, mandate E-verify, and stop all benefits, especially the insane birthright provision. Then put a 10-year moratorium on ALL immigration. They would leave the same way they came. But that&rsquo;s entirely too easy. For a country that once could do anything, we can&rsquo;t even stop an invasion of criminals who sneak in daily and overwhelm us with their sheer numbers. Mr. O, are you listening yet?</p>

		<p>The 30 million immigrants who have arrived in the last quarter century are overwhelmingly from non-European third world societies, and as a whole they bring with them many of the ideas, habits, and manners that make their native countries Third World in character: the lack of a work ethic, an inclination toward authoritarian and often violent political behavior, and an unfamiliarity and uneasiness with the religious, educational, hygienic, scientific, and moral conventions that most Americans take for granted.</p>

What they don&rsquo;t understand is that when White people go, they(non-Whites) won&rsquo;t be able to maintain what White people have built and the society will revert back to the one they left behind.</p>

<p>That is exactly what will come to pass if clueless white liberals and their non-white allies continue to get their way in flooding countries that were once predominately white with loads of brown and black people. The reason whites were able to create &#8220;the good life&#8221; in their own respective countries is that a sufficient number of them were genetically programmed to possess the intellect required to create and maintain an advanced civilization. With the exception of the Oriental race, no other popualtion group is capable of that task. </p>

		<p>There are quite a number of Arabs or persons of Arab descent in Mexico today.  Their ancestors migrated there from Syria, Turkey, Lebanon about a century ago, during Ottoman times, and many of them are today very wealthy and politically powerful. They are very shrewd at business. I understand they are both Christians and Moslems, and some are probably Jews as well.  Example: Carlos Slim, presently the world&rsquo;s wealthiest man, is one of them.  I have known several, and despite their completely Mexican exterior, they are still loyal to their Middle Eastern roots.</p>

 </p>
<p>My eyes spotted this peculiar wording immediately. How interesting that the writer [the Muslim American Society] chooses to speak of their combined &#8220;community&#8221; (in the singular) as a unit, instead of being two quite distinct &#8220;communities&#8221; &hellip; each with separate cultures, histories, backgrounds, and interests.  And especially, religions!   <br>

		<p>Telemundo, the second largest Spanish TV network, owned by NBC / GE started a new novella (evening soap opera) a few weeks ago which is set in Morocco.  The story includes a love triangle between &#8220;Arabs&#8221; and Latinos and one character who is a CLONED HUMAN.  The point seems to be to make the Arab culture look sympathetic and wonderful to Latino culture.  As far as the clone I have not figured that one out yet.  The show is called El Clone.</p>

		<p>Articles like this make me sick.</p>
<p>But it is the prevailing wisdom among &#8216;immigrants&rsquo;, legal or otherwise, and non-Whites.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;caused multiple forms of displacement and even oppression for countless people in America&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it is NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS who are being displaced, who are being forced by the USG to render our living space and the civilization WE created in our image, according to the needs of OUR DNA, temperament and intellect to YOU.  What you see here, what you non-White immigrants envy and desire was created by Whites, it didn&rsquo;t just appear from nowhere as the msm and academia would like you to believe.</p>
<p>We are forced to pay for the welfare you demand and medical treatment you need.  We are forced to educate and even cater to your children and provide services to them at the expense of our own children.  We are forced to pay for your housing which the USG demands be put in our peaceful, safe neighborhoods.  You are &#8216;others&rsquo; to us, unlike us, with different laws, traditions and mores and we are suspicious of you, with good reason.</p>
<p>Those in the government who demand that we Whites turn over our land and treasure to you do not choose to live near you.  They prefer to live with those of their own kind in peaceful, safe neighborhoods  &mdash;  surrounded by gates, alarms and guards.  Some, like diane feinstein, have CCW permits, something she makes sure we kulaks can&rsquo;t have in California.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you stay in your own country?</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;No community has been more greatly impacted by this issue than the Muslim and Hispanic community (sic). Families have been separated as a result of deportation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Too bad.  You take that chance when you enter our country and break our laws.  If your family is separated because you broke American laws, it is your own fault and you deserve to be deported.</p>
<p>Why do you think you are above American law?</p>
<p>If I were to break the law in YOUR Third World country would anyone ever see me alive again?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;profiling is rampant; documented and legal immigrants have been subjected to harassment, imprisonment and even violence&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then don&rsquo;t come here if you don&rsquo;t want to be profiled, harassed, imprisoned or a victim of violence.  Is that not the obvious solution?</p>
<p>If you are hispanic, your crime rate is approximately two to three times that of Native Born American Whites.  Therefore, you should be profiled, and often.  If you don&rsquo;t like it how about putting pressure on YOUR community to abide by American Laws?</p>
<p>According to economic consultant Ed Rubenstein:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Reliable data show that Hispanics are rapidly catching up to blacks as the most violent demographic in the U.S&hellip;Overall, the number of prisoners doing time for murder fell by nearly 8% during the 2000 to 2006 period&hellip;.Only Hispanics bucked the trend: 13,400 more Hispanic murderers were in prison in 2006 than 2000 &mdash; a whopping 57% increase. As far as murder is concerned, the new boys on the cell block are overwhelmingly Hispanic&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>You write of violence?  You mean like the violence committed by muslims against gays in San Francisco?:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Three Muslim men have been charged with a hate crime and assault for attacking a gay man in San Francisco. One of the attackers shot the victim in the face with a BB gun from a moving car while one of his companions videotaped the attack&hellip; Investigators believe the victim was targeted because he appeared gay.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney, Victor Hwang, hinted that the three Muslim men were involved in other attacks.</p>
<p>The msm, believing the victims were &#8216;only straight White males&rsquo; sat on the story for several days. </p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing in San Francisco is a clash of competing victim groups&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; undocumented workers contributing vital support to the US economy are unsure about their future in the United States or a certain path to permanent residency or citizenship&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  </p>
<p>Undocumented workers pull far more out of the economy than they contribute to it.  California is going under because a flood of unwelcome, unwanted illegal immigrants demand services which our government provides to them.  The government has no money and must extract it from productive White citizens who are fleeing the state due to high taxes, hospital emergency rooms closures, schools being destroyed, neighborhoods becoming more dangerous and the severely decreased quality of life.</p>
<p>According to the article &#8220;Racing Backwards &mdash; The Fiscal Impact of Illegal Immigration in California, Revisited&#8221; (Summer 2007)].</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; California&rsquo;s illegals receive from $9.6 billion to $38.2 billion more state services than they pay in state taxes. His median estimate &mdash; $21.2 billion in 2005 &mdash; equals nearly 22 percent of state spending&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/ybxdbey" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/ybxdbey</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a novel idea:  How about not coming to our country legally or illegally? </p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t have to worry about being profiled, harassed or separated from your family.</p>
<p>If your country is a Fourth World hell-hole how about working to make it a better place for your own people?  Americans have always been generous, I&rsquo;m sure there would be enough willing to help your people build a sustainable civilization.</p>
<p>Stay out of ours.</p>

		<p>C #11   &mdash;   there is no such thing as a &#8220;secular&#8221; Muslim.  Their religion demands that its adherents be 100% dedicated to Islam first, last, and in the middle.  Everything else is secondary.  That is why they are so dangerous - they will do ANYTHING to win over the infidels and eventually rule the world.  Unless we stop them of course.</p>

		<p>I am not worried about openly Muslim Mexicans.  I am very concerned about the crypto Muslims our federal government and the governments all over Europe.  I believe they are more numerous than any of us want to believe.  </p>
<p>Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler were big fans of the Muslim religion with its &#8220;might makes right&#8221; philosophy and wished to see it take over Europe.  I think there are many more petty government dictators who like Islam than we think. </p>
<p>Governments in every White nation of the world are dissolving the people and electing a new one.  I also believe they are throwing Jehovah out of office to replace Him with Allah who is far more appreciative of the perks of political power than Jehovah was.  When our government start installing foot baths in airport rest rooms, in defiance of the establishment clause of the First Amendment than they know something we don&rsquo;t want to know.  </p>
<p>A &#8220;soft jihad&#8221; is being waged somewhat in Europe and especially in America with its armed citizenry forcing Muslims to behave themselves and not rape the populace.  I believe that WNists need to keep their ear to the ground, because TIIC are hell-bent on making the world go Muslim.<br>

		<p>Keep writing our representatives in Congress about immigration policies.  That sounds good and may work in some places in the USA but here in Illinois, it&rsquo;s a waste of time as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.  I&rsquo;ve written Senator Durbin (D-IL) about the fact that the Bill and Melinda Gates Scholarship Fund excludes Caucasians entirely and asked his thoughts on the subject.  That was about three weeks ago and I&rsquo;m still waiting for an answer.  I&rsquo;m afraid that he and his colleagues in the Senate all feel the same way.  They are for unlimited immigration into this country by non-whites, just as the master-mind behind the 1965 Immigration policy, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) was along with his brothers, John F. Kennedy.  That 1965 Immigration Act was and is the root cause of the problem we have today.</p>

		<p>These two groups don&rsquo;t have much in common other than immigration. I prefer the Hispanic over the Muslim culture. Hispanic women are allowed (and encouraged) to look pretty and feminine.  Muslim women must cover themselves with those scary looking burkahs. Plus the Muslims want the whole world to convert to Islam.</p>
<p> Muslims are a much greater threat to our freedom and way of life although I don&rsquo;t appreciate how Hispanics take advantage and drain our welfare state. </p>
