			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Independent (Dublin), March 25 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women and children seeking asylum are living in overcrowded and outdated centres where they fear for their safety and face intimidation and racism, it was claimed.</p>
<p>An African women&rsquo;s group maintained residents are sexually harassed and are in fear of private management firms who control the country&rsquo;s 52 reception centres.</p>
<p>Salome Mbugua, of AkiDwA, which means sisterhood in swahili, said there was a feeling a helplessness and hopelessness among mothers, and called on Government to take more responsibility over the running of the units.</p>
<p>&#8220;The safety and security of women and their children is paramount,&#8221; Ms Mbugua said.</p>
<p>AkiDwA said almost 3,000 women and young girls live in reception centres while their application for asylum is being processed  &mdash;  some for up to six years.</p>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s new report on conditions highlighted a lack of appropriate staffing, training and Garda vetting.</p>
<p>The study  &mdash;  Am Only Saying It Now  &mdash;  also revealed long stays in centres had a huge impact on the physical and mental health of women and children.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees, with the running contracted to private management firms.</p>
<p>Ms Mbugua recommended Government has an independent audit of its policy on direct care provision, require all centre staff undergo mandatory training and Garda vetting, and create a transparent, independent and confidential complaints mechanism.</p>
<p>Catherine Joyce, of children&rsquo;s charity Barnardos, said she was concerned about the impact the direct provision system is having on children.<br>

You know where they wouldn&rsquo;t face racism? Africa.</p>
<p>Stamp the applications &#8216;Asylum Denied&rsquo; and give them a one-way ticket home.</p>

		<p>The solution seems simple; if they are unhappy, they should go home. I am sure that their african countrymen will treat them with all the care and respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>Perhaps then the Irish government will allocate the money spent on these &#8220;refugees&#8221; to deserving Irish citizens. </p>

		<p>Now how long before the Ireland of the &#8220;Quiet Man&#8221; era is gone forever?  Already the larger cities have the same dangers for tourists the world over.  Africans and muslims will target white tourists unaware of the changing Ireland.  Stick to the countryside where the Ireland we all knew still exists.</p>

		<p>I doubt entirely if white men are any danger to these African women. No way are white men out looking to sexually harrass third world black sub 80 IQ unwashed women.<br>
Must be black men in those camps.<br>
And as to the complaints;<br>
&#8220;rescue us, take us in, feed us, house us, clothe us, give us money, give us new apartments, find us jobs, make sure we don&rsquo;t have to compete, pay for our baby factories, educate us, but don&rsquo;t expect anything in the way of learning, hear all our cries and complaints, let us fill your courts, pay for our lawyers, give us cash and preferential treatment, punish anyone who does not honor us with special treatment, outlaw and jail any who dare to resent our onerous presence&hellip;<br>
Here&rsquo;s an alternative reply.<br>
Go the hell back to the dungheap you came from.</p>

		<p>Three-thousand women and young girls. Think about all the children they&rsquo;ll produce over the next fifty years, all the grandchildren THEY&rsquo;LL produce, all the resources they&rsquo;ll consume, all the crime they&rsquo;ll commit.</p>
<p>These aylum seekers are literally a genetic time-bomb.</p>

		<p>Salome Mbugua, you are getting far more than what you would have got from the place you escaped from. White people are allowing you into their advanced and more orderly countries, all built and planned by White people, something your race is not capable of doing. You and your children are most probably going to help destroy these same benevolent countries which have made the mistake to allow you and your kind in. Why should these nations take you inside their territories in the first place.? And if they are so racist why not send you to Uganda or Haiti where the people are not racist and evil like White people? <br>

		<p>Send them back Asap. I doubt if they have a legitimate claim for asylum anyway and are just economic migrants. You notice that they do not seek asylum in South Africa, Kenya or Nigeria. The Muslims are not seeking asylum in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or Dubai. I wonder why? These people do not wish to assimilate and become Irish citizens, they want to live in the rain forest and be supported by a guilt ridden white government. </p>
