<h1>Brawl Erupts at Sentencing of Mom Who Gave Gun to Son</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Swickard, Detroit Free Press, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A murderer and her supporters battled in a Detroit courtroom this morning as she was ordered to serve more than 22 years in prison for giving her teenage son a gun that he used to kill another teen at a recreation center.</p>
<p>Tarranisha Davis &#8220;basically just went ballistic,&#8221; said Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Ryan who presided over her trial with her son and co-defendant Tremain.</p>
<p>The woman &#8220;was punching yelling and screaming&#8221; as court security officers and Detroit policemen who were in the courtroom tried to control her, Ryan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then these other people jumped over the railing and start fighting, too,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;It spilled into the hallway.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The uproar came as Ryan ordered Tarranisha Davis to serve 221/2  &mdash;  to-40 years for second degree murder and an additional two years for using a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>
<p>Her son Tremaine, 15, was ordered to serve 10-to-25 years for second degree murder plus another two years for use of a firearm. He will be in a juvenile facility until he is 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave him that sentence because he has been respectful and remorseful since Day-One,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;His mother, though, has shown no remorse at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother and son were charged in the fatal shooting of Dmitri Jackson, 19, at the Considine Little Rock Family Center in October. </p>
<p>Authorities charge that Tarranisha Davis supplied a gun to her son, who had fought with another youth but killed Jackson by shooting in a crowd of teenagers at the center.</p>

		<p>  The story speaks for itself, and look at their mugshots.  I am sure they were well educated in the Detroit school system. Total mob mentality, give me, give me, entitlement thinking.  I was oppressed.  It is there for everyone and they still, skew the facts.  Watch out white people, they are more violent and vocal. Never underestimate the power of stupidity in crowds, thx Mike</p>

		<p>Typical behavior.  Both in the crime, and in the court room.  The reason she probably went ballistic was due to thinking she was going to get off resulting from jury nullification.  Blacks on the jury.  It was Detroit, after all.  And, an additional reason being that blacks just have NO concept of right and wrong.  If they did, she&rsquo;d not be in court with her son.  The fact that she WAS in court with her son indicates the kind of hateful upbringing she imparted to her thug son.  Thug-ess trains up thug son to commit murder before he is old enough to legally drive.   And they wonder why we want to be as far away from them as possible?</p>

		<p>The murder happened in a recreation center.  The lame brained Mayor of St. Louis thinks that recreation centers are the way to reduce violent crime.  It seems to me that there are more crimes in rec centers, all other things being equal, than there is outside of them.</p>
<p>Bad choice of words for the judge to describe Miss Davis&rsquo;s outburst as &#8220;ballistic,&#8221; don&rsquo;t you think?  Speaking of the judge, he said that he gave Mr. Davis the lenient sentence because he was &#8220;respectful and remorseful.&#8221;  As &#8220;respectful&#8221; and &#8220;remorseful&#8221; as he may be, his victim is still dead.</p>

		<p>Blacks are well known for their histrionics and temper tantrums, but can they really FIGHT?  See this video, and decide for yourself.  Throwing the race card and blowing hot air got this black punk nowhere - except, maybe down on the bus floor?  Serves him right for messing around with a white Vietnam vet:</p>

<p>Right. Exactly. She thought SHE WAS THE ONE BEING WRONGED. She thought that with all her supporters she would WALK. Everyone that participated in that riot should be sentenced to prison time for contempt of court. This sort of stuff happens more and more frequently. Judges say that people act emotionally during the sentencing. Well, no excuse. Sentence them all to years for contempt.</p>

<p>They can certainly fight better than whites. When a neighborhood gets a noticeable number of blacks, whites often flee the neighborhood. </p>
<p>But in Los Angeles and elsewhere, Hispanics have proven to be tougher than blacks. When Hispanics move to a tough black neighborhood, they are not intimidated by black thugs. Hispanics are quickly taking over South Central LA, and Hispanic gangs are so tough, that they have caused the black Crips and the Bloods gangs to flee.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you put Indo-Pakistanis in your fighting hierarchy but I disagree with your contention. White flight is due to fear for their families and children and a desire to try to preserve a decent quality of life which becomes impossible when blacks reach a critical threshold. Also Hispanics don&rsquo;t have a lot to lose by being around blacks (they often come from foreign countries and have a culture and mentality just as depraved) and are not hamstrung by &#8220;hate laws&#8221; and political correctness.</p>

		<p>9 DeepakNPatel: Whites can fight.  But the law and the press are against us in many places.  Notice how any action by a White against a Black is magnified, and horrific crimes against Whites by Blacks are ignored?  The hanging of a noose, even the drawing of a picture of a noose, gets national coverage, while the torture-murders of Whites are strictly local news.  The ruling classes are so desperate for a real White villain that, last summer, they dragged out a ten year old murder in Texas and made a big whoopie about the ten year anniversary of the dragging death of a Black felon by three White felons.   Any White who defends himself against a non-White had better be prepared to defend himself again from the courts and the news media.  Just what are your chances of escaping arrest when some FBI Hate Task Force drags out all their best forensic technology to find the &#8220;hate killer&#8221;?  What chance have you with a non-White jury when the prosecutor proves that you are racist killer because you post on AmRen?  A pistol permit might keep the police from arresting you for carrying the gun, but not for using it in self defense against a non-White when you&rsquo;re outside your house.  Our cities are not occupied by non-Whites, they are ruled by Reds.  The non-Whites are only tools.  </p>

		<p>Ref #9, the average Latino certainly doesn&rsquo;t look like much; I could probably take three of them on similtaneously. Apparently there&rsquo;s more to dealing effectively with blacks than artful one-on-one fisticuffs. Like blacks themselves, Latinos aren&rsquo;t interested in a fair fight. They&rsquo;ll bring whatever they can carry with as many as they can muster, and they&rsquo;re better organized than blacks.</p>
<p>The trouble with us whites is that we&rsquo;re way too concerned with fairness. Imagine what WE could do if we set our minds and numbers to it!</p>

		<p>Article in if my memory serves me right, in Friday Telegraph,London, that says whites to be a minority due to falling birth rates among whites and an increase in births among immigrants here. That&rsquo;s on top of the new immigrants streaming to these shores and lets be realistic please. Most of the newer ppl are not all coming from Eastern Europe, although their numbers are up since the open border/EU mandate. I understand the same is true in the USA as well and for much the same reasons. Doesn&rsquo;t look like things are going to get much better.  Neither the USA or the UK generally get the sort of immigrants that came over in the earlier part of the last century.</p>

		<p>Notice how this amazingly socially ignorant judge awarded the boy a lesser sentence because he was polite.  </p>
<p>Uh, judge, that&rsquo;s called &#8220;behaving&#8221;, and the young criminal that stood before you murdered another teen.  His victim is dead, judge.  </p>
<p>This judge rewarded the boy due to the latter acting normal.  Unbelieveable.</p>
<p>Not to worry, folks.  The young&rsquo;n will be back before another judge sometime in the future for yet another offense.  And another and another&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Taking into account the remorse shown by a defendant is commonplace, regardless of the defendant&rsquo;s race. And count me in as one of the people that thinks blacks, in general, are tougher than whites. Yes, there are exceptions (just as there are bad whites and good blacks, but in general the opposite is true), but blacks are generally tougher. Than again, I couldn&rsquo;t fight my way out of a paper bag, so what do I know?</p>

<p>Patel: &#8220;They can certainly fight better than whites. When a neighborhood gets a noticeable number of blacks, whites often flee the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites have conquered the world on the battlefield for centuries.  To say whites can&rsquo;t fight reveals an asinine assessment based in hatred of whites, not credible evidence. </p>
<p>And if whites can&rsquo;t fight, how badly is the assessment of Indians, since the tiny kingdom of Britain conquered all of India and kept its population in check for quite a long time, until an ideology called &#8220;passive resistance&#8221; was employed which amounted to timid submission?  Indians could never defeat Britain&rsquo;s white warriors.  </p>
<p>And, before you tell us how great you think blacks are, better understand that they terrorize Indians wherever each group lives in close proximity to one another.  </p>
<p>Too, the national I.Q. of India is 81, 4 points lower than American blacks.  </p>

 Deepak patel was talking more to the now, not 400 years ago and it goes back to what school teacher said and nothing to do with whites ability to be barbaric, sure enough they ruled a peace loving people. I would really like for you to give me an example of where Hindus attacked another country and tried to impose their philosophy. Yet Hindu philosophy which includes Budhism without any bloodshed is the most prevelant worldwide. By the way people of Indian origin still have the highest per capita income, go figure. </p>

		<p>the guru,</p>
<p>After reading your post a few times I don&rsquo;t understand your point.  Quite frankly, I am sick of sympathetic posts coming from people on this forum in regards to Indians.  I don&rsquo;t care if they have the highest per capita income in our country.  That doesn&rsquo;t take away from anything the other poster said.  </p>
<p>Just because a small percentage of their best and brightest come here and do well, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that India overall has a successful population.  This should be quite obvious.  Just read an article on the country or watch a National Geographic documentary on the place.</p>
<p>All of this aside, Indians aren&rsquo;t white and they don&rsquo;t belong in our countries.  End of discussion.</p>
<p>I noticed how you added this&hellip;.&#8221;whites ability to be barbaric&#8221;.  What is that supposed to mean? Who&rsquo;s side are you on here?  Are you on a mission to make whites look bad at any chance you get so you can defend these poor little Indians?  </p>
<p>Enough of this already.  It is time for whites to start spending time focusing on the well being of their own.  I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Indians are from people like you.  I have been around a bunch of them and I am not very impressed.  </p>
<p>If I want to be around them I will be happy to visit India and appreciate them for what they are.  But as far as observing them in white countries&hellip;.I am sorry&hellip;.they just don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>And if you want to know one reason I am so flustered over this, it is because I have read some of the great and mighty DeepakNPatel&rsquo;s other posts, and he really isn&rsquo;t the type of person that any white person who is true to the purpose of this website should be supporting.  He puts whites down and brags on Indians when he can.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of this we WHITES invented such things as guns and ORGANIZATION and blacks didn&rsquo;t even have BOWS and ARROWS until Whites showed them, only sharp sticks! Blacks and Arabs cannot take orders from each other, not even if they are from the same tribe and make no mistake, ALL blacks and ALL Arabs are from one tribe or another and race comes first and then tribe with all of the above against the White race.</p>

		<p>I wonder if anyone has ever measured the testosterone levels of African descent females? We know that young Black males have about a 20% higher T-level to account as a contributing factor to brawling. Black females would likewise seem to have a higher level than European descent females too? Post a link if you know of any research.</p>

		<p>Blacks better fighters than whites?  That&rsquo;s a hoot.</p>
<p>During the Congo rebellions and conflicts of the Sixties, roughly two hundred white mercenaries under Mike Hoare and Jean Schramm had no trouble setting to flight the 20,000 man Congolese rebel &#8220;army&#8221; at every turn.  The mere rumor of their approach was sufficient to begin the rout.</p>
<p>In the early history of the Boers, armed with simple flintlock muskets, and vastly outnumbered, defeated the vaunted Zulus in every engagement.</p>
<p>In contrast, the American Indians, confronted with white settlers similarly armed, gave a frighteningly good account of themselves in most instances.</p>
<p>Blacks better fighters than whites?  Or Chinese?  Or any number of other racial and ethnic groups?  Methinks not.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;The mother [Tarranisha Davis] and son [Tremaine Davis] were charged in the fatal shooting of Dmitri Jackson, 19, at the Considine Little Rock Family Center in October. </p>
<p>The way I see it, the planning, funding, and construction of a family recreation center represents white thinking and white culture. The way the center was used in this case is a glimpse into the general mentality of blacks. </p>
<p>Obviously, the black mentality is at odds with white culture. Let&rsquo;s face it: No amount of lofty rhetoric, no new series of federal mandates and social programs, and no additional billions of dollars will change that. </p>
<p> and all the programs and all the dollars devoted to &#8220;integration&#8221; over the years, blacks are tearing down white culture? <br>
