<h1>Indiana Store Apologizes For &#8216;No Burmese&rsquo; Sign</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Indianapolis Star, March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Fort Wayne business that posted a sign barring Burmese immigrants from entering could face a civil rights complaint.</p>
<p>Ricker Oil Co. president Jay Ricker has apologized for the sign posted by an employee and says the business welcomes all customers. But director Gerald Foday of Fort Wayne&rsquo;s Metropolitan Human Relations Commission says he is considering filing a complaint.</p>
<p>The sign attempted to bar Burmese people &#8220;for sanitary reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Wayne is home to about 5,000 Burmese, the largest concentration in the United States. Many chew betel nut and spit the residue, which can result in red stains.</p>

		<p>Why do some folks make it just too easy for civil rights groups to make themselves relevant? This falls under the category of, &#8220;Hello?&hellip;..You just can&rsquo;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>There must be some sort of disturbing the peace or littering ordinance where the store owner could file a criminal complaint against each and every violator, sending, in essence, the same message as the sign. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some will suggest a &#8220;no expectorating&#8221; sign, complete with an illustration. But a sign like that would make me lose my appetite and shop somewhere else almost as fast as the action itself.</p>

<p>Wow, lucky Fort Wayne!</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the normal &ldquo;spitting is unlawful&rdquo; statutes on the books?</p>
<p>Have they now only become applicable to whites, so as to allow Burmese and other nonwhites the joy of spreading their &ldquo;enriching diversity&rdquo; about, like a pollen in Eden?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>With our current economic crises, however, the Burmese will be a great asset.  Long known for their business acumen and technological prowess they should prove to be one of the few shining lanterns of prosperity.<br>

		<p>Freedom to hang any sign I choose on my property. Freedom to serve or reject any customer I choose. &#8220;No shirt No shoes No service&#8221; still means something, right? So if I can choose to serve or not serve based on that, why not further base my choices on other aspects I don&rsquo;t like and do not want in my buisness? Freedom means that someone will always be offended by something.</p>

		<p>I was surprised to read the total of 5,000. Seems pretty high for a town of about 50,000 folks. Ft. Wayne is not a big place, has a lot of RV industry, etc. But 1/10 of the populace is Burmese?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s most generous of the people of Fort Wayne to provide jobs and free healthcare to 5,000 people from Burma.  This gives hope to billions of poor people around the world who want to be among the next 5,000; or the 5,000 after that&hellip;</p>

<p>Justifier, they already have their &#8220;brown skinned slaves&#8221; in Marth&rsquo;s Vineyard. It has been reported here that those particular slaves are from Brazil. They are illegal aliens, as well (at least that is what I remember).<br>

One of the scheduled speakers at the 2010 Amren conference was going to explain how our immigration system works. Hopefully he&rsquo;ll contribute an article in a future edition of AR.</p>

		<p>The law must change so that private enterprise can discriminate in any manner chosen.  Much of the discrimination of the past, such as in the South, was a matter of convention.  Many business owners were probably glad when it ended, since all money is green.  Now, it&rsquo;s almost entirely bad behavior that businesses want to keep at bay, and customers CAN be ejected for it.  Of course, if one has a business in the ghetto, he knows he or his employees will have to put up with it.<br>
Some employees are no doubt afraid to eject unruly customers for fear of charges of racial discrimination.  If the latter were legalized, this fear would of course cease to exist.  And businesses would still be green-oriented, so most would still want all well-behaved customers.  </p>

<p>So&hellip; are drugstores still allowed to put up &#8220;Burma Shave&#8221; signs? Or is that now racist too? </p>

		<p>So much for the stereotype of the polite, well-mannered, and clean Asians!</p>
<p>Legally speaking, if you own a private business, it is now illegal to bar certain people form entering it?</p>
<p>I thought there were still clubs, in the South, were colored people and Jews were unwelcome. Things (and laws) change, I guess. And maybe such clubs and their policies didn&rsquo;t do what was morally right&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But, does this mean that, if you start a business of your own, in the US, but can&rsquo;t bar anyone; and if affirmative action quotas are applicable to private businesses, that at some point, sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll have to hire color people to work in your business?</p>

		<p>When I lived in Hong Kong, there was a specific season when the mainland Chinese would come and vacation in there. Mainland Chinese have different habits than the Chinese in Hong Kong, namely one that involves indiscriminate spitting. I watched as new signs in the YWCA hotel sprang up everywhere - the front lobby, the hallways, and even the elevators - that said &#8220;no spitting!&#8221; </p>
<p>The businesses in Indiana are not as experienced as those in Hong Kong in dealing with the different &#8220;customs&#8221; that international travelers bring with them. Like it or not, they&rsquo;re going to have to find someone who can print up signs for them in their native dialect to explain that spitting on the floor will result in their prompt removal from the restaurant. </p>

		<p>Are these real ethnic-Burmese in Indiana or tribal minority people or who?</p>
<p>If you have time, read Orwell&rsquo;s &#8216;Burmese Days and his short piece &#8216;Shooting an Elephant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From memory:</p>
<p>&#8220;In Moulmein, in lower Burma, I was widely hated&hellip;since this was the only time in my life I was sufficiently important for this to have happened, I should explain that I was a police officer &hellip; there was widespread nationalist sentiment &hellip; nobody had the guts to start a riot but if a European woman went to the bazaar, it would be certain that betel nut juice would be spat on her dress&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This nasty [ but said to be agreeable to the chwer] habit was widespread in Sarawak a generation ago, but now is seen only upriver among the over-65s and never in towns like Kabit, Sibu or Kuching.</p>

		<p>Why should they have to apologize?   I was in in Okinawa while in the Navy, among many other places just like it, but there they would put their arms in a &#8220;x&#8221; pattern to signal that now white&rsquo;s where allowed&hellip; I was offended at the time, but not anymore   &mdash;   the Japanese realize cultural preservation.</p>
<p>When I hear stories of this type, I laugh, because when you go over to those countries, like Japan and Singapore, you have a 100 percent chance of getting robbed (I got robbed twice). Maybe the American people should stop being so scared and stand up for the constitution that we created and not limit our rights &hellip;. Don&rsquo;t get me started on immigration.</p>

		<p>20 Bill Corr: If I recall correctly, these are part of a group of 60,000 Hindus that Burma didn&rsquo;t want.  I think they&rsquo;re probably some tribal minority or other.  India didn&rsquo;t want them either.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re refugees.  </p>

		<p>re:Francois-&#8220;Legally speaking, if you own a private business, it is now illegal to bar certain people form entering it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless someone is drunk and disorderly or causing a disturbance, you can&rsquo;t bar someone based on race, ethnicity etc. from entering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought there were still clubs, in the South, were colored people and Jews were unwelcome. Things (and laws) change, I guess. And maybe such clubs and their policies didn&rsquo;t do what was morally right&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>If something is a private club and NOT a business, they can be exclusive and only allow certain people. Such private clubs barring Blacks etc. in the past were not just in the South but in other parts of the country too, like New York. However today, such private clubs are rare and not socially acceptable as they are considered &#8220;racist&#8221;. However, private clubs for Blacks only are common and perfectly acceptable.</p>
