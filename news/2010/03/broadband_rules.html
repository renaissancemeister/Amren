			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Harry Alford, Enquirer (Cincinnati), March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}. America needs another injection of economic stimulus to lift our economy back off the mat and get it back into fighting shape.</p>
<p>Thankfully, President Barack Obama has backed broadband. As part of his American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Obama directed the federal government to invest $7.2 billion in bringing high-speed Internet access to Americans from the inner city to the family farm and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>We need this new investment in broadband because less than half of African-Americans homes currently subscribe, a fact that puts us at a severe disadvantage in terms of our ability to find and keep a job, control our own health care choices and educate our children. But if broadband were universal, one leading think tank estimates it could add $500 billion of economic activity every year  &mdash;  not to mention 1.2 million new jobs  &mdash;  all while empowering our families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the banner of &#8220;Internet openness,&#8221; some are proposing new regulations that threaten to increase the cost of broadband service at exactly the wrong time for our economy. {snip}</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really going on? Just like we&rsquo;ve seen again and again, a very powerful and influential group of companies is trying to play the American people in order to line their own pockets. It will cost money to ensure that the Internet can continue to offer an increasingly broad range of services in the coming years, as much as $350 billion. Someone will have to pay for this massive upgrade. But if the wealthy Internet companies get their way, they will commandeer the regulations to insulate them from paying any share of the improvements on which their profits depend. Instead, these special interests want to shift the costs onto consumers entirely.</p>

<p>I see how that works.  A half a terabuck yearly will be spent to clean up the damage to physical structures and human beings done by black wilding flash mobs organized on Twitter, because all the black teenagers now have an Uncle Sap-provided broadband line.</p>
<p>Question:  How did anyone find jobs, research health care choices and educate children back in the dial-up days, or (gasp!) even the pre-internet days?</p>
<p>Question:  Why is it assumed that everyone being on the internet will lead to increased personal productivity?  I tend to think that a lot of people waste their time on the internet.</p>
<p>By the way, there are a lot of rural white areas where broadband internet connections are not available, because the economics of building the physical structure just doesn&rsquo;t work.  I actually think that WiMax or something like that is the better bet for rural areas.  </p>

		<p> Aside from the blatantly editorializing headline (&#8220;Broadband Rules Target Black Families,&#8221;), this whole column is pure, unadulterated poppycock. If current Internet costs are $1 a day on average, why are less than half of black families subscribers? And where does Mr. Alford cite any proof that a &#8220;very powerful and influential group of companies&#8221; is trying to &#8220;play the American people in order to line their own pockets&#8221;? This sounds like &#8220;Liberal Class Warfare Talking Points 101.&#8221;</p>
<p> Mr. Alford gives his game away when he says, &#8220;But if broadband were universal &hellip;&#8221; Ah, ha! Just like health care in this Rube Goldberg bill Obama and the Congress rammed through? You know what that means: &#8220;Social justice.&#8221; Which is Latin for: You, successful White guy, will be taxed to pay for Internet access for the losers   &mdash;   many black, but also of all other colors, as a blogger above mentioned. Access to the Internet for all   &mdash;   at our expense. </p>

		<p>  I live in one of the rural areas where there is no broadband and only limited satellite service, much slower than advertised and limited useage means a 5 minute video clip or a program update is ALL the internet for the day.<br>
  Most people around me do not have any internet connection because everything considered $115 monthly for service/programs/equipment and taxes is too much.<br>
In the nearest city unemployment has been over 25% for the last 16 months.<br>
  Most young blacks around this area cannot read well and do not speak using correct grammar so they cannot get a job if they must type because they are not understood. Many have refused to study and their parents who can read and spell well enough for most jobs are disgusted. With the high unemployment I doubt that applications that cannot be read will even get a first interview.<br>
   So is the free broadband internet the new liberal/socialist/communist replacement for &#8220;if they had been surrounded by books as children they would all be geniuses&#8221;?</p>

		<p>If a White man had written this article, he would be classified a Racist, and not inappropriately. Blacks were leaders in acquiring cell phones, because it is a technology that cost effectively meets their needs. The internet is of much less use: Blacks would rather talk or text to someone they know, than use the internet to communicate with strangers. I think that they are spending their often limited incomes effectively.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not fair that some people have broadband while other people are forced to use dial-up. That&rsquo;s unequal! Good thing President Hopenchange is gonna fix that right up. Can you imagine that some people only have what they can pay for? I know, that&rsquo;s awful! Why can&rsquo;t everyone have everything that everyone else has? It&rsquo;s a good thing that those terrible days of getting what you payed for are in the past. Now we can all have what someone else has payed for. Think of all the jobs that will create!</p>

		<p>Broadband to the inner cities will certainly be good for the porn industry.  I&rsquo;m skeptical that the literate parts of the internet will be much influenced.  For myself when I want to learn something serious and requiring real intellectual effort I have to turn the damn computer off and read a book.<br>

		<p>This will only further disincentivize these anointed &#8220;entitled&#8221; ones from taking jobs away from home.  Why work when some chump is paying for you to have cable and internet service?  Along with that USDA credit card for your food, your healthcare is now taken care of, and Obama has a stash if you can&rsquo;t pay your mortgage.  Not yet covered is a free car and auto insurance.  But I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s on Obama&rsquo;s front burner, along with a free college education and a government job with a pension.</p>
<p>What seems upside down in this Bizarro World is that welfare recipients have a right to the fruits of someone else&rsquo;s work.  The fair thing would seem to be that if you are on welfare, to encourage you to get off your butt and support yourself, the only thing available on your cable TV should be infomercials.</p>
<p>This all sounds like a brave new world for the &#8220;entitled&#8221; class, but as Margaret Thatcher so astutely surmised, &#8220;sooner or later you run out of other people&rsquo;s money&#8221;.  Rewarding need will ony make &#8220;need&#8221; grow exponentially while the ability to earn will exponentially diminish if it is taken away to feed someone else&rsquo;s &#8220;need&#8221;.</p>
<p>Greece is heading toward anarchy because taxes no longer fund needs.  With our socialist in chief redistributing all the wealth anyone can earn, we aren&rsquo;t far behind. Ayn Rand had it right.</p>

		<p>So let me get this straight.  The big bad broadband companies are sneakily providing Internet access to the poor blacks in order to make victims of them economically, is that right?  Wow.  Does this guy sit up all night cooking up his next scheme to create more paranoia in the black ghettos than is already there - as if they needed more???</p>

		<p>I am sure Prez. Obama would like to give his Homies another goody, but perhaps a more important and sinister motive is to help gain control of Internet content. Internet sites are the most powerful means of communication ever to exist. This makes it a great threat to the Liberals, and in all Liberal countries but the U.S., governments have control over internet content. I can think of no FedGov assistance program that did not result in substantial FedGov control, e.g. schools, highways, welfrare. Is the internet next?</p>

		<p>Why do poor black job seekers need hi-speed internet? Dial-up works just fine for text heavy job sites. Hi-speed is primarily for watching videos, movies, graphics heavy sites etc&hellip; or for people that need a hi-speed connection for work (and in the unlikely case of these poor urban folks get jobs requiring a fast home connection their companies will pay for satellite).</p>

		<p>So the goverment wants universal internet access? Great, except for how it will be paid for, and the fact while they may want everyone on the &#8216;net, they don&rsquo;t want you to be able to freely exchange ideas. Persons in the giverment (to use Lum and Abner&rsquo;s term) would love to censor anything critical of them or the global socialists. So what it&rsquo;ll come down to is universal access to such exciting sites as Facebook and MySpace. (yawn)  And porn.  Lots of porn.</p>

<p>I think you hit the nail on the head.  No one gets anything for free from the Federal Government.  Much like Mafia &#8220;favors&#8221; or &#8220;favors&#8221; in jail, one ends up having to repay such favors tenfold.    While many focus on the redistributionist (not sure if that&rsquo;s a word) aspect of the policy, it would be much to better to view it through the lens of successful tax-payer providing a newly regulated internet to the hood. Basically, more myspace, facebook, and porn for them, but no Amren or Vdare for you. </p>

		<p>I remember a few years ago when the One Laptop per Child&#8221; project was in its infancy and journalists cooed about the economic takeoff that would result from all the earnest young scholars getting their own cheap laptops and internet access, if only everyone would pitch in and lower the price of a laptop to a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Well, the one-hundred-dollar laptop has been a reality for a couple of years now, but strangely no one talks about the One Laptop per Child project anymore.  No great economic activity has been produced in Africa, at least that I&rsquo;m aware of, other than email offers to split a deposed minister&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>Also, this Mr. Halford seems to be reasoning that since blacks choose not to pay for internet access, a beneficial activity, we should be giving them discounts to encourage consumption.  I wonder what he has to say about the possible price increase of menthol cigarettes by the FDA (https://tinyurl.com/yh4u5xe).  Something tells me he and the majority of other blacks won&rsquo;t be so favorable even though it would be the logical equivalent of Halford&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>One of the very first thing that many African children did when they got their OLPC laptops (especially the boys) was to look at porn.  Future OLPC laptops distributed had a porn filter.  In the meantime, it was really one lapdance per child.</p>
<p>A lot of liberals and do-gooders were opposed to the OLPC project, not because they didn&rsquo;t want black children to have laptops, but because there are 50 million other problems in African more fundamental than the lack of laptops.</p>

<p>Roger that! WR the elder. A super place to find old school books with REAL, ACCURATE information in them is ANTIQUES stores&hellip;there are often hundreds of old school books on the shelves of the small displays in those shops and most of the information is totally unknown in modern texts but accurate.

		<p>This is part of the idea that Internet Access should be a RIGHT. </p>
<p>Obama is moving steadily to ensure that blacks have two options: 1). a government job, or 2). a welfare life with all the trimmings: housing, health care, food stamps and high speed internet access.</p>
<p>Non-Whites are going to bankrupt this country. We probably could afford to subsidize the blacks, but once all these welfare benefits are in place and flowing toward the massive numbers of hispanics then it will be impossible to fund.</p>
