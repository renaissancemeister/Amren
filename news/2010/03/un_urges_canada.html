			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Daly, CTV Montreal, March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Montreal is one of several cities where ethnic Canadians are facing rampant discrimination in policing, education and labour, says a wide-ranging report issued by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The document follows a visit to Montreal and other Canadian cities by Gay McDougall, the UN&rsquo;s Independent Expert on minority issues.</p>
<p>Among the communities she visited last October was Montreal North, which was still tense more than a year after the police shooting death of teenager Fredy Villanueva that triggered widespread riots.</p>
<p>She said many people expressed concerns about Quebec&rsquo;s system of police investigating each other when civilians are hurt or killed during police operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Montreal North residents claim that investigations of police misconduct have not been independent,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Community members told the UN envoy that they want an independent civilian body to probe any allegations of police misconduct. McDougall agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is essential &hellip; that mechanisms of civilian oversight are strengthened where they exist or established where they do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Profiling</p>
<p>McDougall&rsquo;s report also raised concerns about racial profiling, echoing observations in a report issued earlier this week by the Quebec Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>The UN report heard from people who described racial profiling as systemic.</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>Montreal police had a chance to defend their practices during a meeting with the envoy.</p>
<p>Her report said police provided information on their zero-tolerance policy towards racial profiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;They pointed to specialist expert committees established with advisory roles, including on racial profiling and with respect to specific communities,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;They rejected claims of excessive force and impunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>A civilian police ethics commissioner and outside police forces oversee officer conduct across the province.</p>
<p>But McDougall wrote that &#8220;police representatives acknowledged that the process currently fails to have the confidence of the community,&#8221; adding that government officials are trying to improve the system.</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>McDougall also visited Toronto and Vancouver, where she noted similar concerns by ethnic communities. She issued a number of recommendations:</p>
<p>•	Cracking down on racial profiling in all areas of society: </p>
<p>•	Ensuring that ethnic groups have access to jobs while penalizing employers that practice racial discrimination: </p>
<p>•	Making sure that provinces enforce existing employment equity laws: </p>
<p>•	Ensuring that governments recruit, retain and promote minorities to senior posts: </p>
<p>•	Gathering more detailed demographic data on Canadians to get a better picture of ethnic communities: </p>
<p>•	Increasing political participation of minorities </p>
<p>•	Ensuring that anti-terrorism measures don&rsquo;t violate human rights </p>
<p>•	Granting better access to legal aid and human rights agencies.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cracking down on racial profiling in all areas of society&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny. 6 of the 7 remaining recommendations do But profile &#8216;visible minorities&rsquo;. As long as liberals do it, and it&rsquo;s done for the Benefit of non-whites, &#8216;profiling&rsquo; is A-OK and a requirement. All that&rsquo;s left is the jockeying for position as to who is helping non-whites the most and in the most sensitive and correct way. Or hating, disparaging and discriminating against whites the most, depending on how you want to look at it. </p>

		<p>This &#8220;expert&#8221; has proposed a list of recommendations that are proven to be unworkable. They cannot be followed in any consistent way without leading to further conflict and hypocrisy. Some examples. A body that probes allegations of police misconduct will be flooded with spurious complaints by hot-heads and cranks. A zero tolerance policy against profiling will handicap policing in high crime districts. The experience of other regions is that once you get away from a binary black-white situation toward many large groups, affirmative action becomes a tangled mess of claims. I could go on, but Canada is insane for going down the same road that the US has gone.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange that the UN never chides Indonesia and other countries who have tremendous ethnic problems to try to put a lid on them?</p>
<p>The UN is a useless organization and they could well be on the way out in the next few years.  They won&rsquo;t survive any kind of cracking of the American Empire, since they&rsquo;re located in New York.  In fact, they&rsquo;ll be one of the first targets, according to the experts.</p>

		<p>So, we had an <i>unelected</i> U.N. busybody in the name of Gay McDougall who entered our sovereign country on official business, who then proceeded to chastised us over unproven allegations on the strength of a few anecdotal comments from some aggrieved parties, and we&rsquo;re expected to give credence to her claims? </p>
<p>Not likely!</p>
<p>We have our own ELECTED officials that manage our own internal squabbles without the need of some foreign and self-appointed &#8220;<i>independent expert on minority issues</i>&#8221; interfering with our national affairs. </p>

		<p>When I think of who practices discrimination, I think of non-whites. Only Muslims may enter the Arabian city of Mecca. Japan and China are determined not to be overrun by &#8216;ethnic others&rsquo;. In Canada, aboriginals demanded and practice rights forbidden to whites, such as unrestricted fishing and the power to throw non-whites out of their racially pure aboriginal communities. The United States has done all it can do to boost blacks via affirmative action and civil rights (not that it accomplished much), while in Africa, blacks routinely rob and murder whites. If the United Nations was serious about tackling discrimination, it&rsquo;d be focusing on non-whites as the perpetrators. That&rsquo;s the simple truth of the matter.</p>

		<p>While Quebecers seem to have more backbone than their fellow Canadians in the English speaking provinces, Canada has been committing national suicide at a pace rivaled only by Great Britain. I&rsquo;d guess Montreal, Quebec Province and the national government in Ottawa will slavishly fall all over each other in rushing to adopt the UN &#8220;standards.&#8221; Canada was a 90% white, civilized society with a rugged independence to match its breath-taking scenery until Trudeau and/or Expo 67. Since then, it has rushed to be come an egalitarian socialist republic where recent immigrants, arriving under the most liberal immigration policies in the Western Hemisphere, have more rights than those born north of the 49th. Diefenbacher&rsquo;s Canada would have told the UN to go to hell; Harper&rsquo;s Canada will fall in line. What a pity.</p>

I know you&rsquo;re getting paid 50 times per year more than I, but seriously, I do perform a service to my local community without complaint (I&rsquo;m a delivery man),so why don&rsquo;t you learn how to cook or get a job sweeping roads or something&hellip;you just might be a little bit happier &#8216;scaling down&rsquo;, as they say.<br>
You also might get a good night&rsquo;s sleep for a change if you ceased to worry about all those horrible white oppressors (with a name like McDougall I know it could be hard; you are white after all&hellip;)but give it a go.<br>
Best wishes for a mentally healthy career chage love, but to be honest&hellip;I&rsquo;m not optimistic.  </p>

		<p>There is a very easy way to deal with such agitators: Just say no! In other words, whenever they cry racial discrimination or oppression, we just have to tell them that we&rsquo;re not going to indulge them. If we COMPLETELY ignore them long enough, they&rsquo;ll get the message. However, as long as there are some whites (particularly if they&rsquo;re elites) who listen to their complaints, then they&rsquo;ll be forever emboldened. So far, non-white agitators have been given a large dose of positive and negative reinforcement from too many whites. We need to just stop giving in to them. Every time we show weakness, we only further motivate our enemies. </p>
<p>I also agree with other posters here. Why doesn&rsquo;t the UN ever chastise China or Japan for discriminating against their fellow Asians? Why doesn&rsquo;t Malaysia face similar scrutiny. Oh, that&rsquo;s right, only we benighted and ignorant whites can be racist. </p>
<p>The UN is a useless organization. They can&rsquo;t help the people of Darfur, Zimbabwe, or other 3rd world areas, yet we&rsquo;re expected to take them seriously when an &#8220;expert&#8221; on racism (translation: find a way to blame whites) chastises us? Give me a break!</p>

		<p>If you read the word &#8220;Nations&#8221; in the noun &#8220;United Nations&#8221;, by it&rsquo;s precise meaning &#8220;Ethnicity/Race&#8221;, then its purpose becomes much clearer. </p>
<p>As I conceive it and as is likely obvious to all in attendance here, the United Nations was never meant to function as a collection of the worlds Sovereign States, brought together to settle international disputes; the United Nations is an engine designed for &#8220;Uniting&#8221; (Merging) the &#8220;Nation&rsquo;s&#8221; (Ethnicities) of the world at Western expense and bringing about World Government. </p>
<p>The goal of the elite is a Global Government that governs over a world without a white middle class: people with a genetic inheritance capable of ending their tyranny. They want a populace so incapable, that as Bertrand Russell puts it &#8220;A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve put your finger on it!  Just relocate the UN to someplace like the United Arab Emirates or Singapore and the whole focus would shift!  And even if they didn&rsquo;t relent on Western immigration issues, their motives would be much easier to descern or at least identify by more people.<br>

<p>The U.N. building isn&rsquo;t just IN the U.S. the amount of financial support we White TAXPAYING SLAVES provide is staggering. Remember our support of the &#8220;emerging African nations&#8221; we send billions to one country, it breaks into 3 countries, we send billions to 3 countries now instead of 1 and support 3 ruthless African &#8220;heads of state&#8221; instead of 1. Same thing when we promptly recognized Bangledesh and Pakistanin separatist movements and look how much trouble that has gotten us. There is also the matter of voting in the U.N. those 3 &#8220;emerging African nations&#8221; now have a vote in how the U.N. money is spent (OUR MONEY) and those votes are equal in weight to the vote the U.S. has.</p>

<p>Well, the Villanueva thing, again!</p>
<p>I live in the Canadian province of Québec, In Canada, and Montréal is our largest city. </p>
<p>I think we ought to get something straight, here: Freddy Villanueva and his older brother did about everything they could do to make their encounter with two Montreal police officers, becom violent.</p>
<p>The older Villanueva brother, who was just out of prison on the Quebecker equivalent of parole, &#8220;liberté conditionelle&#8221;, was set free on the promise of having no contact with his gang buddies, and restraining from gambling.</p>
<p>But he became suspected of having played a part in another recent crime, so policemen were sent to interrogate him. They actually caught him gambling on a sidewalk, palying dice, with men who were well know street gang members, in that neighbourhood&hellip;</p>
<p>The two young police officers told Freddy&rsquo;s brother that he had to come to the police station with them, but he resisted his arrest. A brawl quickly followed, in which his friends and younger brother Freddy got into. One of the officers drew his service pistol, and in the mêlée, 19-year old Frederico Villanueva was shot in the chest!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad, but it&rsquo;s not like the Villanueva brothers were innocent boys, who were just at the wrong place and the wrong time! I mean, what should one expect, if they resort to pushing and kicking around policemen, while resisting arrest?<br>
