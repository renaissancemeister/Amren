<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100313/US.Native.Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian Government May Become Reality</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Niesse, Comcast News, March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Native Hawaiians are the last remaining indigenous group in the United States that hasn&rsquo;t been allowed to establish their own government, a right already extended to Alaska Natives and 564 Native American tribes.</p>
<p>With a final vote pending in the U.S. Senate and Hawaii-born President Barack Obama on their side, the nation&rsquo;s 400,000 Native Hawaiians could earn federal recognition as soon as this month  &mdash;  and the land, money and power that comes with it. They measure passed the U.S. House last month.</p>
<p>Many Native Hawaiians believe this process could help right the wrongs perpetuated since their kingdom was overthrown in 1893. The also point to the hundreds of thousands who died from diseases spread by foreign explorers before the kingdom fell.</p>
<p>Native Hawaiians never fully assimilated after the first Europeans arrived in 1778: They earn less money, live shorter lives, get sent to prison more often and are more likely to end up homeless than other ethnicities, said Clyde Namuo, CEO of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the state-funded agency founded to improve the conditions of Native Hawaiians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, just what Native Hawaiians would receive if the federal recognition measure passes Congress is uncertain. The bill sets up negotiations between a new Native Hawaiian government, the state of Hawaii and the federal government, but it doesn&rsquo;t specify what resources Native Hawaiians would receive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation say it would give Native Hawaiians special treatment at the expense of other taxpayers. One study commissioned by a group opposed to a Native Hawaiian government predicted it would cost $343 million a year in lost tax revenue if 25 percent of the state&rsquo;s lands were transferred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the role of government to try and make up for past wrongs,&#8221; said Jamie Story, president of the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, which promotes free markets and small government.</p>
<p>Supporters view the proposal as a way to provide reconciliation to the Hawaiian people that was urged in the 1993 Apology Resolution, in which Congress acknowledged the United States&rsquo; role in the Hawaiian Kingdom&rsquo;s overthrow 100 years earlier.</p>
<p>They hope Native Hawaiians could eventually get greater access to affordable housing, their own culturally focused education system, health centers and full-time jobs that would include teaching hula or Hawaiian language if the bill passes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The amount of money and land at stake could be substantial.</p>
<p>About $338 million is held in trust for Native Hawaiians by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. In addition, University of Hawaii law professor Jon Van Dyke, who wrote &#8220;Who Owns the Crown Lands of Hawaii?&#8221;, said a Hawaiian government should receive about 1 million acres  &mdash;  about 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s land mass that was once monarchy property.</p>
<p>How the trust money and land would be used is a big question, said Kaulana Park, chairman of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, which provides housing to Native Hawaiians on former kingdom lands.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A majority of Native Hawaiians favor this process of federal recognition, Namuo said. But it is opposed by pro-independence groups who want the Hawaiian kingdom restored.</p>
<p>About 109,000 Native Hawaiians have registered for Kau Inoa, a signature drive run by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to establish a list of voters who would be eligible for elections associated with a Native Hawaiian government entity.</p>
<p>A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, said the legislation could reach the Senate floor this month, but because of other national priorities, Akaka&rsquo;s goal is to get the vote by August.</p>

		<p>I say give it to them.  An encourage all native peoples to go there.  Guam  has become a much more strategic location and the military is already building its port facilities and infrastructure.  Its indigenous population is small and the island has the same tropical attraction.<br>

		<p>Hawaii should never have become the fiftieth state in the first place.</p>
<p>Those Polynesian islands are detached from North America by two thousand miles or more and it&rsquo;s people as alien to the Euro-Ameican experience as you can get.</p>
<p>I say good riddence to this dead weight. Let indulgent whites find another place to vacation. If they want to live there, let them expatriate.</p>

		<p>I say give &#8216;em their independence - we don&rsquo;t need their dumb islands as a state.  Besides, the native Hawaiian kids have long set a precedent of beating up any white kids (houles) who go to their schools, which shows they don&rsquo;t like us right from the gitgo.  Let &#8216;em take it back - and all their indebtedness, too.</p>

		<p>One could argue that taking 20% or more of a given area and setting it aside for only one race, where they will have their own schools, own police, own courts, own government, is segregation.  Apparently that term is only bad for some people.</p>

		<p>Giving up Hawaii is simply giving it to Japan or China, they both have large colonies there.  Give the big island to the natives if we must, kick everyone else out, and the rest belongs to the Navy.  <br>
     Question: How long before the natives are starving?</p>

		<p>Yes, give them independence.  Tourists can still go there for a vacation.  The white population is small.  Guam can be a better military base, and after independence, the Asians who make up 50% of the island will overthrow the native monarchy.</p>

		<p>Maybe they go to prison more often because they commit more crimes. Hawaiians have historically had a problem with the concept of private property and theft is rampant in the islands. In fact, the English naval hero and explorer James Cook was killed in Hawaii on his second visit after confronting the natives over stolen British property. Whites are treated with contempt in Hawaii and will always be considered outsiders and pale faces (haoles). I say give them their own government and then cut them loose as a state.</p>

<p>Well, this is correct. The new gov of the &#8220;indigenous&#8221; population will be authoritarian tending toward dictatorship and abusive of any dissent. </p>
<p>&#8220;They earn less money, live shorter lives,&#8221;</p>
<p>As with regard to the health, as Michael Savage would say:</p>
<p>&#8220;anytime you go into a Mc Donalds and eat at one sitting a dozen Big Macs, half a dozen orders of fries and three milk shakes, guess what, you are going to have a health problem!&#8221;<br>

		<p>To the person who claimed that Kaulana Park was a Korean. He is a representative of many Native Hawaiians who are a mixture of both White and Asian races. There are very few pure Hawaiians left in Hawaii. The majority of them live on the private island of Niihau, that is owned by the Robinson family.</p>

		<p>Since they think of whites as pale faced devils without a soul, then we should let them have their islands back, after we demolish everything we built there. Give them what they want, only not the way they want it. Inside of a year, they will be starving to death and would be eating crow for it too. Then we&rsquo;ll leave them to the tender mercies of Red China when they inevitably expand into the Pacific. </p>
