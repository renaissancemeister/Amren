			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sophie Freeman, Daily Mail (London), March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party was today barred from taking new members after its amended rules of application were deemed to be still racist.</p>
<p>Judge Paul Collins declared the far right group&rsquo;s membership rules illegal, and said the party was &#8220;likely to commit unlawful acts of discrimination within the Race Relations Act&#8221;.</p>
<p>The BNP had agreed to remove its whites-only policy following a legal challenge by the government&rsquo;s Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).</p>
<p>The party had previously stipulated that only &#8220;indigenous caucasians&#8221; and people from ethnic groups &#8220;emanating from that race&#8221; could join.</p>
<p>But it scrapped that clause  &mdash;  after months of delay  &mdash;  at an extraordinary general meeting in February.</p>
<p>However, the EHRC decided to challenge the new rules, claiming that they still amounted to indirect racism.</p>
<p>Sitting at Central London County Court, Judge Collins issued an injunction ordering the group to comply with race equality laws.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The membership list will have to be closed until then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hearing had been told that, under the new rules, applicants would be subject to a two-hour home visit by BNP officials.</p>
<p>Robin Allen QC, representing the EHRC, said that could operate as a form of indirect discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;One way the provisions could operate would be to intimidate someone who wanted to join the party,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Speaking after the judgment, BNP leader Nick Griffin said the decision had &#8220;opened a very dangerous door&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a huge change to the unwritten constitution of Britain,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are claiming that they have been granted the right to interfere in what a party believes but the only people who have the right to judge are the electorate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the ruling was &#8220;more than symbolic&#8221;, adding: &#8220;It has given an organ of the state the power to interfere in the aims and objectives of any political party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin, who had been met with angry scenes as he arrived at court  &mdash;  including a group of protesters who chanted &#8220;Nazi scum&#8221;  &mdash;  said there were about 7,000 people on the waiting list to join the party, including &#8220;a number of ethnic minorities&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is only a couple of each,&#8221; he said, adding that there were two Chinese people on the list, several Sikhs and several West Indians.</p>
<p>He said that if the party was forced to pay £60,000 in costs it would have &#8220;some effect&#8221; on the general election campaign &#8220;but not a huge amount&#8221;.</p>
<p>Judge Collins ruled: &#8220;I hold that the BNP are likely to commit unlawful acts of discrimination within section 1b Race Relations Act 1976 in the terms on which they are prepared to admit persons to membership under the 12th addition of their constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judgment found that, while it is not unlawful to hold discriminatory views, it is unlawful for such principles to be used for controlled entry to a political party, the EHRC said.</p>
<p>Susie Uppal, director of legal enforcement at the commission, said after the judgment: &#8220;The commission is glad that today&rsquo;s judgment confirms our view that both the BNP&rsquo;s 11th constitution and the amended 12th constitution are unlawful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political parties, like any other organisation, are obliged to respect the law and not discriminate against people who wish to become members.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BNP will now have to take the necessary steps to ensure that it complies with the Race Relations Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;This matter could have been resolved last year by the BNP changing its constitution properly, rather than believing that it could find a way round discrimination laws so that it appeared to be open to members regardless of their ethnicity, while in practice continuing to prevent them from joining.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision to change the BNP constitution came after the far-right party held an extraordinary general meeting in Essex on February 14.</p>
<p>Following the change in the constitution last month, millionaire Asian businessman Mo Chaudry said he would apply to join the party to &#8220;fight them from the inside&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he was told his application would be blocked.</p>
<p>Mr Chaudry, 49, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, said earlier: &#8220;They have no real intention of allowing people like me into the fold. It is just a camouflage to appease the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti-BNP campaign group Searchlight described today&rsquo;s judgment as a &#8220;devastating personal humiliation&#8221; for Mr Griffin.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;His desperate attempt to give the BNP a veneer of respectability in time for the general election has been torn to shreds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BNP has been proven in court to be as racist and extremist as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weyman Bennett, general secretary of Unite Against Fascism, added: &#8220;The cosmetic changes that Nick Griffin tried to make were exposed as not being honest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe the BNP wants to pervert our democracy in order to introduce racist policies into the mainstream.&#8221;<br>

<p>They prefer the direct kind and out in the open and put into writing when necessary, as long as it is against whites. </p>
<p>&#8216;Section 1b of the race relations act of 1976&hellip;&rsquo; I guess supplanting an entire race of people isn&rsquo;t racism, but objecting to positive-action, is?  </p>

		<p>Its now holding a &#8216;discriminatory view&rsquo; to object to affirmative action, discrimination itself, and to object to whites being discriminated against off their entire island. I suppose we should be grateful it isn&rsquo;t labeled &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>But if you check the BNP website. They are accepting members now.  So this newspaper is telling bare-faced lies? Well, I guess that&rsquo;s not so surprising.  <br>
Also, whoever came up with the notion of &#8220;indirect discrimination&#8221; should.. well, something extremely unpleasant should happen to that person. that&rsquo;s all.</p>

		<p>Maybe the BNP should approach this problem from the reverse and get clarity about what ethnic rights the British people have. Does the government recognize an English, Scottish, or Welsh identity? Does the government support efforts to nourish these identities? Does the government understand that these traditional ethnic identities need to be supported now that the homelands are being changed by diversity and multiculturalism? </p>

<p>The newspaper just chose to fail to disclose whatever it is that is so bad about the BNPs practices. It must be pretty light, or something with which the public might have mixed feelings, to simply not reveal at all what is the BNP is doing that is so &#8216;hateful&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of very &#8216;soft&rsquo; propaganda? The public is supposed to object to the BNP with very little or absolutely no reason given? Imagine if the BNP gave them reason?</p>

		<p>While I hate the fact that the BNP(specifically, Nick Griffin himself) had to sidestep the EHRC and change Section 4(the &#8220;you must agree with our party&rsquo;s principles to join&#8221; section, not the &#8220;we stand up for white people&rsquo;s interests&#8221; section, which is section 33) of the party&rsquo;s constitution to avoid more costly legal issues before the election, it is almost worth it when I think about the reaction of the white hating racist&rsquo;s at the EHRC when they found out that he was able to completely ignore them despite the anti-white court&rsquo;s ruling in their favor.</p>

		<p>The Campaign to preserve the White English ethnic group has been created to campaign for a separate tick box for White ethnic English identity in the 2011 Census of England, and to raise £100,000 to seek a Judicial Review of the Government&rsquo;s action in treating the White English less favourably than (for example) &#8216;White Irish&rsquo; and &#8216;White Gypsy or Irish travellers&rsquo; each of which have separate tick boxes. The background to our campaign is the fact that HM Government has arranged for the 2011 Census in Scotland to include provision for the majority ethnic group of &lsquo;White Scottish&rsquo; to be recorded separately. However, whilst separate provision has been made for &lsquo;White Irish&rsquo; and &#8216;White Gypsy or Irish Traveller&rsquo; to record their ethnic group separately in England, there is no separate provision for &lsquo;White English&rsquo; (the largest single racial group in the British Isles) to record their ethnic identity. Moreover, there is no commitment to publish in the ONS 2011 Census outputs the numbers of those recording their ethnic identity as &lsquo;English&rsquo; in the &lsquo;White Other&rsquo; group.  In December 2008, the current arrangements were placed before Parliament in a White Paper presented by a Cabinet Minister who had previously broadcast pride in his Irish ethnicity and endorsed by a British government headed by a Scottish Prime Minister and a Scottish Chancellor of the Exchequer. The result is racial discrimination on a national scale. This conduct is no less dishonest than but consistent with the present corrupt Parliament&rsquo;s attitude to expenses.  Given that the stated purpose of collecting such information is to &ldquo;enable national and local government and health authorities to allocate resources and plan programmes&rdquo;, it may be concluded that no particular account (if any) will be taken of the special needs of ethnic English group in England. Moreover, the English racial group will be disadvantaged in seeking to establish their statutory rights not to be discriminated against.  Continued refusal to rectify the situation by providing the ethnic English with a tick-box in the 2011 census form will constitute further proof of HM Government&rsquo;s undeclared policy of destroying England as a national entity whilst denying recognition of the English as a discrete racial group in their own land. </p>

		<p>Basically, if you ignore all the extraneous fluff surrounding this story it really is a tale of the executive and judicial arms of the state acting in concert to destroy a basic human right (supposedly enshrined in various extra national UN and European covenants), namely the right of individuals to freedom of political belief.<br>
 - No &#8216;ifs&rsquo; no &#8216;buts&rsquo; about it - that&rsquo;s all the story boils down to, the right of individuals to hold political opinions in the form where they can only actually matter (ie as a Party or Organisation), free from the interference of a state which wishes to suppress political dissent.<br>
 Apparently this principle is not recognised by the British courts.<br>
 Amnesty International, for example, regularly gets into a tizzy about &#8216;sexy&rsquo; violent left-wing revolutionaries in Latin America on the grounds that they are &#8216;prisoners of conscience&rsquo; - many of these people are involved in acts of terror and violence, something the BNP has never done.<br>
 Will amnesty International fight the BNP&rsquo;s corner? - you know the answer.<br>
Will the Council of Europe or the European Court of Human Rights defend the BNP?, will the UN censure the British state?</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s illegal to make public anything which could be construed as holding a &#8216;discriminatory view&rsquo; if one is English, White and Christian. But this does not apply if a person is none of these and especially if evading charges of fraud. This may seem  unbelievable, but it does indeed apply in certain circumstances where the &#8216;rules&rsquo; are vague. Meanwhile the White guys are arrested and will be prosecuted for exactly the same offense but this will not be considered as &#8216;discriminatory&rsquo; in any way whatsoever even though this has all been made very public indeed.<br>

		<p>This must be from an early edition. Originally, the ruling stated that the BNP couldn&rsquo;t require new members to agree to oppose mass immigration, on the grounds that this effectively barred minorities (go figure). Griffin, having been granted the authority to change membership rules on the fly, rescinded that condition, and now they are compliant and accepting new members again. You can find more comprehensive coverage from the usual news sources.</p>

		<p>Whoever wrote this article was misinformed.  The BNP is taking on new members now and they have a huge backlog of people wanted to join.  This temporary membership ban has actually helped the BNP.  Nobody likes a bully.  The MSM press has tried to portray the BNP as Nazi thugs but MSM has been caught in a lie and now the British people have decided who is telling the truth about political correctness and multi-culturism and it is not the media.</p>
<p>Go to BNP.org&hellip;&hellip;and find out for yourself what is happening in Britain.  The BNP appears to be growing phenomenally and appears to be on track to win several MP slots this General Election. </p>
<p>The effort to portray the BNP as the bad guys has failed and now the BNP is gaining many converts.  Good for them.</p>
<p>The MSM has lost an incredible amount of credibility in their campaign to disinform the British public.  </p>

		<p>Just to clarify something very basic&hellip;&#8221;The BNP had agreed to remove its whites-only policy following a legal challenge by the government&rsquo;s Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)&#8221;&hellip;. but the misnamed EHRC is not interested in equalities when it involves the White English race. They also hold the view that Human Rights do not apply to the White English race but only to non-Whites. Note that this commission is an arm of our scottish communist government and is entirely made up a collection of non-Whites and was set up specifically to harass the BNP using taxpayer funds to do so. It is in no way independent and is a non-elected body which operates unchallenged by the electorate. There is no way the BNP can criticise any member of the EHRC without being called racist. There is a saying here in England.. the difference between the EHRC and a rottweiler is that the rottweiler will eventually get tired and let go.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Race Relations Act&#8221; - the &#8216;law&rsquo; which none of the British people voted for. We were never asked. Therefore this &#8216;law&rsquo; is the law of tyranny, nothing else.</p>
