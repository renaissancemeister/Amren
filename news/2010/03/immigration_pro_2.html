			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Allen, The Hill, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Hispanic lawmakers on Thursday will tell President Barack Obama that they may not vote for healthcare reform unless changes are made to the bill&rsquo;s immigration provisions.</p>
<p>The scheduled meeting comes as Democratic leaders and the White House are struggling to craft a final bill that will attract 216 votes in the lower chamber.</p>
<p>Unlike abortion, immigration has flown beneath the radar, and almost seemed to vanish altogether as House Democrats have wrestled with how to accept a Senate healthcare bill far different from the one they passed in November.</p>
<p>But immigration remains just as explosive an issue and carries the same potential to derail the entire healthcare endgame, a number of Democrats said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since last fall, Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) members have kept quiet, at least publicly, about their objections to the immigration provisions in the Senate bill.</p>
<p>The Senate language would prohibit illegal immigrants&rsquo; buying healthcare coverage from the proposed health exchanges. The House-passed bill isn&rsquo;t as restrictive, but it does  &mdash;  like the Senate bill  &mdash;  bar illegal immigrants from receiving federal subsidies to buy health insurance.</p>
<p>Hispanic Democrats say they haven&rsquo;t moved from their stance that they will not vote for a healthcare bill containing the Senate&rsquo;s prohibitions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, members of the CHC privately acknowledged they&rsquo;ve told their leaders that anyone who is assuming they&rsquo;ve backed away from their position is in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [Hispanic] Caucus didn&rsquo;t want to raise it as an issue too early,&#8221; one Hispanic Democrat said Wednesday. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s real. It&rsquo;s a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, it is unlikely that the Senate will be able to change the immigration provisions under reconciliation rules. And even if it is deemed possible, there may not be enough support in either chamber of Congress to do it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But one member of the Hispanic Caucus said that, when the issue was raised in November, Cuellar was the only Hispanic Democrat who vowed not to bring down the House healthcare bill over the Senate&rsquo;s tougher treatment of undocumented workers.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Cuellar said he doubted he would be alone if it happens again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If [the Senate language] comes up for a vote over here, I think there will be other folks who&rsquo;ll be with me in not voting no over that language,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you going to stop the whole thing because of this provision here? I almost hate to say this, but it&rsquo;s a cost-benefit analysis, a big-picture view.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One Hispanic House Democrat described Thursday&rsquo;s meeting with Obama as &#8220;critical to him fully understanding our thinking, our understanding his, and all of us figuring out how we go forward on both this healthcare bill and immigration reform as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a similar meeting at the White House in early November, which occurred just days before the House voted on its healthcare bill, the CHC failed to convince Obama to reject the Senate immigration language.</p>
<p>The result was a bloc of solid Democratic votes that remained up in the air until a deal was reached at the last minute to address the gap between the House and the Senate immigration restrictions during &#8220;conference negotiations.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think this is all a rope-a-dope trick by Hispanic politicians and the Obama White House to trick moderate whites into voting for HCR, based on the premise that it doesn&rsquo;t give ObamaCare to illegals.  The dirty little secret is that it will, because (1) There is no enforcement mechanism, (2) Even if there was, illegals can get fake IDs, and (3) Even if they couldn&rsquo;t get fake IDs, the Federal bureaucrats would either be white liberals, or Hispanic in states that are illegal-heavy, and would sign the illegals up anyway.</p>

		<p>Why do Latino politicians want millions more Mexicans in this country?  I&rsquo;m sure race has nothing to do with it.  After all, only white people can be racists.  </p>

		<p>We see clear signs that the fracture of American political parties, and the social fabric-is IMMINENT. <br>
GOOD!<br>
Hispanics in the US Fed have the gaul (befitting true Hispanics) to demand that LAWBREAKERS AND CRIMINALS OF FOREIGN ORIGIN, recieve federal benefits, paid by American natives.<br>
They threaten (again, like real Hispanics do so well) that it&rsquo;s their way, or hell to pay.<br>
GOOD!<br>
The day is at hand. Though I never wanted it, the neocons, the marxists, and their ignorant, squalling pawns (the Hispanics) ar epushing it. The nation will not remain intact for another decade. Hispanics have swamped the population, and will begin to vote in racial blocs. When they take  cue from blacks, and vote on race soley (As in the Obama election), it&rsquo;s all over. In less than a decade, they will strip away parts of the USA.<br>
GOOD. There will ensue, the formation of a white nation.</p>

		<p>Whether or not illegal immigrants can purchase health insurance under this bill is irrelevant.  Under the EMTALA act of 1986, hospitals are still required to provide emergency care to anyone in need regardless of their ability to pay.  This includes illegal immigrants, and believe you me, they take full advantage of it, so I really don&rsquo;t understand why the Hispanic Caucus is getting their panties in a wad over the language in this bill.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know who these hispanic idiots think they are threatening Obama with not supporting the health bill unless they get their fifth columnist amnesty. Seventy five per-cent of the American public wants nothing to do with this bogus health care bill.</p>

		<p>Do these foul parasites ever give up their unjustified demands? Who&rsquo;s country is this? Has Mexico annexed our nation that we take our orders from Hispanic lobbyists and minority Congressional representatives?</p>

		<p>For several reasons this is all irrelevant. These people already have health care, not health insurance perhaps, but certainly health care. Actually they don&rsquo;t even need health insurance, since it is impossible to recover a debt from these freeloaders, who mainly have no assets to grab. The old blood from a turnip axium applies here. Plus in reality how many hispanic congressmen can there be? I doubt enough to affect the vote, but of course they will garner votes from many of their moronic white sympathizers. As we speak no one can legally be refused health care/treatment. It&rsquo;s all about a giant power grab by our democratic facist government. Welcome to the Disunited socialist/communist states of America. <br>

		<p>To #5 and #8:</p>
<p>While illegals may have access to emergency healthcare, that is NOT the same thing as having access to healthcare!</p>
<p>If you wore out your knees working construction, the emergency room might give you a brace and some Tylenol.  It won&rsquo;t do knee surgery to fix the damage.</p>
<p>Imagine all the back surgeries, joint replacements, and organ transplants.  Imagine all the long-term therapies for chronic conditions.</p>
