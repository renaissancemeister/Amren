			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruth Manuel-Logan, Black Voices, March 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years there were whispers that pop sensation Michael Jackson had been dabbling with skin-lightening concoctions. Now the truth has come to light. After Jackson died last June, police investigators began snooping around the superstar&rsquo;s rented digs, and they discovered a virtual pharmacy of drugs.</p>
<p>Mind-numbing sedatives, sleep medications and powerful painkillers were uncovered by authorities at Jackson&rsquo;s L.A. mansion. But what authorities also discovered was a stash of 19 tubes of the skin-bleaching agent hydroquinone and 18 tubes of Benoquin, a skin-whitening cream commonly prescribed to those suffering from extensive vitiligo, a disease that attacks pigmentation.</p>
<p>Since vitiligo creates patches of depigmented skin, the creams found were used to lighten the remaining colored skin in order to achieve a more even-tone appearance.</p>

<p>That sounds like the typical American &ldquo;news&rdquo; program; a near hallucinatory phantasm, of what is both painfully seductive and rapturously destructive. </p>
<p>One might call it, a River Styx Holiday!</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;him,&rdquo; Saint Michael of the 80&rsquo;s and the Sister Michelle that followed straight through 1990s and the century&rsquo;s turn, an old joke suffices. Where else but in the USA, could a poor black boy from Chicago become a rich &ldquo;white woman&rdquo; in LA at the end of &ldquo;his&rdquo; days?</p>
<p>ABC&hellip;1,2,3&hellip;&hellip;it&rsquo;s not a math contest or a spelling bee:</p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t tell me that&rsquo;s a surprise!  Everybody knew for years and years that Michael Jackson was trying to make himself white, and this would include any skin-bleaching creams available.  Too bad he started down such a road before being black became &#8220;in.&#8221;  I bet he lived long enough to totally regret his decision!</p>

		<p>@John PM - Actually, Jacko grew up to be an Asian-American woman, not a white woman. Half Afghan, half Japanese, I think.</p>

		<p>The news story says the lightening creams were used on the darker blotchy patches of skin merely to even them out  so as to match the areas lightened by disease. If so, then why is this a big news story? </p>
<p>On the other hand, one might wonder why Jackson didn&rsquo;t instead use skin <i>darkening</i> creams to restore the areas lightened by the disease&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think it was his WHOLE BODY that what is his name was trying to bleach.</p>
<p>When what is his name was standing trial for the child molestation case, the testimony of the accuser described the private parts of what is his name as being mottled. What is his name said that he had to undergo a very &#8220;humiliating&#8221; physical exam! </p>
<p>What is his name did not only bleach his face, hands, etc., he bleached the whole of him?</p>
<p>What is his name just had ways about him. And NOT good ways either. You make a hard bed, you sleep on it.</p>

		<p>The thing no one seems to be asking is why Michael Jackson had such trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he was a crackhead (or maybe a methhead&hellip;usually it&rsquo;s crack in these cases).</p>
<p>Whenever you see someone with this sort of morbid insomnia (ie not being able to sleep for weeks at a time), it&rsquo;s one of two things&hellip;.a brain tumor or severe abuse of &#8220;speedy&#8221; drugs (ie crack cocain or crystal meth).</p>
<p>This has done in more than one celebrity (curious how &#8220;celebrities&#8221; all seem to be sick, drug fiends&hellip;but that is another issue).  For example, John Belusia and River Phoenix.  These people were &#8220;speed balling&#8221;.  Using central nervous suppresant drugs to counteract the side effects of huge amounts of cocaine.  Michael Jackson adds the wrinkle of graduating to use of actual anesthesia (I can just imagine how much crack he must have been smoking), but it is the same thing.</p>
<p>Jackson died while speed balling.  Curious how no one asks the most basic question&hellip;..if he didn&rsquo;t have a brain tumor, why did he need anesthesia just to get a nights sleep everyone week or so?</p>

		<p>A life long use of expensive creams, medications and drugs, just to change the superficial appearance of a black man into a White man. Nobody knows how much more medication, therapy, surgery etc&hellip; would have been need to truly change him into a White man with White D.N.A, White brains, White instincts etc&hellip; And we are told that a bantu can easily become an Englishman and that there is no difference between the races!</p>

		<p>Having lived in South Africa for 24 years before escaping in 1999, there was a major problem there with especially the black women using skin whitening creams, bought at pharmacies, that often left their faces with big discoloured blotches all over them.  The former (white) government ended up banning the creams as they were costing the State in medical costs for treatment.</p>
<p>It kind of makes a mnockery of the expression that &#8220;Black is beautiful&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>While the Obama administration has levied a ten percent tax on tanning beds, these creams, many of them dangerous to user and toxic to the environment, have been given a pass.  I was always bemused at work by the harangues of one &#8220;PROUD, BLACK WOMAN&#8221; and more than once wanted to reply, &#8220;But why are your neck and elbows so dark?&#8221;  I didn&rsquo;t, though.  A Southerner must remain a gentleman and even the dire realists of Amren are not without vanity.</p>

		<p>Jackson himself said in an interview with Oprah that he used creams to even out the patches on his skin.  I don&rsquo;t know why people &#8220;whisper&#8221; about it.</p>
