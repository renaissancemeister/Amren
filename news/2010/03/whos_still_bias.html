<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you work at a large company, and especially if you manage other people, chances are you&rsquo;ve gone through diversity training. The vast majority of the Fortune 500 and, by some estimates, the majority of American employers offer diversity training programs for their employees. Many make such training mandatory. The amount of money spent on it in the United States runs into the billions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now a few social scientists are taking a hard look at these programs, and, so far, what they&rsquo;re finding is that <a id="training"><b>there&rsquo;s little evidence that diversity training works.</b></a> A paper published last year by the psychologist Elizabeth Levy Paluck of Princeton University&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson School and the Yale University political scientist Donald Green comprehensively surveyed the literature on prejudice reduction measures and found no empirical support for the idea that diversity training programs change attitudes or behavior. Similarly, a 2008 literature review paper by Carol Kulik of the University of South Australia and Loriann Roberson of Columbia University found that, on the question of changing behavior, there were few trustworthy studies  &mdash;  and decidedly mixed results among those. And research by a team of sociologists on more than 800 companies over three decades has found that the best diversity training programs make little difference in who gets hired and promoted, and many programs actually decrease the number of women and minorities in management.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics, on the other hand, argue that today&rsquo;s practitioners are unlikely to be converging on a set of best practices, since the field is characterized by divergent, even contradictory approaches to the same set of problems. To critics, the proponents are simply mistaking the fact that people feel better about themselves after training for real results. Just because people think they&rsquo;re less prejudiced doesn&rsquo;t mean they are. Indeed, with something as subtle and reflexive as bias, we&rsquo;re often our own worst judges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The current popularity of diversity training, however, dates to the 1980s. The social revolutions of the 1960s had brought more minorities and women into the workplace, but their integration was halting, leading to widespread problems: Women and minorities were hired and promoted far less frequently than white males, and paid less for the same work. Many complained of social exclusion, habitual slights, or open hostility from colleagues. These complaints spilled into the public eye as workers began to sue their employers for discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>Managers, faced with predictions of even greater demographic changes in the workplace in coming decades, turned to diversity courses as a way to respond. Some firms adopted the programs to preemptively head off discord and make themselves more appealing to minority applicants and customers. Others, like Texaco and Coca-Cola, were compelled to implement them under the settlement terms of discrimination lawsuits. A whole &#8220;diversity management&#8221; industry arose to meet  &mdash;  and encourage  &mdash;  the need, and large companies began creating diversity task forces and hiring chief diversity officers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several years ago Kalev, along with Dobbin and Erin Kelly of the University of Minnesota, set out to see what works. {snip}</p>
<p>The researchers found that while diversity training was by far the most popular approach, it was also the least effective at getting companies to hire and promote women and minorities. Some training programs were more effective than others: Voluntary programs were better than mandatory ones, and those that focused on the threat of bias and harassment lawsuits were worse than those that did not. But even the better programs led only to marginal changes. And those that were mandatory or discussed lawsuits  &mdash;  the vast majority of the programs the researchers examined  &mdash;  slightly reduced the number of women and minorities in management. Required training and legalistic training both make people resentful, the authors suggest, and likely to rebel against what they&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elizabeth Levy Paluck has taken perhaps the broadest look at the literature. In studies she did alone and with Yale&rsquo;s Green, she looked at 985 published and unpublished reports on prejudice reduction programs, by academics and nonacademics.</p>
<p>Among those studies, Paluck found that the ones on diversity training were among the least rigorous: They often comprised little more than asking participants to fill out surveys on their own attitudes. Several compared the attitudes of training participants to a &#8220;control&#8221; group of co-workers who had opted not to attend the training, but without actually controlling for the possibility that someone who would choose to take the course would do so because they already had different attitudes than someone who would choose not to. It is possible that diversity training works, Paluck concludes, it&rsquo;s just that none of the research that says it does is reliable.</p>

		<p>Here in SoCA, diversity training is often used as a punishment for somebody who made a racially insensitive remark.  When you force ANYONE to go to something like this, they are going to go into it with an automatic bad attitude - the old yuk fu approach.  Nobody wants to be told that their beliefs are wrong and that the HAVE to change.  So yes, they&rsquo;ll go, to keep their job - but change?  No.  &#8220;The man who&rsquo;s forced against his will is of the same opinion still.&#8221;  That old saying was true centuries ago and it&rsquo;s true now.</p>

		<p>I was listening to NPR a few days ago and they were talking about the impact of diversity training on business.  The speakers finding were very similiar to the findings in this article.</p>
<p>What intrigued me the most was a mention of a study (not sure by what organization) that indicated companies who did go through diversity training were less likely to promote minorities into management.  I&rsquo;m not sure what conclusions can be drawn from that, but I found it quite interesting nonetheless.</p>

		<p>Lost in all this hubbub is the long forgotten but inconvenient truth that Coca-Cola and Texaco are in business to sell soda and oil and make a profit in the process.  Evidently, they are now social service agencies that create ineffectual make-work affirmative action jobs, management and otherwise, for racial minorities.  </p>

<p>What these diversity programs likely do is cause paranoia and mistrust. I suspect some of the brighter workers will learn to keep their opinions private while at work but I doubt anything could change anyones mind about what they see around them.</p>
<p>You could give me a power point presentation proving that black workers are just as competent as white workers but once the training ends and the work begins, reality wins.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate that the multinational I work for only requires that we take an online course on diversity. The version I took was an unintentionally humorous cartoon about an elephant that does not like giraffes! </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for anyone else, but diversity training made me feel more biased against giraffes. </p>

<p>It works only on brainwashed, gullible fools, which, thankfully, are only a part of the white population.</p>
<p>On the rest of us, diversity training works only to anger people, and allows them to see the foolishness in the whole concept.</p>

		<p>Diversity training is nothing more than the opportunity for a few Black, Hispanic, White women and liberals (and some conservaitves for that matter)to get jobs and make ample money while accomplishing nothing but creating paranoid, ill feelings and fattening their bank accounts. </p>

		<p>Before it got too dangerous to do so(back some 12-15 years or so)I used to occasionally delight in challenging our corporate HR team on exactly WHY &#8220;Diversity&#8221; was a worthwhile business pursuit at all. Being racially aware, quick on my feet and meticulously careful to never speak too frankly or say anything that could be construed as &#8220;racist,&#8221; I had a hell of a lot fun making these folks(all women at the time) squirm and dance, trying desperately to answer without simply admitting that it wasn&rsquo;t a business pursuit at all - just the PC thing to do!</p>
<p>I did this in a meeting once and had the HR Director so flustered, she finally said we would talk privately after the meeting to better answer my questions, but for now, I should just accept the policies as stated. She obviously knew I was wise to this scheme and to be honest, I got the feeling she wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;true believer&#8221; by any means herself, but realized in her line of work, these things had to be peddled as articles of faith, business interest, profitability, efficiency, etc. be damned! She avoided my like the plaugue after the meeting and we never spoke on anything. I almost felt bad for her and just left well enough alone by that time. </p>

		<p> The whole set of programs this rambling, pointless article discusses is based on a presumption and a fact of life.</p>
<p> The (asinine) presumption is that White males, always and everywhere, have it absolutely knocked, the world by the tail, from the moment of birth, simply because they&rsquo;re White males. The fact of life is that, once you start a network of such &#8220;diversity training&#8221; or whatchamacallit programs, and people land full-time jobs doing &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then no society short of one with an autocratic government hostile to those programs, will ever be able to get rid of them.</p>
<p> Thus, the bad news is, they&rsquo;re here to stay. The good news is, as the novelty continues to wear off (it already has started to) it will become easier and easier to simply go through the motions of complying with them, then go on with one&rsquo;s life, original attitudes intact. Sort of like pretending to worship the god of your conquerers, while continuing to make obeisance to your &#8220;real&#8221; deity in the privacy of your home.</p>

Just because people think they&rsquo;re less prejudiced doesn&rsquo;t mean they are. Indeed, with something as subtle and reflexive as bias, we&rsquo;re often our own worst judges.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be a critic.  If White people feel better after Diversity training, then they are victims of a terrible hoax and are deviant Whites, even race traitors.  The only natural, healthy response to Diversity training is to fully embrace all natural race feeling for the achievements of one&rsquo;s own White race and hold all non white races in total suspicion.</p>
<p>Race prejudice is something holy and good and should be cultivated, developed, and nourished, especially in children. Their survival depends upon it.  If Eve Carson has been more suspicious and wary, she may have not been alone when her &#8220;African American&#8221; kidnappers, robbers, and murderers got their hands on her White, blonde, blue eyed, beautiful ladyhood. </p>
<p><br>
Correct thinking Whites revel in their prejudice against non whites.  The reveling is getting easier, because the non whites are destroying and stealing our White created nation.</p>
<p>Diversity is the embarrassment of all White WWII veterans. If they knew what was going to be done with the &#8220;freedom and democracy&#8221; they fought for, the would have turned the guns in the other direction.  We&rsquo;ve passed a tipping point.  White American soldiers are not ignorant that they are being asked to fight for a country that is becoming mongrelized and destructive to the White families back home.</p>
<p><a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/" rel="nofollow">https://oathkeepers.org/oath/</a></p>
<p>From Wikipedia on Edmund Burke, one of the greatest White thinkers in the history of White Mankind.  May all praises from Heaven flow down and bless the memory and wisdom of Edmund Burke, a pure White hero:</p>
<p>Burke defended prejudice on the grounds that it is &#8220;the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages&#8221; and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison. &#8220;Prejudice&#8221;, Burke claimed, &#8220;is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit&#8221;.[72]</p>
<p><br>
We pledge ourselves to the White Prejudice that renders our White Virtue into our White Habit and White Survival.</p>

		<p>Sure diversity training works, just look at the inaccuracies in this article. It&rsquo;s working quite well, companies and employees take for granted white men, discriminate against them, openly disparage them, and are sometimes hostile to them, and with enough diversity training, no one notices and white men apologize.</p>

<p>By the 1980&rsquo;s, around, say, 1984, the workplace was already filled by loud affirmative action hires, and whites were afraid to talk about anything but the weather, and sometimes afraid to talk about even that, outside of using a whisper. What diversity training and diversity policies did was cement this unequal relationship into law. In a sense to heaping even more racism upon those who have, by this time, known nothing else.</p>

		<p>Where I work at, a white guy got fired for telling a white co-worker, as a joke, and it was a white co-worker, &#8220;get your black-ass over here&#8221;. It wasn&rsquo;t his first incident. If he deserved his bad reputation or not, I couldn&rsquo;t say. But he got the axe. </p>
<p>The exact words used to describe the incident, not in hushed tones, or in private talk from one friend to another, but right out in the open, were the words, &#8220;that red-neck needs to be fired&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a difference between using &#8216;N&rsquo; word and using the word &#8216;red-neck&rsquo;? If there is, I&rsquo;d like to know what it is.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the person who was &#8216;offended&rsquo; and calling for more &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo;, was many time more insensitive than the guy who got fired. And he was fired. The other guy just earned some more brownie points as a long suffering minority, that we need to be more sensitive to. </p>
<p>Thank goodness Our workplace isn&rsquo;t overly obsessed about diversity. </p>

		<p>Actually, workplaces have become such a mine-field, I generally avoid talking to anyone about anything that isn&rsquo;t explicitly work related. It&rsquo;s not a place I socialize. One wrong word and your career is over. I&rsquo;d rather just keep my mouth shut.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m on a hiring committee for a programming professor position at the institution where I teach.  Committee members are encouraged to attend a &#8220;hire the best (wink wink)&#8221; seminar.  I&rsquo;ve attended them before.</p>
<p>So here is my train of thought.  I attend the seminar.  I think to myself, &#8220;Self, we are being told to hire a minority at any cost.&#8221;  Then I think to myself, &#8220;Self, this minority person might have been socially promoted through their schooling.  How can we trust the grades and recommendations they&rsquo;ve been given?&#8221;  Then I go through the process of weeding with the rest of the members who have told themselves similar things.  </p>
<p>If that is the case, then in practice these seminars must work with equal force in the opposite direction of their intent!  Very interesting!!</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t say about the Soviet Union, but during the 40 years under the commie regime in  the Czechoslovakia, the whole population had to spend thousands of hours on ideological training about the bad, bad imperialism and praising of the Soviet Union and much good did it do to the regimes? <br>
People came, sat through, later even made some disparaging remarks in whisper and returned to their workplaces again. I presume that the ridiculous mandatory diversity training sessions must have a similar impact.</p>

		<p>The problem is that no amount of diversity training can change my day to day experiences with others who have different &#8216;cultural values&rsquo; than me.</p>
<p>At my job, the two black workers are very &#8216;culturally different&rsquo; from me and I don&rsquo;t like the values or behavior of either one of them, even though on a personal level they&rsquo;re not &#8216;bad&rsquo; people.  I just don&rsquo;t like the hyper ghetto &#8216;tude the female does, and the male is a flaming black gay with an extremely foul mouth and sassy attitude.  You can&rsquo;t make me like those things, and acceptance means to be okay with something, and you can&rsquo;t make me okay with behavior that repulses me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to be around extreme white trash - motorcycles revving in the yard all night, broken cars all over the street, ignorant discourse, black-like propensities, meth addicts, etc.  Diversity training isn&rsquo;t going to make me like those white people, and I&rsquo;m white.  </p>
<p>People flock together by shared cultural values that are often above considerations of &#8220;purity of race.&#8221;  I socialize with people who have shared cultural attitudes.  I have a lot of non-white friends who share similar such attitudes.  </p>
<p>Diversity training cannot make a person like behavior they abhor.  That&rsquo;s the big blindside in the social justice/diversity movement.  They are not accounting for cultural preferences and view everything in terms of skin color.  Doesn&rsquo;t that make them the biggest racists, or at least, buffoons!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like their arguments that we need more &#8216;minorities&rsquo; in this job or that, and then they say with a straight face that this will bring &#8216;unique&rsquo; perspectives to solve problems.  (Every watch CSI Miami lately?)  Trouble is, market forces determine which worker fits best in a position, not PC or social justice concerns.</p>
<p>When you put a person in a position mainly because of social considerations (skin color, sexual identity, etc) you are saying that the actual requirements and know how for doing the job take a back seat to social engineering, as if just putting a bunch of people of a certain physical characteristic in a slot will automatically make prejudice or dislikes go away.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it true that there is no movement to get blacks, for example, to learn to be less loud among whites.  Some of them self-police, but then complain about it later.  Others are clueless and talk like they&rsquo;re shouting in the company of whites.  Why no diversity training for Asians who often (for cultural reasons) have few if any facial expressions?  All non-Asians use a variety of facial expressions all the time.</p>
<p>Diversity training, unfortunately, is only really directed at whites, and even if there are non whites in the room, the entire thrust is either subtly or blatantly anti-white male in focus.<br>

		<p>From having had to attend Diversity Training in the past all that I see that it produces is greater hostility and distrust. And this among groups of people who prior to the Training got along reasonably well. This I attribute to the way these so called instructor&rsquo;s present the course. It always seemed they strive on creating more White Guilt, and of course more Black Victimhood. I was at one such course where the moronic instructor claimed that it was insulting and insensitive to have to see decorated pine trees in December on display in public, but on private property. Her remedy was that they not be allowed to be displayed within view of the public.</p>

		<p>The article concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It is possible that diversity training works, Paluck concludes, it&rsquo;s just that none of the research that says it does is reliable&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>THIS is the version the government will accept  &mdash;  all empirical evidence and research are flawed and &#8216;not reliable&rsquo;  &mdash;  and the billion-dollar diversity industry will continue apace.</p>
<p>Which government-forced program has ever saved money or done what the politicians promised, and in fact has had the exact opposite result?  Did Medicare save money as was promised?  Did Head Start close the black/white achievement gap or raise black cognitive abilities as was promised?  Did SS come to the aid of &#8216;widows and orphans&rsquo; as was promised?</p>
<p>Do you believe health care will &#8216;pay for itself and indeed will save money&rsquo; as is being promised?  Do you believe illegal colonist amnesty will help &#8216;jump start the economy&rsquo; as is being promised?</p>
<p>If the socialist health care is so wonderful for the American people why are the politicians and their loved ones exempt from it?</p>
<p>Diversity training is pure claptrap, useless garbage foisted on WHITES only while non-Whites are free to degrade, debase and mock Whites openly in the most foul terms possible without threat of prosecution or job loss.  It is an entirely anti-White program, nothing more.</p>
<p>I should know, as a government school employee I&rsquo;ve had these anti-White power point trainings shoved down my throat for years and years and I despise them down to my bone marrow.  </p>
<p>Diversity training tells us that we should ignore all of our experiences with non-Whites, ignore all of the empirical evidence in front of us-everything we&rsquo;ve seen, experienced and are forced to live with concerning non-Whites is wrong and indeed evil and that the diversity industry, the msm and the government are correct when they claim &#8216;White privilege&rsquo; must be eradicated and erased, that &#8216;Diversity = Strength&rsquo; and &#8216;multi-culturalism is desirable&rsquo; (for you as a White, no one else, especially those in power).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see the msm is at least reporting that diversity training does not work, even though the researchers are twisting themselves into knots to deny and distance themselves from their own &#8216;comprehensively surveyed&rsquo; research: &#8216;It is possible that diversity training works (they state) it&rsquo;s just that none of the research that says it does is reliable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The government will re-double its demands for &#8216;Diversity Training&rsquo;, dedicate fiat money for the correct &#8216;research&rsquo; proving DT works, step-up persecutions of White thought crimes and hate speech, and demand, via harsh legislation, more non-Whites be employed by private businesses.</p>
<p>You can be sure the next round of &#8216;comprehensively surveyed&rsquo; data will &#8216;prove&rsquo; once and for all that Diversity Training works exactly as it&rsquo;s supposed to with wonderful results.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t go away.  </p>

		<p>These programs were instituted as a way to claim something was being done.  It is a ticket punched to show good faith.  They have morphed into minority hiring programs since only a minority is qualified to lead them.  The minority is most often black.  Like most in the USA I have attended these mandatory training sessions.  For me these were proactive to inform so that I was sensitized to words and behaviors deemed inappropriate by minorities.  Many of these words and behaviors are not illegal but offensive enough to get you fired.  Many of included references to the offenders being exclusively White.  Similar behaviors by blacks are not offensive because they have been oppressed and come from a history of slavery.    </p>

		<p>At my work, I am on the safety team.  I get an extra hour pay per week for it.  Last week, we made poster boards, nice and pretty with colored paper.  4th grade stuff, but with full pay.  We have a well paid professional safety officer overseeing this important work too.  </p>
<p>The only reason I can see for this is so the company can say to the insurance company, we are doing this.  Give us a discount.</p>

		<p>Diversity programs work in some ways and don&rsquo;t work in others. When the objective is to get whites to willingly go into minority status the programs are a great success. There is hardly a peep of protest coming from whites about our demise. If the objective is to enhance business performance then increasing diversity has been worthless if not destructive.</p>
<p>I do find it funny that these diversity experts are complaining that there is little evidence that diversity training works. They complain that there is no covergence toward best practices. I thought that was the point about the principle of diversity in the first place. Increasing diversity was supposed to recognize that there are no standards or ways of assessing worth. We are not supposed to compare and rank. We are supposed to accept differences without being judgemental. So, by the experts&rsquo; own principle, diversity programs cannot be assessed.</p>

 #4 &#8220;What these diversity programs likely do is cause paranoia and mistrust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good! Then we should endorse Diversity Training.  I know someone who became a raging White Awarian after their training. Being a rational Anglo Saxon, they were enraged that the definitions of &#8220;systemic and institutional racism&#8221; were only applied to the &#8220;unjust social power built upon unearned white privilege.&#8221;  No mention was made of how blacks make millions off shaking down Whites for money and power.</p>
<p>Diversity Training is training in Race Reality.  Whites need to understand the systemic and institutional discrimination against them and the unearned race privileges given to undeserving &#8220;African Americans&#8221;.   Diversity training, anti racist training, sensitivity training, multicultural appreciation training all train the White American Citizens how and by whom we are being dispossessed through the theft of our human and civil rights.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t taken your training, seek out a class and sign up. Try your local Christian church for a scheduled event. All White American Citizens should know the talking points  aimed with hostility directly at their White pursuits of life, liberty, property, and happiness.  </p>
<p>The enemy is not hiding in secret and whispering subversive plans to each other. It&rsquo;s out in the open and easy to find. And it is powerful and working its evil  afrovoodoo black magik against us every day.</p>
<p>All Whites need to know the CONTINUUM ON BECOMING AN ANTI-RACIST MULTICULTURAL INSTITUTION and how these principles are used against us every day.  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/aab9p9" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/aab9p9</a></p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t effectively fight our race enemies until we know their language of &#8220;transformation&#8221; and decipher their evil codes.</p>
<p>We need more White paranoia and distrust. Blacks take the training also, and it institutionalized their perceptions of all Whites possessing racist unearned White privilege. That turns blacks into afrovoodoothugs. They are all spies watching and waiting for Whites to say anything that can be called &#8220;offensive&#8221;, &#8220;painful&#8221;, and &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Paranoid and mistrusting Whites are Race Realists.</p>
<p>Diversity Training = White Awareness = Race Realism</p>
<p>All blacks are spies for the SPLC, ADL, ACLU, and NAACP. They are trained from birth how to shakedown the White Man whenever he says something that hurts them, but they really WANT WHITES TO SPEAK OUT, because that proves &#8220;racism&#8221; and that &#8220;we need to do more!&#8221;, which means Whites must be forced to give more unearned privileges to undeserving blacks.  More affirmative action, more free money, more programs, more power, etc. </p>
<p>When you go to Diversity Training, don&rsquo;t go with a bad attitude or with a plan of confrontation. Go to learn and understand.  At the very end of the seminar, allow yourself to ask just a couple questions for the benefit of the other Whites in the room:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a White parent, should I sacrifice more of my blood and treasure for someone else&rsquo;s black child than I do for my own White child? Should I deny my White child the opportunities and privileges I want to give her, and give these instead to a &#8216;more deserving&rsquo; black child? Can you guarantee that this newly privileged black child will never rob, rape, and murder my White child? If you can&rsquo;t give an iron clad guarantee, then why would I ever consider the wants of blacks over the rights of Whites?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;So, we agree that racism is manifested through Whites having unearned privilege. Under what circumstances is it NOT racism for unearned privileges to be given out based on race? If unearned privilege + Whiteness = racism, and if blackness + empowerment = social justice, and if empowerment = power = privilege, then social justice is just racism in favor of blacks. What will be the logical consequences of teaching us Whites to apply racism in favor of blacks while denying the same benefits of racism to ourselves? Can a system built on such irrationality exist except under totalitarian regime enforced by thuggish tyranny?&#8221;</p>

It was &#8220;taught&#8221; by an &#8220;angry black woman&#8221; who let it be known that all problems could ultimately be traced back to white men.

<p>I have a friend in Toronto who works indirectly for the Province of Ontario. The (Liberal Party-run) Ontario govt is apparently making all govt employees endure a particularly rancid version of Diversity Training: a program devised and written by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, of Mark Steyn/Maclean&rsquo;s Magazine infamy. If you think your Diversity Training was bad, imagine going through a seminar written by people who make their livings dragging conservative journalists through &#8220;Human Rights Tribunals&#8221; (kangaroo courts) and generally trampling on free speech. </p>
<p>My friend   &mdash;   who is by nature somewhat conservative but by no means an AmRen-style racialist   &mdash;   found the whole DT experience infuriating. He said all they did was bash straight white males (which he is) for two solid days. He is now more receptive to AR thinking than before the training. His experience supports what&rsquo;s being said in the above newspaper article: Diversity Training doesn&rsquo;t do any good. </p>
<p>In the long run, it&rsquo;s more likely to do good for OUR side, by giving well-meaning whites a rude awakening as to what Multiculturalism will REALLY mean to white people! </p>
<p><br>
PS.  Among other things my friend reported from his DT sessions is that the new name for &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; has been changed YET AGAIN! Nonwhites are now to be called &#8220;racialized persons.&#8221; Referring to ethnics as &#8220;visible minorities&#8221; is now considered racist, so blacks and other nonwhites have, according to the OHRC, been rebranded as &#8220;racialized persons.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Racialized persons.&#8221; Say it aloud a couple of times. Just comes tripping off the tongue, doesn&rsquo;t it? </p>

<p>  <i>&#8220;Managers, faced with predictions of even greater demographic changes in the workplace in coming decades, turned to diversity courses as a way to respond. Some firms adopted the programs to preemptively head off discord and make themselves more appealing to minority applicants and customers. &#8220;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Businessmen can be so shorted!   Most can&rsquo;t see beyond the next annual report.  These silly fools assume that they and their companies will be there forever,  still operating, as always   &mdash;    just with a new set of happy employees and customers.</p>
<p>What they fail to foresee, far more likely, is that they will all be swept aside with the sweeping change in demography and nothing recognizable will be left of the Old Regime   &mdash;  - including them!  They hope to weather the storm. Such fools.</p>
<p>Those vast &#8220;demographic changes&#8221; portend enormous changes across the board, in everything.  Do they really imagine that the new demographic will be content to work in their factories, shop in their stores, pay them rent and dividends, keep them rich,  mow their lawns, pick their fruits, cook their meals,  and make their beds forever?</p>
<p>The new demographic, or its children, will want a piece of the action&hellip; and ultimately, all of it.</p>

		<p>#28 I think you&rsquo;re right!  What these training seminars do is explicitly inform hiring committee members that they are not qualified or given permission to hire the best person for the position.</p>
<p>The committee I&rsquo;m on was given a dictate to put a &#8220;diversity question&#8221; in our short list of first-round questions.  Our question was found to be lacking and we were ordered to revise it.  This diversity question must be rated and weighted the same as the technical subject matter questions.</p>
<p>Speaking as a rather older woman, I have worked very hard for many years, (some years with little or no money or comforts), in my academic discipline.  I have seen other women advance primarily because of their female status.  It infuriates me that I must figuratively stand with this &#8220;minority&#8221; group.

<p>That, or an economic collapse. The latter would do it.</p>
<p>The fact is that these social engineering programs that companies are forced to implement are luxuries that only a wealthy society can afford. All those &#8220;diversity experts&#8221; with their big salaries and their large staffs, the time for training, etc. are a non-productive burden that all the rest must carry. This mindless worship of Diversity for its own sake is dragging us down. There has to be an eventual reckoning.  In less wealthy, less comfortable, parts of the world, where people have to scramble for a living and businesses can barely manage to stay in business, just by doing business (not social work), they couldn&rsquo;t afford to indulge in such romantic follies. </p>
<p>That will all end here too, when the inevitable hard times come. And they will come because we are damaging our competitiveness and our productivity with this nonsense, mindlessly insisting on the mantra that &#8220;diversity makes us stronger&#8221; while anyone who&rsquo;s clear-sighted can see that it makes us weaker.</p>

		<p>Having sat through a few of these &#8220;diversity&#8221; sessions myself, I can honestly say that each one has always, without fail, turned into a beat-down on white males. </p>
<p>White guys sit in the back, lips pressed firmly together, a scowl on their faces, as they listen to an endless diatribe of how Shaunquita so-and-so has suffered ever so horribly, or how Davontale such-and-such has worked so hard to prove he&rsquo;s capable, or how Sally SoccerMommy feels that every white guy in the place is always &#8220;undressing&#8221; her with their eyes. </p>
<p>Then the &#8220;evil&#8221; white guys go back to their desks, barely visible beneath the mountain of work they must complete, while the oh-so-downtrodden blacks go back to shuckin&rsquo; and jivin&rsquo; in the break room and Sally SoccerMommy struts up and down the hallway in her teeny-weeny skirt and hopelessly tight silk blouse. </p>

		<p>To poster #25:  The whole 4th grade poster board thing is really big in education this day, for both high schoolers and teachers taking training.  What passes for work in a high school classroom nowadays is atrocious.  (&#8220;Do you need more glitter Shaquanda?  Now use the safety scissors on your construction paper, Francisco, and not on your hand.  You want to be ready for college, don&rsquo;t you?&#8221;)</p>
<p>When they get us teachers together for &#8216;professional development,&rsquo; the big things are &#8216;trust building&rsquo; exercises where we reveal secrets to each other or get paired randomly to interview and &#8216;share out&rsquo; what we learned about each other and ourselves, etc&hellip;  Oh, we also write these big sentences on those big easel paper pads.  We have a recorder, a timer, etc&hellip;  Can&rsquo;t wait for the share out after discussing some irrelevent topic!</p>
<p>The teacher training is where this diversity stuff is pushed the most, and all older teachers are driven crazy by the inanity of it all.  (That&rsquo;s why they want to fire teachers at will - Arne Duncan and crew, because the &#8216;dead wood&rsquo;: read knowledgeable older crowd, won&rsquo;t go along with the race to the bottom.)  The younger teachers, who were raised on the self-esteem stuff of the last 20 years, eat it up.</p>
<p>Really, the under 25 crowd is a wonder to behold.  So sensitive, so needy, so in need of talking out their feelings, so unsure, so without content knowledge of any kind, so ripe for blaming the evil &#8216;system&rsquo; for being so big and scary.</p>
<p>You know we&rsquo;re headed down.  Only white societies (excluding Eastern Europe) are doing this collective cultural suicide thing.  No Asians, Latin American countries or Africans are going all soft and touchy feely.  They&rsquo;re as rapacious and greedy as ever.  I just wonder what the bottom will hold.</p>
<p>In a future world where England is a black and Asian country, where France is just another Arab country, where North America is a collection of black, Asian and Latino mini-countries, where will whites be?  Where can they go to be safe?  Do you think in a world where whites are no more than 5% of the population anywhere that your pretty blonde daughter will be safe?  </p>
<p>Will whites be like the Jews and forcibly create a state somewhere as an historic &#8216;homeland&rsquo; to be safe from pogroms and oppression?  The endgame is at hand, and who knows how long it will be before illegal Mexican or African immigrants are washing over the cities of China and Eastern Europe, looking for more freebies?  (Oh, the diversity crowd will be there, waiting to try their programs there, but by then, there will be so many people and so few resources to go around that a major collapse will be inevitable.)</p>

<p>Race Ambivalence + Diversity Training = Race Awareness</p>
<p>Race Awareness + Race Integration (Multiculturalism) =  White Frustration</p>
<p>White Frustration + White Community = Race Potential<br>

		<p>Diversity is a WEAKNESS!  Ten worst cabbies in NY and not one of them is white (black, muslim, hispanic):</p>

		<p>Diversity &#8220;training&#8221; is simply absurd denial of the obvious, to wit, certain minorities and particularly blacks, aren&rsquo;t equipped intellectually or temperamentally to compete in a modern economy. And no amount of special dispensation granted them is going to change this dismal reality.</p>
<p>Expecting them to be equally represented as engineers, scientists, doctors, PhDs, architects, etc. is on its face an absurd goal, no less so than expecting Vietnamese or Thais to be statistically represented equally in the NBA. Of course, were this to become a serious issue, doubtless there would be those who claimed that their shorter stature was due to discrimination in their nutrition.</p>
<p>At some point this society is going to have to face the reality that there are significant intellectual differences between the races and that these difference account for nearly all of the disparities in achievement between races.  </p>

  <i>&#8221; The younger teachers, raised on the self-esteem stuff of the last 20 years, eat it up.  Really, the under-25 crowd is a wonder to behold. So sensitive, so in need of talking out their feelings, so unsure, so without content knowledge of any kind, so ripe for blaming the evil &lsquo;system&rsquo; &hellip;.<br>
You know we&rsquo;re headed down. Only white societies (excluding Eastern Europe) are doing this collective cultural suicide thing. No Asians, Latin American countries,  or Africans are going all soft and touchy feely. They&rsquo;re as rapacious and greedy as ever. I just wonder what the bottom will hold.&#8221;</i>   &mdash;  - Jay </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>How true!   Forgive me if I&rsquo;ve said it before, but only a very wealthy society;  a comfortable, secure society;  a soft, self-indulgent society,  can afford the luxury to dabble and play in such social experiments, such self-flagellation, such abandonment of learning and hard knowledge in favor of touchy-feely self-exploration, racial groveling,  and  endless obeisance to &#8220;sensitivity&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Those spoiled and frivolous under-25ers, raised in a world where America has been the world&rsquo;s sole Great Power and they&rsquo;ve known nothing else, are taking our preeminence and security and wealth completely for granted&hellip; they are resting on our laurels. Always a disastrous mistake!</p>
<p>Our competitors, who see life as a ruthless struggle for dominance (and care nothing about sensitivity), will surpass us;  and  eventually the piper will have to be paid.  But too late!</p>
<p>China already owns us.  Anyday they choose, they&rsquo;re going to let us know it.</p>
