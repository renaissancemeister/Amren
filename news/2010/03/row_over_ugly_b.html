			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Wells, Sun (London), March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>GOOGLE has been hit by a race row after its search engine asked: &#8220;Why are black people so ugly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Millions of outraged users across the world saw the sickening question after simply entering the word &#8220;why&#8221;.</p>
<p>The offensive phrase is thought to have popped up for several weeks.</p>
<p>Sun reader Warren Degallerie, 23, from Croydon, South London, said: &#8220;I was helping my nine-year-old niece with her homework. Before she knew it that line had appeared. We are both black and I couldn&rsquo;t believe something like that could be allowed to happen. I had to try to explain to a young girl how Google could let it appear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sun alerted Google bosses on Thursday and they fixed the glitch, apologising for the blunder. A spokesman said it was caused by a feature which predicts what users are about to ask.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Google Suggest is an automated feature that aims to make searching easier by providing suggestions as you type, based on what other people have searched for previously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have filters to eliminate inappropriate suggestions, but very occasionally an offensive suggestion may slip through. We encourage anyone who sees one to raise it through our help centre and forums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google has been caught in race storms before. Last year it at first refused to remove a link to a sick cartoon showing US First Lady Michelle Obama as a chimpanzee, arguing &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221;.</p>
<p>And in 2007 it allowed stories about a black US business tycoon to be linked to pictures of monkeys.<br>

		<p>Indeed, a burning question. Well, I suppose there&rsquo;s some legitimacy to it, since black Africans in general don&rsquo;t conform to most accepted norms of human beauty.  I suppose the question might have been more subtly put as, for example, why do black men prefer white women?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s funny, I recall a chain email making the rounds a few years ago that compared George W. Bush to several monkey faces, but I don&rsquo;t remember it being described as &#8220;sick&#8221;.  A good chuckle was had by all, probably including this fraudulently outraged journalist.</p>

I find the auto fill in feature to be both a positive and a negative. The negative (which is purely personal) is that I don&rsquo;t like a search engine knowing what question I&rsquo;m going to ask. The positive is that it does help speed up and sort out searches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing feature but I now fear that political correctness is going to cause search engines to alter or censor their algorithms.</p>
<p>I just tried the question on goole and it doesn&rsquo;t auto-fill. However, when you type in the full question, you do get results. I suspect the next step is going to be to ban results that some consider offensive or hurtful.</p>
<p>Watch for groups to type in any &#8216;offensive&rsquo; searchs and then demand that the search engines not link to &#8216;offensive&rsquo; hits.</p>

		<p>Interesting. I just hopped onto Google, and the specific question &#8220;why are black people so ugly&#8221; didn&rsquo;t appear. However, &#8220;why are black girls so ugly&#8221; and &#8220;why are black women so ugly&#8221; did appear. Could be Google &#8220;fixed&#8221; that since this article went to press.</p>
<p>However, I do have a beef with Yahoo. I&rsquo;ve been a Yahoo mail user for over a decade. When I try to log into my email, the sign-on screen comes up with an ad for their mail service on the left side of the screen (and just why do they need an ad? I&rsquo;m trying to sign onto their service for crying out loud!). They have pictures in the ads (they rotate), and for the last couple of months, there have been about 5 pictures rotating in the loop. Two of the five are of black people, and every time one of them appears, I hit the refresh button on my browser or purposely mess up the login just so I don&rsquo;t have to look at their ugly mugs. I&rsquo;m sick of it. If my Yahoo mail account hasn&rsquo;t been my standard personal email address for over 12 years, I wouldn&rsquo;t use it anymore.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, the question was &#8220;sickening&#8221; and another cartoon was &#8220;sick.&#8221; Nothing like keeping one&rsquo;s own opinions out of a news story, eh? </p>
<p>What strikes me is the sheer triviality of this story. A conference can be shut down with death threats and with all kinds of ominous connotations for freedom of speech and the media isn&rsquo;t interested, but let a computer system suggest an inappropriate phrase, and my God! It&rsquo;s a national scandal!</p>
<p>Maybe a more appropriate question is &#8220;Why are black people so petty  and easily offended?&#8221;</p>

		<p> Funny how these things just keep popping up, isn&rsquo;t it? Do you suppose that maybe, just maybe, some black of the type who likes to hang a noose in front of his dorm room door, then express outrage at &#8220;finding&#8221; it there, might have put that on Google just to provoke, well, &#8220;outrage&#8221;?</p>
<p> Personally, I think if that question were going to be included under &#8220;Why&#8221; then a photo of Whoopi Goldberg should have been affixed to it as an illustration of the point.</p>

		<p>My understanding is that a search engine is a cold, mathematical, human less process. <br>
Presumably in this case the programme was &lsquo;auto filling&rsquo; a phrased question from the previously most common asked, similar worded phrasing.<br>
Strange question though.<br>
When I put the word &lsquo;why&rsquo; into my regional version of google, the second &lsquo;why result&rsquo; is <i>&ldquo;why can&rsquo;t i own a Canadian&rdquo; </i> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzs5kt6" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzs5kt6</a> .<br>
And the seventh &lsquo;why result&rsquo; is <i> &ldquo;why do indians smell&rdquo; </i> <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yh9v4yc" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yh9v4yc</a>,which would get us into lots of trouble with some of resent press of course, but then the results are world wide.</p>
<p>I love the freedom of the internet but in terms of popularity and what is the most requested information, it is truly a reflection of most people&rsquo;s interests.<br>
And most people are choose mental &ldquo;junk food.&rdquo;<br>
Just look at <a href="https://www.google.com/trends" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/trends</a> and/or the popularity of porn for instances.</p>
<p>The fact that &#8216;Black&rsquo; and &#8216;ugly&rsquo; are a popular word combination, could actually be in a positive context also(from a Black POV) i.e. &#8220;isn&rsquo;t it ashame that Blacks still experience such ugly racism.&#8221; It&rsquo;s just unfortunate that this particular phrasing generated &#8216;the hit.&rsquo;<br>
It looks like politically correct filters will be a web designers must in the future(present), like obama+monkey=no result.</p>

		<p>It is unfortunate that a question of aesthetics should be held up to such postured censure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should be noticed that whilst the dominant and ascendant black man values the white female above all else; very few normal white males value black &#8216;females&rsquo; in quite the same way.</p>
<p>At the moment, perceptions of &#8216;attractiveness&rsquo; are still free (as I know to my own cost), though given the normative influence of the media, I wonder for how long this will remain the case?</p>

<p>While they may stab us in our faces with their absurd &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; it does speak toward truth. Particularly, toward a truth that is not a &ldquo;wizard,&rdquo; or a witch, that can &ldquo;enrich&rdquo; us.</p>

		<p>To have one&rsquo;s very sense of self-worth hanging on the previous inquiries of a search engine has to be a terrible thing. </p>
<p>Warren Degallerie and the uber-politically correct author of the article, Tom Wells, seem to believe that blacks, like impressionable infants, must be protected from every hint of disapproval from whites.  </p>
<p>Good grief, people: get over it!  Google is just a search engine and produces similar negative results about white people&hellip; but 99⅖% of us just don&rsquo;t care.<br>

<p>This is not the case where I live. I live in an upper class area as well.If anything it is generation Y or millenials as they are called who are very liberal in their social views. They are also much more inclined to date across racial lines.</p>
<p>Sad but true.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure Google could easily prove &#8220;Why are black people so ugly?&#8221; was entered over a million times last month, so of course the suggest feature puts it at the top. If this woman wants to be angry at someone, she should start with the rest of the world and leave Google alone. Just another case of blacks claiming raw facts to be &#8220;racist&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>I too see alot of miscegenation happening among Generation Y. You have to realize that these are the children of the mid to latter baby boomers those born 1953 and 1964. </p>
<p>It should not be surprising that they would adopt the values of their parents. Even silent generation people like Chris Matthews,(who married a later boomer wife) gushes how his children frequently date across racial lines and &#8220;never even mention the fact that their frinedsor teachers are Black.&#8221; it is only Ms. or mr so-and so. You don&rsquo;t find out this fact until you meet them.</p>
<p>It is disgusting. </p>

		<p>Went to Google with the question and did find a discussion forum of a couple of pages filled with crying outraged liberals.  So they put a photo of Tyra Banks on line several times to prove how beautiful black people are.  Of course Tyra Banks is as close to white as one can be without actually being white. So the irony is they try to prove blacks are beautiful by showing a person with virtually no black blood. Funny.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I have actually heard Chris Matthews mention this sad rhetoric. He and Andrea Mitchell were talking with Pat Buchanan about race in America during the 2008 campaign. </p>
<p>He was saying things to Buchanan just like you mentioned  about his children dating outside the race etc&hellip;and &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that the kind of world you want to live in Pat?&#8221; etc&hellip;</p>
<p>It made me want to puke!!!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m certain that it crossed Mr. Degallerie&rsquo;s mind to go after the big Google and concoct a lawsuit due to emotional distress.  That seems to be the routine line of thinking for blacks faced with this type of situation.</p>

		<p>If all you had to do was enter the world &#8220;why&#8221;, to get &#8220;Why are Black people so ugly?&#8221;, then an astonishingly large number of people had recently entered that query.</p>
<p>My guess is that it is BLACK KIDS, who, in the privacy of their own rooms, entered that question.  Our computers are kind of like diaries, now&hellip;receiving our most forbidden thoughts.  This may be what is on the minds of brighter Black kids.  And by &#8216;ugly&rsquo;, I suspect they mean more than just looks.  They look around, and equate black looks with black behavior.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t help but feel for them.  I can imagine their desperate self-loathing&hellip;.soon to transmogrify into the almost inevitable loathing of whites.  What&rsquo;s pitiable today is dangerous, tomorrow.</p>
