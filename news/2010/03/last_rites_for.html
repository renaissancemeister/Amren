			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vikki Campion, Daily Telegraph (Sydney), March 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ENGLISH-SPEAKING parishioners have been forced out of a church in Sydney&rsquo;s north with its service now to be heard solely in Korean. </p>
<p>Denistone East Uniting Church will hold its final English service this Sunday.</p>
<p>The community that has replaced bygone eras in Denistone is &#8220;delightfully Asianised&#8221;, Reverend Les Pearson said, with at least 120 keen Korean Christians packing each sermon.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when church-going for Caucasian people seems to be diminishing, it is a healthy thing for our church to become more ethnic,&#8221; Rev Pearson said on the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is society dictating to the church and the church responding to that. It would have been easy to say &#8216;This is an Aussie church&rsquo; but it would have been unreasonable and wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in a land enriched by migrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sixty years ago founder Rod Field painted a promise of things to come: &#8220;This is the site of the Denistone East Methodist Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a simple sign on a cow paddock surrounded by orchards which were being carved up into suburban Sydney.</p>
<p>After 57 years of Sundays, this final English service would be sad, Mr Field said, but it was better that a Korean congregation use the church than none at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not have put up a new sign saying it was to be closed. It would have been too emotional,&#8221; the 86-year-old said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting up a sign saying it was going Korean &hellip; I could do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long-time parishioner Ron Hoffmann, 77, will miss his tiny church of 49 years that he will be leaving for its big sister at Eastwood.</p>
<p>But he understands the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a very caring church, everyone knows everybody. I will always remember its heyday where the Sunday school had 300 children, our youth group had 70 teenagers and at Christmas you couldn&rsquo;t fit everybody into this hall,&#8221; Mr Hoffmann said.</p>
<p>Korean Pastor Jim Ho Cho said there was huge demand for more Korean services and with English cancelled, he could run two morning services on Sunday as well as evening services during the week.<br>

		<p>No one, including Koreans in Korea, want their country&rsquo;s language and culture so drastically changed. I can sympathize with the white Australians. I believe in tough immigration laws, but I don&rsquo;t hate Koreans. I live in Southern California, home to hundreds of thousands of Koreans. There&rsquo;s bad in every group, but I like most of them. They work hard, have prosperous businesses, they are good doctors, etc. I have even studied TKD with them. Most of the Koreans are actually conservatives and have many of the same values you do. Koreans are good to have on your side. If there has to be immigration, I would prefer Koreans (or similar).</p>

		<p>This happened to my old Presbyterian church in NJ, a church family members helped found, as the church became progressively liberal, my family drifted away, leaving behind years of work, thousands of dollars of donated resources and most of all, memories of a time when the institutional churches celebrated, guided, and supported the culture that gave them birth and sustained them.<br>
About ten years ago the presbytery sold the buildings and land to a &ldquo;Korean Presbyterian&rdquo; congregation, nowadays all signage and services are in Korean, and all traces of the church&rsquo;s founders and original heritage have been removed, this in the church that saw my own baptismal only some 55 years ago<br>

		<p>&#8220;Delightfully Asianised&#8221; is a ridiculous, newspeak term. I live in this area, and I have taught many Koreans. Religion for them is not so much a matter of faith or Christian principles, but a means for holding together as a xenophobic enclave. Very few of them have any idea of the tenets of their religion, and most merely call themselves Christians. They don&rsquo;t know if they are Baptists or Methodists or Presbyterian or Uniting. They insist that Catholics are not Christians. Some I have known who go to Lutheran schools think their school is named after Martin Luther King. </p>
<p>The church at Denistone will not continue so much as a place of Christian worship as a place of Korean nationalism, from which non-Koreans will be excluded. </p>

		<p>Is everybody noticing how &#8220;birds of a feather flock together?&#8221;  ALL racial groups tend to move to the same neighborhoods and take over the same areas of businesses, schools, and churches.  It is a natural thing!!  So WHY is it that the PC idiots get so p&rsquo;o&rsquo;d about whites sticking together?  This is insane!  We have just as much right to stick together as any other group!  Hey, I&rsquo;m headin&rsquo; for the foothills - it&rsquo;s the smartest thing I can see to do.  Let the blacks and Mexicans have Mexifornia cities - they already do anyway.</p>

		<p>Well, the thing is Anonymous, we DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO HAVE IMMIGRATION.  What has it gotten us?  What good has it done us?  Ever since our traitorous government made it impossible for Europeans to immigrate, and gave preferential treatment to the Third World for legal immigration, while advertising our borders as Wide Open to any illegals who want to come here, this country is rapidly going down the tubes.  There is NO NEED to have immigration at all, in point of fact.  None.  We have more than enough people of our own.  We should completely shut down immigration both legal and illegal and deport ALL who have not yet become citizens, and end citizenship services for all but European Whites.  I agree with you in general about Koreans.  But tell me why we need Koreans, Japanese, or any other race or nationality coming here?  We have far too many right now.  </p>

		<p>Reply to anon at #1:</p>
<p>Sorry but I wholeheartedly disagree with what you say. Being REPLACED by polite, hard-working Koreans is ultimately no different then being REPLACED by rude and lazy blacks (or any other race). REPLACEMENT is REPLACEMENT. The end result is the same. There may be a high road and a low road but they both lead to the same place - REPLACEMENT. I have no desire at all to be &#8220;Asianized&#8221;, (&#8220;delightfully&#8221; or otherwise).</p>
<p>By the way why exactly does there &#8220;have to be immigration&#8221; anyways?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against Koreans. But if I had to choose between closing the doors on a piece of my heritage or turning it over to someone else I&rsquo;d rather just burn it down.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to speculate here.  White churches, particularly the &#8220;mainstream protestants&#8221;, have a lot of resources, land, buildings, non-religious property, foundations and endowments.  By driving away serious Christians with their multi-culti Marxist sermonizing, the clergy and hierarchy get to keep all the institutional wealth for themselves.  They complain about empty pews, but continue to drive their congregations away.  What&rsquo;s going on?<br>
     When the pews are empty, who owns the property?  Who controls the endowments built up by generations of Christians remembering the church in their wills?  When the Methodist and Presbyterian churches are dissolved, who will pocket the money?  The clergy.  They will sell all the property, pay the remaining debts, and keep the rest as retirement.  <br>
     But maybe the churches won&rsquo;t be dissolved.  Is it possible that the Koreans are simply planning to take over certain churches, keep their tax-free status, and use them as political/cultural centers?  They have the model of the Black churches in America, which regularly violate their tax free status but are never called on it.  <br>
     If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d rather the ex-preachers were living it up in Las Vegas.  </p>

		<p>When I hear talk of people of color being good Christians I feel a sense of unease. It seems to me that colored people&rsquo;s claim of being Christian is more a ruse than anything else. Whether it is voodoo, offering sacrifices to evil spirits, or demons, it strikes me that people of color are drawn to dark forces. This practice of worshiping dark forces is not the path to God. </p>

		<p>When a church or other institution adopts a language that few others speak, then there is no more chance for outreach or &#8216;inclusion&rsquo;.  Don&rsquo;t people realize that.  Some average joe off the street couldn&rsquo;t wander in to the korean church to seek guidance, becuase he would not understand the language used in the sermon or literature.  </p>
<p>Also, to poster #3, I live in a heavily chinese and korean area and I can attest to what you have said.  The Koreans have no clue about christianity and all its variables, nuances and sub sects.  They literally use it as a social networking site.  They throw up a new church every day or so with the name of so many different denominations - baptist, lutheran, etc..  Those divisions were made in Europe centuries ago.  They have no context in korea or among koreans.</p>
<p>Is buddhism so bad that every single korean who steps off the boat here joins a church?</p>

		<p>I agree with poster # 5..</p>
<p>Yet the problem with even keeping the nonwhite immigrants since 1965 creates a bigger problem. There are millions upon millions of them including all their offspring and they keep on having more. They will far outnumber us in a few short years, if not already. Their children already outnumber White children. That is a bad omen right there. Their culture and religion for the most part are not compatible with European peoples and the traitors who brought them all here KNOW that. So what we need to do is expose the traitors and their AGENDA. Genocide of Whites worldwide.</p>

		<p>I, too, live near a delightfully Asianized area, and I can attest that there is no greater fraud than a Korean &#8220;church.&#8221; As an earlier commentator pointed out, Korean churches are ethnocentric clubhouses but they also serve a more lucrative financial purpose   &mdash;    land acquisition. As the collection plate goes around on Sunday (or whenever), money is appropriated to buy up existing church properties and, increasingly, empty commercial properties. These commercial properties are outfitted to host &#8220;church&#8221; functions - tax free, of course, due to the religious exclusion - but they are also used as common office space for a bevy of Korean businesses (both of the genuine and &#8220;shell&#8221; variety). These businesses are highly profitable because there is little or no overhead, and a portion of the additional profits can be used&hellip;wait for it&hellip;.to buy NEW &#8220;church&#8221; properties! Once a new property is to be acquired, the old &#8220;church&#8221;/commercial building is sold to another Korean for a fabulous profit.</p>
<p>See how the Korean business cycle works? Koreans formerly ran their SBA loan/insider sales Ponzi schemes to build capital from structured sales of nail shops, dry cleaners, and sometimes convenience stores but now they are more likely to use the religious tax exclusion as their primary scheme to get rich off the White man&rsquo;s toil and subsidy. Like Indians, they produce virtually nothing yet build immense personal and collective wealth that remains in their own community (to a degree that is not allowed for Whites). The model minority, my eye.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried? Would you even want to? I have a feeling it&rsquo;s not so much Asians &#8220;excluding&#8221; you, as it is you just not feeling comfortable in that atmosphere. This seeming lack of good-will from Korean-Americans that many of you are expressing sounds somewhat exaggerated.</p>

		<p>Post #13 highlights just some of the reasons why the tax exemption for religious establishments needs to be eliminated and fast.  This is how Islam operates cash cows in the U.S. for supporting terrorism.  IN the old days, it was little more than the &#8220;Elmer Gantry&#8221; style Christian financial empires that mocked both Christianity and the tax payer.  Now, it is a matter of national and racial/ethnic security.</p>

		<p>I can only agree with the comments that these Korean churches are not the real deal. In Seoul, neon crosses dot the night sky - the first impression you have is that Christianity is booming. However, when you actually speak to Koreans on the matter you find their understanding of Christianity is basic at best and they are nothing like what we in the west put in the bracket of &#8216;Christians&rsquo;. I think you could almost call it a cultural quirk of theirs.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons Christianity is dying amongst whites (but not Koreans) is that Korean-brand Christianity is delightfully ethnocentrized, serving as a focal point for the cultural as well as the religious aspects of its community. Christianity in white churches has felt a call to embrace all peoples and the white population living in white-majority countries, except for small ethnic groups like Greeks, feels that its cultural needs are adequately served outside of the church. To the extent that it embraces anything culturally European, it is a culture that is popular the world over. Yes, ironically, European culture is a weakness because it&rsquo;s so damn great.</p>
<p>The universalism that is part, but not an essential feature, of Christianity as practiced by whites will lead it&rsquo;s ultimate destruction, and the destruction of the whites it once served.</p>
<p>You often hear that Christianity is &#8220;a religion of compassion&#8221; - mostly by people who find most of the Old Testament (not to mention books like Revelations) to embarassing to ponder. So it reduces Christianity down to the socially acceptable elements like &#8220;compassion&#8221; and forgets that the Bible ever mentions things like sin, obedience, and war. It forgets that the Old Testament is, in fact, passionately ethnocentric.</p>

		<p>The Koreans are moving into a vacuum. It is the white population that has abandoned not just Christianity but a Christian community which includes but does not consist solely of a church. Don&rsquo;t blame the Koreans - ask why Europeans have abandoned their own religious tradition. In those parts of the US where Christianity remains a living tradition, there is no trouble maintining the &#8216;ethnic purity&rsquo; (as Jimmy Carter would have called it) of the church congregation.</p>
<p>As for the ethnocentrism of Korean churches - we&rsquo;ve seen this with previous waves of immigrants, so this is not new news.</p>

		<p>I was born and raised a Christian all my life.  Both of my parents are Christians.  None of my family members were ever home on Sundays.  We were at church. (I am the only child)  </p>
<p>This article indeed made me very sad. </p>
<p>There was something I noticed.  If you look at the picture in the page, most people of the congregation are seniors, and the article also reads, </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;It&rsquo;s a very caring church, everyone knows everybody. I will always remember its heyday where the Sunday school had 300 children, our youth group had 70 teenagers and at Christmas you couldn&rsquo;t fit everybody into this hall,&#8221; Mr Hoffmann said.&#8221; </p>
<p>We can conclude that the number of young Christians in the congregation decreased over time.  </p>
<p>I blame the mainstream media&hellip;.  For a very long time, the mainstream media never stopped describing Christianity as &#8220;wimpy&#8221; and &#8220;inferior&#8221; whereas the mainstream media constantly glorified and praised muslims and hindus.  In Hollywood movies, the only bad people are Christians, but muslims or other non-white non-Christians never ever do anything bad.  They only do great things (and a great match for white women)  </p>
<p>When non-white muslims or hindus do something bad, the mainstream media becomes deafening silent.  If a Christian man ever does something bad, it becomes the frontpage headline for the next three months.  </p>
<p>The mainstream media also never ever has any courage to say anything negative about the black rap musicians who love being rebellious, and refuse to go to school to receive education and what does that do?  It convinces young people to be more like them!</p>
<p>and as a result the mainstream media successfully convinced more and more young people in North America and Australia to believe that it is &#8220;wimpy&#8221; &#8220;boring&#8221; and &#8220;uncool&#8221; to be a Christian in modern times, but it is really cool and trendy to be a non-Christian.   </p>
<p>When I was in highschool, and to this day, I know it never made me any less cool to be a Christian, and be open about it.  I was always very open about the fact that I was a Christian and never stopped encouraging other non-Christian people of my age to read the Bible.  What kind of a spiritual belief a man lives by, never determines how cool( or uncool) he is.  If I ever had anyone&rsquo;s admiration while I was in highschool, it was NOT related to the fact that I was a Christian.  For example, I sometimes helped my classmates better understand math concepts, and those little things such as this, made me &#8220;truly super cool&#8221;</p>
<p>I am sorry I could not post as often on AmRen for the past couple of weeks&hellip;. I landed myself a position as a dynamic content developer just a little while ago.  My boss, who is also a generous mentor to me, is a white man who worked at Google as an intern in the past.  He is still fairly young.  We have three very exciting, although extremely challenging, projects going on.  We decided not to be scared though.  If we are scared, or too much afraid of failure, we won&rsquo;t be able to accomplish anything.  I like the fact that I get to make a plenty of decisions, and it forces me to be creative and find solutions, rather than doing only what I am assigned to do.  I am the only non-white developer here.    </p>
<p>If you want to hear about my current responsibilities&hellip;.</p>
<p>- develop query interface<br>
- develop output interface <br>
- develop an algorithm (better be extremely creative for this part)</p>
<p>I must complete and submit the outline for the algorithm by tomorrow.  Right beside my desk, I stacked the empty bottles of Pepsi I consumed for the past several days while I was working, and I am moderately amused at, and you won&rsquo;t find it easy to believe, how many bottles of Pepsi I recently consumed while I was working.  </p>
<p>The rest of the projects, such as hardware/server maintenance and DBMS, will be taken care of by my boss or someone else in the company.  One of my co-workers, is an MIT graduate and he is fantastic!! he came here before I did, and I admit he is clearly more knowledgeable than me.  He was also a TA and taught a few classes while he was at MIT.  he is very easy going, and he likes joking around.  he is truly helping me grow and discover new worlds.  He is a truly enjoyable man to be around.  </p>
<p>A lot of developers around the world think algorithm is the most important part of any project, but that can&rsquo;t be further away from the truth!!! it is a combination of everything.  There isn&rsquo;t really any part of the whole project that is any less important than any other part.  </p>
<p>There are a few things I would definitely recommend other AmRen members, or AmRen members&rsquo; young family members, who are intending to enter the industry, but if I write them here, this post will be too long.  I assure that I will post them shortly in the near future.   </p>
<p>I will pray everyday for the rest of my life, and read the Bible for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>&#8220;There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent&#8221;  [Luke 15:7]</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see&#8221;  [Hebrews 11:1]  </p>

<p>The thing I despise about Koreans is that they aren&rsquo;t native Christians. They are newcomers to Christianity who have almost no knowledge of the rich history of the Christian faith, it&rsquo;s varying branches and the theological differences that set them apart and, frankly, I don&rsquo;t think they care. As someone else already said, these &#8220;churches&#8221; are really Korean cultural centers more than anything else. </p>
<p>The only reason many of them took to Christianity in Korea is because Asians have this wierd pathology about trying to distinguish themselves from other Asians and they try to use European languages and religions to do it. The Vietnamese loudly proclaim that they speak French and that this makes them &#8220;better&#8221;. The Fillipinos think they are &#8220;better&#8221; because the Spanish mated with some of their Malay ancestors 200 years ago and left Catholicism behind. Now, in a rush to outdo the Fillipinos and Vietnamese, the Koreans are embracing Protestantism at break-neck speed because I guess they think it makes them &#8220;better&#8221; than the Fillipinos and Vietnamese? </p>

		<p>21 Anon: As you describe them, the Orientals that embrace some aspect of Western culture in order to set themselves above their neighbors, sound very much like Whites who embrace multiculturalism in order to look down on other Whites.  </p>

		<p>-#21, your point is only partially correct. If you take a look at the numbers, approximately 75% of south korea is christian. Christianity in korea goes back at least a century, if not more. Many Koreans are actually very devout christians. Although for the life of me I cannot figure out why they would want to be christian, I think any educated person would be able to research and see the contradictions in christianity and the bible for themselves. But without digressing any further, your assertions regarding koreans overnight conversion to christianity is a bit of a flawed assumption. </p>

		<p>Ironic, especially considering that Koreans now have lower birth rates than even Eastern European whites.</p>
