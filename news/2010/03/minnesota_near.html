			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Johns, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s students once again outperformed much of the nation on reading tests in 2009, but the achievement gap between black and white students hasn&rsquo;t budged in almost 20 years, according to test results released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s persistent, vexing achievement gap has become a long-term blemish on an otherwise good reputation for educational performance. The 2009 results of what&rsquo;s commonly called the &#8220;Nation&rsquo;s Report Card&#8221; show that Washington, D.C., is the only jurisdiction with a black-white gap statistically larger than Minnesota&rsquo;s in fourth grade, and that Connecticut is the only state with a larger gap in eighth grade, although some states didn&rsquo;t report enough data to be counted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really going to devote some significant additional money to trying to focus on our minority students and the achievement gap,&#8221; Seagren said, &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we&rsquo;re going to be looking at the whole continuum of schools, not only in elementary school, but middle and high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, the state plans to use part of $34 million it recently received for the state&rsquo;s lowest-performing schools to improve reading instruction for the state&rsquo;s most at-risk students.</p>
<p>Educators can&rsquo;t let the achievement gap&rsquo;s stubbornness frustrate them, said Mike Savage, the educational coordinator at Forest Hills Elementary School in Eden Prairie, which saw its reading scores jump and its achievement gap narrow on state tests last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not need to assume that a racial disparity is something that is just going to be there,&#8221; said Savage, who advocates research-based methods when he trains staff on how to teach reading. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a question of how willing you are to meet the individual needs of students and how willing you are to know and understand that every child in your classroom has different needs.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Complex causes</b></p>
<p>The gap between white and black fourth-graders hasn&rsquo;t narrowed since 1992, the first year data were available. The same is true of eighth-graders since 1998, the first year of available data for that grade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s test results &#8220;should be the latest wake-up call to Minnesota that it&rsquo;s time to seriously deal with the achievement gap,&#8221; President Tom Dooher said in a news release.</p>
<p>Dooher said the causes of the achievement gap are &#8220;complex,&#8221; with roots in socioeconomic issues.</p>

		<p>	You can&rsquo;t fake intelligence.<br>
	<br>
We have a serious problem with the bureaucrats in the US and Europe who dismiss black failure in achievement as a social condition: when the reality is, that blacks simple lack the cognitive ability to function well in a complex society; you can&rsquo;t fix the problem, by pretending the problem doesn&rsquo;t exist. <br>
	<br>
The Blacks will continue to be under achievers&hellip; until the whites admit that the blacks lack the intellectual capacity to compete; the black struggle will indeed be more pronounced&hellip; if the whites fail to edify the blacks of their culture disparity as well.<br>

		<p>How vexing to the &#8220;educators&#8221; in Minnesota that the achievement gap between whites and blacks won&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>I mean, we all know that race is a social construct and that all races are exactly equal in intelligence, so what can it be?  Ah, white racism, that&rsquo;s gotta be it! And, umm, poor nutrition, that&rsquo;s gotta be another big factor.</p>
<p>We have to get busy and correct these root causes of black academic achievement deficits, just like we&rsquo;ve been doing for the past fifty years.  But we&rsquo;ll get it right this time, of that you can be sure, and send us two more boxcars of $100 bills while you&rsquo;re at it. </p>

		<p>Five principals of elementry schools in San Francisco are going to be fired because their schools are &#8220;underperforming&#8221;. All of the schools are majority black, and in the Hunters Point Ghet-toe,according to the local newspaper.Some black parents are supporting them.When will the educational establishment, here ans everywhere else, wake up and see why? Minnesotas students perform well because they are majority white, and likely a large percentage of them are Northern European.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the same old shell game, over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;minority students&#8221; = &#8220;at-risk students&#8221; = blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;lowest-performing schools&#8221; = schools with a lot of blacks.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Forest Hills Elementary School in Eden Prairie, which saw its reading scores jump and its achievement gap narrow on state tests last year.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always that long-promised Eldorado of some school, somewhere or other, where the magic formula was discovered and blacks miraculously caught up to Whites and proved all the Wicked Racists wrong.  It isn&rsquo;t until years later that we find no one can duplicate those shining results, or the test scores were fudged, or no records were kept.  And if it&rsquo;s reported at all, it&rsquo;s on page 43.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The gap between white and black fourth-graders hasn&rsquo;t narrowed since 1992, the first year data were available. The same is true of eighth-graders since 1998, the first year of available data for that grade.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that would have told them something, wouldn&rsquo;t you?  But no, only one outcome to the Noble Experiment is permissible, and White money will continue to be showered upon it until lead is transmuted into gold.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Dooher said the causes of the achievement gap are &ldquo;complex,&rdquo; with roots in socioeconomic issues.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not.  They&rsquo;re very simple and straightforward, with roots in genetic issues.  But <i>no</i> one is permitted to say so.<br>

<p>I believe we&rsquo;ve exhausted all socioeconomic excuses with failed theories and practices.</p>
<p>Blacks have consistently gotten everything they claimed was holding them back. Integrated schools. Free lunches/breakfasts. Black teachers. Black administrators. Black principals. Black school boards. Lead abatement. The list is endless.</p>
<p>Every theory has failed because the one fact that is never spoken in polite company is the relationship between race and intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not complex at all.</p>

		<p>I can take you to a school in the African bush where the only piece of school equipment is a blackboard, the school has neither door nor windows, merely a roof to keep out the rain and the English textbook is so old and tattered it was discarded by an English school a dozen years before. The teacher does not earn in a year what his American counterpart earns in a week, yet all his grade 8 students can read perfectly. If I could send a school board there for a week to learn and were they to learn, they would come home and save millions.</p>
<p>And here is that million dollar secret. The parents have to make a major sacrifice to send their children to school. They do so willingly because they know that only education is the key to escape a life of backbreaking labour. As there is no public education or healthcare, there is no pension, the only hope of surviving in old age is your children.Children are their pension fund, until something better comes along the birthrate is going to continue going through the roof. Reading is taught in grade one and two, if the kid does not learn it then, many do not, the parents are not going to waste their hard earned money, maybe the next kid will do better, into the fields with that one. I have never heard of it but it may well be that a kid survives to grade 8 and starts being disruptive. After being beaten black and blue by his teachers, his classmates will do so same but worse because that brute dared interrupt their learning and when he finally gets home he really gets it.</p>
<p>These kids not only learn the benefits and costs of education, but the ones not suitable are weeded out before they waste the time of the teachers and the rest of the class. That produces an education at a very small fraction of the cost.  That is also the only way this achievement gap is ever going to be closed.<br>
Accept the fact that some cannot be educated and spend the money on the rest.</p>

		<p>To poster 3, that&rsquo;s why the smartest (read: most experienced) teachers get out of such schools as fast as they can.  They will eventually be blamed for a problem that is beyond the power of any teacher to solve.  Then Arne Duncan et al will rail about the &#8220;bad&#8221; teachers and the entire school will be shut down and all the teachers fired.  </p>
<p>Then they will turn it over to some charter school operator who will exclude - in one way or another - the worst students and produce a few percentage points worth of results.  Along the way, they&rsquo;ll have 22 year old Teach for America (read modern do-gooder peace corp for our own exotic urban schools) &#8216;teachers&rsquo; who will work, like the movie Freedom Writers, all day, all night, weekends, and hang out with their students in social settings.  </p>
<p>This will go on until high teacher turnover and burnout forces the charter to hire more traditional teachers, who will not sacrifice their lives for pretend results (ever heard of project based learning, differentiation and exit portfolios?).  Then the teachers will unionize in the face of admin abuse and in the end, you&rsquo;re back to square one.  The urban youth never improved because their culture, that which matters most to them, told them that book learnin&rsquo; was a &#8216;white&rsquo; thing and therefore uncool.</p>

		<p>Right now I&rsquo;m glancing over at one of the NCAA basketball playoff games between Tennessee and Ohio State, with 10% of the players on the court now either black or mulatto - is this a coincidence? (Admittedly you can have a few exceptional teams now and then, like Brigham Young or Northern Iowa with majority white players, but if all the players who are starters of the 64 teams of March Madness are considered, I&rsquo;m sure the percentage of blacks or mulattoes would be about 85%)</p>
<p>What I want to say is that if there were people upset and tearing their hair out about the lack of white players, and no one admitted that inherited physical differences, on average, in running and jumping skills between blacks and whites is the prime factor in the numerical disparity, we could have also decades of effort involving time and money to close an uncloseable gap. Coaches who did not have results in narrowing the sports achievement gap would be fired, Physical Education Departments would concentrate on methodology classes in coaching to ensure that white players received special instruction, and all to no avail.</p>
<p>This similar situation is present in education where no one will admit that there are, on average, inherited differences in intellectual skills among different racial groups. It&rsquo;s as clear in this area as it is in a sport like basketball, but the consequences of admitting such unpleasant truths are far more negative for society. This is one reason why practically no voices in the Establishment media in the United States, or members of Congress for that matter, were concerned at all when the American Renaissance biannual conference was canceled by a group of intellectual hooligans. American Renaissance, and others of the same mind, are trying to hack away at quasi-religious falsehoods, and thereby are classified as heretics.</p>
<p>At this point we can only hope that the average European-American who has children, in a land where soon the youth of school age will be majority non-whites, will finally begin to see the truth behind the false premises of the &#8220;Education Racket,&#8221; and that could finally initiate a long awaited and effective counter-revolution. </p>

&#8220;State&rsquo;s black fourth-graders post worst reading scores in U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>How bad? Try a 9% proficiency rate in 4th AND 8th grade. In fact, non-English speakers did better than blacks.</p>

		<p>   I gave a placement reading test to a Baltimore, Maryland 9th grade class this semester. Of thirty students, only four were reading at or slightly above grade level. They are white. The remaining students are reading anywhere from 2.6 (second grade, sixth month) to 4 (entering fourth grade). They are black.<br>
   The ninth grade teachers are thrilled when they get students on the fourth grade reading level  &mdash;  they might actually get a chance to cover some of the mandated curriculum.</p>

Except for the fact that the U.S. is about $6 trillion broker and the White taxpayers are even more reviled and accused of being more racist than in the 1960&rsquo;s! Using Einstein&rsquo;s oft quoted dictum to judge this situation&hellip; we are truly insane! We continue to repeat the same process over and over again - each time expecting to get different results! But we never change anything! This is insanity!</p>

		<p>Once more.  After repeated requests.  Why don&rsquo;t these people reveal that there is an achievement gap between blacks and Hispanics?  Blacks and Asians?  Blacks and Indians?  Blacks and Middle Easterners?</p>
<p>Or, how about, blacks and everybody else?</p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re at it why don&rsquo;t they let everybody know that wealthy blacks are outperformed by all the poor in these  different races too, not just poor whites?</p>

<p>- -  I have to disagree.  When the powers that be have their way completely there won&rsquo;t be any more White race due to miscegenation and low birth rate.  Then there won&rsquo;t be any more racial disparity.  Furthermore, miscegenation will bring up the Black IQ;  you know, when a Black man and White woman ahem, get it on, and the offspring are half-White, half-black, they always consider themselves Black.  When their IQ is higher due to miscegenation they always attribute it to their being Black.  This is the end result that the powers that be want.<br>

I would just like to add  &mdash;  the money wasted on trying to close the racial achievement gap could have been spent on OUR kids. I pay taxes, the parents of the lagging kids don&rsquo;t  &mdash;  why should their kids receive all the attention, and mine none?</p>

<p>Troubled, inner-city schools are simply a no-win situation for White teachers.  We are reviled on one hand for &#8216;not understanding black culture&rsquo;, not being &#8216;role models for non-Whites&rsquo;, and &#8216;not looking like&rsquo; the students we teach. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the black community understands that the best, most experienced teachers are traditional, highly-educated Whites  &mdash;  and demand that White teachers be forced back into black schools that are marked by high turn-over, scores of inexperienced Teach for America types that are gone by Christmas, a plethora of revolving substitutes (many of whom either leave by third period or, if they make it to the end of the day, vow never to return), un-credentialed interns from a lame program, and &#8216;lemon&rsquo; teachers that have been passed around for years.</p>
<p>My teachers union, fortunately, has fought mandatory White teacher transfers to black schools for decades  &mdash;  one of the few union platforms with which I agree. </p>
<p>You also write:<br>
   <br>
&#8220;..Then they will turn it over to some charter school operator who will exclude - in one way or another - the worst students </p>
<p>This will go on until high teacher turnover and burnout forces the charter to hire more traditional teachers (ever heard of project based learning, differentiation and exit portfolios?)&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I have seen these phony programs come and go for decades now  &mdash;  all of them utter disasters, wasting trillions of dollars and time, all depressingly doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Many of these fad theories are hatched at universities, in ivory towers, by those who have never set foot in a low-achieving black/hispanic school (and would never deign to).    </p>
<p>There have been so many of these fix-its since the 60s that the &#8216;new&rsquo; ones are merely recycled old ones, tweaked a bit, given a new name, the same promises made to &#8216;finally close the gap&rsquo; and fully funded by the government with trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>Education will never be improved by educational fads  &mdash;  all of them are fated to self-destruct.  But then, maybe that is the idea.</p>
<p>I well know of project-based learning, differentiation and portfolios  &mdash;  and how they all, in turn, eventually failed.</p>
<p>I also remember the self-esteem movement (that was guaranteed to raise black/hispanic test scores by making them feel good about themselves), &#8216;whole&rsquo; language where reading was learned by osmosis, Gardener&rsquo;s (ugh!) multiple intelligences (each kid has one of the seven intelligences, all of which are equal), cooperative learning (group work, the smart kid does all the work, the others copy or do nothing and all receive the exact same grade), Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy (all learning must be at the &#8216;highest level&rsquo; where a student with a second-grade reading level is supposed to &#8216;critique, discriminate, evaluate, and interpret&rsquo; what he reads) and outcome-based learning (where the suggested final grade was &#8220;L&#8221; for learning).</p>
<p>These programs would be laughable if the educational establishment weren&rsquo;t so serious about implementing them nation-wide on every child regardless of ability and the government didn&rsquo;t spend trillions of dollars on what we more aware teachers know from the onset will fail miserably.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat through hours of worthless training for these worthless programs, catalogued thousands of brand new textbooks (only to be told to get rid of them at the end of the year because a new program was being implemented) and watched as each one of them, one after the other, was proved to be a failure. </p>
<p>It is depressing to say the least and as the more experienced teachers retire and are replaced by lesser-quality &#8216;teachers of color&rsquo; the gap will only widen (as these new teachers won&rsquo;t be able to give the kids the answers to the state tests as they don&rsquo;t know the answers themselves).</p>

		<p>Are you going to believe 40 years worth of data and common sense or are you going to believe the social scienetists who say it&rsquo;s because of poverty.  Well poverty has alaways been blamed for  crime and low educational achievement whenever blacks fail. However i&rsquo;d like to point out that if poverty produces crime and low educational achievement then nothing great would have happened in this country after the Great Depression because by virtue of the mass poverty we would have all killed each other or at the very least none of us would have finished High School and we would have become a nation of lazy under-achievers.</p>

		<p>The reason this disparity exists is because educators are analyzing the statistics based on race. Sorting the data along racial lines and then comparing averages based on skin color tones, I thought, would be evil in any Liberal&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>However, the only method of extorting taxpayer dollars is to demand &#8220;further research&#8221; into the matter, only attainable by determining the racially disparate impacts of our education system. So, it becomes convenient for them to become race profilers in this case.</p>
<p>On a side note, roving gangs of blacks running through the streets of America&rsquo;s cities will be at an all-time high this year. Drive anywhere in Mpls or St. Paul and you will be simply alarmed at the numbers, and we haven&rsquo;t even seen April yet. </p>
<p>Edina&rsquo;s Southdale mall, which was once a haven for yuppies of the highest order, is now an African wasteland. The employees are mostly black, some with shades of purple even. And unless you are with an attractive female, you will get stares of hatred that practically trigger the fight-flight mechanism.</p>

<p>In a multicultural society, the end result of this is that the best students are not challenged nearly enough because the academic standards and requirements are lowered to accommodate the weak (e.g., Blacks).</p>

		<p>People should be asking: it&rsquo;s been twenty years (actually much longer) and the leftists have tried just about everything to close the black/white achievement gap but nothing has worked.  At what point do we confront Mr. Seagren and place the burden of proof on him that this gap is NOT due to genetics.  I think we are way past that point now.  The simplest explanation is genetics so I demand that Mr. Seagren, and his ilk, prove otherwise or stop wasting our money.</p>

		<p>Once again, Minnesota takes the lead for self-flagellation due to the lack of intelligence and industriousness with its minority population. If by some miracle, MLK high school in downtown Minneapolis were to beat Paul Bunyan HS in Swedish Chef, MN in some academic contest, we would never hear the end of it. If this were Vegas, my money is still on the farm kids from the boondocks who receive 1/10th of the funding that the &#8220;under performing minority&#8221; kids will get. There are some distant ancestors of mine who are from Norway, but I wonder what it is with people of Scandinavian ancestry bending over backwards to accommodate failure. This was never a slave state. Even fifteen years ago, Chris Rock joked that &#8220;the only blacks in Minnesota are Prince and Kirby Puckett&#8221;. I&rsquo;m guessing that if I visited parts of Minneapolis/St. Paul now, it would look like Detroit. </p>
<p>&#8220;The state&rsquo;s persistent, vexing achievement gap has become a long-term blemish on an otherwise good reputation for educational performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is only a vexing problem for those who are hell-bent on making unequal things equal. My high school was 75% black and I didn&rsquo;t even think to go out for any sports. We had 2 white players on our football team, the QB and Kicker/Punter. Yours truly did not demand accommodation for lack of size, speed, or firepower. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I interviewed for a position in Billings, Montana. While I did not get the job, I thought that Billings was a fairly charming town and I would love the opportunity to visit again. I make it a point to read their local newspaper (The Billings Gazette) online and this morning (03/28), they had a story about the state spelling bee championships. Granted, this is Montana, but almost every one of those kids were white and I didn&rsquo;t see a picture of one that was in 8th grade and tipping the scales at 300 lbs. Change the clothing and the hairstyles and these kids could have easily been dropped into the pictures taken in front of their grandparents schools. Give DC enough time and these kids will be targeted for destruction. </p>
<p>Billings is not without a minority community. There aren&rsquo;t many blacks, but there is a Crow Indian reservation about 30 miles down the road. While there, I was told that the Billings Police Department runs a &#8220;drunk bus&#8221; on weekends, government paydays, etc., to round up all of the passed out Indians floating around town. They are then carted off to the drunk tank and arrangements are made for the tribal officials to pick up their members and return them to the reservation. </p>
<p>I wonder if we will all end up segregating along not just color lines, but also levels of accomplishment. This seems to be the natural outcome.</p>

		<p>Some black students may not have the intelligence or work ethic of white students, but they have something even better to get them through the tough times:  Racism.</p>
<p>I was accused by a failing black student of being a racist last week because he earned a 58% for the 9-weeks while the class average for the white students was 81%. This is a Pre-algebra class by the way.</p>
<p>I documented the racist accusation with the principal and gave the kid a &#8220;F&#8221; like he deserved.  Thank goodness I teach in a 97% white rural district where white teachers do not have to cave into every demand by black parents and students.</p>
<p>Note the 23 percentage point difference between the black student and the rest of the white class. This is pretty much normal from what I have seen in my time in education, and it saddens me greatly to know that this black student will be first in line for college admissions and for whatever will pass for a job in this county 8 years from now.</p>

<p>I encountered an article in a Montana newspaper a few days ago.  A professional gang-banger with a Hispanic name was given an 87-month bid in Federal prison for a felon-in-possession rap.  (I think Michael C. Scott calls it &#8220;doing life on the installment plan.&#8221;)  At the end of the article, his lawyer&rsquo;s argument for a shorter sentence was that his client &#8220;grew up on the gang-infested mean streets of south Billings.&#8221; </p>
<p>Billings?</p>
<p>Not even in Montana can you get away from the mess.  I looked it up, and Billings has had a surprising population growth from 2000 to 2008, pushing it from 89,000 in 2000 to about 103,000 in 2008, Montana&rsquo;s first six-figure city.  I&rsquo;m guessing that most of that growth is Hispanic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing with what you are saying, and I could easily see that Billings population spike is due to an influx of Hispanics. Probably more Hispanics than people moving out of the sticks and those relocating from liberal high tax states. The few locals I spoke with pretty much to a person said to avoid the south side like the plague. Buy a house in the heights or west Billings, but don&rsquo;t go south of the RR tracks and stay clear of the area by North Park. </p>

		<p>The whiter the State or the school, the more glaring is the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s mathematical.  If you have a school with 85% or more whites, and 15% or less blacks, the whites AREN&rsquo;T held back, and the blacks can&rsquo;t keep up.  At some point, given enough blacks in the school, curriculum is dumbed down, white enthusiasm and work ethic is destroyed, and more whites begin acting out like blacks including in scholastic disruption.  Then the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; isn&rsquo;t as glaringly large.  So really, those schools with the least achievement gap have the least overall scholastic aptitude.<br>
Sure, the gap between blacks and whites is smaller, but the gap between the school&rsquo;s overall achievement and the national norm is bigger.  As everyone has said:  there IS NO fixing the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;.  The only solution is to accept the real reasons for it, and re-segregate.  IF as the civil rights hustlers state, integration will raise black scholastic achievement, why is it that blacks in the whitest schools are the segment whose achievement is the MOST dismal in comparison??????</p>

		<p>Africa is not Europe for a reason. Black output is not White output for a reason. Forever, blacks have been associated with things fleshly, physical and rythmic. Different cultures and sub races are different, not the same. If we in the modern world truly aspire to be just, we must allow nature to take its course. The US constitutional verity that all citizens have the right to pursue their destiny unhindered&hellip; does not demand that the high achievers be hindered from their full potential by having their earned income syphoned off via taxes and applied to others of low achievement. In fact a great deal of black people have profited immensely in the United States and other White nations due to the much higher standards of living the White races have created by comparison to the Black race or other races to a lesser degree. To me, the greatest damage done in this issue of race between Black and White is what I perceive to be an imbalanced view, indulging too much pity for Blacks, not taking account they were prostituted to the world by their own race. Thus Blacks sleep in the bed they made (collectively).. no less than  Whites in purchasing them have suffered (collectively)* No individual or group of individuals on earth ever had an easy life. Life always has hard parts for all,this is axiomatic. Any non Whites living in nations created by Whites have every right to leave and return to the society&rsquo;s created by their own racial type, with very few Whites protesting.</p>

<p>Why does ultra-liberal Minnesota have a racial gap as regards white-Bantu test scores? In that regard, Minnesota is no better than Mississippi, is it? I thought liberals liked to go around saying they had all the answers, because they understood the problems. Then, why the gap?</p>
<p>All along, I though Bantus from places like Mississippi migrated to places like Minnesota in order to go to &#8220;better schools&#8221;. So why is still there a racial gap in schlolastic performance in Minnesota? Or California? Or New York?</p>

		<p>#14 C, another poster on an earlier forum here suggested that Whites could collectivly pay proper teachers and in that manner, we Whites could control who the students were and the curriculum. My sons are grown now and had the good fortune to go to schools with few if any, blacks. I do think that maybe paying a (or some) qualified and competent White teachers &#8220;under the table&#8221; so to speak may be the way to go in the near future for parents with smaller children. Though I have no school age children now, I would still be willing to help with that.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; would be appropriate if all of the races were of equal intelligence.  However, decades of testing have proven that they are not.  What we&rsquo;re seeing here is an IQ gap.  No amount of funds, programs or political correctness can change this plain and simple fact.  </p>
<p>If there is any injustice concerning this, it lies in the fact that we have told the races that we are all the same.  The blacks actually believe that their intelligence is on parity with others.  It is no wonder that they have concluded that their collective failures must be the fault of someone else.          </p>
