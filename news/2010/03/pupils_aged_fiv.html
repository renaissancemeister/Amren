			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan Kisiel and Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Heads will be forced to list children as young as five on school &#8216;hate registers&rsquo; over everyday playground insults.</p>
<p>Even minor incidents must be recorded as examples of serious bullying and details kept on a database until the pupil leaves secondary school.</p>
<p>Teachers are to be told that even if a primary school child uses homophobic or racist words without knowing their meaning, simply teaching them such words are hurtful and inappropriate is not enough.</p>
<p>Instead the incident has to be recorded and his or her behaviour monitored for future signs of &#8216;hate&rsquo; bullying.</p>
<p>The accusations will also be recorded in databases held by councils and made available to Whitehall and ministers to help them devise future anti-bullying campaigns.</p>
<p>The scale of the effort to stop children using homophobic or racist language was revealed after the parents of a ten-year-old primary school pupil in Somerset, Peter Drury, were told that his name would be put on a register and his behaviour monitored while he remained at school.</p>
<p>The boy was reported after he called a friend &#8216;gay boy&rsquo;. His parents fear the record of homophobic bullying will count against him throughout his school career and even into adulthood.</p>
<p>In another incident last year a six-year-old girl, Sharona Gower, was reported for &#8216;racist bullying&rsquo; at her school near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.</p>
<p>Sharona was chased by two 11-year-old girls, one of whom taunted her that she had chocolate on her face.</p>
<p>The six-year-old responded to one of the girls, who was black: &#8216;Well, you&rsquo;ve got chocolate on yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many schools nationwide have already followed advice that they should record incidents of alleged racist, homophobic or anti-disability bullying.</p>
<p>One report last year by the Manifesto Club civil liberties think-tank said that 40,000 children each year are having racist charges added to their school records.</p>
<p>But ministers aim to make reporting of supposed &#8216;hate taunting&rsquo; a legal requirement for every school, primary as well as secondary, and every local authority across the country from the beginning of the new school year in September.</p>
<p>Incidents considered serious will have to be reported to local authorities. Children&rsquo;s Secretary Ed Balls is set to introduce rules that, officials said, &#8216;will mean that schools will have to record and report serious or recurring incidents of bullying to their local authority.</p>
<p>&#8216;This will include incidents of bullying and racism between pupils and abuse or bullying of school staff.</p>
<p>The Government is clear that schools must take seriously any complaints made of abuse or bullying by pupils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Schools will be expected to monitor the behaviour of individual children. Local authority records will show incidents and their nature, but not names of pupils.</p>
<p>Head teachers were first advised to keep records of racist incidents eight years ago.</p>
<p>Then, in 2007, heads were told to include disability-related and homophobic bullying in their tallies.</p>
<p>Rules for heads say that using language such as &#8216;gay&rsquo;  &mdash;  which has had near-universal usage among British schoolchildren in recent years to denote something as inferior  &mdash;  counts as homophobic bullying, even if pupils do not have any homophobic intention in mind when using the word.</p>
<p>Primary school pupils must be taught &#8216;the nature and consequences of homophobic bullying&rsquo;, according to the rules.</p>
<p>Schools Minister Vernon Coaker said: &#8216;The majority of schools already record incidents of bullying.</p>
<p>&#8216;However, we want to make sure that all schools have measures in place to prevent and tackle bullying and show they are taking it seriously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But concerns have been raised that the system turns everyday banter among children into incidents of racism or homophobia when none was meant.</p>
<p>Margaret Morrissey, founder of campaign group Parents Outloud, said: &#8216;This is totally appalling. The use of such language is part of the learning process. Children need to learn where the boundaries lie. And I very much doubt they understand what they are saying.</p>
<p>&#8216;This does not mean that the behaviour shouldn&rsquo;t be challenged. It must be explained that it is wrong. But to keep a register that will haunt them for years to come is going far too far and is against all rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michele Elliott of the charity Kidscape said: &#8216;Children are being criminalised and singled out here from a very early age when they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tory MP Ann Widdecombe said: &#8216;Abuse in the playground has always happened and always will.</p>
<p>&#8216;Children have to learn to take this as part of growing up and you can&rsquo;t punish children for doing something they don&rsquo;t understand while they are very young.&rsquo;</p>
<p>HOW PETER DRURY WAS &#8216;HATE LISTED&rsquo;</p>
<p>Penny Drury was furious when her ten-year-old son Peter was put on the local education authority&rsquo;s &#8216;hate list&rsquo; after he called a friend a &#8216;gay boy&rsquo; outside school.</p>
<p>Mrs Drury, 43, was called into her son&rsquo;s primary school to be told by the headmaster that another mother had heard Peter using homophobic language.</p>
<p>She was told that the incident would be registered and his file monitored while he was at Ashcombe Primary School in Westonsuper-Mare, Somerset.</p>
<p>&#8216;He doesn&rsquo;t even understand about the birds and the bees, so how can he be homophobic?&rsquo; said Mrs Drury, pictured with Peter. Minor incidents must be recorded as examples of serious bullying and details kept on a database</p>
<p>&#8216;Peter is a very naive boy who didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing and is now very upset as he is now in trouble. It doesn&rsquo;t mean he is going to turn into a homophobic attacker when he is older.</p>
<p>&#8216;He must have picked up the word from somewhere and thought it to mean stupid.</p>
<p>&#8216;If I heard it I would have been the first to correct him and tell him not to use it, but putting him on a register seems way over the top.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Drury and her husband Brian, a manufacturing manager, asked for Peter to be removed from the register but to no avail.</p>
<p>Mrs Drury added: &#8216;I&rsquo;m now worried if this is going to affect him applying for universities in the future. I just think the whole thing would be better sorted out by the teacher or parent explaining to them that their language is wrong and not to do it again.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>I have an alternate explanation.  They&rsquo;re children or young people.  By their nature, they&rsquo;re mean and cruel.  San Francisco just started a program to reduce &#8220;homophobic bullying&#8221; in schools, because fifth graders were exchanging what some would think of as homophobic slurs.  Of course, nobody stopped to consider that they&rsquo;re fifth graders; that&rsquo;s what they do.  I must have been the only fifth grader in the history of the fifth grade not to use those words.  Then again, I was too busy arguing for a world free of nuclear weapons, a fantasy I disposed of by the next school year.</p>

		<p>The Anglo-Sphere has gone mad.  I remember my youngest sister using the term &#8220;that is so gay&#8221; in the 1980s while in grammar school to indicate something that in my day would have been referred to as lame.  It had nothing to do with anything anti-gay.  Now even the youngest (white) child will be tracked throughout life as a &#8220;hater&#8221; for any simple slip of the tongue.  This is thought control starting at it&rsquo;s earliest.  Now why don&rsquo;t they hook up a tiny microphone to each child.  Whenever they say a naughty word an implanted chip would give them a shock.  </p>
<p>What happened to &#8220;sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me&#8221;?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing. England changed from a white, western global empire into a bankrupt, multicultural, neo-Marxist, Orwellian surveillance state in less than a century. That&rsquo;s a blink of an eye in historical terms  &mdash;  a truly apocalyptic case of decline and fall comparable (speedwise) to the sudden collapse of the classic Maya civilization, which also vanished in something like a century. England  &mdash;  what&rsquo;s left of it, anyway  &mdash;  is about twenty years ahead of us, I think. Their decline got started for real around 1945 and the US didn&rsquo;t start to really fall apart until the mid to late Sixties, but everything that&rsquo;s happening there is happening here in one way or another. We&rsquo;re living through a period of widespread social collapse in the west and the speed at which it&rsquo;s happening is truly mind-boggling.</p>

		<p>This is unbelievable. Children who are legally incapable of consent or the ability to even understand abstractions such as racial or sexual hate are now being listed in some database as potential racists?  Orwell was absolutely right! </p>
<p>And to think up till about 80 years ago, the UK ran the world. Oh how the mighty have fallen! </p>

		<p>I was in London as a part of a quick European tour in 1999 and I thought, at the time, I would like to live and work there.  However, with what I&rsquo;ve learned since about the liberal madness of the UK, wouldn&rsquo;t want to now. You can&rsquo;t even defend yourself from attack there without being in greater trouble than the attacker. And this garbage about branding young schoolchildren homophobic and racist, well, what else is to be expected from the island lunatic asylum known as the UK? An article some time back had white children there as young as four years old being labeled &#8220;racist&#8221; if they didn&rsquo;t want to play with a black kid.</p>
<p>The UK has surely gone mad, at least amongst its &#8220;rulers&#8221;.</p>

		<p> This story shows conclusively that the Labor government in Britain is now securely ensconced in the loony bin. Doesn&rsquo;t a national government have anything better to do than to monitor what 6-year-old kids call each other on playgrounds?!</p>
<p> What on earth has happened to our Western Civilization? I hope someone in the Mulatto Messiah&rsquo;s administration didn&rsquo;t read this story; it may give them more crazy ideas than they&rsquo;ve already evidenced.</p>

		<p>Re-education camps will be next.  When that doesn&rsquo;t eliminate entirely heinous crimes  as committed by this little cold hearted monster, England can begin filling the &#8220;killing fields&#8221; with all those who refuse to become politically correct automatons.  They will import some marxist Laotians to head up the new program.  Or have they imported them already?  Woe is England, that bright star which beamed common law rights and parliamentarian democracy throughout the world has now become Animal Farm in REALITY.  It&rsquo;s no longer fiction.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the entire population of the U.K. has gone mad, it&rsquo;s just that the Marxist brigades have the initiative, and the more sober-minded Brits are mired in politeness, stiff upper lipness, and a reluctance to speak their minds to these new elites.</p>
<p>At the moment the Marxists may seem all powerful, but their house is made of straw.  Hard times makes ordinary people mean. You can&rsquo;t placate empty stomachs with leftist rhetoric. </p>

		<p>You can bet kids of color harass and mock whites at all time high levels. As long as &#8216;hate&rsquo; is considered white, and the nation doubles it&rsquo;s efforts to stamp out hate, you can bet this will be so. If England is anything like the USA, the more non-whites harass, assault and even murder whites, the more the authorities and media will move against &#8216;hate&rsquo; seemingly for the whole purpose of covering it up. </p>

		<p>It all started, he says, after he went to see a Nigerian horror film about zombies. &ldquo;In this movie one person was raising the dead with a stick. I was with a friend and we went to a cemetery to play and try and act out the movie,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But when my friend saw me doing this he ran away and accused me of being a sorcerer to his parents.&rdquo; Jean goes on to tell me that his friend&rsquo;s parents came to his grandparents house where he was living and told them that he was a sorcerer and would have to be burned. Then, he says, his grandparents gave him a beating before taking him down to the offices of the local authority. <br>
&ldquo;The head of the authority beat me with a stick and told me to say that I was a sorcerer. He forced me to say it. People were waiting outside to kill me,&rdquo; he says. Jean was then brought before a local priest who confirmed that he was a sorcerer.</p>
