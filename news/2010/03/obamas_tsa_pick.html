<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=127285">Obama&rsquo;s TSA Pick: Hire on &#8216;Ethnic Diversity&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Klein, WorldNetDaily, March 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s pick to head the Transportation Security Administration long has pushed for &#8220;ethnic diversity&#8221; as a determining factor in hiring new teams for U.S. military and intelligence agencies, WND has learned.</p>
<p>The president announced today his nominee for TSA chief, retired Gen. Robert Harding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has lobbied for &#8220;ethnic diversity&#8221; in the U.S. defense establishment.</p>
<p>WND found that in 2003, Harding submitted written testimony to a Senate subcommittee hearing on intelligence issues pushing for more diversity at security agencies, going so far as to call diversity a &#8220;requirement.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Working with larger defense contractors, I find that bringing in multicultural talent remains challenging, especially on classified contracts,&#8221; Harding wrote.</p>
<p>Harding noted how he previously testified in Senate hearings while working at the Defense Department. He then applauded the senatorial committee for remaining &#8220;steadfastly clear about the need for diversity in the ranks of the CIA.&#8221;</p>
<p>He urged the Defense Department to &#8220;build systems and incentives to attract, maintain and sustain a diverse group of gifted (human intelligence) operatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harding maintained the military community &#8220;still needs senior folks with language and diversity at the top  &mdash;  folks who feel a responsibility in a particularly focused way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harding declared &#8220;selection must be made at the senior levels!&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;[There are] many ways to do that, but if legislation is needed maybe it should be part of the discussion here.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harding, meanwhile, would not be the only Obama administration official with controversial views on diversity.</p>
<p>WND reported President Obama&rsquo;s counter-terrorism advisor, John Brennan, last month stated the White House is working to calibrate policies in the fight against terrorism that ensure Americans are &#8220;never&#8221; profiled.</p>
<p>Speaking at a question-and-answer session for Muslim law students at New York University, Brennan declared himself a &#8220;citizen of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting was facilitated by the Islamic Society of North America, a radical Muslim group that was an unindicted co-conspirator in a scheme to raise money for Hamas.<br>

		<p>Being a citizen of the world means identifying with all the non whites that make up the 92% of global population.  It&rsquo;s a race war carried on at the highest levels of political philosophy and policy.</p>

<p>Okay, let the world pay your salary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to seem him go to China and demand that their security apparatus becomes more racially diverse, all the while touting his global citizenship.</p>
<p>One more thing:  There can&rsquo;t be a &#8220;citizen&#8221; of the world because there&rsquo;s no world government to grant citizenship.  Those who say they are are only implicitly and subconsciously expressing their desire for world government.</p>

		<p>I took one look at this new TSA chief and knew he was hung up on race, as most mulattos are.  This entire jobs program could be shut down tommorrow and the travelling public would be no less safe than they are today, as this &#8220;security&#8221; is a form of theater and nothing else.  </p>

		<p>The thing is, there&rsquo;s no way to hire more blacks without lowering the standards. Hence, the standards will be lowered (at least for minorities). Another one of the blessings of diversity.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of the term &#8220;citizen of the world&#8221;. It&rsquo;s one that I seldom here anyone but Americans describe themselves as. No, you are a citizen of whatever country you are from. Yes, you are a human being like the rest of the world but not a &#8220;citizen&#8221; of it.</p>

		<p>Sometimes, &#8220;diversity&#8221; can be a blessing - such as when you want to smuggle beverages into the airport and you luck out because the &#8220;diverse&#8221; TSA workers are too incompetent to identify &#8220;contraband&#8221; in your carry-on luggage.</p>

How can you have a General who has no allegiance to the country he is supposed to defend?  A statement like that would be considered treasonous in any sane society.</p>

Is this supposed to be funny?  We&rsquo;re at war with the muslim world, and this guy finds it a challenge to hire muslims.  And how can he expect other foreigners to have any respect for America when he doesn&rsquo;t even consider himself a citizen of the USA.</p>

		<p>We already know how well &#8220;diversity&#8221; is working&hellip;.it&rsquo;s NOT! Maj.Hasan in Ft. Hood was/is a classic case of what to expect of recruiting muslims into the military or intelligence community. It has been said that military intelligence is an oxymoron! well, this course of action would certainly prove it.</p>

		<p>The good general is going to have problems trying to fill the CIA and defense agencies that require security clearances with minorities.  Those positions require no notice lie detector tests and random drug testing.  They also require NO felony arrests on your record, period.  Good luck finding blacks who fit those criteria successfully.</p>

		<p>Diversity sounds all well and good on the surface, but if you need spies to go into Russia or infiltrate an organization in Syria, then African American or Latino agents might stick out.  On the flip side, we don&rsquo;t have to many intelligence ops outside of Europe, Asia or the Middle East.  How would black or Latino agents fit in?  I guess our enemies need to have their racial tolerance raised for that to happen!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that, after all the criticism, Obama continues to appoint controversial people to high positions.  He can&rsquo;t be that dumb or obtuse, so I can only conclude that he is trying to stick it to whitey.</p>

		<p>To Bill above:  I agree but like everything else, the rules will change to accommodate hiring more blacks and non-whites.  The felony convictions will be expunged.</p>

<p>Good point.  Those positions require no notice lie detector tests and random drug testing. They also require NO felony arrests on your record, period.</p>
<p>However, if need be, those criteria would certainly be waived in order to meet the desired numbers.  As crazy as that sounds diversity trumps any form of common sense or in this case national security.</p>

		<p>Well, when you allow your nation to be invaded, when you allow yourself to become a hated minority in your own homeland, you have to expect that the new owners will replace you at the top.  There has been this great myth among ordinary (non-InsaneLiberal)white Americans, particularly Conservatives,  that their displacement won&rsquo;t be bad because the leadership will remain white and competent  (with maybe a little token number of non-whites) for a long time to come.   They&rsquo;ve bought peace for themselves by passing a cultural deficit on to their children.  Obama is just the beginning of the beginning of the displacement of whites in power in this country,  whites are still a majority and there is a limit to how far they can now go.   These whites are in for a rude shock.  The system will collapse on an exponential curve once political power is permanently passed to a non-white/Leftist power structure.   Countries around the world are already beginning to adjust their foreign policies to the reality of third-world post-America America.</p>

		<p>11 Bill:</p>
<p>Because many big city police departments are under pressure to hire blacks, many now have disposed of their previous standards of not hiring those with misdemeanor records, or felony arrests (but no felony conviction), or even those with a juvenile system felony conviction.  The only line not breached yet is letting adult felons be cops.  BUT&hellip;Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser has proposed that KC breach that line; however, I don&rsquo;t think he meant it seriously, he wants to propose a ridiculously obtuse thing in order not to be bargained down out of his comfort zone, that is, as much affirmative action as possible for the KCPD.  Ironically, Funkhouser is white, and was able to sneak in as Mayor because a lot of credible blacks divided up the black vote.  </p>
<p>I suspect many Federal &#8220;security&#8221; agencies, including the CIA, will soon be accepting adult felons in order to have more diversity.</p>
