<h1>Que. Government Forced Woman From Classroom for Refusing to Remove Face Covering</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Montpetit, The Canadian Press, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After months of balancing a woman&rsquo;s religious beliefs with her desire to learn French, the Quebec government stepped into her classroom to offer an ultimatum: take off the niqab or drop the course.</p>
<p>The woman opted to keep her Islamic face-covering and has filed a human-rights complaint against the government.</p>
<p>In a province where the government frequently faces accusations of doing too much to accommodate minorities, these actions have prompted a fair bit of praise.</p>
<p>The woman began taking a French course designed for immigrants at a Montreal college in February but she refused to remove her niqab while men were present.</p>
<p>The college was initially willing to accommodate her, but eventually balked as her demands escalated.</p>
<p>According to a report in a Montreal newspaper, she was allowed to give an oral with her back to the class and asked men to move so they wouldn&rsquo;t face each other.</p>
<p>The breaking point occurred when the woman again refused to take off the niqab, though teachers had stressed it was essential they see her face to correct her enunciation and facial expressions.</p>
<p>In what appears to be a highly unusual move, provincial Immigration Minister Yolande James intervened. Officials from her department, acting with the minister&rsquo;s knowledge, met with the woman to discuss her options.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has specific pedagogical objectives in its French courses,&#8221; said James&rsquo;s spokesman, Luc Fortin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&rsquo;t accept that these objectives, or the learning environment in the class, be compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several groups, including several teachers&rsquo; unions, applauded the government for drawing a line in the sand. So did moderate Muslim groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people come to Canada we&rsquo;re not coming to the Islamic Republic of Canada,&#8221; said Raheel Raza, a Muslim women&rsquo;s-rights activist who has argued for a public ban on religious face coverings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming here because we want that freedom, we want the separation of church and state.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one Muslim group disagreed.</p>
<p>The Canadian Muslim Forum, which claimed the woman was intimidated by other members of her class, said the move amounts to a misreading of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Quebec people have the right to wear what they want,&#8221; said spokeswoman Kathy Malas.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a question of reasonable accommodation at all. She was complaining about how she was being treated by other males in the class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s name is being withheld for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>The question of whether to accommodate religious or ethnic minorities, and if so how much, has simmered beneath the surface of Quebec politics for several years.</p>
<p>When tensions erupted in 2007 over a series of highly publicized controversies, the government commissioned a $5-million study to quell the matter.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks the so-called reasonable-accommodation debate has vaulted back into the headlines, much to the dismay of those who helped prepare the commission&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>Since its release in 2008, they note, the Liberal government has failed to implement most of its recommendations.</p>
<p>In fact, critics have accused the Charest government of altogether avoiding any discussion of awkward, identity-based issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government is paying the price for its passivity,&#8221; said Jocelyn Maclure, a philosophy professor at the Universite de Laval who served as a consultant on the Bouchard-Taylor commission.</p>
<p>The commission&rsquo;s suggestions included creating a public body to provide training on accommodations, and better informing immigrant women about Quebec cultural norms.</p>
<p>But others warned of the danger of reading too much into what is essentially an isolated case.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not like behind this woman there are 2,000 other niqab-wearing women who are about to make similar kinds of demands,&#8221; said Daniel Weinstock, who, like Maclure, was a consultant to Bouchard-Taylor.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cases don&rsquo;t reflect the reality of what&rsquo;s going on out there. For every one case like this, which is problematic, there are a hundred that are dealt with in a very reasonable manner.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>This is just another example of White marxist schizophrenia.  Why is the government involved with someone taking a class in French?  Why is the government concerned with what someone is wearing?  The government should keep Muslims out of Quebec because they are not compatible with the native (I mean French, not Indian) population.  </p>

		<p>Actually Flamethrower, Muslims are not compatible with any other people who will not claim Allah as their savior, no matter what country of origin that they may be from. Most Indians, in fact, hate Muslims too. It&rsquo;s because of the arrogant upbringing which alot of American blacks have. You make it (whites) and we take it (blacks). If you look at an Atlas, the majority of Muslims live around India and China, but not in those countries. There&rsquo;s a reason for that. They are not very productive to businesses because they (1) don&rsquo;t like to do physical labor and (2) pray 100 times a day which interferes with production and (3) choose usually not to communicate with el-kitabh (non-Muslims) in the work place. So they just don&rsquo;t carry the load in comparison to what they want the native population (white Christians mostly, or Jews) to carry for them.</p>

<p><br/>
No, there certainly <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> &#8220;2,000 others.&#8221; I believe the Muslim population of Canada is now up to around 800,000 (in a nation of only 33M, or one-tenth the size of US). </p>
<p>We can assume half of those 800,000 Muslims currently in Canada are women: 400,000.</p>
<p>And of those 400,000 Muslim females, let&rsquo;s say only the most religious 10% are the ones wearing the niqab (or &#8220;burqa&#8221; or &#8220;hijab&#8221; or &#8220;chador&#8221; or whatever it is they&rsquo;re calling their women&rsquo;s HazMat suits this week), which leaves 40,000. </p>
<p>So no, Monsieur Weinstock, it&rsquo;s not at all like behind this woman there are 2,000 other niqab-wearing women who are about to make similar kinds of demands&hellip; it&rsquo;s more like there are FORTY THOUSAND of them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to wager that a great many of these 40,000 veiled Brides of Mohammed are far less interested in learning your French than they are in making YOU learn THEIR languages and THEIR customs. </p>

		<p>If this woman wants to live as a Sharia muslim then she would not be allowed in the same class as men NOR WOULD SHE EVEN BE ALLOWED IN A SCHOOL! Stupid American black converts to muslim pick and choose those tenents of the muslim ideaology which are most likely to aid in their ghetto lottery attempt BUT, the females simply don&rsquo;t realize what they are asking for when they cry for Sharia laws&hellip;ask Saudi women how that works out, they can&rsquo;t drive, leave the house without a male RELATIVE with her, cannot be in a vehicle with a male not a RELATIVE, cannot leave the country without a male RELATIVE with her OR written permission from said relative who is required to escort her to the aircraft gate, a divorce by a husband is as simple as saying an Arabic word 3 times and it&rsquo;s done with no further financial obligation to the now divorced wife (many young under 25 divorcees with 3 or more children in Saudi) AND! they can be forced to marry men NOT of their choosing. Afghanistan will be worse.</p>

		<p>Any country that has a Moslem majority is a drag on the modern world.  The national productivity is cut in half because women are so restricted, and men are encouraged to remain in the position in which Allah placed them.  Thus, such societies are Medieval and stagnant.  <br/>
Whites appear to be finally awakening to the real threat of those with non-Western values.  Cultural liberality has had its half century in the sun.  </p>

		<p>This has yet to affect me but I know exactly what I would do and it would not be to protest directly. However, I would gather a few White male participants and attend classes with us all wearing full length burkas and niqabs with only the eyes showing. Of course we would only wear boxer shorts underneath in case we were asked to remove any &#8216;offending&rsquo; clothing. Then await any objections, after all&hellip;&ldquo;In Quebec people have the right to wear what they want,&rdquo; said spokeswoman Kathy Malas&hellip;.</p>

		<p>They would have to expel me from the class, as I would absolutely refused to turn my head, to move, to look down, or any other action to accommodate one student receiving special, personlized treatment in my class, in a country that she chose to become a part of. No way.  If she was intimidated by members of her class, she needs to remove herself - preferrably from the country.</p>

		<p>While I do believe in reasonable accomodation for religious beliefs I do not think that what was offered this gal was in any way &#8220;reasonable&#8221;. If she cannot be in a class where men could possibly look at her then she does not need to be in a class in Canada period! </p>

		<p>All racial groups have a right to their own homelands.<br/>
Coming to white homelands and subverting the culture,limiting the ability of the indigenous racial/ethnic group to reproduce itself and prosper and exploiting the host country for tax moneys by way of lawsuits and stealing jobs by way of affirmative action type programs that prefer foreigners to the inigenous population is by definition GENOCIDE.<br/>
This is amoral and criminal genocide. This is the message that we must get out to the inhabitants of white homelands.<br/>
They must stop making excuses and wishing the colonizers would just &#8220;assimilate&#8221; or &#8220;learn the language&#8221;. That is not the answer to the problem.<br/>
Criticizing the invading nonwhite groups is a mute point. As even if they were model citizens it still would constitute a genocidal act to have them pouring into white indigenous homelands. <br/>
The perpetrators are the legislators under the control of powerful lobby groups.</p>
