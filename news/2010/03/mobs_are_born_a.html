<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/us/25mobs.html?hpw">Mobs Are Born as Word Grows by Text Message</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Urbina, New York Times, March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It started innocently enough seven years ago as an act of performance art where people linked through social-networking Web sites and text messaging suddenly gathered on the streets for impromptu pillow fights in New York, group disco routines in London, and even a huge snowball fight in Washington.</p>
<p>But these so-called flash mobs have taken a more aggressive and raucous turn here as hundreds of teenagers have been converging downtown for a ritual that is part bullying, part running of the bulls: sprinting down the block, the teenagers sometimes pause to brawl with one another, assault pedestrians or vandalize property.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The flash mobs have raised questions about race and class.</p>
<p>Most of the teenagers who have taken part in them are black and from poor neighborhoods. Most of the areas hit have been predominantly white business districts.</p>
<p>In the flash mob on Saturday, groups of teenagers were chanting &#8220;black boys&#8221; and &#8220;burn the city,&#8221; bystanders said.</p>
<p>In a Feb. 16 melee, 150 teenagers spilled out of the Gallery shopping mall east of City Hall during rush hour and rampaged through Macy&rsquo;s, knocking down customers and damaging displays.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Some blacks think it&rsquo;s important for the races to get along.  Others like to make life uncomfortable for white people.  </p>
<p>Philadelphia houses about 1.5 million people about half of whom are poor blacks, and a desirable Center City business/tourist district.  If they want to use it to keep their city a vibrant, happening tourist draw where two of the most important documents in the history of civilization were draft, they can.  If they want to terrorize everyone, then WN enclavism is not long in coming.</p>

		<p>Working class whites who live in Philly itself are already quite racially conscious compared to white Americans in general.  What they don&rsquo;t have is any help or support from other whites or society&rsquo;s institutions.  The government, both political parties, police, schools, media, churches and the capitalist class are all against them.  </p>

		<p>I must say that this whole concept of &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; is new to me. I had to look it up on Wikipedia to find out what it&rsquo;s all about. No wonder it seems new: it <i>is</i> new, made possible by the modern-day ubiquity of cell phones and instant messaging. </p>
<p>While Wikipedia mentions the pillow fights and impromptu disco routines, it is not until toward the end that it mentions the violent Philadelphia episodes. Is this another once relatively innocent activity that has turned sinister? It&rsquo;s beginning to look like when participated in by whites, flash mobs are harmless &#8220;performance art&#8221; and when participated in by blacks, flash mobs are another excuse to be violent.</p>

		<p>When blacks act out on their racism, the media must find a way to mitigate it.  </p>
<p>So, in this case they compare it to pillow fights?  Pillow fights??  It is absolutely absurd.  Pillow fights sounds like some sort of gay playtime.  And they compare it to impromptu disco routines in London?  What??  That doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>
<p>The media is trying to obfuscate it, but it is all very simple.  <br>
Flash Mobs = racist black hooligans</p>

		<p>I recently heard that American Idol&rsquo;s Paula Abduhl is planning to capitalize on these flash mobs by creating a TV &#8220;dance&#8221; series around them.</p>
<p>Assuming that  &mdash;  through the miracle of modern technology  &mdash;  these events will be coordinated by her TV network, I hope it plans on compensating communities for the extra police and fire crews they&rsquo;ll need to employ in case of spontaneous mob hysteria.  You know what can happen when too many of these &#8220;youfs&#8221; gather; primitive tribal instincts can overwhelm learned behaviors like restraint and common civility, and the next thing you know there&rsquo;s another &#8220;wilding.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You hit the nail on the head Tim from Indiana.  That&rsquo;s exactly what is going on.  No longer do blacks have to wait for hurricanes, a manufactured outrage, a vote that goes against them or some other real cause to take to the streets, riot, loot, molest and assault whites and businesses.  And, apparently, no longer do they do it in their own neighborhoods.  They are now texting to organize on whim, and taking it to the WHITE areas.  It&rsquo;s practice, I think, for what they&rsquo;ve been waiting for.  One of their favorite sayings amongst themselves is &#8220;come the revolution&#8221;.  Meaning, come the day blacks rise up en mass and kill whites ala Haiti.  This is just practice.  </p>

		<p>These sorts of actions are not mere crime and thuggery.</p>
<p>They are organized leftist terror actions organized with a purpose by radical organizers in the community.  Blacks in America are being covertly organized for violent actions in the future, through church, mosque, university class, civic groups aimed at the poor and disenchanted.  Through people with an agenda that is evil.</p>
<p>Whites are in for a big surprise in coming years.  Oh, if only we KNEW what was being taught and lectured upon in these all black universities and colleges.  If only we KNEW what was really being preached in their churches.  Reverend Wright is ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.  </p>
<p>Some decent voices in the black community are TRYING to alert the country.  But noone is listening to them.</p>

		<p>You know, the juxtapositions of white vs black &#8220;flash&#8221; mobs is striking.<br>
Whites have pilow fights; good natured fun, no injuries, just plain fun, like playing paintball or airsoft. <br>
Blacks? kick the life out of a helpless white woman, and by the dozens. What disgusting baboons, they do not deserve to rside in this hemisphere.<br>
For the love of God, when will the media show it for what it is?</p>
<p>No forget it, the MSM is a marxist, gay, white hating behemoth. The government despises us, even though it is white. Beurocracies are a bastion of brownness. Corporations hate whites, as they welcome a new era of servile, stupid third world customers who will eat poison food, buy worthless goods made by slave laborers in China, and not speak a word of complaint, because they come from hellholes.<br>
This is the world we face. It is already here, and almost in full, malodorous bloom.<br>
We can no longer wait for marxists to become un-insane, or for the media to be partly honest, or for government to represent us. we must form our own communities, states, and nations. The world-our world-has turned it&rsquo;s back on us completely. need we any more proof? are we still going to preach to this tiny choir? Better to close AmRen down, and take the kool-aid. Face facts, about a thousand people visit AmRen, at best. Perhaps not that many even know of it&rsquo;s existance. Vdare is only a little better off. Whites either hate themselves, or are affraid, or can&rsquo;t be bothered.<br>
This is like polish cavalry charging panzers and mechanized infantry. A slaughter.<br>
It&rsquo;s getting sick.</p>

<p>You are absolutly correct. This was something new made bye whites. Some students were sending messages to meet in some public place and do what they wouldn&rsquo;t do alone. In some flashmobs they just stood their and do like statues. In other flashmobs they were all wearing pink t-shirts or were clown.<br>
That was some kind of creative art.</p>
<p>Black flashmobs are actually not real flashmobs. They just want to beat up white people and maybe steal some televisions. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s new here? blacks love to find any excuse to riot, steal, and hurt others, especially those most unable to defend themselves. I really don&rsquo;t blame these creatures as much as I blame the white fools who defend every criminal action these low lifes exhibit. Without the fools we call white liberals most blacks would be lying under a tree with a spear waiting for the next injured animal to come along for their next meal. blacks not carried by fake white adulation seem to do very little to improve their own lives?</p>

		<p>Though not following the topic here I would like to bring to readers attention of dangerous developments in South Africa. Julias Malema the leader of the ruling party`s youth league sings a song &#8220;Kill the boere&#8221; (farmers) on many public occasions.  This song is totally racial and a call to violence.  More than 2000 white farmers have been killed and many more injured in farm attacks.  Yet the world takes no notice-was it the other way round and one white person says anything or does anything to one black person the whole country starts to quiver with marches and protests by black people.  Has a call to genocide been issued-loud and clear?  Or is the genocide in processs?</p>
<p>I  just wanted to bring it to the readers attention. </p>

		<p>Tim in India is right.  I never heard of &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; either   &mdash;   until now. It turns out to be just a new name for an old thing:  rioting. Or you can call it &#8220;wilding&#8221; to sound a bit fancier. Same stuff.</p>
<p>But well, if it&rsquo;s &#8220;Performance Art&#8221;, then it must be OK.  Anything goes in the name of art.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that more people aren&rsquo;t familiar with flash mobs. There are dozens of viral videos of fantastically orchestrated flash mobs floating around the internet. Most of them involve hundreds of Whites putting on performances with no other purpose than to bring some happiness into the lives of the people watching. It&rsquo;s a crying shame that Blacks have taken something that was growing into a fascinating phenomenon and turned it into typical Black behavior.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great flash mob in an Belgian train station where hundreds of Whites &#8220;spontaneously&#8221; break out into a dance routine to the Sound of Music:</p>

An innocent white trucker named Reginald Denny got his head smashed in by a brick-wielding black thug at that flash mob.<br>
That&rsquo;s why we need right-to-carry-concealed-weapons laws in this country&hellip;.</p>

		<p>From the original NYT article:</p>
<p><i>They are also considering making free transit passes for students invalid after 4 p.m., instead of 7 p.m., to limit teenagers&rsquo; ability to ride downtown.</i></p>
<p>Free?  When I was in high school, I had to pay for my bus passes, though only half price.  Also, if they were only good until 4:00 PM of a given school day, then I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to go home on the bus, as I stayed at school after class for things like study groups, group projects, sports practices, and some other things. </p>
<p>As I recall, this most recent wilding in Philadelphia took place starting at about 8:30 PM on last Friday or Saturday night, well after the cutoff time for the bus passes.  So the &#8220;children&#8221; (grrr) obviously didn&rsquo;t use the public buses.  Some of them CAN steal cars, after all! </p>
<p>The NYT also writes that some city officials want the parents held responsible for the wildings on the part of their minor offspring.  Yes, parents should rear children in the ways of common decency, but in matters like this one in Philly, it&rsquo;s already too late.  I suppose these officials want parents to construct miniature holding cells in their homes or apartments, and lock up their juvenile children inside their mini-jail for most of a given day.  </p>
<p>Though I shouldn&rsquo;t speak too soon:  Brooklyn already tried it in a way:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yzsd5ag" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yzsd5ag</a>    &mdash;    As Marty McFly told the infant that would become his uncle in the first BTTF   &mdash;   &#8220;Better get used to these bars, kiddo.&#8221; <br>

<p>What precious evasions from <i>The New York Times</i> and the Mayor.  The papers didn&rsquo;t disclose the race of the young woman whose teeth were knocked out when she was beaten by a dozen or more people,  though one source described her as being from the suburbs.   If this wasn&rsquo;t a hate crime many of the others committed by these flash mobs have been.  The Mayor and cops who refuse to pursue the hate angle to these crimes are guilty of violating the civil rights of the victims,  the news outlets that cover up the race of the victims are guilty of being accessories after the fact in these hate-crimes,  and before and during the fact in the inevitably next ones.   Contrast the legal and media reaction to these crimes to the Wal-mart announcement &#8220;crimes&#8221;:</p>

		<p>&#8220;City residents are also starting to complain about the number of unsupervised children, and child advocates are asking if there are enough activities to keep young people busy after school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmmm&hellip;.when I was in school, homework &amp; sports after school were about all I could handle. I guess I wasnt focused enough to engage in something meaningful like race rioting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We definitely need more jobs for kids, we need more summer jobs for kids, we need more after-school programming, and we need more parent support,&rdquo; said Shelly Yanoff, executive director of Public Citizens for Children and Youth, a children&rsquo;s advocacy group in Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Shelly. You just dont get it. Jobs and summer jobs? Participate in after school programming? That would be &#8216;acting white&rsquo;. So much easier to beat &amp; rob whitey. You get street cred for doing that too, ya&rsquo; know.</p>
<p>Just what do you think these &#8216;children&rsquo; do after such escapades?<br>
High five [or whatever nonsense they do nowadays], pound each other on the back and congratulate each other for all the pain and heartache they have inflicted upon their white victims. </p>
