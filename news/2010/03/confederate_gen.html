			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Zucchino, Los Angeles Times, March 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The proud lieutenant commander of the Smithfield Light Infantry of the Sons of Confederate Veterans is John M. Booker, a burly retired veterinarian with a trove of Civil War books and an abiding fascination with all things Confederate.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Booker has devoted himself to erecting a statue of Joseph E. Johnston, the last Confederate general to mount an effective fight against Union forces. Johnston ultimately surrendered to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman after the pivotal Battle of Bentonville, fought in March 1865 on a site a few miles from Booker&rsquo;s white-columned Greek Revival home.</p>
<p>In an era when public enthusiasm for Confederate memorials has waned, Booker and the 24 fellow members of the Smithfield Light Infantry want to honor Johnston and the soldiers who fought and died under him. The camp  &mdash;  as such units are called  &mdash;  erects tombstones on Confederate graves, cleans up Confederate cemeteries and attends historical lectures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Booker&rsquo;s camp refused to submit to the state&rsquo;s vetting process for historical memorials. Instead, it erected the statue on a sliver of farmland donated by a transplanted New Yorker with an interest in Confederate lore. Booker spearheaded a fund drive that he said raised $94,500 for the statue.</p>
<p>The farmland is part of the 6,000-acre battlefield, but outside the state-run historic site.</p>
<p>The state responded by erecting a low fence between the statue and the official state-run visitor center. Next to the fence are three new signs noting the state property boundary just a few strides from the general&rsquo;s likeness.</p>
<p>The statue depicts Johnston with his left arm raised. It&rsquo;s a call for his troops to hold the line against Yankee forces, Booker said. &#8220;And,&#8221; he added, &#8220;to hold the line against political correctness.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Booker pointed out that the plaque at the foot of the statue did not require anyone&rsquo;s approval. It reads: &#8220;Defender of the Southland to the End.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor was approval required for the 5-by-8-foot Confederate battle flag the camp intends to fly on a 30-foot pole next to the statue. The flag is a tribute to the troops who fought under it, Booker said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To critics, commemorating the Confederacy represents an unhealthy obsession with a racist past. But to men like Booker, whose family has lived in North Carolina for generations, it builds bonds and cements friendships through studying and honoring local history.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Booker] avoids matters of race and slavery by simply saying that Confederate soldiers &#8220;fought and died for their cause  &mdash;  they believed the Southland had been invaded.&#8221;<br>

<p>I love this! And I think there is some kind of second civil war in the US. Blood hasn&rsquo;t been drawn, yet, but with all those minorities trying to dispossess white America from its own country, we need to hold the line against these forces of darkness (pun intended).</p>

		<p>At first glance, this article seems flattering enough.</p>
<p>But reading the entire text of the original article reveals just another compromised and condescinding attitiude from the media as the SCV officer must defend and distance himself and Confederate symbols from association with racism.  </p>
<p>This otherwise admirable heritage group (Sons of Confederate Veterans) can be pretty thin-skinned on racial issues. Their Army of Tennessee branch has ostracized me for having conducted an unauthorized drive-by waving of the Confederate flag at a national NAACP convention in my ex-hometown the day after it (NAACP) declared a renewed campaign against South Carolina&rsquo;s display of that revered emblem.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, the Confederate general being honored as &#8220;Defender of the Southland to the End&#8221; actually surrendered some prime real estate to the Yankees in the vicinities of Richmond, Vicksburg, and Atlanta.  General Lee wasn&rsquo;t impressed with his willingness to withdraw without a fight.  </p>
<p>But I mean no disrespect.  Gen. Johnston was a loyal patriot with noble blood; his father served alongside Lee&rsquo;s father in the Revolutionary War.  And, in the waning days of the &#8220;Lost Cause,&#8221; Gen. Johnston DID go on the offensive at Bentonville, N.C., where he is being aptly memorialized.</p>
<p>P.S. I&rsquo;ll also give credit to the SCV for avoiding confrontation by placing the statue and the flag on premises where the gubment has no say-so. </p>

		<p>Let us never forget it was &#8220;The War of Northern Agression&#8221; - they invaded OUR homeland, and we fought to defend it.  We have a right to our heritage and a right to commemorate it.  My Southern mother married a Westerner, and I claim kin only to the Southern part of my heritage.  My people are from VA and NC, and I am very proud to be of that lineage.  Yes, my Stars and Bars are on my bedroom wall, because out here it&rsquo;d be death to fly them openly.  But I hope some day to be able to for real.  For now they fly in my heart.</p>

		<p>This may stun many a modernist, but not everything(be it Confederate, Yankee or what have you)is about blacks or non-whites of any type. Indeed, when I was growing up(in New York no less) in the 70&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s, I scarcely recall ever hearing about race one way or the other. Oh how I long for those days&hellip;  </p>

<p>Hate to break it to you, but the South fired the first shots of the war, at Ft. Sumter.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s overriding goal was to save the Union,  NOT to free the slaves. In fact, U. S. Grant said that if freeing the slaves was the reason for the whole civil war, he would never have fought.</p>

		<p>To Soprano Fan (I enjoy your posts, but I&rsquo;m afraid I need to correct you on this one):</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but as of December 20, 1860 (concurrent with South Carolina&rsquo;s ordinance of secession or &#8220;declaration of independence&#8221; from the Federal Union), those Yankees at Ft. Sumter constituted an invading force.  The North was attempting to conquer the South; not the other way around.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s armies  &mdash;  20% of which were recent immigrants  &mdash;  weren&rsquo;t able to accomplish this end without enlisting the aid of some 200,000 Colored Troops; hence the Federal government&rsquo;s eternal obligation to blacks, and a source of considerable resentment among Southern whites.</p>
<p><br>
To Un-PC:</p>
<p>My people are also from VA &amp; NC, and I too am very proud to be of that lineage.  I&rsquo;ve moved away from my old integrated neighborhood, and now feel comfortable flying my Confederate flag alongside &#8220;Old Glory&#8221; on holidays and special occasions.</p>
<p>Keep the faith, my friend, Deo Vindice!    </p>

		<p>  I used to be a somewhat militant Southerner . And I still try to rise to the occasion when defending the South is neccessary . I reverted to my original stance that the WBTS was an American tragedy after I started coming to Amren . And that is how the WBTS should be studied, as an American tragedy . I am not looking for a debate . I simply came to the conclusion after coming here that there was something much more important beginning to form in this nation than regionalism between whites . We are fighting for our survival . Regions that are 85% white or greater, do not always realize it but I think they eventually will . I just hope it will not be too late . I think I have a clue as to what I am speaking about . I grew up in a 72% black town, graduated from an 87% black school nearly 40 years ago and I now live in an appx 60 to 65% black county and town . And for all of those Copperheads up north, God bless you and thank you for your support .</p>

		<p>The standard story of the left today, as taught to school childrem, it that the WBTS was fought because evil white men had to be broken to stop slavery.  My kids said that was taught in high school.  The real issue of course was wheather an all powerful Federal government or decentralized State government was to be our mode of governance.  The Feds won.  So if you wonder how the federal government can dictate that you must buy health insurance, or for that matter anything else look back to 1865. </p>

		<p>Some years back I worked as a part-time temp as a tour guide at the site of the surrender in Durham, NC. It&rsquo;s called the Bennett Place. At that time, the gift shop sold Confederate items, but then things started to change. They used to do a re-enactment of the surrender, then it was decided they would just do a living history day. The Confederate items in the gift shop disappeared. Political correctness was taking over. </p>
<p>As an aside, at the History Museum in downtown Raleigh, in the Civil War section there&rsquo;s a life size figure of a Black Union Soldier, but not a Confederate figure to be found anywhere. Mind you, this is in North Carolina. One visit was enough for me.   </p>
<p>The smartest thing this SCV Camp did was to erect the Joseph E. Johnston monument on private land, because if you&rsquo;re beholden to the state what they give they can take away in a heartbeat.</p>

		<p>  I think what we are seeing is the culmination of nearly 50 years of politically correct schools and propaganda flowing out of Hollywood and the media . Our kids actually side with those whose opinions we oppose . In Columbus Ga, they have a museum with the remains of a Confederate gun boat pulled from the Chattahoochee River . It used to be called,&#8221; The Confederate Naval Museum.&#8221; It is now &#8220;The Civil War Naval Museum.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>My fellow conservatives and libertarians:  don&rsquo;t congragulate yourselves too soon on putting General Johnston&rsquo;s statute on private property.  The left (dems) are making noises about criminalizing opposition to their their ideas and agenda.  If it happens say goodbye to free speech.  To them, it is obvious that Gen Johnston is a symbol of &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Being on private property won&rsquo;t save him.  See where this is going?  You may not agree that this is about to happen.  Just wait for a couple Obama judges to be appointed to the supreme court.  The passage of socialized medicine proves to me that we now live in a tyranny of the majority over the minority.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve read a fair amount of the civil war era, but not near enough to have faith in a conclusive opinion. Their were apparently good arguments on both sides,&hellip; I guess one lingering doubt could ask&hellip; what would have happened if Lincoln didn&rsquo;t feel the need to resolve the slavery issue during his term? Could the slavery issue have worked its way out of existence with the general evolution of American society without the need of America tearing itself apart as happened? I cannot conclude that Lincoln was a simpleton looking for glory&hellip; He seemed very genuine, intelligent and very vexed.  George Washington was adamant about the need to preserve the Union and Lincoln was in line with this original idea. In any event this chapter should not be simplified into a good north and evil south as I see it, so as to justify erasing the whole Southern culture. This monument erected sounds healthy not only in defending the Southern culture but also in defending the US constitution in the right of self ruling people to question or even over throw the government if it is deemed tyranical or in violation of the constitution. </p>

		<p>To Petrarch:</p>
<p>Cotton had become a hot item in the international marketplace.  The Southern states grew it economically by using slave labor; and were supplying the industrial fabric manufacturers from New England to Old England across the pond.</p>
<p>The Yankee blockade of Southern ports deprived these manufacturers of the raw cotton they needed to keep their mills running, though capture of stockpiles of un-exported Confederate cotton gained high profits for the Federal officers who could get these goods to the New England mills.  England started experimenting with raising their own crops (in Turkey or India, I believe) which were inferior but kept their mills in operation.  Neither plan worked without putting great stress on the viability of the industry.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, Northern profit seekers and established Southern plantation owners proved that, while still in demand, cotton could be grown profitably by tennant farmers without enslaving the laborers.  But it remained a strained arrangement until technology provided steam-, and later, gasoline-powered tractors and mechanical harvesters.</p>
<p>At the time of The War, such technology was unthought of, and the South insisted on having the right to extend its profitable &#8220;peculiar institution&#8221; into the new western and southern territories opening up for expansion.  Lincoln&rsquo;s administration was committed to containing the slave system within its current boundaries.      </p>
<p>I believe the &#8220;war over slavery&#8221; could easily have been averted had the fanatic abolitionists of the North kept their cool for a few more decades giving technology a chance to catch up and make the whole slavery argument moot. </p>
<p>That, however, wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have avoided conflict over interpretations of the Constitution, or the Federal government&rsquo;s appetite for collecting Southern taxes to help build a more sophisticated Northern infrastructure; to name just a couple of the issues complicating the politics of the day.  Heck, Civil War or not, states&rsquo; rights issues are STILL unresolved today.  </p>
<p>But we do have a Union of States (with the Union having considerably more sovereignty than the states), and we have officially done away with slave labor.  Unfortunately, Congress never saw fit to send the freed slaves off to their own colony in Africa or Central America.  Lincoln had pushed for such a measure, and later, President Grant too.  Preliminarily, arrangements had been negotiated; it WAS feasible, but since most blacks resided in the South, the Republicans in power didn&rsquo;t see it as a priority.  In fact, loyal black voters tended to keep the Black Radical Republican Yankee carpetbagger regime in power for a number of years after the war.  Indignant White Southern resentment still seethes under the surface of polite resignation.  </p>

<p>  Yes, Petrarch it could have been abolished peacefully. Every major country abolished black slavery without bloodshed and the United States would have done so as well. I believe that Brazil was the last major nation to abolish slavery in 1888. Lincoln destroyed the Constitution and gave too much power to the Federal government and the Executive Branch. We are paying for that today &mdash; look at the unconstitutional Obamacare. </p>
