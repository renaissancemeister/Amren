			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JoAnne Allen, Reuters, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 16 percent of Americans between the ages of 14 and 49 are infected with genital herpes, making it one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases, U.S. health officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Black women had the highest rate of infection at 48 percent and women were nearly twice likely as men to be infected, according to an analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>About 21 percent of women were infected with genital herpes, compared to only 11.5 percent of men, while 39 percent of blacks were infected compared to about 12 percent for whites, the CDC said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Douglas said the increased rate of infection in blacks is not due to increased risk behavior but likely due to biological factors that make women more susceptible as well as the higher rate of infection within black communities.</p>

<p> I love it when someone makes a contention and then contradicts their own self in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Blacks are more susceptible to a host of STDs than Whites.  They also have substantially higher rates of teen pregnancy.  I suppose Douglas thinks all that&rsquo;s due to &#8220;biological factors&#8221; as well.  Wait a minute; maybe he&rsquo;s right.  After all, the bulk of evidence collected shows intelligence in humans is mainly due to &#8220;biological factors&#8221;.</p>

<p>Almost half of all black women have herpes.  That&rsquo;s an astounding percentage.  It&rsquo;s almost unbelievable it&rsquo;s so high.</p>

What? Are they SURE this Dr. Douglas is a REAL doctor, or just playing one for the CDC? Really, I&rsquo;ve never heard such a ridiculous statement. To even suggest that the spread of this STD is not due to increased risk behavior goes beyond irresponsibility on his part.</p>

		<p>Given the rapidly growing rate of promiscuity,miscegenation and  interracial sex among Whites (especially those under 45), it will only be a matter of time before our race faces a similar situatison. </p>

		<p>It is possible that they have more symptoms due to racial differences (but obviously it is due to risky behavior).</p>
<p>The thing about herpes is a LOT of infected people (some studies say the majority of people) never ever show signs so they happily live their lives without ever realizing they were infected. Just like the form that causes cold sores, most everyone has it but the only people that care are the people that have frequent cold sore outbreaks.</p>

		<p>As usual, articles about some dire circumstance among blacks states the statistical facts and then hurriedly, often within the same sentence, denies that black behavior or low intelligence has anything to do with it.  This particular circular contention is especially humorous: blacks have greater percentages of STD&rsquo;s not because of promiscuity but because there are more STD&rsquo;s in the black community!  </p>

<p>Notice the switch and bait???<br>
&#8220;the increased rate of infection in BLACKS is not due to increased risk of behavior but likely to the biological factors that make WOMEN more susceptible as well as the higher rate of infection within the black communities.</p>
<p>the argument  does not follow the example. Is it that white women do not have the same biological factors as black women?</p>
<p>Just noticing the obvious.</p>

		<p>For the life of me, I have never understood the young, liberal social justice metrosexual men out there who constantly pursue relationships with black girls. I have personally witnessed such young men in my work place who feel all &#8216;down with the people&rsquo; when they&rsquo;re courting these girls. </p>
<p>Okay, yes, some black girls are pretty, and a young man&rsquo;s hormones are raging, blah, blah, blah.  But when it&rsquo;s common knowledge that there is a one in two chance that the black girl you are talking to has some kind of horrible STD or another - why would you even take the chance!!!!</p>

		<p>A 48% infection rate is astronomical for any infectious disease, let alone an STD.<br>
 Using basic probability theory, binomial distribution and the rapid shrinkage of powers of one half, the likelihood of any random group of American black women above 5 individuals not having a herpes sufferer in their midst tends to the infinitessimal.</p>

		<p><i> Douglas said the increased rate of infection in blacks is not due to increased risk behavior but likely due to biological factors</i></p>
<p>Funny, but in the article on Alzheimer&rsquo;s that ran yesterday, researchers were quoted as saying that they did not think that the higher incidence of Alzheimer&rsquo;s in blacks was due to &#8220;biological factors&#8221; (implying that it must be due to concealed racism). Now that the subject is a disease that is clearly exacerbated by volitional behavior, it&rsquo;s suddenly the result of &#8220;biological factors.&#8221; </p>
<p>See the pattern here? It all depends on whether whitey can be blamed for it. Or I should say, how whitey can be blamed for it. No doubt other talking heads will figure out a way to claim that the increased rate of STDs in blacks is somehow due to poverty and white &#8220;racism.&#8221; It&rsquo;s all part of a campaign to make blacks feel helpless to change their own situation, to let them off the hook and put whitey on the hook instead.</p>

		<p>What about Hispanics? If the report doesn&rsquo;t tell you the percentage of Hispanics infected, you can just bet that they lumped Hispanics in with whites. The real percentage among white women must be quite a bit lower, especially since they tend to be quick about getting themselves treated.</p>

		<p>Since this has come up on this articles posting forum and has in the recent past, I am going to post a quote from an online medical article;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold Sores are caused by a type of the Herpes Virus 1, but it is rarely the same that causes Genital Herpes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cold sores do not equate to Genital Herpes, nor do they indicate a history of sexual promiscuity.  I have seen young children with this type of cold sore.</p>

		<p>I understand his point, but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s valid. </p>
<p>Why so high among Black women, and so much higher than Black men? Black men, after all, are much more promiscuous than Black women. Well, he says that women are more susceptible (his theory). </p>
<p>Why so high among Black women as opposed to other women? He says they are not necessarily screwing around more (though statistics say that this is not true) but it just that Black women have sex in the Black community as opposed to other racial communities. The Black community has lots of Herpes. So if a Black woman who is not that promiscuous has higher risk than a White woman with the same # of partners since the community she is sleeping with is so saturated with Herpes as opposed to the White community. </p>

<p>White women do not have a smaller statistical rate of infection because they get &#8220;treated.&#8221; There is no cure for herpes, and no test for women that can determine they are infected until they have an outbreak. White women have a smaller statistical rate of infection because they are not infected to begin with.</p>

		<p>I want to correct some statements that were made here about herpes infection.  Most cases of genital herpes are caused by Herpes simplex virus 2.  Herpes simplex virus 1 can also cause genital herpes.  Lafferty et al in 2000 found that 21% of heterosexual women in the US with genital herpes have HSV-1.  Both viruses come from the Herpesviridae family of enveloped DNA viruses.  They are incurable because they hide in the nervous system like the chickenpox virus, which can reactivate as herpes zoster (shingles).  Treatment for Herpes simplex can reduce transmission and symptoms.  Serological testing for Herpes simplex is available, but the US Preventative Services Task Force recommends against its routine screening.</p>
