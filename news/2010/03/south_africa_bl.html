<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8547621.stm">South Africa Black-Owned Farms &#8216;Failing&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 1994 almost 90% of the land was owned by white South Africans</p>
<p>Some 90% of farms redistributed to South Africa&rsquo;s black population from white farmers are not productive, the government has said.</p>
<p>Land reform minister Gugile Nkwinti warned the land might be repossessed if the farms continued to fail.</p>
<p>Almost 60,000 sq km (23,000 sq miles) have been redistributed under policies aimed at benefiting black people who were left impoverished by apartheid.</p>
<p>The land was bought from white farmers who sold up voluntarily.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says some black farmers are likely to argue that they have been struggling to get the resources and skills to develop their land.</p>
<p>And repossessing the land would provide a whole new problem for the government, our correspondent says, as any move to return the land to its former white owners is bound to be controversial.</p>
<p><b>Sensitive issue</b></p>
<p>The government had set a target of 2014 to redistribute one-third of white-owned land back to the black majority.</p>
<p>But Mr Nkwinti acknowledged that the deadline would not be kept.</p>
<p>He said the focus would now shift to helping the black farmers make their land productive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The farms  &mdash;  which were active accruing revenue for the state  &mdash;  were handed over to people, and more than 90% of those are not functional,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not productive, and therefore the state loses the revenue. We cannot afford to go on like that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No country can afford that.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of apartheid in 1994 almost 90% of land was owned by the white community, which made up less than 10% of the population.</p>
<p>Land reform is a sensitive issue in South Africa and has been brought into sharp focus by the decline of agriculture in neighbouring Zimbabwe, where many white commercial farmers have been violently evicted.<br>

		<p>If the blacks (or Afrikaners) had any sense they would have taken and entirely different approach.  First, the government would have opened a series of Agricultural Technical Schools to train future black farmers.   Similar to, but more vocationally oriented, our land grant college system.  Secondly, the government would have had civil and agricultural engineers start work on methods the reclaim more land for agricultural production instead of taking the land away from whites.</p>
<p>The main point everyone seems to miss is that there were NO FARMS in South Africa when the Afrikaner settlers arrived.  The farms were created by the white farmers.  Blacks can not &ldquo;reclaim&rdquo; something they never had. </p>
<p>Land, in and of itself, is not wealth producing.  Someone has to do something with it, whether that be farming, mining, logging, etc..  A farm is no different than any other enterprise. It must be managed (or cultivated, if you prefer) and maintained like any other business.  It is not like a backyard victory garden.  Modern agriculture requires a great deal of expertise.  Even Amish farms, while looking ever so quaint to tourists, require a degree of sophistication and technical knowledge that is beyond the average city dweller, let alone an African.  Farming requires planning ahead and delayed gratification, traits Africans rarely posses.  I am sure that most SA black farmers, despite having been farmhands themselves, truly believe you just put some seeds in the ground, sit back and drink malt liquor until it is time to harvest.<br>

		<p><i>&#8220;The land was bought from white farmers who sold up voluntarily.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh&hellip;of course.  Looking down the barrels of black-held guns, they &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; handed over their lands.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;any move to return the land to its former white owners is bound to be controversial.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Why?  Was it &#8220;controversial&#8221; when it was stolen from the Whites?  I must have missed that particular &#8220;controversy.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;He said the focus would now shift to helping the black farmers make their land productive.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Good luck with that one.  Of course, you could always try having those black farmers apply to the US government for handouts, on the basis of &#8220;discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The government had set a target of 2014 to redistribute one-third of white-owned land back to the black majority.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Nothing Racist about <i>that</i>, is there?  Well, no need to worry, Mr. Nkwinti.  The western media will politely turn their heads the other way, as usual.<br>

		<p>As long as foolish Western countries stay away and don&rsquo;t give aid to prop up black governments and economies, we&rsquo;re going to increasingly see this sort of thing: black plans to adjust for &#8220;wrongs&#8221; being abandoned, and whites increasingly given control, at least behind the scenes, and at least in certain areas (like food and the economy).</p>
<p>Only the most stupid and self-defeating blacks cannot see what happens when blacks are in charge.  It does not take a high IQ to get &#8220;when whites were in charge we ate, when blacks were in charge we didn&rsquo;t&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think this will happen in the government here: blacks may be given the most visible political appointee positions, but those will be turned into symbolic positions with little power.  The second tier, and less visible positions will be inhabited by competent whites who will quietly get the work done while the showboating blacks go around gabbing and acting important. </p>

		<p>Lucky SA whites, they are allowed to exist as long as they turn a profit for their new black overlords. As long as they continue to funnel tax revenues to the privileged black political class their genocide can be deferred for a few years.</p>

		<p>When whites settled in S.A. it was on vacant land that belonged to nobody.  They grew a first class civilization that had nuclear power and weapons long before many other nations.</p>
<p>Their big mistake was in allowing blacks in to work in order to alleviate their manpower shortage.  As we now know from being inundated from the hordes from south of the border, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for the invaders to decide that the land they sneaked into was really theirs all along.  Silly them.  They didn&rsquo;t know that until instigators told them so.</p>
<p>Will whites ever learn that they should NEVER allow non-white invaders into their land for any reason whatsoever?</p>
<p>If this nation breaks up into nation states as many have forecast, will white do-gooders in white enclaves insist on being &#8220;fair&#8221; to non-whites who come in for one reason or another or will they consist of whites who are sophisticated and savvy enough to understand that they should &#8220;never again&#8221; repeat their many mistake of the past?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be one of the whites who will insist on ousting any white do-gooder or any naive, gullible white who wants &#8220;to do the right thing&#8221; and &#8220;give them a chance.&#8221;  No thanks.</p>
<p>White do-gooders need a land all their own to screw up beyond repair.</p>

		<p>&#8220;black people were left impoverished by apartheid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note how the author cleverly lies.  The truth is that Black people were always &#8220;impoverished.&#8221;  They were impoverished for 20,000 years before they were discovered by Europeans.  Then Europeans arrived, and the Africans living under apartheid, benefited greatly from European agriculture, technology, medicine, hygiene, organization, infrastructure, etc.  Now that Whites are leaving, the Africans will revert back to their &#8220;impoverished&#8221; ways.  </p>
<p>50 years from now people will say that &#8220;black people were left impoverished by the disappearance of apartheid.&#8221;<br>

		<p>WHY AFRICA HAS GONE TO HELL</p>
<p>White Zimbabweans [he means Rhodesians] used to tell a joke &mdash; what is the difference between a tourist and a racist? The answer &mdash; about a week.</p>
<p>Few seem to joke any more. Indeed, the last time anyone laughed out there was over the memorable head-line &ldquo;BANANA CHARGED WITH SODOMY&rdquo; (relating to the Reverend Canaan Banana and his alleged proclivities). Zimbabwe was just the latest African state to squander its potential, to swap civil society for civil strife and pile high its corpses. Then the wrecking virus moves on and a fresh spasm of violence erupts elsewhere. Congo, Ivory Coast, Sudan, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, even Kenya . Take your pick, for it is the essence of Africa, the recurring A-Z of horror. Therefore, as surely as Nelson Mandela took those steps from captivity to freedom, his own country will doubtless shuffle into chaos and ruin.</p>
<p>Mark my words. One day it will be the turn of South Africa to revert to type, its farms that lie wasted and its towns that are battle zones, its dreams and expectations that lie rotting on the veldt. That is the way of things. Africa rarely surprises, it simply continues to appall.</p>
<p>When interviewed on BBC Radio, the legendary South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela spoke of the 350-year struggle for freedom by blacks in South Africa. The man might play his trumpet like a dream, but he talks arrant nonsense. What he has bought into is a false narrative that rewrites history and plays upon post-colonial liberal angst. The construct is as follows: white, inglorious and bad; black, noble and good; empire, bad; independence, good; the west, bad; the African, good. Forgotten in all this is that while Europeans were settling and spreading from the Cape, the psychopathic Shaka Zulu was employing his Impi to crush everyone &mdash; including the Xhosa &mdash; in his path, and the Xhosa were themselves busy slaughtering Bushmen and Hottentots. Yet it is the whites who take the rap, for it was they who won the skirmishes along the Fish and Blood Rivers and who eventually gained the prize.</p>
<p>What suffers is the truth, and &mdash; of course &mdash;  Africa. We are so cowed by the moist-eyed mantras of the left and the oath-laden platitudes of Bono and Geldof, we are forced to accept collective responsibility for the bloody mess that is now Africa. It paralyses us while excusing the black continent and its rulers.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear people agitate for the freezing of Third World debt, I want to shout aloud for the freezing of those myriad overseas bank accounts held by black African leaders (President Mobutu of Zaire alone is believed to have squirreled away well over $10 billion). Whenever apartheid is held up as a blueprint for evil, I want to mention Bokassa snacking on human remains, Amin clogging a hydro-electric dam with floating corpses, the President of Equatorial Guinea crucifying victims along the roadway from his airport. Whenever slavery is dredged up, I want to remind everyone the Arabs were there before us, the native Ashanti and others were no slouches at the game, and it remains extant in places like the Ivory Coast. Whenever I hear the Aids pandemic somehow blamed on western indifference, I want to point to the African native practice of dry sex, the hobby-like prevalence of rape and the clumps of despotic black leaders who deny a link between the disease and HIV and who block the provision of anti-retrovirals. And whenever Africans bleat of imperialism and colonialism, I want to campaign for the demolition of every road, college, and hospital we ever built to let them start again. It is time they governed themselves. Yet few play the victim card quite so expertly as black Africans; few are quite so gullible as the white liberal-left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the eve of this millennium, Nelson Mandela and friends lit candles mapping the shape of their continent and declared the Twenty-first Century would belong to Africa. It&rsquo;s a pity that for every Mandela, there are over a hundred Robert Mugabes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
So Britain had an empire and Britain did slavery. Boo hoo. Deal with it. Move on. Slavery ended here over two hundred years ago. More recently, there were tens of millions of innocents enslaved or killed in Europe by the twin industrialised evils of Nazism and Stalinism. My own first cousins &mdash; twin brothers aged sixteen &mdash; died down a Soviet salt mine. I need no lecture on shackles and neck-irons. Most of us are descendents of both oppressors and oppressed; most of us get over it. Mind you, I am tempted by thoughts of compensation from Scandinavia for the wickedness of its Viking raids and its slaving-hub on the Liffe. As for the 1066 invasion of England by William the Bastard&hellip;</p>
<p>The white man&rsquo;s burden is guilt over Africa (the black man&rsquo;s is sentimentality), and we are blind for it. We have tipped hundreds of billions of aid-dollars into Africa without first ensuring proper governance. We encourage NGOs and food-parcels and have built a culture of dependency. We shy away from making criticism, tiptoe around the crassness of the African Union and flinch at every anti-western jibe. The result is a free-for-all for every syphilitic black despot and his coterie of family functionaries.</p>
<p>Africa casts a long and toxic shadow across our consciousness. It is patronised and allowed to underperform, so too its distant black diaspora. A black London pupil is excluded from his school, not because he is lazy, stupid or disruptive, but because that school is apparently racist; a black youth is pulled over by the police, not because black males commit over eighty percent of street crime, but because the authorities are somehow corrupted by prejudice. Thus the tale continues. Excuse is everywhere and a sense of responsibility nowhere. You will rarely find either a black national leader in Africa or a black community leader in the west prepared to put up his hands and say it is our problem, our fault. Those who look to Africa for their roots, role-models and inspiration are worshipping false gods. And like all false gods, the feet are of clay, the snouts long and designed for the trough, and the torture-cells generally well-equipped.</p>
<p>I once met the son of a Liberian government minister and asked if he had seen video-footage of his former president Samuel Doe being tortured to death. &lsquo;Of course&rsquo;, he replied with a smile. &lsquo;Everyone has&rsquo;. They cut off the ears of Doe and force-fed them to him. His successor, the warlord Charles Taylor, was elected in a landslide result using the campaign slogan &ldquo;He killed my ma, he killed my pa, but I will vote for him&rdquo;. Nice people. Liberia was founded and colonised by black Americans to demonstrate what slave stock could achieve. They certainly showed us. Forgive my heretical belief that had a black instead of a white tribe earlier come to dominate South Africa, its opponents would not have been banished to Robben island. They would have been butchered and buried there.</p>
<p>When asked about the problem of Africa, Harold Macmillan suggested building a high wall around the continent and every century or so removing a brick to check on progress. I suspect that over entire millennia, the view would prove bleak and unvarying.</p>
<p>Visiting a state in West Africa a few years ago, I wandered onto a beach and marvelled at the golden sands and at the sunlight catching on the Atlantic surf. It allowed me to forget for a moment the local news that day of soldiers seizing a schoolboy and pitching him head-first into an operating cement-machine. Almost forget. Then I spotted a group of villagers beating a stray dog to death for their sport. A metaphor of sorts for all that is wrong, another link in a word-association chain that goes something like Famine&hellip; Drought&hellip; Overpopulation&hellip; Deforestation&hellip; Conflict&hellip; Barbarism&hellip; Cruelty&hellip; Machetes&hellip; Child Soldiers&hellip; Massacres&hellip; Diamonds&hellip; Warlords&hellip;Tyranny&hellip; Corruption&hellip; Despair&hellip; Disease&hellip; Aids&hellip; Africa.</p>
<p>Africa remains the heart of darkness. Africa is hell.</p>

		<p>&#8220;At the end of apartheid in 1994 almost 90% of land was owned by the white community, which made up less than 10% of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Whites were mere 10% of the population because blacks bred like flies thanks to the medical treatment and hygiene introduced by Whites.<br>

		<p>The entire argument on land ownership in South-Africa is a fraudulent one. Firstly it was said that whites owned 90% of the land in South-Africa this was in fact never true, white farmers owned 80% of agricultural farmland but that is only 2% of the entire South Africa, I repeat that, agricultural viable farmland makes up only 2% of the entire South-Africa. Secondly it excluded the traditional black homelands (had very good farmland I must add) which have since been incorporated into South-Africa and the land owned by the government itself because the government is now entirely black. Thirdly the article states whites making up less then 10% (owning that land) but historically whites at one time (1900&rsquo;s) made up at least a quarter of the countries population, so how is possible to keep the white population financially responsible for the irresponsible explosion in black population.</p>

		<p>Again, missing is that the majority of blacks, zulus, etc., were also newly migrating into the cone of Africa at the same time that Afrikaners were, so it was a fairly empty land that was up for grabs.  There were only a few roaming bands of nomadic hotentots.  And as other posters pointed out, there were no farms in the cone before the whites came.  There isn o &#8216;istoric&rsquo; homelands for the bantus who entered from the north.  Everywhere the boers went and started farms, it was empty land!</p>

		<p>Seems to me the Black SA Goverment is learning what the Black City Goverments are learning in America. Once you drive out Whitey who is going to produce income, both private and goverment income disappears like black magic.<br>
Scratching their burry head they figure out that they want as many white people as possible to stay (as long as they can maintain goverment power).<br>
Then they wonder what has happened to all the Liberal Whites that helped them get power.Hhhmmmm&hellip;.they were among the first whites to skeedadle. WHY??? (I scratch my head on that one also)<br>
Quietly (like Obama) they know they are over their heads&hellip;.<br>
What has always worked in the past against Whitey&hellip;.VIOLENCE<br>
Look for Obama to get violent in the next couple of years. He has the Brown Shirts (Black Panthers, Black Muslims, Crips, Blods).</p>

		<p>The whites were threatened by a black minister today with war.</p>
<p>What is happening is that some whites have declared disputes with their municipalities, because these municipalities have stopped delivering services and frequently one can, for instance see raw sewage flowing down the streets. These municipalities are not doing what they are paid to do such as maintaining roads and other necessary infrastructures.</p>
<p>The blacks are also rioting because of poor service delivery, but unlike the whites they have always gotten it for free.</p>
<p>There are 5.2 million tax payers in South Africa, most of which are white. Then there are 45 million blacks in South Africa who don&rsquo;t pay tax and demand everything for free.</p>
<p>When the whites get upset, because they are paying for non existent services they are threatened with war.</p>

<p>It is in Arkikaans unfortunately.<br>
Here in Africa we have censorship by language by the controlled media. Any news article that they don&rsquo;t want the international community to know of is always only published in Afrikaans.</p>
<p>Things are heating up.<br>
Currently they are killing our farmers at the rate of about 3/week and the total rate of whites at about 30 per day.<br>
The threats are escalating and we all are fearing the coming white genocide.</p>

		<p>The following is total fiction.<br>
&#8220;Hello Mr Gugile Nkwinti, it&rsquo;s been a few years since you bought my farm and moved in your hand picked black farmer so I thought I&rsquo;d pay the old place a visit. But where I grew maize there is nothing but weeds. Could it be that you intend to bring in goats to graze all this worthless scrub? I note there is a countrywide shortage of maize so perhaps you would like me to resume my previous activity.. just as your farm manager, you understand. I have no wish to usurp the rightful owner who, by the way, is nowhere to be found. I would accept a two year contract, payable in advance and free accommodation in my old farmstead. I will need all my farm hands to return as they are excellent workers, oh, and the irrigation system, tractors and harvester equipment seem to have been removed, perhaps for maintenance, well, I&rsquo;d like those back too. Of course, you may suspect my motives as White people simply cannot be trusted so I will also only take 15% of the harvest value as a productivity bonus and you can use the rest to help feed the nation. I will need fresh seed and fertilizer as the stock I left behind in the storehouse seems to have been taken away for safekeeping. As for repairs to the fencing to keep the wild animals off the crop and the missing generator&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Afrikaner wrote at 10:00 AM on March 4:  You are 100% correct.  I have been called a racist here in Spain by expat Brits who have retired here and who have never been to sub-Saharan Africa and who are illiterate enough to believe unquestionably what they read in the Marxist sponsored propaganda sheets.  It is time really now for the whites in South Africa and Zimbabwe to try and win back the land that was stolen the same way that the ANC/PAC Marxists took it.  The black masses will be grateful as they can then eat again.</p>
<p>Genocide is being forced on the whites and the prophecy that when Mandela (that ex-terrorist who would have been hung if a black govt. had been in power when he confessed to the planning of terrorism in the 1960s in Court) dies, the poor blacks led by the terrorist blacks will rise up and slaughter all the whites.  This must not be allowed to happen and the West must be kept informed so they would be implicit in any such acts, as guilty as the black terrorists there who know now that they are economically doomed without the whites&rsquo; skills and determination to succeed.</p>
<p>It is amazing how many Brits and Spanish here do not know why Mandela was jailed and they are shocked when I tell them for terror planning.  I lived in SA until 1999, when we escaped the crime and corruption in govt.  We have seen the future and the future is Zimbabwe sadly: unless action is take now to avoid it.</p>
<p>African black governments are planning to claim large reparations from the West (US$ 67 billion a year has been published so get ready) for the &#8220;man-made&#8221; global warming as they listen to our fools who say it is man-made by the developed countries, us.  So when they are starving with &#8220;climate change induced famines&#8221;, they will expect us to feed them.</p>
<p>So it is important for us in the West to have our leaders who will refuse such demands and make them stand on their own two feet, something that most will not be able to do, I guess (because they will have ejected/slaughtered those who were the farmers and entrepreneurs).  Shame but that is the way of Mother Nature to keep populations in check.</p>

<p>Yep.  Just in the past week the &#8220;diva&#8221; (and deeply incompetent) Desiree Rogers was replaced by the WH with a behind-the-scenes white woman who can actually get the job done.</p>

		<p>I would like to point out that throughout the period when blacks were supposedly being impoverished by apartheid there was steady immigration of blacks from black run countries <i>into</i> South Africa.  It was better to be a second class citizen in South Africa with a job and a full belly than to be in an African country run by people who looked like yourself.<br>

		<p>The world is only now beginning to wake up to the fact that the main stream media does not always report neutrally on a subject, but frequently slants it to project a certain view. Today this biased reporting is known as propaganda and the world is only now beginning to realise that news they heard of South Africa during the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s was slanted to along the now familiar lines of evil whitey, good black man.</p>
<p>The reason for this was that the world elites coveted the minerals. These minerals have been a curse to my people and we have been pulled into many wars throughout the centuries because of it, like the Anglo Boer war.</p>
<p>After 1994 when the Marxist ANC took power the first thing that happened is that the big mining companies that had to trade on the South African stock exchange moved to the London stock exchange, Since then we have had the opening of over 300 new mines in South Africa, often at the expense of the environment.<br>
This is particularly hypocritical as it is international British and American mining companies that could not care less about the South African environment, but at the same time are pushing for a GLOBAL taxation system through the focus on man made global warming. </p>
<p>Fact is the blacks had a better live during the days of apartheid.<br>
Firstly they lived longer.<br>
Pay attention to the above statement, because you only live longer if you are safer and have access to better medical services.<br>
https://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/f42a1a2a96084d228497288466a7fb95/27-07-2004-07-40/Life_expectancy_down_<br>
https://news.iafrica.com/sa/1106301.htm</p>
<p>The biggest trick the media pulled over the eyes of the world was with Mandela. Mandela was a terrorist and was in jail, because he ordered the CHURCH street bombing, which he ordered. Women and children died during this bombing. Mandela himself admitted in court.</p>
<p>How Mandela got to power in 1994 is an interesting if unknown story. The banking elites approached him and made hi the offer of  financial support in turn for certain favours once he becomes the ruler. These conditions were multiple mineral concessions and the ownership of the reserve bank.</p>
<p>Whe Mandela complied after the ANC victory the Western media made him into a God. They loved him for this and even gave him the Nobel peace price. They even placed a statue of him of their famous Travalgar square. They sure love those that give them access to Billion and billions of dollars.</p>
<p>It was all about power and greed and the international fight to control the South African mineral wealth with the Afrikaner frequently demonised because he happened to be living where this wealth was located. </p>

		<p>This and other similar sites is the only way I get any information about the world since it is mostly censored by the U.S. military. I am on a private net but it is still closely monitored by the governmenet, AR is blocked on U.S. military internet cafe&rsquo;s computer systems for &#8220;hate speech and racism&#8221; We have some people on this camp now from SA and in conversation with them, they say conditions are exactly as described and feard in this article and are moving their families out.</p>
