			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zaytuna College, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s first Muslim college is seeking students for its first freshman class. Will you be one of them?</p>
<p>Zaytuna College wants to welcome an extraordinary group of students .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p><b>Is Zaytuna College for me?</b></p>
<p>Zaytuna College can only achieve its aspiration of becoming an elite college if it is able to attract excellent students. For us, an excellent student is not necessarily one who is merely among the &#8220;best and the brightest,&#8221; although an excellent student is certainly one who has been generously blessed intellectually. However, intellect without character, a strong work ethic, an open mind, and a commitment to the betterment of humanity will do little to fulfill the purpose of Zaytuna College.</p>
<p>We wish to attract students who are not only blessed with these characteristics, but who also have a deep and abiding respect for the heritage of prophetic knowledge and wisdom, students who see in the past keys that unlock the door to a brighter future. It is our vision to wed students who meet this description with teachers of a similar character to create a vibrant educational institution where knowledge is placed in the service of tradition, and where learning is an ongoing, dynamic process that works for a healthy future for all who inhabit this planet.</p>
<p><b>Requirements for Admission</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to accept individuals who have excelled in multiple facets of their life. Besides the requirement of a high school diploma or equivalent, factors to be considered in evaluating applications for admission include GPA, SAT and/or ACT scores, course work, and extracurricular activities. We will examine their academic records, community service records, recommendations, as well as a personal statement indicating why they want to attend Zaytuna College. Applicants may also be invited for an interview with the Admissions Committee. We will consider each candidate individually and will make decisions based on a thorough evaluation of each application. Zaytuna strives to admit a diverse student body.</p>
<p>Zaytuna College does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national and ethnic origin in the admission of applicants, the administration of its educational or other policies and its scholarship and tuition assistance programs, and any other Zaytuna-administered programs. Zaytuna admits students of any race, color, national, and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the College.</p>
<p><b>Note on the Arabic language prerequisite:</b></p>
<p>Incoming freshmen must have completed the equivalent of one year of university-level Arabic prior to enrolling at Zaytuna College.</p>
<p>* Applicants who believe they have satisfied this requirement must take a proficiency exam administered by Zaytuna College (scheduled after they are admitted to the College).</p>
<p>* Applicants who have not satisfied this requirement prior to admission, or who do not pass the proficiency exam administered by Zaytuna, must attend the Zaytuna Summer Arabic Intensive program (June 21  &mdash;  August 13, 2010).</p>
<p>For more information about the Summer Arabic Intensive program, visit arabicintensive.org.<br>

		<p>While there is a big overlap between the Arabic language and Muslims, there are a number of other languages that are native tongues for adherents of Islam.  OTOH, Pashto, Urdu, Farsi, Turkish, Chechen, Tagalog, Thai, Malay and Ebonics are some of these languages.  Zaytuna College in Berkeley, California claims to be non-discriminatory, but seems to discriminate against native speakers of at least nine languages of Islam.</p>

		<p>   I noticed that the word religion is left out of its supposed anti-discrimination policy; I would assume that non-Islamics would not be allowed to become students, equal or unequal treatment; pretty stealthy by the Muslims; eh ?</p>

		<p>Wow, by that description, Marx and Mohammed have met and are getting along just fine! The canned &#8216;respect for diversity&rsquo; language just makes me want to throw up, while at the same time, I can read between the lines and know this will be just another Jihad college, while trying to look respectable.</p>

		<p>We have far to many muslim things in America NOW, which includes the stOOpid black converts. Allied forces in 1944 were allowed ashore and the Germans paid for that mistake, this &#8220;school&#8221; will be the Normandy Beach invasion foothold in the U.S. and there will be no throwing them out then. On the positive side, the only muslims in the U.S. to attend such a &#8220;college&#8221; will be American blacks! Saudi and Kuwaiti college students don&rsquo;t go to muslim colleges, they come to the U.S. from where most of the women do not want to return to their own countries prompting prominant Saudi families to actually klidnap their daughters and force them to resturn to Saudi on private jets. No people, allowing a muslim college on American soil is certainly the Normandy Beach head of our time.</p>

		<p>It will be interesting to see what happens if they become accredited and start receiving government money.  How would this affect the Muslim nature of their school?  It would also be interesting to see what happens if Jews choose to attend.</p>

		<p>There is or was a Soka University in California, where all students were required to be fluent in Japanese.  It was intended as a college for the children of Japanese businessmen on extended assignments in the US.  They didn&rsquo;t want their valued kids to be contaminated by an American college, and I can&rsquo;t blame them.  This Moslem place sounds like the same deal.  They won&rsquo;t receive any government funding, so they can do as they wish.  It won&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s not accredited by an American accrediting body because it will be accredited by an Arab organization, just like Soka U was only concerned about having standing among Japanese academics.  If somebody wants to go to grad school in the US, their degree from this place will be as good as one from a foreign university. </p>

<p>This college needs to be flooded with millions of applications from Christian students. Let us see how non-discriminatory the acceptance process will be.</p>
<p>That Arabic proficiency will be a tough one however.</p>

		<p>Michigan patriot, if you check their Q &A; section, you&rsquo;ll see that they do accept non-Muslims.  Why &#8220;religion&#8221; is not listed on their &#8220;qualifications&#8221; page is another question; I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s their way of saying they strongly prefer Muslims.  After all, if they didn&rsquo;t, eventually the school might lose its Muslim character.</p>

		<p>I can understand the Japanese wanting to set up their own college here in the US. Most Universities in the US have become an extension of the public school system and are now voluntary day care centers for the 18 - 22 set. How many middle class parents would shudder at the thought of junior becoming a electrical lineman even though he could make $25 - 30 an hour after achieving journeyman status. </p>
<p>A college degree is fine and dandy if one is motivated and has the ability to do the work. I realize that the degree is required to get ones foot in the door of most corporations. This is an indirect result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. You can discriminate on the basis of education. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not Mormon and have no desire to attend BYU. Even the 2 - 3% of non Mormon students who attend have to go through a process where a leader in the Mormon church signs off for your worthiness to attend. But it is their University, and they are free to run it as they see fit. </p>
<p>Under our current laws, Zaytuna is free to operate and I would hope that they don&rsquo;t receive a nickel of government aid, like Hillsdale College in Michigan, but I suspect that they will have their hand out in due course. But unlike the Japanese, the Islamic world are at war with everyone else on the planet. Who will be the mascot</p>

		<p>No surprise that this school is located in Berkeley, Ca.</p>
<p>However, I was taken aback to see the website describe Berkeley as &#8220;A center of intellectual and spiritual life in America&#8221; especially since the whites who live there are not very religious.</p>

<p>You raise an interesting point.  There is a concept in Islam called &#8220;awrah,&#8221; that is, the parts of a body that others of your gender and the opposite gender are not allowed to see and must be covered.  The rules can get complicated, and depend on whether the situation is inter-gender, intra-gender, and the context.  However, I know that a lot of public swimming pools in England are having to contort themselves to the sensitivities of Islam, when it comes to both men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s swimwear, and behavior inside the locker room, and shower requirements.  I&rsquo;m just wondering how different athletics and sports will be different at Zaytuna College, in even more ways than you suggest.</p>

		<p>The oldest university in the world in continuous operation since its founding is the University of Al-Karaouine.</p>
<p>It is located in Fez, Morocco.</p>
<p>It was founded in 859 A.D.  </p>
<p>It has had an excellent reputation in the areas of mathematics and astronomy.  I imagine they also award degrees in religious studies.</p>
<p>This rinky-dink school in Berkley is probably a front.</p>

<p>Actually it was started by a religious cult &#8220;Soka Gakkai&#8221; largely for prestige reasons. The hard times it has are probably a result of non-believers finding out when they go there that they are going to get a hard sell of what is a blend of faith-healing and prosperity buddhism, focused on their great leader Ikeda.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think too many non-believer Japanese would want to attend even if the alternative was an urban public school in LA.</p>
