<h1><a href="https://www.startribune.com/local/86294477.html">Pact to Help Minneapolis Black Students Falters</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Johns, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The &#8220;Covenant,&#8221; a pact intended to close the enormous achievement gap between black and white students in Minneapolis public schools, may be falling apart.</p>
<p>Disagreements over how to proceed and the resentments of some black participants who feel shut out of the process have festered. In January, a meeting about the agreement devolved into shouting as children were ushered out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The only thing everybody agrees on is that the performance of black students in the district is a &#8220;tragedy,&#8221; said Kinshasha Kambui, a former aide to Mayor R.T. Rybak and a community activist who signed the agreement.</p>
<p>Only 34 percent of the district&rsquo;s black students graduate from high school in four years, compared with almost 70 percent of whites, according to state figures. Last year, only 8.6 percent of black students were proficient on state science tests, compared with 61.4 percent of white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2008 Covenant says that the city&rsquo;s schools and black families &#8220;must commit to working with a deliberate focus on African-American students in order to overcome a legacy of educational inequity.&#8221; It focuses on teacher training, school stability and keeping track of what works.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Covenant was seen as a hopeful sign that resolve might finally be high enough to turn the tide of failure. But for some, resolve has turned to recrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One district ally said some community members are angry because the district might not implement a $700,000 behavior-management program run by Covenant advocate Titilayo Bediako.</p>
<p>Black parents have long distrusted the Minneapolis public schools.<br>

		<p>A covenant implies a contract.  And a contract is only valid if, among many other things, the objects of consideration are legitimate.  The reason this &#8220;covenant&#8221; is bogus is because it is impossible to erase the black-white (or black-nonblack) achievement gap, because it&rsquo;s impossible to eliminate IQ differences between blacks and whites (or blacks and other non-black races).  </p>

		<p>Should this really surprise anyone?  The news has been reporting on efforts to close the &ldquo;achievement gap&rdquo; for 40 years.  It is always the same story; no matter how much money is invested or what methods are used, the effort always fails.  Yet most Americans still believe the propaganda that Black underachievement is solely the result of White racism. Will we ever be able to speak openly and honestly about race without being vilified?</p>

		<p>What a surprise: a $700,000 behavior-management program was unable to alter genes.  </p>
<p>What to do?  What to do?  I know!  Let&rsquo;s spend another $700,000.  Although closing-the-pesky-gap programs didn&rsquo;t help the last 10 times we tried it, I&rsquo;m sure it will work this time.</p>

		<p>Minneapolis has a revolving door black population of welfare migrants who come for all the freebies and then leave when they can no longer stand the weather or when the criminal justice system gets them on the radar. Then number of legitimate black residents here is miniscule, the rest are dregs even by black standards and it is the hopeless children of those dregs that this reporter is writing about. They will get the same results by burning the $700,000 in a bonfire.</p>

		<p>In other news, a $700,000 program to close the skin-color gap between Africans and Europeans has been declared a complete failure.  </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve tried everything,&#8221; said Dr. Dingbat, Special Director of Spending Taxpayer Money to Make all People and Things Equal.  But, special conferences, seminars, after-school programs, and even a &#8220;Midnight Skin-Color&#8221; party featuring a Rap band has been unable to either lighten the skin color of Africans or darken the skin color of Europeans.  The gap remains.  </p>
<p>School administrators plan on doubling the money spent on the program next year.  &#8220;We will not give up, until all students have equal skin color,&#8221; said Dr. Dingbat.  &#8220;We must commit to working with a deliberate focus on African-American students in order to overcome a legacy of skin-color inequity.&rdquo; <br>

<p>This is hardly unique to Minneapolis. Most humans distrust, to some extent, what they do not understand and cannot fully comprehend. For blacks, formal education and academic excellence is one of those things - it is beyond them in so many ways, and they dislike and distrust all that pertains to it.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The 2008 Covenant says that the city&rsquo;s schools and black families &#8220;must commit to working with a deliberate focus on African-American students in order to overcome a legacy of educational inequity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Educational inequity&#8221; is just an excuse to cover up black lack of intelligence.  Everything in the book, and then some has been tried&hellip;supported by billions of dollars&hellip;.but blacks stay where they are, which is dismally low, compared to not just whites, BUT ALL OTHER RACES AS WELL.</p>
<p>Thousands of tests over the years unequivocally point out that blacks are not on an intellectual par with ANY RACE in the US, so how is anything going to help them?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that nothing will magically raise their intelligence, so the problem will never be solved.  And that won&rsquo;t be the only thing that will be unchanged.  Cry baby whining and blaming everyone but themselves will continue on unabated.</p>
<p>God pity the poor white kids and their parents who have to put up with this bunch of incompetents and pretend we&rsquo;re all equal in intelligence.</p>

<p>After Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs in the 1998 season, the Missouri state legislature changed the colloquial name of I-70 in St. Louis City to &#8220;Mark McGwire Highway,&#8221; and it was the Mark Twain Highway before.  Now that McG has been exposed as a steroid cheat, the state is about to undo it and revert back to Mark Twain.  The afternoon drive hosts at a black radio station in St. Louis wants it to be something other than Mark Twain, because they say he&rsquo;s not relevant to those who live near where I-70 traverses in St. Louis City.  I agree, he wrote books, and to most blacks, books are as alien as unobtanium.  &#8220;If you wanna hide something from a black man, put the thing in a book and put the book in a library.&#8221;   &mdash;   Onion Horton, black talk radio host in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Interesting that they would phrase it so bluntly. And in what city, state or country, and in what period in all of recorded history was this enormous achievement gap between black and white ever closed? Of course we must never ask this question, lest we let our educators off the hook.</p>
<p>Besides, we all know it&rsquo;s just due to &#8220;racism&#8221; anyway!</p>

		<p>I once had a discussion with a lady who was a retired school teacher. She was talking about how black children don&rsquo;t have enough educational opportunities as other children. I, of course, opened my mouth and said that they don&rsquo;t have the ability to achieve like Whites. She insisted it was a social problem. </p>
<p>I finally looked her straight in the eye and said, &#8220;You know how people always say that Asians are smart?&#8221; She agreed. I then said, &#8220;Well, blacks AREN&rsquo;T so smart.&#8221; That was the end of that conversation. </p>

		<p>I would like to challenge the assumptions of many on this discussion forum with this news story (EXCERPTED, BELOW):</p>
<p>&#8221; &hellip; These precocious London-based tykes, known as the &#8220;Wonder Twins,&#8221; floored academics a year ago when they (9 years old) aced University of Cambridge&rsquo;s advanced mathematics exam. They are the youngest students to ever pass the test.</p>
<p>The future little scholars&rsquo; father, Chris, and mother, Ann, immigrated to Britain from Nigeria more than 30 years ago and have actually been down this prodigy route before with their three older children, who are also overachievers. </p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s oldest daughter, Anne-Marie, is now 20, but at age 13, she won a British government scholarship to take undergraduate courses at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Christiana,  &hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth, then, must be even worse.  A large percentage of Minneapolis&rsquo;s black student population is made up of Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean and Liberian refugees, and their graduation rate has to be higher.  And, thus, the &#8220;African-American&#8221; rate lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;compared with almost 70 percent of whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>I was in the Navy with a few guys from Minnesota. For whatever reason; liberal brainwashing, growing up in productive all white communities, etc., the guys from MN seemed to take the longest amount of time to realize what they were dealing with when it came to blacks. I even knew a guy from northern Maine who had never seen a black person face to face until the day he arrived for basic that picked up the differences pretty quickly. </p>
<p>What you see in Minneapolis is probably an equivalent to what is happening in the Scandinavian countries and the massive influx of 3rd world muslims. I&rsquo;m sure the black parents don&rsquo;t trust the schools; they have walked into an environment where nobody knows how they act, are given gobs of freebies to compensate them for those benighted southerners and they still can&rsquo;t get anywhere. </p>
<p>If the parents want to scream racism; just point out &#8220;Why is it that people from Korea can come here, they don&rsquo;t speak any English, get a business up and running in your ghetto, and in five to ten years they are doing well and their kids are the class valedictorians&#8221;. All the money, government threats, etc are not going to turn a bunch of dull-witted individuals into brain surgeons overnight. <br>
 <br>
What is it with the state of Minnesota and they dogged determination to fix the problems of every other state. I don&rsquo;t live there and pay their taxes, thank goodness. </p>

		<p>I like how educators, when faced with such a disparity in white-black achievement levels, somehow believe the method is flawed and by increasing funding to this group it will change. Are African Americans simply stupid and, therefore, cannot keep up to the others? A basic question that will go unanswered.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #5.  When you hear about these minority populations in these really out of the way places, what plantations were there 100 years ago that brought those people there?  The weather is bad for much of the year and there is no real &#8216;night life&rsquo; or &#8216;action&rsquo; to speak of, so they are obviously coming for the freebies.  What does Minnesota (or Wisconsin, Montana, etc) owe voodoos?  Where is the historical inequity or legacy of discrimination?  Then it&rsquo;s funny how in those places the teachers colleges push the white guilt thing.  How have the whites in those places discriminated against non-whites?</p>

		<p>This achievement-gap lament is being heard all over the nation now as available government funds are shrinking and there is no longer good money to throw after bad.  A half century and gazillions of dollars have not shown overall improvement in black scores, and the reason for this is an open secret.  W.E.B DuBois spoke of a &#8220;talented tenth&#8221; among blacks, and he was right.  The ultimate solution will probably be to reinstitute black schools that will have their own agendas and grading systems.  The talented tenth can attend integrated institutions if desired, but the pressure will be off for those with low IQ&rsquo;s to excel.</p>

For the most part the (productive) people of this area (MN, WI, etc.) are only three generations away from people who had NOTHING, started with NOTHING, built EVERYTHING, and are now expected to hand over ALL.  With nothing but their bare hands, work ethic, morals, values, and INTELLIGENCE they created a fine part of the country to live and prosper.  All of this was done with very few or no handouts, set-asides, programs&hellip; After acomplishing this we are told to feel guilty about about our skin and it&rsquo;s so called &#8220;privilage&#8221; is holding down others and created an achievement gap?

Suppose you enlighten us with concrete (verifiable) percentage statistics on the average intelligence quotient of Nigerian men, women and children. That would certainly be enlightening, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Last year, only 8.6 percent of black students were proficient on state science tests, compared with 61.4 percent of White students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The average black IQ is 15 points lower than the average White IQ. Blacks simply do not possess the intelligence to compete with Whites.  However, political correctness mandates that we are all &#8220;equal.&#8221;  Sadly, and in spite of all of the contrary evidence, blacks truly believe that they are equal to Whites.  So blacks are left to conclude that since Whites succeed, their failures must be the fault of others. &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;Privilege&#8221; must be the reason.  What else can it be if everyone is equal?  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in the Twin Cities for thirty years. The welfare benefits are the main culprit for drawing blacks here but there is also a huge push given by three strikes laws in other states. So not only are they dependent underachievers a good share of them have significant felony convictions.

		<p>Regarding post #12</p>
<p>The Minneapolis School district did have an incompetent &#8220;diverse&#8221; superintendent a few years back.</p>
<p>Use a search engine to look up Thandiwe Peebles + Minneapolis School Superintendent you will find a multitude of stories such as this one:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re All Bozos on This Board<br>
After watching the last two superintendents it tabbed go up in smoke, what will the Minneapolis School Board do for an encore?</p>
<p>Published on February 08, 2006</p>
<p>When Thandiwe Peebles&rsquo;s tenure as superintendent of Minneapolis schools ended a couple of weeks ago, she</p>
<p>    *</p>
<p>blew out of town in much the same manner she had arrived in August 2004: abruptly, and amid secrecy and controversy over the workings &mdash;  not to mention the judgment &mdash; of the MPS Board of Education that hired her. In all, it took board members a grand total of 66 seconds to call their January 27 meeting to order, accept a much-negotiated letter of resignation from Peebles, who did not attend, and gavel the proceedings to a close.</p>
<p>The resignation, for which Peebles received a roughly $180,000 buyout, brought an end to 17 months of rancor and infighting at the troubled district. Shortly after she arrived, district employees had begun complaining that Peebles routinely ordered staff to perform personal tasks for her, such as driving her to McDonald&rsquo;s and walking her dog. Teachers and administrators complained that her style amounted to &#8220;shaming and blaming,&#8221; and accused the new super of terrorizing staff by calling them out at meetings and conducting surprise inspections. Before long district staffers were complaining directly to school board members. &#8220;All of us have heard different things,&#8221; board member Sharon Henry-Blythe told City Pages in October 2004. &#8220;We are listening very carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Peebles&rsquo;s seeming success at lowering the achievement gap between white and black students in the Minneapolis system did little to quell her critics. In the summer of 2005, spurred on by continuing staff discontent and leaks to Star Tribune reporter Steve Brandt, the board hired an investigator named Dennis O&rsquo;Brien to look into the matter. After receiving his report in mid-January, the board began negotiating with Peebles over the terms of her departure.</p>
<p>Following the one-minute meeting at which they accepted Peebles&rsquo;s resignation, the board held a press conference. A passel of Minneapolis DFL leaders, including Mayor R.T. Rybak and then-City Council Chair Paul Ostrow, filed in and formed a crescent flanking school board Chair Joseph Erickson at the podium. It was a difficult day, Erickson intoned. He then introduced former school board member Bill Green (who is also a colleague of Erickson&rsquo;s on the faculty of Augsburg College) as the interim superintendent, extolling Green&rsquo;s credentials and calling him &#8220;part of our family.&#8221; It was time to &#8220;heal&#8221; and &#8220;stabilize&#8221; the district, Erickson announced. He boasted that the termination of Peebles&rsquo;s contract had &#8220;only&#8221; cost the district $179,500, a figure substantially less than her contract called for in the event of her termination without cause. No, he told questioners, he could not discuss the reasons for Peebles&rsquo;s departure. According to the terms of the severance agreement passed out to reporters, both sides agreed not to disparage the other. The MPS will even keep a letter of recommendation for Peebles on file for her next job search. &#8220;We respect her right to confidentiality,&#8221; Erickson told the crowd, which consisted of numerous African American parents as well as assembled reporters. &#8220;It is of no interest to us to see her reputation sullied.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this, many of the black parents and advocates in the room erupted in derisive hoots.</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Fed Up&#8221; (responding to posts 27 and 28):</p>
<p>You make some interesting points.  However, the Flynn Effect shows that and IQ differences between the races are enviromental, not genetic:</p>
<p><br>
The Flynn effect<br>
Main article: Flynn effect<br>
The secular, international increase in test scores, commonly called the Flynn effect, is seen by Flynn and others as reason to expect the eventual convergence of average black and white IQ scores. Flynn argues that the average IQ scores in several countries have increased about 3 points per decade during the 20th century, which he and others attribute predominantly to environmental causes.[49] This means, given the same test, the mean performance of African Americans today could be higher than the mean for white Americans in 1920, though the gains causing this appear to have occurred predominantly in the lower half of the IQ distribution.[50] If an unknown environmental factor can cause changes in IQ over time, they argue, then contemporary differences between groups could also be due to an unknown environmental factor.</p>
<p>Nichols (1987)[51] critically summarized the argument as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We do not know what causes the test score changes over time. (2) We do not know what causes racial differences in intelligence. (3) Since both causes are unknown, they must, therefore, be the same. (4) Since the unknown cause of changes over time cannot be shown to be genetic, it must be environmental. (5) Therefore, racial differences in intelligence are environmental in origin (p. 234).</p>
<p>Flynn and other research have found reason to doubt the construct validity of secular increases in IQ scores.[52] In terms of the latent variables that IQ tests were designed to measure, such as g and verbal and mathematical ability, changes in IQ scores over time are different than either within-group individual differences and between group differences.[53] For example, there has been little increase over time in performance on either the forward digit-span or reverse digit-span subtests, and tests of school achievement have been less affected than tests of abstract reasoning.[54] At least one study has found that measurement bias contributes to the Flynn effect, which is not seen in black-white IQ differences.[55]</p>

		<p>Details matter. The Nigerian wunderkind mentioned in one of the posts if from a different class than those Africans whose kings sold them to Europeans several hundred years back. Africans - real Africans - routinely do better than native Whites.  Part of the reason may be self selection - African emigrants may be more entreprenuerial than there fellow Africnas, and more so than the host country White population. When some one starts to speak of blacks or Africans, it is important to known which cohort we are tracking.</p>

		<p>From the same wikipediua article, again, there is no evidence that gentics affects intelligence:</p>
<p>Molecular genetic studies<br>
The decoding of the human genome has enabled scientists to search for sections of the genome that contribute to cognitive abilities. Current studies using Quantitative trait loci have yielded little success in the search for genes influencing intelligence.</p>
<p>A 2005 literature review article on the links between race and intelligence in American Psychologist stated that no gene has been shown to be linked to intelligence, &#8220;so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time&#8221;.[6] Two 2007 studies found that DTNBP1 and CHRM2 appear to influence intelligence depending on which allele of it a person carries.[80][81] However, a study published in 2009 by Deary et al.. failed to find evidence of an association between these genes and general intelligence, stating &#8220;there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences&#8221;<br>

<p>Anonymous wtote  &#8220;&hellip; from a different class than those Africans whose kings sold them to Europeans several hundred years back &hellip; &#8220;</p>
<p>Maybe they were from a different class, but they were no less intelligent than anyone else.  African slaves, in fact, proved to be more knowledgeable and skilled in many areas than their masters.  For example:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the United States, colonial South Carolina and Georgia grew and amassed great wealth from the slave labor obtained from the Senegambia area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices, in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around Georgetown, Charleston, and Savannah. From the slaves, plantation owners learned how to dyke the marshes and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was milled by hand with wooden paddles, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by the slaves).&#8221;</p>

<p>Four brief points:</p>
<p>(1) Scientists have mapped the entire human genome and no gene can be located that affects intelligence (see Deary, et al 2009; cited above).</p>
<p>(2) The &#8220;twins reared apart&#8221; study does not refute the effect of environment on the development of IQ.  Even though they are reared apart, both environments may be similar, and therefore have a similar influence on development.</p>
<p>(3) On average, there is a 15% difference in genetic makeup from one individual to the next, even between persons of the same race.  Whereas racial characteristics alone make up less than 6% of the genetic variation in humans, it is possible that a white person may be genetically &#8220;closer&#8221; to a black person than other white people.</p>
<p>(4) Culture and environment are a HUGE factor.  For example, a white cardiologist who went to Harvard medical school and practices in an upper middle class suburban hospital has a lot more in common with a black cardiologist with the same education and experience than a white factory worker who dropped out of high school and lives in a rural area.</p>

		<p>17 Explain This: The existence of highly intelligent Blacks is no more evidence of intellectual equality between races than the existence of tall women is evidence of equality of stature between the sexes.  Of course there are a few intelligent Blacks, out of 800 million or so.  They are called statistical outliers, and are as relevant to the situation in the Minneapolis schools as are very quick and agile 5&rsquo;6&#8221; Whites to the NBA.</p>

		<p>32 Explain This: Regarding Nichols&rsquo; summary of the Flynn Effect, there seems to be a logical difficulty.<br>
    <br>
&#8220;(1) We do not know what causes the test score changes over time.  (2) We do not know what causes racial differences in intelligence.  (3) Since both causes are unknown, they must, therefore, be the same.&#8221;  <br>
     This is not reasoning, this is nonsense.  My engine smokes, and I don&rsquo;t know why.  My power windows don&rsquo;t work, and I don&rsquo;t know why.  Since I don&rsquo;t know the source of either problem, they must have the same cause?  Have epilepsy and diabetes, both mysteries at one time, been shown to have the same cause?</p>
<p>&#8220;(4) Since the unknown cause of changes over time cannot be shown to be genetic, it must be environmental.&#8221;<br>
     Allow me to deconstruct this sentence.  <br>
     The word &#8220;cannot&#8221; is simply invalid.  The worst that Nichols could honestly say is it HAS NOT been shown to be genetic, at least to his satisfaction.  Of course, since Nichols was writing in 1987, his knowledge of these matters is obsolete and irrelevant.  You might as well quote the Red Baron on supersonic flight.  <br>
     &#8220;&hellip;it must be environmental.&#8221;  That it purely an assumption.  Given that this assumption lies behind all educational theory and all the failed attempts to close the various gaps between Whites and Blacks, it might even be said that environmental causes CANNOT explain the differences in intelligence.  At the very least, it has to be said that the proponents of nurture over nature have been given every opportunity to make their case, and have consistently failed.  </p>

		<p>37 Anon: Four brief rebuttals.<br>
     (1) If the &#8220;scientists&#8221;, whoever they may be, have not located any genes that affect intelligence, they need to talk to the neurologists and look again.  There are a number of physiological attributes of the brain and of brain cells that affect its workings, such as the thickness of the myelin coating on neurons, or the proportions of grey matter and white matter.  As physiological traits, they are largely genetically determined, like skin color or fat distribution on the body.  Or would you suggest that everyone is born with the same, standard brain, which varies only according to environment?  Were it any organ besides the brain, no one would challenge a genetic explanation of the differences.<br>
     (2) The &#8220;twins reared apart&#8221; studies may have studied twins placed in similar environments.  May have, may have not.  If you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t honestly claim that the studies do not refute environmental explanations.  It&rsquo;s been awhile, but I recall that the researchers were astonished by the similarities of the separated twins.  They gave the same answers on a variety of standard psychological tests, and even made the same consumer choices, things like preferring tomato juice to orange, or smoking Chesterfield cigarettes.  In every aspect of behavior, the subjects had more in common with their twins than with their adoptive families.  Nature clearly trumped nurture.  <br>
     (3) &#8220;On average, there is a 15% genetic difference in genetic makeup from one individual to the next, even between individuals of the same race.&#8221;  Balderdash.  Humans and chimpanzees have 98 or 99 percent of their genetic makeup in common.  Somebody is lying to you, matching 15% of this 6% to 4% of that 53% or some such apples and oranges comparison.  <br>
     I&rsquo;ve read this story line before, usually concluding that a person might actually be closer genetically closer to a stranger of another race than to their own brother or sister.  That ought be a clue.  If somebody&rsquo;s calculations point to an absurd conclusion, then you ought be suspicious of their calculations rather than your own eyes.  <br>
     (4) &#8220;&hellip;a White cardiologist who went to Harvard&hellip;has a lot more in common with a Black with the same education and experience, than with a White factory worker who dropped out of high school&hellip;&#8221;  No doubt.  But, pretending for the moment that affirmative action does not exist, the White and Black cardiologists had a lot in common at birth, namely high intelligence.  Environment and culture may be HUGE, but they are not the only things that separate the White doctor from the White dropout.  Nurturing can only work on what nature provided.  </p>

<p>Would you at least agree with me, then, that statemwnts such as  &#8220;ALL blacks are this or that&#8221; or &#8220;ALL members of a certain race are this way or that way&#8221; has mo basis in fact?  That organizing one&rsquo;s thoughts based on such an assumption is faulty logic from the start?</p>
<p>(2) DNA CANNOT determine what race you are, therfore, you cannot make a genetic link between race and intelligence. &#8220;Mitchondrial markers (mtDNA haplogroups) were discovered first and have been well studied. Everyone carries them. They descend through the maternal line, passing from mother to daughter. Men get theirs from their mothers but cannot pass them on&hellip; . Why does this not tell your &#8220;race&#8221;? Because ten generations ago (around the year 1800) you had a thousand ancestors, only one of whom (your mother&rsquo;s, mother&rsquo;s, mother&rsquo;s &hellip;. mother) had that particular mtDNA. Your other 999 ancestors might all have had totally different ancestry.<br>

<p>That scientists claim they haven&rsquo;t located a gene for intelligence doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Twins reared apart shows that intelligence is largely inherited and therefore genetic. The conclusion from the study is that intelligence is 70% genetic and 30% environmental.</p>
<p>Environment and culture surely play a role in advancing or retarding intelligence. For example, had Issac Newton been born to a family of rural peasants, would his genius ever have been discovered or realized?</p>
<p>However, one can not take someone of low IQ and place him in a situation of environmental enrichment and then produce an Issac Newton. The genetics for intelligence have to be in place to produce a genius.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had decades of placing blacks in enrichment programs (Head Start is one such early enrichment program that has never produced any noticeable results) and we have yet to produce a great number of blacks with high IQs. If you know of such a program or study that has transform someone of moderate IQ to genius IQ, please let us know.</p>

<p>(1) There are inner city charter schools and private schools that refute this assumption, and they generally do it with much less funding than the typical, budget-bloated public school system.  Most students, regardless of background, will flourish, given the right environment.</p>
<p>(2) Also, what exactly is your definition of &#8220;blacks?&#8221;  There&rsquo;s no way to identify someone&rsquo;s race on a genetic level (see post #41).  Linking academic performance to superfluous, cosmetic differences such as skin color does not seem logical.  Linking academic performance to *environmental factors* (such as cultural bias and societal discrimination against individuals with a certain appearance or background) DOES seem logical.</p>
<p>(3) Additionally, academic performance alone is not necessarily a good measure of intelligence.  Albert Einstein (way above genius level with an IQ of 160) and the brilliant Thomas Edison were, at times, terrible students.</p>
