<h1>Kansas City District Once Flush With Cash Is So Broke Official Wants to Close Half Its Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Heather Hollingsworth, WDAF-TV (Kansas City), March 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kansas City was held up as a national example of bold thinking when it tried to integrate its schools by making them better than the suburban districts where many kids were moving. The result was one school with an Olympic-sized swimming pool and another with recording studios.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s on the brink of bankruptcy and considering another bold move: closing nearly half its schools to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Schools officials say the cuts are necessary to keep the district from plowing through what little is left of the $2 billion it received as part of a groundbreaking desegregation case.</p>
<p>Buffeted for years by declining enrollment, political squabbling and a revolving door of leadership, the district&rsquo;s fortunes are so bleak that Superintendent John Covington has said diplomas given to many graduates &#8220;aren&rsquo;t worth the paper they&rsquo;re printed on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kansas City is among the most striking examples of the challenges of saving urban school districts. The city used gobs of cash to improve facilities, but boosting lagging test scores and stemming the exodus of students were more elusive. Like other big-city districts, it finds itself struggling to become more than just the last resort for large pockets of poverty in the urban core.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest possible solution for Kansas City is the plan Covington submitted to the school board last week that called for closing 29 out of 61 schools to eliminate a projected $50 million budget shortfall. Covington also has said he wants to cut about 700 of the district&rsquo;s 3,000 jobs, including 285 teachers. The school board vote is Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year alone officials expect to overspend the $316 million budget by $15 million and if nothing changes, the district will be in the red by 2011.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kansas City appeared headed for a recovery when a federal judge in 1985 declared the district was unconstitutionally segregated. To boost test scores, integrate the schools and repair decrepit classrooms, the state was ordered to spend about $2 billion to address the problems.</p>
<p>The district went on a buying spree that included a six-lane indoor track and a mock court complete with a judge&rsquo;s chamber and jury deliberation room. But student achievement remained low, and the anticipated flood of students from the suburbs turned out to be more like a trickle. {snip}.</p>
<p>And to this day, the district continues to lose students. In the late 1960s enrollment peaked at 75,000, dropped to 35,000 a decade ago and now sits at just under 18,000.</p>
<p>Only about half of Kansas City&rsquo;s elementary school students and about 40 percent of middle and high school students now attend the city&rsquo;s public schools. Many of the other students have left for publicly funded charter schools, private and parochial schools and the suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the height of spending in 1991-92, Kansas City invested more than $11,700 per student  &mdash;  more than double that year&rsquo;s national average of $5,001, according to U.S. Census figures. Today, the district spends an average of $15,158 on each student, compared to a national average of $9,666 in 2006-07, the latest figures available.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Kansas City is still running the buildings, many schools have an empty feel. Several classrooms sit vacant, many hallways are sparse with students and some teachers have a dozen or fewer students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Covington has faulted previous school leaders for failing to act as enrollment shrunk. Past administrators proposed closures, but the plans were either scaled back or scrapped entirely after community protests.</p>

		<p>I think the difference between Kansas City and St. Louis is that St. Louis city&rsquo;s system has been gradually closing and merging schools for as long as I&rsquo;ve been coherent, while KC is going to close about half its schools in one fell swoop.  St. Louis does have one public high school, geared toward elite and college prep students, that attracts suburban whites, but KC does not have such a school.  Also, it appears that far many more KC students use schools other than public, compared to St. Louis.</p>

<p>Just another example of the myth of &#8216;underfunded&rsquo; inner-city schools, something I have learned about mainly or wholly here at Amren.  I&rsquo;ll bet some of the best schools only spend around the average amount or less.</p>

<p>Yes, and the same thing will be said about the entire country in a few years.</p>
<p>This was to be the great multiracial experiment to show the world that it is possible to achieve a first rate utopia.</p>

		<p>Kansas City schools can solve their problems by simply spending more money.  Also, part of the problem is that there are not enough teachers who look like the student to whom they are teaching to. They need to hire pretty much all People of Color teachers. Then, the students will be inspriationalized and do better.  How would you like it if all of your teachers were people of a color who did not look like your color? How could you learn?</p>

		<p>That story is absolutely sickening and painful to read. When you look at the massive waste of money and how those funds could have been used to facilitate the education of bright and worthy high-achieving white students you can see America&rsquo;s downfall. </p>
<p>Any AR reader - or like-minded individual - could have predicted the outcome in 1990. How many times does this have to be repeated before it finally sinks in that test scores will never rise for blacks no matter how many fancy gymnasiums or electronic gizmos are on school grounds. </p>
<p>So now there is no money left for anyone. How this legalized stupidity and lack of common sense became law is the greatest mystery of all. And to be honest, the black students would probably have done better if they were put in a small room and drilled with the basics of math and English and taught work habits. Instead, they were put in the middle of what became a carnival of overpaid, incompetent &#8220;educators,&#8221; administrators, and diversity-loving liberals completely out of touch with reality. <br>

		<p>All urban (black) districts go through a constant cycling of the latest plan to improve educational results. Cleveland is currently unveiling a new plan to improve the schools. When these plans fail, the Superintendents&rsquo; contract is bought out, a new black educator is installed after a lengthy search, and the process is repeated. This will go on forever. </p>

		<p>Historical note: In 1985, when the Federal judge trashed the Kansas state government and the constitution, there was a Republican president and a Republican majority in the senate. The Republican president could have refused to implement the judge&rsquo;s decree without fear of being removed from office by impeachment. The Republican president of course did nothing to stop this ecroachment of power by the Federal judges. </p>
<p>Just one more example of the foolishness of supporting the Republican party.</p>

<p>err.. vice versa, its impossible to take the jungle out of the black</p>
<p>they need to introduce the notion of COMPETITION. Dumb and agressive students (currently about 90% of inner city blacks) should be sent to prison like high schools and tought how to be food workers and street cleaners. bottom 85%</p>
<p>Less violent but still marginal dumb students should apply for and compete to get into a nicer school that has great cafeteria food, nice gyms and sports, and home ec courses top 4-15%</p>
<p>smarter kids should get a crack at going to the one elite school with real teachers and AP courses and rigourous learning, with the best science facilities, arts, and music (top 3%)</p>

		<p>Here I go again with an opinion that will never be read or even at least acknowledged by the annual 6-figure looters of the public education monopoly:</p>
<p>White and Asian kids do not want to get the hell beaten out of them by blacks who will prey on them going to and from, and while in, school.  Blacks are too violent. Get it? </p>
<p>Responsible White and Asian parents support their children in this rejection of the certain abuse that is the reality when going to school with blacks. </p>
<p>As well, the White and Asian kids don&rsquo;t want to see their assailants happily walking the halls a short time after the assault on them. </p>
<p>Then there is the lowering of standards that is all too common in black-dominated school districts.  Check out the AMREN article in regard to Detroit schools new super-duperintendant. The man is functionally illiterate, but the brutha has a smooth rap which makes him, in the eyes of his black tribal members, good enough for the job. </p>
<p>So the taxpayers dumped a ton of cash to put in nifty new fun rooms and athletic stuff in the Kansas City schools.  It&rsquo;s a nation-wide pattern which amounts to putting perfume on a pig. </p>
<p>Black kids on the whole are too dangerous and othewise violent to be around.  Nobody with any common sense will go to school with them.     </p>

		<p>Ha, ha, I lived in KC for 2.5 years while in my seminary program.  KC is no different than any other area of the midwest or south.  Whites and Asians send their kids to private schools, or homeschool them.  That leaves the blacks and the Mexicans in the public schools.  I think they&rsquo;d be a LOT better off to simply admit that this is how it is, and just keep the blacks all together with black teachers, and ditto with the Mexicans with Mexican teachers.  They learn better with each other, exactly the way whites and Asians do.  Ross Barnett was right:  cows don&rsquo;t integrate with pigs; horses don&rsquo;t integrate with sheep - what are we THINKING of, trying to force our unfortunate kids into integration of the races?  The values are different, the culture is different, they mind-sets are different - why not &#8220;vive la difference&#8221; and let it be?  Betcha the test scores&rsquo;d go up&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well, what an incredible story-packed with plenty of seemingly legitimate statistics too tempting to ignore debate.</p>
<p>Do you realize that one thousand million dollars equals a billion dollars? These people received two thousand million dollars to help them with their schools. Wow.</p>
<p>Although some of it was probably spent a little too extravagantly (c&rsquo;mon, with that much dough, even I would have a little fun going overboard!), it seems they tried to do the right things, and I believe they did for the most part.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s skip the rest and get to the bottom line. It all comes down to how a kid is raised and what value system he or she is taught. All the money, all the effort &mdash; and honestly, again, I can&rsquo;t blame the school system that much, or at least not as much as the parents, who themselves too often lack some of the most basic, down-to-earth, common sense attributes, such as DISCIPLINE AND SELF-SACRIFICE &mdash; are of little value if the root of the problem lies within the individual child who can&rsquo;t help himself or herself and is highly resistant and/or reluctant to change. We all know quite well that if you don&rsquo;t have just a few of these fundamental ideals going for you, chances are, you&rsquo;re just not going be very successful. And if you ain&rsquo;t got it, what in the hell do have to offer your kids? There must be a social conscience instilled; else, the dominant trait will be that of a societal outcast ruled by both a damaging self-consciousness and relentless, defiant behavior. It leaves me asking the same question that&rsquo;s been asked over and over by so many, &ldquo;What is wrong with the majority of black people?&rdquo; I guess the answer is obvious. And sad.</p>

<p>I would very much like to see a list of those figures for each state. It would doubtless be very enlightening -  but certainly nothing we Amreners couldn&rsquo;t already guess.  <br>
I&rsquo;ll bet a state like Maine spends somewhere near the bottom in dollars and gets somewhere near the top in results.  I wonder why?</p>

<p>Not really a mystery when you realize that Diversity has become enshrined as America&rsquo;s new state religion.  A secular religion.  When you understand it as a religion, then you realize that it is not subject to the same scrutiny and logic that would apply otherwise to any other project, as if it were a business proposal that would need to justity itself.  But a religion is based upon BELIEF and FAITH, and true believers do not require to see proof of their beliefs. They just KNOW they are right.   (In fact, if you dare suggest otherwise, you are a blasphemer and a heretic!)</p>

I suppose that  Superindentent John Covington  is one of that &#8220;carnival&#8221; mentioned above.  I&rsquo;d be curious to know just how much he has been getting paid, during this period when his schools were failing and the city was going broke.</p>

		<p>There is more to this massive failure than the article lets on.  These schools didn&rsquo;t just have olympic-sized swimming pools and recording studios, they were equipped with:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.planetariums, olympic-size swimming pools with underwater observation windows, dust-free diesel mechanics rooms, at least one mock-United Nations wired for simultaneous interpretation, radio and television studios capable of real broadcasting, video editing and animation labs, a moot court complete with jury room and judges chambers, a model Greek village to teach participatory democracy, elementary schools with one personal computer for every two children.</p>
<p>There were German- and French-language elementary schools staffed with native speakers. The former coach of the Soviet Olympic fencing team was hired  &mdash;  along with an interpreter  &mdash;  to teach the finer points of sword play&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if all of had been destroyed by blacks within one year.</p>
<p>The belief was that Whites would flock back to inner-city black schools which would cause black test scores to rise as conventional wisdom states that blacks can only learn if they are surrounded by Whites. </p>
<p>These luxury items, used to raise black test scores, were funded via judicial fiat:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The $1.4 billion came from Judge Clark [who] raised it through two astonishing acts of judicial dictatorship. In 1987, he unilaterally raised Kansas City property taxes, first from 2.05 percent to four percent and eventually 4.96 percent  ignoring an amendment to the Missouri constitution that requires a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise property taxes past 3.25 percent. </p>
<p>In penance for the past crime of  [restrictive covenants in deeds], the state was forced to pay more than $800 million&hellip; the state attorney general repeated contested this exaction, but lost every court battle&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydksdwo" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ydksdwo</a></p>
<p>The results?  Did White children flock back to black schools because of all the amenities?  Were black test scores raised?  No and No.  There wasn&rsquo;t even a Pyrrhic  victory, nothing but massive amounts of wasted tax dollars and utter failure. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Now [the school district] on the brink of bankruptcy and considering another bold move: closing nearly half its schools to stay afloat.</p>
<p> Superintendent John Covington has said diplomas given to many graduates &#8216;aren&rsquo;t worth the paper they&rsquo;re printed on.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the question taxpayers demand:  Was anyone held responsible for this massive fiasco and ultimate failure?</p>
<p>You can bet the answer is no.</p>

		<p>The $15,000 and $20,000 per student which these failing school systems are spending is more than it costs to attend many private schools. At the same time, home schools, which outperform both public and private schools, cost about $500 per year on average. Despite all of the money it&rsquo;s costing, the public school system isn&rsquo;t safe and doesn&rsquo;t begin to provide education. </p>

		<p>I think this is the same schoo&rsquo; district that the federal judge took over. He basically made all the important decisions. Did the same thing in Rockford Il. After all, Rockford is such a hot bed of discrimination.</p>
<p>The end result of educating students is about the same as if nothing had been done. And the decent tax payers find their real estate taxes jacked up so high they all flee in a few years, leaving a tax base of indigents.</p>
<p>OH, and any complaints about the program were considered to be CONTEMPT OF COURT WITH POSSIBLE JAIL TIME!! So sayeth the judge.</p>

		<p>There are two upsides to all of this:</p>
<p>(1) It has been proven definitively that spending on education  &mdash;  above a reasonable amount needed to provide essential facilities and services  &mdash;  does not produce better students. When such extravagant facilities are provided for blacks, the only tangible result  &mdash;  without exception  &mdash;  is a money pit that &#8220;students&#8221; vandalize and eventually destroy.</p>
<p>(2) All young people in this country with a modicum of intelligence have a strong incentive to do their best in school and achieve success. Indeed, one measure of success in this society is how little an individual is forced to spend his/her life coming into contact with blacks.</p>

		<p>Governments no longer have the money to keep trying to make sows ears into silk purses.  Schools will continue to deteriorate and close, and teachers will be fired because their students can&rsquo;t magically be made smart.  In time, such substandard schools, with their substandard teachers, will become like the old black schools of the South.  The majority of ghetto youth may not even bother to attend.<br>

		<p>As a resident of the KC metro area and a landlord I can attest to the poor quality of the KC public school system.  Homes in the KC school district are much harder to rent and the school district is often the main factor in a rental decision. The school district is often the first question of a potential renter. Kansas City has a large and fairly nasty ghetto but also a number of more upscale areas.  Anyone living in the better areas would not even consider sending children to a public school.  </p>

I don&rsquo;t care if the school was solid gold and offered limousines for student transportation with a 5 star chef lunch.</p>
<p>I would still send my child to the private school I do now.<br>
They do not have all the fancy bells and whistles and deliberately use very outdated textbooks to avoid the history rewrites so common in new textbooks.</p>
<p>What they do have is performance, and one of the reasons for it is keeping out the riff raff.</p>

		<p>Listen to the way the argument goes:</p>
<p>1.  Blacks and Latinos are historically discriminated against.  Oh, wait a minute, nearly all Latinos just got here in the last 20 years so they cannot really be included in some legacy of discrimination.</p>
<p>2.  Focusing just on blacks then, there were so many laws that discriminated against them, they never had a chance to develop fully.  Oh, wait a minute, nearly all those segregation laws were in the south.  All the big discrimination and A/A lawsuits are happening in the north, especially in out of the way places like Kansas, Minnesota or Massachusetts.  So the states that fought to free the slaves, and who only saw big influxes of blacks in the last 50 years, cannot really be blamed like that.</p>
<p>3.  Blacks are discriminated against in housing.  Well, &#8220;if you got no money, how&rsquo;s you gonna buy yourself a house?&#8221;  Many whites cannot live in nice middle class neighborhoods either.</p>
<p>4.  Black kids do poorly in school because they have low self esteem because white people are discriminating against them.  In most schools where there&rsquo;s lots of blacks, there are few whites.  How are those few whites holding the blacks down?  Is it the teachers?  Most teachers love their students regardless of racial differences, and besides, the schools have been flooded with huge numbers of liberal white &#8220;social justice&#8221; types for the last decade.</p>
<p>5.  Oh, so they need more money to educate them because they learn in special ways?  In many urban, black district, the per pupil spending is nearly double what white kids get in the suburbs.  How much more money do you need?  Haiti has been independent and under all black rule for over 200 years.  They haven&rsquo;t made any good progress.  How long should we wait for blacks here to improve?</p>

		<p>I went to school before they desegregated, class of 1965 in a small Texas town.  I think the USA peaked in test scores that year or the next, then desegregation set in and test scores began their descent to today&rsquo;s mediocracy .</p>
<p>Anyway, we played the black school each year in sports and always won, but as Am Reners know, because of blacks early physical development, they were two years worth of growth, development and size ahead of us.  They really didn&rsquo;t care about winning as much as beating hell out of us, the roughing penalties<br>
were the winning difference.  But they were trying to injure us. </p>
<p>This was the telling moment for me as I was going up against guys several inches taller and 35-50 lbs bigger than me who were out to hurt me as opposed to win the game.  </p>
<p>The problem with integration is not just the aggressive additude of the blacks, who want to rule the roost, but the fact that they are two years bigger and more developed than white kids.  I was an athlete and I was a little intimidated, just as I was intimidated when the sophomore &#8220;B&#8221; team had to go up against the Senior-laden first string.  I can imagine how the non-athletic Asians and geeks felt.  </p>
<p>Also, the blacks go aggressively after our young white girls with rape or near raping tactics.  The girls are shy and inexperienced plus brainwashed not to discriminate so they are easy prey.  The administrators and police are so cowed, they close their eyes as each new class of girls are essentially raped and put into bondage.  Just go to any strip club and see how many of these girls turn their money over to their &#8216;Stripclub Pimp&#8221; boyfriends, almost all black.</p>

<p>Why am I not surprised.</p>
<p>I LA, where I work, during the 1990s, the district decided to build a $200 million state-of-the-art high school in an area  populated heavily by illegal immigrants from mexico and central americans.  </p>
<p>Guess they were trying to compete with Kansas City.</p>
<p>Yeah, break our country&rsquo;s laws and you and your illegal children are rewarded with a taxpayer- funded Rolls Royce school while the schools in &#8216;wealthy&rsquo; areas are miserably broken down and in deplorable condition  &mdash;   the asphalt on the playgrounds broken, &#8216;busted&rsquo; heaters and air conditioners,  deteriorating classrooms with broken linoleum and ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>I should know, I&rsquo;ve worked in a number of such schools where repairs can take years, if ever.</p>
<p>This &#8216;most expensive high school ever&rsquo; was almost completed when it was discovered that it had been built on top of an old oil field with escaping methane gas!  You can imagine the liability.  Anyone who ever attended this school and got sick, no matter how many eons later, would be in a position to sue the &#8216;deep pocketed&rsquo; school district (and win) claiming the toxic gases caused their illnesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Los Angeles Unified School District board wrestled with ways to solve the problem of methane seeping through the earth at its half-completed Belmont Learning Complex site just west of downtown.</p>
<p>Faced with intractable environmental problems and spiraling costs to treat them, school officials here voted today to abandon their $200 million effort to build a high school in one of this city&rsquo;s most densely populated neighborhoods. Built atop a toxic oil field, the school would have been the most expensive high school in the United States&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>So reports the LA Times.</p>
<p>The district decided to weather proof this monstrosity and let it lie fallow as the idiots on the school board decided what to do.  I drove past this monster for five years on my daily commute and shook my head every time I looked at it wondering how it would play out.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Los Angeles has now officially opened its $350 million downtown high school the Edward R. Roybal Learning Center. It is only a decade over due and more than the operating budgets of some small nations. </p>
<p>The cost overruns are due to a series of moronic decisions by school officials from citing to environmental issues. The plan includes a $17 million toxic gas mitigation system that will cost $250,000 a year to operate&hellip; Vents around the school will allow underground methane and hydrogen sulfide gases escape. When sensors detect gas buildup, a blower will push out the gases. They later found an active earthquake fault under the site&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>An investigation by the county district attorney&rsquo;s office, the city attorney and the California attorney general found no criminal wrongdoing, just incredibly poor management  &mdash;  though most responsible officials escaped any real disciplinary action. In 2003 District Attorney Steve Cooley called the project &#8216;a public works disaster of biblical proportions.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>No one held responsible.  No criminal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Why am I not surprised?</p>

I understand that my old high school now stands empty and unused.  I know that it had been designated as a Charter School at one time, and that blacks were bused there for classes.

<p>Kansas City schools can solve their problems by simply spending more money. Also, part of the problem is that there are not enough teachers who look like the student to whom they are teaching to. They need to hire pretty much all People of Color teachers. Then, the students will be inspriationalized and do better. How would you like it if all of your teachers were people of a color who did not look like your color? How could you learn?&#8221;</p>
<p>What kind of question is that? Do you actually think that my learning ( high school, university and post.doc) has anything what so ever, to do with the skin color of my teachers??  On the other hand, my skin color, has probably everything to say. You see, I happen to be white..blond&hellip;with blue eyes.. I&rsquo;ve been in situations with white teachers, yellow teachers, no teachers, internet teachers, and I&rsquo;ve done my PhD.  I can not comprehend the stupidity behind the question by anonymous: &#8220;How would you like it if all of your teachers were people of a color who did not look like your color?

<p>I think 4 Anonymous was being sarcastic.  However, all of my math teachers in high school that I had for math classes that my HS had were black, and somehow it didn&rsquo;t preclude me (or any of the other students, black, white or others) from learning geometry, trig, college algebra and calculus.  Counting middle school, only one of my math teachers was white.  Once I started taking math in college, including one course while still in HS, my profs were all white, the assistant profs being mostly white, and the graduate assistants were about evenly split between white, Indian and Oriental.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that they spent $350 million on a school, and then called it a &#8220;learning center.&#8221;  Might as well name it &#8220;Martin Luther King, Jr. Ghetto High School for Future Criminals.&#8221; </p>
<p>Both of my children attended private schools, but if I had been forced by financial circumstances to live in an inner city, I would have chosen an old, run-down campus with a name like &#8220;Roosevelt&#8221; or &#8220;Coolidge&#8221; rather than a fabulous new facility called &#8220;Cesar Chavez Magnet School of Excellence,&#8221; etc.  High school only lasts for four years, but having to admit to graduating from a &#8220;learning center&#8221; lasts forever, as you will have to list it on applications and resumes.  Being able to claim that you were &#8220;homeschooled&#8221; or having a GED would have greater social cachet than a diploma from a school with a name that identifies it as being in an all-minority &#8216;hood.</p>
<p>My elder daughter&rsquo;s first summer job was as a checker at a local supermarket.  They hired about 8 people at the same time, and had them report for orientation.  All were high school kids, or very recent graduates.  My daughter and one other girl from a different private school were immediately started as checkers, while the others from public school were started at lower pay as stock clerks.  I was VERY surprised that kids with ZERO work experience would be treated so differently.  Both private school girls were white, the public school kids were a mixture.  I would have expected a grocery chain store to have some sort of Affirmative Action policy, but they made their decision based on either on a perception of better education, or a hope that private school girls wouldn&rsquo;t let their &#8220;friends&#8221; through the checkout without paying for each and every item.</p>

Historical note: In 1985, when the Federal judge trashed the Kansas state government and the constitution, </p>

<p>I lived in KCMO for several years and was somewhat involved in working with the area&rsquo;s youth.  Not one of the schools is worth attending.  Not one.  The district&rsquo;s accreditation was taken away by the state in 1999.  It has never regained full accreditation.</p>
<p>The suburban schools aren&rsquo;t much better   &mdash;   not much, but they are better (observe standardized test results for the area via Greatschools.net).  I recall a conversation I had with a friend of mine who overheard me discussing the poor state of education in the Northland.  She proudly told me her mother taught at one of the best schools in Missouri.  I asked which, then we walked over to a computer and checked out the school&rsquo;s ratings via the link above.  They had something close to a 50% standardized test failure rate.  This says much about the area&rsquo;s attitude toward education: Halfway there is cause to celebrate, not cause to keep working.</p>
