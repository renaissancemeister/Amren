<h1>US Customs: Mexican Cartels Corrupt Border Agents</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Sherman, Google News, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican drug cartels are infiltrating federal law enforcement agencies along the southwest border and those charged with weeding them out say they don&rsquo;t have the money to catch all the corrupt agents, homeland security officials told a U.S. Senate panel Thursday.</p>
<p>James Tomsheck, assistant commissioner with U.S. Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s Office of Internal Affairs, told a Senate homeland security subcommittee in Washington that only about one in 10 of the new hires for agency jobs are given polygraph tests, and of those, 60 percent are deemed unsuitable for employment.</p>
<p>That means that many who joined the agency during the recent hiring boom and did not take polygraphs could have joined with corruption already in mind, Tomsheck said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported last year that four applicants for border protection jobs were not hired when polygraph tests and background checks confirmed they were infiltrators from drug trafficking operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transnational criminal organizations are doing all they can to infiltrate CBP through our hiring initiatives,&#8221; Tomsheck told the subcommittee.</p>
<p>An AP investigation tallied corruption-related convictions against more than 80 enforcement officials at all levels  &mdash;  federal, state and local  &mdash;  along the southwest border since 2007.</p>
<p>Since 2003, 129 customs officers and Border Patrol agents have been arrested on corruption charges, said Tom Frost, the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s assistant inspector general for investigations. That figure included the northern border and other ports of entry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found the tactics used by the drug trafficking organizations in their corruption activities are similar to the processes or tactics used by foreign intelligence services as they attempt to recruit or otherwise compromise our officers and agents,&#8221; Frost said. The corruption activities &#8220;encompass almost every layer of the DHS border security strategy,&#8221; including employees stationed away from the border, but with access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the agency will also face the challenge of doing the required five-year re-investigations of 19,000 employees whose evaluations will be overdue. Tomsheck estimated they would be able to do about half of them and noted that for budget reasons they had recently furloughed 99 people with law enforcement backgrounds who did the investigations. He asked Pryor to consider legislation that would give his office the authority to make polygraph tests part of the periodic re-investigations.</p>
<p>He said his goal was to eventually have continuous monitoring, &#8220;the never-ending background investigation, if you will.&#8221;<br>

<p>When significant numbers of Border Patrol agents have Spanish surnames, could anyone imagine some might have duplicitous motives, or be corruptable?</p>

		<p>It would be more surprising if it were otherwise.  The Mexican gang guys can offer the border agents their lives PLUS money   &mdash;   it can&rsquo;t be all that much fun down there at the border, and the agents doubtless value their own skins AND they need money like everybody else.  I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right - just that it&rsquo;s understandable.  I hope they ARE able to stop it.</p>

<p>Ranger, it&rsquo;s simply AMAZING that we hear NOTHING of the obvious likelyhood of this horrible scenario. Just think of it. Politicians live to keep in office, to keep the gravy train rolling. There are hundreds of millions (billions?) of dollars in the Mexican drug industry. They undoubtedly influence and/ or control low-level cops, politicians, etc. Why would the bribes stop at the local level. Natinal politicians believe they are invinceable, and untouchable. They may imagine they can take the money and run. They may learn that Mexi-thugs are willing to take their extreme violence to the usa, and start blowing up judges, politicians, cops, etc. What a nightmare!<br>
But what a pill for the open borders traitors to swallow. all their blather about the infeasibility and inhumanity of immigration enforcement, whilst (mostly) maintaining that Muslims in far-flung lands pose a real danger to us. And what would they do if Mexican narco-terrorists started lopping off heads in the good old USA? It may not be far off.<br>
Of all the terrible thing to happen, THIS could make politicians suddenly snap to attention, kick out the illegals, seal the borders, and clean house.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a simple solution to this corruption.  You rotate your border agents.  It is the same in every organization.  If you suspect corruption you change teams of agents at intervals.  This way the bad guys are kept off balance when they see new agents.  But of course the best way is to hire good people.  The Border Agents pay well.  I understand about $ 60 - $ 70 K per year.  With these kinds of salaries, corruption should be minimal.  With the economy at 10 % unemployment the Border Patrol can be very selective in who they hire.  Unofficial unemployment is about 17 % so it would see that corruption would not be that high.  </p>

		<p>There is a solution to the threats of narco-Mexicans, but it&rsquo;s not for sissies.<br>
     Many years ago, one of the narco-terror gangs that infested Lebanon kidnapped a Russian for ransom.  Instead of paying up like Western governments, the Soviets had the brother of the chief extortionist castrated.  I believe that this was the only time somebody tried to play that game with the Russians.  While it is illegal for American military forces to enforce the law in America, popping over the border for a visit is just what they&rsquo;re trained for.  Or for that matter, just what those armed drones are good for.  </p>

		<p>Build the wall and put the military on the border. Of course they&rsquo;re too busy trying to keep them (terrorists) out in Afghanistan when all a terrorist would have to do is walk across the Mexican border, I&rsquo;m sure many terrorists already have.</p>

		<p>Concerned Border Patrol Agents have long been aware of possible gang infiltration into the ranks.  With recent emphasis on so many Spanish speaking recruits, this becomes even more likely now.  And, if ordinary street bangers are successful,there is nothing to prevent &#8220;clean&#8221; members of highly organized cartels from joining up.   </p>
<p>Not only can cartels successfully infiltrate at the lower ranks, they can buy influence among senior management as well.  I suspect this has already happened.  An illustration is the Ramos and Compean arrest, trial, conviction and subsequent release from prison.  This whole thing smelled of bribes, payoffs, and threats orchestrated by the cartels in Mexico with their huge resources. </p>
<p>Representative Sylvester Reyes in whose district the incident occurred, did absolutely nothing to ensure justice in the case.   Besides being a typical worm of a Democrat, he was formally the El Paso Sector Chief.  <br>
  <br>
While the Border Patrol has degenerated recently after its takeover by the absolutely worthless Customs and Border Protection (CBP), I suspect that most of those agents referenced in the article are CBP Inspectors.  Inspectors work at the ports of entry and Border Agents work between the ports.</p>
<p>The last statistics I saw showed that around ninety percent of those convicted were CBP Inspectors.  This is not surprising since the recruiting and training for Inspectors is abysmal.  </p>
<p>CBP boiled it all down to a numbers game; push as many inspectors through as possible and forget quality training and adequate background checks.  One reason CBP must recruit so heavily is that once new hires hit the ports they soon realize they are working for a Gestapo management cabal.  A few quit on the spot and others immediately begin looking for a new job or agency. <br>
 <br>
The Border Patrol is its own worst enemy.   Management has two stock answers for everything:</p>
<p>1.  &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t work&rdquo;, and  <br>
2.   &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the funds.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
Examples:</p>
<p>1. build a border fence.  Management answer: &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t work, we don&rsquo;t have the funds&rdquo;<br>
2. use the NG as eyes and ears. Management answer: &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;<br>
3. use a volunteer civilian corps to act as eyes and ears. Management answer: &ldquo;too much trouble, won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;<br>
4. give lie detector tests to all recruits, Management answer: &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have the funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did find the money for a new toy however.  This being the border drone aircraft which cost around $30-$40 million. For this they could have hired sufficient guards to link hands all along the border. </p>
<p>By the way, the emphasis on Spanish speaking agents is merely a dodge to overwhelm the BP with Hispanics.  It becomes a tool to weed out Anglo recruits.  True, many non-Spanish speakers do enter the BP and are put through a less than successful Spanish training course.  </p>
<p>But the kicker is that for Anglos to get accepted, they must show an aptitude for language learning as predicted on a phony test, or be able to prove they can speak Spanish.  These techniques knock out a lot of white recruits.  </p>
<p>Some Spanish is needed to do the job but not much more than survival phrases and perhaps a few interview questions.  There are a lot of white cops working all along the Mexican border and they get by ok with minimal Spanish.  </p>
<p>Thanks to George Bush it makes no difference anyway since he saw to it that control over the Mexican border became a dead issue.  BP agents and CBP Inspectors now have a new mission. That being to intercept drugs coming north and confiscate (steal) large sums of money and guns going south.    <br>

<p>Not true, they offered me $50,000 as an agent!!! I already make WAYYY more than that. I am also tri-lingual, just not Spanish.</p>

		<p>Of course, the BP is corrupt, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they&rsquo;re corrupt or not, because the cartels will eventually gain complete control of the border well into the US.  They have a very strong foothold right now.  If we suffer greater economic drops, it will help them immensely.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that if the cartels unite and finally takeover Mexico, at the same time they will be increasing their strength into the US even more than their present influence.  They&rsquo;re aware that the US will move against Mexico if they start running things out in the open, and they want control of the US teritory as far into the interior as they can get in order to effectively repel any kind of ground invasion when it occurs.  By having so many Mexicans living in the Southwest, they can also start military operations there which could well put US forces in a vice from the South and North.  Certainly guerilla warfare will begin in the Southwest.</p>
<p>The present economic decline in the US is allowing the cartels the benefit of being more financially powerful than either Mexico or the US.</p>
<p>The only thing that will stop cartel takeover is by legalizing drugs and taking the profit out of them, just as was done with alcohol. </p>
<p>Eventually the deteriorating economic catastrophe will force the US to legalize drugs in order to acquire more tax revenue in order to try and halt bankruptcy of the fed as well as individual states.</p>
