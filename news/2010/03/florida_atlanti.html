<h1>Florida Atlantic University Officals Shut Down and Harass YAF Campus Organizers for Discussing Liberal Bias on Campus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Young Americans for Freedom, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 4, 2010</p>
<p>CONTACT: Jordan@yaf.com; 202-596-7923</p>
<p>Boca Raton, FL  &mdash;  On Wednesday March 3, 2010, at 5:20 PM Florida Atlantic University (FAU) campus officials shut down and called campus police on four FAU students and an alumnus to stop an informational meeting about starting a conservative organization on campus.</p>
<p>James Schackleford, an FAU student, saw a need for a conservative club on campus and decided to start a Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) chapter. Shackelford hosted an informational meeting with FAU alum and Florida YAF State Director Daniel P. Diaz to discuss future YAF activities on campus as well as around the state. While Diaz was speaking at the informational meeting, David Blank, a university administrator, asked the group to leave the room. Diaz asked Blank for fifteen minutes to finish speaking and Blank politely agreed to allow the group to finish its meeting. Upon hearing Diaz address the liberal bias on the FAU campus, Blank stopped the meeting again and boorishly ordered the students to vacate the meeting room. Blank the shut off the room lights, tore down the group&rsquo;s promotional posters, and called the campus police.</p>
<p>Ben Buck, an FAU student at the meeting said, &#8220;We were sitting in a peaceful meeting, just discussing a new organization, when we were approached by an administrator asking us to leave based on the content of our discussion regardless of previous verbal permission to talk on public property.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the students and Diaz were leaving campus FAU police detained and interrogated the group. Shackelford and Diaz were ordered to drop their meeting materials and to present identification. Diaz asked if they had broken any laws. The officer said, &#8220;we are investigating a possible trespassing charge and that is why we need to see your identification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officer Lieutenant Irving of FAU police, the third officer to arrive on the scene, upon Diaz&rsquo;s request, allowed Diaz to leave and had an officer follow Diaz to his car. As Diaz was leaving, Lieutenant Irving commented to a fellow officer [referring to Diaz] &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that guy probably has tea bags hanging out the back of his car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diaz said, &#8220;If we were a Marxist, Socialist or Liberal group they would have let us finish our meeting, but the university officials and police harassed us because we are conservatives.&#8221; Diaz added, &#8220;This was the exact liberal bias on campus that I was discussing in the meeting that these future YAFers experienced firsthand. The university is no longer a place of open discussion and freedom of expression, but a breeding ground of intolerance for conservative beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>YAF is the nation&rsquo;s oldest and most recognized conservative / libertarian youth activist organization. Founded on September 11, 1960, in Sharon, Connecticut at the home of William F. Buckley, Jr., YAF is a non-profit organization engaged in advocating public policies and activism consistent with The Sharon Statement. For more information call YAF&rsquo;s national headquarters at 202-596-7923 or our visit our website at www.yaf.com.</p>

<p>The reason that school officials (and others) do not bother the Leftists is because they know that the Leftists will fight back.  Conservatives don&rsquo;t.  </p>

		<p>This is absolutely reprehensible.  National publicity should be given to this university for such an outrage.  At lease make sure it&rsquo;s reported on FOX News - more Americans will see it there than on any other channel anyway!  Students have an absolute right to have a conservative group; this university&rsquo;s actions should not be tolerated.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see how the university can justify this. </p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t make it to court, there&rsquo;s no hope.</p>
<p>I hope the YAF has a few high achieving suits in their rank.</p>

		<p> The name of the organization I&rsquo;m thinking of escapes me, but there is one that specializes in legal defenses of conservative organizations which are the victims of P.C. run amok on campuses and elsewhere. I&rsquo;d suggest that YAF get in touch with that organization post haste, because I think they have a good case here.</p>
<p> Can anyone come up with the name of that group, that has temporarily fled from this aging brain of mine? If not that will bug me the rest of the evening!</p>

		<p>And just what did you expect? I can only assume that this Diaz person was there to pick a fight that, admittedly, could lead to something useful. However, any experienced conservative that has spent any time on a college campus should know what to expect if they try and start a conservative club of any sort.</p>

		<p>This unfortunate event is just begging for a lawsuit. The ACLU won&rsquo;t touch it, but if I were the members of this group, I would seek the counsel of David Horowitz or FIRE. Do a deep study of campus group guidelines and if they can&rsquo;t get anywhere, start using social media to get the word out and especially target the alumni. I&rsquo;m sure some of them would be very interested in knowing their alma mater was so discriminatory and hateful.</p>

<p>Fify years ago!   And we can see all the good it has achieved. The Buckley approach is too meek, too mild, too gentlemanly   &mdash;   just a dilettantish diversion.  Obviously a new approach is needed.  </p>
<p>By their fruits shall ye know them.</p>
<p>Good luck to you, Mr. Diaz;  but try getting some new ideas   &mdash;  ideas that work.</p>

		<p>My advice is for National YAF to contact The Florida State Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the State Rep. for the district in which FAU resides. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, FAU is part of the State university system. <br>

		<p>Notice the deplorable behavior of the University P.D.  It was Mizzou&rsquo;s P.D. that arrested the two &#8220;cotton ballers&#8221; on suspicion of committing a hate crime; as of this moment, the CA&rsquo;s office has not yet decided on what charges it will bring.  College and university PDs are pretty useless when it comes to stopping real crime, but they are good brown shirts for the diversity commissars that run the schools.</p>

		<p>Imagine if they were to start a white club, or a club devoted to the interests of whites, or even for whites to get together and just socialize with other whites? Why, then they&rsquo;d actually have real diversity, and not just a bunch of groups on campus for every group but whites, at the same time they all promise to do yet even more to foster &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Either sue or cause a riot.</p>
<p>These are the only two ways you will be treated with anything other than disdain by racist, marxist college admins.</p>
<p>A third(and personal favorite of mine) way would be to distribute pictures of the admin. that kicked them out as a freedom of speech hater and anti-white racist.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the claims are true(judging by the article, they are), as you&rsquo;re just dishing out the same thing leftists do.  The difference is that often they can&rsquo;t handle their own medicine.</p>

		<p>I notice Florida recently and dramatically raised its taxes because of severe budget shortfalls.  Likely, that will decrease, not increase the net taxes they take in.</p>
<p>FAU sounds like the perfect place to start cutting the state budget.</p>

<p>Are you thinking of FIRE?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;FIRE effectively and decisively defends American liberties on behalf of thousands of students and faculty on our nation&rsquo;s campuses. In case after case, FIRE brings about favorable resolutions for these individuals who continue to be challenged by those willing to deny fundamental rights and liberties within our institutions of higher education. In addition to individual case work, FIRE works nationally to inform the public about the fate of liberty on our campuses&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I know of no other organization that comes to the defense of conservative/libertarian college students who are denied Free Speech.  They fight university &#8216;speech codes&rsquo;  and designated &#8216;speech zones&rsquo; on campuses across the nation  &mdash;  and they win.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve come far:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;FIRE President Greg Lukianoff will be speaking this evening at the University of California, Berkeley. Greg&rsquo;s speech, which is co-sponsored by the The Patriot Group and Students for Liberty, will begin at 7 PM in Room 100 of the Genetics and Plant Biology Building. The event is free and open to the public&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>FIRE&rsquo;s website and a picture of Greg (notice how young he is) can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yjjejy8" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yjjejy8</a></p>
<p>Imagine such a group speaking on the UC Berkeley campus! </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;On Wednesday March 3, 2010, at 5:20 PM Florida Atlantic University (FAU) campus officials shut down and called campus police on four FAU students and an alumnus to stop an informational meeting about starting a conservative organization on campus&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite a dearth of publicity of this incident (you can be sure if it were gays, or non-Whites it would be national, headline news for weeks), they will lose.</p>
<p>More on FSU from FIRE:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Earlier this month, Florida State University&rsquo;s student government froze funding to two Christian student groups &mdash; the Christian Legal Society (CLS) and Every Nation Campus Ministry (ENCM) &mdash; on the grounds that the groups&rsquo; anti-discrimination policies did not extend to gays and lesbians. Florida State is a public university, and the First Amendment right to free association protects an organization&rsquo;s right to exclude those who disagree with the purpose and mission of the organization.</p>
<p>FIRE has now learned that at a meeting held last night, Florida State&rsquo;s student government did the right thing and rescinded its previous order to freeze funding to CLS and ENCM. Although funding never should have been frozen in the first place, we are pleased that the student government ultimately upheld the groups&rsquo; right to free association&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fire gives FSU its &#8216;red light&rsquo; rating: &#8221; A red light university has at least one policy that both clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>From FSU&rsquo;s own student code:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The right of all students to seek knowledge, debate ideas, form opinions, and freely express their ideas is fully recognized by Florida State University. This Student Conduct Code applies to student conduct and will not be used to discipline the lawful expression of ideas&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Since behavior which is not in keeping with standards acceptable to the university community is often symptomatic of attitudes, misconceptions, and emotional crises, the treatment of these attitudes, misconceptions, and emotional crises through REEDUCATION and REHABILITATIVE activities is an essential element of the disciplinary process&hellip;&#8221; [my emphasis]</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9gcdnp" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y9gcdnp</a></p>
<p>I guess calling the police and and using Nazi tactics AT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY funded by American taxpayers to  break up a meeting of those dastardly conservatives, restricting Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Assembly, is considered upholding FSU&rsquo;s code of conduct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see, in public, the justification for this. </p>
<p>Straight from the Soviet Union!  The Soviet Bosses would be proud.</p>

<p>I made a &#8220;DUH&#8221; kind of error.<br>
I put &#8220;FAIR&#8221; instead of &#8220;FIRE&#8221;<br>
If this post gets posted, all of the other info in my previous post was correct except the abbreviation.<br>
I think this is the organization you were thinking of.<br>
The correct nae is &#8220;FIRE&#8221;- Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Here&rsquo;s the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefire.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.thefire.org/</a></p>
<p>Sorry for the mistake.</p>
<p>I hope these conservative students will raise some cain about this and file suit against whomever appropriate.<br>
It&rsquo;s OK for the campus lefty libtards to shut down anybody that doesn&rsquo;t agree with them, for example, off the top of my head, Tom Tancredo as well as our esteemed Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>It is an absolute abomination that our Institutes of Higher Learning are nothing more than Soviet Era left wing indoctrination/reeducation camps.<br>
Not just the colleges and universities either. This kind of rubbish is going on in elementary, middle, junior high ad high schools. </p>

Hi www.amren.com!</p>
<p>Human-flesh search engines have become a Chinese phenomenon: they are a form of vigilante justice in which Internet users hunt down people who have attracted their wrath. The goal is to get them fired from their jobs, shamed in front of their neighbors, run out of town. It&rsquo;s crowd-sourced detective work, pursued online with offline results&hellip;<br>

		<p>What do I think about it?  (And thanks for asking.)</p>
<p>I think it is a very interesting concept. That NYT article was long, but worth reading.  Perhaps we could find out (for instance) just who Jeffrey Imm really is, where he really works, and all about him.  The real deal.  Hmmm.  Intriguing idea.  How perfect to turn the tables on him by his own methods.  After all, two can play the game as well as one.</p>
