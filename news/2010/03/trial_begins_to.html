			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Mays, Black Voices, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I&rsquo;m all for showing Black and Latina women who do not fit the traditional stereotype of being beautiful. I also support the rights of artists to be creative and interpretive. The mural at Times Square in New York City, though, misses the mark on both fronts.</p>
<p>Instead of showing the &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; beauty of Black, Latina and Caribbean women, I see two women on a couch who look like prostitutes. {snip} These images are anything but empowering. They represent the worst stereotypes about Black and Latina women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, [Sofia Maldonado, the artist] has failed with the two images that I saw.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Other women agree. New York City Black Professionals and Phenomenal Women Group Inc. have staged a small protest and called for the head of the Times Square Alliance to remove the mural.</p>
<p>Another image of a young girl riding a skateboard doesn&rsquo;t seem as bad but the young lady depicted is fully clothed. Black and Latina women already face the stereotype that they are loud, over-sexualized beings with nothing but attitude and sharp head movements for anyone who even looks at them for too long.</p>
<p>Images that would have broken the stereotype are ones that I see in my Harlem neighborhood every day.</p>
<p>I see women dressed professionally heading to work.</p>
<p>I see women in medical scrubs and white jackets heading to Harlem hospital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I see women entrepreneurs who own restaurants, salons and flower shops.</p>
<p>I see a Black woman lawyer with her own small practice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These are the images I see in my diverse neighborhood. I&rsquo;m not sure what Maldonado is looking at.</p>

		<p>When I drive downtown, this image is very very very representative of what I see.</p>
<p>PC has a moral obligation to reverse reality 180 degrees in everything it touches.</p>
<p>This attitude was feasable during the roaring 90&rsquo;s but during these times of joblessness reality is coming back to bite us in the rear and what we are told to see and what we actually see could never be farther apart.</p>

		<p>Consider a hypothetical: White male college students openly insert the picture in a college publication or on the internet. Imagine the massive outrage and venom from the Liberal establishment. Imagine what punishments would be inflicted on the White male perps. It would be much much more than &#8220;New York City Black Professionals and Phenomenal Women Group Inc. have staged a small protest&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cartoonish, I think. And why is the latina woman depicted as having blonde hair? That&rsquo;s anything but a typical Latino trait, I would say.</p>
<p>Does Sonia Sotomayor, the Wise Latina Woman of America, know about this?</p>

		<p>Hey, if a gringo had painted that mural, he&rsquo;d be hanging from the nearest tree already!  I think it IS in lousy taste; I live very close to a black area AND to Hispanic areas, and with the blacks, what I usually see is a black woman with one or two kids in tow, pushing a shopping cart.  The Hispanic girls all wear jeans that were sprayed on, with low-cut blouses/tanks and a lot of tattoos.  But if I visit the local hospital, I see plenty of both black and Hispanic medical personnel, from nurses&rsquo; aides all the way up to physicians.  I guess it&rsquo;s where you choose to hang out that determines what you see.</p>

		<p>I am an artist (songwriter), and it pains me somewhat to note that artists of the 20th century onward have a peculiar urge to be repugnant, twisted, offensive, lame, histrionic, narciccistic&hellip;the list goes on.<br>
What talent many visual artist have is often wasted on sensationalism, shock value and downright moronic theatre. They want to &#8220;make a statement,&#8221; but they really have little to say. Thus their art is banal, if lewd, crude, tasteless, gauche.<br>
In short, artists are morons, just like everybody else. <br>
The difference is, they have a paintbrush, and maybe just a hint of more personality disorders, Thus, the ugly stuffin those murals.<br>
Even if it&rsquo;s pretty representative, it is bent and revolting.</p>

		<p>The reason the Hispanic artist painted this kind of image is because this is the way many Hispanics really think (hence the reason for the stereotype in the first place).</p>
<p>The reason the writer sees some responsible blacks and Hispanics is because they live in a white society where they are expected to follow certain norms of behavior.</p>
<p>If the writer is so fond of &#8220;diversity&#8221; then he should be &#8220;celebrating&#8221; such &#8220;diversity of behavior&#8221; rather than expecting everyone to &#8220;act white&#8221; and even &#8220;paint white.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s VERY typical nowadays! At least in NYC. I see mulatto and mestizo faces crowned with every garish shade of dyed red or blond hair, all blinding my eyes! Very common. Very popular. Ah well, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t you ask Jenifer Lopez? She should know something about the subject. Everytime I see her, her hair is a different color (but never her own).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. But it&rsquo;s not so.   (Maybe she&rsquo;s had to work on her &#8220;Spanglish&#8221; as many Newyoricans would, since other Spanish-speakers don&rsquo;t consider it Spanish!!!)  </p>
<p>Nonetheless, she has issued albuns in Spanish and is big in Latin America.  She is also married to Marc Anthony (Marco Antonio Mu√±iz).<br>
I do know that the Puerto Ricans where I work are very proud of her as one of their own.</p>
<p>  <i> &#8220;Lopez released her first full Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer, in March 2007. Her husband, singer Marc Anthony, produced the album with Estefano, except for &#8220;Qu√© Hiciste&#8221;, which Anthony co-produced with Julio Reyes. The album peaked at  number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums for four straight weeks and on the U.S. Latin Pop Albums for seven straight weeks. &hellip;. Billboard magazine reported that Lopez and husband Marc Anthony would &#8220;co-headline&#8221; a worldwide tour called &#8220;Juntos en Concierto&#8221; starting in New Jersey on September 29.  The tour was a mix of her current music, older tunes and Spanish music. &#8221; </i> [Wiki]</p>
