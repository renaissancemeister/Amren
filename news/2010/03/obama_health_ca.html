			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, March 1, 2010 [scroll down]</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, President Obama attempted to kick-start the stalled health care debate by offering his own proposal to reform the U.S. health care system. While the White House states that the proposal &#8220;incorporates the work the House and the Senate have done and adds additional ideas from Republican members of Congress,&#8221; the president&rsquo;s plan is more akin to a list of ideas rather than actual legislative text. Importantly, the White House proposal is completely silent with respect to the immigration-related issues FAIR and other groups had raised concerning the House and Senate-passed health care bills.</p>
<p>Immigration reformers took issue with the House-passed health care bill (H.R. 3962) because it: (1) waives the five-year waiting period for legal aliens with respect to the taxpayer-subsidized affordability credits created under the legislation and (2) contains a flawed verification process that would allow illegal aliens to fraudulently obtain benefits. (See FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Analysis of H.R. 3962). There were similar problems in the Senate bill (H.R. 3590; See also FAIR&rsquo;s Legislative Analysis of H.R. 3590), although the Senate bill generally bars illegal aliens from participating in the &#8220;exchange&#8221; marketplace, while the House bill does not. (See FAIR President Dan Stein&rsquo;s USA Today op-ed, November 2009). It is unclear as to how President Obama&rsquo;s proposal would address these issues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, last week&rsquo;s bipartisan health care summit did not address any of these issues, and at this point, it remains uncertain as to how the health care debate will proceed.<br>

		<p>I prefer to look at the glass as half full:</p>
<p>Health care reform has become Obama&rsquo;s Stalingrad.  Win or lose, he emerges badly weakened.</p>
<p>PLUS, every week that the battle drags on is one less week for Congress to take up &#8220;Comprehensive Immigration Reform&#8221; before November.  If a health care reform bill had passed last June, we might very well be contemplating 12 million new Spanish-speaking citizens.</p>
<p>SO, the fight over illegal aliens in health care reform was a good fight, even if we eventually lose the battle.</p>

		<p>None of us who have worked hard and paid money into the system are going to be willing to let our hard-earned dollars pay for these illegals who have paid not one cent into Social Security or any other program in the system.  Obama&rsquo;s plan is quiet about illegals so that the illegals-lovers can contest it in court and, he hopes, win coverage for the illegals.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll happen; the public is for the most part dead set against it.  But we shall see&hellip;</p>

		<p>Quietly unnoticed by everyone and kept nowhere near any mainstream media outlet, is the fact that the vast majority of states have decided that, if this bill passes, they will &#8220;nullify&#8221; it.  In other words, that federal law will not apply in that state.  This is not one state or even a handful of states, but over 2/3 of the states.</p>
<p>I have to wonder about Obama.  He has really painted himself into a corner over this.  It&rsquo;s a total lose/lose situation for him.  Realistically, this bill will never see the light of day.  It can&rsquo;t pass the house.  The senate would pass it but there will be a large political price for it.  With it not being able to pass the house, there is no reason for any senator to risk it.  Obama is going to get the worst of all possible outcomes in a fight he can&rsquo;t possibly win.  He will try to ram it through with &#8220;reconcilliation&#8221;&hellip;.and fail.  This will reveal his lame duck status to the entire world and humiliate him and his entire administration.  In an election year, no less.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say he DOES win&hellip;.by some miracle, the democrats decide to throw themselves on their swords for him.  They are already facing a disater in this upcoming election.  But that pales in comparison to how the states will react.  They will literally lose all respect for the federal government.  The first thing they would do is nullify his healthcare bill.  Then they would extend this to a whole bunch of liberal garbage that has been forced down our throats for decades.  Most of the states would probably outlaw abortion&hellip;.kick out the department of education, start arresting, deporting, jailing illegals, cut off welfare to all problem people (example&hellip;.you need to pass a drug test every month for welfare), draconian sentencing for serious crimes completely ignoring federal guidelines.  Heck, a few of those states are considering nullifying ALL federal laws.  They could toss the entire federal judiciary apparatus out of their states.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough that this is already happening.  Wyoming, for example just passed a law that nullifies federal firearms regulation and its on its way to the governor to be signed.  Since it was passed unanimously, I highly doubt he will stand in its way.  If some federal judge has anything to say about it&hellip;.he could very well be told he doesn&rsquo;t have any authority at all in the matter.  There are 14 states considering this.  Another 24 plan to take up the matter this year (they just haven&rsquo;t done so yet).</p>
<p>This is a whole can of worms Obama is opening that he is likely to regret bitterly.  His entire administration has called into question the very legitimacy of the federal government itself.  Not with individuals.  Lots of people have known the federal government doesn&rsquo;t represent the people and hasn&rsquo;t for a long time, under either political party.  This is different.  This is states thinking this way.  And not a few either.  States have the authority and resources to do something about it.</p>

		<p>I, like most Americans, see nothing wrong with affordable healthcare for all.  The problem is that, as has often been pointed out, illegal aliens who do not belong here would have a disproportionate share of our tax supported system than they currently enjoy.  There are no countries in the world other than white countries that will give an illegal alien the kinds of benefits we already give.  In addition, our own permanent underclass would be further supported and increase in numbers not through hard work but through welfare support which in turn will require more welfare support until they outnumber the productive members of society.  What then?</p>
<p>One third of my paycheck goes to taxes.  I don&rsquo;t mind if that is to support my nation and my people, but what obligation do I have to support an illegal alien from central guatemala who sneaks over the border and has five kids and puts all of them on welfare, etc&hellip;?</p>
<p>If I sneak into China, or Egypt or Brazil, do I have the &#8216;right&rsquo; to demand access to all the social services that their citizens have?  I would be promptly arrested, perhaps roughed up, and either jailed or deported or both.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; movement is transnational marxism, and they are using race as their vehicle to build a new world order.  The missing part of their calculation is that after the non-whites take over, they will not maintain the structures that would be designed for promoting justice and fairness for all.  </p>
<p>The nations they will come to control will be rife with corruption, gang warfare, illiteracy and all the ills created by extreme immorality.  Those self same white liberals would also find themselves the victims of extreme violence and ethnic cleansing by gangs looking for blonde girl sex slaves.  The men would be simply killed or enslaved.  (Can you imagine a white liberal chick pleading about social justice while the non-whites take her into a room to&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire world, in short, will resemble Zimbabwe, southern Mexico or eastern Congo or other places where murder and looting are normal.  This is the blind side in the views of the white liberal racial marxists.  They don&rsquo;t realize that the society that created these and other sophisticated political and philosophical instruments can only survive when those self-same people are around and in control.</p>
<p>Marxism failed in Russia because it failed to take into account human nature (greed), and it failed in China for the same reason.  Racial marxists are not taking into account human failings and our biological propensity to tribalism.  Sadly, this time around, after the marxists screw up the core white nations, there will be no one left to speak of the enlightenment, civilization, literature, history and science.</p>
