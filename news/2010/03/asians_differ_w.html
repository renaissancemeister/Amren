<p>In fact, subgroups of Asians and Pacific Islanders can face dramatically different risks for developing certain diseases. One recent study found that Hmong adults in California have rates of liver and cervical cancer three to four times higher than those of other Asians and Pacific Islanders, for example.</p>
<p>And communities often vary wildly when it comes to preventive care and survival rates. The same study noted that Hmong residents were less likely than other Asians to get immunizations that can prevent both types of cancer.</p>
<p>To address some of these variances, the American Journal of Public Health on Thursday published its first issue devoted to health care in Asian and Pacific Islander populations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Breast cancer</b></p>
<p>Breast cancer has long been considered less of a problem for Asian women than for any other ethnic group. That&rsquo;s true for Asian women as a group, but when Bay Area researcher Scarlett Lin Gomez divided Asians into different nationalities, she found that Japanese women have rates of disease similar to white women.</p>
<p>Disease rates didn&rsquo;t just vary by nationality; whether a woman was born in the United States or in another country was also a factor. U.S.-born Chinese and Filipina women under age 55 actually had higher rates of breast cancer than white women of the same age, Gomez said. The study looked at more than 20,000 breast cancer cases among six Asian ethnic groups from 1998 to 2004.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research into heart disease also has suffered from lumping Asians together. Asian American adults as a group are 50 percent less likely to die from heart disease than white adults, according to one study published in Thursday&rsquo;s public health journal. But Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults, who are often included with Asians in health studies, are 40 percent more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease than white adults.</p>
<p><b>Targeting prevention</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Asian and Pacific Islander community is very diverse. They range from very recent immigrants, such as Vietnamese, to fifth- and sixth-generation Japanese American or Chinese American,&#8221; Nguyen [Bang Hai Nguyen, a research scientist with the Cancer Prevention Institute] said. &#8220;Each of these ethnic groups also has particular needs and languages and cultures. If you are just reaching out in one language, you&rsquo;re not really reaching everyone.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hmong adults in California have rates of liver and cervical cancer three to four times higher than those of other Asians and Pacific Islanders&#8221;</p>
<p>The high rates of liver and cervical cancer in the Hmong community are due to alcoholism and promiscuity. They are a stone age people, and like all stone age people, they succumb to a variety of addictions when transplanted into modern cultures.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s where they live and work at. Often in polluted cities. Then again, people of color love spice and additives in their food, because they are so spicy, and they think this makes them better than us. </p>

		<p>Fascinating.  I wonder if these statistics have been compared to those asians still living in their native homelands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see if it had anything to do with them switching over to a westernized diet.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Scarlett Lin Gomez divided Asians into different nationalities&#8221;</p>
<p>That is a telling statement.  It doesn&rsquo;t say ethnicities, it says nationalities, which are two different things.  I could be an ethnic Hungarian with Romanian nationality, born and raised in Romania.  This is just a small example of how our nation is fracturing.  We have failed to develop a feeling of &#8220;American&#8221; as our primary nationality.  And not just among recent non-white immigrants.  We have too many hyphenated Americans and that means trouble.  Brazilians, regardless of race or ethnic background, seem very proud of being Brazilian first and foremost.  The same with Mexicans.  But Americans, not so much.  We are Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans, etc..  Worse yet are the groups, such as Mexican-Americans, Jewish-Americans and Chinese-Americans, whose loyalties are often less than clear cut.  Roman Empire here we come!<br>

		<p>The differences among Asians susceptibility to certain cancers is due to economic status. The Hmong, for example are a recent immigrant group and do not get the same quality healthcare that a fourth generation Japanese or Chinese American professional would get such as pap smears, mammograms, colonoscopies, etc.</p>

		<p>Cervical cancer is a sexually-transmitted disease.  As well ask why one group suffers more from ghonorrhea or chlamydia!  Liver cancer is frequently related to hepatitis-C and diabetes, though.  Is the hep-C infection rate among Hmong higher?  Alcoholism doesn&rsquo;t seem a likely cause, as cirhosis tends to kill faster than cancer among boozehounds.  East Asians also make fairly poor alcoholics - most get flushed and feel uncomfortable and then stop drinking; and never develop the tolerance that typical alchoholics acquire.  The interesting point the article makes here is that ethnic Japanese women in the United States have breast cancer rates similar to that for white women.  What it doesn&rsquo;t say is that breast cancer is very, very rare in Japan.  Is the difference due to the (Western) diet - high in animal fats - they tend to eat here, since Japanese are perhaps the most assimilated of any Asian ethnic group?  The higher heart disease rates among Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders makes perfect intuitive sense, given that so many are very overweight.  An interesting article, which raises more questions than it answers.</p>

		<p>@4 (Istvan). Actually, &#8220;nationality&#8221; in the truest sense of the word means &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;. Her wording is more telling in that she admits it.</p>

		<p>With regard to post #06, this might not be as true in a<br>
developed society like ours.  Professor Linda Gottfredson has<br>
done remarkable research, clearly posted on her webpage, about<br>
the direct relationship between IQ and personal health provision, illness/accident prevention in the U.S.  It seems largely an effect of low IQ that many people at the base of the social pyramid do not behave with insight and time preferences basic to illness/accident prevention Low income level appears not to contribute a lot to the problem.    </p>
