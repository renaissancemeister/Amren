			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Claiborne and Hanna Siegel, ABC News, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the things that lie ahead for the Haitian children adopted by white American parents are a better life materially and a chance to grow up in a loving family.</p>
<p><b>Outside Looking In</b></p>
<p>But some black children who were adopted by white parents say there&rsquo;s another side of the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was seen or understood,&#8221; said Phil Bertelsen, who was 4 when he was adopted by a white family and then raised in a mostly white New Jersey suburb.</p>
<p>Bertelsen and other black adoptees tell a similar tale: They felt estranged from the people around them who they instinctively knew from an early age were different from them, and yet cut off from their own racial identity and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my teens, I became hungry to be a part of some kind of black community, black identity,&#8221; Bertelsen said. &#8220;What was missed primarily was, you know, strong familiar representations of black life other than the ones I was getting through popular culture and otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bertelsen said in an interview that adoptees &#8220;don&rsquo;t tend to want to shake the tree too much. I call it the gratitude complex. We finally get this family, whomever they are, that we can call our own and so we adjust, we adapt, we learn to go along and get along and that&rsquo;s what I did.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Hard Truth for Adoptive Parents</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Through his movie, Bertelsen said, he was able to say what he had always wanted to say: &#8220;See me. This is who I am.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>An Identity Struggle</b></p>
<p>For more than 20 years, starting in 1972, transracial adoptions in the United States all but ended after the National Black Social Workers Association condemned them as cultural genocide.</p>
<p>The group takes a softer line now but it still maintains that it&rsquo;s better for children when parents are from the same racial or ethnic background.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Spence-Chapin Adoption Agency in New York City, which facilitates many transracial adoptions, urged white parents who adopt black children to move to an integrated neighborhood, send their child to an integrated school and expose them to other black people.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I tell people,&#8221; Rita Taddonio, who directs the agency&rsquo;s Adoption Resource Center, said. &#8220;If you look around your table and your guests are all the same color, if you don&rsquo;t have diversity around your kitchen table then you shouldn&rsquo;t be adopting a child of a different color.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are ways to help your child cope, she said. &#8220;We recommend parents connect to the black community, that they make sure they have friends in those areas, that they go to a black church or be part of the community as well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Every parent&rsquo;s job is to help them form an identity, it&rsquo;s just an additional layer of complexity when your child&rsquo;s identity has pieces of it that you don&rsquo;t own.&#8221;</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;ve never understood   &mdash;   NEVER   &mdash;   why White parents would want to adopt a black child, when they see all the social pathologies that are common to black groups, whether they&rsquo;re black Americans, Haitians, or Africans. Listen, adoptive White parents: The child doesn&rsquo;t look like you; it WON&rsquo;T look like you, ever. There will be uncomfortable moments galore; there will be identity confusion and rebellion, most likely, when the child becomes a teenager. That&rsquo;s on top of all the problems of raising your own, biological teenager!</p>
<p> Isn&rsquo;t raising a child who looks like you difficult enough, without your deliberately assuming yet another layer of challenge? Were you so consumed with White Guilt that you just HAD to take in a black child to &#8220;make amends&#8221; for something or other, that you had no part in causing in the first place?</p>
<p> Listen to me if you&rsquo;ve ever thought of &#8220;Adopting Black&#8221;: You&rsquo;re borrowing trouble   &mdash;   a whole lot of it. It&rsquo;s not your fault so many blacks have screwed up their lives. You have no &#8220;amends&#8221; to make. Let black couples adopt their own. You can find a White child if you just look hard enough.</p>

		<p>Sadly, Whites who adopt non-White children are some of the most brain-washed and politically correct Whites around.  Some of them value other races more than they value their own.  This is due to their natural susceptibility to media conditioning.  They are self-haters, hating their own race and blaming their own race for the world&rsquo;s problems.  Some of them are misguided do-gooders who, though not actually self-haters, believe every race in the world is somehow owed something by Whites, again this is partly due to the media conditioning that they&rsquo;ve received.</p>

<p>I was under the assumption that alot of White couples who adopt black children are trying to break the pattern of under achievement and provide a solid stable environment to nourish the kid that would generally not have existed otherwise.  Putting the child in a black environment and exposing him to black &#8220;culture&#8221; goes against the grain of what these people are trying to accomplish.  They need to choose between molding the child to White norms, possibly damaging him psychologically, or putting the interests of the child first.  They should seriously re-think transracial adoptions if it means exposing themselves to the constant danger that comes from close contact with minorities.  Pinning themselves down in ugly transitional neighborhoods in homes that don&rsquo;t build equity and are difficult to sale and sending their kids, including any biological ones, to failed schools that are little more than publicly funded daycare centers.   </p>

I am a 36 year old Black women who was adopted by White parents and lived in a racially mixed, but predomiately White environment.</p>
<p>My life has been exceptional. I have visited places and had experiences that many people Black or White have can only dream of. My adoptive parents provided me with enviable opportunities. </p>
<p>I have never felt any &#8220;confusion&#8221; as to who I am. I am a Black person. However, I was raised by loving,caring and culturally inclusive White parents. I have no doubt that I am as successful today due to their attentive concern for me. </p>
<p>Children should be raised in an environment that is conducive to learning and where love and support are in abundance. Race should be irrelevant. </p>

<p>Yes you do Wayne.</p>
<p>Besides feeling guilty for black social pathologies, too many whites want to believe that a little tender-loving care from a non-racist white person can transform a black child into a outstanding member of society. As Mr. Taylor has said, &#8216;the problem with whites is that they&rsquo;re too nice&rsquo; (I would add trusting, caring, and foolishly gullible).</p>

<p>This complaint has been around for years. Even our President felt he was caught between two worlds. And it was the white side of his family that came through for him. The only thing his father contributed to his life was the sperm.<br>

		<p>The black community as a whole has such a complex about itself, that they&rsquo;d rather see their children grow up in squalor and maintain their &#8220;blackness,&#8221; than have to hold their nose and give white people credit for doing a better job of raising black kids than black people seem to be able to do themselves.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of the &#8220;grandparents&#8221; of these adopted kids are secretly embarrassed that their children adopted black kids.  I&rsquo;m sure very few would admit it, for obvious reasons.  I can&rsquo;t imagine rolling a black kid around in a stroller and introducing him as my &#8220;grandson&#8221;.  The temptation to call him &#8220;my ADOPTED grandson&#8221; would be overwhelming.  </p>

		<p>Were I still of an age where I could adopt a child, I&rsquo;d have no problem whatever in adopting a Korean, Chinese, or Vietnamese infant.  They readily asimilate and are blessed with white European or often higher levels of intelligence, plus they often are in desperate circumstances in their native environments.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances would I consider adopting a black African child.  He/she would have a high statistical probability of low IQ, problematic impulse control, and vicious peer pressure from other blacks, who often exist without knowing who or where their fathers are.  </p>
<p>Any white who would adopt a black child suffers from serious psychological problems and will soon have more than just psychological problems on his hands.</p>

<p>What survival skills will the Agency teach to the integrationist White parents who move into black neighborhoods?  Whites who move into black neighborhoods are suicidal, but then again, so are Whites who adopt non white children.</p>

The media constantly tells us White American Citizens  how we are supposed to think of ourselves in relation to the afrovoodoos. We are supposed to feel an obligation to rid ourselves of racism by putting the wants, wishes, and needs of blacks ahead of our White children, our White selves, and our White communities. </p>
<p>The &#8220;need to do more&#8221; always is put upon us Whites.  Blacks&rsquo; problems are all caused by our &#8220;not doing enough, not soon enough&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t the blacks &#8220;need to do more&#8221; to bring civilization to their Detroit, Gary, East St. Louis, Newark, Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, etc.?  Why don&rsquo;t the blacks &#8220;need to do more&#8221; in not robbing, raping, and murdering our beautiful White daughters, such as Channon Christian, Eve Carson, Anne Pressley, Kristen Warneke, Emily Haddock, etc etc etc?</p>
<p>Cartesse Dalton predicted first on Amren that there will come a push to demand that Obama read the Gettysburg Address during his second term in 2013.  Tonight, Hannity reported that the Obama Gettysburg push has started. </p>

<p>Whoever is president on November 19, 2013 will give the 150th anniversary reading of Father Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address. The political campaign of 2012 will demand that &ldquo;we must have our historic first African American President Obama reelected so he can read the Gettysburg Address in 2013 and show how far we&rsquo;ve come, while also reminding us of how much more work we need to do in eradicating White Privilege by paying slavery reparations to African Americans, all of whom would have been brilliant philosophers and scientists if they had not been kidnapped and stolen from Africa by the blonde haired, blue eyed evil Europeans.&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
Yesterday, the USNews and World Report announced that the campaign has begun.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yfwt27l</p>
<p>text</p>
<p>One town is already banking on President Obama&rsquo;s re-election: Gettysburg, Pa. Looking ahead to July 2013, organizers of the 150th anniversary of the decisive three-day clash between Union and Confederate forces have extended an invitation for Obama to deliver his own Gettysburg address, we hear. &#8220;That would be really cool,&#8221; says Gettysburg Convention and Visitors Bureau President Norris Flowers. &#8220;I expect that.&#8221; </p>
<p>end</p>
<p>Maybe they say he&rsquo;s to give the &#8220;new&#8221; Gettysburg Address, but the real one was short enough to be included in the new Obama version, so the Cartesseian prediction stands.</p>
<p>Between now and then, he will have taken over health care with the Hispanic Caucus votes in exchange for giving the illegal non white aliens all citizenship and the vote.  He&rsquo;ll be obliged to give his new Gettysburg Address in Mestizo Hispano Spanish.<br>

		<p>Sad it is no.5, Angela, that your race have no choice,only to run to the whites for love and abundant support. Sounds to me that you have the same altruist ingrain as some weak whites. It&rsquo;s irrelevant to you because you had a birds eye view of your people.&#8221; Now you can go back to your people and consel them on how to behave!&#8221;  PS, what&rsquo;s it like to live with traitors of the white people? &#8220;seriously!&#8221;</p>

		<p>My nephew and his wife adopted two african twin girls from Ivory Coast 8 years ago. They are now in the 9th grade. </p>
<p>My nephew is a buisness consultant. His wife is a college provost and is currently a finalist for a college presidency at a small liberal arts college in the midwest.</p>
<p>The kids are well behaved and excel in the prep school they attend, but I was very dissappointed in my nephew and his wife for doing such a thing. I have hinted to him that these girls may very well be problems down the road, but he argues that the same potential problems could be true if he had adopted White children. </p>

		<p>There is confusion here. On one hand,  we are told that there are no racial differences, Blacks and Whites are exactly the same, except for skin color. On the other hand, we are told there are differences in many areas such as adopting children, Whites can&rsquo;t provide Black kids with what they need because they are White. </p>

		<p>More of the vast hypocrisy of the Left, which on the one hand insists that all people and cultures are absolutely the same and that any observation of differences is racism; yet on the other hand says that Whites are incapable of raising Black children without exposing them to their own unique Black culture.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have it both ways, Lefties.  The people are going to eventually put 2 and 2 together, and your insistence upon forcing integration through interracial adoption and intermarriage is going to backfire upon you in a major way.  </p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid that they are as rare as dinosaur eggs. There are fewer white children up for adoption anyway. I believe that blacks generally adopt fewer children than whites and stick to members of their own race  &mdash;  although many favor lighter skinned black children. The adoption preference for &#8221; yellow&#8221; skinned children (unconscious racism) is not uncommon. </p>

		<p>Whites who adopt blacks often feel morally superior for doing so. Don&rsquo;t they realize that they are stealing that child&rsquo;s racial and cultural heritage? They&rsquo;re really the White Supremacists because they feel that it is fine to impose their (white) ways of life on black children.</p>
<p>I believe that each group of people has its own cultural and racial heritage, and that all people have the natural right to preserve, celebrate, and be a part of their own heritage. Let&rsquo;s preserve our own cultures and inheritances, and let other groups do the same. (Now, if only the minorities would take the same attitude toward us&hellip;)</p>

		<p>Back in 1995 there was a movie called &#8220;Losing Isaiah.&#8221;  Rent it.  It speaks volumes on why transracial adoptions create more problems than they&rsquo;re worth.  Samuel L. Jackson&rsquo;s courtroom speech, though obviously pro-black, is priceless for its insights.</p>
