<h1>Report: E-Verify Misses a Lot of Illegal Workers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Wall, San Bernardino Sun, February 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Touted by some as an essential tool for stopping illegal immigration, an independent research firm says the E-Verify system flags less than half the number of illegal workers it checks.</p>
<p>E-Verify, a free online program used voluntarily by employers, fails to catch 54 percent of the illegal workers run through the system because it can&rsquo;t detect identity fraud, the report states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say the report shows the need to find more effective ways to stop employers who willingly violate immigration laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration officials note the report&rsquo;s finding that E-Verify&rsquo;s overall accuracy rate for legal and illegal workers is 96 percent.</p>
<p>Only 6 percent of the names run through E-Verify databases involve illegal workers. Fifty-four percent of those illegal workers are not cleared to work, the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal officials say recent improvements to E-Verify include changes to reduce typographical errors; a photo-screening tool to combat document fraud; and establishment of a monitoring and compliance unit to detect and deter identity fraud, discrimination and misuse.</p>
<p>While conceding that E-Verify is &#8220;not perfect,&#8221; the system is &#8220;much more effective than the Form I-9 (paper) verification process used by employers&#8221; not participating in the program, according to the report.</p>

		<p>Read carefully   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s not E-Verify that&rsquo;s failing, it&rsquo;s that the illegals appropriate a citizen&rsquo;s identity.  That&rsquo;s not E-Verify&rsquo;s fault.  However, intellectually dishonest xenophiles who want cheap labor and open borders will use anything they can to get rid of E-Verify.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering, the reason E-Verify is so important is that, without it, employers are stuck in the middle of a Catch-22.  They&rsquo;re caught between the rock of violating Federal law by hiring illegal aliens, and the hard place of &#8220;discriminating&#8221; against a Hispanic by not hiring him or her.  E-Verify is by far the best way out.  For anyone to say they&rsquo;re against E-Verify is to say they want illegal aliens in country and taking legit jobs.  </p>
<p>Strangely enough, in yesterday&rsquo;s vote in Texas, only Kay Bailey Hutchinson was for E-Verify, the other two bigmouths are against it.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is spot on all his points as regards E-Verify.  I would add:</p>
<p>*184,000 U. S. companies/government agencies use E-Verify as of February 13, 2010.</p>
<p>*I called the human resource directors of two local governments in my area using E-Verify.  Both are very pleased with it.</p>
<p>*Robert Rector, the Heritage Foundation researcher credited with exposing the immense costs of the Bush-McCain-Kennedy Amnesty bill in 2007, made the following remarkes about E-Verify at the CPAC panel on immigration in February:</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty years ago [1986], we granted an amnesty &hellip; In exchange for that one-time amnesty, we were told that we would enforce the law and that it would be unlawful to hire illegal immigrants, and if you did so, you would be punished.  And for twenty years that law has been laughed at &hellip; by the Clinton administration &hellip; the Bush administration &hellip; the Obama administration.  But let me tell you that you could enforce that law tomorrow, and the way you could do it is by something called E-Verify.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With E-Verify when someone comes to apply for a job, you type in the name, social security and date of birth and within about a quarter of a second, the data comes back and says that hey that matches existing records in social security.  This is a lawful person.  E-Verify  &mdash;  if you required it to be used across all businesses in the United States  &mdash;  would automatically eliminate probably five to six million jobs for illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let me see, how many Americans are currently unemployed?  About 10 million.  So suppose we said why don&rsquo;t we enforce the law from twenty years ago requiring businesses to actually verify whether the people working for them and are being hired are here illegally.  If you did that you would very rapidly free up, I believe, four to five million jobs freed up for currently unemployed Americans &hellip; American jobs belong to American citizens and it&rsquo;s time to adopt that policy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Recommended: Take 8 minutes and listen to Robert Rector.  Here&rsquo;s how: </p>
<p>Rector is quoted below addressing an immigration panel at CPAC. Scroll to the 20:10 minute mark at the video linked below to hear the open-borders Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s John Fund&rsquo;s one-minute introduction of Rector; then listen to Rector for the next eight minutes  &mdash;  to the 29:00 minute mark.  Final minute: An anxious Fund raises a red herring issue (vulnerabilty of border agents to corruption) to distract from the power of Rectors&rsquo; remarks:<br>

		<p>E-Verify, if implemented as a regulation or component to hiring, would produce great results. This of course could potentially chase off and deter millions. While this would be wonderful and relieve the burden quite dramatically &hellip;.. we would still be faced with the true bottom feeders. </p>
<p>The gang-banging, drug dealing, prostitution ring running slime whom operate off board would still be an issue. While I do believe the gardeners &amp; the drive thru attendants should pack-up and move along - it is this second group that really deserves the greatest attention. </p>
<p>It was  nice to see the &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; press run the story on the cultivation going on in the national parks earlier this week. Still, we just do not see the across the board reporting that is necessary to really swing the public against this illegal invasion. </p>
<p>The press is quick to point out the violence IN Mexico, however&hellip;. outside this website and a handful like it &hellip;&hellip;does anyone think the average American has any idea of the amount of deaths, kidnappings, child molestations and other heinous crimes that these &#8216;well cultured&rsquo; individuals are involved in?</p>
<p>Viva La Verify!</p>

		<p>I work directly with immigrants and their documents and can tell you forcefully that illegal aliens often pay for &#8220;the package.&#8221;  This is a birth certificate, social security card, and other documents that purport to make the illegal into another person&hellip;..i.e. &#8220;identity theft.&#8221;  Puerto Rican documents are frequently implicated in these sorts of cases.</p>
<p>The rub comes in when local, county, and state police officers will STILL REFUSE TO ISSUE THE CITATION FOR &#8220;IDENTITY THEFT&#8221; OR &#8221; FALSE DOCUMENTS&#8221; OR &#8220;FALSE APPLICATION&#8221; since they tell themselves &#8220;Oh, this person will never show up for court,&#8221; or, &#8220;we really don&rsquo;t know who this is, so who knows?&#8221; or, my favorite, &#8220;let&rsquo;s just tell him not to come back here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I always tell the police in these cases that it&rsquo;s their job to issue the citation, and it&rsquo;s the prosecutor and judge&rsquo;s job to decide how to make the case proceed&hellip;.not theirs!!</p>

		<p>If you want to know the truth about E-verify, go to the NumbersUSA site.</p>
<p>Be deeply suspicious whenever a liberal tells you something can&rsquo;t be done or &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t work&#8221;.  It usually means the exact opposite.  I suspect E-verify catches 99% and results in scofflaw employers ending up in prison pretty quick.  It just doesn&rsquo;t catch a determined criminal willing to spend lots of money, time and resources to get around it.</p>
<p>In other words, if I steal someone&rsquo;s identity, spend lots of time and money preserving it (so it won&rsquo;t get flagged as stolen), am careful to make sure its something that won&rsquo;t easily be checked (like a person&rsquo;s ID in a nursing home or something)&hellip;.then yes, half the time, I will successfully get around E-verify.  But realistically, the average 50 cent an hour slave from mexico gets caught with no chance of evasion.</p>
<p>A comment about my use of the term &#8220;slave&#8221;.  I think anti-immigration activists should start referring to &#8220;economic migrants&#8221; using this term.  It is descriptive, honest, and doesn&rsquo;t allow pro-immigrant types the luxury of dodging the most important issue with regard to immigration.  These people are coming to the US to be a slave caste.  To work for slave wages and many times to work under conditions of overt slavery.  Literal slaves instead of just figurative slaves.  People chained together to work, fields of marijuana kept by drug dealers on public land, for example.  These people taste the whip in their day to day lives&hellip;.and are the very real shame of our country and our people.  That, after all this time, we allow this to go on.  Women and children trafficked in brothels.  Men kept in bondage&hellip;.SLAVERY.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we called this what it is.</p>
<p>Remember that the next time someone calls you a racist for espousing white nationalism or simply taking a conservative position that illegal imigration should not be allowed.  Those doing it promote slavery.  Most unknowingly.  But many KNOW what is going on.  Think about what those videos exposing what goes on with ACORN reveal.  These were people willing to aid and abet human trafficking of women and children as literal sex slaves.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>

		<p>The only way to drive out and keep out the Hispanic, Muslim, Black African, Red Chinese and East Indian alien job and welfare thieves is to make them fear for their lives.  </p>
<p>This is, after all, our country and we owe the afore mentioned culturally incompatible aliens nothing.  </p>
<p>Our forefathers built this nation first and foremost for whites and our progeny.  </p>

<p><br>
Would it really?  I&rsquo;m not so sure.  There are three forces that bring immigrants to this country (and coming to assimilate with a real job as a productive citizen is not one of them).  Ok&hellip;maybe .0002% of them come for that reason.  But the vast majority are here for reasons of social pathology&hellip;not legitimate immigration.</p>
<p>These are slavery (addressed above), welfare theft and drug dealing.  The three are intimately inter-related.  Example.  An &#8220;economic migrant&#8221; comes to the US to pick oranges.  He makes 50 cents an hour off the books.  He goes down to the local welfare office because there is no way you can live on 50 cents an hour, obviously.  It&rsquo;s illegal by federal law for him to collect welfare but everyone who works at the welfare office is a neo-communist liberal.  They know he is illegal.  Heck, he TELLS them he is an illegal.  They ignore all this and give him whatever they can&hellip;.food stamps, pay his phone, electric, rent whatever.  He now has 50 cents an hour wage and doesn&rsquo;t have to use one penny of it to take care of himself.  He goes to his cousin, the drug dealer and gives him his entire months wages for as much crack, heroin or meth that it will buy.  So do several thousand similar slaves on illegal welfare.</p>
<p>See how that works?  You can interrupt any link of the chain to make it fall apart.  Without the ability to get an illegal job, he has no money for drugs, unless he can find a way to convert his welfare into cash.  Some succeed, others fail and drop out of the profit margin for the drug dealers, prostitutes, etc.</p>
<p>The best way to handle this problem is by addressing all three facets.  Squeeze them out of illegal jobs.  Make sure they can&rsquo;t get welfare&hellip;.and reject people bringing drugs over the border.  As these three things cause far more problems together than they do individually, going after all three is much more effective combined than it would be separately.</p>
<p>E-verify is a good start.  But only a start.  But I think the important part is that it shows how kicking out the 40 million or so from south of the border is totally doable.  It might not even be all that difficult.</p>

		<p>I have no doubt that due to identity fraud many illegals are able to slip through the E-verify screen.  But E-verify is a lot better than nothing, and the right response is to crack down on identity fraud and make it more difficult.  No doubt critics of E-verify will use its imperfections to ditch it entirely.</p>

		<p>E-Verify works so well that a Mexican consular official travelled to address the Arizona state legislature, complaining that the system was causing so many illegal aliens to &#8220;self-deport&#8221; that Mexican schools were becoming overcrowded and their hospitals were suffering from the expense of unpaid treatment.</p>
<p>Identity thefts is already a felony.  Rigorous enforcement of this law would go a long way toward closing this loophole.  Note that the Puerto Rican government has recently invalidated ALL P.R. birth certificates in an attempt to deal with the problem.</p>

		<p>#10 Anonymous - really good points there &amp; this is pretty much why I have become a big fan of AMREN. It is great to be permitted ( at least for the moment ) to exchange perspectives with those that are like minded.</p>
<p>In other words - if we move the herd away from our pastures, then the wolves will follow. Additionally, they would be far more noticeable and more efficiently dealt with. Providing, of course, this country wakes up and realizes this problem.</p>

<p>This just cracked me up.  The consular official had enough chutzpah to complain that Mexico was having to pay for the costs of poor Mexicans, rather than the United States!  Had I been in the Arizona legislature at the time I&rsquo;d have laughed out loud.</p>

		<p>  This is  &mdash;  WHY  &mdash;  E-Verify must be fully funded, permanent and using the money to make the program a keystone of immigration enforcement. It&rsquo;s being updated constantly with new innovations including using green card holders and complimentary data bases. No! its not been perfected yet, but give it time?  There are many  business elements that doesn&rsquo;t want the program to succeed, nor thousands of other organizations that have a ominous reasons which is power-money and large profits. E-Verify is not going the way of the Do-Do.bird, as it will get stronger and it&rsquo;s databases cross-reference with perhaps even with IRS and Census records. Even now politicians are trying to substitute E-Verify, for some other tool. I don&rsquo;t trust them as they will do anything to undermine any working tool.  With the technology we have inherited today, we can mandate its use and hire the top computer engineers to perfect its ability, to deport every illegal immigrant in America.</p>
<p>Not the 12 million facade that we have brain washed with, but the  &mdash;  REAL  &mdash;  number of somewhere between 20 and 30 unauthorized foreigners bleeding our nation dry. E-Verify in its second generation performance, could be used to drivers license irregularities, vehicle registrations, insurance fraud, along with house mortgages, health care and much more. Every local police department should be funded to train its police in the 287 (G) program, with instruction to arrest and hand over to ICE.  Then ICE should not be blocked by a wimpy Janet Napolitano, who has ordered the agents to slowly desist on immigration raids. Perhaps the inception of the &#8220;TEA PARTY&#8221; movement has an agenda to stop this absolute travesty of our immigration enforcement? Immigration is one big game, playing with peoples lives. It starts with national security? Politicians pushing New Employee Verification Act, or NEVA, is just another hold-up,  to staunch the use of  E-Verify. Just more corrupt lawmakers who owe favors to business groups, who want  to see the end  to E-Verify.</p>
<p>Even if a Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill passed, do we really think that the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants walking the streets is coming out of the so called shadows? Neither are they going to answer the door to the adjudicator, who is out counting the population for the 2010 US Census. They will run and hid, because the came here illegally thumbing their noses at The People&rsquo;s Law and don&rsquo;t trust the US government. Let&rsquo;s face it, a great majority of the American people cannot trust the government, because they continuously lie to us. Two politicians that must  &mdash;  GO  &mdash;  in the midterm elections is Sen. Harry Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Has anybody ever considered the fact that no immigration enforcement tool ever really  &mdash;  WORKS. The fence-No Match letter-ICE raids.</p>
<p>ALL WERE COMPROMISED. The First line of defense the International fence was meant to be a double barrier, not a single fence. Places in Indian reservations and barren areas have no restrictions, no tower, no sensors, no cameras. No match letter was rescinded. ICE raids have been cut well back by Napolitano. Border states need a lot of help? They are uninterrupted by the illegal immigration invasion. That&rsquo;s why states like California that refuses to immunize itself against the invasion and need budgetary stewards like Steve Poizner, as a new governor who promises to fight back against supporting illegal alien families public entitlements  Sen. Shelby shows his support for rescinding the instant Birthright Citizenship for any pregnant female, who makes it past federal agents at airports or at the borders.<br>
