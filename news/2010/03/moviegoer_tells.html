<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The stabbing occurred last Saturday at the Cinemark 22</p>
<p>A woman talking on a cell phone during a movie didn&rsquo;t take to kindly to being &#8216;shushed&rsquo; by another moviegoer. Or at least her boyfriend didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In a drama that turned more lively than the one on screen, the boyfriend allegedly attacked and stabbed the &#8216;shusher&rsquo; in the neck. With a meat thermometer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Sheriff&rsquo;s officials, the suspects were described as black males. One man was wearing an orange hat with an orange jersey and the other man was dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt.</p>
<p>There was no word on why the man had a meat thermometer in a movie theater.<br>

								<h2>Moviegoer Stabbed With Meat Thermometer After Complaining About Cell Phone</h2>
						<p>
							<i>KTLA-TV News (Los Angeles), March 10, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A man is recovering from being stabbed in the neck with a meat thermometer after asking a woman to silence her cell phone in a movie theater, a sheriff&rsquo;s department official said.</p>
<p>The stabbing occurred Saturday at the Cinemark 22 theater at 2600 West Avenue I in Lancaster, according to Detective Richard Cartmill of the Lancaster sheriff&rsquo;s station.</p>
<p>The theater was packed for a 9 p.m. Saturday screening of the Martin Scorsese horror movie &#8216;Shutter Island&rsquo; when the victim complained about a woman near him who was using a cellphone during the show.</p>
<p>She and two men with her left the movie theater.</p>
<p>Two men returned a few minutes later and stabbed the victim, said sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Steve Whitmore.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two other people who attempted to help the victim were also injured in the altercation.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s officials describe the suspects as black males.</p>

		<p>I have arrested this type numerous times. Frequently I find cheap dollar store steak knives in their purses.(I have never found a prostitute who didnt have one!) Box cutters litter the shrubbery outside my courthouse, where they are stashed till their owners come out of court.  Any common tool with a blade or point is employed. They dont plan to have them long, or to have anything that classifies as a weapon if stopped by  the law.</p>
<p>This is another reason I dont like going to movies anymore.  </p>

<i>Sheriff&rsquo;s officials describe the suspects as black males.</i></p>
<p>Believe it or not, this meager description, two black males, is more than you&rsquo;ll find in the Buffalo News.</p>
<p>How does one confront these situations; pointing out to a black person that they&rsquo;re acting like a black stereotype?</p>
<p>The victim should have celebrated the diversity she brought to the theater. Without her and her friends, the victim would only have left with the experience of watching a movie instead of the real life excitement of riding in an ambulance and seeing the inside of a hospital.<br>

		<p>The more time that elapses, the more I believe it isn&rsquo;t safe or smart for white people to go to any kind of public event unless they go with a group of at least 20 armed people.  I carry a knife myself, and I&rsquo;m an almost-65 year old granny.  Many other women I know, in their 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, carry knives (and yes we&rsquo;re white women!)- simply because without a knife, we are helpless against any young black or whatever male who tries to attack us.  It IS a serious issue; it is so serious, in fact, that I&rsquo;m going to be leaving a very secure home in the city for a stronghold in the foothills of a well-known mountain range.  I can have my guns there, my knives, my stash of food, water and precious metals, and a big hairy dog with teeth!</p>

		<p>What White person in their right mind would go to any movie theater in America today? From what I have heard it is full of nonwhites and the noise is unbearable due to the type that go there. Like most blacks care about rules and decorum&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t been to a movie in the last 25 years and don&rsquo;t intend to start now. Wait for it to come out on DVD, people.</p>

		<p>Lancaster, for you non-Californians, is a town north of Los Angeles, in what we call the high desert.  Blacks in the desert?  <br>
     With the loss of aerospace jobs in California, a lot of people lost their houses near Edward&rsquo;s Air Force Base.  To fill them, the developers brought in Section 8 characters straight outta Compton.  As the Mexicans pushed, the developers pulled, so now these once White towns are full of Blacks who have never had a job in their lives, living in four bedroom, three bath, 2500 sq ft houses.  The LA times ran a three or four part series on this maybe 15 years ago.  I wonder if the White kids who moved away ever drop by to marvel at the changes.</p>

<p>Yes I agree. That also surprised me too. They usually never say the race, at least not when the criminals are black. What I would like to know is what was the race of the victim?</p>
<p>Simon Krejsa has a very interesting article on Vdare.com about how blacks and hispanics are decsribed as &#8220;Whites&#8221; when they commit crimes. There are many photos of the &#8220;White&#8221; criminals. It is well worth a look. If any of these thugs are &#8220;White&#8221; then I am the emperor of the north pole!</p>

<p>It is obvious to me that the writer of this article has never attempted to bring a spear into motion picture theater. The anti-shoosher team sacrificed long range and superb penetration capability. </p>
<p>See, they be learnin to coexist. We should be grateful that they demonstrated consideration and left their drums in the village. </p>
<p>Since there were 2 males, maybe they needed some area of shaded privacy to determine how their tube steaks are cooking.  </p>

		<p>I have largely stopped going to movie theaters because of the loud, obnoxious and ignorant behaviour of blacks at them. If I go to a movie theatre at all it is only after the film has been out for several weeks and there is virtually no one in the theatre. The last time I was at a theatre that was crowded was about six years ago. There was this one big loudmouth mulatto-looking type black there who you could hear thirty seats away throughout the movie. He was a real smug, legend in his own mind type. The next week I bought myself a big plasma TV which I put in my family room with a fireplace. I feel kind of sorry for theater owners. They must be losing a lot of business. That&rsquo;s actually another point. It isn&rsquo;t worth your while to do business with blacks. They are more trouble then they are worth. </p>

		<p>Magic Johnson built a multiple theater in LA and named it after himself.  Apparently a lot of foolish Whites went there when it opened and were appalled by the Black goings on.  There were a number of local Black writers who published articles explaining why Blacks talked to the movie screen.  It was hilarious, seeing a bunch of dumb Whites getting a peek at normal Blacks, and the Black elite explaining away, and all very public.  But some Whites won&rsquo;t learn.</p>

<p>I believe it.  But the first thing I noted was that both these articles were taken from television reports, not the press.  Newspaper articles are more careful in their reportage, as they are permanent and considered more &#8220;for the record&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wonder what the LA Times had to say about the incident   &mdash;  - if anything at all!<br>

<p>Well, good luck to you, Granny. You may need it. Basically, all a knife gives you is a sense of self-confidence. But that may be a false sense. Unless you are a self-defense expert, pulling a knife on a thug is not always the best idea. He may have one too, and he could be better at it than you. If a younger, stronger person, more agile person  (or a group!) takes it from you and uses it against you, you&rsquo;ll  be a lot worse off than  if you just gave up your purse in the first place. (That goes for guns too   &mdash;   unless you&rsquo;re an expert.) It is a dilemma, I&rsquo;ll grant, but sometimes you have to decide between your life or your purse. I&rsquo;ll not try to tell you which is more valuable.  That&rsquo;s your own decision to make.</p>
<p>The best solution is just to keep far away from them!</p>

		<p>I live in Lancaster, Calif where this stabbing with the meat thermometer took place. I was surprised that the newspaper said black males, no mention of who the victim was. This is the result of diversity in California. They used to have billboards here that said &#8220;we love the diversity&#8221;. This is the kind of place you don&rsquo;t leave the house after dark and you never honk your car horn at anyone because they will shoot you. Last year a 64 year old man was walking down the street and he was shot in the chest with a bow and arrow and killed by a black guy. It only makes the local news for a day or so, never the MSM.</p>

		<p>18 Anon: An old person who is determined to stick somebody may not be much of a threat to a young person, but unless the &#8220;youth&#8221; has got a gun and plans on pulling the trigger, they will most likely shuffle off, snarling.  <br>
     40+ years ago, some sociologists showed some jailbirds film of people walking down the street, and asked them who they&rsquo;d choose to rob.  The thugs all pretty much chose the same victims, not by age or sex or race, but according to how easy they looked.  A clueless looking 28 year old man was easier prey than a tight-faced old woman in a wheelchair.  Carry the knife, granny, you might get lucky.  </p>

I suspect the cops have always found a way to &#8220;release&#8221; the information to the media as a matter of duty, without trying to be racist about it. They often couched the descriptions in the most nondescript, vague terms possible &hellip;but the media simply refused to report skin color on principle. It&rsquo;s the indoctrination of the press since the 1960s that led to color-blind crime reporting.</p>
<p>&hellip;of course, that persistent color-blind ignorance on behalf of the MSM also led to AmRen. </p>
