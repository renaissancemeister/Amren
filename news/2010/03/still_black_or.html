			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Padgett, Time, March 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Many, if not most, Hispanics in the U.S. think of their ethnicity (also known as Latino) not just in cultural terms but in a racial context as well. It&rsquo;s why more than 40% of Hispanics, when asked on the Census form in 2000 to register white or black as their race, wrote in &#8220;Other&#8221;  &mdash;  and they represented 95% of all the 15.3 million people in the U.S. who did so.</p>
<p>An even larger share of Hispanics, including my Venezuelan-American wife, is expected to report &#8220;Other,&#8221; &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;Latino&#8221; in the race section of the 2010 census forms being mailed to U.S. homes this month. What makes it all the more confusing if not frustrating to them is that Washington continues to insist on those forms that &#8220;Hispanic origins are not races.&#8221; If the Census Bureau lists Filipino and even Samoan as distinct races, Hispanics wonder why they  &mdash;  the product of half a millennium of New World miscegenation  &mdash;  aren&rsquo;t considered a race too. {snip}</p>
<p>Nor are they alone. Arabs, who would seem to have an even stronger race claim than Hispanics do, are trumpeting their own write-in campaign because the Census by default counts them as white  &mdash;  and the bureau announced this week that it has no intention of changing that policy in 2010. Incredibly, the term Arab doesn&rsquo;t even appear on the census form, though other Asian ethnicities, like Indian, are listed as races. (Ironically, part of the problem is that Arab immigrants a century ago petitioned the Federal Government to be categorized as white to avoid discrimination. Today, Arab-American leaders realize how much that move has cost their community in terms of federal aid and legal clout.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Census officials say they&rsquo;re simply adhering to race-category standards laid out for all federal agencies in 1997 by the White House Office of Management and Budget, criteria they confirm will be re-evaluated before the 2020 census. {snip} And Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group in Washington, D.C., says the Hispanic race question so far &#8220;has been hard to reconcile scientifically.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Maria Teresa Kumar, executive director of Voto Latino, a Hispanic civic organization based in Washington, D.C., worries because most Hispanics who do choose between white and black select white. That &#8220;risks leaving a mistaken impression that they enjoy certain socioeconomic opportunities we associate with whites in this country,&#8221; says Kumar, &#8220;when in reality [Hispanics] are near the bottom in areas like education and upward mobility.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many feel the Census also needs to fine-tune its idea of what is and isn&rsquo;t Hispanic. {snip}</p>
<p>All of this should prod the Census Bureau to simplify things for future counts. The Hispanic-origins and race sections should be combined into one, less confusing section that asks folks what ethnic and/or racial group they belong to: white, black, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander or Hispanic. It should (as it already does for some groups on the form) provide space for designating subgroups  &mdash;  like Arabs, for example. (Many Jamaican- and Bahamian-Americans also feel the Census should list their Caribbean origins as a black subgroup.) And it should make clear that respondents can check more than one group. {snip}</p>
<p>Accommodating, if not promoting, multiple ethnic identification seems especially important at a time when a growing number of Americans  &mdash;  including their President  &mdash;  have mixed-race parentage. {snip}<br>

<p>It is things like that, that just make me want to vomit!</p>
<p>The duplicity and outright vileness of nonwhites in manipulatively brutalizing whites across the centuries, is reason enough to never trust them at all in any scenario, let alone celebrate them as &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; injured innocents.</p>
<p>As for the wantonly &ldquo;educated&rdquo; and willfully self-degraded Red traitors like Comrade Padgett, that goes quadruple!</p>
<p>It suffices to ask: who cares if Arabs and &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; consider themselves &ldquo;white&rdquo; or not? We know they are not and should be realistic enough to categorize them as such.</p>
<p>Or put another way:</p>
<p>Arabs of Muslim origin, should be tagged as known potential terrorist interlopers, of inassimilable quality;</p>
<p>And, &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; or &ldquo;Latinos,&rdquo; should be tagged as known valueless alien invaders, that do not conform with the racial and cultural norms of European Spain and its colonial successes, as exemplified by Argentina.</p>
<p>Enough said here!</p>

		<p>Hispanic&rsquo;s of light complexion will lord it over darker Hispanic&rsquo;s and American Black&rsquo;s that they are White. However for some strange reason they like to tell White&rsquo;s that they (Hispanic&rsquo;s) are non-White, or People of Color. The people of Spain are as White as almost any non Scandanavian European country, such as Southern Germany, Italy, or Greece and don&rsquo;t much look like the people of Central or Northern South America. But they too when in America and around American White&rsquo;s many times become non-White or Hispanic. Can someone explain the rational of this mind set?</p>

		<p>I think there should be a group called, for want of a better term, NAMESAn, short for North African / Middle Eastern, South Asian.  Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Pakistanis, Indians, Afghans, Iranians, you name it.  Whites and NAMESAns are probably together in a single, larger group that contains both races (or whatever you want to call our two groups), but we are also distinct.</p>
<p>End the category &#8220;Asian&#8221;, at least as it currently exists, lumping together East Asians and South Asians.  By no means should Japanese and Vietnamese get to choose their own &#8220;top level&#8221; race as they do now.  If they get to choose their ethnicity, it should be as part of an ethnic subset, after they have chosen East Asian or Oriental, and whites should have a specific list of ethnicities we should be able to pick from too, such as Anglo-Saxon, Scottish, Irish, German, etc.</p>
<p>If you force a Hispanic to choose among the races familiar to Americans (White, Black, indian) he will choose White.  But if given the chance to choose Mestizo, many if not most will choose that, so we need to begin using that as a Hispanic-specific racial category.  We want to push as many Hispanics away from picking White as much as possible, so make White last on the list of options.  Mestizo first, then Indian, then Marrano, then Mulatto, then black, then White.  (That&rsquo;s not in the order of the Latin American racial pecking order of course).</p>

When my census form arrives, it&rsquo;s immediately going into the trash where it belongs. To hell with the government.</p>
<p>First of all, you should have already gotten your census form a couple of weeks ago.  Second, why would you do that?  You will just draw unwanted attention to yourself and tax money will be wasted so that some government worker can track you down and get your answers in person.  It is just a simple form that does not ask for any secret, personal information.  Just act like a grown-up and fill it out.  The census is performed every 10 years people, this is not some Obamunist plot. </p>
<p>And please don&rsquo;t give me this nonsense about checking the &#8220;Other&#8221; box and writing in your race as &#8220;Human&#8221; or &#8220;American&#8221; as I have heard many conservatives plan on doing.  I am white and proudly checked the box for &#8220;white&#8221; on my census form.  As race realists, shouldn&rsquo;t we want an accurate racial headcount, so that we know where we stand as a nation?</p>

		<p>Me, I&rsquo;d be happy for the Mestizos and Arabs to be classified as non-white, so long as the FBI is consistent and doesn&rsquo;t count crimes done by Mestizos or Arabs as being due to &#8220;white&#8221; perpetrators.</p>
<p>The Census is kind of weird.  If you&rsquo;re Asian they want to know the particulars   &mdash;   are you Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong?  If you&rsquo;re an American Indian they want to know which tribe you&rsquo;re in (given that we have different treaties with different tribes, and they have status as distinct nations with the United States, there may be some rationale for that one).  But you can be of Irish, Swedish, Italian, Polish, Russian, or Greek origin and your only choice is &#8220;White&#8221;.<br>

		<p>   I see it another way.  They count Hispanics as white so that when statistics like unemployment, crime, government assistance, etc. are calculated as a percentage of the population it looks like &#8220;whites&#8221; are sharing equally.  The truth of course is that those &#8220;whites&#8221; that are actually hispanics are severely inflating the outcome.  Further, blacks want to always be able to play the &#8220;minority&#8221; card and don&rsquo;t want to share that status with the hispanics.</p>

		<p>A small percentage of latinos, maybe 10ish % are actually genetically white. They are not the ones crossing the border illegally, or the ones we see in the streets. I would have no problem if they were counted in the census as white. I live in Colombia 3 months a year. I have a colombian girlfreind that is completely white, even has natural dirty blondish hair, but is latino and speaks no english. If you saw her on the street you would just think that she is a very attractive white american girl. The whites in latin america run most everything and own the big business. Most of the elected government is of the whites, an example is the very white ex pres of mexico, Fox, who is white as I am. There is no discrimination there officially, but the whites are firmly in control and know that they are &#8220;better&#8221; than the darks. There is no affirmative action so the darks that have risen do so on thier own merit. The problems arise when the darks obtain control as exemplified by Chavez in Venezeula or Morales in Bolivia or Ortega in Nicaragua. Generally the darker indian blood latinos find communism attractive and strive often with sucess to lead thier country in that direction. I have gotten off the subject of the census, just wanted to make the point that a few of the latinos are actually white,, but unfortunately they stay in latin america, run things, and we dont really see them here. While I have your attention, if any of you are thinking of leaving the US, Colombia is a real attractive alternative with a hard line right wing government. No major debt, a strong currency, a strong army that could whip Chavez easily and he knows it, and more exports than imports. You wont hear this on the media, they like commie neighbor Chavez more, but its worth looking into if you are serious about leaving the US. When I am able to retire I am thinking this may be the place to be. Sorry I got off the census subject. KF             </p>

		<p>I filled out the census insofar as checking off the boxes of &#8216;white&rsquo; for each member of my household, but no other information. Then I left a sticky note on it with a message saying &#8216;no other information is constitutionally mandated.&rsquo; I, too, was determined there were several whites that would be counted. The rest is none of their business.</p>

		<p>The only reason the race info could be important is for targeting regions for &#8220;special attention,&#8221; due to race distribution.  I think that they want to know where more whites are so that they can target immigration policy toward those regions and better determine which regions for other programs that require special funding (of your tax dollars).</p>
<p>It is completely bogus to claim that we are in or are approaching a post racial America.  The government and statisticians on all sides are obsessed with racial data of all types.</p>
<p>IMO there ought to be no box for racial, national or ethnic origin.  If we truly had a level playing field in America, this information would not be necessary.  And as I have written before, whites would naturally find their way back to the top where the system had removed them previously.</p>

		<p>I got the census form.  There were several special categories for the various types of latino.  What gives?  Why so much special attention?</p>
<p>Arabs do need a box of their own.  They are, however, a vastly mixed race group as well.  There are Arabs who are as white as you and me, and some that are as black as can be.  The Mediterranean has been a race mixing bowl between Africa, Europe and Asia for thousands of years.  In this, the Arabs are like the Latinos.  They can be any race.  I work for a latino lady who is whiter than me.  Go figure.</p>

<p>All that sounds well and good to me, but in looking for a new country if&hellip;er&hellip;WHEN the USA implodes into chaos, personal safety/violent crime rate would be of major importance.  As far as I can surmise, Colombia, while having made a bit of progress in recent years, is still a VERY violent country.

		<p>A census is supposed to be a head count.  Period.  All the government should be entitled to know are the number of people residing in a house.  Why is anything else necessary?  I strongly suspect the government wanting to know who is what race or ethnicity is slick politicians wanting to know which group to pander to and it&rsquo;s never White people.  So until the census is &#8220;color-blind,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t care to participate.</p>

		<p>to  General Lee,<br>
   I hear all he time how violent Medellin is from folks who have never visited and rely on the media for info. I spend a lot of time there and have never ever encountered a dead body on the streets as your freind has claimed.  Medellin is 1/2 the size of New York city and has current crime statistics which show it safer than almost all large US cities. And of course all large cities have crime. 15-20 years ago it was among the most violent cities anywhere, fueled by the drug trade. Then, on a law and order platform Alvaro Uribe was elected pres and he seriously cracked down with help from Bush with Plan Colombia, a 4 billion investment. Uribe is a tough mean sob and exactly what Colombia needed. His way works and should be the focus of university studies of how to bring peace,,, but of course being right wing they dont want studies to show that right wing policies work, along with the fact that he was helped by Bush. <br>
  Medellin is a city of way more contrast than any american city. You are either a have or a have not. There are poor areas of which I would never tread, and that is where the crime is, and I have no reason to visit there.  But the well to do areas, which may I add are beautiful, full of parks, museums, big malls ect,, all the things of an upper class american suburb, exept the costs are much cheaper, and has little crime, way less than the rich areas of american cities. I, as a single man have walked home alone from the resturant/bar area called zona rosa hundreds of times late at night, and walked alone all over the city center in the day many times. Never a problem exept one time I was pick pocketed on the subway,, which was my fault for making it easy on the theif. And you can live there on S Security, I know several americans who have that as thier sole income, and live far far better than trying to live on SS in the usa, if its even possible. If any of you would like to learn more about Medellin of which I think is very viable alternative to the usa if things go bad, I will be returning in august and be glad to show you around. Especially General Lee, please learn more before condemning my favorite place outside the usa.  Thanks,, KF             </p>
