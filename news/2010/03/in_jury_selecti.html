<p>The prospective jurors were being asked to sit in judgment in the case involving the killing of Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant stabbed to death in November 2008 in Patchogue, more than an hour&rsquo;s drive from Manhattan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, as Jeffrey Conroy, 19, becomes the first defendant to go on trial in the case, jury selection has proven difficult, in part because of the views on Latino immigration held by some prospective jurors in Suffolk County.</p>
<p>Last week, after three days of jury selection, about 130 men and women were questioned by the judge, the prosecutor and Mr. Conroy&rsquo;s defense lawyer here in State Supreme Court. Only five were selected; the rest were excused. On Monday, jury selection continued as another roughly 130 were brought in, and more than a dozen were excused by the end of the day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At times, the jury selection had the feel of a call-in show on talk radio, as men and women sounded off on illegal immigration, hate crimes, their ethnic background and the American dream. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several potential jurors were let go because they said they had strong views on illegal immigration and would be unable to be fair and impartial. Others were excused because they said they had Hispanic family members, or were Hispanic themselves, and would side with the victim and his family. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Bruce Barket, a Long Island defense lawyer and a former Nassau County prosecutor, said of the comments being made in this case so far, &#8220;{snip} Race is probably the most dominant unspoken factor in almost every trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>- - Just imagine a White man getting tried for an alleged crime in a mostly Black area.  Imagine.  Suffolk County is predominantly rural White in Long Island New York.  I wonder if lawyers and judges are so concerned about fairness and impartiality when the above White man gets tried in a predominantly Hispanic and Black area??  Does anyone really imagine what prison life is like for White men convicted of crimes?  When Blacks and Hispanics go to jail, it&rsquo;s like a situation of meeting all their friends.  For the White man it&rsquo;s a hell on earth.  And of course were he to join some skinhead gang for self-protection then of course he would be accused of being a racist.  We&rsquo;re damned if we do and we&rsquo;re damned if we don&rsquo;t.  </p>

<p>Hit the nail on the head with that one Mr. Barket!!</p>
<p>I lived in Suffolk County for over 20 years, about 20 minutes from Patchogue.  I can tell you unequivocally that it is, somewhat surprisingly, a hot zone for illegal immigrants.  I&rsquo;ve heard nearby Brentwood, NY referred to numerous times as &#8220;Little Guatemala City&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Well, good luck finding an impartial jury ANYWHERE - this whole country has been overrun with illegals and EVERYBODY is totally fed up with it.  They can change the court venue until Jesus comes and they still won&rsquo;t find folks for a jury who don&rsquo;t have strong views on immigration.</p>

		<p><i>Mr. Lucero&rsquo;s death prompted widespread outrage and exposed racial tensions in Patchogue, where a number of Latinos came forward after the attack to describe muggings and assaults that had them living in fear.</i></p>
<p>Living in fear? Funny, they break into our country, steal our jobs and identities, but it takes this for them to live in fear? Wow, they must have some bravado. Sounds like they believe it&rsquo;s their &#8220;right&#8221; to be a squatter and steal this country, bit by bit. Come to think of it, that IS the case.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that White jury nullification is finally hitting Suffolk Cty. This is a good sign that people are finally waking up. </p>

		<p>Whites need to do what minorities do&hellip; answer the questions the way they need to be answered to get on the jury.  Then reach the correct decision.  Nullification only happens when you sit on a jury and are a part of the verdict.<br>

		<p>The statistical implications of this shows just how deliberately malfeasant our federal government has consistently been in enforcing its own immigration laws.</p>
<p>Until the voters finally kick out lobbyist-owned hacks and rinos like Graham and McCain from the senate, &#8220;our&#8221; Congress will glibly continue betraying all Americans.</p>

		<p>Why are US courts being overwhelmed with cases for illegals?<br>
Courts need not take these cases.  Print them and deport them ASAP. The actions of illegal invasions are deliberately intended to overwhelm US and to exhaust our resources. When are courts going to &#8216;get&rsquo; the reality of RICO activites?? The invasion is replacing US population.  Every effort has been made to accomodate criminal behavior while making US citizens pay for this scourge upon the nation.  The justice system is extremely flawed to cater to noncitizen criminals. It is not rocket science to see the courts and prisons are filled with foreign criminals. The courts are for US citizens.  Illegals do not qualify; deportation is the solution.  If they re-enter then automatic inprisonment may be necessary. The idea that US laws were written for foreigns is preposterous.  The nations laws were written for a cohesive people of common bonds. Now, the US is full of foreigns who do not share our citizenship,values nor language.  It is unlikely to result in peace, happiness and tranquility or a better qualitie of life.  The courts need to review the cost benefits of wasted resources to please foreign interests.  US is now lead by people who are not of American heritage and who believe US is playground for multiethnic gangsters who will never know and seek not to know what American means. Transients have no loyalty to laws/geography.  V</p>
