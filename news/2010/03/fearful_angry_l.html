<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62U4RY20100331">Fearful, Angry Latinos Might Shun Census</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Esteban Israel, Reuters, March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Latinos are the biggest minority in the United States but they could jeopardize a chance to flex their newfound political muscle as millions of them dodge a nationwide census.</p>
<p>Many of the millions of illegal Hispanic immigrants fear that filling in the 10-question census forms could increase their risk of deportation. Others are frustrated with President Barack Obama&rsquo;s slow start on immigration reforms.</p>
<p>A poll by the Pew Research Center showed that one-third of Hispanics have not even heard of the 2010 Census, a $14 billion effort to map the nation&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that more than 50 percent of the Latino community will not participate in the census,&#8221; said Juan Carlos Ruiz, a Peruvian-born activist with the Latino Federation of Greater Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DEPORTATION FEARS</p>
<p>In Mount Pleasant, a heavily-Latino neighborhood in Washington dotted with colorful stores, many residents are there illegally and give vague answers to strangers, their eyes constantly scanning the street.</p>
<p>Waiting at a corner to be picked up for a day&rsquo;s work at a construction site, Jose Ricardo said he didn&rsquo;t see the point of the census.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do it. Politicians never do anything for us,&#8221; said the 35-year old Salvadorean, black woolen cap down low over his eyes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>BOYCOTT?</p>
<p>Some groups are calling for a boycott of the census unless the Obama administration stops the deportations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no other choice left than taking such radical actions as this one. We are obliged by moral responsibility,&#8221; said Rev. Miguel Rivera, head of the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders.</p>
<p>Rivera said 38 percent of his congregation is made up of undocumented immigrants and they are afraid the Census Bureau will pass information on to other federal agencies, despite reassurances that the information is confidential.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Hispanics in Mount Pleasant and across the country complain about the administration&rsquo;s failure to push hard for immigration reform so far in a nation where tortillas outsell bread in some cities.</p>
<p>Obama dedicated only 12 seconds to immigration reform in his State of the Union address in January. Ruiz said it was an &#8220;insult&#8221; to the Latino community.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of frustration, a growing sentiment against the Obama administration for its lack of action,&#8221; said Ruiz, who campaigned for Obama in 2008 and still has a &#8220;Latinos for Obama&#8221; sticker on his laptop.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau promises that the information it gathers will not lead to deportations. &#8220;Everybody needs to be counted. We do not ask someone&rsquo;s migration status, we do not ask someone&rsquo;s social security number. Everything is strictly confidential,&#8221; said its head of publicity, Raul Cisneros.</p>
<p>Some in the streets of Mount Pleasant seem to be getting the message. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very important we get counted. If you&rsquo;re interested in the migration reform then you have to make yourself heard,&#8221; said Alcices, a 42-year old Salvadorean construction worker who skipped the last census in 2000.<br>

		<p>The typical gem of multicultural wretchedness, gleaming in &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; splendor for all to see!</p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;Latinos are the biggest minority in the United States but they could jeopardize a chance to flex their newfound political muscle as millions of them dodge a nationwide census.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Comrade Israel, how could they &ldquo;jeopardize&rdquo; anything? After all, do we not &ldquo;need&rdquo; them, more than they need us? Moreover, they are a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; part of our &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; mosaic and rather &ldquo;enriching,&rdquo; would you not agree? So, why the silly coquettish ethnic trepidations toward a census, that a Latino &ldquo;machismo culture&rdquo; should willingly engage, so as to further &ldquo;emasculate&rdquo; its &ldquo;effete&rdquo; Anglo hosts; </p>
<p>2.) &ldquo;Others are frustrated with President Barack Obama&rsquo;s slow start on immigration reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One step forward, and two steps back toward citizenship, you &ldquo;Latino&rdquo; fools!</p>
<p>Give the &ldquo;savior&rdquo; what it wants now, and perhaps in 2012 it will &ldquo;legalize&rdquo; your worthlessness by 100%. Also, you might just all own Taco Bell franchises as well; particularly, if Federal McHospitals are attached to them;</p>
<p>3.) Finally, &ldquo;Rivera said 38 percent of his congregation is made up of undocumented immigrants and they are afraid the Census Bureau will pass information on to other federal agencies, despite reassurances that the information is confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just wondering Comrade &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; Rivera, what does the other 62% of your congregation that are actual citizens, think about your holier-than-thou antics? Or put another way, have donations dropped recently in the collection plates?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

They should shun the census and they shouldn&rsquo;t be counted.</p>
<p>Using illegal immigrants to boost numbers so states get more money is a betrayal of the purpose of the census. That states go all out to get more people just so they can get more money is outrageous. They don&rsquo;t seem to understand the principle of diminished return.</p>
<p>PS: What for &#8216;sampling&rsquo; to re-emerge as the answer to this problem.</p>

		<p>Let &#8216;em shun the census!! Why should states with large populations of illegal alien adults who CANNOT even vote be given more congressional representaion?! I love how the article says that they might not be able to &#8220;flex their newfound political muscle&#8221; if they avoid participation. What political muscle is this genius writer Estaban Israel talking about?! Why don&rsquo;t whites start flexing their massively bigger political muscle by demanding that E-verify become mandatory, birth-right citizenship be eliminated and an indefinite moratorium on legal immigration be enacted. </p>

		<p>This can be spun both ways.  If they get counted, their legal (and equally Hispanic) neighbors get strengthened representation in Congress  &mdash;   kinda like the three-fifths rule all over again.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if they&rsquo;re undercounted, then they&rsquo;ll crow that the problem has been exaggerated by us and there&rsquo;s no need to do anything rash, like enforce the law.</p>
<p>Note, too, that the boycott threat is very real to Democrats, because if large enough it will cost them seats, for a whole decade no less.  So they may indeed buckle, if that&rsquo;s the word.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the Palmer raids, whatever good they may have done, were essentially a Democratic administration shrewdly manipulating Republican states <i>on Census Day</i>.</p>

		<p>I can tell you that plenty of Hispanics have heard about the Census here in soCA, because I applied for a job with them alongside of a roomful of Hispanics.  Nope, I didn&rsquo;t get hired - I&rsquo;m white and pushing 65, but I do speak Spanish.  Guess they want that Latino flavor here in El-Lay!</p>

		<p>I am so sick of hearing the word &#8220;fearful&#8221; in the same sentence with illegals. They are not fearful. If they were, they would stay home and demand their own leaders help them. They know they can just walk in, colonize and overwhelm this nation with their crimes and nothing will be done except our country will pour more money into that violent, corrupt nation of Mexico.</p>

<p>The correct term is  &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221;, Rev. Rivera.  Or, in a simplier word: &#8220;invaders&#8221;!</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t give us that &#8220;moral&#8221; pitch. It doesn&rsquo;t hold water. Since when it it moral to support people who have violated our sovereignty and demonstrated contempt for our laws?  They are law-breakers, Rev. Rivera!</p>
<p>If only we had a strong leader, somewhere!  No more political pandering!  No more groveling and apologizing!   What we need is another Napoleon   &mdash;  - a Charles Martel   &mdash;    someone who would take the bull by the horns and put a stop to all this nonsense. Someone who would step up to the plate and do what needs to be done.<br>

		<p>Does even our ignorant government expect that a ginormous group of people who shun our laws, regulations and intentionally live beneath the radar will fill out a piece of paper saying that they&rsquo;re here? Even I wouldn&rsquo;t fill it out if I were a criminal hiding from the law.</p>

		<p>If the truth came out that there&rsquo;s 50 million hostile aliens in the country while the ruling elite looks the other way, nay permits them to invade, there&rsquo;s going to be a monumental backlash. Hispanics know they are not wanted by native born, non-Hispanic Americans. However, they are definitely not fearful, they avoid contact with the government because that could jeopardize their criminal activities of rape, fraud, robbery, drug running, and murder against white Americans.</p>

		<p>Hey, &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Rivera,</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you tell that 38% of your congregation to read their BIBLES?  Especially the parts about being in submission to the authorities over us?  Oh, and also those parts about how sinful lying, stealing and coveting is!  Is it just that you want the money they throw into the collection plate?  Or is the fact that they look like you and speak the same language as you, Reverend RIVERA, the reason why you think they should be above the law?</p>

<p>Yeah, politicians do nothing for them, nothing except let them come and stay here, work with no or fraudulent documents, collect welfare, etc. Nope, nothing at all.</p>
<p>As a few have touched on here, how do supposedly regenerate, born-again (born of the Spirit and not of the flesh) Christians invade another&rsquo;s country, take its jobs, etc.? My suspicion is that most of these mestizos aren&rsquo;t really Christians at all, but merely &#8220;religious&#8221; (i.e. they go through the motions.)</p>
