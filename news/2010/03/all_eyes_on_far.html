<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/03/geert-wilders-dutch-polls">All Eyes on Far-Right Geert Wilders As Dutch Go to the Polls</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ian Traynor, Guardian (London), March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Dutch went to the polls today to elect local authorities in a ballot seen as a gauge of the national mood and the strength of the far right, 10 days after the government collapsed and three months before national elections.</p>
<p>With almost 400 local authorities being elected, the focus was on only two, the votes in the capital The Hague and the central town of Almere, because of the campaign by the anti-Muslim populist Geert Wilders to establish his Freedom party in local government for the first time.</p>
<p>Wilders, who likens the Qur&rsquo;an to Hitler&rsquo;s Mein Kampf and wants Muslim immigrants deported, is bidding fair to win the general election in June, with the latest opinion polls giving him 27 of the 150 seats in The Netherlands&rsquo; highly fragmented political scene.</p>
<p>The maverick rightwinger is expected at the House of Lords on Friday on an invitation from the UK Independence Party for a screening of his incendiary anti-Islamic film, Fitna, after the Home Office barred him from entering Britain last year, a ban that was rescinded.</p>
<p>Today the town halls in The Hague and Almere were under heavy security because of the tension fanned by the Freedom party campaign. In both towns and elsewhere scores of men and women turned up to vote wearing headscarves, in an ironic protest against Wilders&rsquo;s demand for a tax on Muslim headgear and for the wearing of headscarves to be banned in all public buildings.</p>
<p>His Freedom party is running for only two local authorities because of a lack of resources and candidates.</p>
<p>While local elections in Holland are usually a subdued affair focused on issues such as cycle paths and rubbish collection, today&rsquo;s poll was dominated by immigration and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The coalition government of Christian and social democrats fell 10 days ago because the Labour party, led by Wouter Bos, the finance minister, refused to extend the presence of 2,000 Dutch troops in Afghanistan who are to be withdrawn from August. It was the first Nato government to fall because of the war and the collapse looks likely to end the career of Jan Peter Balkenende, the Christian Democrat prime minister in office for eight years. The Afghan pullout is popular and Labour has risen in the polls as a result. But Wilders appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the political disarray.</p>
<p>Voter turnout in The Hague and Almere was several points up today on four years ago, suggesting the Freedom party could do well. In Almere, a new town in central Holland with a population of nearly 200,000 and hardly any immigrants, Wilders&rsquo;s party was being tipped to win. In The Hague the contest was more even, with Labour and liberals also expected to do well. In European elections last summer the Freedom party came second, trouncing Labour in its heartland cities of the western and northern coasts.</p>
<p>A Wilders win in the Dutch capital would be a sensation. Polls predict he could triple his vote at the general election.</p>
<p>Several centre and leftwing parties have erected a cordon sanitaire around Wilders, vowing not to coalesce with him in government. But the Christian Democrats and some rightwing liberals are hedging their bets.<br>

		<p>So when the King calls for Mr. Wilders to form a government the liberals will refuse to cooperate.  Isn&rsquo;t that denying the people their democraticly elected choice?  Why don&rsquo;t the liberals just call for a Marxist dictatorship if they do not believe in democracy?  Too bad the King just can&rsquo;t order &#8220;off with their heads&#8221; and move on!</p>

		<p>It would be awesome if Wilders became PM but how can he do so with only 27 seats?  Also, I wonder if the EU would do to Holland if Wilders became PM what they did to Austria when Haider&rsquo;s party won just a few seats?</p>

		<p>Something out of context:</p>
<p>Do you guys know that during the period 1530 to 1789 about 1,25 million White men, women, and children were enslaved by the Muslims? So how come I&rsquo;ve never heard of this before?! And yet I hear anti-White propaganda day after day after day! Whites can only be the bad guys but never the victims! I&rsquo;m so angry right now my blood is boiling! </p>
<p>https://bnp.org.uk/2010/02/time-for-a-memorial-to-the-british-victims-of-islamic-slaving/</p>
<p><br>
And what about the eeeeeeeevil Christian Crusades, how many times have you heard this is what started the clash with the Muslim world?! Well, apparently this is also a myth!</p>

		<p> At least the Guardian gave a pretty even-handed account of what seems likely to happen in this by-election. No cherry-picking of any negative polls for Wilders that they could find, as the mainstream media in the U.S. routinely do where conservative or White Nationalist groups are concerned.</p>
<p> There was one little bit of editorializing that I noticed, though. Why is his film &#8220;Fitna&#8221; necessarily either &#8220;anti-Islamic&#8221; or &#8220;incendiary&#8221;? Whose opinion is that? Maybe it just tells the truth, and that in itself is considered incendiary by the Left!</p>

<p><br>
Yeah, that&rsquo;s what they say <i>now</i>. If Geert Wilders actually gets in a position to run a minority govt   &mdash;   but needs some help to make it happen   &mdash;   I&rsquo;m guessing enough of those &#8220;Christian Democrats and some rightwing liberals hedging their bets&#8221; will cut the cordon sanitaire and go over to Wilders&rsquo; side. It isn&rsquo;t quite &#8220;respectable&#8221; for them to endorse Wilders just yet. But they should be coming out of the closet soon enough&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;And when they do, what the Marxists and the Mohammedans want suddenly won&rsquo;t matter much anymore, because the Netherlands will once again be in the hands of people who are (a) Dutch, and (b) not insane. </p>

		<p>27 of 150 will be a shame hanging over the Dutch for all eternity. Heidi babe, Morris, Mark, Richard, and Abe and Ben need to rush over to the Netherlands and begin teaching tolerance to the intolerant.  The far right extremists could break out in violence at any moment by saying something that will hurt the feelings of immigrants.  When will we stop the hate? We need to teach the Dutch right wingers that the evil is in them and the good is in their perceived enemies, which aren&rsquo;t really enemies, but are only reflections of their hateful prejudices that they need to question and change.</p>

Had the Germans stopped the Allies on the beaches in &#8216;44 history would be different and the same thing will be said of the civilized world&rsquo;s failure to stop the spread of the hateful muslim ideaology.

<b>&#8220;Dutch anti-Islam leader is major winner in polls.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>So there it is!   I have been watching and watching for this news.   At 2AM, I still see NOTHING at all on the American news channels. More surprisingly, there&rsquo;s nary a word about the Dutch elections on the BBC either!  You would certainly think the British would be interested. I guess they&rsquo;re wringing their hands anc wrangling how they&rsquo;re going to spin this unsettling news.  Only Reuters has thus far reported it.</p>

		<p>  It seems that Wilders is ideologically like the GOP, except harder on Muslims.  He is not a racialist and is not pro-white.  He considers the Front National &#8220;fascists.&#8221;  He won&rsquo;t have anything to do with the BNP, but collaborates with groups like UKIP and the EDL, which are used by the establishment to draw away support from genuine nationalists, much like talk radio and Fox News are used in the USA to distract &#8220;angry white males&#8221; from the real issues.  It&rsquo;s disappointing to see people on Amren get so excited about this guy without bothering to research what he actually believes.  It seems likely that Wilders&rsquo; career as a &#8220;right wing&#8221; leader, which only started in 2004, is a calculated move to ride the support of Pim Fortuyn&rsquo;s followers, who were left without a leader after his assassination.  </p>
<p>Here is a quote from a recent article about Wilders from the Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;On Friday, after successfully appealing against the Home Office ban, Mr Wilders will return to Britain at the invitation of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to show his controversial film to an invited audience at the House of Lords. The English Defence League is expected to demonstrate in his support and Muslim groups are all but certain to mount protests.</p>
<p>To his enemies, the 46-year-old Dutchman is an old-fashioned racist demagogue in a new suit; a bottle-blond bigot. To his growing ranks of supporters he is a champion of free speech, a bulwark against what he calls &ldquo;the Islamic invasion of Holland&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue of militant Islam is the greatest issue facing our Judeo-Christian culture,&rdquo; Lord Pearson said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree that the Koran should be banned but we want it discussed &hellip; mild Muslims should stand up and debate their militant co-religionists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Wilders has sought to distance himself and his party from the traditional standard-bearers of the extreme Right in Europe, such as Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front in France and the late Jörg Haider of the Freedom Party in Austria. He has made no contact with the BNP. &ldquo;My allies are not Le Pen and Haider,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very afraid of being linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups.&rdquo; His prime political role models are said to be Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Good luck to Geert! Let&rsquo;s hope he isn&rsquo;t ostracized like Haider but after the BNP setting a precedent, I&rsquo;m sure that isn&rsquo;t likely to happen. The Far Right WILL gain increasing acceptance in W. Europe this century. Every European country should have its own Putin.</p>

<p>Thatcher and Churchill: who made no move whatsoever to stem the flood of immigration, and under whom the invasion proceeded apace!  </p>
<p>As for &#8220;the extreme right&#8221;,  that is nonsense.  They are &#8220;extreme right&#8221; only in the eyes of the &#8220;extreme left&#8221;, such as the British (and other European) media. Otherwise, he&rsquo;s really quite moderate, even timid, in the face of what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not overestimate him!  He&rsquo;s not interested in <i> &#8220;stopping immigration&#8221;</i>&hellip; only in curbing the advance of Islam. That, and ONLY that!  </p>
<p>Immigration, from everywhere, can proceed as long as they&rsquo;re not Moslems. His concern for preserving Holland is only religious/cultural, not  racial.   Like virtually every other brainwashed Dutchman, he is thoroughly anti-racist.  Thus, he has little in common with us.  He wouldn&rsquo;t touch a &#8220;racist&#8221; with a twelve-foot pole!</p>

		<p>The longest attempted conquest in history was the siege of Christian Europe by the Islamic tribes. I believe it lasted approximately 500 years. It ended with the defeat of Islamic warriors in the battlefield, which is how things such as this usually end.<br>
I guess one could say hurrah for the 21st century inasmuch as this is unfolding in elections and courts but on the other hand when is this desire for conquest to end?<br>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if Geert Wilders says he isn&rsquo;t friends/allies with Haider (RIP) the BNP, Le Pen.</p>
<p>He and his party are standing up for our people against the NW immigration invasion, and calling out the Islamic extremists as the #1 enemy.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders&rsquo; program obviously works. The BNP is using almost the identical program.</p>
<p>This program works for the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party. It works fine for WN in the USA.</p>
<p>Just stand up against PC, cultural Marxism and massive non traditional immigration - make ugly NW Muslim extremists the #1 propaganda enemy.</p>
<p>It works - use it and you/we will win.</p>
<p>Do American WN/populist have something against winning?</p>
<p>(Answer is yes they do - in particular Libertarians love to lose, it makes them feel superior to the uneducated masses)</p>

    The Netherlands has such a strong liberal tradition that I doubt a more right wing party would be viable. Wilders may not be all that I would like in a politican but he is turning the Dutch electorate more toward immigration restriction.</p>

<p>Excellent post from ATBOTL who seems to understand the situation very well!  I have been suspicious of Wilders all along, who gets press attention and apparently enjoys generous funding (from somewhere), by the way.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It seems [his] career as a &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; leader&hellip; is a calculated move to ride the support of Pim Fortuyn&rsquo;s followers, who were left without a leader &hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Aha!  Much the same as another neo-con did in France to take away support from Le Pen who seemed dangerously close to winning. (Can&rsquo;t have anything like THAT!&hellip;can we?)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite it all, Wilders seems to be the best the Netherlands can put forth at the present, so I wish him well. He wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with us at Amren, but he&rsquo;s the best they&rsquo;ve got. He can express concern about &#8220;Islam&#8221;, and that&rsquo;s dangerous enough and may yet get him a prison term, but an openly racialist/nationalist candidate would be completely outlawed in the Netherlands and wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance. He wouldn&rsquo;t get anywhere but in jail.</p>

		<p>10 ATBOTL:</p>
<p>Geert Wilders thinks he&rsquo;s being cute and tolerant by trying to say he&rsquo;s nothing like those &#8220;fascists&#8221; in the BNP and Le Pen&rsquo;s FN, but the only person he&rsquo;s fooling with that rhetoric is himself.  He&rsquo;s not fooling the left, he&rsquo;s not fooling the same leftist commmissars who want him in the same cell with Nick Griffin, he&rsquo;s not fooling his voters who would be the same people voting BNP if they lived in the UK or FN if they lived in France or Vlaams Belang if they lived in Belgium.</p>
<p>I agree with you that Wilders isn&rsquo;t perfect.  But the best is the enemy of the good.  And since we have higher standards at AR, the best is even the enemy of the decent, fair and mediocre.  </p>

		<p>I think ATBOTL#10 stated the case extremely well&hellip; and also #14. I have nothing further to add to their posts, as they have said it all.  </p>
<p>Wilders is the Netherlands&rsquo; neocon, their equavalent of a Sarkozy to pre-empt the political Right from a rightist/nationalist victory.  He gives the rightists/nationalists a feeling of victory, but only as much as will please The Powers That Be (eg. anti-Islam).  I&rsquo;m afraid it will be nothing more.  What is he going to do about the big question   &mdash;   IMMIGRATION?  (And no, I&rsquo;m not talking about just Moslems.)</p>
