			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Weston, Gates of Vienna, March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is understandable that the vast majority of the heavily propagandised English populace remain unaware of the continental shift in immigrant demographics and birth rates that will relegate the indigenous population of England under the age of 40 to ethnic minority status in their homeland within twenty years.</p>
<p>Understandable, admittedly, but if these recipients of a progressive education and 24/7 cradle-to-grave state-sponsored brainwashing could remove their liberal blinkers and gaze in horror at their surroundings through the eyes of their grandparents, then they could only have themselves to blame, because their dispossession was carried out in full view of those that would not see, and in retrospect how could there be any other outcome than gradual extinction when one considers exactly what out socialist rulers have carried out over the last few decades?</p>
<p>1. Identified a small yet wealthy country populated by a rapidly declining indigenous race representing less than 1% of the global population, and whose territorial homeland makes up less than 1% of global habitable area.</p>
<p>2. Established a Welfare State with a legal requirement to provide free housing, food, education, health, translation services and pin money to those in need, with the most needy being judged solely on the number of children they have.</p>
<p>3. Thrown open the doors of this tiny country to the teeming billions of the poverty-stricken third world, whilst making sure the multiple wives of Muslim males fully understood that the more children they produced, the bigger the house and welfare cheque they would receive from the State, even though polygamy is illegal in England.</p>
<p>4. Encouraged the new arrivals to take pride in the culture and religion of the third-world country they had escaped from and &#8220;educated&#8221; them into developing an unhealthy animosity toward their host country&rsquo;s imperialist and oppressive past.</p>
<p>5. Demonised the ancient and indigenous population as institutionally racist from the age of five and enacted &#8220;hate&#8221; laws which are then predominately used to criminalise and silence the indigenous people who speak out against their territorial and cultural dispossession.</p>
<p>6. Praised multiculturalism as a positive and Islam as a religion of peace, then sat back to watch the results of their social experiment  &mdash;  what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Liberal progressives residing in fine mansions on Hampstead Heath will tell you nothing could go wrong; that mass immigration is nothing other than a positive boon, an unarguable and incontrovertible truth that must be patiently and condescendingly explained to the uneducated and the unwashed, even as the Arabella Allendes and Montmorency Guevaras over-glamorise and under-pay the scurrying, forelock tugging, cute little brown people whose multi-hued efforts in tending to the gardens, kitchen, laundry and children of the servant owning socialist class enable the latter to do the more important things in life, such as denouncing capitalism in between producing money making yet soul-destroying reality TV shows.</p>
<p>For the white working class, however, those long-forgotten stalwarts of the country who failed to play their designated role in the long term plans of Mr Marx and Mr Engels, thereby earning the enduring hatred of the cuckolded intellectuals, it means nothing other than population replacement, or in the cruder yet more honest language of the betrayed working man rarely encountered at progressive Hampstead dinner parties, ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>Is this too strong a description? Patricia Morgan of The Salisbury Review doesn&rsquo;t think so. In 2006 she wrote an article entitled Ethnic Cleansing in East London which focussed primarily on Tower Hamlets and the dispossession of white working-class Londoners who, having survived Adolf Hitler and the Luftwaffe, subsequently failed to hold back the tidal wave of Socialism and multiculturalism so avidly promoted by the British Labour Party.</p>
<p>Ms Morgan recounts a conversation with a left-wing friend who was slowly becoming aware of the results of Socialisms warped multicultural ideology:</p>
<p>&#8220;When one of my old Labour Party acquaintances expressed anxiety over Islamic terrorism, I asked him why he had always been so keen on getting as many immigrants here as possible. He told me that he had been &#8216;trying to make the revolution&rsquo;. So, while it had not been possible to storm Buckingham Palace and set up Soviets in Westminster, you could still change the population and supplant the hated &#8216;other&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as with all Socialist policies, the anti-Midas touch of the Liberal/Left duly performed as it has always performed, and the hated &#8220;other&#8221; turned out not be the bowler-hatted bourgeoisie, but the cloth-capped working class English themselves, whose na√Øve belief in Socialism&rsquo;s promise of a Brave New World failed to understand the chosen people were not white but brown, not Christian but Islamic, and not English but members of any third-world race whose culture was irredeemably at odds with that of the host culture.</p>
<p>Patricia Morgan goes on to describe the accelerating displacement of the indigenous East-Enders, as the new arrivals from Bangladesh went straight to the head of the housing queue by dint of their family size, averaging in good Muslim tradition seven children per wife. You will note I do not say per couple, because many Muslim men in Tower Hamlets routinely have four wives each, all &#8220;legally&#8221; supported by the British State in order they may father up to twenty-eight children in a literal tsunami of polygamous demographic warfare imported from one-well villages in Bangladesh to the streets of our forefathers via Heathrow Terminal 1.</p>
<p>Frank Dobson, a Labour MP and traitor who attained Ministerial rank in Tony Blair&rsquo;s cabinet, was on hand to astutely encourage the displacement of his party&rsquo;s historical core vote. Speaking to a Bangladeshi audience in Tower Hamlets a few years ago, he encouraged them to help themselves to everything on offer from the State; nothing was too much, and no matter how much was taken, it could never fully recompense the oppressed of the non-white world for the misery and depredations they had historically suffered under the boot of the racialist-imperialist-oppressor that was Britain.</p>
<p>And today we live with the results of this treason and betrayal. Tower Hamlets is now called &#8220;Banglatown&#8221; where, with the exception of a few vicars otherwise known as clerical punch bags, there are virtually no whites left, just as there are very few whites in many other areas of London where the non-white population now amounts to 42% with a full one-third of all &#8220;Londoners&#8221; born outside the UK.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And England&rsquo;s other cities are going precisely the same way in precisely the same manner. The non-indigenous birth rate now averages an extraordinary 35% nationally, which realistically means 60-70% in the cities alone, thus consigning indigenous English children in Birmingham, Bradford, Oldham, London, Luton and Leicester to an ethnic minority in their own land where up to 150 different languages are spoken in their schools; a fate awaiting English children in all our cities and towns within a decade, and the entire country before 2030.</p>
<p>Tracking ethnic demographics is not an exact science, but it is generally recognised that the ethnic minority population of Britain is approximately 15% which equates to 9 million out of a population of 60 million.</p>
<p>However, the indigenous British population contains many old people, leaving only 50% of the population under 40 years of age, whilst the non-indigenous population tend to be much younger by dint of their higher birth rate, with 75% typically representing those aged under 40.</p>
<p>If we use these statistics, the population of Great Britain under the age of 40 looks like this:</p>
<p>Indigenous Population 2009: 25.5 million</p>
<p>Non-Indigenous Population 2009: 6.75 million</p>
<p>But the current birth rate differentials cause the indigenous population to decline by 25% per generation whilst the non-indigenous population has historically doubled per generation, with the Muslim population growing ten times faster than the rest of society.</p>
<p>If we project this data forward to 2030, the figures look like this:</p>
<p>Indigenous Population 2030: 19 million</p>
<p>Non-Indigenous Population 2030: 13.5 million</p>
<p>On top of this we need to take the following into account:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Approximately 200,000 Brits emigrate every year.<br>
	<br>
‚Ä¢	Approximately 200,000 legal immigrants arrive every year.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢	Approximately 300,000 illegal immigrants enter England every year in order to reach government productivity targets.</p>
<p>If we project this data forward to 2030, the figures look like this:</p>
<p>Indigenous Population 2030: 15 million</p>
<p>Non-Indigenous Population 2030: 23.5 million</p>
<p>To become an ethnic minority in your own country over just a few decades suggests that government policy, as has recently been revealed, was indeed to ethnically cleanse the English from their homeland, although the multiculturalists who committed this wicked act of treason and betrayal never couched it in quite such plain language, preferring instead to frame mass immigration as a means of achieving social objectives.</p>

		<p>Does he have these numbers right? Aren&rsquo;t those from the caribbean, who were Born in England, considered English and not foreign? No wonder the sensitive-folks want deny the relevance of the word &#8216;indigenous british&rsquo; and seem to want to make it a hate crime to even use the word. </p>

		<p>What is suspicious for this being intentional ethnic cleansing is that when the government realized that their indigenous population was declining they did not offer incentives for the native population to reproduce. They could have done it with financial and educational  incentives and public service programs. Instead they opened their borders to a different ethnic population and encouraged that alien population to reproduce and maintain their own ethnic identity severely disabling the host population. Obviously maintaining ethnic identity is important to the government only if it is non-white ethnic identity. Same thing is happening in all white countries. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Ethnic cleansing&#8221; is far too kind an expression.  If the British people are not allowed to flourish in Britain, where then, are they to survive?  I think the correct term is &#8220;genocide&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Ethnics must be 30% of England&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>The good things are attitudes are changing and us English are still having children, not many, but enough. Its dark outside but dawn is around the corner.</p>

<p>I know that some of the longer lasting posters and readers here at AR, probably get sick of my verbal eviscerations of &ldquo;enlightened multiculturalism&rsquo;s&rdquo; Marxist underpinnings. However, it is always important to drive the point home when such as the above quoted Red nonsense is available. Just what is the anonymous British Comrade driving at, when the ignorantly disclosed whimsy, &ldquo;trying to make the revolution&rdquo; is intoned?</p>
<p>It is very simple, being too gutless and rejected &ldquo;to storm Buckingham Palace and set up Soviets in Westminster,&rdquo; this &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; of privilege and fantasy, must cravenly find a Trojan Zebra to do its dirty work. Hence, the Rainbow Plague it has created; thus, achieving nothing, but destruction and misery for all in the equation it wishes to &ldquo;change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the Bolsheviks and Maoists were of a better stripe in this context; Stalin only demanded Marxist-Leninist Russification, and Mao a Red Chinese Cultural Revolution. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!<br>

		<p>Mass third-world immigration has been the tool of the left to take over the Western nations since the end of World War II.  In the United States the &#8220;neo-conservatives&#8221;, who are also leftists, are promoting such policies to ensure the United States becomes, in the words of Ben Wattenberg, a &#8220;Universal Nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for England, good luck to the BNP and may they prevail against the attacks of the left-wing establishment there.</p>

		<p>This is ethnic cleansing of the worst kind - racial suicide.  But for the life of me it makes no sense whatsoever.  </p>
<p>1) It is hard for me to believe that all, or even a majority, of the people who orchestrated this race replacement policy are unmarried, single, childless orphans with no family to survive them.  Since most do have heirs why would they want their kin to suffer the fate of a despised minority in their ancestral homelands?  This seems pathological.</p>
<p>2) As for the whole declining population explanation, I do not believe it.  I feel part of the downward trend in white births is due to third world immigration coupled with a declining economy/standard of living and the prospects for a better future.  Unlike &#8220;people of color&#8221; whites generally plan their children.  Whites who are economically distressed, surrounded by hostile aliens and with a bleak view of the future are likely to delay child bearing and reduce the number of children they eventually do have.  And let us not forget that births rise and fall over generations, so any birth dearth prior to the third world takeover was probably a natural variation.</p>
<p>3) A declining and eventually smaller, yet stable population, could be a boon both economically and environmentally.  Look at all those little tribes in the Amazon.  These tribes have survived for hundreds of years with both a small breeding population and a steady state economy (at least until Westerners arrive).  Granted, Amazon Indians have a very simple life style compared to our own but I truly believe such a steady state society is possible in a modern context.</p>
<p>4) Is it possible that these traitors originally believed their own propaganda and now, that the evidence is in and multiculturalism is a fraud and a failure, are to stubborn to admit their mistake and have decided to go down with the ship.  Rather like Hitler wanting all Germans to perish if the war was lost rather than lose face.  Or the Japanese high command who would have sacrifice every man, woman and child rather than surrender?  Unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have a supreme leader (like Hirohito) who can say &#8220;it&rsquo;s over guys, time to change course&#8221;.<br>

		<p>There is a big, big part of me that doesn&rsquo;t have much sympathy for the British. They were the very first White country to allow non-White immigration - as far back as 1948. They played a key role in legitimatizing it and opened up this Pandora&rsquo;s box for other countries. They did not heed the warning of their great prophet Enoch Powell. They have continued to vote for the vile marxist Labour party which has relentlessly continued to destroy them. They have an electoral alternative in the BNP - but they won&rsquo;t vote for them. </p>

		<p>In a shift in Labour&rsquo;s approach, John Denham, the Communities Secretary, has said that social class is sometimes more important than race in determining the progress someone makes in life. His attempt to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; from more than a decade of Labour thinking on racial equality and social policy comes after the British National Party made electoral breakthroughs in Labour heartlands last year. In another departure, Mr Denham also accepted that the unprecedented levels of immigration Labour has overseen have had &ldquo;a big impact&rdquo; on race relations in Britain.  The BNP last year won its first seats in the European Parliament after a campaign that argued that the main political parties have abandoned the white working class. Some Labour MPs have said that the Government has to do more to respond to the concerns of white working class voters. In response, Mr Denham has already revised rules to allow councils to favour the children of long-standing residents when allocating council houses and announced a ¬£12 million fund to address the sense grievance felt by people in poor white areas.   Mr Denham said there is &#8220;no evidence&#8221; to show that the white working class are held back simply because of their race. Rather, he said, they suffer &#8220;social disadvantage&#8221; because of their class.  He also accepted that immigration had played a part<br>
and gained a political voice through the BNP and other far right groups. The Conservatives said Labour had been forced to admit that white working class people had been neglected. Caroline Spelman, the shadow communities secretary, said: &ldquo;In the past decade the Government has framed its rhetoric on social inequality around marginalised groups and it now appears to be repositioning itself when it sees that approach has failed&rdquo;  She added: &ldquo;While Gordon Brown has played class warfare politics, social mobility has gone backwards under Labour.&rdquo; It must be stressed that this government refuse to recognise the White English race although they do acknowledge that there are white scottish, white gypsies and white irish. How they can accuse a &#8216;non-existent&rsquo; race of racism against other races is simply a product of their warped Kafkaesque communist &#8216;news-speak&rsquo; attitude and determination to eradicate the largest racial group in England and replace it with non-White immigrants and their progeny. </p>

		<p>Istvan is very insightful.</p>
<p>The collective suicide of Europeans via 3rd world immigration is not &#8220;politics&#8221;, it is a collective psychosis which transcends politics or economics. </p>
<p>But the issue of population attrition is more than a red herring:<br>
capitalist societies cannot endure steady state, zero growth: any corporation that fails to grow perishes. </p>
<p>Zero population growth in Europe with ZERO net immigration would be great, provided we can adjust capitalism. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the white population is falling TOO FAST in most places. </p>
<p>Europe has a dirty little secret too: most of the few whites who are successfully reproducing are low grade incompetents subsidized by the childless cognitive elite (but the elites are taking slightly more responsibility for procreating lately).</p>
<p>That menas that minus immigration cataclysm, Europe is in massive decilne eugenically. </p>
<p>If there is a future for whites, it is EUGENIC future. </p>

Maybe the English can take a lesson from Gandhi on how he drove the British out of India.</p>
<p>After all, Gandhis&rsquo; message was that Indians should have autonomy over their own nation. </p>

		<p>I also have the same question as poster #8&rsquo;s first point.  These liberals all have children.  Why would they want to ruin the future of their own children?  </p>
<p>What do they get if their kids are the only white kids in a class filled with violence prone voodoos?  It is extremely self-destructive and delusional.</p>
<p>Do they believe the voodoos and others will carry on the social justice movement?  That movement is still carried on almost exclusively by white liberals, even after all the demographic change.  </p>
<p>Even the environmentalist movement is still 99.999% white.  Will the non-whites, when they are a majority, care about protecting rare minnows and defenseless tress?  I think not.  Look at the environments in their home lands.</p>
<p>Any non-whites in the social justice movement speak only of getting more for their people.  They never speak of white rights or harmony with whites from their own end.</p>

		<p>Where, then, is the Monarchy in the face of all this?  Nominally, at least, the Queen is the head of State.  Why can&rsquo;t Her Royal Majesty, her son, Prince Charles, his children, and the various dukes, earls, counts and barons say something?  Their kingdom is about to go under, and yet they prefer, almost as an act of organized decadence, to remain silent.  </p>

		<p>The EHRC employs more than 500 members of staff at an annual cost of ¬£70m. It has also come under intense criticism from the government spending watchdogs for the &#8220;patently flawed&#8221; merger of three equality bodies that led to its creation at a cost to the taxpayer of almost ¬£39m. Last week its head of finance, Tracy Allison, became the latest high profile employee to resign. In past months the commission has fought back, publishing widely reported inquiries into the abuse of workers in supermarkets and arguing against full-body airport scanners. Now I don&rsquo;t know how the rest of you think but to me the use of over 500 people and ¬£70 million per annum (plus lawyers fees) seems a tad over the top to investigate supermarket personnel and oppose full-body scanners in airports when surely they should be supporting all efforts to combat terrorism. However, there does seem to be a great deal left in the slush fund to finance the real agenda. The labour party (that&rsquo;s the government) actually set up the EHRC to harass the British National Party (BNP) at every opportunity, including persuading the BBC and MSM not to report anything positive but to make brief comments which must include the words &#8216;racist&rsquo;, &#8216;nazi&rsquo; and &#8216;holocaust deniers&rsquo; (or similar) even though these were not quoted as used within the particular news item under brief scrutiny. Better to read the full report, it includes a photo of Trevor Phillips, their glorious leader. White English he ain&rsquo;t. No surprise there then&hellip; racial equality my foot!</p>

		<p>Any true Brit who votes for Labour or Liberals in the coming election is an idiot, a traitor and a fool. They would be voting for genocide - their own.</p>
<p>Why? For &#8220;a free tv license and bus pass,&#8221; amongst other things. For a good look at what pansies some of the people from my ancestral homeland have become, take a gander at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1YtLMrPTD0" rel="nofollow">this Lie-bour commercial</a>, featuring &#8220;comedian&#8221; Eddie Izzard. It&rsquo;s depressing as hell. And note that the only minority in the commercial is the only one not praising government handouts, because that would&rsquo;ve reminded the viewers how many immigrants are welfare dependents.</p>
<p>I love Great Britain. I love its people. I hope they&rsquo;ll wake up come election-time and realize the incalculable, possibly irreparable damage that Labour has done to their country.</p>

<p>You mentioned everyone&rsquo;s favorite equality commissar, Trevor Phillips.  I read in the Mail that he&rsquo;s being asked to justify his ¬£112,000 a year salary, as he&rsquo;s about the highest paid government official outside the PM.  So far, he has not given a defense, but I imagine it&rsquo;ll be something along the lines of (1) I&rsquo;m black, and (2) Britain really really really really believes in diversity it all its heart, (3) Your very demand of me is racist.</p>

		<p>One wonders how future historians will view all this.  We look back at the mass migrations which led to the Fall of Rome and wonder how it all happened. Here we see it unfolding before our eyes. Yet there were at least the occasional Roman who was willing to take to the field and fight the invaders (Aetius, Stilicho). Today, the Western world is paralyzed in the face of the Multicult. </p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;m surprised that the perpetual appeal to Hitlerism by multiracials isn&rsquo;t met by an appeal to Chamberlainism and appeasement by indigenous patriots to anti-white sellouts?&#8221;</p>

Is this supposed to be a statement, or are you asking a question?  And what on earth are you trying to say?</p>

Your question assumes that there will be objective historians and scholars who are capable of analyzing it   &mdash;   instead of just beating their chests and gloating, &#8220;We won!&#8221; </p>
<p>At the rate things are going, it seems highly doubtful that there will be any future Gibbons or Spenglers to study and write about it. Can you picture an Idi Amin (or a Farakhan or Sharpton)writing an objective history of the black takeover, one that does anything other than glorify himself and his people?  </p>
<p>And remember too, if Britain/Europe goes Islamic, that in Islam everything prior to Islam is considered a part of the primitive past that is unworthy of study or any sort of scholarly interest. To Moslems, civilisation begins with the arrival of Islam.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Orient will show some intensive interest in studying our experience. For them, our lemming-like demise will provide a chastening example of what lunacies to avoid.</p>
