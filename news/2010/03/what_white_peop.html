			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Jensen, YES! Magazine, March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the struggle for racial justice, it&rsquo;s time to pay more attention to the fears of white people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what fears could white people have as white people?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Put bluntly: The United States abolished a formal apartheid system but remains a white-supremacist society. After more than a decade of writing and speaking about these issues, which has sparked lots of feedback from all political angles, here&rsquo;s what I have concluded about white folks and our fears.</p>
<p><b>Aren&rsquo;t We Special?</b></p>
<p>For conservative white people, the dominant fear is of someday living without the privilege that comes with whiteness. Polite conservatives defend the primacy of &#8220;Western civilization.&#8221; More reactionary whites are openly racist about the threat that non-white peoples pose to &#8220;our way of life.&#8221; Both versions defend the existing distribution of wealth and power, even though many of the working-class and poor whites who endorse such views have access to precious little wealth or power. Race is used by white elites today, just as it was in the nation&rsquo;s formative years, to drive a wedge between people who would otherwise come together to challenge those elites. Divide-and-conquer strategies, it seems, never go out of style.</p>
<p>{snip} But what of the fears of liberals? White liberals might reject the very idea that they are afraid, citing their support for diversity and multiculturalism. But my experience suggests that while white liberals reject assertions of white supremacy, many fear the loss of white centrality. They are willing to renounce the idea that white people are superior, as long as they are allowed to live comfortably in a world where white is the norm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What remains obscured is the distinctly uncivilized nature that Europeans and European Americans exhibited during their barbarous conquest of much of the world. The inherently fragile sense of white self-importance that emerges from that history is at the core of white fears  &mdash;  at some level, we all know that the truth of the depravity of white supremacy belies claims of white superiority.</p>
<p>In the institutions that adopt the liberal view, diversity is just fine (as long as whites remain in control) and multiculturalism can flourish (as long as white norms remain dominant). Institutions defined by the values and practices rooted in white Europe can open up to non-white people, as long as we white people remain comfortable. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Getting Uncomfortable</b></p>
<p>This analysis of the dynamics of mixed-race settings is hardly original. Non-white people have long recognized that white liberals are happy to engage with folks who aren&rsquo;t white as long as their white-centric worldview isn&rsquo;t threatened, and that white groups are happy to have non-white members as long as the power dynamics don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>I observe all this not from some arrogant high ground, but as someone stuck in the same dynamic, struggling to get out. I know that for all my writing and political work on racial justice, I still feel most comfortable in settings where my understanding of the world defines the interaction, no matter the racial composition of the group. Rather than pretend otherwise, I start with that reality and search for ways to move forward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As tricky as this Latina/Latino-white collaboration can be, we also recognize that a successful community center with progressive politics cannot leave out African Americans, the third largest racial group in Austin. That means not just casting around for some black people to add to the mix, but engaging in serious discussions with people from that part of the community to find out what kinds of collaborations are needed and possible. Austin is a white-dominated city, but that&rsquo;s no guarantee that black and Latina/Latino groups will automatically come together; such alliances have to be built as carefully as any other. For us white folks in the mix, our contribution is to use the resources we have to aid in that process  &mdash;  not trying to control it, but also not pretending to be detached.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I have a choice: I can be white  &mdash;  that is, I can refuse to challenge white supremacy or centrality  &mdash;  or I can be a human being. I can rest comfortably in the privileges that come with being white, or I can struggle to be fully human. But I can&rsquo;t do both. Though the work is difficult, the choice for those of us who are white should be easy<br>

		<p>Mr. Jensen, if you really think &#8220;those people&#8221; are your salvation to becoming a &#8220;human being&#8221;, then you are very free to live among them. For starters, move to an all black neighborhood and show us how enriched you are.</p>
<p>You may hate people like me, but we&rsquo;ll never rob, rape, murder, steal, nor leech from you.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t stand White Privilege, there are many places on Earth where it is not present. I hear Harare is a wonderful place to live.</p>

		<p>So we can be White <i>or</i> we can be human, eh?  And this is the sort of thing that passes unremarked in the amerikan governmedia.</p>
<p>I have a couple of suggestions: </p>
<p>I think that people can be black <i>or</i> human beings.</p>
<p>I think that people can be mestizo <i>or</i> human beings.</p>
<p>Do you think for one minute that either of <i>those</i> suggestions would pass the governmedia PC filters?</p>

<p>He has it backwards.  White elites do not use race as a wedge to &#8220;divide&#8221; the races, but as a spear to kill white racial consciousness.  &#8220;Togetherness,&#8221; or whatever you think is the proper term for the opposite of division, is what the white elites want.</p>

<p>Wrong Comrade Jensen, since you are a Red, the decision to be a &ldquo;human being&rdquo; is utterly lost to you. Moreover, your treason toward &ldquo;celebrating&rdquo; nonwhite grasping and guilt mongering, leaves you a poor joke without a cogent punch line as a white &ldquo;human being.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Or better put, Comrade Jensen what is the racial demographics of your neighborhood?</p>
<p>Is it even so progressive as to be of  &ldquo;white centrality&rdquo; or is it in the caves and gutters of &ldquo;white supremacy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You do know, that Cuba or Zimbabwe are open to your &ldquo;ingenuity&rdquo; and &ldquo;insights,&rdquo; from a dominant nonwhite majority and Marxist perspective.</p>
<p>So, logically, why don&rsquo;t you really prove yourself a &ldquo;human being,&rdquo; and reduce the white majority of the USA by one, yourself?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Well, there certainly is a lot of white hatred here. It is hard to imagine any non-white writing the things about their own race that Mr. Jensen writes about his. But while he writes that &#8220;I observe all this not from some arrogant high ground, but as someone stuck in the same dynamic, struggling to get out,&#8221; the author is strangely vague about just what exactly he fails to do to eliminate his own &#8220;white privilege.&#8221; Therefore, let me give the good Mr. Jensen a few suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Immediately move to a majority-black neighborhood, and urge all his white associates to do the same. In fact, the blacker, the better. I would suggest one in Gary, Indiana or Detroit, michigan, although there are a number of other good candidates. This will show his solidarity with the black race.</p>
<p>2. Move to the highest-crime black neighborhood he can find. After all, this high crime rate is merely due to the &#8220;demoralization&#8221; blacks feel due to &#8220;centuries of white oppression.&#8221; </p>
<p>3. Cast aside his racist attitudes that white women are somehow prettier or more desirable, and marry a black woman. If the black woman already has children, so much the better. Mr. Jensen should fully immerse himself in black culture. If he is already married, he should get a divorce.</p>
<p>4. Give up any job he currently has and live off the government dole. After all, any job he has was undoubtedly gained through the unfair benefits of &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>These things are all the natural ramifications of the things Mr. Jensen writes. If he fails to do any one of these things, I must conclude that even he doesn&rsquo;t really believe the things he wrote.</p>

		<p>from the article &#8220;I have a choice: I can be white &mdash; that is, I can refuse to challenge white supremacy or centrality &mdash; or I can be a human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think a few options were left out here like I can be white, a human being, honest about race and racial differences and an advocate against racial favoritism like affirmative action. </p>
<p>White supremacy just is, it is not something being cast upon minorities. When whites are in the minority we will still be on top as a group, there is no question about it. the behavioral differences of each group are what determine the pecking order so Robert Jensen may as well just get used to it.</p>

		<p>The only thing we have to be afraid of Comrade Jensen are traitorous white people like you.</p>
<p>I like being white, I&rsquo;m very proud to be white (except when people like you come to mind), and I think the history of whites is being grossly and maliciously attacked by other whites like you so you can feel good - for now.  You preach the speech but don&rsquo;t walk the talk.  What could you possibly have in common with the other whites you so smugly insult?  Not a darn thing.  Get out of your ivory castle (pun intended) and live with those you so ignorantly champion.  Why don&rsquo;t you make the same sacrifices you ask of us?</p>
<p>It will never happen!!!<br>

		<p>I thought that I was reading a brilliant insightful article that hit the nail on the head&hellip; until the locomotive went off the tracks. The tracks on the bridge over the canyon one thousand feet down.  The rest isn&rsquo;t pretty.  You say:</p>
<p>&#8220;What remains obscured is the distinctly uncivilized nature that Europeans and European Americans exhibited during their barbarous conquest of much of the world. The inherently fragile sense of white self-importance that emerges from that history is at the core of white fears &mdash; at some level, we all know that the truth of the depravity of white supremacy belies claims of white superiority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  Barbaric conquest compared to who?  Conquest of much of the world?  Nonsense! And this resulted in what?  Modernity?  Civilization?  You wouldn&rsquo;t even know about our BARBARIC HISTORY if we hadn&rsquo;t invented the book, the press and the university.  If we hadn&rsquo;t chosen to be honestly critical of ourselves as we sought to reconcile aspiration to reality.  After all, why do we know nothing of the non-whites&rsquo; barbarism and shame?  Because it didn&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Sir, the fragile sense of self-importance comes from living in a post modern, antiWestern world of Marxist progressives who are at war with the very foundations of Western civilization.  It comes from FORGETTING WHAT is the foundation of our heritage.  We live in a hostile world of non-whites who want nothing more than to us back to THE DARK AGES because they want REVENGE.</p>
<p>Whites are fragile because they&rsquo;ve started thinking, acting and behaving like non-whites and third worlders, in all their amoral, pagan, dog-eat-dog glory.  Because they&rsquo;ve chosen at the culmination of all things to adopt a suicidal philosophy that DOESN&rsquo;T WORK to replace a tradition that set the standard of excellence.</p>

		<p>White privilege is a misnomer&hellip;<br>
	<br>
The white population is under assault; whites are often singled out as easy targets&hellip; being attacked assaulted robbed even raped in disproportionate numbers; other races tend to look at whites as easy targets because under the guise of protecting racial minorities, laws, programs, and practices discriminate against whites.<br>
	<br>
	It&rsquo;s fine to criticize whites in whole or part, because the media and our elected officials&rsquo; vilify and castigate any white who dares speak for are race.<br>
	<br>
	Privilege is defined an advantage, right, or benefit that is not available to everyone, if whites were truly privileged, whites would feel safe walking through black neighborhood or safe while discussing racial issues in a honest way. <br>
	<br>
	White privilege is a dead term, used only by those people that have either been asleep for the last 50 years, or for those who choose not to see the reality of the situation. <br>

		<p>Robert Jensen apparently doesn&rsquo;t understand that white people wish to continue to exist as white people, because to admit that would be to admit that there are limits to what is negotiable.</p>
<p>He is not capable of understanding the most elementary fact, namely, that white people reject the idea of being mixed out of existence. He is also incapable of understanding the difference between white separatism and white supremacy.</p>
<p>He is blinded in his mind&rsquo;s eye by Marxism. Marxism is the sum total of all that he is capable of comprehending. The Marxist meme has complete control of his head.<br>

		<p>The incredible irony is that every trait of goodness, fairness and altruism, especially to other races, is a white trait.  And white supremacy institutionalizes those traits.</p>
<p>As white supremacy wanes, so do those things.  Life anywhere on the planet where there is no white supremacy, life is brutal, racist, corrupt, and&hellip;.short.  Certain of the oriental countries have mimiced us a bit (japan being the most extreme example)&hellip;.however, if you look at their past, this is a recent development and one has to wonder how long they would keep this up if white american influence waned.</p>
<p>Liberals are fools.  Their anti-white racism destroys the very ideals they care about.  Or perhaps that is what they want&hellip;.what they really want.</p>

		<p><i>White writer: Whites must choose &mdash; accept white supremacy or be human.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a false dichotomy.  Whites must choose - accept racial second class citizenship in their own homelands, or be human like everyone else and pursue their racial interests.</p>
<p>Whites are bribed and threatened into anti-humanism (racial self-abnegation, totally contrary to human nature).  Everyone else gets to be human and express their interests.  When we show any hint of expressing, much less pursuing, our natural racial interests, Team Anti-Human (limousine liberal whites and NAMs, inter alia) call us &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;.  What else can anyone expect from this pack of shameless liars and useful idiots?</p>

		<p>Was this writer brought to us courtesy of a time warp from 1975? His idea of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is hilariously dates.</p>
<p>That said, what he neglects to mention is that while whites were being &#8220;barbarians&#8221; and taking over everything, they invented the whole modern world, allowing everyone to live comfortably. If it weren&rsquo;t for white guys, he would not be being read on the Internet via computer terminals. Nor would he have had a printing press. Anyone ever tell him that?</p>

&#8220;Racial Inequality&#8221;<br>

&#8220;Racial competition for resources&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt our pioneer ancestors got much by way of &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;  But, lucky for us, in modern America opportunities abound.</p>
<p>As the heterogeneity of a society approaches 100%, the following approach saturation:</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re the idiots if we think liberals want to avoid any of these things; liberals crave a state of permanent emergency under which they can justify as large a government as possible.  There may be better carney acts to this end, but so far whites in America and, to a lesser extent, Europe, don&rsquo;t seem to be catching on too quickly.  Con men don&rsquo;t stop using a con that&rsquo;s working.</p>

		<p>Sheeesh! Where to start. Talk about a bunch of feel good liberal gobbledegook. Anyone here could pick apart practically every sentence in this diatribe. But I will comment on just one paragraph.</p>
<p>&#8221; I observe all this not from some arrogant high ground, but as someone stuck in the same dynamic, struggling to get out.

<p><br>
If you really believe this Mr Jensen, then you probably are pretending. My guess is you are surrounded by like thinking White liberals, who THINK they would feel just as comfortable around a group of non Whites. Go spend a day in the hood and really feel the love of your non White brothers and then come back and tell us how the racial makeup of your group is irrelevant and how unfair it is to be in possession of your &#8220;whiteness&#8221;. I would suggest southcentral LA, East St Louis, Detroit or Over The Rhine (Cincinnati). See if that doesnt start you owards the path moving forward.  <br>

How come it is only Europeans who must relinquish their claim to a nation, as if it&rsquo;s based on some moral imperative?  The writer is a fool who doesn&rsquo;t recognize that the other peoples of the world aren&rsquo;t giving away their nations to strangers, nor should they be judged for not doing so.

		<p>Never more than 2-3% of the white population of Western Europe was ever involved in the colonization process.  </p>
<p>In the era of black slavery in the New World, an institution that was started by the Portuguese and Spanish I might add, no more than 600,000 slaves out of 15 million were brought to the U.S. (aka thirteen colonies).  Thomas Jefferson banned importing any more to the U.S. as early as 1803.</p>
<p>In the American south, less than 5% of the white males ever owned any slaves.  </p>
<p>Black slavery was never practiced in Europe at all. The majority of European immigrants to this country came after slavery was abolished and thus have never had any connection to slavery - especially the Irish, Italians and Eastern europeans.</p>
<p>Do you see where this is going?  For the last 1,000 years, never more than 5% of any whites ever did anything bad to any non-whites.  So how are whites guilty in the way the self-haters propose?  Why is it that non-white populations have always outnumbered white populations?  How many advances have whites brought that uplifted and enabled the growth of non-white peoples to unheard of levels?  I could go on, but you get the point.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve come across this guy before here at AmRen. He is a professor who specializes in whiteness studies. I don&rsquo;t see where this academic field is going, it just seems to drone on and on without discovering anything new. Where is the science here? Where is the debate? Along with cultural studies, sociology, social work, and anthropology, I think a case is made that these departments need to be put under political control. Clearly they cannot be taken as self-regulating science-based academic fields. The deans and department chairs should be appointed by whatever political party is in control of the government. The curricula should be under the responsibility of a cabinet politician and subject to debate in parliament and accountability at election time.</p>
<p>At bottom, whiteness theory along with all the other leftist tendencies eat themselves alive. There is the citizen and the government, and every other intermediate form of social organization gets deconstructed into oblivion. Marriage, family, private property, religion, standards of excellence, political parties, social class, nationality, ethnicity, &hellip; all get wiped out. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Race is used by white elites today, just as it was in the nation&rsquo;s formative years, to drive a wedge between people who would otherwise come together to challenge those elites. Divide-and-conquer strategies, it seems, never go out of style&#8221;.</p>
<p>This may be true, but who is it in charge of the newspapers and nightly news services, and at nearly every learning institution in the country? Certainly not reactionaries. Quite the opposite. It is a lack of support, and sanity, from the real elites that drive whites in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if Mr. Jensen read a brief post online from a scared or angry white person, and then wrote this piece in contradiction. How about we hear from the reactionaries, or those who promote the white race, themselves?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s another article that shows the sneering contempt that &#8220;progressives&#8221; have for white people, even when those &#8220;progressives&#8221; are white themselves.  If Robert Jensen is white he is a very poor specimen of the race.  Vastly better white people discovered the principles of electromagnetism, chemistry, quantum mechanics, genetics and biochemistry, and the axiomatic method, and invented most of the technology based on those things.  (Including the internet and world wide web that he&rsquo;s using.)  So I suggest that Robert Jensen atone for his whiteness by moving to a hut in Africa and never coming back.  He won&rsquo;t be missed.<br>

		<p> What a pitiful, self-hating excuse for a European-American! So Mr. Jensen thinks we have to stop being &#8220;comfortable,&#8221; whatever that may be construed to mean, and, I suppose, just hand our country over to the non-Whites. And it is OUR country   &mdash;   we built it, we wrote the Constitution, millions of our ancestors came from Europe to do most of the populating of it. I&rsquo;m not saying that there weren&rsquo;t non-Whites involved in some of the developing of America   &mdash;   slaves in the South, Chinese building the Central Pacific Railroad, etc. But it was principally people who look like the vast majority of we who read and post on this blog.</p>
<p> And by the way, Mr. Jensen, why do you liberals who despise your own race always try to claim that there is a wealth gap between Whites and &#8220;people of color&#8221; without differentiating. For instance, people with East Asian roots, as a group, tend to be more financially well-off than the average White person. It&rsquo;s blacks, specifically, who remain stuck below the average in so many things. You liberals love to say that this is because of the &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221; and &#8220;White racism,&#8221; but we all know there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that. I&rsquo;ll keep my &#8220;White comfort&#8221; for just as long as I can, thank you; I&rsquo;ve earned it.</p>
<p> And one final thing, Mr. Jensen: I never yet saw a liberal who could write a piece and make his explanations as crystal clear as the conservative columnists routinely do. In that aspect, as well as most others, you seem to be a literacy-challenged typical liberal pundit.</p>

The irony being, he&rsquo;s simply collaborating in an effort to preserve and extend the very real privileges he himself enjoys above most other whites in the nation.

		<p>After reading Mr. Jensen&rsquo;s article, I envision a euphoria landscape of nice, feeling somewhat delusional; my conscience tells me to come back to reality.</p>
<p>In the liberal world, many are stuck with being self-hating, posturing in white guilt, tripping everywhere to be politically correct, and last but not least, just plain hopeless in their addiction to so-called do-goodish. The suggestion that I, as a white person of European descent, should simply let go, tear down, and totally wipe out any vestige of my individual and cultural identity by whatever means necessary in order to become human, and to achieve racial justice is absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>The essay is packed with generalities and stereotyping.</p>
<p>According to the author, I am a conservative, non-human, white supremacist, living in fear, clinging to a way of life ancestrally inherited and passed on to me. Alas! I should drop to my knees and repent of my evil ways of self-determination and lust for capitalism. According to his whimsical platitude of &ldquo;economic and racial justice for all,&rdquo; I should &ldquo;share the wealth,&rdquo; live in destitute with the predominately lazy and uneducated, and deny the republic &mdash; all in the name of solidarity and equal opportunity. Sorry, but I am neither a socialist nor communist. I have no intention of relinquishing any aspect of my freedom loving spirit buckled tightly to a system of high ideals and historical truths. Read between the lines of this ridiculous dissertation, and how it literally, emphatically implies, for the sake of equality, a mass self-destruction of individuality, or in other words: a self-inflicted genocide of person.</p>
<p>Dream on Mr. Jensen.	<br>

<p>&#8220;Do you see where this is going? For the last 1,000 years, never more than 5% of any whites ever did anything bad to any non-whites. So how are whites guilty in the way the self-haters propose? Why is it that non-white populations have always outnumbered white populations? How many advances have whites brought that uplifted and enabled the growth of non-white peoples to unheard of levels? I could go on, but you get the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of the above quote is astounding. Some WN&rsquo;s have no problem taking credit for the contribution of a few whites yet at the same time refuse to accept responsibity for the misdeeds of some others&hellip;</p>
<p>Truth is white nationalism in multiracial America is a lost cause short of erecting a geographic barrier to separate the races.  Different races have always mixed when they find themselves sharing the same living space (central asia, north africa, south america, etc). Sure, white nationalists do not miscenegate but can they rest assured that their children, grandchildren, great grandchildren will follow their example in a presently heterogenous nation like the US?

To show the courage of his convictions, Jensen really should live in the barrio/ghetto of East Austin.

The South&rsquo;s economy could hardly be said to have existed after the war was over. We need to continually challenge the false notion that America&rsquo;s wealth and power was in any way related to the fruits of black slavery. The next time someone tries telling you that America&rsquo;s power was primarily built on black slavery, look them in the eyes and ask them that if what they&rsquo;re saying is true, how was it possible that the South lost the war?</p>

<p>We have to accept the reality that white people are a sick race. In America, the most hated group of white people (by white people), are those who openly advocate for white racial interests. But blacks who fight for black interests are not hated. What does it say about white America, that Barack Obama can get elected President, but Pat Buchannan cannot get elected? What does it say about white America, that Jesse Jackson can win several states in primary races (as he did in 1988), but David Duke cannot?</p>
<p>Are whites worth fighting for? I think not. There are more worthy causes worth fighting for, such as saving the whales, the pandas, the bald eagles, the tigers, and the spotted owls. When you fight for those endangered animal species, you will not see representatives of those species attacking you for advocating their cause. Whites are a doomed race, and there is nothing that can be done to save them.<br>

We, as European Americans/Europeans/Caucasians/Aryans, should fear nothing.

When Nietzsche was writing his philosophy, our race represented one-third of the world population.  Two world wars (fought amongst our own) and several police actions have contributed to a drastic decline in our racial population.

We should not be ashamed of our ethnic group and culture, as Mr. Jensen suggests, but truly laud it on high.<br>

<p>WRONG!  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  </p>
<p>Compared to the humanist, progressive white culture of today, the whites of the church age were vastly superior, morally, culturally, spiritually and in every other way.</p>
<p>What remains obscured is that SOME Europeans were barbaric.  95 percent of Europeans just lived and worked and raised families and harmed no one.  The five percent who ruled over them and tried to expand their own self interests used WHATEVER MEANS WERE NECESSARY for both justifiable and unjustifiable reasons.  Some merely responded in kind to the level of barbarism their opponents used.  Some were evil and cruel.  And what remains obscured is that the vast majority of Europeans worked as good citizens of their land and of the world.  And they advanced knowledge, transmitted noble and good values that served as a beacon to the world and they minded their own business.</p>
<p>And much of the greed involved in the conquest of the New World involved intra-European rivalries between monarchs and nobles for their own ambitions, good, bad or otherwise.</p>
<p>Whites aren&rsquo;t unusual in this regard.  They just did conquest better than everyone else, just like they do everything else better.  And if the liberals don&rsquo;t believe that, then they&rsquo;ll find out soon enough what a non-white reality will be like.<br>

		<p>Our rhetoric must change to one of <b>ethnic cleansing</b> and <b>genocide</b>.<br>
As this is the FACT of what is happening to us.<br>
This is something that people can be made to realize and understand with the proper talking points and sloganeering.<br>
Something non-offensive that can be used at tea party gatherings and the upcoming amnesty protests.<br>
I am not creative enough to come up with such things but I am sure we have some &#8220;ad men&#8221; out there.<br>
The <b>ethnic cleansing</b> message is &#8216;supremacy&rsquo; and &#8216;hate&rsquo; neutral and it is at the core of our current plight.<br>
Being on the defensive against charges of racism is getting weary and has become counterproductive.<br>
We need a PSA that is on the offensive.<br>
This contorted concept of &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; has unfortunately been a powerful tool against us being able to formulate our identity as a unique peoples. We must use a <i>human rights</i> focus to fight our ongoing genocide. The message must be clear. The talking points reiterated over and over on all web sites and comment sections of net media.</p>

Like all red-dye-in-the-wool Marxists, Mr. Jensen sees everything as limited and finite based on political distribution.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m rich, you have to be poor. While I live in comfort, you have to live with want and discomfort. And so on.</p>
<p>These divisions are allegedly politically motivated and politically made to keep some down and elevate others.</p>
<p>What the Marxists will not admit to is that input equals output. Anyone can live in comfort and security if they work toward that end.</p>
<p>Black communities can be just as prosperous as white communities if the black people in black communities make the same decisions and efforts as whites do in theirs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before. The handbook of civilization has been written by Whites (and Asians). Anyone, anywhere is free to repeat what works in their own community or own nation. The problem is that they won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s the real problem.</p>

<p>The above quote is sooooooo true.  Africans simply refuse to help themselves.  In the documentary movie: Ghosts of Cité Soleil (rent it if you really want to see what Africans are like), the leaders of a Hatian community sit on plastic chairs fantasizing about becoming rap stars or the President of Haiti.  They talk about injustice and how once they become President, they will help the poeple.  Meanwhile, raw sewage flows on the ground surface at their feet.  </p>
<p>Carefully note the difference here:  Any white person would immediately pick up a shovel and dig a ditch or dig latrines.  These Hatians have nothing to do all day but sit around and complain, yet not a single one will lift a finger to improve even simple things like sewage flow.</p>
<p>You can see the same thing all over Africa, where the Africans go to the bathroom on the ground, everywhere.  Whites have been telling them for 300 years to dig latrines.  Whites go to Africa and build out-houses.  Yet, the Africans simply refuse to do it on their own.  That race simply cannot be helped.  They are what they are. </p>

<p>(Neither is conquest in general but folks like Jensen don&rsquo;t seem to know about non-Whites and their successful war ventures.)  </p>
<p>Some people still don&rsquo;t get it so I&rsquo;ll leave you a question to think over.</p>
<p>Q:  What is the difference between your words and your actions?</p>
<p>A:  The truth!</p>

<p>I always am struck by the irony of White-haters using computers to spread their anti-White, racist, hate-filled screeds  &mdash;  the computer, of course, having been created by Whites using White First World Technology.</p>
<p>I would like &#8216;Jensen&rsquo; to provide an example of White Privilege.</p>
<p>Is it White privilege to be locked out of careers and passed over for promotions in favor of un- or lesser qualified blacks?</p>
<p>Is it White privilege for our children to be locked out of colleges and universities while blacks with far lower qualifications are offered full scholarships to the same universities?</p>
<p>Is it White privilege for the government to bus violent inner-city blacks into our White children&rsquo;s schools?</p>
<p>Is it White privilege that numerous black-on- White murders are little noticed, not covered or the race (if the criminal is black) is not mentioned by the msm?  Yet strewn cotton balls, a scribbled noose on a wall, knots in a string merit angst-filled apologies and wall to wall coverage by the media for days on end because blacks might be offended. </p>
<p>Is it White privilege for Whites to have to walk on egg shells around blacks for fear of offending them, however inadvertently, as we know &#8216;offending blacks&rsquo; puts us at risk of losing our careers and pensions?  Yet blacks can freely and openly call us Whites the most vile names with impunity.</p>
<p>Is it White privilege for the government to force Fourth World, life-long Section 8 refugees from African nations into the safe, peaceful communities we have created for ourselves and our precious children? </p>
<p>Is it White privilege that the government doesn&rsquo;t allow Whites to form advocacy groups to promote for our people, unlike every other race/ethnic group in the United States, and when we even deign to try we are instantly called terrorists, Nazis or Klansmen?</p>
<p>Is it White privilege for the AG of the United States of America, a country created and founded by Whites, to aver to congress that Hate Crimes do not cover Whites even though we Whites are targeted by blacks for murder, rape, robbery and torture?</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;White privilege.&rsquo;  But there should be in a country founded by Whites, for Whites, for their posterity, in a civilization that is a reflection of White DNA.</p>
<p>This &#8216;Jensen&rsquo; may think he has some sort of &#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; but he is nothing but a useful idiot and in the NWO his masters are creating, he will be the first to go.</p>

<p>However, this is NOT a voluntary process. To put policies and propaganda in place that deliberately force races and ethnicities to interbreed (or kill each other, whichever), effectively assimilating the respective races into extinction is morally reprehensible.<br>
When it happens with Darfur, the Tibetans, the Uyghurs, the Bhutanese, the polar bear..you would agree that it is wrong but when it is happening to whites in all their homelands by governmental edict it is okay?<br>
It would appear #47 that you yourself are a racist of the worse kind in being in agreement and likely complicit in the extinction of only certain particular human populations.</p>

He was just prating  freshman Sociology and knows as much about &#8221; White Privilege&#8221; as I know about what makes up the atmosphere of Titan. I once worked on a paper for NASA about first contact. The model we followed was 1492. European barbarity had little to do with the greatest human catastrophe of all time. Microbes that hitched along on the boat massacred Meso and Trans Andean America.  Remember the isolation booth they kept NASA Moon men in, this was a result of NASA research to prevent a reverse 1492 here. NASA has a super Golden Rule that is supposed to be enforced at first contact.&#8221; Do unto others what they want you to do for them unless your efforts are directed at a group who are more than a standard deviation in technology below your own,in this case leave them alone and try not to interact with them in any way.&#8221;  We should follow this rule when dealing with West African-Americans.  Just 300 years ago these folks wee hunter gatherers and had been for the past 200,000 years.  African American pathology is the white man`s fault not because of evil but because of good intentions.<br>

		<p>What Robert Jensen is really saying here is that he sees how nature operates as offensive. ALL of nature operates under a system of dominance with those being able to dominate, doing the dominating. This underlying principle of evolution applies to our species like all others. Human groups have been testing one another since the birth of our species, both conquering and being conquered. This is an evolutionary tool and it&rsquo;s how nature operates. All this article is, is just Jensen&rsquo;s big bowl of sour grapes due to nature showing no concern at all for racial equality. White privilege does indeed exist and it&rsquo;s genetic, this is a simple fact. Robert Jensen is attempting to blame the genius for being a genius while excusing the dunce for being a dunce. He is an all too typical race denier because reality frustrates his personal desires for racial equality.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between whites really being superior and the idea of white supremacy. Even an unconscious feeling of &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;. What the author fails to point out is that it is mostly those on the left, with their constant paternalism and activism directed at only people of color that instills this idea at an unconscious level. Then they get a little help from our friends overseas and Nigerian &#8216;e-mail scams&rsquo;. The majority of what we see and hear comes from our radio, newspapers, TV, and school teachers. You&rsquo;d have to be pretty isolated to avoid it. If there is some kind of white supremacy idea believed by a majority of people, I think this idea is one thing that keeps whites so silent and partially complacent as their societies are being taken from them or at least altered. It&rsquo;s probably not the only thing that keeps them so silent, but it allows them to bypass realty in a sense and prevents them from being too disturbed by it.</p>
<p>There was a book out once saying the same thing about black women. That with all the (black male) activists on the news, and with all the news coverage calling for help for black men, this kept black women thinking they were lucky. Something like that. At some point it even became easier for them to identify with being a black man than being a black woman? An identity denied them? At least with a positive association.</p>

		<p>Interesting conclusion by this rather silly man Jensen, that America remains a white supremacist society despite having legislated equal opportunity for all.</p>
<p>Well, on balance smarter people always end up doing better than the less intelligent.  And there&rsquo;s simply no questionm, however hysterically all the evidence is denied, that, on average, whites are much smarter than black Africans and somewhat smarter than mestizos.  They&rsquo;re also not quite as intelligent as Chinese or Japanese on average.  </p>
<p>But the largest and most intractable intellectual gap is between black Africans and all other major races, which clearly explains black African failure in every environment in which they&rsquo;re found, from the incredibly rich environment of Africa itself, to the Americas, and the Caribbean. There is simply no record of black African political, philosophical, scientific, technological, social, or artistic (outside the realm of primitive music) achievement anywhere on earth.  Of course, I speak of black Africans as a group; there are a few individual exceptions, but relatively speaking they are few indeed. </p>
<p>This is not to say that blacks cannot participate productively in the modern world.  There are plenty of necessary occupations in which people of lesser intelligence, be they white, black, or any other race, can compete successfully and live productive and orderly lives. But to force on them they expectation that they, collectively, can and should be anything they put their minds to is a cruel hoax and a sure formula for social disaster.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the point of even trying to engage with someone like this Robert Jensen fellow?  He is the &#8220;flat-Earther&#8221; to the race realist movement: His is a view of pure ideology, divorced of all reason and empirical evidence.  He&rsquo;s not interested in an argument, except the type that involves name-calling and silly labels, like &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;bigot.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s no point in wasting any time even reading the drivel put out by people like him.

		<p>Oh wow&hellip; AmRen always has articles rife with material for sarcasm and parody, but this one is a treasure trove. Let&rsquo;s begin:</p>
<p><i>Polite conservatives defend the primacy of &ldquo;Western civilization.&rdquo; More reactionary whites are openly racist about the threat that non-white peoples pose to &ldquo;our way of life.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Note that nowhere in that sentence (or the rest of the column) does he claim that this threat is not real, just that we should be willing to embrace and submit to it. Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s gonna happen&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Both versions defend the existing distribution of wealth and power, even though many of the working-class and poor whites who endorse such views have access to precious little wealth or power.</i></p>
<p>Well then, that would seem to belie your point then, wouldn&rsquo;t it? If this horse load is true, then we must assume that working-class whites either:</p>
<p>A) Like the current &#8220;distribution,&#8221; in which the most useless among us- such as politicians, bureaucrats, and taxpayer funded academics like this dweeb- live lives far more luxurious and comfortable than ours, mostly off the confiscated fruits of our labor; or</p>
<p>B) Must have different reasons for wanting to protect &#8220;Western Civilization&#8221; and &#8220;our way of life.&#8221; Yeah, that might be it.</p>
<p><i>Race is used by white elites today, just as it was in the nation&rsquo;s formative years, to drive a wedge between people who would otherwise come together to challenge those elites. Divide-and-conquer strategies, it seems, never go out of style.</i></p>
<p>Nuts. He almost gets it sorta right here (purely coincidental, I&rsquo;m sure). But not quite. Yes, race is used by the white elite for its inherent &#8220;wedge&#8221; effect. But the operative word is <i><b>INHERENT</b></i>. It is the differences between the races and their distaste for one another that creates the wedge. White elites are just using that which is already sitting in front of them.</p>
<p>Further, they&rsquo;re not so much driving a wedge as they are wielding a bludgeon, which in this case is the minority population. It is only the whites that need to be controlled. Blacks and latinos will never pose any real threat to the &#8220;power elite&#8221; (I hate cutesy buzzwords like that). At worst, if not sufficiently pacified, they might become too unruly to be useful. But they are great tools for stifling and disrupting other whites who might, if left to their own devices, provide very real competition for those same elites. </p>
<p>As for D&C; tactics never going out of style: Of course not. They work.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m white, and I&rsquo;m special.&rdquo; Conservatives are more likely to say it openly, while liberals tend to offer platitudes about racial justice while avoiding the risks required to make good on anti-racist principles.</i></p>
<p>Which means they don&rsquo;t actually <i>want</i> to make good on those principles, usually for the same reasons as us oh-so-eeeevil <i><b>RACISTS!!!</b></i> who reject them outright.</p>
<p><i>What remains obscured is the distinctly uncivilized nature that Europeans and European Americans exhibited during their barbarous conquest of much of the world.</i></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s pretty much harped on ad nauseum. And while the harping takes place, what gets obscured is the distinctly uncivilized nature and barbarous behavior exhibited by Africans/Meztizos/Gypsies/Arabs/etc. in not only their home countries but in every area or city they come to populate anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;at some level, we all know that the truth of the depravity of white supremacy belies claims of white superiority.</i></p>
<p>Does it really? Seems to me the &#8220;truth of the depravity of white supremacy&#8221; consists mainly of whites kicking the holy stuffing out of every non-white people they&rsquo;ve ever encountered. Not saying it was necessarily the good and moral thing to do, but consistently winning wars and occupations would seem to be pretty clear evidence of superiority.</p>
<p><i>In the institutions that adopt the liberal view, diversity is just fine (as long as whites remain in control) and multiculturalism can flourish (as long as white norms remain dominant).</i></p>
<p>Again: Gee, I wonder why that is? Face it, you can talk all you want about the joys of diversity, but at the end of the day no one really wants to live in the kind of society that they know would come about if blacks and latinos were left to shape it. And I don&rsquo;t blame them. I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>Just another piece of verbal diarrhea, written by well insulated, lily white. Mr. Jensen, if you really want to get outside of your racial comfort zone, I could always take you on the North Avenue Challenge. Interested?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what makes Jensen assume that any white success must be because of a political culture of &#8220;white supremacy.&#8221;  If whites were allowed to just compete on equal terms without all the reverse discrimination and political and private organization dedicated to suppressing them this would simply be justice and a fair level field of play.  </p>
<p>I am not afraid of competing against anyone - if I am given an equal chance, but I rarely have been.</p>
<p>It is not the fault of whites.  If we were blue skinned with genetic radar capabilities we would be blamed for blue skinned privilege/supremacy because we still would have constructed the modern world, at least all that is useful in it.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Further - I predict, if the current political and social restrictions on whites were removed and all simply left to compete, whites would once again be in the top positions and running everything.  (I do not make differentiations for religious types).  Eventual white world dominance would repeat if the experiment were run again.</p>
<p>But this is not because of political white supremecy, it is because history proves it - as it is proving the reverse in the current historical epic since white racial deconstruction began in the West (WW2 Europe, US 1965).</p>
<p>Today, a number of &#8220;experiments&#8221; are taking place where whites once ruled or dominated.  Virtually everywhere, including the U.S. is worse off because of either direct non-white rule as in South America or Africa, or effected by anti-white policy and politics as in Europe and the English speaking nations.  In the U.S. even most of our recent white presidents have been politically anti-white since JFK and LBJ.  Even China and Japan would not be anywhere without the ability or gall to exploit Western weaknesses (as in getting away with huge trade deficits and freezing of currency, etc.)</p>
<p>I think history is beginning to show and will illustrate clearly in the near future, that the change of management in the world from Western to Eastern while the West is deconstructing itself with anti-white policies will result in a rise of world wide brutality on an unprecedented level (because of world population numbers and desperation) and perhaps even all out war with the danger of a nuclear outcome. </p>

<p>Show us some historical examples. </p>
<p>Different races living in the &#8220;same living space&#8221; more times than not have (naturally) segregated, i.e., balkanized, themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, ignorant I say also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at the mixed faces of Central Asians, South Americans, etc. What do you say to that?&#8221; </p>

<p>In spite of the 27/7/365 interracial propaganda virtually everywhere you look in the Western world, White folks OVERWHELMINGLY choose to date/marry and/or procreate with their own genotype.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll say this here and now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The definition (from Dictionaries, a white invention) of BEING HUMAN, is to BE WHITE.</p>
<p>End, finito, fin, das Ende.</p>
<p>I am hereby offering absolution to all who have at any time, felt the false guilt of being predestinatedly created Caucasian, by God&hellip; who created Adam [Which word, in the Hebrew, means, &#8216;fair, ruddy, able to blush&rsquo;], BTW.</p>
<p>It would seem Jensen&rsquo;s cavil (like Cain and Judas before him) is against YHWH God, who made White Men as they are, for a REASON. To rule, reign, and sovereignly, paternally, build the Kingdom on Earth, &#8216;&hellip;just as it is in Heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In that Christ&rsquo;s genetics come from Adam, and not some dusky savage in the Veldt, I wonder which army Jensen is serving, if he offers up this lying bilge? [John 8:44]</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about mestizos from Mexico. They constitute at least 60% of the country&rsquo;s demographics. And they&rsquo;re a product of mostly Spanish/Ameridian unions. Same in other parts of the Americas. Oh wait, I guess Spanish/Portugese people aren&rsquo;t really white then&hellip;</p>
<p>And in Russia, SOME ethnic Slavs even exhibit mongolid admixture. Sami people (nomads whose original appearance seemed non-white to me) in nordic countries today look no different from their majority white neighbors. Gypsies in Central/SE Europe have already acquired considerable European phenotype/genotype. </p>
<p>It is YOU, not me, who needs to prove YOUR claims. </p>
<p>(BTW I am NOT AT ALL against whites choosing whites. Actually I am ALL FOR IT if that&rsquo;s their preference. I am just showing you present and past examples of regions of the world where different groups have come together and eventually traded genes. Good ole USA, I am sure, is no exception.)</p>

<p>I think the concern is at the to the tenth power of speed of the mixing, due to unnatural phenomena like man made means for transporting themselves directly into central masses of genetic pools.  The mixes you mention occured over long periods of time.  Some have sped up because virtually no one is free of the push to mix.  That is also artificial.</p>
<p>When I lived in a state of the former Yugoslavia, I learned that until recently it was a great shame to marry outside of your own village.  As I am trained in the health sciences, I have ran across literature that has shown that the optimal genetic matches actually exist in 4-5 cousins.  This has to make sense since for eons of time, clans or tribes had to be made up of distant cousins who married distant cousins.  We would not have such exotic and disparate looks in caucasians for example, if not for the natural geographic isolation peculiar to Europe.  </p>
<p>We are leaping over tens of thousands of years of evolution and racial differentiation.  I can&rsquo;t imagine how going against something so naturally occuring could lead to anything equal, let alone better.<br>

		<p>I really need to have a barf-bag nearby whenever I read these articles.</p>
<p>Mr. Jensen, you are an unbelievable idiot. I am especially disgusted by the following excerpt from the article: &#8220;What remains obscured is the distinctly uncivilized nature that Europeans and European Americans exhibited during their barbarous conquest of much of the world.&#8221; Where to begin? The most &#8220;barbarous&#8221; empires were run by non-whites. The Mongol Empire of Kublai Khan, early Arabic Empires, Ottoman Empire, and WWII-era Japanese Empire all coem to mind. I honestly believe the ONLY truly barbarous white empire would have Hitler&rsquo;s Nazi Germany. Even then, the concentration camps were the only truly barbarous element of Nazi Germany. I&rsquo;m sure, however, that the author is referring to the Columbian- and Victorian- era European empires; France, Britain, etc. Obviously he doesn&rsquo;t know his history, as the great Victorian empires were humane and just, they set out to discover new lands, civilize and convert the natives, and improve the lot of the poor back home by becoming rich off of the natural resources. Everyone benefitted. The natives got civilization, Christianity, and modern technology, and we got resources, national pride, and the good feeling that comes form knowing that you are helping the world. Now, as for the Columbian empires, especially Spain, yeah they were bordering on barbaric. Though even there, the government and the people were actually quite opposed to the harsh treatment of the natives, it was the vicious conquistadors, as well as corrupt segments of the ruling class, who caused so much pain and grief for the Indian people. Coupled of course with diseases, which was nothing the Europeans purposefully caused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can anyone report how Austin is doing nowadays? Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its not really that bad in terms of racial makeup, poverty, or crime, even today. Especially in suburbs such as Georgetown. In terms of urban sprawl, however, I&rsquo;d say its getting worse every minute. Neighborhoods are popping up left and right in Austin, with no signs of slowing down.</p>
