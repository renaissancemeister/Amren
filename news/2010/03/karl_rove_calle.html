			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Montopoli, CBS News, March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Karl Rove, the former chief of staff to President George W. Bush, held a discussion Monday night in Beverly Hills, California to promote his new book, &#8220;Courage and Consequences.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>As CBS2 reports, one antiwar protester deemed Rove a &#8220;war criminal,&#8221; while the co-founder of the group Code Pink, Jodie Evans, showed up with a pair of handcuffs and announced that she was planning to make a citizen&rsquo;s arrest. {snip}</p>
<p>At one point, Rove was reportedly &#8220;shouted down and forced to leave the stage.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Rove, who appeared without security, countered that the behavior of the protesters was evidence of the &#8220;totalitarianism of the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t believe in first Amendment rights for anyone but themselves,&#8221; said Rove, calling one protester a &#8220;lunatic&#8221; and demanding that another &#8220;get the heck out of here.&#8221; Organizers tried to keep the protesters under control, but order was never fully restored at the event, which cost attendees $40.</p>
<p>Rove ultimately decided to skip the book signing portion of the program. {snip}<br>

		<p>What is this article doing on AmRen?  Karl Rove is a war criminal.  He promoted a war that has cost white taxpayers billions of dollars and cost thousands of white soldiers their lives just to win an election.  I&rsquo;m just confused as to what this article has to do with race realism.  Am I missing something?</p>

		<p>Karl Rove is most definitely a war criminal. As are W Bush and Dick Chenney. I would call him a war criminal right to his face also. Karl Rove is also actively involved in bringing about the race-replacement of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. He is a completetly loathsome creature.</p>

<p>Laughably, I do not care in the least, that a race traitor like Neo-Commissar Rove was attacked by the Pinkish and Confused, Comrade Jodie Evans. This is simply two fanatics of the anti-white and genocidal multiculturalists&rsquo; schools, playing footsy &ldquo;of destruction&rdquo; with each other. Does any one with half a brain, think otherwise?</p>
<p>Moreover, they are simply fighting over the rancid bits of a Utopian Sociopaths&rsquo; America, that both El Presidente Jorge and General Secretary Obastard have so wantonly laid waste to. These &ldquo;people,&rdquo; really do deserve each other; we unfortunately, do not deserve being &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; by them and their absurdly orchestrated &ldquo;feuds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I fail to see how this made the AmRen news page? Nevertheless, Karl Rove is as wicked as they come, in my opinion, and deserves to be shouted down. The blood of thousands upon thousands of young, poor and middle-class White men and women is on his hands!</p>

		<p>On the one hand, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve this treatment.  However, I&rsquo;m hardly a fan of his, and affectionately call him Karl Roverrated.  He&rsquo;s the one who pushed the &#8220;Hispanic Strategy&#8221; big time, which led to Bush 43 pushing for amnesty and affirmative action mortgages.  IMHO, George W. Bush won two national elections in spite of Karl Roverrated, not because of him.</p>

		<p> So Karl Rove appeared without security. That wasn&rsquo;t the smartest thing he ever did, was it? Of course, the organizers might have thought to have a couple of policemen standing by, just in case. But that never seems to happen when these Leftist crazies disrupt a conservative&rsquo;s program. They yell, heckle, disrupt the event and (usually) force it to be terminated, then go on their merry way, smug in their assurance that they have driven away another group of &#8220;fascist hatemongers&#8221;.</p>
<p> Know what? It would only take a couple of instances of people like this getting their heads knuckled, good and proper, by security guards, (and I&rsquo;m NOT talking fatal injuries or anything like that) to bring all these disruptions to a screeching halt. They keep doing it because they&rsquo;re getting away with it. Conservatives planning such events in the future should take heed, and take action.</p>

		<p>Is Karl Rove a war criminal?  Let&rsquo;s look at the evidence: On 9-11, a group of Saudis (i.e., people from Saudi Arabia) committed a terrorist act.  The person who planned this attack was also a Saudi, and was living in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>In response to 9-11, Rove pushed very hard to invade Iraq, a country that not only had nothing to do with 9-11, but did not threaten the USA in anyway.  Between the economic embargo before the war, the war, and the sectional killing after the war, maybe 1 million Iraqis died? Of course invading Iraq and these 1-million deaths are justified, because Saddam was being mean to his people.  We saved the Iraqis by leveling their country and killing 1 million of them?      <br>

		<p>I can see this being a viable AMREN piece, not as a defense of the GWB regime, I won&rsquo;t defend it. However there is a memetic virus being spread currently regarding the Tea Partiers (read Angry White Males) and how they are malevolent creatures who are dangerous and not respectable in their civil disobedience.</p>
<p>This incident (and better yet the shutting down of the AMREN conference) exemplifies how bullying the left can be. </p>

		<p> Mr. Rove may indeed be chastized for many things of which I don&rsquo;t approve, however a war criminal is certainly not one of them. The republican party is not the perfect party, but since we currently have only two choices-. The left wins nearly every time simply because of the divisions of those idealogues on the right with the current republican leadership. To start another party would at this time be pure folly. The only logical answer is to get informed, be an activist, and vote to change the status quo, in the party. No true left winger will vote republican when they have such a clear choice. We must tranform the republican party to give people a clear choice. Roll the dice, and see what happens. [Anonymous #1] can&rsquo;t we even tolerate diversity in topics?</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a Karl Rove fan.</p>
<p>However, this seems like yet another example of how free speech, open debate and free exchange of ideas in a public setting seems increasingly to be a privilege only accorded to leftists. And if you&rsquo;re not on the approved list of speakers repeating the same old list of approved ideas, then if they can shout you down (or prevent you from renting conference space at a hotel) then that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

		<p>Yes, Karl Rove is a war criminal as well as a pompous flabby doughboy and cowardly weasel. I don&rsquo;t have time to write an entire list of his treacheries and malfeasences, but those of you who are well informed are more than aware of them.</p>
<p>This guy has probably never fought a fight in his life, along with the likes of W., Cheney, Rumsfeld, Clinton, Gore, and all the other no account scoudrels who have made a profeesion of livibg off the public teat.</p>

		<p>Karl Rove and Iraq are suitable subjects for AmRen for the following reasons.  Whenever you have racial, ethnic, religious, language, or wealth DIVERSITY in a single nation, you have conflict.  Such diversity requires a very strong and ruthless dictator to enforce peace(especially in the 2nd and 3rd World).  Despite the potential religious and ethnic trouble bubbling under the surface in Iraq, Saddam was able to keep it more-or-less under control.  To do this, he had to be brutal.  The result was that most Iraqis were fed and healthy, there was low crime and moderate stability.  </p>
<p>So   &mdash;   the USA comes in and removes Saddam, unleashing a religious/racial/ethnic maelstrom, causing genocidal &amp; ethnic cleansing conflict.  Thousands of men were captured by the various sides and tortured with blow torches to their genitals and eyes, and drills through their knee caps and skulls.  The leftists, liberal idea that democracy will bring them all together, failed.  The Iraqis are not like us.  For them and for most of the Third World, a benevolent, but tough dictator is the best form of government.  Every one of those thousands of Iraqis were were tortured to death, and those millions of Iraqis who had to flee their homes because of &#8220;ethnic/religious cleansing&#8221; was caused by Karl Rove.   </p>

<p>We lost 4,000 brave USA soldiers in Iraq, bankrupted our nation, and made the world despise us.  Yet, Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.  Thanks Karl Rove   &mdash;   great idea!</p>

		<p>I am as deeply conservative as a century is long. Having said that, everyone here should realize that the Republican Party is not our friend by definition of the word. They are simply &#8220;the lesser of two evils&#8221; and they should not be enough for you or anyone with an ounce of self-respect.</p>
<p>About a decade ago, I finally grew tired of watching the RNC become a compromising group of enablers for illegal aliens, undesirables, miscreants, homosexuals, affirmative action, and multiculturalism. Realizing the truth, I began voting for people who favored responsible, heterosexual Whites.</p>
<p>The Republican Party had six years under Bush II   &mdash;   SIX YEARS!   &mdash;   of complete control of all three branches of the government and they failed to move the country in a truly conservative direction, just as I feared and suspected.</p>
<p>My friends, the Republicans are NOT our friends. Their objectives are completely incompatible with our own. They are the friends of Blacks, Browns, illegals, diversity, multiculturalism, and affirmative action. Come what may, I will NEVER vote for the lesser of two evils again.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in a lot of the posters here. Karl Rove may indeed be a war criminal. But that misses the point. The point is that he was shouted down and prevented from speaking. Surely we here at AMREN can appreciate what&rsquo;s wrong with that. If he&rsquo;s a war criminal, then protest to have him convicted of war crimes, but do not attempt to shut down the venue at which he attempts to speak. Surely AMRENers can appreciate the gravity of that? Why do so many posters seem to be missing the point here?</p>

		<p>If Rove is a war criminal, arrest and charge him, and try him.  But you can&rsquo;t.  He broke no laws.  Therefore, he ain&rsquo;t a war criminal just a very not nice jerk.  If we start cheering the leftists in what they do because we simply also don&rsquo;t like the one they happened to pick that day, we play INTO THEIR GAME and give them legitimacy.<br>
Yassir Arafat was allowed to speak, and was cheered by the leftists.  No conservative did what liberals and leftists do at such things when the speaker is simply a conservative, or has a point they don&rsquo;t like.  We should rebuke and not tolerate such shouting down and disruption for ANYBODY.  Like the last poster said:  a consistent policy of cracking heads will get them to behave rather quickly.   Anybody remember how the out of control campus riots shut down immediately after Kent State?  I&rsquo;m not advocating that, merely mentioning the result.  Liberals and leftists are bullies and cowards.  THEY will never risk their own blood for a cause.  </p>

		<p>In response to 9-11, Rove pushed very hard to invade Iraq, a country that not only had nothing to do with 9-11,</p>
<p>We invaded Iraq because the Saudis told us to. Keep in mind that shortly after the invasion, the embargo against the Iraqis selling their oil on the world marked would end and that would have put tremendous amounts of high grade crude on the market, a market that the Saudis would not control. The Saudis couldn&rsquo;t allow that so got their best government money could buy (it was ours) and had it do their bidding along with the Kuwaitis pulling some strings too and both are still pulling our strings.<br>
The engineers told me that one full day of oil production of extant Iraq oil fields is equal to nearly a full year of Kuwait production so you can see how that would have affected the Saudi control of the market, and hence, our country,,,,,can&rsquo;t have that</p>

		<p>Given that the unnecessary Iraq war led to the deaths of 5,000 US soldiers and cost over a trillion $ I&rsquo;m not at all upset to see Rove being insulted by Code Pink pinkos.</p>
<p>Rapping Rove also pushed subprime mortgages for blacks and Latinos as part of his failed Hispandering strategy.<br>

		<p>This readiness, even eagerness, among so many Amren posters to so aggressively attack a white figure is disturbing.  (Unless those comments all coming from one guy, a dedicated supporter of the Black Party?) </p>
<p>Hate Rove if you like, but what are your priorities?  This is one more exercise in depriving a white man of his most fundamental rights.  Not only that, but an attack on a figure perceived to be representative of many white men.  You may consider him a &#8220;race traitor&#8221;,  but for those typically hostile to whites,  this type of thing represents nothing more than another anti-white action as they gather momentum in their war on whites.  Support for this kind of thing is not good for whites.  </p>
<p>While both the &#8220;left&#8221; and the &#8220;right&#8221; have proven worse than useless in the struggle   against the total genocide of white people, it is dangerously short-sighted to applaud the hostile actions of the virulently anti-white mob.</p>
<p>PLEASE do not be eager to attack fellow whites!  Remember how the white race spent the first half of the 20th century plunging into fratricidal conflict (&#8220;suicidal&#8221;, really) that has left us the aging, dwindling remnant that we are today, all because we are so ready to demonize fellow whites, brainwashed and trained to go on the attack when we hear &#8220;Left!&#8221; or &#8220;Right!&#8221;, just as we did then.  </p>
<p>Those who are shouting: &#8220;Left! Right! Left! Right!&#8221; are marching us at ourselves, and into oblivion.  Do not follow those orders like hypnotized zombies, already dead to the world and mindlessly consuming your own kind!  </p>
<p>At this very late and perilous hour, there is one issue and one issue only : the survival of the white race.  Failure in that makes everything else pointless. </p>
<p>We must not applaud any attacks on whites, and certainly must not join them!  If our people are to continue to exist, if our children are to have a chance, we must awaken our kin who are still under the hypnotic spell of the enemy, not treat our kin AS the enemy.  <br>

		<p>The pertinence for AR readers of this story is not the past policies of pro-war, pro-illegal-immigration Rove, but the shutting down of his right to free speech by leftists. The item is posted here because of our experience of the recently cancelled AR conference.   </p>

		<p>Karl Rove is a self-serving egotist who reminds me of that other egotist, Rahm Emanuel.Did Rove NOT tell Tom Tancredo to never darken the steps of the White House due to Tom&rsquo;s stance on immigration? He domonizes anyone who wants to save this country from Hispanic and 3rd world immigration. NEVER AGAIN, Karl Rove!</p>

<p>Your stance (&#8220;do not be eager to attack a fellow white&#8221;) sounds dreadfully like that black attitude we all despise: stand up for the color; to hell with the behavior. That is absolutely backwards. Our beliefs in doing RIGHT are exactly what separates us from them. If a &#8216;fellow white&rsquo; is doing something despicable, he is not my &#8216;fellow white&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s a traitor,a bad seed, and he needs to be corrected and/or punished. Bad whites (and there are plenty) are what gives ammunition to the other side, and bad whites are exactly what has led us to the path we&rsquo;re on. MY priorities are on justice, fairness, and treating people with the respect (or lack thereof) that they deserve. </p>

		<p>Those who condemn Rove and other white men of being war criminals do not understand the nature of their actions. These men are susceptible to the dilemma faced by a vast number of white people. They want to make the world a better place for all mankind. The problem is these men and too many white people do not appreciate the very real threat that colored people pose to Western Civilization. </p>

		<p>As post #5 points out, getting to watch as the Democrat liberals savage the Republican liberals is always great fun.  There is simply nothing in this fight for us.  If Republican liberals win, they will suppress us.  If Democrat liberals win, they will suppress us.  Pick your poison.  The one thing that will help us is for the economy to melt down.  Once trust and allegiance to this ghastly government is lost, we&rsquo;ll have something to work with.  Until that happens, the fat-dumb-happy voter will not change.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Kallias&#8221; You could not be more wrong! This was not an &#8220;attack on whites&#8221; as you suggest, but an attack&hellip;on a war criminal! I don&rsquo;t care that he happens to be white! Would I be concerned if some traitorous, white &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; were verbally assailed? I should think not. Rove is a louse up and down and is worthy of no support among our ranks - period. </p>
<p>Now, in the general sense I realize this article is about free speech and the political left, but on balance, this may be one<br>
particular skirmish we would be wise to simply remain above and away from.   </p>

I&rsquo;m disappointed in a lot of the posters here. Karl Rove may indeed be a war criminal. But that misses the point. The point is that he was shouted down and prevented from speaking. Surely we here at AMREN can appreciate what&rsquo;s wrong with that. If he&rsquo;s a war criminal, then protest to have him convicted of war crimes, but do not attempt to shut down the venue at which he attempts to speak. Surely AMRENers can appreciate the gravity of that? Why do so many posters seem to be missing the point here?</p>
<p>Ok, you make good points, but I thought AmRen was supposed to be a place to discuss issues relating to race and race-realism.  I come here expecting to read newlinks about immigration, racial trends, scientific studies, etc., not to see some article posted with the apparent purpose of invoking sympathy for a man who would sell out his race in a heartbeat in order to win an election.  Leftist are violent and don&rsquo;t tolerate free speech, we all know this.  Why make such an obvious point by posting an article making out someone like Rove to be a victim deserving of our sympathy?</p>

		<p>    I don&rsquo;t remember any Muslim nation sincerely condemning 9-11 or the Ft Hood massacre . I remember platitudes and excuses, even blaming the U.S. I remember Muslims the world over, including those in the U.S. dancing a jig in the streets and celebrating . I do remember Sadaam Hussein saying something like, &#8221; Then it was not us who pulled off 9-11 . We simply do not have the power to do so . But if we could have, we would have .&#8221; In my mind any Muslim nation not willing to hand over Osama Bin Laden is guilty as sin . That would include Iraq . All that aside, as an ultra conservative I was against both wars from the beginning . Not because they were  unwarranted or unjust, but because the taxpayer has to pay for it . And you run the risk of an economic meltdown as the Soviets found out in their own Afghani war . Plus, as far as I am concerned, the liberal democrats who penned and pushed through the &#8221; Immigration Bill of 1965,&#8221; are just as guilty of 9-11 and the Fort Hood massacre as the Muslims . And those leftwing fanatics some of us are now inadvertently lauding for shouting down Rove, support that bill a thousand percent . If the neo-con republicans are undesirable, the lib-dems are a plague and make Benedict Arnold look like a very honorable man (what am I saying ? Compared to the lib-dems, Arnold was a very honorable man) . Let&rsquo;s support freedom of speech regardless or we are like those we oppose .</p>

		<p>&#8216;&hellip;Karl Rove believes that one can administer &#8216;Freedom and Democracy&rsquo; from 30,000 ft from a stealth bomber. Remember War is Peace and Diversity is Strength&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anon:</p>
<p>To tweak a bit what you write:  Karl Rove believes one can administer &#8216;Freedom and Democracy&rsquo; while he and his loved ones are safely 9,000 distant nautical miles from the &#8216;action&rsquo; guarded and secure in one of the most highly protected places on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>What are the chances he and/or his loved ones will be exposed to numerous untested vaccinations, IEDs, poison gas, deadly chemicals, sniper rifles, or booby traps in the endless Middle Eastern Wars?  Yet he has NO problem seeing YOUR precious White child sent home in a body bag from the bloody, no-win meat grinder of the Middle East.</p>
<p>From James:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;This guy has probably never fought a fight in his life, along with the likes of W., Cheney, Rumsfeld, Clinton, Gore, and all the other no account scoundrels&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, while your precious children are being sent home in body bags, their children are safely sitting in seats at Harvard and Yale.</p>
<p>Anyone who is in favor of  sending your precious children into a bloody, no-win war should immediately be sent to the front lines and stationed there until the entire conflict is over.</p>
<p>Do not allow your precious White child to be used as a chess pawn, as cannon fodder for the likes of the war mongers in political power!  The same politicians consider his White life worthless.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fighting 9,000 miles away to &#8216;protect&rsquo; and &#8216;preserve&rsquo; a government that seeks his destruction, seeks to dispossess him of his homeland and civil rights and sanctions the eradication of his race?  He&rsquo;s fighting to protect a regime that allows hateful non-White illegal colonists to  march on the US capital with impunity, demand &#8216;the right&rsquo; that he financially support them, scream at him  to &#8216;get off their land&rsquo; or &#8216;go back to Europe&rsquo; and blatantly step on his flag?   This is what he is fighting to protect and preserve?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fighting for the &#8216;safety and security&rsquo; of a nation that keeps its southern border wide open so White-hating illegal colonists can march against and make demands of White Americans?</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;One antiwar protester deemed Rove a &#8216;war criminal&rsquo; while the co-founder.. announced that she was planning to make a citizen&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>At one point, Rove was reportedly &#8216;shouted down and forced to leave the stage.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is obama not expanding the war?  Are there not calls for 30,000 more young Americans to be sent into the hell-hole of Afghanistan?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Declaring &#8216;our security is at stake,&rsquo; President Barack Obama ordered an additional 30,000 U.S. troops into the long war in Afghanistan, nearly tripling the force he inherited &hellip;The buildup will begin almost immediately  &mdash;  and will cost $30 billion for the first year alone&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Would these protesters DARE shot down obama, try to arrest him, label him a &#8216;war criminal?&rsquo;  What do you think would happen to anyone that deigned to try the same tactics they employed against rove?</p>
<p>Where are the war protestors against the current far-leftist, war mongering regime?  OH that&rsquo;s right! Their heroes are in office now so sending your precious child into a no-win war is OK.  Why should the politicians worry, it &#8216;s not their children or loved ones that are fighting to &#8216;secure&rsquo; a nation with its southern border wide open.</p>

<p>&gt; Unlike non-white bigots, many whites still have some sense of morals and ethics and will not give anyone a pass just because they happen to have white skin.  Karl Rove is not a representative of &#8220;whites&#8221; - that is to say, he is not a white advocate in the sense that someone like Al Sharpton is for blacks.  </p>
<p>Karl Rove had more of a platform for his right to excercise his right to free speech than 99.999% percent of Americans could ever dream of.  And he didn&rsquo;t just speak, he put his ideas and words into action.  I happen to be a white man that is objective enough to perceive how much he negatively affected our political culture and how he abused his position for unethical and morally questionable actions.  </p>
<p>As I posted before, Rove brought political strategy and ethics to a new low.  This eventually opened the way for Barak Obama&rsquo;s election.</p>
