<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blonde teenager Anika Smit, (17) was found murdered at her Pretoria home on March 11, 2010  &mdash;  with her hands and forearms chopped off. </p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s limbs are missing  &mdash;  cut off just below the elbows  &mdash;  said South African police constable William Mahlaole. Nothing else was robbed. Body-parts have great value in South Africa: there is a flourishing trade in human body-parts for the lucrative &#8216;traditional medicine&rsquo; (muti) market in South Africa. People often are found mutilated  &mdash;  and usually body parts are cut off while the victims were still alive to &#8216;increase the power of the medicine&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The girl had stayed home from her Gerrit Maritz Afrikaans High School with an ear-infection that day and was feeling unwell, said her father Johan, 54. Her parents are divorced and she lived with her dad. </p>
<p>That morning he had still said goodbye to his only child before going to work and tried to phone her during the day  &mdash;  but received no response. When he returned from work at 4pm at their Theresa Park, Pretoria suburban home he saw overturned chairs in the living room and knew at once &#8216;something was wrong&rsquo;, he told journalists of the Afrikaans-language daily Beeld. &#8220;I called to her but she did not reply&rsquo;. Seconds later he discovered her lifeless body in her bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was lying on the floor without clothes on. Both her hands were cut off and missing. There also were six cuts in her neck police told me. The people (her murderers) must have taken the limbs along with them,&rsquo; he said. &#8220;Police examiners will still have to determine whether she was raped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the crime scene it appeared that she had either fought back or tried to run away, police said. The father had tried phoning her earlier in the day but received no reply  &mdash;  however he believed she probably wasn&rsquo;t feeling well enough to talk on the phone. He had also arranged for medicine to be delivered to the house  &mdash;  but around noon the pharmacy phoned him with the news that no-one had opened the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I phoned her around lunch-time but I thought she didn&rsquo;t reply because she didn&rsquo;t feel well,&rsquo; he said. The flag at her school was hanging at half-mast yesterday.</p>

		<p>This sort of crime, in a normal society, would cause such anger that massive revenge attacks would immediately ensue.  Having lived in Israel for a few years, I began to see the logic in collective punishment.  If blacks knew that such a crime would lead to untold carnage amongst their own, they would find ways to make sure it never happened.  Even as this girl&rsquo;s family and friends grieve.  Even as the souls of the children and grandchildren she will never have languish in darkness for eternity.  The &#8220;authorities&#8221; in South Africa probably won&rsquo;t even look up from their card games to consider filing a report, much less actually try to apprehend the culprits.</p>

		<p>Well #1, collective punishment doesn&rsquo;t seem to make the Palestinians any less pesky. Funny though, how the Jews are a most compassionate and liberal-leaning people by nature, but can hand any skidmark minorities&rsquo; hindquarters to them when they get organized and riled up enough. It&rsquo;s the way we white people are; it just hasn&rsquo;t reached critical mass yet in the U.S., Europe and South Africa but it&rsquo;s coming!</p>

		<p>This kind of thing is happening all over here in SA, and seldom makes the news in the MSM. Even adult white men are arrested for petty (or false) crimes and thrown in jail and gangraped by the blacks. We are powerles to fight back as our we are being disarmed, and the law is totally scewed against us. Even the last few remaining white cops won&rsquo;t help as they are understandably clinging to whatever job will ensure an income for their families. On the roads the blacks act with impunity and taunt white motorists - especially our women.</p>
<p>Rape stats are affected by the fact that very few white women (or their men) want to admit to having been raped by blacks - they live with the aftereffects and some commit suicide or lose their sanity.</p>
<p>We white South Africans are living a hell -and yet the outside world doesn&rsquo;t give a flier.</p>
<p>We have been threatened with war over the diverting of tax money into trust accounts - thus making it impossible for government officials to steal it. Yet when the blacks protest against the non-delivery of municipal services ( note that most of the municipalities have been banctrupted by dishonest black officials), and burn/destroy public and private property, they are calmed by further promises of services. </p>
<p>There is a lot of war talk going around, but the &#8216;government&rsquo; has a world cup to host and will hide the truth in any manner possible.</p>

		<p>JAY, your wordpresss blog was great.  I agree.  We need a national organization that unabashedly represents white interests.  A white organizatiion that would also hold our politicians accountable for policies adverse to us.  I am not a racist.  I don&rsquo;t hate anyone.  But the current trend is national suicide for whites.  Most whites can see it at this point, but many are afraid of being called a racist so they shy away from anything overtly representing white interests.  Amren does a good job showing the results of such maddness, but unfortunately so few read Amren that i get the feeling we are preaching to the choir.  </p>
<p>This story is so horrific; it is almost surreal.  It is so sad what is happening to whites in SA and Zimbabwe. It is hellish.</p>
<p>But your are right there is a lot of anxiety and frustration amongs whites, but it is also scattered.  It needs to be focused.   </p>

		<p>A top Cape Town hotel has suspended an employee after she refused to remove the white beads that indicate she is a sangoma in training. Zolelwa Mpofu, a linen keeper in the housekeeping department of the Radisson Blu hotel near the V&A; Waterfront, said she had gone on leave from the company on August 18 after feeling ill and deciding not to ignore the &#8220;calling of her ancestors&#8221;. When she went back to work nearly a month later, wearing the traditional &#8220;instimbi&#8221; or white beads, she was asked to remove them. The beads indicate she is in training and has obeyed the ancestors&rsquo; call.  &#8220;I told them I&rsquo;m not allowed to take these things off, I don&rsquo;t know what will happen to me if I do, I might get sick,&#8221; Mpofu said. The strands of little white beads are worn around the head, neck, wrists, arms and ankles. She said that in a meeting with the hotel&rsquo;s human resources department she had agreed to remove the beads from her head. The company then said the beads at her neck and ankles did not comply with the company dress code, and asked her to cover them by buttoning up her blouse and wearing long trousers. But this posed a problem for Mpofu. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not allowed to wear pants. This is part of my culture and my tradition. This is not for fun. I did not apply for it. It&rsquo;s my calling.&#8221;  Other alternatives the company suggested were to take unpaid leave while becoming a sangoma, or producing &#8220;relevant legislation relating to this issue to assist with a way forward&#8221;.  Because she continued to display most of the beads after the meeting, she was summoned to a disciplinary hearing, then given a written warning. She refused to sign it and continued to wear the beads. A disciplinary hearing last Friday resulted in a final written warning, and she was suspended on full pay until Monday. Another hearing will be conducted then.  Weekend Argus is in possession of the written warnings served on Mpofu. The offence is described as &#8220;failure to be obedient, respectful and to execute a reasonable instruction with regards to abiding by the company&rsquo;s uniform standard, ie to cover up your white beads on your neck and legs.&#8221;  Hotel&rsquo;s manager Chris Pike refused to comment, other than to say the matter was an &#8220;internal employee issue&#8221; which was &#8220;under review&#8221;.  A document, entitled &#8220;Company&rsquo;s case-aggrevating (sic)&#8221;, details the company&rsquo;s case made at the hearing, stating they are a &#8220;global, five-star international hotel group&#8221;.  It says Mpofu signed a contract with them in 2005 and was given a copy of the employee handbook &#8220;thereby accepting these terms and conditions of employment&#8221;.  The document listed the alternative courses of action suggested to Mpofu, which she rejected, other than to remove the beads on her head. The disciplinary action followed.  The document said there was &#8220;no SA legislation that supports or dictates to the employer on the policy relating to sangomas&#8221;.  A note on the company&rsquo;s case document states that &#8220;the defence also mentioned that when the beads are removed, she would be required to wear goat skins all over her body depending on what the ancestors tell her. Where do we draw the line in &#8216;accommodating&rsquo; and breaking the rules enshrined in our policies and procedures manuals?&#8221;  The constitution says no person may discriminate against another based on &#8220;race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social orientation, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth.&#8221; Department of Labour spokesman Page Boikanyo said Mpofu was advised to &#8220;report the case to the CCMA offices so that the alleged unfair dismissal can be investigated&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is apocalyptic. I know many of you say that we shouldn&rsquo;t rely on god or our religious beliefs, but hell, when the blue eyed Anglos (angels) started getting slaughtered and dismembered and no one bats an eye, surely you are incurring great wrath. </p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that things like this hardly disturb me anymore as they should, because every day is a story like this, but the constant media cover-up coinciding with the constant media deluge of pro-colored propaganda really takes a taxing on ones soul. </p>
<p>If not god, then I do hope that someone really does help us, someone that is much stronger than you or I and can save the entire West from itself.</p>

<p>No my friend, this is normal Africa.  I moved to South Africa in 1975 after having visited there as part of my job and was offered a very good position running large mining machinery workshop and even the blacks that we would all think would never think of such barbaric practices were being jailed or executed after due process of law for killing for magic reasons. Women were being burnt to death by their neighbours after being accused of being witches just as we had it 400 years ago.</p>
<p>This is why I get angry with those who have never studied Africa except through the propaganda of African &#8220;terrorists&#8221; now leaders in many countries who call me a racist for telling it like it was and still is.</p>
<p>I see that Zimbabwe again is shouting out about they are starving. This country once under white settlers, many whose families had lived there for 100 years) and they all lived well and with hope for the future but show an African with a bit of intellect a fat prize and he will do anything to steal it.</p>
<p>Many black people there would love the country to be colonised again by the Europeans as they remember the days of peace, (until Mugabe started his terrors), work and plenty.</p>

		<p>The pathetic condition the white race is subject to in things like this or the gangrape of white men by blacks in prisons of SA as reported by Commando in post 11 seem to say there never was a Caesar a Martel a Charlemane a Washington a stand at the Alamo a Sherman a Wellington a Patton..a white man worth his salt. Have we got in touch with our feminine sides enough? In my eyes, by allowing this to happen we are more guilty than the perps. We&rsquo;ve made ourselves food for the fodder of bottem feeders&hellip;but will we stop talking and stand up? Our greatest enemy is the enemy within our own race that have enabled this dynamic by blowing out of proportion the alleged historical guilt of the white race and promoting the worship of the perenial underdogs of the human family. These traitors must be Identified and kept track of* Also what were the crimes commited by the white minority rule before Apartheid was dismantled? How have the collective citizenry faired, both black and white.. under the respective governments? I&rsquo;ve got NO hatred for black people,.. these culprits.. {if black}.. were obviously demented&hellip;Nor do I advocate indescrinent vigilantiism. The highest Justice possible is always the most Noble road and is exactly what I advocate but I think we can see that some Spine will be required of us if we are to regain our Dignity. Lastly although feminists have certainly enabled things like this via perpetual propoganda for all &#8220;supposed&#8221; underdogs they seem inneffective and even unconcerned in preventing them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;People often are found mutilated &mdash; and usually body parts are cut off while the victims were still alive to &lsquo;increase the power of the medicine&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is no exaggeration.  The 6th of this month was the first anniversary of the death of old Mrs Lotter (77), and her mentally disabled daughter of 55.  They were accosted on their South African small-holding by two black youths who stripped them, lacerated their vaginas with shards of glass, and cut the breasts off one of them, probably the mother, while she was still alive. </p>
<p>Then the youths sat back to enjoy the spectacle while mother and daughter bled to death.</p>
<p>If you doubt this, do an internet search for &#8216;Mrs Lotter&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nothing new here.  Check out &#8220;The Nun&rsquo;s Story,&#8221; filmed in 1959, takes place between the world wars. One of the white missionary nuns in the Belgian Congo is slaughtered by a black native. Why? To stop him being haunted by his wife&rsquo;s ghost.  </p>
<p>That this might be an bizarre thing to do never seems to occur to anyone in the film.  It&rsquo;s just another delightful day among the black Africans &amp; their very enriching customs - and our heroine can&rsquo;t wait to return. </p>

<p>No doubt she was gang-raped before she was killed, also to &lsquo;increase the power of the medicine&rsquo;. In other words, the more brutal and inhuman the murder, the more &#8216;powerful the medicine.&rsquo; If they could get away with raping and torturing her for several days, no doubt the medicine would be still more powerful.

Have we got in touch with our feminine sides enough? In my eyes, by allowing this to happen we are more guilty than the perps. We&rsquo;ve made ourselves food for the fodder of bottem feeders&hellip;but will we stop talking and stand up? Our greatest enemy is the enemy within our own race that have enabled this dynamic by blowing out of proportion the alleged historical guilt of the white race and promoting the worship of the perenial underdogs of the human family.</p>
<p>The strange relationship between whites and blacks, has always been a source of great interest among Asians and Asian-Americans. It is characterized by both love and hate, and it leaves many Asians confused. There are many times in the past, when whites had the opportunity to solve the race problem the way India and Pakistan solved the Hindu/Muslim divide - the creation of separate countries. In the 1920s, Marcus Garvey established an organization of millions of blacks, that demanded that blacks be sent back to Africa. But the white American government jailed Marcus Garvey. Why did whites refuse to allow Garvey&rsquo;s wish, to send blacks back to Africa? Why didn&rsquo;t the American South demand that blacks be sent back to Africa, in the post-reconstruction governments that took power in the 1880s?</p>
<p>Blacks and whites are, physically, the most radically different among the human races. There may be some biological connection between blacks and whites that can only be explained by Freudian psychology. Many whites view blacks as little children, and seem to feel a need to be protective of them. And even the most white-hating blacks in America, find white women attractive. Why did whites choose to enslave blacks, and ONLY blacks, in the post 1400 slave trade (indentured servitude does not count)? Whites could also have enslaved other races, because many of these other regions (e.g. Asia, Latin America), were under white control. Why didn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Why are whites addicted to sports featuring black athletes? Why is black/white interracial porn so popular (Don&rsquo;t tell me that blacks are the only customers for such porn). The nature of relations between blacks and whites does not make much sense to humans outside those two racial groups. Any Freudian explanations?<br>

<p>Marcus Garvey was convicted and imprisoned for mail fraud, but a later President pardoned him based on flimsy evidence.  Voluntary repatriations weren&rsquo;t the issue per se in that matter.</p>
<p>Why no forced repatriation after the WBTS?  Whether or not there was or would have been a serious effort at that, and the reasons why there was ultimately none, is very much disputed.  I have a few, albeit unqualified, theories.</p>
<p>Why were only blacks enslaved?  Because they were easy to enslave, relatively docile if kept under control, and when they were compelled, they did their tasks very well. </p>
<p>The rest of your questions, I have nothing close to a credible theory to posit.  </p>

		<p>Muti occurs in South Africa as part of its culture. This, however, is not a muti murder. The dismemberment of white victims by blacks in South Africa is an expression of the rage blacks feel towards &#8216;white&rsquo;. The black national rage that flows through all westernized, civilized countries is just now coming to the awareness of whites in the United States. </p>
<p>Those of us who have studied black nationalism for years are not shocked by crimes such as this anymore than we were shocked by the election of Barack Obama, a devout black nationalist and black liberation theologist. Blacks have demonizing whites for years; this fact is the cornerstone of first three stages of genocide.</p>
<p>Black nationalists recognized that there was no way for them to defeat the &#8216;white devil&rsquo;s&rsquo; armies of governments; thus, they reasoned, the best way to destroy the white man was to destroy the white man&rsquo;s government, thereby disenfranche &#8216;white&rsquo; from its base of power. Black nationalists, including Obama, seek to bankrupt the government thereby rendering &#8216;white&rsquo; powerless to resist &#8216;Shaka Zulu&rsquo;* and *UHURU(*The mass slaughter of whites by blacks with the destruction of white culture.) </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s book, The Audacity of Hope, is a finely tuned mesh of black nationalist dogma that stresses the need for &#8216;white&rsquo; to appease &#8216;black&rsquo; or pay dire consequences for failing to do so. His vision of &#8216;hope&rsquo; for the &#8216;oppressed masses&rsquo; is a vision of destruction of &#8216;all things white&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the white psyche has been reduced to mush when it comes to frank, open discussions on race; this behavior allows an enhancement of black irresponsibility and the continued destruction of western culture. Why else do we hear accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; or &#8216;racist&rsquo; whenever facts are presented that reveal the white-destructive nature of &#8216;black&rsquo;? </p>
<p>The problem is not &#8216;black&rsquo;: The problem is whites who refuse to see the truth and when they do their racial acculturation and indoctrination causes them to recoil as though they have just touched a hot flame. Blacks will not hold themselves accountable, and as western culture becomes increasingly incapable of defending itself against the destructive forces of black nationalism, we will see more and more of these rage induced crimes. </p>
<p>When a black man slaughters a white person he believes he has done nothing more than squash a bug.  We are runnning out of time and time is all we have to resist Obama&rsquo;s rush to reduce &#8216;white&rsquo; to powerless insects. </p>

		<p>The tone here is much too defeatist. Remember what our ancestors did! How they conquered the world, how all fell before them. It wasn&rsquo;t just technology, it was culture and character, and these things will tell again, not just in South Africa, but in the United States and Brazil, and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>The girl&rsquo;s limbs are missing &mdash; cut off just below the elbows &mdash; said South African police constable William Mahlaole. Nothing else was robbed&hellip;&hellip;.Quote.</p>
<p><br>
As horrible as it is I&rsquo;m not 100% sure this is some sort of &#8220;shamnistic killing&#8221;, since the article says nothing was stolen you mean some poor uneducated creeps would&rsquo;nt stick around for a few more mins for some cheap tv&rsquo;s etc?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible this is a &#8220;copycat&#8221; crime and the cutting off of this poor child&rsquo;s limbs was to cover up a possible rape and abduction? NEVER ever heard of a white child being killed like this even in ZIM or Kenya, Tanzania etc(These crimes ONLY began in the late 90&rsquo;s against African Albino&rsquo;s when the popularity of Nigerian movies took off, in these movies there are many visual references to voodoo type ceremomies)</p>

		<p>We have a &#8220;politician&#8221; here in SA called Julius Malema (Google him).  He is the ANC Youth League President (almost 30 years old - youth ???).  This guy stands at a University meeting, in front of thousands and sings &#8220;Kill the Boer&#8221; (Boer = farmer, Afikaner or white, take your pick.)<br>
Zuma says it is not hate speech, but an old struggle song.  This Malema is possibly the most dangerous thing to happen in SA.<br>
Re the murder, unfortunately it appears that it was someone known to her as she put the dogs away before the perp arrived. If so, it wouldnt be a muti murder. Also, if it was a muti murder, they would have cut out the genital, heart etc, not just the hands. Still very sad.  </p>

  Mr. Patel, I think you have to realize the extent of multicultural brainwashing that takes place today in our culture. Blacks are almost rarely allowed to be depicted as criminals or substandard deviants in our popular culture. They are always depicted as a helpless persecuted minority whose social pathologies are due to racism and the legacy of slavery.<br>
Whites are taught to have great sympathy for black suffering.  Many great American leaders like Jefferson, Monroe and Lincoln wanted blacks to be repatriated back to Africa but the blacks&rsquo; numbers and unfortunately, certain exploitative financial interests made this impractical. For the last forty years, our privileged elites have gone overboard to show blacks in the areas they do excel in &mdash; namely in sports and entertainment. These elites firmly believe, against all historical evidence, that the race problem can be solved by miscegenation. </p>

		<p>Despite the fact that South Africa has been filled with genocide against whites for some years now, this genocide is getting little attention on the world stage. If it was any racial or ethnic group that wasn&rsquo;t of European descent, there would be all sorts of protests over it, and the public outrage over it would certainly be an issue surrounding the upcoming soccer World Cup. Where are the human rights activists, the UN, and all those who keep on about fighting racism? </p>

<p>  I have to qualify this and say that many local newscasts can&rsquo;t help but depict the true nature of black crime. Of course, stories are usually kept local  &mdash;  as in the Knoxville racial killings.</p>

		<p>Also for #25 Deepak;</p>
<p>Whites were also enslaved, not just indentured.  Check your history.  Blacks did better in the hot, humid Southern US climate and so were preferred.  Many white convicts served as slaves all over the New World, including Australia.  The US state of Georgia was first a penal colony, like Devil&rsquo;s Island.  Then of course there is the white slaving by Muslim Arabs for hundreds of years, right up to the 20th century and still going on today.</p>

		<p>Yes,as a South African, I can confirm this type of thing happens on a daily basis. Although this probably was not a &#8220;muti&#8221; murder, murder and removal of body parts for &#8220;magic&#8221; rituals does happen fairly regularly. One can also see similar actions in &#8220;farm murders&#8221; where the white folk are badly tortured before being killed (even young children!!!) More often than not, NOTHING much is taken - it is purely genocidal thing and NOT theft.</p>
<p>And guess what? Nothing much is said in the press&hellip;.</p>
<p>I live in daily fear since we have a black &#8220;township&#8221; nearby and have no resources to move away. Already been multiple break-ins across the road (in full daylight!) . Luckily no-one was killed - yet.</p>
<p>Please remember us when allowing &#8220;them&#8221; in to your country.<br>

<p>The  Native  Americans  were  enslaved  for  more than  100  years  by  the  Spaniards  in  the territories  they  controlled.  It  was  Spanish  priest,  Bartolomo de  las  Casas  who  &mdash;  when  he  noted  the  mortality  rates among  the  indigenes  &mdash;  pleaded  with  the  Spanish and  Papal  authorities  to  replace  the  indigenes  with  Africans.</p>
<p>Note  too  that  South  Asians were  both  indentured  and  enslaved  in South  Africa after  the  British  and  Boer  settlements  were established.</p>
<p>The  sports  that whites love  to  watch  and  follow are  just  those sports that  blacks/Africans excel in  &mdash;  and  outperform  other  groups  on  a  percapita  basis: soccer(Europe and  Brazil), basketball and  athletics.</p>
<p>Did  you  poll  those  blacks  whom  you  claim  &#8220;hate  whites&#8221;  to  know  what  their aesthetic  preferences are?</p>
