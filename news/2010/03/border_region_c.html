<p><big><b>Tancredo Calls for Napolitano to send National Guard to Border after Murder of Cochise County Rancher</b></big></p>
<p>Douglas, AZ  &mdash;  After the brutal murder this weekend of a rancher near the Arizona-Mexico border, former Congressman Tom Tancredo today called on Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to &#8220;reject politics and do the right thing  &mdash;  send the National Guard to the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tancredo was visiting the area when the murder occurred. He spoke Saturday afternoon at a Tea Party rally in Sonoita, Arizona, and met on Sunday with a group of local ranchers concerned about deteriorating conditions on the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Governor of Arizona, Napolitano deployed the National Guard to help the Border Patrol do its job. Yesterday&rsquo;s murder of rancher Rob Krentz on his own land 25 miles from the Mexican border makes it clear that that job remains unfinished,&#8221; said Tancredo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three days ago, Napolitano told an audience at Arizona State University that the border is more secure than ever,&#8221; said Tancredo. &#8220;I challenge her  &mdash;  no I dare her  &mdash;  to come to this community and try to sell that lie. The residents here know better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tancredo pointed out that Obama has halted the construction of new border fencing and halted the increase in Border Patrol manpower begun under Bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that Obama and Napolitano are talking openly of pushing a new amnesty program, the border invasion has resumed. Mexicans and residents in Guatemala and Honduras read those stories,&#8221; Tancredo said. &#8220;If Congress takes up an amnesty bill, the flood across the border will be unstoppable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Border Patrol spokesmen have confirmed that over the past three months, apprehensions on the Arizona border have jumped over 25% from the same period a year ago after a decline the previous year. The Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol has also confirmed that over 20% of all persons apprehended have prior criminal records in the U.S. The criminal backgrounds of individuals in their country of origin are unknown.</p>

								<h2><a href="http://www.diggersrealm.com/mt/archives/003355.html">Border Rancher Rob Krentz and Dog Found Shot to Death After Aiding Illegal Alien</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>"Digger," Digger&rsquo;s Realm, March 28, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The body of Rancher Rob Krentz and his dog were found shot to death on his ranch. Krentz, who always was good-natured and willing to help people, had called in that he had found an illegal alien at one of his watering holes and was assisting him. That was the last that was heard from him before his body was discovered.</p>
<p>{snip} Rob was at ground zero of the stampede that is destroying the fragile desert landscape.</p>
<p>The Krentz family has received numerous threats in the past by illegal aliens trespassing on their property. In 2002, the family was physically threatened when one of them stumbled upon a group of 39 illegal aliens. They were told to get off the land and they made threats. The Border Patrol did catch the illegal aliens after they were called, but we all know that illegal aliens, if deported, come right back across.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One time,&#8221; Rob said &#8220;You know, we&rsquo;ve personally been broke in once. And they took about $700 worth of stuff. And you know, if they come in and ask for water, I&rsquo;ll still give them water. I  &mdash;  you know, that&rsquo;s just my nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That means in that sector alone for one month, 8 years ago, the most conservative estimate is that 115,000 illegal aliens crossed the border in that one chunk of land in the Tucson sector. All of the illegals are unknown.</p>
<p>Tancredo notes that the Krentz&rsquo;s did mention to him that they called the Border Patrol. In one instance illegal aliens had butchered one of his calves.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re being over-run, and it&rsquo;s costing us lots and lots of money,&#8221; Krentz said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We figured it up over the last five years and it&rsquo;s cost us over $8 million,&#8221; Krentz said. &#8220;Cattle don&rsquo;t like people walking through, so they move. So, cattle weight loss, destruction of fences, breaking our pipelines, they break them in two and (the pipes) run for two or three days before we find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rob Krentz is just one of the many people who live and work along our southern border. A tough, hard working man who was trying to make a living and doing what he loved. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is not known yet whether Krentz was specifically targeted or whether it was just one of the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who come across our border every year who have actual criminal records, but in the end does it matter? A hard working man was killed on his own land. And all for just trying to help out someone in need.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I met Mr. Krentz man a few times and he really was a good man. He and his family have always been well respected people in the Douglas area.  Its a shame that this had to happen to such a good man. I also highly doubt that anything will be done to stem the tide of immigration into America, and it is unfortunate because this kind of evil will only get worse. Its becoming more clear every day that illegal immigration is forced upon Americans by their own government. I sure hope people wake up to this.</p>

		<p>If Tancredo REALLY wants to make a difference on this issue, he should show up where McCain is trying to trick conservatives into re-electing him and accuse McCain of aiding and abetting this murder with his support for amnesty.  Then he should endorse his tea party challenger and change the character of this issue to one of treasonous politicians on both the left and the right being responsible for the murder, rape, assault etc. of American citizens.  And a need to get rid of these politicians and replace them with ones that will militarize our borders.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;One time,&rdquo; Rob said &ldquo;You know, we&rsquo;ve personally been broke in once. And they took about $700 worth of stuff. And you know, if they come in and ask for water, I&rsquo;ll still give them water. I &mdash; you know, that&rsquo;s just my nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem.  If Krentz would&rsquo;ve shifted his nature to shooting trespassers(put up signs in spanish AND english, &#8216;Trespassers will be shot, survivors will be shot again&rsquo; usually works well) he would likely still be alive today.  Just blame any dead illegals on illegal on illegal violence.  How could anyone prove otherwise?</p>
<p>For any government official(or indeed, anyone at all) who would find this morally reprehensible I would like to point out that the government is refusing to enforce the border, resulting in damage to Mr.Krentz&rsquo; property.  He therefore would have had all the moral authority in the world to protect it himself, and the government has no right to complain - where were they when the illegals were damaging property?</p>

		<p>The media will report on a few rag tag religious fanatics who call themselves a militia, but are no threat to the population at large, yet they don&rsquo;t even mention anything about a rancher being killed, obviously by intruders from across the border, even as dangerous and as hot as the warfare on the border is getting nowadays. </p>
<p>Too, even the Moscow jihadist bombings were given lesser reporting status in spite of the fact the danger there affects everyone who uses the mass transit systems throughout this entire country.  If they can bomb Russian trains as tight as their security is, they can do even worse here any time they desire.  </p>
<p>Too, the next big catastrophe could well come from the exact same area where the rancher was murdered.  That&rsquo;s of less concern to the media however than a chance to demonize some zealots and paint them as part of the tea party movement, when they have no connection whatsoever.</p>
<p>The media&rsquo;s next big concentration?  Well, staking out the airports in order to make certain grandma and grandpa are taking off their shoes.<br>

		<p>For the future of whites in America, look to what has happened to the remaining whites of South Africa.</p>
<p>Just like in South Africa, it is getting to the point that white farmers and ranchers are not safe in some parts of the United States.</p>
<p>By not enforcing our border, our government has totally and completely screwed us, as always.  Of course, what we really need in this country is an immigration MORATORIUM for perhaps the next fifty years!  But with all of our happy-faced politicians that still believe that &#8220;Diversity is our Strength&#8221;, this will never happen.  I just hope that I die before things get too bad in this country.</p>

		<p>They already had this deployment, what they call it, of National Guard to the border. 10,000 troops were sent. But they do not tell you the real story. 10,000 troops were sent, but were sent over a period of eighteen months or so. So that means that on any given month, less than 1,000 were actually on border duty. And then also, &#8220;border duty&#8221; could consist of repairing Border Patrol vehicles at a repair facility 1,000 miles away from the border!!</p>
<p>Words, words, words. All intended to lull you to sleep.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;The body of Rancher Rob Krentz and his dog were found shot to death on his ranch&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>I heard this story on Roger Hedgecock&rsquo;s radio show tonight  &mdash;  I thought he was talking about something that had occurred years ago, not this past weekend.</p>
<p>Not one mention in the msm around here in S. California.  Yet one more White Native Born American slaughtered by a non-White  &mdash;  nothing to report!</p>
<p>Keeping the US southern border wide open next to a violent, Third World narco-state and not reporting non-White-on-White murders along the border are two of the tactics of the ongoing government-sponsored War on Whites.</p>
<p>The government, academia, and the msm have no interest in protecting White lives, and in fact encourage and champion our demise.  We are worthless and only good to produce tax dollars to fund obama&rsquo;s non-White socialist empire.</p>
<p>Remember the Merida Initiative?  Your hard earned tax dollars, instead of being used to build a wall to protect you from violent, illegal colonists, are being handed over to the corrupt government of mexico  &mdash;  1.5 BILLION dollars was shipped to the mexican government to help mexico control its borders, improve &#8216;The Rule Of Law&rsquo; (in mexico!),  curtail drug gangs and the demand for drugs.</p>
<p>Michelle Malkin reports:  </p>
<p>When the US wanted to attach &#8216;human rights&rsquo; codicils onto the initiative:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Calderon cried &#8216;racist!&rsquo; and demanded that the aid be forked over with no strings attached: &#8216;Give it to me. And give it to me without conditions,&rsquo; he told Congress&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Merida initiative worked so well that after three years mexico is even more violent and dangerous, the drug gangs more powerful; therefore the maobama administration has pledged another 310 million dollars in the 2011 federal budget.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the border fence is de-funded and the number of border control agents cut (as the agents are under constant threat of lawsuits for violating the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; of illegal colonists or being outgunned by mexican drug gangs armed with AK 47s, armor-piercing .50 caliber sniper rifles, machine guns, M4 Carbines with grenade launchers which Wikipedia reports were &#8216;probably stolen from US military bases.&rsquo;).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Thirteen Bell 412 EP helicopters, eight UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopters, four CASA CN-235 transport aircraft that the United States gave to mexico to fight its drug war are in the hands of mexican drug lords by now.</p>
<p>The US government allows its southern border to remain open, leaving American citizens vulnerable to violent colonists and foreign drug gangs while our soldiers protect the borders of Korea and Iraq.</p>
<p>Our military should be brought home immediately and deployed on the southern border  &mdash;  but you can bet it won&rsquo;t happen as it would interfere with the government&rsquo;s planned dispossession of Native Born American Whites.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>And to Bonne:</p>
<p>Je ne suis pas une femme fatale, seulement une femme réaliste.<br>
Tout le meilleur pour vous!</p>

 In reply to GetBackJack : Sir, many of us are feeling the same way. I myself, am moving to the Pacific North West ASAP.<br>
 I hope I&rsquo;m not breaking any rules but have you heard of this grassroots effort to find people to run for Congress out of our own States ? Instead of having to be &#8216;stuck&rsquo; with a choice between a Dems or Rep. It&rsquo;s called Get Out Of Our House.<br>

<p>Since &#8216;certain minorities&rsquo; would just as soon see a white person dead as look at him, being nice to them is simply taken as a sign of weakness on your part, or worse, an effort to placate them.<br>
I used to try to show good will towards them many years ago. No more. Now I simply pretend I dont see them - and keep a wary eye out at the same time.  <br>
We are the enemy to them, especially to those of this generation thats just come up (hip-hop nation). The hostility that emanates from these beasts is nearly unbelieveable.   </p>

		<p>Placing the National Guard along the US-Mexican border and finishing the wall that was being built there would be more effective measures against terrorism than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Besides the problems that are being caused by illegal aliens from Mexico, they have caught numerous illegal aliens from countries which are believed to be producing terrorists. Given the fact that it&rsquo;s very difficult to fly to the US these days, the best way for terrorists to get into the US is probably to fly to Mexico and then cross the border.  </p>

<p>Just as I was writing, Fox Newa discussed this. The Sheriff of that county said it was going to be tough to catch the murderer. If our government had enforced the laws, the rancher would still be alive and the sub-humans would be in their own countries.</p>

		<p>No other country would tolerate the brazen flouting of their immigration laws by illegals as we do. It&rsquo;s disgusting and has to stop. If Big Government can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s up to WE THE PEOPLE to take back our country&hellip;..<br>
BTW, it&rsquo;s interesting that when a group of white, American rebels associate in the woods to practice survival skills for the day when our goverment crumbles from within, the left-wing media jumps all over the case and law enforcement rushes in to quash them, but if a known jihadist group does the same thing in secret training camps all over the U.S., aside from a 60-Minutes expose, no alarm is raised&hellip;why aren&rsquo;t those camps raided and everyone arrested and deported? Half of them are probably here illegally in the first place and are plotting our death and destruction. Again, the double standard&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Where I work, 90% + of the people in and out of the office are latinos.  (Don&rsquo;t ask, I need the money.)  They honestly and probably appropriately behave as if it were a hispanic world.  Everything latino is promoted and loved.  </p>
<p>The only things from my culture that are acknowledged are </p>
<p>1) any holidays - an excuse for another party.  Latinos love to party all the time.</p>
<p>2) The need to learn English - but only because the blacks and Asians around here won&rsquo;t learn Spanish.</p>
<p>3)  Finally, clothing styles.  The Latinos love tight blue jeans, midriff shirts and baseball caps.</p>
<p>Other than that, I feel like an alien in my place of work.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time we charge Washington politicians as accessories before the fact for every crime committed by illegal aliens.  </p>
<p>The congress cares more about illegals than they do American citizens.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we make examples out of these communist traitors before they eventually attempt to make examples out of us&hellip;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fool yourself&hellip;there are at least 30 million illegals here by now, maybe 50 million.  I would love the census to count each and every one before even one is legalized by our traitorous congress.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure that has been stated in the comments here: The flood of 3rd world illegals will be amplified if/when amnesty is made law! Anything short of mass roundups and deportation spell doom for this country.<br>

&#8220;many of us are feeling the same way. I myself, am moving to the Pacific North West ASAP&#8221;<br>

I live in the eastern agricultural belt of Washington state. We  welcome white settlers, but don&rsquo;t come unless you&rsquo;re prepared to deal with more Hispanics than where you already are, most likely. We&rsquo;re overrun with them, most counties approaching, and some over, 50% Hispanic. If Obama continues with this shamnesty, I will look for someplace to live where there&rsquo;s LESS of them, be hard to find someplace with more, even Arizona.</p>

		<p>#29 Jay, you obviously live in California, or certainly a Southwest state. I could relate to your post here in California going back years. You are dead on right about how latinos act in California, and the reason obviously is, as I have pointed out dozens of times, it is for the most part, already in its essence Mexico. </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;No, I heard about Tea-Partiers hurling racial epithets at Black congressmen. Spitting on them, also. Seems that some powerful entities had all this deleted from all the video of the event&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The msm reported the word of the black congressmen without checking the numerous videos, without speaking to eyewitnesses, without any proof, and later, without retraction.</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt that the main goal of the specious msm is the destruction and dispossession of White Americans?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Thank God for Tancredo and the internet&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Roger Hedgecock as well.</p>
<p>He had several extremely angry callers on his show who were right next to the black congressmen and said they saw none of the behavior that they described  &mdash;  the &#8216;n&rsquo; word hurled at them, tea partiers spitting at them, angry White faces sneering at them and threatening death.</p>
<p>The government is cracking down on so-called &#8216;White Christian Militias&rsquo;, NOT black murderers of Whites, of course.</p>
<p>The tea party is next but I believe they&rsquo;ve already been infiltrated, confusion spread via a fifth column and that they are in the process of self-destructing. </p>

		<p>Once Hispanic illegals are made to fear for their lives more than they lust for our jobs, housing, etc. they will return to their own countries in mass.  </p>
<p>However, it will take physical action on our part to make this happen, because simply complaining about it and preaching to the choir solves nothing whatsoever&hellip;  </p>
