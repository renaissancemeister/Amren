<h1>&#8216;Drowning In Alzheimer&rsquo;s&rsquo;: Minorities Struggle With Dementia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Madison Park, CNN, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minorities such as Terrazas are at greater risk for the degenerative disease, according to an Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association report released Tuesday. It found that African-Americans are about two times more likely and Hispanics are about 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other forms of dementia.</p>
<p>The reasons why minorities are at higher risk are unclear but not believed to be genetic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Alzheimer&rsquo;s for minorities presents unique challenges. Socioeconomic disparities can prevent access to health care, early detection or proper management of other conditions linked to the disease such as high blood pressure or diabetes, said Angela Geiger, the chief strategy officer for the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans and Hispanics are less likely to know they have Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That has significant impact on the quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some families ignore the symptoms, such as behavioral changes and memory loss, because their culture respects the elderly so much that they try to conceal their flaws, said Dolores Gallagher-Thompson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Minorities may not get early treatment, when medications are more likely to be effective and when patients are more capable of making plans, according to the report. At doctor&rsquo;s offices, some can encounter language barriers and difficulties navigating a complicated health care system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority families often feel a filial obligation to take care of their elderly at home, said Gallagher-Thompson, who is also director of the Stanford Geriatric Education Center.</p>

		<p>Give us a break on the superior Latino cultural norms. As I recall, it was European churches who first built orphanages in Latin America because the wonderful Latinos abandoned them to live as beggars on the street. </p>

		<p><i>The reasons why minorities are at higher risk are unclear but not believed to be genetic.</i></p>
<p>And why are they not believed to be genetic? Because it wouldn&rsquo;t be politically correct to think so. After all, how could they blame Whitey and screw him for more &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; funding it it were genetic?</p>
<p>Then we get this gem:</p>
<p><i>Some families ignore the symptoms, such as behavioral changes and memory loss, because their culture respects the elderly so much </i></p>
<p>Not only does this imply that whites don&rsquo;t &#8220;respect their elderly,&#8221; but it absurdly assumes that somehow both blacks and hispanics, since they both share a higher alzheimer&rsquo;s rate, must also share the same &#8220;culture!&#8221; </p>
<p>And what about asians? I&rsquo;ll bet they have an even lower rate of alzheimer&rsquo;s than whites (Rushton&rsquo;s Rule of Three).  Does this mean that asians have an even lower respect for the elderly?</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to know they have Alzheimer&rsquo;s or dementia?  Now, the former has to be diagnosed as a specific disease, but dementia is a generic term, like &#8220;senile&#8221;.  Are so many of these people so low mentally that no one notices if they&rsquo;re acting even moreso?  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not up to date with the state of the art in the field, but in the old interesting Snowdon study, where scores of nuns&rsquo; brains were examined post-mortem, a correlation was found: those nuns who had superior academic standing, have written colourful vocabulary rich in their youths (&gt;&gt;&gt;suggest higher IQ, right?) seemed protected against Alzheimer even when reaching 100 years old and more.<br>
So this people, having low IQ to start with, precipitate into what to our standards appears as dementia very quickly and in great numbers. It is only normal.<br>
So absolutely genetic, contrary to the fallacious statements above. And white people have no responsibility whatsoever.</p>

		<p>DON&rsquo;T BELIEVE THIS SCAM!</p>
<p>This &#8220;news&#8221; article by CNN appears to be a scam.  I think it was made up to gain support for Obama&rsquo;s healthcare takeover from Black and Mexican voters.</p>
<p>It appeared on Google news on the same page as Obama&rsquo;s push for health-care deform.</p>

		<p>Speaking as a diabetic it is a well known fact that minorities tend to have higher rates of diabetes. American Indians, Latinos, Blacks, and some Asians have a genetic proclivity toward developing this cursed disease.  I have had Type II for over 15 years now and recent research indicates that diabetes can be a risk factor for developing dementia such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  It is not IQ differentials in this case but metabolic differences between non-whites and whites.  I am 1/32 Cherokee and the rest white.  One of the ancestors that brought me my Indian blood died &#8220;in a trance&#8221; at the turn of the last century.  I have often wondered if she was in diabetic shock back then and no one knew.</p>

		<p>I work in the health care industry and I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how frustrating it is dealing with immigrants who can&rsquo;t speak English and seem unwilling to learn, and I&rsquo;m talking about the ones who have been in this country for years.  I just don&rsquo;t understand why we continue to accommodate illegals to the extent we do now.  It would be like moving to China and expecting everyone else to speak English because I refuse to learn their language.</p>
<p>Secondly, alzheimer&rsquo;s is a progressive disease and no drug will change the outcome.  At best these drugs may only delay the progression but my personal opinion is these drugs are a joke.</p>
<p>Finally, alzheimers can indeed be genetic.  I had an aunt through marriage; she was one of five sisters, all of whom developed this disease at an early age (aunt included), as well as two of my aunts&rsquo; children.  One already died in her early fifties and the other who is right around fifty currently resides in a skilled nursing facility.  An ugly disease for which there is no cure.</p>
