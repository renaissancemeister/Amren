			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This month, the Census Bureau will remind Americans that racial classifications remain an integral part of the country&rsquo;s social and legal fabric while, at the same time, recognizing that racial lines are blurring for a growing number of people {snip}. The government will give the nation&rsquo;s more than 308 million people the opportunity to define their racial makeup as one race or more.</p>
<p>The agency expects the number of people who choose multiple races to be significantly higher than the 2000 Census, when the government first allowed more than one race choice. Responses to this year&rsquo;s survey will provide for the first time a glimpse at the evolution of racial identification: Those who were children in 2000 and were identified as one race by their parents may respond differently as adults today and select more than one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, growing ethnic and racial diversity fueled by record immigration and rates of interracial marriages have made the USA&rsquo;s demographics far more complex. By 2050, there will be no racial or ethnic majority as the share of non-Hispanic whites slips below 50%, according to Census projections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Census forms on the way</b></p>
<p>2010 Census forms will arrive in more than 135 million households by the middle of March. Two of the 10 questions on the form will prompt soul-searching for some multiracial people such as Harvey and routine responses from millions of other Americans.</p>
<p>Question No. 8 asks if anyone in the household is Hispanic, Latino or of Spanish origin. That&rsquo;s a question about ethnicity.</p>
<p>Question No. 9 asks the race of every person in the household  &mdash;  regardless of whether they&rsquo;re Hispanic. The instructions specify &#8220;Mark one or more boxes.&#8221; Choices include white, black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why does the government ask about race and ethnicity?</p>
<p>Federal agencies need the information to monitor compliance with anti-discrimination laws such as the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, fair employment practices and affirmative action mandates.</p>
<p>Only 2.3% of the population  &mdash;  about 7 million  &mdash;  identify themselves as being of more than one race, according to recent Census surveys. That figure has remained constant since 2000. But mixed-race marriages have jumped 20% since 2000 to 4.5 million, or 8% of the total.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jones agrees. &#8220;If the trends continue  &mdash;  rising number of interracial relationships and marriages, rising number of births (in) those relationships and increasing awareness of racial identity  &mdash;  we may see an increase&#8221; in people listing themselves as multiracial, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A biracial president</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census may never truly reflect the actual number of people in the USA who are of more than one race. That&rsquo;s because responses are based on how people view themselves, how they think they are perceived or how they choose to be represented in the national count.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Mixed marriages on the rise</b></p>
<p>Racial identity is increasingly muddled as the number of mixed-race unions grows:</p>
<p>o About three of 10 marriages involving Hispanics or Asians are now mixed-race, and almost one of six involving blacks are mixed race, according to an analysis by demographer Frey [William Frey, of the Brookings Institution].</p>
<p>o About 9% of marriages involving non-Hispanic whites are mixed.</p>
<p>o A 10th or more of all marriages in 13 states  &mdash;  most in the West  &mdash;  were mixed race in 2008.</p>
<p>o Thirty-six states had at least a 20% increase in mixed-race marriages since 2000, including Florida, Virginia and Texas. A fifth of marriages in California and New Mexico were mixed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census has a long-lasting effect on politics and money. Population counts every 10 years decide the number of seats every state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and determine how more than $400 billion a year in federal aid is allocated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Surveys suggest that younger generations are much less concerned with race than older Americans, Harrison says.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the younger part of our society, race is going to be less of a factor when they decide partners, whom they&rsquo;re going to church with, where they&rsquo;re going to live,&#8221; Frey says. &#8220;It won&rsquo;t be exactly color-blind but much more color-blind.&#8221;</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that USA Today can hardly wait until we&rsquo;re a North American imitation of Brazil. The writing style of this piece was typical of the mainstream media&rsquo;s take on race: Dark is good, White is bad, let&rsquo;s mix everybody up so much that we&rsquo;ll have no idea what anyone is racially.</p>
<p> At least at my age I probably won&rsquo;t live to see the worst of it. Then again, with the longevity genes on both sides of my family (English/German/Scots-Irish and just a little Cherokee) I just might. What a thing to have to look forward to in my advanced old age!</p>

		<p>Another article trying to create the impression that the small number of mixed race people are a brown tsunami who will make white people extinct. Of course, you get the delusional quotes from the fools who think everybody will be mixed in 50 years. </p>
<p>They included a graph that shows only 5% of children now aged 0-4 are mixed race. Whoop-de-do. Even the diverse non-white populations pretty much stick to their own. </p>

		<p>Why would a White married to a White Hispanic (a real one) be considered a mixed race marriage?  I think the census data doesn&rsquo;t give you a real picture of mixed race people or mixed race marriages because you can have situations where blacks marry mulattos and it&rsquo;s considered mixed race so the real picture of White racial survival is not that clear.</p>

		<p>Well, Wayne (#1), I have pretty much the same racial makeup as you do, with 1/16 Cherokee.  I too am in the older category - almost 65 to be exact - and it does seem that we&rsquo;re moving toward a tan society.  I just hope that the majority of people have a majority of white and Asian blood, so that the intelligence is kept high.  I don&rsquo;t really care about raising superior basketball players, but I do care about leaving the world knowing that our people in America are going to maintain a high intelligence or even improve on what we already have.</p>

<p>The South would have secured the border. Lincoln&rsquo;s illegal war against us and our people will bring down our republic through illegal immigration and Obamination.  In so doing, we can only hope that Northern states feel as much pain as we do.</p>

<p>That was my take too.</p>
<p>USA Today is giddy over the prospect of eliminating the &#8216;social construct&rsquo; of race by intermixing all the &#8216;social constructs&rsquo; based on a dream that it&rsquo;s for a greater good.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the insanity of the Vietnam War when they told us &#8216;we have to destroy the village in order to save it&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t believe the cultural left about anything else, so why let them alarm us about the state of ethnicity in 2050?  A polyglot is what they WANT, but may not at all be what will actually happen.  The U.S. might get tougher on immigration, so that we&rsquo;re not continually swamped by those south of the border.  Non-white Hispanics may become more Americanized and have less children.  Blacks, who&rsquo;ve been around 12% for years, may fall in the national percentage.  And, think about it  &mdash;  whites now make up the largest racial group in the nation.  If non-whites interbreed with whites, their children are likely to do the same, so that the darker races become subsumed into the majority  &mdash;  just like so many Native Americans have done.  It may not be ideal, but it beats white minority status.</p>

		<p>I have mentioned to my husband on so many occasions that I am deathly sick of seeing a large and ever-growing number of people now in this country that you can&rsquo;t even identify WHAT they are anymore. You can&rsquo;t tell if they&rsquo;re part black, if they&rsquo;re Mexican, Middle Eastern, Italian, Greek,etc., or any combination thereof. It&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting. And none of them claim being American without a hyphen in front. Their ancestral history is much more important to them than ever being just a American. This is what diversity has created. If diversity was beneficial, why do all military organizations drill &#8216;one way of doing every job, with no variation, no options, no individualism&rsquo;? Because diversity is detrimental to efficiency.</p>

<p>  Ah, yes, this is the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. It doesn&rsquo;t work and won&rsquo;t work here in either. Long before whites become a minority in America, America will no longer be America. </p>

<p>If he&rsquo;s &#8220;black&#8221;, then how can he also be &#8220;biracial&#8221;? They dare not use the &#8220;M&#8221; word (mulatto).</p>

		<p>The sad and sick part of the matter is that these numbers may actually be underestimating things. There are interracial marriages that do not involve Whites and the Census may not even count as interracial marriages. For example, a Chinese person who marries a Nepali person is a marriage that may not be counted as an interracial marriage because they are both Asian. Anyone who opens their eyes and watches enough television can see interracial marriages on the rise in America and throughout the West. You have to take an ethical stand against it to have any lasting effect. What we do here in complaining about changing demographics does not mean anything until people realize it is based on something deeper. We are losing the hearts and minds of people. You can just look at the USA Today comments and many other comments on such stories around the internet if you do not believe me.</p>

<p>I frankly don&rsquo;t care what other races are doing, only Whites.  Maybe your problem is you need to turn off the television?  There was a news story some months ago about Federal agents in the town of Jordan, MT.  Jordan is a town of about 350 people with one black person listed on the census as living there.  One of the TV stations did an interview with one of the townspeople and guess what?  It turned out to be that one black person in a sea of White people, a high yellow mulatto woman.  Gee, what are the odds on that happening?  People are being conditioned to believe things that are false and they&rsquo;re using all sorts of devilish trickery to accomplish it, including swamping online news articles and blogs with their own biased opinions.  That&rsquo;s why so many people don&rsquo;t read these rags anymore with their biased articles and phony comments.</p>
