<h1>Life for &#8216;Ghetto&rsquo; Rapists</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News24 (Cape Town), March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two of the three men who raped a pregnant woman due to their &#8220;ghetto life&#8221; received life sentences in the Eastern Cape High Court on Monday.</p>
<p>Kevin Campbell, 24, and Elvis Nelson, 25, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, and another five years for the robbery of a 37-year-old woman on February 15, 2009, Captain Mali Govender said.</p>
<p>A third man, Clayton Donovan Arends, 18, was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment for rape and another five years for robbery.</p>
<p>All the sentences would run concurrently.</p>
<p><b>Apologised</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The youngest of the trio apologised for what they had done to her, attributing their actions to the &#8216;ghetto life&rsquo; they led. He also mentioned to her that this was the only way that they could have gotten a &#8216;white bitch&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman was walking with a man in Port Alfred near the local SPCA when they were attacked by the three, one of whom was armed with a panga. The trio demanded drugs and money from the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was threatened by Elvis [Nelson] that he will be killed and that his arms will be cut off. Clayton Arends then first hit him with the blunt edge of the panga and after realising his mistake he hit him with the sharp edge,&#8221; said Govender.</p>
<p>The woman ran away and hid in the bush. Her male companion hit Arends in the face before escaping.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an attempt to get the suspects away from the female victim, he called out to them that he had a cellphone and R600 cash with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this the three found the woman and took turns raping her.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Lucky&rsquo; her life was spared</b></p>
<p>&#8220;She begged and pleaded for them to stop, but this was in vain. She was strangled on several occasions to stop her from making a noise and [drawing] attention. She also told them that she was pregnant and this also fell on deaf ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two older men left after they heard barking dogs and believed the police had arrived.</p>
<p>Arends told the woman he would lead her out of the bush. As soon as they reached a clearing, the woman ran away. She flagged down a passing police vehicle.</p>
<p>The three were identified and arrested soon after. They were convicted of the rape and robbery on December 11 last year.</p>
<p>In an interview before the sentencing, Campbell said he expected a life term. Nelson believed, because he had maintained his innocence, that he would be given a lighter sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They also mentioned that the victim was very &#8216;lucky&rsquo; as her life had been spared.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Govender, the 37-year-old woman told her: &#8220;I am glad that they all got high sentences. I am so relieved. What they got is what they deserve.&#8221;<br>

<p>Lovely &#8220;apology&#8221;.  A white woman is their highest goal though.  I&rsquo;m sure the main they &#8220;spared&#8221; her life was because they thought the cops were coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nelson believed, because he had maintained his innocence, that he would be given a lighter sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is typical of the black thought process.  &#8220;I said I&rsquo;m innocent, so they should just take my word, or they should give me a lighter sentence&hellip;&#8221;  They cannot grasp the complexities of things like trials.</p>

		<p>Is sad to say but Im really looking forward to the chaos come June when the World Cup and also the eyes of the world are on South Africa.  Im sure the reasons for any failure will be blamed on decades of Apartheid or racism.  That is if any problems even make it to the press.</p>

<p>Yes, and I can&rsquo;t wait, as I know that no racially aware Whites will be there TO BE victimized. We know better. They&rsquo;ll be assaulting those &#8220;good progressive White folks&#8221; just coming off their Haiti relief duties. The S.A. World Cup just might give us a few more Amren members. I&rsquo;m only worried that the media won&rsquo;t report it. Just like they don&rsquo;t report the CURRENT slaughter of Whites in S.A.. When I mention this to other Whites, they have no idea it&rsquo;s going on and look at me with a blank stare. It&rsquo;s like looking in the face of &#8220;The Body Snatchers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here is the headline of this story: </p>
<p><br>
<i>Life for &lsquo;Ghetto&rsquo; Rapists</i></p>
<p><br>
And here is the opening sentence   &mdash;   the &#8220;lede&#8221; which seeks to define a newspaper story as a whole   &mdash;   in this item.: </p>
<p><br>
<i>Two of the three men who raped a pregnant woman due to their &ldquo;ghetto life&rdquo; received life sentences in the Eastern Cape High Court on Monday.</i></p>
<p><br>
Then, a little later, buried within the body of the piece, we get this fuller explanation of this &#8220;ghetto&#8221; theme: </p>
<p><br>
<i>&ldquo;The youngest of the trio apologised for what they had done to her, attributing their actions to the &lsquo;ghetto life&rsquo; they led&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
Ah, so the rape&rsquo;s being &#8220;due to their ghetto life&#8221; turns out to be merely one person&rsquo;s opinion, rather than an objective reality; or any sort of &#8220;settled science&#8221; on the matter of sexual criminality. </p>
<p>And who is that one person who&rsquo;s opinion it is? <i>The rapist himself.<i> &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t rape dat white lady, da <i>ghetto</i> done did raped her!&#8221; </i></i></p>
<p>So here we have a Cape Town TV news station accepting and promoting as fact, a black rapist&rsquo;s opinion that blacks rape whites is understandable due to ghetto poverty   &mdash;   rather than any personal or group failures on the part of the black rapists. And since we all know that black ghetto poverty is, of course, the fault of whites, this article is tacitly <i>blaming whites for being raped by blacks</i>. </p>
<p>Hey, you know when African Americans talk about &#8220;getting more diverse voices in the mainstream media&#8221;? <i>This</i> is the kind of thing they mean. </p>

<p>Of course, just about every AR regular can knock that ball out of the park.  The ghetto is the way it is because of people like these three doing the things they do.  They make their bad environment, and will make a good environment bad if they move (or are moved) to another place.</p>

		<p>As to the World Cup comments. Do you really think that-<br>
A. Such news stories will be aired<br>
B. Those that do will not be laden with &#8220;responsible&#8221; journalists controlling the context.<br>
C. That the victim will not be blamed for being white.</p>
<p>The only way out is if some OTHER minority group is attacked(enmasse) and their government raises a stink. Much like the early stages of the Haiti earthquake relief it was Asian troops with bayonets and rifle butts pushing back the looters.</p>

		<p>Dear Americans,<br>
please do me a favor and buy weapons. Please do it. In our white countries the more whites are killed the more the imigration-lobby forbids weapons. You have a right of having weapon, use it.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure America will in a few decades openly get a racist country in which whites will build white-only cities, and you have to protect them. Buy whatever could be useful for defending you families. We Germans can&rsquo;t so you have to do.</p>

<p>Yes, I think the journalists will talk about it for three reasons:<br>
A. There will be so much blood that they will not be able to hide it.<br>
B. Not all white journalists are anti-white and some will maybe change their opinion, when they see what happened to Africa.<br>
C. We have the internet. If one Newspaper writes about it, it will get public.</p>

		<p>People had better face the facts: ghetto blacks, with their low IQ&rsquo;s and high testosterone, are just like wild animals.  When loose in society, they do what their instincts tell them without even thinking about it.  Silly liberals who allow them access to their cars and homes are as foolish as someone who would open a door to a Bengal tiger, but it happens everyday.  If the TV MSM reported all this activity, many people would be stunned to hear the truth.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t have the energy to care anymore what happens in any other country but mine. Our plate is full here, and despite the fact many will say what happens there affects what happens here, it doesn&rsquo;t need to. We allow it to, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. If we were to (big chuckle here) draw a [reasonable, sensible, survivalist] mode of thinking and force abominable behavior to stop at our borders.</p>

		<p> &#8220;&hellip; The S.A. World Cup just might give us a few more Amren members. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol, and exactly why do you think that would matter anyways? Do you really think Amren is going to have any discernible &#8216;impact&rsquo; on historical events with a &#8216;few more&rsquo; among the rank-and-file? </p>
<p>Of course, it won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>The fundamental reason is that Amreners are essentially conservative, and they have all of the faults and misimpressions which plague the conservative mode of being. </p>
<p>Most Amreners want to &#8216;reform&rsquo; the System, rather than do away with it entirely. I&rsquo;ve heard Mr. Taylor say on a number of occasions, that his mission would be completely satisfied if the anti-White laws against free association were abolished. This is precisely what will NOT work; at least, it will not work for the purpose of saving the White race. It may help to prolong the system a little longer, but prolonging the system is not the same as saving the race. Perhaps the race may survive a little longer if the system continued under such conditions, but the long-term prospects of the race would be no better than they are right now. </p>
<p>Even if, by some extraordinary means, Free Association was fully restored, immigration (both legal and illegal) was completely halted, and other major structural problems (such as education) were addressed, the prospects of the White race would still fail to improve substantially. Even with such changes (which won&rsquo;t come about anyway), differential fertility and the current socio-political structure would still guarantee that Whites would basically lose control of their destiny at some point in the 21st century. Non-Whites would continue to outbreed Whites, slowly but inexorably reducing them to minority status (with all of its implications). The media establishment, along with the corrupt political establishment, would effectively prevent Whites from even being able to assert their interests as a minority group. If people here think that the media will &#8216;miraculously&rsquo; change their tune once Whites become a minority, and suddenly encourage or even allow a meaningful White identity (which is a prerequisite for ethnic continuity), they are terribly mistaken. In all likelihood, the campaign will only intensify.</p>
<p>Conservatives will always lose, because they are obsessed with short-term progress, and they falsely believe that external conditions determine the course of society. Regardless of how abhorrent, ridiculous, or stupid the ideas of liberals might be, liberals are far superior in one critical area: they understand that culture and ideology are much more important than external features of society. They are radical and driven to push their ideas on society (for their own sick purposes, of course), whereas conseratives are essentially lethargic and unmoved by radical ideas. Liberals are motivated by ideas; conservatives (including conservatives who are racially conscious) are more concerned with material comfort, and with making sure that the chaos is at least kept below a certain point so that their businesses don&rsquo;t get disrupted, their children&rsquo;s schools don&rsquo;t deteriorate even further, etc. Sorry, but such a strategy is doomed to fail. Always has, and always will.</p>

<p>I think what you fail to understand is that this situation is a recent development, historically, and is created and maintained by incredible amounts of white resources.  If those resources were removed, the situation would immediately start to reverse.</p>
<p>What do you think would happen to Africa if all white aid suddenly stopped?  How about if it just tapered off over time?  Do you think blacks there would be able to maintain the basic resources to support themselves?  Do they show any propensity or inclination to do so whatsoever?  Heck no.  You&rsquo;d see an immense population die off.</p>
<p>My point is the world is the way it is today because whites choose it and no other reason.  And the very second we choose differently, things will be different.  A minor shift in what we promote with social programs (example subsidize high IQ people to have large families) and the elimination of welfare for anyone who can&rsquo;t pass a drug test would cause a dramatic population explosion among whites.  It wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple or three generations.</p>
<p>These people rely on direct handouts.  If we stop giving, they are in real trouble.</p>

		<p>I was surprised when I first heard that the soccer World Cup is going to be held in South Africa. First, because it is such a tremendously dangerous country, and second, one would think that the country&rsquo;s government would have more important things to focus on in a country that is so overwhelmed with problems.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m truly sorry for what happened to you.  However, please do not suggest that white men are not strong or beside you.  White men fight to the death to protect their women.  We have for thousands of years, and every sacrifice ever made in the name of Western civilization has been so that our women be kept from brutality at the hands of non-whites. Blame the black &#8220;men&#8221; who did this to you.  Blame the people who have intentionally engineered many white men into emasculated perma-children.  Blame those same individuals for throwing our society into chaos and letting those people out to prey on you. </p>
<p>Tom S. #5&rsquo;s remark was insensitive, but it does speak to how many liberal whites simply do not, or will not, accept that blacks are an eventual if not imminent physical danger to anyone around them, until it&rsquo;s too late.  In other words, some unfortunate white tourists at the World Cup will be very likely end up victimized, thus learning the hard way, and at some point, will possibly start frequenting AmRen. </p>

		<p>I advocate castration in these cases as an official state punishment.  The humiliation of being unmanned will be a far more powerful deterrent than the comfortingly familiar or even glamor-conferring confines of jail, or even death, which young males are eager to risk for thrills or status.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think what you fail to understand is that this situation is a recent development, historically, and is created and maintained by incredible amounts of white resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, I was referring to non-Whites who are already living in the United States. Like I said, even if, by divine intervention, those other changes I mentioned were to occur, Whites would still be reduced to minority status here because non-Whites would continue to outbreed them rapidly.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip; If those resources were removed, the situation would immediately start to reverse. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol, and what figure of probability should we put on that? 1%? Or, perhaps as a high as 2%?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip; What do you think would happen to Africa if all white aid suddenly stopped? How about if it just tapered off over time? Do you think blacks there would be able to maintain the basic resources to support themselves? Do they show any propensity or inclination to do so whatsoever? Heck no. You&rsquo;d see an immense population die off. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The accuracy of your prediction needn&rsquo;t even be addressed, since it is so unbelievably unlikely to happen in the first place. Your average White American is far more concerned with the next popular TV sitcom than with worldwide racial birthrates. However &#8216;awakened&rsquo; people on Amren might be, it&rsquo;s important to still keep one finger on the pulse of public opinion. There is no fundamental concern in White America for race. End of story.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip; My point is the world is the way it is today because whites choose it and no other reason. And the very second we choose differently, things will be different. A minor shift in what we promote with social programs (example subsidize high IQ people to have large families) and the elimination of welfare for anyone who can&rsquo;t pass a drug test would cause a dramatic population explosion among whites. It wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a couple or three generations. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>But where is the sentiment? In order for any racial/ethnic group to survive, it needs a firm sense of itself as a people; it must firmly be convinced of its uniqueness and sense of distance from other groups. &#8216;Whites&rsquo;   &mdash;   presuming that this category as used in the US today can even be accurately described as a legitimate &#8216;race&rsquo;   &mdash;   simply don&rsquo;t see things that way. In large part, this is because they have been completely bombarded and brainwashed by the media; and, as long as the media stays in the hands of people who have that agenda, they will not change their thinking. </p>
<p>The vast majority of people are trendy. They want to make sure that what they are thinking is also the thinking of at least a clear majority of other people in the society. In this era, the game has been rigged so that a small group of media masters can basically tilt things in the direction they want them to go, for their own selfish purposes. So far, there has been almost no organized opposition to this so far; there is almost no concern for the survival of the White race altogether, let alone a desire to &#8216;improve things&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All of those positive changes you describe still hinge on this factor, they hinge on a massive shift in the thinking of the masses. Unless some serious changes are made in regard to who controls the mass media, such a shift is simply inconceivable in this age. Amreners often love to talk about &#8216;popular opposition&rsquo; to things like immigration, but they only delude themselves if they think that more than a tiny percentage of this opposition is racially motivated. I would be willing to bet than no greater than 1% of individuals who oppose immigration in the US would be willing to go on record as saying that they oppose it specifically because of the negative impact it has on the racial balance/character of the US. </p>
<p>I agree with you that much of the problem has been caused by White confusion and White misplaced altruism; but, it is still important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t just going to &#8216;reverse itself&rsquo; magically. White people are NOT going to just wake up one day and go: &#8216;hey, birthrates are really getting out of hand; I guess we white people really need to get our thinking straight!&rsquo; This is sheer nonsense. Such a view is based on an naive understanding of what the average person is like (and, more important, what the average person is capable of). If White people really are going to survive the 21st century, I&rsquo;m convinced that it will not involve the same tactics that were used before, when conditions were completely different. New strategies will have to be adopted.</p>
