<h1>Few Young Blacks Pursue Medicine</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kym Klass, Montgomery Advertiser (Alabama), March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To Jefferson Underwood III, being one of the 4.4 percent of African-American doctors in the United States means there is a long way to go.</p>
<p>The Montgomery physician said this is the first generation of doctors not actively encouraging people to follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s because of all the problems that come with it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Malpractice, decreasing reimbursement  &mdash;  those who tend to get around those issues certainly are not coming back to Montgomery.&#8221;</p>
<p>African-Americans currently make up nearly 13 percent of the U.S. population but only 4.4 percent of all U.S. physicians and surgeons. They are considered an underrepresented minority (URM) in medicine, according to the Journal of the National Medical Association.</p>
<p>While African-Americans have many major advances in some fields during the past decades, the proportion of black physicians in the United States has changed little.</p>
<p>Despite affirmative action programs instituted by medical schools in the 1960s and 1970s, African- Americans comprised only 3.1 percent of all U.S. physicians in 1980.</p>
<p>Because affirmative action alone was unsuccessful in achieving diversity goals, in 1990 the Association of American Medical Colleges launched Project 3000 by 2000, an initiative to increase the number of these underrepresented minorities in medicine.</p>
<p>But instead of the hoped for 3,000, there were only about 1,700 underrepresented minorities in U.S. medical schools in 2000. The numbers peaked in 1994, but have since stagnated.</p>
<p>Cynthia Barginere, chief nursing officer and chief operating officer at Baptist Medical Center South, said the lack of African-American physicians is a national issue, an issue that has focused on schools and the lack of strong math and science programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From 2004 Census statistics of the U.S. Labor Department and of the American Medical Association, there are approximately 885,000 (884,974) doctors in the U.S. This represents about .29 percent of the population, or one-third of 1 percent. There is roughly one doctor to 300 people in the U.S.</p>
<p>Races other than Caucasians are significantly underrepresented. Caucasians represent 47.8 percent of all physicians. Black doctors only make up 2.3 percent, and Hispanic doctors about 3.2 percent. The largest minority percentage is made up of Asians, at 8.3 percent of all doctors.</p>
<p> &#8220;In terms of managed care, this is the first generation of doctors which is not actively encouraging people in their footsteps,&#8221; Underwood said. &#8220;People don&rsquo;t want to come to Montgomery not because of the past, but because of current problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Most African Americans are not privy to such role models in their lives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, we have to look at paying for medical school. We&rsquo;re considered public servants. Firemen don&rsquo;t have to pay to learn to be a fireman, policemen don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I have to pay to learn how to be a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if African Americans don&rsquo;t see a doctor role model, &#8220;you won&rsquo;t know how to be one,&#8221; Barginere said.</p>

		<p>Uh, those percents don&rsquo;t add to 100&hellip;Less than half are white?  Are they not including foreign doctors?</p>
<p>If somehow, magically, medical schools could pass enough blacks to be doctors, many of those blacks would have to go &#8220;serve&#8221; their own because whites and Asians want good doctors.  And then we all know what the story would be: &#8220;look at all the malpractice in minority areas. Why don&rsquo;t black areas get good doctors?  That&rsquo;s racism, blah blah blah.&#8221;  But there would be no public acknowledgment that the reason blacks have sucky doctors is because they have black doctors who were socially passed through medical school to fill a quota.  It&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on with all of these teacher stories now: affluent areas/private schools get the good teachers.  Why don&rsquo;t *urban* areas get good teachers?  That&rsquo;s unfair to blacks&hellip;</p>

		<p>As in so many other cases, comparing the number of African American doctors to the Black population as a whole is a misleading statistic. Blacks may represent 13% of the general pop., but they sure don&rsquo;t represent 13% of college graduates, a prerequisite of med school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also quibble with headline &#8220;Few Young Blacks Pursue Medicine,&#8221; and think that &#8220;Few Young <i>American</i> Born Blacks Pursue Medicine&#8221; would have been more accurate. </p>
<p>In my limited experience with hospitals in the DC Metro area, I&rsquo;ve never noticed a lack of color. However, I have definitely noticed the rarity of a non-white face coupled with an American accent. </p>

		<p>I am all for this, Obama and all of the federal Govt. should lead by example, when they need aid, demand &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; Doctors and Nurses. This would put an end to second terms, if you get my drift.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s unaware&hellip;or is ignoring&hellip;. the thousands of tests and the millions of real life cases showing that blacks cannot learn on a level that will enable them to grasp difficult concepts and abstract reasoning as well as complex terminologies and an ability to think and logic in clear cogent terms.  People with a group average I.Q. of 85 can learn only on a basic level.</p>

		<p>This is funny, because, to explain the absence of blacks in the technology sector, apologists have argued that blacks prefer to go into &#8220;the helping professions.&#8221; So how, then, do we explain the lack of blacks in medicine as well?</p>
<p><i>At the end of the day, if African Americans don&rsquo;t see a doctor role model, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t know how to be one,&rdquo; Barginere said.</i></p>
<p>Oh, I see. Did you ever hear about picking up a book, say one called &#8220;Black Role Models to Emulate?&#8221; No, of course not. This is blacks we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>

		<p>Pay close attention to the lies, such as these, from the article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most African Americans are not privy to such role models in their lives. Also, we have to look at paying for medical school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both statements are lies.  First, our media is saturated 24/7 with favorable images of Blacks and Hispanics as physicians.  Can you name a TV show or a movie in which there are not Minority doctors in scenes of hospitals?  Also, open any K-12 textbook.  Every other page shows some Minority in some position of power or achievement.  Finally, in majority Minority high schools, there are numerous motivational speakers (People of Color) who come in and talk about opportunities for Minorities.  Even our President and a sizable proportion of his staff are Minorities.  </p>
<p>The second comment about paying for Med School is also a lie.  Most Blacks accepted into Medical school are richly supported with financial aid or are given government-backed loans.  In some cases, Black med-school students receive as much as $60,000/yr, and medical-field graduate students receive as much as $40,000/year in tuition, fees, book, room &amp; board, research, &amp; travel costs.  I know, because I work at a university.  Not all Blacks receive massive financial aid, but virtually all but those from rich families receive some sort of financial support.</p>

		<p>For some reason these percentages aren&rsquo;t adding up.  If Asians, hispanics, and blacks each make up a percentage of under 10% of all physicians, then how are whites less than 50%?  Not only do these numbers not add up, but I guess I don&rsquo;t want them to add up.  If whites are now under 50% of doctors then we are in trouble.</p>
<p>As a white person I only go to white doctors. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why white people are so fascinated with Indian doctors.  I don&rsquo;t want any doctor from the Third World examining me.  If I must go to a nonwhite doctor, he or she will be Japanese.</p>
<p>I have read some articles from Great Britain going into how most doctors over there are Indian.  Is that really true?  That is absurd! Where did we get this idea that Indians make better doctors than whites?</p>
<p>It is not just a matter of physical safety but a visit to the doctor usually involves intimate touching and shedding of clothes.  We don&rsquo;t need hordes of brown people flooding into Western countries and making a lot of money in a top of the ladder profession that involves groping and feeling white peoples&rsquo; naked bodies.  What have we come to?</p>
<p>The older women in my family are obsessed with Indian male OBGYNs and I personally find that sickening and repulsive!</p>

With blacks, it always takes something extra to make them appear to be on par with whites. Affirmative action, lowered standards, and extra tutoring. Even with all the extras, they still fail to meet white numbers.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re desperate to get black doctors and they&rsquo;re willing to put in all the extra effort, fine. Just be sure they end up practicing medicine in minority communities so minority kids can have the black doctor role models they need to become black doctors as well. After all, this is the criticism and reason given for the problem.</p>
<p>But as others have pointed out, if these black doctors aren&rsquo;t as good as white doctors, blacks are going to be screaming &#8216;racism&rsquo; for any number of reasons.</p>
<p>As always, when it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s always lose-lose.</p>

<p>Oh, how I agree with you Courtney! How any White woman can go to a nonwhite doctor to be examined is appalling. Problem is there are so few White doctors any longer that will take medicare. I am elderly and I cannot find one. I have to go to Kaiser and most doctors are not White. I found a nonwhite woman doctor and I figured she would be better than some nonwhite male doctor. Our city is full of nonwhite doctors and foreign doctors and it is only getting worse  As for Indian doctors being better than White doctors, that is a joke and a lie. My son had to go to an Indian doctor and he said he would never go back. </p>

		<p>I am a physician - I&rsquo;ve been in practice for nearly 20 years (internal medicine). The above is all nonsense. The excuse of no role models, weak science programs in high school, lack of money, etc&hellip;is simply smoke and mirrors. The issue is intelligence. </p>
<p>Medicine, as a profession, despite its problems and hassles, is still a very rewarding field that also happens to pay well. This is obvious to many Asians and whites who apply to medical school. Accordingly, it should also be obvious to blacks. However, despite all the high self-esteem happy talk in public schools and college programs where blacks are enrolled (&#8220;You can be anything you want to be!&#8221;) when it comes down to it most blacks wash-out of pre-med programs before they even apply to med school. </p>
<p>Unlike law school or business school, medical schools require completion of university-level courses in chemistry, biology, math,and physics before being able to apply, not to mention taking the MCAT. Organic chemistry and calculus are not courses that can be subjectively graded like &#8220;black studies&#8221; and they also require a good deal more work. I&rsquo;d say 75% of the black students in my undergraduate pre-med courses never even made it to the final exam. There were only 5 black students in my med school class of 170 - three did not graduate. </p>
<p>In medicine, the unspoken understanding is that black doctors are generally unqualified AA admits and sadly, their performance mirrors this belief. I know of no white physician who has, or would have, a black as their personal doctor regardless of what they say publicly. </p>
<p>The current health reform bill has regulations hidden inside which mandate increases in black med school enrollment - this will totally damage the profession. Blacks, in all seriousness, do not belong in medicine. They are simply not up to the academic standards needed. In comparative biology we all learned about IQ and genetics - believe me, most doctors know that someone with an IQ of 80 should not be writing prescriptions or holding a scalpel.     </p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the author complains about the lack of math and science and yet she and her editor fail to comprehend math at even the lowest levels. For the record, .29% is approximately 1 in 345. </p>

		<p>blacks are absent in large numbers from every area requiring high IQ.<br>
all efforts to achieve parity has failed for this reason.</p>
<p>we have now entered into the era of forced schizophrenia:</p>
<p>everyone knows that the United States makes enormous efforts to achieve parity, stacks the deck in favor of blacks through quota programs.<br>
they have been a protected race legally for 50 years, yet have failed to succeed in fields like medicine because these require high IQ.</p>
<p>everywhere knows this, everyone has always known this, we could continue another thousand years with quotas and white guilt without anything really changing.</p>
<p>without quotas to induct substandard blacks into the medical field, the percentage of black doctors would probably be around 1%, but at least they would be competent.</p>
<p>as it is, medical care is where most white&rsquo;s system of denial about racial difference breaks down: <br>
we are stark staring terrified of having a black doctor because we know he is unlikely to competent.</p>

		<p><i>Races other than Caucasians are significantly underrepresented. Caucasians represent 47.8 percent of all physicians. Black doctors only make up 2.3 percent, and Hispanic doctors about 3.2 percent. The largest minority percentage is made up of Asians, at 8.3 percent of all doctors.</i><br>
<p><br>
According to the figures given, it is a lie that races other than Caucasians are significantly underrepresented. I just went and looked up the current percentage of the U.S. population that is Asian. Asians are only 4.4% of the population. This means that Asians are vastly overrepresented, by a margin of almost 90%. </p>

		<p>If the blacks do not master medicine in the industrialized world, they would easily be admitted into medical school in South Africa, where the education has been dumbed down to a level where 50% of the blacks pass. That level is so low, that asian and white student need special skills not to get stright A&rsquo;s. After Philemon finishing medical school, he&rsquo;ll get a training position in one of the medical specialities because of his skin, and here he sit with the index finger up in the nostril for 5 years, failing the internationally levelled exams, and when the time is over, he&rsquo;s given a new training post in another speciality, just to fix his indexfinger in the same nostril for another, new 5 years, effectively blocking the specialist training to such a degree that the number of training positions has quadruppeled the last 10 years, just to make sure some get through. </p>

		<p>Blacks are not intelligent enough to qualify for med school generally.  I.Q. is an important tool to determine whether or not individuals have the ability to learn certain subjects.  It tells us that it is useless to encourage people with low I.Q.&rsquo;s to pursue difficult subjects like engineering, physics, and medicine.  Blacks, as a group, mostly do not have the intellect necessary to pursue these kinds of subjects.  It&rsquo;s a waste of time and money, and if they&rsquo;re pushed through the system anyway, there are apt to be many unnecessary deaths due to physician incompetence.</p>
<p>That danger is of no consequence to the community organizer.  He will never have to settle for incompetent care, and he doesn&rsquo;t really care if the vast majority of people do.  His main concern is getting unqualified blacks into professional positions by any means necessary and then lie about it when they screw up.</p>
<p>Therefore, the important mandates in the healthcare bill are being overlooked.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Well, for one, there&rsquo;s a stipulation that med schools will be required to have a certain number of non-whites (read blacks) whether they&rsquo;re qualified or not.</p>
<p>And there are bound to be other requirements just as bad that will benefit blacks someway or this black liar wouldn&rsquo;t be so rabidly, crazily pushing for passage against all evidence that the bill will increase premiums and will be worse than having nothing at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see one of these investigative talk show hosts&hellip;.like Glenn Beck&hellip;.dig into the matter and reveal just exactly what these horrors are that are buried deep within this bill.</p>
<p>This black miscreant in charge, Holder, and his other pro-black radical appointees are going to bring this system down on everybody&rsquo;s head.  I just know it.  As the cliche goes, &#8220;I can feel it in my bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The average Af-Am has an IQ of 85, whereas a mediocre physician probably needs 110 minimum. Only a tiny percentage of blacks would qualify without the scales being tilted to them  &mdash;   less than the 4% cited here.</p>
<p>Also, as Michael Levin showed in &#8216;Why Race Matters&rsquo;, blacks are innately oriented towards immediate rewards and short mental horizons. Medicine is not a job most are attuned to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in an ER, pray you don&rsquo;t get a black doctor. That&rsquo;s where the AA hires tend to finish up, making fast decisions about matters of life and death that kill too many of their bruthas and sistas.</p>

		<p>I happen to be taking some health care related classes at the local CC.  One power point slide show on the GI system featured a still of an elderly woman with her back to the camera, but obviously white, prepared for a colonoscopy.  While the masked attendants, all white or hispanic females stood by, a black MD stood, looking at the camera with the scope in his hand, unmasked, with a big, cheesy smile.  Some students made comments and laughed about the photo. They were all females and mostly white.  I later pointed out to the white male instructor that this photo should have never been made, let alone shown in class.  It was a violation of patient dignity, an ethical situation.  &#8220;This is Abu Gruaib, I said.&#8221; A light went on in his head. He suddenly saw the wrong of it.  It wasn&rsquo;t his photo he claimed, but another instructor, an Englishman who teaches a related class.</p>
<p>This is a community college with a big emphasis on Diversity; propaganda everywhere, including in its mission statement.  The inclusiveness has driven even the limited number of white male instructors to try to fit in by including photos of black doctors acting the way they do wherever they may be.  These white guys seem to have a pathetic need to appear cool and funny to their students.  What all this is producing is less and less professionalism and more probable medical errors.</p>

<p>There are lots of demographics on Doctors - just use Google/Bing to find them. More or less, 80% are non-Hispanic White (and Jewish), 10% Asian, 5% Hispanic, 3% African-American, and 2% other.</p>
<p>The Hispanic and Asian numbers will probably rise over time, with Asians rising at a higher rate.</p>
<p>African-Americans can&rsquo;t &#8220;fake&#8221; their way through Medical school, science exams, etc. that&rsquo;s the issue. In any field where &#8220;faking it&#8221; can be tolerated by the profession, African-Americans will be pushed through.  Where &#8220;faking it&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t work, you won&rsquo;t find African-Americans.</p>
<p>Typical P.C. delusions - all people have to be seen as having the same &#8220;potential&#8221; and therefore we just need to provide the right environment (i.e. spend $$$$) to have more African-American doctors. </p>

Big insurance just doesn&rsquo;t want to pay out for lawsuits.  The reason malpractice insurance is high is because of insurance companies, not lawsuits.  California has the most restrictive medical tort rules in the country, but does this mean that health care in CA is cheaper?  No.  As a matter of fact, we&rsquo;re gonna need generous medical tort provisions in order to sue hospitals and affirmative action doctors for their ever-increasing blatant mistakes and gross incompetence in the near future.</p>

<p>Whites seek Indian doctors because, for the millions of us who have been shoehorned into managed care, our choices are very limited and Indian doctors are often the only alternative to black doctors.

		<p>If it is true that the figures show the lack of black doctors and blacks in technology, you must also project back to the attitudes that existed when these who would have been doctors today, were in grade school, high school and college. I recall that especially in the urban cities no one cared if we were educated or not. Many of us were not prepared for higher education. There was no push, no intent and no teachers of quality. Perhaps I would been an architect were it not for the alcoholic math teachers in our school. When I got to college on a scholarship for architecture because I had vision, and I could draw, I had to drop out because I had no math skills. No prep yesterday, no doctors or architects today.</p>
<p>To console myself and distract myself I watched TV. No black heroes or role models there. Today TV has more blacks and there are some serious efforts in the schools. This should prove to boost the number of blacks in higher education, tomorrow but not today.</p>
<p>You have to tell kids the door is open from the get. If the culture in the kids environment supports this push they will go through the door.  </p>

The ivy league takes Blacks who are good enough for the better state schools, and the better state schools, robbed of their legitimate freshmen, take in Black students that really belong in run-of-the-mill schools.  The run-of-the-mill state schools take in the Black high school grads who ought be in a trade school.  This results in higher dropout rates than if Blacks were placed in schools that were not beyond them.  Look up Thomas Sowell, he has had a lot to say about this in the past. </p>
