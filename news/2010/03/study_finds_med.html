			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Grant, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women of all races bring home less income and own fewer assets, on average, than men of the same race, but for single black women the disparities are so overwhelmingly great that even in their prime working years their median wealth amounts to only $5.</p>
<p>In a groundbreaking report released Monday by a leading economic research group, social scientists turned a spotlight on the grave financial challenges facing an often overlooked group of women, many of whom could not take an unpaid sick day or repair a major appliance without going into debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s rather shocking,&#8221; said Meizhu Lui, director of the Closing the Gap Initiative based in Oakland, Calif., who contributed to the report &#8220;Lifting as We Climb: Women of Color, Wealth and America&rsquo;s Future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the most startling revelations in the wealth data is that while single white women in the prime of their working years (ages 36 to 49) have a median wealth of $42,600 (still only 61 percent of their single white male counterparts), the median wealth for single black women is only $5.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even for those of us who have been looking at the wealth gap for a while, we were shocked and amazed at how little women of color have,&#8221; Ms. Lui said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wealth, or net worth, measures the total of one&rsquo;s assets  &mdash;  cash in the bank, stocks, bonds and real estate; minus debts  &mdash;  home mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and student loans. The most recent financial data was collected before the economic downturn, so the current numbers likely are worse now than at the time of the study.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The popular image is they spend too much, which is the reason they are running up credit card and consumer debt, but the cost of living has risen faster than income, and they need to go into debt for basic daily necessities,&#8221; Ms. Lui said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s compounded because unemployment is twice as high in the black community than it is in the white community.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all working-age black women 18 to 64, the financial picture is bleak. Their median household wealth is only $100. Hispanic women in that age group have a median wealth of $120.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means half of [black women] have a net worth of more than $100 and half have a net worth of less than $100,&#8221; Ms. Lui said. &#8220;So that gives you an idea of how far in debt some women of color are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Married or cohabitating white women have a median wealth of $167,500. Married or cohabitating black women have a median net worth of $31,500.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a recent report by the Institute for Women&rsquo;s Policy Research and the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania, more than four out of 10 families headed by single mothers in Pittsburgh and more than one in three in Pennsylvania, live in poverty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a 2008 study of black women and their money, the ING Foundation found that black women  &mdash;  who frequently manage the assets of their households  &mdash;  financially support friends, family and their houses of worship to a much greater degree than the general population.</p>
<p>They also are more likely to be employed in jobs and industries  &mdash;  such as service occupations  &mdash;  with lower pay and less access to health insurance. And when their working days are done, they rely most heavily on Social Security because they are less likely to have personal savings, retirement accounts or company pensions. Their Social Security benefits are likely to be lower, too, because of their low earnings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>High unemployment and high incarceration rates for black men also lower the likelihood of single black women finding a partner to help build a more secure financial future.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that black women are going into debt for basic necessities, it&rsquo;s because so many of them go into debt for frivolous things, and therefore have to go into debt even further for necessities.  And, as the article alludes to, black women that have something have every relative and &#8220;boo&#8221; wanting drug and bail money.</p>

		<p>I am confused, I remember reading a report last year that claimed income for black women in the USA was a tiny bit higher than white women in the USA and Asian men out-earned white men. Of course the article is about assets and not income but still if black women out-earn white women it would have been a good fact to include in the article.<br>

		<p>What this says to me is that black women had best learn the hard truth that GETTING A DECENT EDUCATION is the ticket to creating a decent financial life.  The problem is, the black women who DO get the needed education and the good jobs are hounded continually by their no-good have-not relatives for money, and they capitulate out of guilt.  So black women also have to learn to say &#8220;NO&#8221; to family members who ask for money.  Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough one - but my own line is, &#8220;Do I look like a bank to you?&#8221;  And if they go, &#8220;Yeah, but&hellip;&#8221;  I respond, &#8220;Yeah, BUT is the mating call of the a**hole!&#8221;  You have to get out of that circle of poverty and go create your own life.</p>

		<p>Are welfare paymenets and other such &#8220;entitlements&#8221; included in this $5 figure? Thought not! Go on photobucket or youtube and look up &#8220;Donks&#8221; &#8220;HoopDees&#8221; and look at a $500 car with $12,000 worth of wheels/tires and associated work and notice the owners and spectators! blacks appreciate, NAY, NEED bling to the sacrifice of necessities since welfare pays for all that.</p>

		<p>This article is a tad misleading to the rookie observer.  </p>
<p>On face value, black ghetto women &#8220;earn&#8221; at the bottom of the charts, but earning from honest labor is is not their goal nor is it an honorable thing to do. It&rsquo;s getting &#8220;free money&#8221; from the government and set-asides.  They actually earn neighborhood respect by the amounts they take in from the taxpayers. </p>
<p>Black women in larger cities go for the social security benefits along with state and local money.  For example, they file a claim that at least one of their children is &#8220;learning disabled&#8221; or &#8220;mentally retarded&#8221; in order to get monthly &#8220;crazy checks&#8221;, as they call them, to go along with the amounts already received by their little walking welfare check. It works in bigger cities because the social security offices therein are staffed by blacks who almost never say &#8220;no&#8221; to a black applicant. That has to do with sticking it to white people, as the black social security workers see it. </p>
<p>Now lets see a study of their incomes from welfare and its in-kind benefits such as WIC and food stamps.  They approach a solid middle class earning scale if such was tallied. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what the racial group values most that reflects earned income, and blacks, as a group, reject learning, careers, and individual responsibility.   </p>

If you adhere to a few rules anyone can do well here.<br>
 <br>
1. go as far as you can with your education<br>
2. Do not use drugs<br>
3. Do not have children that you cannot support<br>
4. Do not break the law</p>
<p>Every &#8220;poor&#8221; person in America has atleast one or two of these.</p>

		<p>I think things may be looking up for black women to find employment. Reading the YAHOO mail things, I see that tens of thousands of jobs are open in the &#8220;social services&#8221; area and &#8220;federal government&#8221; both of which can be read as &#8220;blacks only need apply&#8221; I wonder what the actual number of<br>

		<p>Part of the heritage of slavery. Blacks feel that they are not respected, and will try to gain respect by spending a lot of money on goods that display status: expensive-looking clothing, a flashy automobile, etc. The secretary at my workplace arrives in a Lexus SUV  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s probably leased, but still it has to eat up most of her paycheck. And she is middle-class, with fairly good taste  &mdash;  most African Americans have terrible taste, and their efforts to display status are laughable (one word: &#8220;bling&#8221;). </p>

		<p>Poster #12 has a great point.  I have found that when one minority is involved in a report about &#8216;injustice&rsquo; and such, if their particular group is doing better than the subject of the report, they don&rsquo;t mention their own group.</p>
<p>I say that the social justice types need to be called out on the floor and asked why wealthy Asians are not being forced to integrate their neighborhood.  Why are they not being asked to integrate schools in which they are now a majority?  </p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t teach for America recruit mostly Asians to go and work in the inner city ghettos.  (Oh, I forgot, the blacks and latinos disrespect asians in a very blatant way.)  Why aren&rsquo;t blacks and latinos being called out on their anti-asian biases? Why aren&rsquo;t latinos and blacks being forced to love each other and integrate, instead of always displacing each other? </p>
<p>I could go on, but the point is, we need to turn the tables now on the social justice and make them turn the eye of scrutiny on each other.  The glaring contradictions of their movement will cause it to fall apart.</p>

What the &hellip; ???</p>
<p>They just can not handle money, that is everything. Same in Europe. They are not made to think about tomorrow. They just think about now.<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t matter wether they came from Africa or are in USA for 300 years, doesn&rsquo;t matter wether they live in the ghetto or in good nightborhoods, where the government take them into to integrate them, it is always the same. Instead of integrating, the whole nightborhood gets like &hellip; you know it.</p>

<p><br>
Every society evolves its own system that&rsquo;s best suited to its needs.</p>
<p>Representative democracy is, in fact, a very new thing on the world stage, existing only for the past couple of centuries &hellip;(and much less than that outside the USA&hellip;In much of Europe it is not even a century old.  Elsewhere,  e.g. Japan, it is even less).   In other words, it is an anomalous blip in the history of the world, where aristocratic clans and powerful minorities have ALWAYS ruled the masses since the recording of history began.  Historically, minority rule is FAR more common than the reverse.</p>
<p>In the USA, for the past two centuries, representative democracy has served us well   &mdash;   all of us, including the &#8220;minorities&#8221;   &mdash;    while we whites constituted the majority; but that era may be ending.  What I am saying, then, is that we may have to find new ways of governance.  Things change with time, inevitably. Nothing remains the same.  We are not bound inflexibly to the old system forever;  and we can be sure that the new majority will not respect it.  Why should we?  A new solution for a new situation may have to be found.<br>

<p>Not just that!  There are MANY other entitlement and wealth-distribution schemes, benefits, and programs - both governmental and non-governmental (ie, via churches and wealthy foundations)   &mdash;    many of those so well disguised and indirect that you wouldn&rsquo;t even be aware of it without doing some research.</p>

		<p>Back in the early 80s, I had a Guatemalan maid/nanny who was trying to earn and save enough money to provide a decent life for her mother and two children back in Guatemala.  On the weekends, she stayed with her Guatemalan relatives in the Hispanic part of town, and every time she managed to save some money, one or more of them would pressure her into handing it over to him.  I felt very sorry for her, because her dream of a decent lifestyle back in Guatemala was endlessly postponed.  Every week that she worked in America was another week away from her children, without reaching the financial goal that would allow her to go home.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In the wacky world of equality in results, perhaps the higher performing Asians should be taxed extra to compensate the lesser performing blacks.&#8221; Well, to they extent they earn more money, they already do, Even if we had a flat tax rate, higher earning people would be paying more, which would in turn fund transfer payments. If Asians are already earning significantly more than the median national income, then they are also already being taxed extra, under our mildly progressive income tax system. Please also remember that the so called &#8220;welfare system&#8221; spends three dollars on overhead to deliver one dollar of service - with private charities it is the reverse ration at worst, while champs such as Ocfam deliver 98% of what they collet as goods or services. Add this all together, and it is not a great time to be poor in this ountry.</p>

		<p>How can the researchers have confidence in such a precise figure? Five dollars, not seven, not negative three&hellip; They had better time-stamp that result, because inflation will alter it significantly in just a few months.</p>
<p>I suspect the five-dollar figure is&hellip;quotable but meaningless, <i>perfect</i> for a generation of reporters and social scientists.</p>

		<p>25 Anon: Aristocracy is the normal form of government.  Democracy is a temporary social disturbance that will correct itself.  The unusual situation that allowed it to develop and prosper has changed, so a return to a traditional form of government is called for.  There are a number of successful models in our own history, so we needn&rsquo;t look to alien peoples for ideas.  Our Rulers detest representative government, of course, and strive to make the country ungovernable by anything but tyrannical means.  Their model of aristocratic rule is non-Western, anything from ancient Persian despotism to 20th Century Stalinism, brutal to the core.  We should perhaps look to 16th or 18th Century England, or the better centuries of the Roman Republic or Empire for our examples.  </p>

		<p>This is obviously nonsense. Isn&rsquo;t it true that they get a fortune in material goods from food stamps?  They&rsquo;re covered for all kinds of things like <b>free diapers, free prescription eyeglasses and sometimes, free TVs.</b></p>
<p>PROOF:</p>
<p>Sharon Jasper, welfare queen. This is the one who decries <br>
living on welfare while owning a 60-inch flat-screen TV. <br>
She complains that <b>it&rsquo;s not a real plasma TV</b>; and the reason <br>
they won&rsquo;t give her a &#8220;real Plasma&#8221;? &hellip;because she&rsquo;s black. </p>

<p>So this is the clearest case of jaundiced statistics in recent memory. They had to fudge those numbers every which way to come up with that $5 figure. </p>
