<h1>Turn Off the Tap</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Bissett, Ottawa Citizen, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Industry Minister Tony Clement has bemoaned the fact that Canada&rsquo;s unemployment figures are at an &#8220;unacceptable level&#8221; and claims that job creation is a top priority of the federal government. If the minister is serious about this he might then well ask his colleague, Jason Kenny, the Immigration Minister, why our immigration levels are at such unprecedented high levels when there are 1.3 million men and women looking for work.</p>
<p>In the past two years while the country has been in the midst of a serious recession 483,000 immigrants entered Canada. In addition to the immigrants, in 2008 alone, 192,519 temporary foreign workers entered and joined the 170,975 who were already here  &mdash;  for an amazing total of 363,494. Why such high volumes if indeed the government is worried about job losses? Are ministers not aware that in the first year of recession Canada lost 486,000 full-time jobs and within the next few months 810,000 workers will run out of unemployment benefits?</p>
<p>In the past when Canada was entering into an economic downturn it was customary to turn the immigration tap off or at least to slow it down. The rationale was simple  &mdash;  what was the point in bringing to Canada immigrants who would find it difficult to find employment, and why make it more difficult for unemployed Canadians workers to get back to work?</p>
<p>However, for the past 20 years governments have set immigration levels extraordinarily high, aiming for about 250,000 per annum regardless of economic or labour force conditions. As the number of applications increased, an enormous backlog has piled up. In June of 2008 it was estimated to be between 900,000 and 950,000. Now it probably exceeds one million.</p>
<p>The staggering number of foreign temporary workers entering Canada is a direct result of the inability of visa officers overseas to deal with the high volume of immigration set by the government targets. Canadian employers trying to avoid lengthy immigration delays hire foreign temporary workers instead. They frequently engage agents abroad to select and recruit the workers.</p>
<p>Since many of these workers do not have to undergo normal criminal and security checks, they are able to get to Canada faster and avoid the backlog. Many of the workers are unskilled with poor language qualifications and it is known they pay agents large sums of money to be chosen for Canada. How many of them will eventually return home is an open question.</p>
<p>One of the serious consequences of reliance on temporary workers is the danger of falling into the same trap as many of the western European countries in the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s when they lost control of their guest worker and asylum programs. These countries suddenly  &mdash;  but too late  &mdash;  realized they had inadvertently created a massive underclass residing in their major urban centres.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the immigrants arriving since the early 1990s are not doing as well as those from earlier times. Many are living below the poverty line and immigrants between the ages of 25 and 54 have a much higher unemployment rate than the native born.</p>
<p>Only about 18 per cent of immigrants are selected by the federal government because they possess the skills, training or education needed to fill labour shortages. By far the greater numbers are selected because they are sponsored by relatives who are already in Canada or they are admitted for humanitarian reasons, are refugees, or are chosen by the provinces.</p>
<p>The reality is that for a number of years now the costs of immigration have exceeded the benefits and the long-range economic, social and environmental implications of continuing such high levels  &mdash;  especially during times of economic uncertainty  &mdash;  have not been taken into account by governments.</p>
<p>Our political representatives have a responsibility  &mdash;  if not a duty  &mdash;  to address important issues of public policy. It is high time they took a hard and intelligent look at our immigration policy and in a non-partisan fashion introduce measures to ensure that immigration serves the interests of Canada. This is not happening now, and now is not the time for our politicians to opt out.</p>
<p>James Bissett is former executive director of the Canadian Immigration Service.<br>

		<p>&#8220;If the minister is serious about this he might then well ask his colleague, Jason Kenny, the Immigration Minister, why our immigration levels are at such unprecedented high levels when there are 1.3 million men and women looking for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason is very simple:  The multicults pushing for more immigration are people who are mentally and/or emotionally ill, and people so afflicted have bizarre thoughts, actions, and they set goals that are based in some form of emotional turmoil and/or mental disorder.  </p>
<p>They could well be included in the definition of a fanatic, described by someone as, &#8220;One who once having lost sight of his goal redoubles his efforts.&#8221;<br>

<p>Everyone knows why - an immigrant who steps off a plane immediately is in need of food, shelter, warmth, and clothing.  Within an hour of arriving, he has probably purchased a meal, used transportation and energy, drank water from the utilities, and begun to satisfy his need for heat, energy and shelter.</p>
<p>The spike in national consumption is instantly perceptible when 600 immigrants arrive per day. This is exactly the reason for &#8220;unprecedented high levels&#8221; of immigration - the financial elites calling the shots want growth across all levels of national consumption.</p>
<p>An unemployment crisis matters little to them, as it is someone else&rsquo;s problem.   </p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;d like to read a book length study of immigration problems in Canada, here&rsquo;s a recent one from the Fraser Institute. The author of this news article has a chapter in the book.</p>

<p>Canada desperately needs an immigration reform organization similar to Numbers USA or FAIR in the US. There are several prominent Canadians who are critical of immigration who could join together to form an organization. Along with James Bisset I&rsquo;m aware of Diane Francis and Martin Colacott.</p>

		<p><b>&#8220;Why bring in more immigrants when so many Canadians are unemployed?&#8221; </b></p>
<p>An easy one to answer. Because this is NOT about employment!  It is about diluting the population and weakening the white Christian majority. The more squabbling, disunited, minorities the better. The easier to divide and rule them.  All this prattle that we hear so constantly, about employment and economic statistics, is just a red herring to distract people away from the real goal   &mdash;   which is Diversity&hellip;. Diversity at any cost. </p>
<p>Of course, other things get attached to the package to make it, overall, more attractive to various elements (business, religious, ethnic, and gullible college students) and to lure their support or at least their compliance.</p>
<p>Also, while I absolutely agree with ranger&rsquo;s definition of the multicultis as emotionally afflicted &#8220;fanatics&#8221; (many of them), that description applies only to the lower-level Useful Idiots who have been &#8220;converted&#8221; to The Cause and who have been turned against their own people.  Those silly fools would be attracted to any trendy fad; they need an excuse for living, and have no idea what they are really doing. </p>
<p>However, the sinister ideologues and manipulators behind the scenes, the people who set the agenda, and who control the Useful Idiots, are by no means wacky or mentally ill. They know EXACTLY what they are doing. Don&rsquo;t misjudge your enemy! This vast worldwide scenario that we see taking shape could not be so well conceived, so thought-out in every detail, and so impressively effective as it is, if it were conceived by deranged lunatics and nutcases. They are determined to reduce white majorities everywhere to a level where those whites can no longer present any threat or any resistance. And they are succeeding! The people who led a determined forty-year campaign to topple America&rsquo;s immigration laws (and finally succeeded) were not preoccupied with issues about jobs and unemployment. It was a matter of ideology and personal/ethnic revenge.</p>
<p>This worldwide phenomenon has NOTHING to do with employment statistics (although cheap third-world labor is an added benefit to seduce the owner class); and those baffled people who are striving to understand this in terms of employment are simply barking up the wrong tree. There is no answer to be found there. Wake up, people! That&rsquo;s NOT what it&rsquo;s all about!  Your displacement is what it&rsquo;s all about.  Our hidden rulers (and I don&rsquo;t mean our politicians, who are just front people)  are electing a new, more dumbed-down, more manageable, forever disunited, public.</p>

		<p>That such plain-faced, obviously rational, factual arguments and PLEAS are made&hellip;and ignored with a yawn by &#8220;elected&#8221; governments, signals that republican government, along with freedom, and family identity are quickly dying.<br>
This ramrodding of the third world upon the white, developed world will proceed at breakneck speed, accelerating to a cataclysm, either because the greedy traitors got their way (resulting in all out race war), or because they collapsed in their blind, rapacious grab at the freedom of all civilized men<br>
(resulting in a revolution that created separate, militantly enforced racial states).<br>
Either way, the white world is in suspended animation at best, dead at worst. It will be revived in a bloodbath brought about not by decent whites who hate NO ONE, and only wish to survive, but by the one corporation, one world usurpers.<br>
Sounds dramatic, but would George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, The Adamses,  Andrew Jackson or Teddy Roosevelt characterize this debacle in lesser terms?<br>
Hell no, the aforementioned American ICONS would scream bloody murder, and make a call to outright war, and would themselves hang the traitors and greedy warmongers from the highest trees. Old Hickory had some choice and brave words for would -be traitors (the slave-holding ruiners of the historic nation.). BTW, the neocons are the inheritors of the slave-holder&rsquo;s legacy and purpose: to enslave everybody but themselves, even whites.<br>
We are staring at the slaveholders reincarnated. Their mission is unchanged. Our lives are at stake.</p>

		<p><i>&hellip;many of these [foreign] workers do not have to undergo normal criminal and security checks&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Wonderful&hellip;a nice setup for bringing in even more terrorists and their supporters to Canada, as if they don&rsquo;t get enough from other channels of legal and illegal immigration. I&rsquo;m sure many, like the asylum seekers, end up absconding to the US to join or support terror cells.</p>
<p><i>Many of the workers are unskilled with poor language qualifications and it is known they pay agents large sums of money to be chosen for Canada. How many of them will eventually return home is an open question.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet it would be exactly zero if the imported workers had a say in the matter. They&rsquo;re only coming to work so they can weasel themselves into a nice, comfy liberal welfare-state. A timely on-the-job accident or cries of &#8220;political persecution&#8221; back home will have them set for life in the white man&rsquo;s world. Not much chance of them &#8220;paying their way&#8221; or supporting the growing retirement demographic in Canada.</p>
<p>BTW, how do people who are &#8220;unskilled&#8221; get the &#8220;large sums of money&#8221; described here? My guess would be a radical Muslim organization, or maybe one of those bleeding-heart &#8220;Christian&#8221; pro-immigrant organizations.</p>

		<p>Why bring in nonwhite immgrants into Canada for any reason? What if the economy was booming? Would this be a good reason to bring in hindus,sihks and chinese? Only if you want to race-replace the White Canadian majority&hellip;.which has already happened in Vancuover. There is no cultural,economic,demographc and ecological reason for importing nonwhites into Canada and America.</p>

		<p>Same situation here in South Africa - Plenty of unemployed white engineers, doctors etc, but they import non-whites from elsewhere to do these jobs. Remember too that whites are very much in the minority here and we have Affirmative Action laws that discriminate against white folk in favour of the majority black population;  Nothing whatsoever is said by anti-discrimination organizations anywhere outside of this country! A company or government department can legally decline your job application (and indeed some companies must, to avoid &#8220;Employment Equity&#8221; fines!) simply because you are white&hellip;.</p>
<p>Please think of those of us who are unable to leave this hellhole due to financial circumstances! Many would love to leave, but even if we could, where would we go? Anti-white feelings are everywhere!</p>
