			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca Camber, Daily Mail (London), March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police officers have been banned from asking for &#8216;Christian&rsquo; names for fear of offending other religions.</p>
<p>Officers taking down a suspect&rsquo;s particulars must now refer to their &#8216;personal&rsquo; or &#8216;family name&rsquo; as the word &#8216;Christian&rsquo; could offend Muslims, Sikhs and other faiths, according to new diversity guidelines.</p>
<p>They state bobbies on the beat should refrain from using phrases such as &#8216;my dear&rsquo; or &#8216;love&rsquo;, when addressing women for fear it may cause embarrassment or offence.</p>
<p>Well-meaning gestures like handshakes or putting a comforting arm around a victim or grieving family member are also prohibited as it could be deemed &#8216;unprofessional&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The handbook produced by Kent Police, which aims to &#8216;promote clearer communication&rsquo; and &#8216;break down barriers&rsquo; with diverse communities, advises officers to avoid language like &#8216;Christian&rsquo; name or surname.</p>
<p>They are also warned not to use terms like afternoon or evening as it could confuse people of &#8216;different cultural backgrounds&rsquo; about the time of day.</p>
<p>The 62-page &#8216;Faith and Culture Resource&rsquo; booklet produced by the force&rsquo;s diversity support group sets out customs and practices in a number of religions and beliefs including paganism and rastafarianism.</p>
<p>In it, officers are told to offer to remove their shoes on entering people&rsquo;s homes as some religions frown upon shoes being worn inside the home.</p>
<p>Other handy tips for police include wiping their feet to get rid of mud when entering a gypsy&rsquo;s trailer and not to put a cup of proffered tea on the floor as this could offend their standards of cleanliness.</p>
<p>The booklet also contains a section on appropriate terms to describe ethnic origin, suggesting &#8216;mixed parentage&rsquo; or &#8216;mixed cultural heritage&rsquo; should be used instead of &#8216;mixed race&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Staff are warned that when speaking to someone from Africa or Asia, they should refer to their specific country rather than the continent as a whole.</p>
<p>The rulebook has been described by Kent Police Federation secretary Peter Harman as a &#8216;useful and educational reference guide to dealing with different communities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But it has angered some rank and file officers who say it is politically correct nonsense.</p>
<p>One officer said: &#8216;Most of us are fully aware of how to treat people from different cultural backgrounds, but being told we can&rsquo;t even ask what their Christian name is just plain ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is what we are brought up with  &mdash;  Christian name and surname  &mdash;  and to be honest if you had an officer ask for your personal name and family name it&rsquo;s just going to confuse people.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s just the latest in a long line of annoying PC-related nonsense that we keep getting shoved down our throats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It follows a raft of PC directives from other forces.</p>
<p>Last year officers in Warwickshire were told not to say &#8216;Evenin&rsquo; all&rsquo;  &mdash;  a phrase made famous by classic police drama Dixon of Dock Green  &mdash;  because times of day could meant different things to various cultures.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard recently instructed officers not to use the phrase &#8216;gang rape&rsquo;, because the term was considered too emotive.</p>
<p>Instead they were told to refer to the crime as &#8216;multi-perpetrator rapes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A Freedom of Information request to police forces and fire services has also revealed that a number of organisations, including Essex Police and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, instruct staff to avoid the words &#8216;child, youth or youngster&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Addressing someone as a &#8216;girl&rsquo; or a &#8216;boy&rsquo; could have &#8216;connotations of inexperience, impetuosity and unreliability, or even dishonesty&rsquo;, according to official guidance.</p>
<p>The same guide also warns against the phrases &#8216;manning the phones&rsquo;, &#8216;layman&rsquo;s terms&rsquo; and &#8216;the tax man&rsquo;, for &#8216;making women invisible&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Today, Marie Clair, of the Plain English Campaign, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s so sad that rather than using common sense, we are taking away all sense of respect from the way police deal with the public.</p>
<p>&#8216;If people can&rsquo;t be asked for their Christian name as a matter of common courtesy- something we all identify with- then where are we?</p>
<p>&#8216;This sort of politically correct nonsense helps no one.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Kent Police defended the guidelines.</p>
<p>Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge said: &#8216;It is important that Kent Police recognises and values fundamental human rights and provides services that meet the changing and diverse needs of Kent&rsquo;s communities, visitors and our workforce.</p>
<p>&#8216;One of our core values is that we will treat everyone with fairness, respect and dignity.</p>
<p>&#8216;As such we need to ensure officers and staff have an understanding and awareness of some of the faiths and ethnicities found in Kent so that they can engage more sensitively with, and have more confidence in, the various cultural and faith backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8216;In doing so it will help provide the most appropriate and professional services to those people.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always the police who are first trained against us. Then the police chief and important city officials (and at this point they have the most to gain, making themselves look relevant, down and hip) - they are always in &#8216;negotiations with&rsquo; and &#8216;having talks&rsquo;, and they have &#8216;relations&rsquo; with the minority community. I don&rsquo;t recall whites being given these privileges even after violent revolution. </p>
<p>&#8216;Big Brother&rsquo;? Being white is like having a nasty pair of step parents who favor one child quite a bit more than the other&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of thought to figure out which is which. It takes a lot of newspring to cover it up. </p>

		<p>A prime example of how diversity is a weakness, not a strength. Diversity is leading to a lowering of morale and inefficiency in Scotland Yard. The cop and the citizen have much better interaction if they are from the same community of blood. This is considered normal everywhere else except in the Western world during these PC Dark Ages. </p>

		<p>Are the cops supposed to remove their shoes before raiding a Moslem terrorist cell?  Thankfully, most of them will probably ignore all these dizzyingly silly rules.<br>
In Britain, do as the British do.  A good bit of the planet has followed its example, both in language, manners, and customs.  But of course the PC crowd wants to forget that.</p>

<p>Is this a purely British thing? I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever been asked for my &#8220;Christian name&#8221; and I&rsquo;ve lived in several parts of the United States. Until reading this I wouldn&rsquo;t have known if &#8220;Christian name&#8221; referred to my first, middle or last name.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard the term &#8220;Christian name&#8221; for quite a number of years.  In the USA this isn&rsquo;t a common reference - we seem to have left it behind a long time ago.  And, actually, if someone asked me what my Christian name was, I wouldn&rsquo;t know whether to answer with the names my parents gave me at birth or with the name I chose when I was confirmed in the Catholic Church.  I guess if I was a Buddhist I&rsquo;d say I didn&rsquo;t have a Christian name.  But I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s any big deal.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Christian name&#8221; is the common expression in Britain.  That alone makes this change for the benefit of non-Whites unacceptable.  It&rsquo;s groveling to the Reds and their pets.  </p>

<p>I am aware that this has been the custom in Britain  (and Europe). But frankly, I am surprised that it has taken them this long to get around to abolishing it. Such terms were done away with in the USA long, long ago.  So long ago that I can&rsquo;t even remember.  I do recall reading the novel &#8220;Heidi&#8221; as a child.  In it, she was asked for her Christian name  (Adelaide) and I thought it was even then a rather odd question. Odd enough that I&rsquo;ve remembered all these years.  In America, we just didn&rsquo;t call it that.  We&rsquo;ve been &#8220;sensitive&#8221; for a much longer time; Britain is rushing to catch up.</p>
<p>As for calling people &#8220;dear&#8221; or &#8220;love&#8221;, or putting one&rsquo;s arm around strangers&hellip;  well, that&rsquo;s just common sense that an officer shouldn&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s unprofessional.</p>

		<p>The Kent Constabulary in common with regional police forces across the UK  now forms part of the uniformed wing of Nu-Labour.Its policies are the direct result of its senior officers attending brainwashing &#8220;Leadership&#8221; courses devised by the sinister Common Purpose organisation,which has been instrumental in undermining all of the major institutions in Britain.Its brief extends beyond the obvious imposition of lunatic political correctness to the wholesale deconstruction of the relationship between the public and the newly politicised state operatives that now pass for Police Officers.Cosy familiarity,once a cornerstone of policing in England has no place in the coming totalitarian nightmare.</p>

<p>This phrase in my opinion betrays these new guidelines not as a multiculturalist push but rather an effort by the police state to further drive a wedge between the police forces and the communities in which they operate.  </p>
<p>It makes it easier to run out and cleave someone&rsquo;s skull with a night stick when you don&rsquo;t have a community bond with that person, when you don&rsquo;t live down the street from his grandparents, when you don&rsquo;t have to see his mother in church. </p>

If this country survives the extra cost, the extra crime, the extra time, &amp; the extra effort all demanded of whites in society to promote diversity, then this promised enrichment must be downright GLORIOUS.</p>

		<p>When I lived in Spain many years ago your first name was your Christian name and your last name was, well, your last name. Your first name was your Christian name because children were named after the Saints. As a matter of fact, your Saint&rsquo;s day was more important than your birthday. </p>
<p>When I was a child here in the U.S. going to Catholic school the nuns were quite upset that my first name was not that of a Saint, so they called me by middle name which is Ann. (My father was a Catholic, but my mother was a nomimal Protestant who was really an atheist. She&rsquo;s the one who named me and it&rsquo;s not Varina.)  </p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know how things are in Spain now, but maybe I don&rsquo;t want to know.    </p>

<p>Ha! Perfect observation.<br>
I&rsquo;d really love   &mdash;   if it were possible for some accountant to do   &mdash;   to see a comprehensive profit/loss sheet totalling up all the costs vs. the benefits of Diversity.  Of course, we&rsquo;d never be allowed to see it, because I&rsquo;m sure it would look disastrous.</p>
<p>The fact is, we&rsquo;re dealing here with a kind of &#8220;religious&#8221; principle, an article of faith, that does not have to be justified. It is not a business proposition, and no matter what the cost,  the fanatics are determined to impose it ANYWAY. </p>

		<p>Sheesh! Are there any English policemen left in Kent?<br>
I won&rsquo;t say too much, as what else needs to be said&hellip;but:</p>
<p>&#8220;In it, officers are told to offer to remove their shoes on entering people&rsquo;s homes as some religions frown upon shoes being worn inside the home.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice, but what if the officer has to bolt out the door in a hurry&hellip;he (or she - don&rsquo;t forget) may just get shot attempting to put their shoes back on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other handy tips for police include wiping their feet to get rid of when entering a gypsy&rsquo;s trailer&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t people do that anyway? And why a &#8220;gypsy&rsquo;s trailer&#8221; as opposed to a nice old lady&rsquo;s home? Handy hint? There&rsquo;s probably a manual telling police officers that they have to wash their hands after going to the toilet, or before having lunch&hellip;especially whilst in a &#8220;gypsy&rsquo;s trailer&#8221;.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t ridiculous enough, here&rsquo;s a stranger one:</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year officers in Warwickshire were told not to say &lsquo;Evenin&rsquo; all&rsquo; &mdash; a phrase made famous by classic police drama Dixon of Dock Green &mdash; because times of day could meant different things to various cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even when it just may be &#8220;evening&#8221;.<br>
Good luck to the remaining sensible people in England. I mean it.<br>

		<p>[In Spain], your first name was your Christian name because children were named after the Saints. When I was a child here in the U.S. going to Catholic school, the nuns were quite upset that my first name was not that of a Saint, so they called me by middle name which is Ann.&#8221;   &mdash;  - Varina</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s very interesting!  When I was born, my mother (a Catholic)  wanted to name me &#8220;Harry&#8221; (after my father, a Protestant).  The priest would not allow it!  He maintained that Harry was not a name, but only a nickname for Henry or Harold. You had to be named for a saint.  There was no saint named Harry. So my mother named me for my grandfather instead, and gave me Henry for a middle name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s back when the Church was much stricter about these things (and I wish they were still were).  They would NEVER have allowed such made-up  &#8220;nonsense names&#8221;  as Laqueesha or Shawntavious.  This is one more thing (as with so many examples throughout our culture) where the Church has backed down and lowered its standards to accommodate the blacks.</p>

		<p>I just spoke to someone and mentioned their &#8216;christian name&rsquo;. They had no clue what that was. </p>
<p>So, considering the demise of Christianity in the U.S., I think we have a non-issue with that happening here.</p>
