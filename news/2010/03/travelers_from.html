<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6234BU20100304">Travelers From Haiti Bringing Malaria to U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Health experts watching for signs of a malaria outbreak have noticed several cases of the mosquito-borne disease among people traveling back from Haiti, where an earthquake in January killed as many as 300,000 people.</p>
<p>So far, 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of malaria have been reported among emergency responders and those traveling in the United States from Haiti, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Haiti already had a problem with malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes that will have more places to breed in the cities and towns wrecked by the giant quake.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Each year, Haiti reports about 30,000 confirmed cases of malaria to the Pan American Health Organization, but the CDC estimates as many as 200,000 may occur each year.</p>
<p>Three cases the CDC cited occurred among Haitian residents traveling to the United States and one case involved a U.S. resident who was visiting Haiti. All are expected to recover fully.</p>

		<p>Years ago my lab detected two positive malaria cases at a local immigrant detention center full of Haitians. The CDC recomended that we screen at least 50 haitians for malaria in order to rule out that the disease was contracted locally. Guess what since then we had a few isolated cases that were unexplained.</p>

		<p> Since the earthquake we&rsquo;ve given Haiti huge amounts of money, thousands of hours of our labor and expertise, medical treatment, food, etc., etc., and what have they given us in return? Malaria.</p>
<p> I think it&rsquo;s interesting that while the quake that hit Chile was almost ten times as severe as the one that struck Haiti, the Chileans have dealt with theirs manfully   &mdash;   albeit with considerable help from the outside, which will only last until they get back on their feet again.</p>
<p> Haiti, on the other hand, has never been on its feet in 204 years of (alleged) independence. Being rescued and taken care of is just another day for the Haitians. Much like the inhabitants of most of our inner cities. </p>

		<p>Off topic here for a moment but I am sitting, watching CNN relate the Pentagon shooter story. A man who, days ago had no criminal record has suddenly been found to have drug associations, growing marijuana and other troubles with the law. This &#8220;revelation&#8221; of legal transgressions brings to mind Arnold Schwartzenegger&rsquo;s movie &#8220;the Runnning Man&#8221;, if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie you know what I refer to and if not, get it and watch it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure the American taxpayers will be dragooned into trying to fix this mess too. </p>
<p>To echo Wayne Engle #2, Chile had a much worse quake and is receiving help from the outside. However, that help will be put to good use and they will be back up and running pretty soon. Who knows how long it will take in Haiti, especially of the local populace loots are the stuff we send them. I don&rsquo;t believe we will see any &#8220;We are the World&#8221; moments for Chile. However, from what I have seen, Chile seems to be a pretty well run country. The government and business leaders are mostly white, probably of Castillian Spanish ancestry, but still white. If one wished to &#8220;Go John Galt&#8221;, I wonder if Chile is a good option?</p>
<p>Malaria is probably just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems with Haiti for years down the road. </p>

		<p>In the summer months, prior to the widespread use of DDT and other insecticides, malaria could be found as far north as St. Louis, traveling right up the Mississippi! NO malaria in the western hemisphere prior to the coming of whitey either.</p>
<p>About one persons in three that HAVE EVER LIVED have died from malaria or the side effects thereof. Bad stuff.</p>

		<p>My family is from south Georgia and my grandfather who grew up in the 1920s told me that when he was a boy his ears used to ring all the time because of the quinine that he took for malaria.   We got rid of malaria in the southern United States through a very intensive campaign of spraying DDT and oil over wet ares and draining some areas to reduce the breeding ground for mosquitoes.  The point is that we suffered from malaria right here at home in the United Stated for hundreds of years but through the application of science backed by an educated and civil society we eradicated the disease.   Once more multiculturalism and open borders drags our society backwards into the past.</p>

<p>I lived in Chile for 11 months in 2009 and was pretty impressed with what I saw.<br>
They are very White Hispanics (I really couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference between one of my roommates and what I would know as a White American), and have a great degree of national solidarity.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very impressed with how they are handling this horrific earthquake situation.  There is a very strong contrast between Chile and Haiti that, predictably, the media has chosen to almost completely ignore.  </p>
<p>While I did come across some crime in Santiago, the capital city, it didn&rsquo;t distract me from the positive trends I saw.  Their violent crime rate is 3 times lower than we have here in the US anyway (although we all know why its so high here). The Chilean system is very free-market, and will only become more so with the election of billionaire Pinera.  They have very low immigration (though their immigration policies are currently terrible), mostly because of their isolated geographical location between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes Mountains.  Their biggest threat are the darker-skinned Peruvians, who take a lot of their menial jobs.  Other than those coming from Peru, Chile sees very little immigration.  They simply don&rsquo;t know much about outsiders, other than what they see on TV. </p>
<p>All-in-all, outside of the predominantly Caucasian English-speaking, and other Western Euro nations, which we all know are really losing ground fast to immigrants, I think Chile holds a great deal of intrigue to WN&rsquo;s like ourselves.  It will be interesting to see how they fare in continuing to rebuild from the quake, and hopefully continue to advance their solid free-market economy afterwards.</p>

		<p>It is interesting to note that the &#8220;whiter&#8221; or more European a South American nation is the more civilized it is.  Now why is that?  The western hemisphere is a great experiment in diversity.  If we were to measure the amount of European, African and Amerindian genetic material contributed to a nations overall population and then compare that to the nations  political stability, crime rate, poverty rate and overall economic and technical advancement I wonder what the results would show?  Hmmmmmmmmm.<br>

		<p>Just wanted to throw in my two cents worth about Chile. I used to travel to Chile on business. I loved it. The first time I saw Santiago I thought I was back in Madrid, very European. The people are very polite, the way they used to be here in the U.S. back when. It&rsquo;s too late for me, but if I were younger I would definitely consider moving there.  </p>

<i> &ldquo;If one wished to &ldquo;Go John Galt&rdquo;, I wonder if Chile is a good option?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>To answer your question, I would say yes.  I fully endorse everything Gen.Lee said.  Chile is not entirely white, but it is now at least a whiter nation than we are.   Think of Chile as California with the seasons reversed.  But without the blacks and the self-destructive, white-hating, minority-loving, multi-cultural illness that has gripped the USA in recent decades.   It&rsquo;s not paradise and it&rsquo;s not without problems, but it&rsquo;s better than a lot of the USA is now, or even some of Europe.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly.  Yes, the media  have noticed and commented on everything  except the most glaring difference,  which is race.    Incidentally, Chileans are known as  &#8220;the Anglo-Saxons of South America&#8221;.   They have won all their wars, and they get things done.  Nor are they all &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;   &mdash;   there has been a lot of European immigration to Chile, which is evident in the faces of the people. President Bachelet, for instance, is of French descent, as was Pinochet before her.</p>

		<p>Malaria? </p>
<p>Haiti is where AIDS came from in the early 80s after it was transferred from Africa by migrants who moved from the west coast to the VooDoo capital of the west also in Miami and New Orleans oddly hit with big hurricanes and floods too. <br>
It is estimated 50% of Haiti had HIV or AIDS. </p>
<p>And you must question the 250k dead in Haiti since that was 7.0 quake and the Chile quake was 1000 times more powerful at 8.8 yet only 250 died. Conception Chile has 2 million in the general area exposed to the quake like Port Au Prince.<br>
Haiti needed big numbers for more aid and the SE tsunami in 2004 had 250k dead supposedly although nobody counted like in Haiti.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Chile three times and think it is a decent enough place, but the average Chilean is not white/European.  They have a very significant amount of Indian blood in them which varies directly with the social class.  Argentina, especially Buenos Aires, has a much more Caucasian population.</p>

		<p>Thanks Fritz for your more accurate input.</p>
<p>I have not been to Chile but I have looked at dozens of photos from the earthquake.  It seems very obvious to me that at least 3 in 4 people in that country are mestizo and the purely white type of physical appearance is rare.  </p>

<p>More accurate input?? Like I said, I LIVED in Chile for 11 months last year.  There is no need to insult my judgment.  I don&rsquo;t know when the last time Old Fritzy was there (or for how long), but I doubt he has as accurate a picture of the situation as I.  I visited about 2/3 of the country, from Arica down to Chiloe, and they are a very White population in Chile.  The darker-skinned folks that we would normally associate with Spanish-speaking peoples are the exception rather than the rule.  Yes, most of them still do look somewhat Latino, but very very White comparatively speaking.  Like ghw said, Chileans are known as the Anglo-Saxons of South America.  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s obvious that Fritz hasn&rsquo;t been to Buenos Aires anytime recently, otherwise he would have noted the increasing presence of very dark-skinned migrants that line the streets there.  I saw maybe 5 dark-skinned people the entire year in Santiago.  Thanks.</p>
