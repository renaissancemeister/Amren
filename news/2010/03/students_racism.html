<h1>Students: Racism Less Blatant, But Still There</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Shearer, Athens Banner-Herald, February 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly half a century after a federal judge forced the University of Georgia to admit black students, race still is an issue at UGA, students on campus say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UGA still has a predominantly white student body, even though the number of blacks and other minority students has climbed dramatically in the past five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being black,&#8221; said second-year student Shandrea Hardeman.</p>
<p>And sometimes, when she sees students cross to the other side of the street to avoid her, she thinks it&rsquo;s probably because she&rsquo;s black. But those incidents are rare, and when students do encounter racism these days, it&rsquo;s more hidden, they say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never experienced blatant, hateful racism on campus,&#8221; said Josh Delaney, president of the university&rsquo;s Black Student Union.</p>
<p>But Delaney and other black students still feel the sting of racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&rsquo;m walking down the street and someone passes by and moves way out of my way, I tend to think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m black,&#8221; Hardeman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even though legal segregation is gone, other kinds of segregation and discrimination remain, students said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s different races here, but everybody stays within their same groups, for the most part,&#8221; said UGA library worker and recent UGA graduate Ambre Reed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s always seemed to be somewhat of a divide at the University of Georgia between, this is what the white students do and this what the black students do, and it was kind of an unspoken thing,&#8221; said Warren [UGA graduate Will Warren, an alumni member of historically black Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity], who is white. &#8220;But why is it that way, and should it be that way in 2010?&#8221;</p>
<p>Black students still can feel shut out, said Rodd Cargill, vice president of the UGA Phi Beta Sigma chapter.</p>
<p>But students are not segregating themselves because of outright racism, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want to fall into their comfort zone, and not really give people a fair chance. It&rsquo;s both sides,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Even when black students are invited to join majority-white groups, minority students may wonder why.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels sometimes like a token. You feel like they want to reach a certain quota. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a conscious thing,&#8221; said junior LeMona Wyatt, a vice president of the Black Student Union.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of diversity events, but they&rsquo;re more geared toward minorities,&#8221; Reed said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You end up talking to a bunch of black people about being black,&#8221; Hardeman said.</p>

		<p>I was watching the band R.E.M. on PBS the other night. They got their start as students in Athens around 1980 or so. The band is well know for liberal activism, especially on the part of their singer Michael Stipe. Admittedly a very talented band, I couldn&rsquo;t help while watching but wonder if they grasp the irony of being kicked out of mainstream music media in the mid-90s at their peak popularity as a white rock band in favor of the media carpet bombing of untaltented black rap and hip-hop hacks. Their pet causes were more centered around the environment and homosexuality but I can guarantee you they are also race liberals as well. It well never dawn on the liberals that their insistance on the &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; of blacks inevitably leads to a black takeover and shutting themselves out of the very opportunities the give to blacks.</p>

		<p>Walking around the University of Minnesota campus just two days ago the contrast between black and white students could not be more stark. The black students seemed lethargic, shuffling around slowly with oversized hooded sthletic sweatshirts, giant black headphones covering their ears, backpacks on with hands in their pockets, an unfocused, almost &#8216;lost&rsquo; or vacant expression on their faces, in absolutely no hurry to get where they were going, if they even had a place to be going you could not tell. </p>
<p>The white students walked around at a brisk pace, small iPod buds in their ears but still focused or tuned in to their surroundings, making at least some eye contact with passers-by, they tended to have books in hand, or in bag over one shoulder, some looked traditional, some alternative, but none looked clueless like the black students. I&rsquo;m sure a good portion of the white students fall for the diversity claptrap presented in class but to an outside observer it is easy to tell who belongs there and who is wasting their time (and others&rsquo; money).   </p>

<p>White Eve Carson was from Athens. She is buried there right now after having been kidnapped, robbed, and shot five times by two privileged afrovoodoo thugs, neither of whom have been charged with an hate crime against a white girl, and one of whom was supposed to be in jail at the time. His affirmative action diversity parole officer must have decided he could better serve the &#8220;community&#8221; while out of jail instead of in jail. Now the white race has lost another fine specimen of its greatest potential to  uncontrollable afrovoodoo hatred and race violence.  </p>
<p>We now announce the Eve Carson Memorial Racial Identity Award to Shandrea Hardeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being black,&rdquo; said second-year student Shandrea Hardeman.</p>
<p>Dear Shandrea, </p>
<p>In recognition of your example of pure racial consciousness, we announce you as the winner of the Eve Carson Memorial Racial Identity Award. We apologized for not making the announcement during Black History Month. If you will please keep talking like you have been, we feel confident that you will say something to merit your receiving another ECMRIA.</p>
<p>We praise, honor, and encourage you for making this statement: &#8220;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being black.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We agree. Everyone should be conscious of their race, ALWAYS!</p>
<p>Through your example, we encourage all white students to speak the name Eve Carson and  then repeat &#8220;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being white.&#8221;</p>
<p>We only wish Eve Carson had been more conscious of her whiteness and stunning beauty that made her a target for privileged afrovoodoo thugs who targeted her splendid whiteness for kidnapping, robbing, and murdering. We wish she had been more realistic about the threats surrounding her. In so doing, we acknowledge the pain of her loss as a warning to us all, and therefore, in her name and in your honor, we hereby repeat and pledge to the womb of our own White Mothers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being white.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Congratulations, Shandrea!</p>
<p>Awarded this First Day of March, the Day after Black History Month, in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Ten, in the Second Year of the Historic First Afrovoodoo Presidency of Our Country, by the White Consciousness Committee</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always conscious of being black,&rdquo; said second-year student Shandrea Hardeman.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Most blacks are, and very conspicuously so.  Whites, however, who are conscious of being <i>White</i> are called &#8220;Racists.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;I have never experienced blatant, hateful racism on campus,&rdquo; said Josh Delaney, president of the university&rsquo;s Black Student Union.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Then&hellip;what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m walking down the street and someone passes by and moves way out of my way,<b>I tend to think</b> it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m black,&rdquo; Hardeman said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So then&hellip;it&rsquo;s in your own perceptions?  No one has slighted you in any way, but since <i>you tend to think</i> they are, the cause can only be Racism?</p>
<p>Paranoia strikes deep.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always seemed to be somewhat of a divide at the University of Georgia between, this is what the white students do and this what the black students do, and it was kind of an unspoken thing,&rdquo; said Warren [UGA graduate Will Warren, an alumni member of historically black Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity], who is white. &ldquo;But why is it that way, and should it be that way in 2010?&rdquo;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Er&hellip;because students of both races like it that way?  Maybe you should ask the members of one of the &#8220;historically White&#8221; fraternities what they think.  Oh, wait&hellip;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But students are not segregating themselves because of outright racism, he said.</i></p>
<p>Once again then: what is the problem? </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Even when black students are invited to join majority-white groups, minority students may wonder why.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>White people sometimes wonder the same thing, but when they do, they&rsquo;re called &#8220;Racists.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;It feels sometimes like a token. You feel like they want to reach a certain quota.&#8221;&#8220;</i></p>
<p>You are correct, LeMona.  That is <i>exactly</i> what they want.  And woe betide any Whites who fail to achieve that quota.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;We have a lot of diversity events, but they&rsquo;re more geared toward minorities,&rdquo; Reed said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Is that not the very definition of &#8220;diversity events?&#8221;  How well do you think a <i>White</i> event would go over at your campus?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;You end up talking to a bunch of black people about being black,&rdquo; Hardeman said.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>At least you have that privilege.  When White people talk to other White people about being White, it&rsquo;s called &#8220;Hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, when you boil this &#8220;news&#8221; item down to its basics, what you get is a handful of black students complaining that even though they have experienced no Racism and White people are doing all that has been demanded of them, Racism must <i>still</i> somehow be a terrible problem.</p>
<p>No matter how much we give in to their demands, it is never enough.</p>

		<p> As is the norm with such stories appearing under the by-lines of politically correct reporters of our era, there is never a suggestion, not a hint, that all this &#8220;reaching out&#8221; and &#8220;getting out of your comfort zone&#8221; the students talk about is anything but 110 percent right and proper. Why, they imply, &#8220;diversity&#8221; is the natural condition of man, if only Nasty Old White Racism didn&rsquo;t get in the way. What a crock!</p>
<p> For one thing, what&rsquo;s wrong with a comfort zone? Should we all be seeking &#8220;discomfort zones&#8221;? As to blacks wondering if they were being invited to join organizations as a &#8220;token,&#8221; well, we know what they would scream if they WEREN&rsquo;T invited, now don&rsquo;t we? The Left likes to talk about &#8220;unexamined assumptions&#8221; in this society, implying that all of them are held by conservatives and White people. Well, there are a number of &#8220;unexamined assumptions&#8221; of the &#8220;everyone knows that&#8221; category voiced in this article.</p>
<p> Doesn&rsquo;t it ever occur to an editor to say to such a reporter, &#8220;Did it ever occur to you to also talk to a few people who DON&rsquo;T like all this diversity, just to make your story more balanced?&#8221; Apparently not. </p>

		<p>It goes to show you; if blacks can&rsquo;t find something to complain about, they still complain. Move out there way, and they &#8220;feel the sting.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t move out the way, and you&rsquo;re disrespecting them. Invite them to something and they &#8220;feel like a token.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t invite them and its an act of arpartheid and racism.  All blacks ever seem to talk about is being black.    </p>

Mr Hardeman, I suggest that you discuss this with the Reverend Jesse Jackson who said the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved. How humiliating.&#8221; </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing how blacks that are members of the &#8220;BLACK&#8221; student union can complain about being &#8220;shut out&#8221;and &#8220;segregated&#8221; by Whites. </p>

		<p>In other words, racism doesn&rsquo;t actually have to occur, blacks just need to perceive someone is being racist against them for there to be a &#8220;problem with racism.&#8221; Whites are believed racist until proven otherwise, but the thing is, you cannot prove the non-existence of something, in this case, the non-existence of racist feelings. As long as blacks carry a chip on their shoulder that all whites are out to get them, there will always be perceived racism to blacks. </p>

		<p>I looked at Shandrea&rsquo;s picture and was immediately struck by the fact that this black woman who is ALWAYS conscious of her blackness straightens the kinky wool on her head to make it look like real hair.  As a white with real hair, I am offended by that. She hides here true blackness from us. Blackness is the proper combination of afro skin and afro wool.</p>
<p>We demand that blacks let their wool grow out all wild and nappy and be AUTHENTICALLY AFRICAN and stop trying to ACT WHITE!  </p>
<p>We are offended when we see our First Lady Obama, who looks FULLY AFRICAN in the face, straighten her kinky wool while trying to act white.  We want here authentic, not fake.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/>
Yes, they do have that privilege and many more. They are privileged in ways of free association and speech that whites are not, but the injustice of it all has piled up high enough and the dam seems near breaking.   We approach our Victory Day.</p>
<p>Please repeat over and over:  When we whites try enjoying the same race privileges of free association and speech that we&rsquo;ve given to blacks, we are accused of &#8220;RACISM&#8221; and &#8220;HATE&#8221;. </p>
<p>It is a matter of privilege. What blacks do in the normal course of experiencing their racial reality, we can&rsquo;t do because of the splc, adl, naacp and hate laws.</p>
<p>We have given blacks the institutionalized privilege to destroy our civilization, and we&rsquo;ve taken away our organized privilege of complaining about it.</p>
<p>White people disgust me. So full of genius potential, but incapacitated by intimidation and evangelism.</p>

<p>Could it be because they are polite, rather than racist?  Could it be that if you are like most black people, you have ZERO intention of walking down a street the normal way, stepping to let other pedestrians  pass?  Could it be, that like pretty much all other blacks, you go barreling down the sidewalk daring glaring and daring whitey to not move aside for your highness?</p>

		<p>Of course integration is simply wonderful! I mean look at the manifold benefits. Exposure to different &#8220;culture&#8221;, you learn quickly how best to protect yourself from crime. A whole new &#8220;language&#8221;, composed mainly of grunts and clicks. You even learn to develop a new taste in fashions&hellip; so you can dress yourself to look like a circus freak or a refugee from the nearest insane asylum.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s racism for a white person to move out of your way, but purely not at all when a large group of black guys attack a lone white man and kill him?  If he&rsquo;s lucky, all the black guys might do is just beat him up badly.  The whining and hypocrisy when it comes to blacks and racism knows no limits.</p>

		<p>If you notice or mention somebody is black you are a racist for noticing it. However if you don&rsquo;t notice it or mention it you will be reminded of it and have it shoved down your throat. Same thing with hispanic&rsquo;s. Having known quite a few hispanic&rsquo;s for  year&rsquo;s and really liking some of them it is amazing to me that their ethnicity is always on their mind&rsquo;s and they constantly bring it up no matter what the topic of conversation. So what is racist noticing somebody&rsquo;s race or not noticing it? Can&rsquo;t have it both way&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Even when black students are invited to join majority-white groups, minority students may wonder why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels sometimes like a token. You feel like they want to reach a certain quota. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a conscious thing,&rdquo; said junior LeMona Wyatt, a vice president of the Black Student Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if it even occurs to people like LeMona that their very presence at the university is to &#8220;reach a certain quota&#8221;.  I wonder if it even occurs to them that affirmative action policies are the source of everything they&rsquo;re complaining about.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called &#8220;freedom of association.&#8221; What&rsquo;s so hard to understand about it? We DO NOT HAVE TO associate or fraternize with those we prefer to have at most minimal contact with. I admit I have no desire to have Blacks or Latino immigrants for friends. Our values and thinking are simply too far apart. My awareness from numerous sources that Blacks and Latinos commit by far the most crimes in our society simply adds to my desire to avoid them.</p>

		<p>I was on one of those segregated campuses and was unfortunately on the black side of the fence.  It was hell.  My so-called friends were always fighting and they would say very mean things to me.  There was a cult of blackness, with forums on black love, black health, and black spirituality.  Students would protest over insanely trivial matters.  The African-American studies courses were junk courses where people played victim.  Black Americans are whiners who will never let this race issue die down.  If I had to do it over again, I would have only hung out with whites.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll clear up any misconception you might have about us Whites.</p>
<p>As a white female with a beautiful blond 19-year old daughter, if I see blacks, I immediately cross the street, lock my car doors, avoid your sections of town, and warn my children about you continually. </p>
<p>I have very good reason for doing this.</p>
<p>The vast numbers of your criminal brethren have made it so and as much as you may deny it, the msm ignore it or downplay black-on-White murders, FBI and Justice Department statistics don&rsquo;t lie.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather you call me a White Racist to my face then sit in court, sobbing my eyes out like Eve Carson&rsquo;s loved ones, or lie in a plot in the earth than extend you any benefit of doubt. </p>
<p>According to the Color of Crime:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;A black is about 39 times more likely to do violence to a white than the other way around, and no less than 130 times more likely to rob a white.</p>
<p>Every year there are about 15,000 black-on-white rapes but fewer than 900 white-on-black rapes. There are more than 3,000 gang rapes of whites by blacks &mdash; but white-on-black gang rapes are so rare they do not even show up in the statistics.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 770,000 violent interracial crimes committed every year involving blacks and whites, blacks commit 85 percent and whites commit 15 percent.<br/>
Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks and against other blacks.</p>
<p>Blacks are seven times more likely to be in prison than whites. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/d853ff" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/d853ff</a></p>
<p>Knowing these statistics as I do, and I have not seen them disproved, it is in my best interest to keep myself and my loved ones safe from harm  &mdash;  and this means avoiding blacks at all costs least I end up as a victim of one.</p>
<p>I would suggest every White do the same, spread the word, and share these statistics with their school-brainwashed children and other loved ones.  We already know the USG will not protect us so we must protect ourselves.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like it, Mr. Hardeman, why don&rsquo;t you, as a black concerned about &#8216;White tendencies&rsquo;, work on lowering black-on-White crime.</p>

		<p>First of all, socializing with like kinds is not racism; it&rsquo;s human nature. And if it WAS racism,  wouldn&rsquo;t  blacks preferring to socialize with blacks  be just as racist  as whites preferring to socialize with whites&rsquo;? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 15 minutes from this campus. It&rsquo;s no different than any other college campus. In general, students prefer their own kind. Yes, it&rsquo;s still that way in 2010 because that&rsquo;s the way people want it. If they didn&rsquo;t it wouldn&rsquo;t be. And black students still whine about racism because that&rsquo;s what THEY want.</p>

		<p>How dare white people prefer white company. There has got to be a heavy tax levied against white people that reproduce with other whites. As well tax write offs and grants for participants in miscegination between blacks and whites. Eventually the white race must be eliminated from the human specie so others will not be offended by the realization of not being white.</p>

<p>May all White praises from Heaven come down and bless you, your family and home! Teaching your white daughter about afrothug dangers is the greatest gift of love that you can bestow upon her.  May God protect her from the wily Satan who constantly speaks to her against you through the lies of Diversity Mandates and global familialism. Satan constantly approaches her with shame of her white privilege, which is shame against her white mother who loves her and defends here from afrovoodoo robbing, raping, and murdering.</p>
<p>My own dear and blessed white mother would lock the car doors anytime she saw a black standing on the side of the road, and still does. I do it habitually now, and I think of her every time, and I praise God for her, her beautiful white skin, and her natural white love for her white children.  </p>
<p>Your daughter has the best of what a mother can be. Helping her accumulate and foster her prejudices and racial awareness will be repaid to you in beautiful white grandchildren.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind words.</p>
<p>Your sentiment and  #31s moved my cold, rational Anglo-Saxon/Germanic heart to near tears.</p>
<p>All day the news around here has been about 17-year old Chelsea King who was murdered by a monster that should HAVE NEVER been let out of prison, ever.  His own psychiatrist recommended that he be locked away for the maximum allowed years, but this monster was let out to kill a beautiful blond high school senior.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;It is my opinion that [the defendant would be a continued danger to underage [girls] in the community,&#8221; Dr. Matthew Carroll wrote in a report&hellip;.It is unlikely the defendant would be amenable to treatment&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I saw her picture, I saw my daughter and all of her friends.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t think I could stand it if I were Chelsea&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>The killer is White and that is why there is all the hoopla about her killing.  When Lilly Burke&rsquo;s killer turned out to be black, the story was squelched  &mdash;  I live in the local area and there was immediate media silence once the killer&rsquo;s race was revealed.</p>
<p>Imagine that.</p>
<p>The LA Times has printed 14 articles on the &#8216;outrage at UCSD&rsquo; (over a ghetto themed party) but black-on-White murders?  You&rsquo;ll be lucky if they&rsquo;re even mentioned on the bottom of page 14.</p>
<p>James Edwards reports the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Akron blacks like to drive over to Kent State University and beat white college students for fun. In January, John White&rsquo;s number came up. He was savagely beaten on January 23rd, and finally died from his injuries a few days ago. John White is the second white KSU student beaten to death by Akron blacks in the past few months. Two Crackron thugs beat Christopher Kernich to death back in November. </p>
<p>The administration (of UCSD) held emergency meetings with black students, and caved in to one demand after another from the blacks on campus wailing about how they don&rsquo;t feel safe on campus. They even promised the blacks that private parties that they don&rsquo;t approve of will no longer be tolerated. But four white students attacked in three months by blacks, and two of them dying, and the university and media are completely silent&hellip;&#8221;</p>
