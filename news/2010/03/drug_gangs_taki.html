<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35650016/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Drug Gangs Taking Over U.S. Public Lands</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, March 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Not far from Yosemite&rsquo;s waterfalls and in the middle of California&rsquo;s redwood forests, Mexican drug gangs are quietly commandeering U.S. public land to grow millions of marijuana plants and using smuggled immigrants to cultivate them.</p>
<p>Pot has been grown on public lands for decades, but Mexican traffickers have taken it to a whole new level: using armed guards and trip wires to safeguard sprawling plots that in some cases contain tens of thousands of plants offering a potential yield of more than 30 tons of pot a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like the Mexicans took over the methamphetamine trade, they&rsquo;ve gone to mega, monster gardens,&#8221; said Brent Wood, a supervisor for the California Department of Justice&rsquo;s Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement. He said Mexican traffickers have &#8220;supersized&#8221; the marijuana trade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Less risky and expensive</b></p>
<p>In 2008 alone, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, police across the country confiscated or destroyed 7.6 million plants from about 20,000 outdoor plots.</p>
<p>Growing marijuana in the U.S. saves traffickers the risk and expense of smuggling their product across the border and allows gangs to produce their crops closer to local markets.</p>
<p>Distribution also becomes less risky. Once the marijuana is harvested and dried on the hidden farms, drug gangs can drive it to major cities, where it is distributed to street dealers and sold along with pot that was grown in Mexico.</p>
<p>About the only risk to the Mexican growers, experts say, is that a stray hiker or hunter could stumble onto a hidden field.</p>
<p>The remote plots are nestled under the cover of thick forest canopies in places such as Sequoia National Park, or hidden high in the rugged-yet-fertile Sierra Nevada Mountains. Others are secretly planted on remote stretches of Texas ranch land.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Protected by explosives, guards</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if they had the manpower to police the vast wilderness, authorities say terrain and weather conditions often keep them from finding the farms, except accidentally.</p>
<p>Many of the plots are encircled with crude explosives and are patrolled by guards armed with AK-47s who survey the perimeter from the ground and from perches high in the trees.</p>
<p>The farms are growing in sophistication and are increasingly cultivated by illegal immigrants, many of whom have been brought to the U.S. from Michoacan.</p>
<p>Growers once slept among their plants, but many of them now have campsites up to a mile away equipped with separate living and cooking areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Drug gangs have also imported marijuana experts and unskilled labor to help find the best land or build irrigation systems, Wood said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Agents find remnants of camp life</b></p>
<p>When the harvest is complete, investigators say, pot farm workers haul the product in garbage bags to dropoff points that are usually the same places where they get resupplied with food and fuel.</p>
<p>Agents routinely find the discarded remnants of camp life when they discover marijuana fields. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to discover pots and pans, playing cards and books, half-eaten bags of food, and empty beer cans and liquor bottles.</p>
<p>But the growers leave more than litter to worry about. They often use animal poisons that can pollute mountain streams and groundwater meant for legitimate farmers and ranchers.</p>
<p>Because of the tree cover, armed pot farmers can often take aim at law enforcement before agents ever see them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Traffickers are diversifying</b></p>
<p>Vast amounts of pot are still smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico. Federal officials report nearly daily hauls of several hundred to several thousand pounds seized along the border. But drug agents say the boom in domestic growing is a sign of diversification by traffickers.</p>

		<p>The war on drugs was lost a long time ago.  Fighting further only strengthens the cartels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for legalization.  Upon taking the crime out of drugs, the feds are going to find that a whole slew of their problems are going to be miraculously solved.</p>
<p>Probably California will be the first to legalize, sell and tax controlled substances, and it will come about in an effort to fight off uncontrolled crime and another trip to the economic abyss.  Like alcohol it will be done to stop the explosion of crime.  And, like gambling, it will be done to fill the king&rsquo;s coffers with tax revenue.</p>

		<p>If only the U.S. would cease its insane War on Some Drugs, problems like these would gradually go away.  I&rsquo;m wondering how many innocent hikers have been shot, raped or beaten up by those pot farmers simply because they unknowingly strayed too close to such a farm.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, and I&rsquo;ll say it again: Legalize domestic production of marijuana by individual citizens and thus cut off the supply of money to the foreign drug operations.  Don&rsquo;t tax it (making it as cheap as possible), at least until the money for the foreigners has dried up.</p>

<p>The risk is NOT to the Mex grower, the risk is to the HIKER! You will be shot on sight. And then your remains disposed of in a less than genial and respectful manner.</p>
<p>And people only now realizing this is a problem are far behind the curve. By the time the average citizen understands this is a problem the problem has been around for some time unseen.</p>
<p>And this used to be a cottage industry for hippie type older white folks and is now a mega industry for illegal aliens and mex gangsters.</p>
<p>Another American industry falls to foreign competition.</p>

		<p>This whole issue,in my opinion,should not ONLY be a question of how to stop illegal drugs. To me that&rsquo;s the least of it. Instead, this issue, in my opinion, should be one of wiping out, eliminating, destroying, and annihilating foreign influence and tampering on U.S. soil, by citizens of one of the most corrupt nations in the world. It should be SHAMEFULL, absolutely EMBARASSING, that drug dealers, illegally in the U.S. as it is, are actually using this nations precious national forests to grow and sell the drugs that addict American kids. We&rsquo;re always telling the world that we are Number one, numero uno, but what does it mean? HAVE WE NO SELF RESPECT. HAVE WE NO PRIDE. WE HAVE EMPTY BRAVADO. Oh, excuse me, Nancy Reagan said, &#8220;just say no&#8221;. Or how about the constant TV commercials a few years ago, &#8220;Keep your kids off of drugs&#8221;? All of this advice is stupid and empty talk, when talk is as far as it goes. Sorry for ranting, but I still feel the same about this issue as I did when first having read years ago, that our NATIONAL FORESTS are being used by Mexican drug growers. I guess the problem still exists, so utterly unconcerned are our leaders about it. Why? Are they worried about hurting Mexico&rsquo;s feelings if they send the drug growers back in body bags? As one poster always ends, God help us all!!</p>

		<p>This is amazing,here in kentucky every summer you have helicopters, military,police forces searching and harasing people in eastern kentucky weeding out pot plants to a fanatical level.But yet they just can&rsquo;t seem to find the time to go after illegal mexicans doing the same,if hikers can find these patches then why can&rsquo;t the authorities(can you say double standard).The war on drugs is a bad joke and i&rsquo;m not laughing anymore.</p>

		<p>The problem is our addle-brained government officials don&rsquo;t have sense enough to allow sale of drug under government control. Like alcohol. Legalizing and selling narcotics and &#8220;recreational drugs&#8221; under control with the government, rather than the cartels pocketing the profits seems far too sensible for our officials.</p>
<p>Me, I don&rsquo;t use drugs. Never have. Never will. But I&rsquo;d a thousand times rather see drug profits paying down our government&rsquo;s debts rather than letting some damned Mexican drug lord get richer still.</p>

		<p>Is there anyone out there who believes the USG is winning The War On Drugs?</p>
<p>Did alcohol prohibition free us from alcohol?  Hardly.  But when prohibition was lifted, during The Depression, the crime rate dropped and kept dropping for 30 years.</p>
<p>After more than 30 years and trillions of dollars in wasted law enforcement has The Drug War lessened the public demand for illicit drugs?  Has The Drug War made our cities safer?  Free from drugs?  </p>
<p>No, it has tied up law enforcement resources diverting them from violent crime, as broke cities such as LA cut its police forces and governors release violent criminals back onto the streets due to massive prison overcrowding.  The Drug War has giving rise to ever more violent gangs, willing to skirt the law, willing to kill anyone that gets in their way:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Many of the plots are encircled with crude explosives and are patrolled by guards armed with AK-47s&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>The late Libertarian leader Harry Browne wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Drugs Wars have spawned a black market run by criminals. Drugs are sold only by people willing to risk being caught and sent to prison. The business becomes the province of gangsters.</p>
<p>Instead of competing with their rivals by offering superior products, better service, or lower prices, drug dealers compete by gang warfare. And the more the government cracks down on drug operations, the more drug activity is dominated by the most brutal elements of society&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I remember hearing Harry speak of these things on TV and radio  &mdash;  and be immediately dismissed as some kind of a nut, but in all of this, he was the one that had the ONLY rational solution to ending the insanity of the War on Drugs:  Legalize them, all of them, and do it immediately.  I turned off Sean Hannity, permanently, after he called Harry a &#8216;Looney-tarian&rsquo; after Harry had spoken about the drugs wars on Sean&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>No matter how aggressively and oppressively the Drug Warriors fight their war, the drug trade continues unabated.</p>
<p>According to Time Magazine:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Pot is California&rsquo;s biggest cash crop, responsible for $14 billion a year in sales, dwarfing the state&rsquo;s second largest agricultural commodity &mdash; milk and cream &mdash; which brings in $7.3 billion a year, according to the most recent USDA statistics&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What greedy California politician wouldn&rsquo;t love to get his hands on the massive amount of  tax monies that legal pot sales would generate? </p>
<p>The Drug Wars have also eroded our Civil Rights as government runs roughshod over us in the name of fighting what they think is a noble war  &mdash;  but then, maybe that&rsquo;s the point and it isn&rsquo;t about drugs at all.</p>

		<p>The government has recently lifted its ban on firearms in some national parks, though not in all.  It would be nice to carry something in the deep woods for protection, but a small Colt wouldn&rsquo;t do much against automatic weapons.  Be especially careful, too, if you hike in hill country with many springs;  you wouldn&rsquo;t want to stumble on a moonshiner&rsquo;s still.  Yes, legalize.  Heraclitus writes that &#8220;donkeys prefer garbage to gold.&#8221;  Have we not unwisely imprisoned the meek and innocent slain in our vain effort to keep as*es out of the trash?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;illegal&#8221; drugs will NEVER be legalized in the US until a large enough consensus can be built to drag the politicians kicking and screaming to do it. The reason is that way too much money is in keeping drugs &#8220;illegal&#8221; and much of that money goes into those same politicians&rsquo; pockets! DEA keeps the competition in check to help the &#8220;approved&#8221; cartels. the payoffs are huge and the corruption goes to the highest levels. the problem is and has been for a long time international. the problem the US has is that since we are so &#8220;rich&#8221; we are the largest and therefore the most lucrative market. </p>

		<p>This is no surprise. Just as when Alcohol was outlawed, a black market of criminals springs up to fill the demand. Legalize ALL currently illicit drugs. I couldn&rsquo;t care less if some lower form of life wants to ruin his/her life through drug consumption. If they do commit an act of violence under the influence though, punishment should be swift and most severe. And for God&rsquo;s sake, if a person ODs and has to go to the ER, make that person pay. Or kick &#8216;em out in the street. Not my problem&hellip;</p>

		<p>This comment won&rsquo;t be popular here, but here goes. Personal choices made that are harmful to yourself, and especially others, are wrong and should be against the law. There is not a need to create mentally impaired, irresponsible people, to maim, kill, rape, and steal. When these drugs are consumed, there is a snowball effect on all those around the one using them. Drugs are a great price to pay, so that someone who can&rsquo;t deal with reality can escape into la la land. Ah yes, many would have all those things legalized, that they are unable, or unwilling, to do without. What next, murder, rape, theft, or child molestation?</p>

<p>Yes, they are wrong, but the problem with the War on Drugs is that far too many people don&rsquo;t care and just want to get high.  I suspect that this situation is one of the much-touted benefits of diversity.</p>
<p>Since directly fixing diversity is much harder than legalizing drugs, perhaps we should legalize the drugs and let the &#8220;diversity&#8221; types that like to get high do themselves in.</p>

		<p>It is a shame now that I am hesitant to go walking on state park trails for fear of running across a band of illegals with crime on their mind.  Do you want to cure the drug trade?  Convict everyone who uses drugs and instead of jail, give them 2-3 years of community service.  If they fall back into drugs, strip them of their citizenship and deport them to some godforsaken country in the third world that would happily take them in (for a fee of course).  Drug dealers, on the other hand, should be sentenced to LIFE with hard labor and no parole.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new.  When I was a college student at UC Santa Cruz in the mid and late 1980s, there were public woodland areas we knew to stay out of.  The marijuana plantations had everything from armed guards to booby traps - like fish hooks attached at eye level to springy tree branches.</p>

		<p>I do think we should legalize drugs that are not strongly addictive, including marijuana, psilocybin, and mescaline.  I can&rsquo;t see any good reason to waste my tax dollars locking somebody up because he decided to grow some magic mushrooms (which grow all by themselves in farmers&rsquo; fields anyway).  But the criminal gangs would still exist, making highly addictive drugs like methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Criminal Mexican gangs taking over our national parks will not of course cause the Sierra Club to change its view that any reduction of immigration is racist.  The idiots at the Sierra Club continue to complain about every consequence of an ever growing population, objecting to any new housing development, office park, highway, dam, power plant, or the filling in of wetlands and paving over of farmland.  Yet they refuse to do anything about the <i>cause</i> of our growing population   &mdash;   immigration   &mdash;   because that would be racist.<br>

		<p>Good point, WR: the criminal gangs would still control methamphetamines and cocaine distribution, but methamphetamines aren&rsquo;t grown but produced synthetically, and coca requires a much warmer climate than is found in the United States.  Our state and national parks would at least be free of this problem.</p>
