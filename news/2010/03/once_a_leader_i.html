<h1>Once a Leader in School Diversity, N.C. Retrenches</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When North Carolina&rsquo;s Wake County decided to do away with race-based busing to desegregate schools, local officials came up with a novel solution to maintain balance.</p>
<p>The new method of assigning students by their socio-economic background rather than race helped to keep campuses integrated. Adopted in 2000, it quickly became a blueprint for other school systems.</p>
<p>That policy, however, has never sat well with many suburban parents  &mdash;  often white and middle class  &mdash;  who argue that the student assignment plan sends their kids too far from home. And a new school board, swept into office by those vocal parents, appears poised to scrap it in a vote scheduled for Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The issue has brought the term &#8220;segregation&#8221; and the weight of history into recent school board meetings. Some parents and students around the state capital are now imploring their newly elected leaders to back away from their plan to drastically alter the diversity policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reversing the diversity rules would follow a cascade of similar shifts around the South, and particularly in North Carolina, which once was a model of desegregation. {snip}</p>
<p>In the military town of Goldsboro, starkly divided schools have led civil rights leaders to accuse local school officials of creating &#8220;an apartheid district.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ron Margiotta, the new board chairman in Wake County, vowed that the change there was in the interest of students because it would allow parents more options and refocus families on the schools in their neighborhood. He bristled at any suggestion that the move had something to do with race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The diversity policy in Wake County became a popular model in 2007, when the Supreme Court limited the use of race in how districts assign students. Its current policy sends students to schools to achieve socioeconomic diversity, which also improved racial diversity by frequently sending lower income black children from the city&rsquo;s center to predominantly white schools in the suburbs. {snip}</p>
<p>Margiotta said the busing program has not helped minority students and has distracted from focusing on stronger education policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Ebere Collins, a black mother of two students in the district, said her son travels one hour by bus to get from his home in Raleigh to a middle school in the suburb of Wake Forest. While the trip is long, she feels it helps her son mingle with people outside of the neighborhood and ensures that all students have access to the same resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mix them up, let them experience each other,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By scattering them around, they will enjoy the benefits other people are enjoying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gary Orfield, a UCLA professor who studies busing and civil rights, said the entire South has been resegregating for the past 20 years  &mdash;  which he deemed &#8220;a gigantic historic tragedy.&#8221; He praised Wake County&rsquo;s current policy and warned that a renewed focus on neighborhood school assignment will be most damaging to children who come from poor or uneducated families because those students benefit most from integration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the diversity policy is pulled back, Orfield said, Raleigh can expect to see some of the same impoverished, troubled schools as Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Chicago.</p>
<p>In Charlotte, the site of a groundbreaking Supreme Court case that led to three decades of busing to ensure racial balance, schools have spent much of the past several years resegregating after getting federal court approval to allow parents more choice of where to send their kids.</p>

		<p>busing by economic background? Hmmm. Sounds like a plan to be only around a certain &#8220;type&#8221; of Blacks.</p>
<p>I have always said that White liberals like diversity if it is in thier comfort zone.</p>
<p>The Cliff Huxtable/ Bill Cosby/ Sidney Poitier/ Diahann Carroll/ Vanessa Williams type of Blacks are fine. But they run like hell from the Al Sharpton, Mike Tyson, Leroy Washginton types. </p>

		<p>I see no problem with re-segregation and, in fact, it is inevitable for students to be with other that can relate to. Why put a white student who is passing with honors in a school populated by blacks students of low academic caliber? Channel black students into a curriculum they are suited for and let whites pursue, unencumbered, a more enriched program.  </p>

<p>There can&rsquo;t be very many parents who actually want diversity so the number must be small.</p>
<p>The solution is a magnet diversity school. Anyone who wants diversity could attend. They could have their diversity and leave everyone else alone.<br>

		<p>Please preserve the New South. Don&rsquo;t take us back to the Old South,&#8221; parent Robert Siegel told the school board.</p>
<p>No problem Robert, we&rsquo;ll make note of your name and address and send a bus over to your house to pick up your kids and take them to MLK High, okay!</p>
<p>While the trip is long, she feels it helps her son mingle with people outside of the neighborhood and ensures that all students have access to the same resources.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all well and good &#8220;Ebere&#8221;, IF all the students parents CONTRIBUTE to said resourses!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mix them up, let them experience each other,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;By scattering them around, they will enjoy the benefits other people are enjoying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, scattering &#8220;them&#8221; around would be like scattering around cancer. You&rsquo;re just &#8220;scattering&#8221; the problem. And just what &#8220;benefits&#8221; will White kids enjoy going to an inner city ghetto school! It only benefits blacks because the Whites will fall all over themselves to prove their not racisss. Not to mention they can play the race card whenever it suits them.</p>
<p>If the diversity policy is pulled back, Orfield said, Raleigh can expect to see some of the same impoverished, troubled schools as Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Chicago.</p>
<p>A flat out admission by a liberal that blacks CANNOT make it on their own.</p>
<p>A few miles up the road, at Montclaire Elementary, only 4 percent of the students  &mdash;  just 19 out of 450  &mdash;  are white.</p>
<p>Did you shudder when you read that - I know I did.  </p>

		<p>Here are some things all white liberals agree on:</p>
<p>1.  Black people are incapable of educating their own.  To reach his full potential, a black student must be educated in a classroom with plenty of white children.</p>
<p>2.  Black nations are incapable of fixing the mess themselves when beset by a natural disaster.  White and Asian nations don&rsquo;t need other countries to clean up after their own earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.</p>
<p>3.  Black people are not capable of creating successful businesses so must be hired by white people.</p>

		<p>I know many studies have been done that show that blacks have NOT decreased at all the knowledge gap for themselves by forcing themselves into White schools.  But then, Whites have always known that education cannot be obtained by osmosis.  I wonder though if any study has ever been done to compare average black achievement when they were in their OWN schools versus the failed experiment of integrated schools.  I&rsquo;d bet if an honest study was done, it would be discovered that overall blacks did BETTER when they had their own schools than they do now.  Back in the day of segregated schools, the teachers were all black, the curriculum was tailored to their intelligence and needs, and there were no white teachers to accuse of &#8220;racissssm&#8221; and thereby get a pass for rowdy, inattentive behavior.  Moreover, if a black kid threatened a black teacher, he likely got his butt kicked.  Currently blacks threaten teachers AND students, disrupt classes, skip classes, sell drugs, and spend all their time trying to date white girls and failing that, rape them.  WE don&rsquo;t need the distraction of them, and THEY will learn better without the distraction of our white girls, or the frustrating daily reminder they just aren&rsquo;t as smart as White kids.</p>

<p>Of course he is right. But the implication, IMO, is that the fault will lie with Whites or racism and not with blacks themselves. He seems to be saying that blacks cannot learn if they dont have the proper mix, or diversity, of people around. Strange that Whites do just fine without being enriched by blacks and other minorities. </p>

		<p>I live in NC, and I thank God every day that my husband and I had the foresight to pick a county in NC to buy our home, that had a school district where we wouldn&rsquo;t have this kind of problem. Our kids go to school in such a rural area, busing and reassignment are out of the question. I will also add that these schools are 90% white, and I&rsquo;m thrilled with the curriculum at BOTH schools. The standards are high, and the material challenging enough to keep them interested, just as it should be.</p>

		<p>In nearby Orange Co., the NAACP is protesting the formation of advanced-learning classes, saying  &mdash;  can you believe  &mdash;  that such curricula will leave minority students even farther behind than they are now!  There&rsquo;s only one solution to this kind of thing, and that&rsquo;s resegregated schools.  It&rsquo;s already been suggested, by blacks, and it would be a perfect way for liberals to hide the IQ problem and avoid having to keep repeating the threadbare mantra about slavery, white racism, etc. causing the learning gap.</p>

		<p>Resegregation is happening, but the numbers of white areas have shrunk dramatically.  The time will come when the only places whites can live in are rural farms in cold belts.  Does anyone contemplete the fate of America in 100 years, when it will resemble zimbabwe more than anything else?</p>

		<p>Most of the old white population of Prince George&rsquo;s County, MD resegregated.  In 1970, PG County was over 80 % white and the blacks mostly lived near the District line.  My own town of Seabrook was about 99 % white.  We had busing in 1973 and the schools became chaotic.  The whites began to leave.  By 1990, blacks became the majority in PG County.  Today, blacks are nearly 70 % of the county&rsquo;s population and whites are down to about 25 %, most of whom are old.  The counties bordering the Chesapeake Bay and central Maryland received an explosion of whites fleeing PG County.  Lesson- Busing destroys.  Lesson-  Most whites don&rsquo;t enjoy diversity except in the guise of ethnic restaurants.</p>

		<p>I admit that I did have a privileged education, but it was not for being white.  It was because I was raised by diplomats so I got tutored so that I could remain with my grandparents as they moved around instead of having to stay in boarding school to have stability.  In other words, I was &#8220;homeschooled.&#8221;  Homeschooling is exactly what I would recommend that white parents do.</p>
<p>If your children are underage for school or you are new to your community, don&rsquo;t even tell the school district that your children exist so that you aren&rsquo;t hassled and told that it is illegal to teach your own children.  Then busybody truant officers don&rsquo;t show up at your door to hassle you, which they might otherwise do whether or not you are breaking any laws.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that because you don&rsquo;t belong to some teachers&rsquo; union that you are not qualified to teach your children.  My grandmother got her teaching certificate after we started homeschooling, but I mostly learned on my own because children are so naturally curious.  I learned physics from trips to amusement parks and got real exercise and real science classes during hikes with my grandparents instead of standing around in gym class waiting for some ball to come to me or getting more &#8220;social science&#8221; indoctrination on the evils of Whitey.  I learned about history in lessons that admitted white wrongdoing but certainly didn&rsquo;t portray other races as innocent victims whom never did anything wrong.  I got all of this for much less money than many parents spend on fees and fundraisers for the children&rsquo;s &#8220;free&#8221; education in the public school system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I never saw other kids.  I studied ballet without paying for it as an extracurricular activity while being taught by people who actually cared about ballet and therefore knew the subject.  I was in the church choir and got music lessons.  What I did not get was bullied by school faculty into tolerating bullying from non-white students, and my grandparents paid for things they thought would be good for my brother and I and not what would be good for the race-baiters who expected them to set our best interests aside to tend to those deemed &#8220;less fortunate&#8221; no matter what their incomes and other circumstances might be.  </p>

		<p>Diversity is a cancer that destroys everything it touches whether it&rsquo;s a neighborhood, workplace or a school.  I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when America was still about 85 percent White, when immigrants hadn&rsquo;t reached critical mass and blacks lived in their largely segregated areas.  Memories of uncrowded freeways and plenty of rural open space.  America was the most technologically advanced nation in the world.  It was a leader in almost every conceivable industry and a financial powerhouse that loaned money to the rest of the world. We had the greatest number of the best and brightest minds in the world and the highest standard of living and more freedom than any other people in the world.  How can anyone possible think looking back into the past that diversity is a strength and that we wouldn&rsquo;t be better off without all these minorities?  Every year our nation&rsquo;s demographic changes and every decade that we&rsquo;ve lived through has been worse than the last one and the vast majority of our problems stem directly or indirectly from race, multiculturalism or diversity.   </p>

<p>Ginny:</p>
<p>You were lucky to have such an education.  Far more valuable than sitting in a classroom all day (as a White) and being told that you are an inferior being, responsible for all the world&rsquo;s ill, and that this country is not yours.  </p>
<p>Your White child is taught that the best course of action for him and his people is to hand over their land and wealth, disarm themselves, submit to a vastly superior, NWO non-White civilization and then commit suicide  &mdash;  and not complain about it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe me, thumb through a current high school text or go sit in your child&rsquo;s government classroom for a day.  You&rsquo;ll be shocked what is and more importantly what is not being taught:  milti-culti diversity garbage instead of reading, writing and computation.</p>
<p>As for homeschooling:  Parents do not need a teaching credential to homeschool their children.  There are many new on-line virtual high schools that will teach your child via the Internet  &mdash;  I know because my youngest son was home-schooled for two years via a fully accredited Internet school.  He received a 100% on the state-mandated math test that year and over 95% on the reading test.  When he made the choice to re-attend high school, he was the youngest kid in his honors math class and got the highest grade, he now has an A+ in his honors English class. </p>
<p>If the Kommissars show up at your door, tell &#8216;em your child is being home schooled as is your legal right!  (at the moment)</p>
<p>On another note, I attended a school function at my son&rsquo;s high school last night and right inside the main doorway was the &#8216;diversity club.&rsquo;  They asked my son if he wanted to join and he loudly told them NO  &mdash;  I said I didn&rsquo;t see any Whites in their display or brochure (as my son dragged me away).  I told him they&rsquo;d love to have him in their club as a White male  &mdash;  to debase, mock and impugn him and  if they bother him again, or ask him to join  &mdash;  I advised him to tell them he joined the White Student Union instead to advocate for his Civil Rights. </p>

<p>My wife and I have similar arguments to our friends and relatives. </p>
<p>With gender segregation neither group, pro or con, could claim racism or sexism and the students would likely face less distractions that occured when they are around the opposite sex.</p>
<p>It would be a good idea.</p>
