<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Washington Township police are widening their inquiry into racial incidents at the Turnersville Wal-Mart after the arrest of a juvenile on charges of harassment and bias intimidation, Chief Rafael Muniz said yesterday.</p>
<p>At a noon news conference, Muniz and Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton announced that they had arrested a 16-year-old Atlantic County boy accused of using a store telephone in the home-and-garden section last Sunday to announce over the public-address system: &#8220;Attention, Wal-Mart shoppers: Will all the black people please leave the store. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gloucester County NAACP leaders, who attended the news conference, said they had been told of two other recent incidents at the Wal-Mart, on Route 42.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a man called the store and asked Wal-Mart to tell African Americans to leave. And someone used the store&rsquo;s public-address system several months ago, too, to ask African Americans to leave, they said.</p>
<p>Muniz said he was seeking a warrant to go through Wal-Mart&rsquo;s telephone records to verify and trace the Wednesday call.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The boy was arrested late Friday after Muniz put his 13-member detective staff on the case.</p>
<p>The police were joined by county detectives.</p>
<p>The incident Wednesday was reported by Terence Jones, chairman of the NAACP chapter&rsquo;s fact-finding committee. At 12:21 p.m. that day, he said, a person called the Turnersville Wal-Mart and said, &#8220;You need to get the n- out of Wal-Mart right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones also said that about three or four months ago at the 24-hour superstore, someone had commandeered the public-address system about 2:30 a.m. and asked African Americans to leave.</p>
<p>Muniz said Wal-Mart had not reported either of those incidents to the police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Winters [Gloucester County NAACP president Loretta Winters], of the NAACP, said she would talk to Wal-Mart about <a href="/news/2010/03/whos_still_bias.html#training" target="training" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>setting up sensitivity training.</b></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully, they will welcome us in,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Amazing how a rather tasteless prank is now a criminal offense.  Who, pray tell, was injured?  Of course, if a black had picked up the mike and announced, &#8220;All you white MFs better git out the door,&#8221; absolutely nothing would have happened.</p>
<p>And we all know it.</p>

		<p>Hegelian Dialect at work here:  NAACP eggs on prank callers and teenage boys to make racial slurs at or toward a Wal-Martinez.  NAACP calls for &#8220;sensitivity training.&#8221;  NAACP financially benefits from such &#8220;sensitivity training.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rapes and murders don&rsquo;t get this kind of ploice attention.  I am curious, however, just how did they catch this dangerous and cunning perp?  Where there finger prints on the telephone receiver in the garden department that they could use to track him down?  Does he already have a record?  I need to know, this story is bigger than the first man on the moon and the fall of the Berlin Wall combined!</p>

		<p>This prankster just expressed the desire of 95% of all retailers of every color in this country. Just out of curiousity. I wonder what the annual shoplifting losses due to blacks for Wal Mart are on a national basis.</p>
<p>I have read elsewhere that the prankster was black. Cannot find confirmation but I would not be surprised. If that is the case the media is definitely trying to create the assumption that the prankster was white.</p>

		<p>I think I`ll stir the pot by calling Walmart and suggest that they give blacks huge discounts to make up for this horrible transgression. He should have asked all shoplifters to leave the store. No,wait,then the shoplifters would complain and Walmart would have to apologize to them. I also think that the teen should be sent to a North Korean re-education camp to cure him of his evil ways.Did you see the news conference from the police about this? They acted like they arrested Ted Bundy.I cannot believe how out of control this country is.</p>

<p>Gee, a little slow around the station, huh Muniz? I guess all the other (real) crimes and criminals are solved and have been apprehended?!</p>
<p>Talk about making a MOUNTAIN out of a mole hill! SO WHAT? Who got robbed? Who got raped? Who was murdered? This is nothing more than a prank  &mdash;  nothing more! An immature teenage prank for God&rsquo;s sake and it requires a 13-member detective staff to be put on the case???</p>
<p>Someone once called political correctness as &#8220;Marxist mind control,&#8221; and indeed it is, with the resulting racial hypersensitivity (one-sided, of course), one of its foul by-products, that has gone way toooooo far!</p>
<p>I guarantee you if this was a Black or Hispanic youth, this NEVER would&rsquo;ve made any headlines for these simple facts: </p>
<p>a) The White patrons, 99/1 odds, would have never complained,</p>
<p>b) if they did, the store manager would&rsquo;ve simply apologized to the customer(s) and tell them the guilty employee will be disciplined or fired, </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>c) the police would have NEVER BEEN ALERTED and the anti-White, anti-maintream press would&rsquo;ve never been the wiser.</p>
<p>This is an outrage that this young man, foolish as many young teens are, should be arrested and traumatized for committing a NON-CRIME! When&rsquo;s the last time a violent black or Hispanic criminal  &mdash;  a REAL criminal  &mdash;  received this much focus from the police and media?!</p>
<p>We can thank (curse, actually) the ADL for creating the first hate crimes legislation and successfully lobbying its passage into in law back in 1991 (thanks G. Bush!). And &#8220;in every hamlet in America, police are taught by the ADL, through instructional manuals, seminars and videos, how to define and recognize a &#8220;hate motivated incident.&#8221; Who the hell is this non-elected entity to create such oppressive laws??<br>
 <br>
https://www.hatelawsexposed.org/articles/brainchildofadl.htm</p>
<p>The very concept of &#8220;thought crimes&#8221; is totally foreign to the Western mind! It is the product of those modern-day Bolsheviks, kinsman of those monsters that created the Communist tyranny, a monstrous, evil regime that persecuted, imprisoned, starved to death and/or liquidated 20 to 80 million Russians and nationalities behind their Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>These witch hunts HAVE TO END!</p>

		<p>Sensitivity training for whom?  The staff?  They weren&rsquo;t responsible for this.  So what are they going to do - grab every customer who comes in the store and make them sit through some stupid training?  The fact is, people in this country are getting angrier and more impatient, the more the government takes over, and it comes out in scenarios like this.  Now that healthcare got the House votes, the majority of Americans who are against it are madder than wet hens, and they will take it out on unrelated individuals when they think they can get away with it.   This is a lot bigger than just a race thing.  People are angry   &mdash;   and that is a whole lot larger than the incumbents are willing to even contemplate.</p>

		<p>Quick! Somebody call in the National Guard!  There&rsquo;s a young prankster on the loose in Wal-Mart, and he must be subdued before committing a more serious crime such as hurling racial epithets at Congressional Black Caucus members doing the Selma shuffle into the Capitol building to pass that 2,000 page Healthcare Bill with all those hidden entitlements and amenities.</p>
<p>In my old neighborhood, if that kid was black, his &#8220;pranks&#8221; were more likely to include the use of a weapon and utter disregard for the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of others.  Like the CBC though, he&rsquo;d enjoy relieving them of their hard-earned money for his own benefit; and no telling what other heinous crimes his rap music might inspire him to commit in his quest for personal dignity and racial justice.</p>
<p>I just hope he and his homies will be covered by the new health plan; they and their prey are bound to sustain some injuries from the dangerous games they play.  </p>
<p>Regardless of all the hype about hope, black children of single parent families in black neighborhoods have little hope for meaningful change.  And we affluent, law-abiding white citizens pay to sustain this impossible &#8220;democratic&#8221; social arrangement as long as there are futile liberals obsessed with turning apples into oranges and vice versa.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve been saying, the indulgence of such nonsense is a luxury that only a wealthy and comfortable society can afford. </p>
<p>These fat, spoiled, coddled people have never known wars, revolutions, depressions, civil upheaval, severe economic hardship, destitution.  They have not seen their governments fall or their currencies collapse.  They have not experienced rationing, or had to make do with nothing, nor been reduced to eating the neighborhood cats and dogs and to stripping the bark off trees to make soup (as in WW2 Europe). They have not been bombed out of their homes, driven from their countries, incarcerated in detention camps, or been occupied by foreign troops, or suffered, homeless and starving, through freezing winters.   </p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t know how lucky they are! All their lives the welfare checks and benefits have kept coming.  But a prank announcemant while out shopping gets them in a tizzy.  And so, these &#8220;children&#8221; who have never known a cancer, whine and cry about a pimple!</p>

		<p>This is absolutely INSANE. A 13 member detective staff and county detectives investigating a harmless prank???<br>
I was curious about crime stats for this county. Is there <br>
really such a low amount of crime there that they can dedicate this amount of manpower to a teenage prank?<br>
The answer is no. https://tinyurl.com/yh2t83f</p>
<p>I wonder if victims of real crimes that have gone unsolves appreciate this much man power going to a harmless teenage prank? How many times a day, every day do whites face ethnic intimidation and harassment from blacks? If we reported it we would probably be the ones in trouble for making frivolous reports or abusing 911. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering if this kid is not white.<br>
This from Philly.com:<br>
&#8220;Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen&rsquo;s age, and would not disclose the teen&rsquo;s race, saying that did not factor into the investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a disgrace this is. How is itthat a 16 year old boy pulling a completely harmless prank is in the press for a week and soething like the Knoxville Horror doesn&rsquo;t get so much as a whisper. <br>
What a sickening state this world is in.</p>

  <br>
Muniz said he was seeking a warrant to go through Wal-Mart&rsquo;s telephone records to verify and trace the call. <br>

<p>Splendid!   What excellent police work!  They are to be commended for such a remarkably rapid resolution to this unspeakable crime.  Of course, thirteen detectives, reinforced by additional county detectives, could be expected to get some impressive  results.  And the use of all that manpower was fully justified, and the public expense involved, considering the heinous nature of the crime. It is encouraging to know that our police are on the job to protect us from such dreadful things.</p>
<p>Speaking of effective police work, I wonder what progress is being made on the four Amren cases in Virginia where lives were threatened and 300 people denied their constitutional rights of assembly and speech.  I realize this is a much more minor matter involving only white people, but I can&rsquo;t help wondering.  Any progress being made there?<br>

		<p>Good.Bring in &#8220;sensitivity training.&#8221; What better way to alienate still more Whites against Blacks. What a bunch of whining crybabies. An admittedly bad joke by a teen&hellip; blown way out of proportion with respect to any real damage.</p>

		<p>How much of this &#8216;outreach to blacks&rsquo; program will eat into company profits?  How much of this sensitivity training nonsense will make the share price go down?  How much of this black whinefest that the company has to provide will shut them up once and for all?</p>

		<p>I would bet that the pressure to put on the task force came from almighty Wal-Mart, that likely feared anti-black rumors in the ghetto.  Epodunk.com indicates that Atlantic Co., the culprit&rsquo;s home, is 18% black, with slightly smaller ratios of Italian and Irish.  But, even if the boy was black, the PC media may ask, &#8220;Well, just why would he make such an announcement?  Did he feel unwelcome?&#8221;  </p>

<p>Amazing. This must have been America&rsquo;s most wanted man&hellip; (well, kid).  It&rsquo;s good to know that we have such excellent police protection.</p>

		<p>the NAACP, said she would talk to Wal-Mart about setting up sensitivity training.<br>
&ldquo;Hopefully, they will welcome us in,&rdquo; she said.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>But what good will it do to &#8220;train&#8221; Walmart&rsquo;s staff? The kid was a customer! <br>
  <br>
Oh well, it will be a good opportunity to &#8220;train&#8221; them anyway; and maybe she&rsquo;ll be called in to do the job, with a hefty fee involved.  That ain&rsquo;t so bad!</p>

		<p>This from Philly.com:<br>
&ldquo;Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen&rsquo;s age, and would not disclose the teen&rsquo;s race, saying that did not factor into the investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s being prosecuted as a racially motivated hate crime, then the teen&rsquo;s race is a factor.</p>

		<p>This speaks to another issue altogether - America has too many police period! I remember reading several decades back that many were growing concerned at the even growing police presence in this nation and the increasing militarization of local police forces. I believe these concerns were more than valid. </p>
<p>If this town can dispatch it&rsquo;s entire force of thirteen(they realy need 13 detectives anyway?)tp investigate a silly child&rsquo;s prank, they are obviously overstaffed and needing to re-direct their efforts toward more important things. </p>
<p>America shouldn&rsquo;t need armies of policemen to, <br>
&#8220;keep the peace&#8221; in a civilized nation - and America once was, for the overwhelming part, a civilized nation. You can blame all that has changed since the mid-twentieth century for bringing us <br>
to the police-state mentality. And now we all suffer!</p>

		<p>Is anyone noticing a national pattern with this sort of thing?  The NAACP, determined not to be relegated to the scrap-heap of irrelevance, seems to be omnipresent whenever these tempests-in-a-teapot erupt.  </p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the NAACP wasn&rsquo;t encouraging this sort of nonsense as a way of pulling media attention and donations away from Sharpton, et al. </p>
<p>On the national level, the NAACP seems to have a big legal department to feed, the Hollywood &#8220;Image&#8221; Awards, their Prison Project, etc. All this requires money - but even more - they need to remind everyone that they are still relevant in order to crank-up the white guilt and black fear that keeps those dollars flowing in.<br>

<p>Indeed!  It&rsquo;s the insanity of our age. It&rsquo;s a mass psychosis.<br>
Diversity, multi-culturalism, anti-racism have become the new religion.</p>
<p>They say every generation has its follies. This is ours. <br>
But this goes beyond mere folly   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s become sheer lunacy!</p>
<p>The nation - the whole white world   &mdash;   is in the grip of this mass mania.  And any nonconformist who doesn&rsquo;t go along with the general nuttiness is branded as &#8220;sick&#8221; and morally depraved   &mdash;   a social outlaw.  What a crazy world we live in!<br>

<p>Year after year we read of the increasing need for more police, and more taxes and funding to hire even MORE police.  Our politicians are constantly wailing for more police.  And then, having raised taxes or closed libraries or reduced senior citizen services (or else gotten funds from Washington), in a few more years we need still MORE police!  And so on.  Endlessly.  I have seen this as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>It was inevitable   &mdash;   if we had stopped to think and had foreseen it, back in the 60s and 70s   &mdash;   that the integration of America (not to mention the abandonment of our borders)  would  also  mean the increased policing of America. </p>
<p>We naively thought we were going to uplift them and transform them into nice, law-abiding, middle-class Americans   &mdash;   just other white people under black skin.    That didn&rsquo;t happen!   Instead, they have dragged American society  and all our culture down toward their own level. </p>
<p>In all aspects of American life, we see the &#8220;dumbing-down&#8221; and degeneration going on around us.  It should be no surprise, then, that there would be a greater need for police services   &mdash;   as there is in EVERY black community.</p>

		<p>i heard this on the radio in my car&hellip; i had to spit out my soda i was laughing so hard . but sadly its where this race hustling group of diversitoids in this country have brought us. i&rsquo;ve been reading many stories about supposed hate crimes where a black cries someone called me a &#8220;N&#8221; or wrote it on my locker in school, which brings in the liberal school administrators to stamp out the hate(in young whites) of course. then the story makes the front page of the local lib news rag, lambasting the white racist towns, next step is the townspeople and kids need racial sensitivity training at taxpayer expense of course. the trainers are the ADF or the NAACP both marxist anti-american groups bent on social justice in this formerly great country.when the investigations are done, its usually a  hate crime hoax and the liberal media, and school admin. just quietly dismiss the black haters who committed the hoax. </p>
