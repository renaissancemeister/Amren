<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/nyregion/16haiti.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Immigration Offer Draws Few Haitians</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anne Barnard, New York Times, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Within days of the devastating earthquake in Haiti on Jan. 12, the United States government declared that Haitians living illegally in the United States were eligible for temporary protected status, a special immigration designation that temporarily allows them to work here legally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two months after the earthquake, and a third of the way to the July deadline to file for the special status, just 34,427 of the estimated 100,000 to 200,000 undocumented Haitians who were in the United States before Jan. 12 have applied, said the Department of Homeland Security. The protected status allows 18 months of legally working.</p>
<p>Charitable groups blame the lag on the application fees, which total about $500. The average monthly amount that Haitians abroad send to relatives in Haiti  &mdash;  a pillar of the country&rsquo;s economy  &mdash;  is just $150, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. On Monday, a broad coalition of charities called on the government to make it easier for applicants to have the fee waived.</p>

		<p>Ha!, this could mean a few things:</p>
<p>a) they are so oblivious they don&rsquo;t know about the offer.</p>
<p>b) they are so cheap or destitute they can&rsquo;t afford $500</p>
<p>c) immigration enforcement is so lax they don&rsquo;t see the need</p>
<p>d) all of the above</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with d</p>

<p>Thus must ask a very simple question: how does Haiti even deserve being called a country, when its economy is only supported by $150 inflows from their exported parasites, &ldquo;toiling&rdquo; abroad in North America&rsquo;s &ldquo; luxurious exploitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover,why is it that these 100,000 to 200,000 undocumented Haitians, now being &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo;  in the USA (so productive and enriching to us, as they are) cannot do so for &ldquo;canonized&rdquo; Haiti?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t these Haitian wonders abroad, even ask the simple question: &lsquo;What might a Chilean do, in these seismically hard times?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get why the Chileans have been held up as models of good behavior after a disaster.  It seems almost like hallucination to claim so.  There was plenty of violent looting that continued for days and the army was called in.  </p>

 <br>
And that is the point - Chile is civilized enough that they have a disciplined army to maintain law and order.  Try and find a black army that wouldn&rsquo;t just join in on the mayhem!  </p>
<p>Does Haiti even have an army or national police force?  Wouldn&rsquo;t matter much, would it.</p>

<p>I simply cannot nor ever will, understand these religious people,. to include my wife and her mormon church! The religions in Afrimerica are NOT helping Christians, quite the opposite in fact. We are gonna pay for all of this do gooding in the near future NOT 20 or 30 years down the road but less than 5 I think.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering why White people think the conduct in Haiti and Chili should be any different than it was in NOLA! In Haiti, the reasons for social collapse are obvious, also, there was no no society to start with. In Chili, we have lots of undiciplined hispanic types.</p>

<p>Plenty of violent looting?? When the 5th strongest earthquake in recorded history strikes ANYWHERE, and I am including majority European-White countries, make no mistake about it, the criminal element will do some looting.  Chile handled (and continues to handle) themselves remarkably well in the face of such a disaster.  Haiti&rsquo;s &#8220;response&#8221; was predictably deplorable.  I think the Chileans fared fare better than we would have, if an 8.8 quake struck California&rsquo;s Bay Area for example.</p>

		<p>In the aftermath of Chile&rsquo;s earthquake, I don&rsquo;t recall thousands of Chileans sailing in boats to the USA. That&rsquo;s one of the differences between Chileans and Haitians.</p>
