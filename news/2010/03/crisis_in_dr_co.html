<h1><a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8530000/8530686.stm">Crisis in DR Congo</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Thomson, BBC News, February 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>12 year-old, Henri, which is not his real name, points at a large fresh looking scar on his midriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;People accused me of sorcery and my mother believed them,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, here on my stomach. She tried to kill me with a knife. It really hurt and I cannot understand why my mother did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henri, who is now being given help by a children&rsquo;s charity, had been playing outside his home in Goma, eastern Congo, when the accusations began.</p>
<p>His eyes begin to water as he remembers pleading with his mother, telling her that the claims were completely untrue. Not that this made any difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;She threw me out of the house and told me to go away,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Henri was then forced to live on the streets until charity workers convinced his mother that the allegations were untrue.</p>
<p><b>Growing problem</b></p>
<p>His is just one of a fast growing number of children accused of sorcery to come to the attention of Unicef&rsquo;s head of child protection in Congo, Alessandra Dentice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children accused of witchcraft is unfortunately one of the major increasing child protection issues in the country,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Unicef&rsquo;s latest available statistics show that around one hundred cases of child sorcery allegations were referred to them in 2008 in the North Kivu province of Eastern Congo alone.</p>
<p>That number increased nearly fivefold to 450 in the same area last year.</p>
<p>Alessandra Dentice believes this may be explained by a growing awareness of the problem that has led to more reports rather than more cases.</p>
<p>But, she says, recent events in violence-plagued Eastern Congo might also explain the rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a country where is no social cohesion any longer, there is no sense of community, no sense of family,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, whenever anything happens at family or community level it is very easy for them to blame someone who is powerless and seems to have no rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Dentice went on tell me how serious sorcery allegations can be for the children concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of these children are beaten up or burnt. Unfortunately it is very common,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just received this morning a report about a girl of 12-years-old who has been burnt because she was accused of witchcraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Anglican Bishop of Bukavu, Josue Bulambo Lembelembe, is also very concerned by the apparent increase in sorcery allegations against children here.</p>
<p>&#8220;It only takes somebody in a family to fall ill and a child can be accused of sorcery,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Particularly if the youngster accused lives on the street. Then they point to him or her and say they caused the illness or other problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Death threat</b></p>
<p>Not far across Goma, I approached the offices of the charity, Childrens Voice.</p>
<p>Having heard that I was coming, more than 200 youngsters, standing in long neat lines, burst into song as I drove through the gates. In charge was the charity&rsquo;s local Director, Monossay Bodween Odette.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found many of these children on the streets without parents or any kind of support,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;When children accused of sorcery of sorcery are abandoned on the streets life is very hard for them. People throw stones at them and many get badly hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why we go from house to house telling people not to listen to claims of child sorcery. We know that if our message fails to get through, some children will die.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is here that I met 14-year-old, Jean, though I have been asked not to give his real name because of past threats against him. A tall sullen looking boy, Jean seems nervous and withdrawn.</p>
<p>But when I ask him to tell me about the witchcraft accusations against him he sits up straight and begins to tell me his story.</p>
<p>It all started, he says, after he went to see a Nigerian horror film about zombies.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this movie one person was raising the dead with a stick. I was with a friend and we went to a cemetery to play and try and act out the movie,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when my friend saw me doing this he ran away and accused me of being a sorcerer to his parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean goes on to tell me that his friend&rsquo;s parents came to his grandparents house where he was living and told them that he was a sorcerer and would have to be burned.</p>
<p>Then, he says, his grandparents gave him a beating before taking him down to the offices of the local authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;The head of the authority beat me with a stick and told me to say that I was a sorcerer. He forced me to say it. People were waiting outside to kill me,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Jean was then brought before a local priest who confirmed that he was a sorcerer.</p>
<p>It was only after the Children&rsquo;s Voice charity visited his grandparents and warned them that making witchcraft allegations against children is now illegal, that the matter was finally dropped.</p>
<p>But the existence of a recently introduced law under the Child Protection Code is one thing. Enforcing it can be quite another, according to local lawyer, Antonie Famber.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that most people here still believe in witchcraft so this makes the law very hard to enforce,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make matter worse even some government officials believe in sorcery themselves. Take the case of a colleague of mine who is also a lawyer. He knows that the law does not recognise sorcery but he has accused his own children of witchcraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Unicef&rsquo;s, Alessandra Dentice says the new law, which took eight years to get on the statute books and carries a maximum penalty of three years jail, is helping .</p>
<p>She believes that it has helped make people take a current radio and television campaign seriously and may also have prompted more people to report accusations made.</p>
<p>Not that such legal threats are making everyone here contrite.</p>
<p>12-year-old Henri, who revealed how he was stabbed by his mother after neighbours accused him of sorcery, told me how she responded after accepting that he was not guilty after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&rsquo;t say sorry to me. She didn&rsquo;t say anything.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Sadly the truth be told this is very typical of the Majority Africans. I am from Africa ( Kenya)  and I can tell you that many Africans ( even some educated or born again Christians) like to think that Sorcery is the major cause of everything! That is why we remain a backward society despite the efforts of a few. Incidentally Africans only think only WHITE PEOPLE or ASIANS are IMMUNE FROM SORCERY that is why they automatically peg their own as being the bewitchers! Shameful but true!</p>

<p>Dear Henri, Your Mother has very low IQ.  She cannot think or reason.  She is incapable of simple logic.  Therefore she does stupid things.  It is no one&rsquo;s fault.  God made each of us different.  That&rsquo;s Diversity, and it is our Greatest Strength.  We need to celebrate it!</p>
<p>Good luck, son.  Next time try to choose a Mother with higher intellegence.</p>

		<p>I once worked at a place that had a very nice Black lady as a weekend supervisor. During a slow time we were talking about decorating and furniture, etc. I happened to mention that I love antiques and have a few pieces of nice antebellum furniture in my house. She said she would never buy antiques because it might bring spirits into the house. What a strange statement. It must be a Black thing even if they&rsquo;re born and bred here for many generations.  </p>

		<p>Wow, this story is SO reminiscent of the Salem Witch Trials of the 1600&rsquo;s in this country!!  What that tells me is that these people are 400 years behind the world of today   &mdash;   no WONDER they can&rsquo;t get educated, can&rsquo;t govern themselves without turning to tyrrany, can&rsquo;t even put in toilets with septic tanks!!  How pathetic.  I don&rsquo;t think that we can catch them up, either; they are somehow just going to have to let evolution bring them into the world of the present.  Of course, with the aggressive small countries building nukes, the modern world may soon be nonexistent and then the Africans can feel superior&hellip;.</p>

<p>You are from Africa and you are reading this side? Lol, me too :-)<br>
I am now living in Europe and go to the University  and have good marks. But I always asked myself, how could it be my whole family was so irrational. My brothers were not good at school, one got criminal and made a lot of stupid things. I always asked myself why? Why was he able to completely set his brain into the &#8220;off-modus&#8221;?<br>
But furthermore nobody of my peoples was reaching anything here under the same conditions as russian immigrants who are reaching much more. Not one of my peoples I know is good at school, not one reached the University.<br>
And I think Amren is quiet right. There is only one explanation. Maybe I will never have kids because I think my children will be like my brothers. I will adopt a russian baby. And yes, Jared Taylor is right, when he says that many other races know there are race differences and whites are intelligent. I one day talked with my brother and could see he knows it. And my grandfather always said: &#8220;The brain of white man is workin&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes but it is more than that. It appears they lack even the most basic ability to bond and protect their own offspring. That instinct is hormonally instilled in virtually all mammals, especially people, but apparently blacks often lack even that trait.</p>
<p>The pro-diversity folks love to show the starving babies in Africa and claim those people think just like us, feel just like us, mourn for their starving babies just like we would. They often really don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Equatorial Africa/Black Africans+poor,corrupt societies+violence+backward superstitious(low IQ)+no health care,rampant disease=lots of sick kids&hellip;&hellip;.lots of  said kids being branded as sorcerers/witches or is this a convenient way to get rid of unwanted children by accusing then killing the unfortunate children?And since the kids were witches the &#8220;parents&#8221;  can feel no remorse.</p>

		<p>Good grief! None of this is news within africa whether east, west, north or south. Many investigations have been conducted, mainly by British reporters, possibly because we have many africans who have arrived on our shores within living memory and are not a legacy of slaves toiling in our non-existent cotton, sugar cane or tobacco plantations in the UK. Nigeria has launched a crackdown on the abuse of children branded as witches following an investigation by Channel 4&rsquo;s Dispatches programme. The programme, called Saving Africa&rsquo;s Witch Children, detailed how young children accused of witchcraft were being abandoned, tortured, starved and murdered - all in the name of Jesus Christ. A man calling himself &#8220;the bishop&#8221;, who said he had killed more than 100 people possessed by the devil, has now been arrested after being exposed in the programme, broadcast last month. Chief Godswill Akpabio, governor of Akwa Ibom state, has pledged to &#8220;destroy and demolish&#8221; every church engaged in such practices. The state will also now strengthen laws to protect children from those who trade on superstitions about black magic. He added: &#8220;We must fight against the abuse of children and ensure proper education for them.&#8221;  Gary Foxcroft, the director of Stepping Stones, a charity which provided much of the information for the programme, said: &#8220;The international outrage generated by the film has led to the Akwa Ibom State Government taking urgent action to address the gross violations of child rights that have been taking place in the state due to the belief in child &#8216;witches&rsquo;. &#8220;Stepping Stones Nigeria welcomes this positive intervention and sincerely hopes that this will mark the beginning of a more long term governmental strategy to help protect and save the lives of stigmatised children in Akwa Ibom State.&#8221;<br>

In a backward superstitious ignorant population&hellip;and children not being able to physically strike at their violent tormentors in the village&hellip;..maybe they DID resort to sorcery.<br>
Nahh&hellip;everybody knows the children are innocent, especially Westerners who come throught the village every now and then and tell te locals what to believe about their neighbor.</p>

<p>Yes I am from Africa and sorely disappointed by many Africans&rsquo; conduct. They have now started to hunt Albinos for Body parts that prevent Witch Craft.</p>
<p>Like My Enlightened AFRICAN FATHER WARNS US</p>
<p><br>
Africans are people to look at NOT TO HAVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH.</p>
<p>In fact I vow to stay single as my Parents have refused for me to marry An African or a Black American or a Black anything coz MOST are prone to believe in Superstitions.</p>
<p>We keep our associations to a minimum with these Africans mainly with a few relatives here and there. I am not racist or self- hating.</p>
<p>But any person who has lived in Africa even the Africans know the difficulty that the Ignorance and Backwardness inherent in the fabric of the African Culture has bestowed on the continent.</p>
<p>Sadly all this is true and what pains me is that many Africans don&rsquo;t see this and try to change their behavior.</p>

<p>I am not African but Arab. I do not know much about blacks but everything you said is the same with my people even more extreme. I am not self-hating too, I just do not want that the white man, who rescued my life is killed be my peoples, who actually should be thankful of Germans but instead hate Germans.<br>
And I do not want that my sister one day live in a Arab-only country, where she has the same value of a cow and is not treated like a human.</p>

		<p>I happened to catch a broadcast of 20/20 last Friday night that had a segment on child sacrifice and black magic in Uganda. The story was fascinating and I almost died of surprise when I saw it on mainstream TV. The nvestigation of child sacrifice revealed that wealthy Ugandan business men were paying to have children kidnapped and sacrificed to give the tycoons an edge in their financial dealings. One guy sacrificed a kid and buried him in the foundation of his under construction office building. Another poor farmer featured killed HIS OWN SON for money! The boy was decapitated and the head delivered to some rich guy. </p>

<p>Both of you are correct about your respective peoples, and that tribalism is exactly WHY those peoples will never have viable civilizations without Western (read Caucasian) assistance and maintenance. Those same peoples do not and never will have any viable military power beyond the usual looting, raping, robbing, burning and pillaging which, of course, is the usual province of American blacks.</p>

		<p>I had to take a college class on African history once.  There were a few actual &#8216;from Africa&rsquo; people in the class (there were no American blacks in the class).  In class discussions, the Africans explained to us white folk how black magic is real and that there truly are witch doctors who can really control the spirits, lift curses, etc&hellip;  They spoke with such conviction, the rest of us were visibly uncomfotable, like when you see a scary movie that is so realistic that you feel the vibe for the moment.  After that class my respect for African culture plummeted.</p>

		<p>These accusations usually occur when the children start to get older and begin to need assistance in joining the adult world in some economic fashion (such as it exists in Africa). They are no longer cute little babies or toddlers and their parents don&rsquo;t want the economic burden of taking care of them. So, the parents accuse their children of being sorcerers or conveniently &#8220;believe&#8221; the rantings of a fellow African who accuses their child of practicing magic, and then the parents have an excuse to remove their child from the family unit (probably because they have too many children) and/or kill their own child.</p>
