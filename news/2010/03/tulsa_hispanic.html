			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Randy Krehbiel, Tulsa World, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bill that would require Oklahoma public schools to verify the immigration status of all students and report it to the state Department of Education drew fire from Tulsa Hispanic leaders Monday as well as criticism from Tulsa Public Schools Superintendent Keith Ballard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, representatives of the Tulsa Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said the measure, House Bill 3384, by Rep. Randy Terrill, R-Moore, would create an unfunded mandate for already-strapped schools and is a step toward shutting illegal immigrants out of public education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terrill denied that HB 3384 would infringe on any child&rsquo;s access to public education or that its cost to schools would be significant. He said his only purpose is gathering accurate information about the cost of educating illegal immigrant children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, some schools are gathering this information already,&#8221; Terrill said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terrill said he has no firm plans for using the data that would be collected by the schools. He did say, however, that he expects the data to show the cost of educating illegal immigrants to be &#8220;stunningly high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such figures could be helpful in a challenge of the 1982 decision, which was based in part on the court&rsquo;s finding that Texas had not proved that a &#8220;substantial interest&#8221; would be served by excluding illegal immigrant children from public schools.</p>

<p>Wow, these people are SMART&hellip;whadaya think, they got IQs of at least 80?<br>
Such a grasp of the fine points&hellip;that Americans plan to shut out ILLEGAL immigrants from PUBLICLY FUNDED education. Who&rsquo;d have thought a nation would try to cut the profit from criminal infiltration, identity theft and a host of other offenses in a time of economic collapse. The Audacity.<br>
What stupendous, shining MORONS. You just can&rsquo;t beat the outright retarted bluster of Hispanics when they get going.</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s a &#8220;Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.&#8221; Sounds like a bunch of racists to me. </p>

		<p>I must add that by the &#8220;&hellip;retarded bluster of Hispanics when they get going,&#8221; I mean those who are chauvanistic nationalist, imperialist, racist invaders hell bent on conquest and imagined revenge. Triumphalists who ironically come from utterly failed, despotic, violent, poverty and ignorance -stricken places.  ( By no means are all Hispanics this way). Too bad that many are, though.<br>

		<p>They will find that the high cost is in fact in dollars, but the higher cost is in the quality of public education.  Directly because of high illegal immigrant kids in a number of cities in SoCA, public education has turned into a pit.  The kids have no incentive to learn English since their parents don&rsquo;t care if they do, and fewer than 1/3 of them graduate from high school.  As for the white parents, they move out of their old neighborhoods that have now become barrios, and they send their kids to private schools or homeschool them, or a combination of homeschooling and charter schooling.  No white parent in his/her right mind would send their white children to public schools in these areas.</p>
