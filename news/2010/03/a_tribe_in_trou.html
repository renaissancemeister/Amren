<h1><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15603730">A Tribe in Trouble</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Economist, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TWO compelling documentaries illuminate the dilemmas facing Africa&rsquo;s dwindling white tribes. One is set in Zimbabwe, the other in Kenya. The Zimbabwean film, &#8220;Mugabe and the White African&#8221;, is the more straightforward and should be shown as widely as possible to help end one of Africa&rsquo;s great tragedies: the ruin of one of the continent&rsquo;s most successful countries and the moral bankruptcy of the governments of the nearby states (bar plucky Botswana) for failing to isolate and oust a vile dictator.</p>
<p>It shows how a brave film company, embedding itself with a beleaguered family of white farmers off and on for a year, can bring to life the horrors that have befallen an entire country. Like the large majority of the 5,000-odd white farmers who stayed on after Robert Mugabe became prime minister in 1980 and later president, Mike Campbell and his son-in-law Ben Freeth acquired their farm and the regulation government certificate showing that no black citizen also sought to buy the same farm, which then became Zimbabwe&rsquo;s largest producer of mangoes and employed 500 locals. When a man with ministerial connections claimed the property for himself a few years ago, Messrs Campbell and Freeth refused to go, prompting a campaign of intimidation, arson and assault, including the beating up not just of the two farmers but also their wives, all horrifically shown on screen.</p>
<p>When they took their case to a tribunal of the Southern African Development Community, a 15-nation club including both Zimbabwe and South Africa, and won, Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s thugs ignored the verdict and burned down the farmsteads. Much of this is covertly filmed, sometimes by the farmers themselves, with wobbly camera shots enhancing the sense of chaos and terror. It is impossible to watch without feeling sympathy for the farmers and their loyal but terrified black workers, and revulsion for the barbarities of Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s regime. A shocking postscript is that, although the film is to be screened on British television&rsquo;s Channel 4, no cinema in neighbouring South Africa, which could stop Mr Mugabe in his tracks, has yet seen fit to air it.</p>

<p>Well, that would be airing the truth, especially about blacks (some but not all)&hellip;and we can&rsquo;t have that, now can we?</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;It is impossible to watch without feeling sympathy for the farmers&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Implying that it was ever possible <i>not</i> to feel sympathy for them?  Are we being cued to believe that sympathizing with the White victims of black savagery should be considered somehow unusual?</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;<b>&hellip;and their loyal but terrified black workers</b>, and revulsion for the barbarities of <b>Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s regime</b>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Even while giving this documentary a favorable review, it seems the governmedia can&rsquo;t help reminding us that &#8220;they&rsquo;re not all bad,&#8221; and that it&rsquo;s &#8220;Mr. Mugabwe&rsquo;s regime&#8221; that&rsquo;s the problem, rather than blacks themselves.</p>
<p>Media Manipulation 101.  It&rsquo;s all in the nuances.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t wan to sound too harsh, but ALL whites in Africa should have left when they had the chance. Once whites lost power in Africa, what was stopping blacks from exacting revenge? Even in South Africa, which is depicted as becoming racially harmonious under Nelson Mandela (or at least one would get impression from watching &#8220;Invictus,&#8221; which I thought was a good movie regardless), race relations are rotten. </p>
<p>I know this isn&rsquo;t very realistic, but I propose a population exchange. All whites living in Africa ought to pack up and leave and go back to Europe. Meanwhile, all blacks in Europe ought to go back to Africa. They had a similar population exchange between Greece and Turkey, so why not Europe and Africa?</p>

		<p>to #4:  I have thought that many times and suggested that here and on youtube, but I don&rsquo;t see whites leaving Africa for Europe nor do I see blacks leaving the White West anytime soon to head back for Africa.  The non-whites like to live around us to kill us and leech off of our goodies, while the whites in Africa are so naive to think things will get better, that they &#8216;need a new government&rsquo; and all that.  you won&rsquo;t change the basic, unpleasant nature of Africans, white people.  You just won&rsquo;t.  Leave them in their own continent and we keep them out of ours.  Offer no money, no sympathy, no charity, no feelings of guilt and  &mdash;  for god sakes  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t adopt any african kids.</p>

		<p>I would like to point out that in neither south africa nor zimbabwe did whites actually lose a war, resulting in a wipe out of their power base.  They simply lost their minds one day, listened to liberals from the western world and handed over the keys to the kingdom to the local black gang members.</p>
<p>There was no change or transfer of power other than the willingness to cooperate and both these countries are so pathological that they cannot maintain functioning economies, energy sectors, food production, let alone a standing army of any power.  We are talking about millions of white people.</p>
<p>There is nothing keeping them from simply concentrating their numbers and then not allowing blacks in their new smaller land they take for themselves.  Heck with the right bribes, they&rsquo;d cooperate.  For example, get together some high IQ whites and grow some of the most potent heroin, cocaine and probably some other stuff nobody knows about that is ten times as addictive.  Grow some and offer it to their black neighbors VERY cheap, in exchange for ALOT of guns and the right to be left alone.  In hundred years, most of that area if africa will be whites only&hellip;..while the black population would vanish (and not care that they vanished).</p>

		<p>The Economist magazine is one of the forces responsible for the plight of whites in Africa through its relentless arguments against white people having any kind of racial consciousness.  In the Economist&rsquo;s world view, all people are interchangeable widgets.  The Economist wants whites to engage in unilateral disarmament by giving up all of our group loyalty, despite the fact that the other races have made it clear that they will never give up their own group loyalties.  </p>

<p>Diversity = control.  This is deliberate, not for votes but control (for the actual people making the decisions at the very top of society).  The population is splintered.  There is no consensus.  It is far easier to control us this way.<br>

		<p>As went the Belgian Congo, so went Algeria and then Zimbabwe. The &#8216;Wind of Change&rsquo; blew and it&rsquo;s still blowing.</p>
<p>South Africa is going down the toilet and no amount of &#8216;Kumbaya&rsquo; feel-good stuff on MSM TV can alter the reality.</p>
<p>The Jews are leaving, fully half the Apartheid-era Jewish population has left already; professionally qualified non-Jewish whites are leaving in droves and the [South] Asians, who know all about the joys of confiscatory African nationalism, are heading for Australia and Canada and New Zealand as fast as they can.</p>
