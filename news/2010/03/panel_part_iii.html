			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Nightengale, USA Today, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fans look down from their seats onto the baseball field, see dark-colored skin and might assume they are African-American players.</p>
<p>But increasingly, the players instead hail from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or Venezuela.</p>
<p>&#8220;People see dark faces out there, and the perception is that they&rsquo;re African American,&#8221; Los Angeles Angels center fielder Torii Hunter says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not us. They&rsquo;re impostors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even people I know come up and say, &#8216;Hey, what color is Vladimir Guerrero? Is he a black player?&rsquo; I say, &#8216;Come on, he&rsquo;s Dominican. He&rsquo;s not black.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Baseball&rsquo;s African-American population is 8%, compared with 28% for foreign players on last year&rsquo;s opening-day rosters.</p>
<p>&#8220;As African-American players, we have a theory that baseball can go get an imitator and pass them off as us,&#8221; Hunter says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s like they had to get some kind of dark faces, so they go to the Dominican or Venezuela because you can get them cheaper. It&rsquo;s like, &#8216;Why should I get this kid from the South Side of Chicago and have Scott Boras represent him and pay him $5 million when you can get a Dominican guy for a bag of chips?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s sad.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>RBI program</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Scouting system faulted</b></p>
<p>There also might be flaws in the scouting system. Milwaukee Brewers pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who grew up in Gary, Ind., and Hunter, from Pine Bluff, Ark., say few scouts bothered to watch them in high school. Too much crime, they say, too much poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not just the white scouts,&#8221; Hunter says. &#8220;Most black scouts aren&rsquo;t going there either. I thought most guys would want to go into those areas to find the next Jackie Robinson or Hank Aaron.&#8221;</p>
<p>Says J Harrison, the Reds special assistant and former amateur scout: &#8220;I wish this game would take more chances on black athletes. We need to go watch a football game like we have in the past and take a chance on a guy.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Out-of-reach academies</b></p>
<p>The urban academies were designed to help attract inner-city athletes, but the major problem is transportation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common for high schools to arrange transportation for their kids to attend practices and games, but how do kids get to the academies if no one is home to drive them?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Says Hunter: &#8220;I looked at all of the (charity) work I&rsquo;ve been doing, and 60% to 70% of the African-American homes are single-parent homes. And they&rsquo;re all mothers. It&rsquo;s hard for a mother to take their kids to practice every day, pay the $1,200 a month to travel and $1,200 for a tournament team.&#8221;</p>
<p>One solution, the committee suggests, is to bring equipment, better fields and qualified instructors  &mdash;  such as retired major leaguers  &mdash;  to the neighborhoods rather than construct complexes in locations difficult to reach.</p>
<p>Baseball spends $8 million to $12 million a team, Boras says, scouting and developing players in Latin America countries. Yet that same amount might be better spent in the USA, the committee says, developing American kids.</p>
<p>Boras notes there has been a paucity of South Korean impact players  &mdash;  four have had careers longer than five years  &mdash;  relative to the money spent scouting there.</p>

		<p>Baseball requires discipline, courage, self control, patience and intelligence. Also it requires about a 5 year training regimen unless you are an innate super star like Mays or Mantle. If you get busted for beating up your baby`s momma, caught selling smack, or punching out somebody half your size, they don`t hire you because they can`t afford to take the chance. Minor league money is chump change so no self respecting kid who wants his own posse by age 19 would give it a try. You also have to be a team player. Being a spoiled brat who complains about not enough playing time or that the manager disses you about your tats disqualifies you up front.It is a crying shame that white players cheated for the last decade or more. The sport has lost it`s statistical edge and now is just another freak show except not quite as freaky as the Nothing but Africans Basketball league or the National Felon Football league.<br>

		<p>Apparently Mr. Hunter doesn&rsquo;t understand the difference between race and nationality.<br>
I&rsquo;d like someone to show me Dominican player who makes less than his  black American counterparts because he&rsquo;s Dominican, and while you&rsquo;re at it, show me any ballplayer, of any race or nationality, the nefarious Scott Boras wouldn&rsquo;t represent.<br>

		<p>Torii Hunter and Vladimir Guerrero almost look alike.  They are as black as each other, yet Hunter doesn&rsquo;t think Guerrero is really black, even though they play on the same team.</p>
<p>Hunter is right about one thing, though   &mdash;   The cheap labor economics of Dominican players.</p>
<p>As an aside, black Americans were 10.8% of all MLB players season before last, close to their proportion of the population.  Another thing to consider is that most black athletic talent steers itself toward sports other than baseball, because that&rsquo;s what they want to do.  Nobody should find it nefarious, it&rsquo;s what free men in a free country do (at least free for a little while longer, anyway).  Now, if you&rsquo;re some sort of social justice activist looking for payday, then you&rsquo;ll make an issue of it.  I&rsquo;m sure there are probably a hundred people with 100 kilobuck salaries who are charged with getting more black Americans into the MLB and baseball in general.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with the blacks on this one.  If we are going to pay people hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to hit a ball with a stick it might as well be our own home grown citizens.</p>
<p>On the other hand their is a certain evil pleasure from seeing blacks suffer from the effects of immigration and diversity.  Indians may replace us in the computer biz but Dominicans will replace them on the ball field.  When white America goes down so does black America, whether they like it or not.  We are joined at the hip.<br>

I have been an avid baseball fan (NY Mets) since I was old enough to swing a bat.  I love the game. That being said, Mr. Hunter&rsquo;s comments are foolish and hilarious.</p>
<p>As usual, Blacks want things all to themselves.  This isn&rsquo;t the first time an Af-Am MLB player has made race-based public remarks.  A few years ago, Gary Sheffield claimed that the higher number of Latinos than Blacks in the MLB was attributable to Latinos being &#8220;easier to handle&#8221; than Blacks.  He was on to something there&hellip;</p>
<p>Being an African-American isn&rsquo;t good enough, so they want a monopoly on the classification &#8220;Black people&#8221;.  But if you look at a picture of  Dominican-born players such as Jose Reyes, David Ortiz, or Guillermo Mota, it is very hard to tell whether or not they were born in the US.  Whether Mr. Hunter likes it or not, those 3 players and many others, are, in terms of color-classification, Black. </p>
<p>&ldquo;As African-American players, we have a theory that baseball can go get an imitator and pass them off as us,&rdquo; Hunter says. </p>
<p>Plain for all to see in the above quote is the sort of paranoia and perhaps inferiority complex that seems to permeate many a black mind.  Hidden forces and &#8220;the Man&#8221; are once again conspiring to short-change Blacks in some way, or so they see it.</p>
<p>As some posters noted on ESPN.com (where I have been following this story since yesterday)this ISN&rsquo;T just akin to a White American basketball player&hellip;say J.J. Redick..complaining about the paucity of Whites in the NBA.  Oh no, it goes beyond that.  This is like Redick branding the White, German-born Dirk Nowitzki or the White, Canadian-born Steve Nash as &#8220;not real Whites&hellip;just impostors&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Of course, Hunter will not even receive a slap on the wrist for his comments.  They will be swept under the rug by the MSM along with every other example of Black racism in modern society.  The madness goes on folks&hellip;</p>

<p>Apparently only blacks can tell blacks apart. Over here in the muslim wars, Sunni can identify Shia or Wahabii (Saudi) just by looking&hellip;it is how they determine whom to kill. Personally, we over here see no difference and I personally see no difference with blacks except to the extent that some are so black as to be purple and some are light chocolate tan with distinct black features&hellip;.all blacks to me though, to include the DR and most of PR.</p>

<p>This shows the you must give us a part of your venture because you owe us.He is declaring that American Blacks are not getting thier full share of Affirmative Action Recruits. Of coourse it is because the scouts are scared to go to their hoods. Never missing the fact the football and basketball scouts have no problem doing that&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Unemployed black mothers can&rsquo;t find the time to support their kids?  I live in Jersey City, N.J and am involved with Little League here.  It is very popular with 500 mostly minority kids playing.  It is by far the single most popular kids program in the City.  But ask their parents to participate and there is but disappointment.  Under employment here is very high, yet the kids&rsquo; parents don&rsquo;t show for volunteer work or even watching their kids play.  The league is dominated by white volunteers and financial supporters who supply league management and operational volunteers as well as uniforms and equipment. Just like real life.</p>

		<p>Good God the excuses.  Hilarious and sad all at once.  Tori Hunter&rsquo;s comments just scream ignorance.</p>
<p>First of all, talent scouts are told by the organizations to go find the best TALENT.  That talent hopefully will help the BUSINESS make money.  DUH!  Typical though, Hunter thinks blacks are being shunned.  No Tori, that&rsquo;s not how it works.  Scouts will go look for the best, and the best will be found.  Does he honestly think that, in the information age, scouring the third world is any easier than searching our own cities?  We send scouts down there for the sole purpose of keeping our own blacks down?  Good God!  Perpetual victims.  </p>
<p>Second, baseball talent IS NOT being developed in the black communities!  50 years ago ALL kids played baseball.  Now, very few urban kids play it.  There are SO many more opportunities today.  Malls, cell phones, video games, other sports, etc.  Go to any American urban center this summer and compare the basketball courts, the soccer fields, and baseball diamonds.  See for yourself.  Decades ago baseball was KING and the percentages of Blacks in the MLB was much higher, and they were good!  They developed the skills necessary to advance.</p>
<p>Third, go to ANY American city and ask the young Black adolecents and boys what THEY think of the game.  They will tell you its lame, slow, boring, not fun, old, white&hellip;  Then go to the Dominican or Puerto Rico and ask the same questions as you see the same age kids playing and having the time of their lives doing it.  </p>
<p>Tori, your excuses hold no water.</p>

		<p>Torii Hunter is pretty darned arrogant if he thinks that any other race&rsquo;s ultimate desire is to be African American. Dominicans, Venezuelans or Puerto Ricans have no desire to belong to Mr. Hunter&rsquo;s ethnic group. They&rsquo;re not being imposters - they simply want to play baseball and get rich, just like Hunter.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel about baseball (which I love) the same way I feel about immigration in general: there&rsquo;s no room right now for non-citizens. No one other than an American citizen should be allowed to play in American baseball leagues. Due to the foreigners&rsquo; and blacks&rsquo; virtual monopoly of the game, I no longer watch it.</p>
