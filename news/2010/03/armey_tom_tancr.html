			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Stein, Huffington Post, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the second time in as many weeks, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey  &mdash;  who has become the corporate personification of the Tea Party movement  &mdash;  verbally smacked down former Rep. Tom Tancredo, another Tea Party fixture, for his unsympathetic views on immigration reform.</p>
<p>Speaking at the National Press Club on Monday, Armey called the Colorado Republican a &#8220;destructive&#8221; force on the Republican Party and claimed that, as Majority Leader, he made sure that Tancredo &#8220;didn&rsquo;t get on a stage&#8221; to profess his hard-line views on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Republicans  &mdash;  when I was a Majority Leader  &mdash;  I saw to it that Tom Tancredo did not get on a stage because I saw how destructive he was &hellip;  Handle it with some sense of compassion and some sense of civility. The Hispanic-American is the most natural-born constituency for the Republican Party since the Black American was in 1965. And these guys are trying to blow it. Just do it right &hellip;  There is room in America. If you love America, if you love freedom, love work, are willing to pay your way, pay your taxes and obey the law, you should be welcome in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Republicans need to get it right, and get off this goofiness that they have,&#8221; Armey added. &#8220;Ronald Reagan said, &#8216;Tear down that wall.&rsquo; Tom Tancredo said, &#8216;Build that wall.&rsquo; Who&rsquo;s right? America&rsquo;s not a nation that builds walls. America&rsquo;s a nation that opens doors, and we should be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t find this story on <i>The Onion</i> ?</p>
<p>Now you know why he&rsquo;s no longer Majority Leader.</p>
<p>The HuffPo wasn&rsquo;t know how right it was when it called Armey &#8220;corporate.&#8221;  It wouldn&rsquo;t take much research to find where Armey got his campaign money, mostly from those who directly benefit from cheap Hispanic slave labor.</p>

		<p>I always believed that Armey and other corporocrats were the reason that the Republican party sold out its constituents and is becoming an irrevelancy. Now this same bunch is trying to weedle its way into the tea party movement so that it can subvert it and take back control of the country. </p>
<p>We have Obama in power today and he&rsquo;s ruining the nation in a leftward direction. If we get the Armey crowd back in they&rsquo;ll do what they did before and we&rsquo;ll have statues of George W. Bush all over the place. </p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t let the Armey crowds&rsquo; nose under the tent or its all over. They are as much an enemy of this nation and promoters of the &#8220;New World Order&#8221; as are the Obamaites on the left are proponents of Global Government. Beware.</p>

		<p>All the perpetrators of the Bush regime are trying to position themselves for a comeback.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really disappointed that there have been no mea culpas from conservatives about what a disaster Bush was for America.  I expected that once he was out of office, there would be some honest reappraisal of his administration, at least in the &#8220;serious&#8221; conservative media, like National Review(as opposed to Fox News/Limbaugh infotainment).  Instead they transitioned directly from 100% mindless Bush worship to 100% mindless Obama bashing.  </p>

<p>With people like Army in the Republican party is it any wonder they lost the presidency and both houses of Congress?</p>
<p>If the Tea Party people are smart they&rsquo;ll marginalize him tothe point where he&rsquo;ll slink off on his own without being kicked out physically.</p>
<p>The main platform of the Tea Party is immigration.  Does this fool realize that?  Apparently not, because it appears he&rsquo;s trying to co-opt the movement for the Republicans.  </p>
<p>Somebody tell this fool he&rsquo;s bragging about being stupid.</p>

		<p>I am with #1 Question Diversity, and #2 Anonymous, all the way on Dick Armey. I remember listening to a radio talk show some nine or ten years ago, in which Armey was being interviewed. He babbled about the minimum wage and what a good thing it is for people. He went on to say that he worked for less when he was a &#8220;youth&#8221; and it helps to build character,etc. Of course what Mr. Corporate shill, Dick Armey, forgot to mention about the time of his youth, was that one could buy a rather large bag of groceries for a buck. If a kid had a dime and a quarter in his pocket during the thirties, forties, fifties, and even much of the sixties, he felt rich because of all he could buy.</p>
<p>Now it transpires that Dick Armey isn&rsquo;t for the minimum wage at all. He&rsquo;s for corporate slave labor. His mouthing off on the virtues of illegal immigration proves that. I sometimes wonder if the average American citizen, in groups like the Tea Party, Democrat Party, Republican Party, really comprehend what kind of vile, useless,   &mdash;    &mdash;  - we have in this country that claim to be working for Americans &#8220;best interests&#8221;, when in reality, people like Dick Armey and so many other politicos, make the great industrialist robber barons of the eighteen hundreds look like kind, altruistic people. In many ways the original Robber Barons turned out to be just that, by creating a new middle class  &mdash;  a far cry from the super rich,&#8221;cheap labor&#8221; type we have today. </p>

		<p>Someone needs to explain to Dick Armey the difference between the Berlin Wall and the border fence.  Berliners weren&rsquo;t exactly clamoring to get into the Communist nightmare being foisted upon their cousins who were so unfortunate as to be on the wrong side of a line drawn by the victors while they divided the spoils.</p>
<p>Sorry Dick, but the Berlin Wall was thrown up by the Soviets to keep people IN.  The border fence is intended to keep people OUT.  Don&rsquo;t try and invoke the memory of Mr. Amnesty &#8220;Conservative&#8221; himself to trick the masses into supporting your efforts to make the Republicans into leftist-lite.</p>

<p> &#8221; &ldquo;Ronald Reagan said, &lsquo;Tear down that wall.&rsquo; Tom Tancredo said, &lsquo;Build that wall.&rsquo; Who&rsquo;s right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone please inform Mr. Armey that both Reagan and Tancredo were/are correct.  Reagan, with the goal of rejoining a strong nation and bringing freedom to millions, and Tancredo, with the goal of maintaining a strong nation and keeping millions free from the balkanizing death and destruction brought on by multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s a nation that opens doors, and we should be there&#8221;</p>

		<p>Dick Armey is exhibit A in the argument for why the Republicans are no better than the Democrats.  While I don&rsquo;t like the way Tancredo is aligned with the neocons on the forever war thing, he was the best man congress had on the immigration issue.</p>
<p>Armey was unintentionally correct when he said, &#8220;The Hispanic-American is the most natural-born constituency for the Republican Party since the Black American was in 1965.&#8221;  How many blacks voted for McCain in 2008?  Not even Colin Powell did.  Even when the Democratic candidate for an office is white he can realistically expect to get about 80% of the black vote.  Republicans can expect about the same percentage of votes from Hispanics as they currently get from blacks after they hand Democrats their dream of amnesty.  In fact, even though McCain is just as much in favor of illegal alien amnesty as Obama, <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1024/exit-poll-analysis-hispanics" rel="nofollow">more than 2/3rds of Hispanics voted for Obama.</a></p>
<p>The diversity wants hand outs, paid for by predominately white tax payers.  Republicans will never win at that game.<br>

		<p>The Hispanic vote will never be a GOP vote.</p>
<p>Bush and McCain did everything to help Hispanics hoping they would get the Spanish vote and they didn&rsquo;t.  McCain backed amnesty and he received less of the Hispanic vote than Bush.  Both candidates courted the Hispanic vote at the expense of the White Voter and McCain lost both groups.  Now the country club GOPers will try to repeat their feat again.</p>

<p>The only one among the crowd you mention or allude to that has come out substantially against the Bush 43 Presidency is Michelle Malkin.  When some people put up billboards with a pic of Bush 43 and the words &#8220;Miss Me Yet?,&#8221; she wrote a blog post giving a dozen reasons why she doesn&rsquo;t miss him, and I agreed with eleven and a half of them.  I could have given you those and eight dozen more reasons.</p>
<p>One could also add the talk radio host born Michael Weiner, but he wasn&rsquo;t way too fond of Bush while Bush was President, justifiably IMHO.</p>

Lindsey Graham and John McCain being cheered on by a huge faux tea party rent a crowd?  If we don&rsquo;t keep vigilant the neocons will end up co-opting this movement and making it just another arm of the Republican Party.</p>

Sadly though, I haven&rsquo;t heard the Tea Party say much about the massive illegal immigration destroying our country. I think immigration is an issue it needs to address, and fast, if i wants to keep and increase its momentum. Every American who is capable of rational thought is against rampant illegal immigration. </p>

		<p>Someone needs to inform this clueless idiot that Republicans like him are one of the REASONS the tea parties were formed in the first place. Him and Newt Gingrich, Carl Rove, John McCain and others were\are the &#8220;distructive force&#8221; on the GOP. They are trying to slime their way into the tea parties so they can destroy them from within in my opinion. I would hope that the tea party movement will keep these trojan dinosaurs &#8220;off the stage&#8221; so they can&rsquo;t spew their limp wristed views on immigration. When they try to show their faces at these gatherings, they should be shouted down and outed for who they REALLY are.</p>

		<p>This is the reason (among many others) that so many conservatives hate the Republican Party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s times like these that I really wish we had a proportional, multi-party, coalition-based political system. That way, real conservatives could create their own party without ensuring that the Democrats win because they &#8220;threw away&#8221; their vote on an irrelevant third party.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hispanic-American is the most natural-born constituency for the Republican Party since the Black American was in 1965.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Utterly amazing that even someone as obtuse as Dick Armey would say this. I don&rsquo;t know offhand what percentage of Black Americans voted Republican back around 1965, but I do know it was more than the negligible FIVE PERCENT that voted for McCain in 2008. </p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to bet that a larger proportion of Hispanic-Americans were Republicans in &#8216;65 than today, too! </p>

<p>When Republicans win, the business/neocon lobby takes credit. Then they do all the damage. Then they blame the social/traditional conservatives for their screw-ups and defeat.</p>

The Republican leaders have no long range objectives; they plan no farther than the next election. They have no principles, not even bad ones. Liberals have a motive to vote for Democrats; only the rich or foolish have any motive to support the Republican party.</p>

<p>Well, Comrade Armey, did you ever also hear the ominous challenge President Ronald Reagan  made to critics and traitors, about not destroying the alien invasion of &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; brown criminals and terrorists, that went something like this: &lsquo;A country that cannot defend its borders, is no longer a country&hellip;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Comrade Armey, you are just such a traitor and multicultural terrorism advocate: no guts, no brains, no gonads, and certainly no benedictions. </p>
<p>You in short, are a grindhouse gutter&rsquo;s satyr on display!</p>

		<p>The majority of Americans want to stop illegal immigration and oppose amnesty. This has been the case for about 30 years now.</p>
<p>And yet somehow, the left has taken hold of the debate to the extent that for someone to champion a very open and direct anti-illegal immigration view, like Tancredo has, is to be publicly branded a racist and a fringe element.</p>
<p>Rather than fall in line with the left&rsquo;s framing of the debate, so-called leaders like Armey should be defying the stranglehold on free thought and discourse and make the majority&rsquo;s case loudly and boldly. It&rsquo;s not an easy or clean issue to debate - but the numbers are there - a clear majority is there to send the mexicans home. There&rsquo;s just no leader to lead the charge. And so we&rsquo;ll likely end up with yet another amnesty&hellip;</p>

		<p>Armey should know about &#8220;destructive forces&#8221; being one himself. Roy Beck of NumbersUSA reports Armey&rsquo;s adamant support of open borders. Armey says, &#8220;America&rsquo;s not a nation that builds walls. America&rsquo;s a nation that opens doors, and we should be there.&#8221; One supposes that Armey really believes that a wall to prevent alien invaders is equal to the Berlin Wall which trapped people behind the Iron Curtain! Through his support of Americans for Border and Economic Security he sought to raise money for George Bush&rsquo;s immigration agenda. <br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t put ANY faith the the tea party &#8220;movement&#8221;.  It is already co-opted and will accomplish NOTHING.</p>
<p>FreedomWorks had the resources to break the Tea Parties big. It began in 1984 as part of Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group financed by libertarian oil magnate David Koch &mdash; also one of the wallets behind the Cato Institute. In 2004, CSE split, with one faction becoming Americans for Prosperity (another Tea Party organizer) and the other merging with the Bill Bennett-Jack Kemp policy shop Empower America to become FreedomWorks. Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey was brought in as chairman, with an annual salary in excess of $550,000; Steve Forbes serves on the board of the group, which commands a budget in the $8 million range and claims 860,000 members. As the outcry rose, Steinhauser made himself a kind of switchboard operator, connecting activists to each other and arranging lessons in how to get permits. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very Saul Alinsky,&rdquo; he says of FreedomWorks&rsquo; role.</p>

		<p><i>the Republican Party is the most naturally talented party at losing its natural constituents in the history of the world.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>They certainly are!  They&rsquo;re losing their only constituents by committing genocide-through-colonialism against them.  </p>
<p><i> The Hispanic-American is the most natural-born constituency for the Republican Party since the Black American was in 1965&hellip; If you love America, if you love freedom, love work, are willing to pay your way, pay your taxes and obey the law, you should be welcome in America.</i></p>
<p>People on the right do the nation no favors when they claim that Republicans support mass immigration because they want cheap labor,  labor has almost nothing to do with it.   They support unlimited immigration because they are afraid of being called racist by the media.    The delusional nature of the first part of the quote above speaks for itself.   In the last part Armey PRETENDS not to understand that there are at least 2 or 3 billion third-worlders who want to come to this country,  he pretends not to believe that even the present level of the flood will have massive social, political, cultural, and environmental impact on the nation.  It&rsquo;s important to emphasize the unreality of Armey&rsquo;s sentiments, the complete disconnect between his statements and the practical effects of his immigration beliefs, and indeed the lack of  any discussion of practical effects,  because it indicates the reality that Republican support for the invasion is not a matter of economics,  it&rsquo;s a matter of political correctness.   Immigration policy and the rococo public-speak around it is strictly about race.  <i>this is a nation of immigrants</i>  is code-phrase for &#8220;we&rsquo;re not a white nation and shouldn&rsquo;t be.&#8221;    The crooks at the top of the Republican Party and the Conservative movement believe pretty much what the supporters of this site believe on multi-racialism,  they understand that it means the end of the nation and civilization, they are simply collaborating with the culturally dominant Left for profits.  All that matters to the Armeys of this world is that they be given access to the system in order to service their rich clients.    The real &#8220;natural constituents&#8221; of the Republican party are they only ones they never try to serve, and that tells you who&rsquo;s in control and what the game is. </p>
<p>Immigration policies in the West are about committing genocide against white people.   The Democrats and Liberals are obsessed with a one-eyed fanaticism about this goal.   They too betray their alleged principles in the quest to obtain it.   They don&rsquo;t care what sort of society mass immigration produces.  They don&rsquo;t care if it reduces everyone to poverty,  if it ruins the environment,  it it diminishes personal freedom, if it produces violence,  or if it destroys the economic prosperity that their programs rest on,  they don&rsquo;t care if the nations of Europe adopt sharia law, they&rsquo;ll support mass immigration to the bitter end.    The goal is the dispossession and eventual elimination of whites, period.   Immigration is a hate-motivated policy of genocide,  and anyone who clouds that reality is helping it.  <br>

		<p>Immigration is a tax on the working poor. I guess according to Armey that just helps build their character.<br>
 I am a reluctant Democrat amazed at the stupidity of Republicans. Immigration is THE ISSUE.<br>
It covers Jobs, Environment, National security, Education, Health Care, and the social cohesion of our communities.<br>
 Even immigrants do not like massive immigration. WAKE UP AMERICA you are being replaced by a new electorate of immigrants. Immigration is only favored by those that benefit from it, expose them all and start voting for your own self interest before diversity and multiculturalism ethnically cleans you out!</p>

		<p>The real issue isn&rsquo;t immigration so much as it is socialism.</p>
<p>Put another way.  When has the US ever had a standing military on our border to keep mexicans (and others mixed in with them) out?  Never, you say.</p>
<p>Yet the mass influx of immigrants, legal and illegal is a recent thing.  The US was firmly a white nation, until recently, despite sharing a border with a corrupt, impoverished nation, for centuries.</p>
<p>Also, when has the US checked legal status formally and often?  That would be never.  I remember back during Reagan&rsquo;s time when people were all upset that they now had to provide identity documents as part of the deal for amnesty.  The idea being that it would dissuade new illegals by cutting off jobs.</p>
<p>Did that work?  Nope.  That&rsquo;s because third world immigration has never been about jobs nor about enforcement.  People of different races rarely choose to move to communities dominated by a race other than their own.  And when they do&hellip;.they hate living there.</p>
<p>And these races we are talking about are not particularly interested in working for a living&hellip;.despite all the propaganda about picking oranges for 10 cents an hour.</p>
<p>No&hellip;..what these people come for is the welfare.  Also, a troublesome minority of them come to make money off of other people who get welfare (ie to run drugs, prostitution and the criminal syndicates and gangs that support these).  Jose, the orange picker isn&rsquo;t really interested in the 10 cent an hour wage.  And few bother to even get a token job when they come here.  What they are after is all the welfare goodies and freebies being given out&hellip;.especially free medical care.  From food stamps to a posh place to live for free, to the luxury of having their baby born in a hospital, that is the reason, the ONLY reason immigrants come to both the US and europe.</p>
<p>That is why, as welfare grew, their numbers grew, despite no restrictions of any real substance for the history of our country. Non-white immigration mirrors their access to welfare.</p>
<p>Socialism is the problem and its dismantlement is the solution.  Amnesty is irrelevant.  In fact, I predict that if amnesty were passed, like with the recent amnesty given to haitians, few would choose to take advantage of it.  The real issue is welfare.  If tomorrow morning, we woke up and all government money was reserved for whites only, within hours, we would have tens of millions of spanish speaking people walking back over the border.  After a few weeks of rioting, you&rsquo;d probably see a significant number of blacks leaving as well.</p>
<p>Now, that is not going to happen.  At least not by choice (if the economy collapses followed by a collapse of the welfare system, it WILL happen, VERY quickly).  But, with the right choices, Americans can make something very similar happen over a period of time, and gain almost no notice or resistance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about Ron Paul and his desire to dismantle socialism slowly, over time, by gradually reducing welfare (and dramatically decreasing &#8220;foriegn aid&#8221; immediately).  This, more than anything, would reduce immigrants of all types.  They DO NOT want to live here.  As their welfare dries up, they will leave.</p>
<p>Understand that it is already happening.  As money gets tight, states have cut services.  Usually mentioned only in passing (and usually lack of jobs is blamed although few of these people ever had jobs&hellip;.cough) is the fact that 2 million or so immigrants left this country this year as the amount of welfare they got was reduced.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, that is the real reason Obama is so hot to pass healthcare.  He, and the rest of those trying to destroy white america, know all this (and if they know it&hellip;.why don&rsquo;t racially aware whites).  They are desperately seeking some way to earmark substantial welfare for decades to come in order to keep these people from leaving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand this and to fight against it.  Not allowing Obamacare to pass would be a major blow to the multiculturalists.  So would cutting off amnesty.  Not because amnesty really matters but it would draw into public awareness to people on both side of the border that immigrants are not welcome here.  And unwelcome people find their services cut off.</p>
<p>A much similar situation is going on in europe and for the same reasons.  Unfortunately, they don&rsquo;t have much power to put a stop to it.  We do.</p>
<p>Take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Libertarianism in this hideous anti White form is the only type of &#8220;conservatism&#8221; allowed on PC campuses and this open borders immigration, Libertarianism is the only type of &#8220;conservative&#8221; position that allows rich, fat White men to keep their jobs in politics, media, corporate world. </p>

		<p> Armey/McCain/Gingrich and all the other RINO/neocons are NOT what the Tea Party movement is about. Because I&rsquo;ve seen that the Repubs are just as likely to rape the American public as the Dems. I registered as an Independent two years ago, after many years as a Republican. The Tea Party is about taking America back and making it a republic again. We will not let tax loving rights trampling RINOs ride on our coattails. The RINOs hate congressmen like Tancredo and Ron Paul because they speak the ugly truth about where we are as a nation and how we got here, as well as what we need to do to fix it. The American public is finally waking up to how long we&rsquo;ve been bent over the proverbial barrel, and is in a mood to do some serious house (and senate) cleaning. That scares the heck out of the majority of our rotten Congress. </p>

<p>Nothing short of openly racial white identity politics is going to save us at this point.  We need to build an explicitly racial political movement that can actually take power and give up on the GOP, libertarianism etc.  </p>

<p>Ron Paul will dismantle the welfare state and make it very difficult for freeloaders to come into this country.  He will reduce every level of government and get rid of useless and wasteful federal departments like education, interior, energy and homeland security.  Ron Paul will reduce the bloated military budget, close most of the overseas bases and get us out of the foreign entanglements we fight for our &#8220;ally&#8221;.  Ron Paul will reinstate our freedom of association, our freedom of choice, end affirmative action and abolish the Federal Reserve.  If this isn&rsquo;t a blueprint for the survival of European America then I don&rsquo;t know what is.  Of course, some people would be more than happy to choose someone who&rsquo;ll maintain the status quo.  Someone who&rsquo;s stupid and malleable like Sarah Palin who on one hand talks about being proud to be an American while swearing her allegiance to foreign powers and the &#8220;wars forever&#8221; club.  Someone who can be easily controlled and manipulated by shadowy demons bent on establishing a global order. </p>

		<p>Area Tea Partiers aware that Dick Armey is nothing but a bought and paid for establishment man that is involved with them for no other reason than to manipulate them[Tea Partiers] for the establishment that he [Armey] works for. It saddens me, I see the Tea Party being composed of a mixture of different kinds of conservatives with different leanings. The Christian conservative element will relate to Armey and feel like he&rsquo;s one of their own when in fact he is a fake Tea Partier involved in the hijacking of the movement by the powers that be. I find it amazing that anyone would look at Dick Armey and think of him as an ally except for the crooked pirates that inhabit Washington. The Tea Party is supposed to be a movement of action and not hot air in place of it. It is supposed to be a movement of real action and not endless debate and talk which ends up leading nowhere. </p>

ATBOTL is right. While welfare and other benefits are undoubtedly a strong lure to many, that&rsquo;s not really what it&rsquo;s all about.  I have known, personally, several Mexicans and at least a couple of Colombians who came here for personal reasons which had nothing to do with welfare.</p>
<p>All, however, were taking advantage of America (and Uncle Sam&rsquo;s patience) in other ways. (The USA is a place where you can get away with an awful lot that would never be allowed back home!)</p>

		<p>Bud is correct. The immigration mess, legal and illegal, was created to destroy whites. That was the goal of the true authors, of which Teddy K was NOT, despite MSM propaganda now used to try and keep people&rsquo;s attention on dearly departed fatso and off the guilty parties. </p>
<p>Question Diversity mentions Michelle Malkin and Michael Savage, but at their best they are a couple of neocon mouthpieces, certainly not friends of whites. </p>
<p>Dick Armey is telling the truth. Considering TODAY&rsquo;S Republican party, &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are a natural born constituency. Whites certainly are not, even though too many still don&rsquo;t realize it. Both parties were taken over by the anti-white crowd decades ago, just as the various tea party groups are under that same pressure now. You know you&rsquo;re doing it right when you&rsquo;re openly pro-white and called &#8220;racist&#8221;. That&rsquo;s just how it is today.Because we&rsquo;re fighting the real racists. Everything negative our enemies claim about us is merely them projecting what they&rsquo;ve already done to others, and will do to us if they gain the control they crave. </p>
<p>ATBOTL is not quite correct. If we didn&rsquo;t have policies that favored non-whites, the mexicans wouldn&rsquo;t be so keen on coming here. They are fully aware they are favored over the gueros (whites) when it comes to jobs and everything else. Illegal immigration is a far more orchestrated &#8220;process&#8221; than most people would like to believe. &#8220;Your government&#8221; is waging open warfare against whites. That&rsquo;s it. </p>
