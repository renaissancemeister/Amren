<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/nyregion/20parole.html">Killer of Malcolm X Is Granted Parole</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Newman and John Eligon, New York Times, March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas Hagan has been held since moments after shots rang out in the Audubon Ballroom in 1965. He has been on work release for more than two decades, but he still spends two days a week locked up at the Lincoln Correctional Facility on West 110th Street in Manhattan.</p>
<p>{snip} His final release date is tentatively scheduled for April 28. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Hagan said in a 1977 affidavit that he and several accomplices {snip} decided to kill Malcolm X because he was a &#8220;hypocrite&#8221; who had &#8220;gone against the leader of the Nation of Islam,&#8221; Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Hagan said that after one man shot Malcolm X in the chest with a shotgun, he and another man fired several more rounds at him.</p>

		<p>Funny, to hear it today, you would think that Mr. X was some great civil rights martyr.  They want us to halfway believe that some white person with links to the hood group or something similar assassinated Mr. X, when it was nothing more than an intranicene squabble among radical blacks.  Ironically, the faction of the NOI that the killers came from got upset with X when he saw all the non-blacks in a pilgrimage to Mecca, which caused X to backtrack on his black ethnocentrism a bit.  So while they were telling us to enact civil rights laws to respect multi-racialism, they killed Malcolm X for his &#8220;lack&#8221; of racial rectitude.</p>

		<p>Two days a week in jail for first degree premeditated murder?  Has spent two decades out on work release, amomg the rest of us?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who he killed this is a disgrace.  What kind of punishment is this for murder?  Shouldn&rsquo;t first degree murder mean confinement for LIFE?</p>

		<p>Well, he did his time for the crime   &mdash;   why not let him out?  I don&rsquo;t see any problem with it.  If he gets into more trouble on the outside, they&rsquo;ll catch him and put him back in the slammer.  It&rsquo;s nothing new - happens every day.  I live near prisons in Chino, CA and thereabouts, and truly, this is not unusual.  What IS unusual is if a felon manages to stay out of trouble when they get out.  That doesn&rsquo;t happen very often.</p>

		<p>The original article states that one of the three men who shot Malcolm X was given a job by Louis Farrakhan after being paroled.</p>
<p>Very interesting, considering the longstanding rumors that these guys were acting upon orders from Farrakhan and/or Elijah Muhammed.</p>

		</legend>
		<p>See?  A white racist justice system is keeping a man in prison since 1965 for murdering a black racist man who hated whites and the United States.  Did you get that?  Racist White America spent 45 years keeping a man imprisoned who murdered another black man who said whites were the devil.  Yep.  Clearly another example of how racist whites are.</p>

		<p>Right, this guy has been in prison for a very long time and the whole time HAS NEVER SPOKEN A WORD ABOUT THE CRIME!</p>
<p>A lot of questions have always been asked froma variety of sources about IF the top brass of the Black Muslims authorized the &#8220;hit&#8221; on Malcolm Little [X]. </p>
<p>If anyone knows it is this man and he says NOTHING!! Long time to take the fall for someone else, if that was the case. He did pull the trigger, but the word to do so came from others?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. Because it always just says &#8216;he was assassinated&rsquo; and often in the group of the kennedys and MLK. Frankly, that&rsquo;s what I grew up believing, that he was murdered by whites.</p>

		<p>Whether Mr. Hagan pulled the trigger or not. God can only judge him now, not us. I think he should be let alone to live the rest of his life. If we bring our self imposed justice on this man, we are no better than he is.</p>

Personnally, I am quite convinced that it was Louis Farrakhan who gave the order to those guys to kill Malcolm X.</p>

		<p>@10 Whether or not &#8220;god&#8221; judges him is none of our business. Wanting other races to stay out of our business necessarily requires that we stay out of there&rsquo;s.</p>
