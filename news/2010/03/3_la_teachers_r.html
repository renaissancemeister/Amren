<h1>3 LA Teachers Removed Over Choice of Black Heroes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Hoag, Google News, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three Los Angeles elementary school teachers accused of giving children portraits of O.J. Simpson, Dennis Rodman and RuPaul to carry in a Black History Month parade have been removed from their classrooms, a school district spokeswoman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Children from other classes at the school displayed photos of more appropriate black role models, such as Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman and President Barack Obama, Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman Gayle Pollard-Terry said.</p>
<p>The incident occurred Friday at Wadsworth Avenue Elementary School in South Los Angeles, where the student body is more than 90 percent Latino.</p>
<p>District Superintendent Ramon Cortines placed the teachers  &mdash;  all white men who teach first, second and fourth grades  &mdash;  on administrative leave on Tuesday while an investigation is conducted, Pollard-Terry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The superintendent will not let anyone make a mockery out of Black History Month,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The issue was brought to district officials&rsquo; attention by the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP after the organization received a complaint early Monday, chapter President Leon Jenkins said.</p>
<p>Jenkins said he felt the teachers acted in concert to mock black heroes and children&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some parents at the school on Wednesday said the issue was overblown.</p>
<p>Sharon Tinson, who has two daughters at the school and attended Friday&rsquo;s celebration, said she had been surprised to see Simpson displayed in the parade. But she noted that Simpson, like Rodman, was a great athlete before falling from grace. RuPaul simply has an alternative lifestyle, she added.</p>
<p>She noted the event also included a tribute to pop singer Michael Jackson, who has also had a checkered career.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gabriel Blackson, whose son attends the school, said {snip}, &#8220;These guys were heroes before. People make mistakes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think they show kids they can be somebody, to push them to be somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins said he is calling for the teachers to be fired.<br>

		<p>Ahahahaha!  That&rsquo;s great.  What&rsquo;s even funnier, in a sick sort of way, is this:</p>
<p>Sharon Tinson, who has two daughters at the school and attended Friday&rsquo;s celebration, said she had been surprised to see Simpson displayed in the parade. But she noted that Simpson, like Rodman, was a great athlete before falling from grace.</p>
<p>She noted the event also included a tribute to pop singer Michael Jackson, who has also had a checkered career.</p>
<p>Gabriel Blackson, whose son attends the school, said {snip}, &ldquo;These guys were heroes before. People make mistakes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think they show kids they can be somebody, to push them to be somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some blacks are just fine with it, because hey, Simpson and Jackson are still role models!  Murderers and child rapists are just fine in Black Land if they were athletes or singers!  Looks like the joke is on us, I guess.</p>

		<p>O. J. Simpson was a hero to the black community when he brutally killed his White wife and beat the murder rap with the help of a mostly black jury.  Does this mean they now believe he was guilty or is the flack over that armed robbery job he did? </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t remember who RuPaul was and looked her up.  She&rsquo;s a singer/actress who&rsquo;s appeared in a few films including the role of the school counselor in the &#8220;Brady Bunch Movie&#8221;.  I don&rsquo;t understand all the uproar in the black community over this.  She&rsquo;s not the best actress around but she does have a sort of feminine charm that&rsquo;s largely absent in black female roles.  Little black girls would do well to emulate her and look upon her as a role model.  </p>

<p>Well Comrade Cortines, you had better be prepared to take on the entire multicultural establishment of the United States, since they allow for a &ldquo;Black History Month&rdquo; which is a mockery of the most acute double entendre against sanity in human history. After all, &ldquo;appropriate black role models, such as Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman and President Barack Obama,&rdquo; all promote or have promoted physical integration of whites and blacks, and with it genocide of the white race, have they not? That is to say nothing of the mulatto &ldquo;saint&rdquo; and satyr, that is Tiger Woods. </p>
<p>O.J. Simpson, Dennis Rodman, and RuPaul are only minor digressions of such &ldquo;wisdoms&rdquo; and whimsies; I am sure that even Comrade King, in his most honest of moments, would have been hard-pressed to disagree with that.</p>
<p>To say nothing of such &ldquo;country&rdquo; Reds as Brad Paisley: </p>

<p>Where the teachers really white or were they Latino?<br>
When Latinos commit crimes they get classified by the FBI as white.</p>
<p>There is probably some resentment teaching black history to a 90 percent Latino student body.  Would a 90 percent black student body spend a month learning about Latino history?</p>

<p>Yes, all heroes have a tendency to murder the very woman that bore his children and then murder an innocent, regular guy who was nice enough to come over and drop off some sunglasses that the hero&rsquo;s ex-wife left at the restaurant. Typical of blacks. Always making excuses for murders and criminals. They&rsquo;re certainly not forgiving towards whites that they percieved to have done them wrong.</p>

<p>A few years ago, PBS did a Frontline documentary about the OJ verdict and black reaction.  While they did say that blacks were jubilant at the outset, they tried to use the lame excuse that black reaction today, more than a decade after the fact, is more mixed and nuanced, and they interviewed customers and barbers in a black barbershop in South Central Los Angeles to that effect.</p>
<p>Yeah, so?  Are we supposed to be impressed?  I&rsquo;m sure there were a lot of white people battered and assaulted on the day of that black jubilance right after the verdict.  Did those wounds suddenly disappear that black reaction is &#8220;mixed&#8221; today?  The show referenced the 1992 riots, and said that black reaction about the conditions that caused the riots are &#8220;mixed.&#8221;  Does this mean that Reginald Denny&rsquo;s brain damage that inhibits his ability to work, such that he has to eke out an existence fixing boats in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, all of a sudden has gone away?  </p>
<p>I guess Frontline thought we&rsquo;d all be impressed with the sudden sophistication of the black body politic, such as it is.  But all that does is prove what most of us at AR have been saying all along   &mdash;   This isn&rsquo;t an example of their intellect, it proves their impulsive nature.  Someone that smart wouldn&rsquo;t wait to have mixed reaction to a jury verdict a decade after the fact, it would have had it at the moment it happened, such that they wouldn&rsquo;t go out and beat a white truck driver into a state of near death, and into a state of &#8220;living&#8221; that&rsquo;s barely better than out and outright death.</p>

		<p>I would think that O.J. is a great example of a black hero. Maybe they&rsquo;ve forgotten that he heroically overcame the white man&rsquo;s biased &#8220;justice&#8221; system   &mdash;   which we all know is operated for the sole purpose of persecuting minorities.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the saddest part of all this is the fact that these choices aren&rsquo;t that much worse than the other so-called &#8220;prominent&#8221; blacks in history. </p>
<p>Back in February, my nephew (grade 5) brought home a paper displaying a number of purportedly &#8220;exceptional&#8221; &#8220;blacks&#8221;. I use &#8220;blacks&#8221; in quotation marks because half of these people were actors or singers that were half-white. </p>
<p>Besides that, there were a number of black athletes, entertainers and other not-so-worthys listed. It&rsquo;s truly a sad state of affairs when celebrities, that are usually chosen for their blackness in the first place, are some of the only ones that your race can choose as historical role models. </p>
<p>I was very proud of my nephew after he brought this home. The first thing he asked me was, &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t we ever learn about the great things that white people have done? Why is Tiger Woods on this? He just cheated on his wife with a bunch of women. Besides, why is being a golfer so important for us to learn?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yup, he&rsquo;s a pretty bright kid.</p>

<p><br>
Notice how they slipped in Mandela as an &#8220;appropriate&#8221; role model?  Mandela was a terrorist before he was thrown in prison.  His political career afterward consists of little more than advocating the extermination of whites.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  Here he is singing a song about killing whitey.</p>

<p><br>
So true.  He became a bigger hero to Blacks after he was acquitted, i.e., got away with murdering 2 Whites.  Blacks are much bigger heroes to other Blacks AFTER they&rsquo;ve killed a White person or two, or three AND gotten away with it.</p>

		<p>What the heck is wrong with these Whites?  Don&rsquo;t they have the least bit of racial identity?  Why even give any portraits of any Blacks to Black children.  Let their own people provide them with role models if they want to.  In their foolish eagerness to &#8220;go along to get along&#8221; they do something ridiculous and then they pay the price for it.  </p>

<p>You must be very young.</p>
<p>RuPaul was a VERY famous Drag Queen in the 80s  &mdash;  and you&rsquo;re certainly correct HE does look better, is more feminine and has more charm than most black women!</p>
<p>Maybe the school was playing one of RuPaul&rsquo;s songs such as &#8216;Sex Freak&rsquo; or &#8216;Ho, Ho, Ho&rsquo; over the loud speakers. </p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see a problem with the kiddies parading a picture of RuPaul around the school in the name of &#8216;black role models&rsquo;  &mdash;  hope it&rsquo;s this one:</p>

<p>My advice to the white men is to NEVER admit this was a prank. You three must insist that you were dead serious when you chose these three candidates.</p>
<p>Put the liberals on the defensive by demanding to know what&rsquo;s wrong w/honoring the cross-dressers Rodman and RuPaul. Accuse the school administrators of being antigay.</p>
<p>As for OJ, point out that he was acquitted. Are these &#8220;racists&#8221; challenging the wisdom of the black jury who let him go?</p>

		<p>Much is said about the guilt or innocence of O.J. and personally I couldn&rsquo;t care less, but there was a precedent set there that seems to have escaped most people&rsquo;s notice. A jury found him innocent INNOCENT! and it should have ended there, GUILTY OR INNOCENT, it should have ended there. But noooooooooo some other legal chicanary was devised to ruin him and those tricks can now be used against any one of us in the pursuit of racissssss hate speech/laws/actions. </p>

		<p>The more blacks get angry and defensive about their &#8220;heroes&#8221; and their &#8220;holidays,&#8221; i.e. the more they are unable to laugh at themselves, the more they demonstrate their general immaturity as human beings to the rest of the world.  I personally think RuPaul is the most beautiful drag queen I have EVER seen; that, like it or not, is an art, and he is the best.  The whites who get all self-righteous about defending the blacks&rsquo; anger make themselves look even more immature and simple-minded than the blacks themselves.  Hopefully, all these folks will grow up some day.  Until then, they&rsquo;re going to have an uncomfortable time of it.</p>

<p>Be suspicious and observe carefully all actions of that race of people, and stand aside, negate all involvement if possible.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Children from other classes at the school displayed photos of more appropriate black role models, such as Nelson Mandela, Harriet Tubman and President Barack Obama&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela - a terrorist.  Harriet Tubman - perhaps a worthy role model but it&rsquo;s time they move on from slavery. Barack Obama - an affirmative action beneficiary who is a bald-faced liar.  These are considered &#8220;more appropriate&#8221;.  I think it would be best for black children to look up to REAL heroes regardless of race.  Forcing them to see skin color as their defining characteristic while, at the same time, prohibiting whites from even acknowledging they have any worthy heritage at all, is a recipe for hate and violence.</p>

		<p>OJ and Rodman are definitely heroes to many blacks, and cross-dresser RuPaul probably is to many gay blacks.  Blacks almost always defend one of their own, often to the point of absurdity.  <br>

		<p>As a New Englander, my favourite Black American that twists up liberals is Louis Temple. Yeah, almost no one has heard of him. He was a manumitted slave (his owner granted his freedom,) who moved to Massachusetts from the South.</p>
<p>He was a skilled blacksmith and ironworker, and in 1848 he invented the toggle-head harpoon. The head swivels once stabbed into the whale so it holds fast for the ensuing &#8216;Nantucket Sleighride.&rsquo; The holding strength was much improved compared to fixed-barb designs, and doubled the productivity of the US whaling fleets.</p>
<p>Whaling was a traditional, wholesome, American activity for over a century, supporting not only lighting and lubrication with oils, but also bone for corsets, crafts such as scrimshaw, and as competitive material wherever ivory was used.</p>
<p>Whales are mammals and grilled whale muscle is red and delicious as any steak. You can annoy enviro-whackjobs by mentioning Louis Temple as a noteworthy Black American.</p>

		<p>Nelson Mandela. That says it all doesn&rsquo;t it? If you really want a window into the way black people think about race, that&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p>
<p>Mandela isn&rsquo;t an American, so his pick in a celebration of American Black &#8220;Achievement&#8221; is an affirmation that to black people, race is more important than citizenship.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a positive trait they are showing. Belief in what is real, rather than what is constructed by law. If only whites had this reason in matters of race.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the outrage of a European who lived in Europe being chosen at a &#8220;White History Month&#8221; as an example of White Achievement?</p>

		<p>Typical.  Blacks cheered when O.J. beat the rap, but on this day they feel his image was used as a mockery.  Why the contridiction?  Simple.  It&rsquo;s simply whatever suits them that day when its time to race hustle.  We all know you can&rsquo;t win with them.  They always want it both ways.  They hate the white man, yet think shoving Black history month in his face will cure him of his wickedness.  I got a better idea.  You don&rsquo;t like me?  Then, please, at all costs, leave me alone.  My ancestry commited NONE of the gripes you have against the white man, ZERO.  I don&rsquo;t shove my history in your face.  Yet every Feb. there it is &#8220;here&rsquo;s our history, our plight is your fault, now repent!&#8221;  Dream on!</p>

<p>As for whackjobs, calling the old (or present) whaling trade<br>
&#8220;wholesome&#8221; is quite a stretch.  It was a dangerous and dirty, and amounted to slavery for most of the crew.  That is why so many of the crews were black and Amreinds.  Also, early whaling promoted by practice - integration.  It seems big business has its uses for workers of all stripes.  It only likes to set them against one another when they strike for a union or decent working conditions.</p>

		<p>While I don&rsquo;t really see the need to go out of my way to mock Black History Month, it&rsquo;s hard not to chuckle at this story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m chuckling not because I&rsquo;m interested in ticking off blacks or hurting their feelings - to me, this sort of pranking is a natural consequence, a natural response to the sort of heavy-handed political and cultural indoctrination that&rsquo;s sadly all too pervasive in public schools these days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the political message or how well-intentioned it is - attempts at social engineering by the in-group currently in power, using elementary school aged kids as test subjects in &#8220;shaping attitudes&#8221; should be OUT OF BOUNDS. Keep the political indoctrination out of the public schools. It&rsquo;s that simple. Sadly, it also seems impossible.</p>

		<p>From &#8216;lefty&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;If only we knew what the black man who invented open-heart surgery looked like!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought you were being sarcastic when I read this but now I realize you are serious.</p>
<p>I looked up your contention on Wikipedia  &mdash;  not known for being conservative or pro-White in any way, and in fact,  frequently the opposite, as Nicholas Stix points out.</p>
<p>Williams performed surgery on the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. He did not invent open-heart surgery.</p>
<p>This is what Wiki reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on the 4th of September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo.  </p>
<p>The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a picture of Williams so you don&rsquo;t have to &#8216;wonder&rsquo; any longer:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yczrf4g" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yczrf4g</a></p>
<p>He seems to have a lot of White features, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Or that ingenious black man who invented the golf tee, to help those rather benighted Celtic types improve their scores!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah!! Oh Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know that! </p>
<p>Invented the golf tee?  WOW!  That certainly saved a lot of Celtic lives and set mankind forward  &mdash;  as much or more so than those pesky Whites who landed a man on the moon!</p>
<p>How could mankind survive without the invention of the golf tee?</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t come up with much else, could you?</p>
<p>How about a few WHITE inventions that have saved BILLIONS of lives world wide, increased life spans, eradicated scourges such as the plague, small pox and yellow fever and made life MUCH easier and more enjoyable for everyone:</p>
<p>Here are a few JUST FOR STARTERS:  Antibiotics and vaccinations and the heart-lunch machine:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The oxygenator was first conceptualised in the 17th century by Robert Hooke and developed into practical extracorporeal oxygenators by French and German experimental physiologists in the 19th century&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also these:  The internal combustion engine that powers the car you drive, the jet engine that allows you to travel across this country in a matter of hours instead of weeks or months, the computer which allows you to write snarky comments to the people whose race invented it, electricity and the electrical grid that powers your appliances (unless they are powered by gas which process was also invented by Whites), your television that broadcasts anti-White messages, and the beautiful images of the rings of Saturn, the &#8216;canals&rsquo; of Mars and the nebulae of deep space.</p>
<p>You do realize that the WHITE race invented and created these things or the technology that made them possible don&rsquo;t you?  According to Charles Murray:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rsquo;If we ignore national borders,&rsquo; he writes, &#8216;and instead create the most compact polygon that encloses 80 percent of the places where the significant figures grew up, [its] borders are defined by Naples, Marseilles, the western border of Dorset County in England, a point a few miles above Glasgow, the northern tip of Denmark, and a point a few miles east of the city that used to be Breslau in German Silesia (now Wroclaw in Poland)&hellip;This is the &#8216;European Core&rsquo;.. It is also more or less the core area of the Nordic subrace in Europe&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/y9v2x99" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/y9v2x99</a></p>
<p>You may refute this at will with your own facts and figures.</p>
<p>For black invention myths see here, spread the word and tell everyone you know  &mdash;  you do like the truth, don&rsquo;t you?:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/y8o75gw</p>
<p>Strange, isn&rsquo;t is, how non-Whites feel free to bash us, impugn us, mock us, wish us dead and gone  &mdash;  yet insist on having the the things we created and invented, the lifestyle we created for ourselves, our financial and economic systems that work (Adam Smith was a Scotsman, BTW), our sense of justice  &mdash;  hell, they want to take over from us this entire country, that we created  &mdash;  but believe it is a &#8216;cargo culture&rsquo;  &mdash;  it was just here all along, as is, that genocidal Whites stole it away and that the US will be a better place without those pesky Whites around. </p>
<p>Do you realize all peaceful, productive, creative White countries are a reflection of White DNA?  Look around if you don&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p>Yet those same non-Whites that wish to eradicate us will risk their lives to join the civilizations and cultures WE have created for OURSELVES, not for them.  Civilizations which they are wholly incapable of creating for themselves, civilizations that they are destroying, dragging us all back to the harsh conditions of the brutal stone age from whence we escaped.  Some say we deserve our fate and there is truth in that, but to fight back means risking one&rsquo;s job and reputation and being charged with Hate Crimes.</p>
<p>We should have kept our inventions, our creations, our way of life to ourselves.</p>

		<p>The techniques of argumentation of most leftists come from schoolyards: &#8220;Is so!  My Daddy said so.  You calling my Daddy a liar?  I&rsquo;ll beat you up&#8221;.  Rational statements are not contested with reason, but by evasion, or by appeals to questionable if not fraudulent authorities.  Or, as AmRen posters know, by threats of violence.  <br>
     44 Bon has laid the story and picture of the &#8220;Black&#8221; heart surgeon out, and has confirmed the statement that no one person invented open heart surgery, but no response is made to those points.  Instead, we get Afro-centric mythology.  This is why black discourse is conducted at such a high volume: they substitute passion for reason.  It&rsquo;s why leftists must suppress &#8220;hate&#8221; speech: they cannot refute it.  </p>
