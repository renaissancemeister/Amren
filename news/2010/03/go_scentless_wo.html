<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35871907/ns/business-us_business/">Go Scentless, Workers Warned After Lawsuit</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Change is in the air for Detroit city workers.</p>
<p>City employees will be urged not to wear perfume, cologne or aftershave as a result of a settlement in a federal lawsuit.</p>
<p>Officials plan to place warning placards in three city buildings. The signs will warn workers to avoid &#8220;wearing scented products, including &hellip; colognes, aftershave lotions, perfumes, deodorants, body/face lotions &hellip; (and) the use of scented candles, perfume samples from magazines, spray or solid air fresheners.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Detroit News reports the move stems from a $100,000 settlement in a federal lawsuit filed in 2008 by a city employee who said a colleague&rsquo;s perfume made it challenging for her to do her job.<br>

<p>Not surprising at all, quite typical in fact!</p>
<p>An sub-moronic claim is made by a black; it is taken seriously by the courts; and the result is that the smell of money is raised to a more pungently tangible reality, than Polo Sport or Old Spice could ever mask. It stinks and so too now will the Detroit municipal workplaces, when even deodorants are eventually outlawed, but Afro Sheen remains a &ldquo;culturally&rdquo; valid option.</p>
<p>Sort of like a bath in King Cobra and a hair drying with a hazy mist of exhaled Kools, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>

		<p>Black women DO love to bath in the most horrendous perfume.  They are worse than the 80 year old ladies you ride elevators with.  We have one (black woman) in our church that bathes in it, and I HATE when she sits anywhere near me.  Nice woman, but absolutely NO fashion consciousness nor clue about how much she STINKS when she thinks she is merely covering it up with perfume.  Several hispanic women are nearly as bad.</p>

		<p>On a few occasions, the actions of fellow employees have reduced my job effectiveness (or vica versa). In all cases, higher levels of management were advised of the problem and it was promptly resolved: either the offending party was order to stop offending or the complaining party was told to put up with it. That was in a more rational time and place.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is why was the woman entitled to damages. Was she fired or denied a promotion? If that was not the case, it seems the city of Detroit is the party suffering the loss occasioned by her reduced productivity. I am perplexed.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to disagree with those who say this is overkill. This is no more overkill than prohibiting someone in the next cubical from playing their boombox at max volume. I once shared an office with a woman who wore perfume so thick it would gag a maggot. If it wasn&rsquo;t for abuses like that then rules like this wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary.</p>

		<p>And after bulldozers have razed, indeed, half the city, will we not rise to sing, &#8220;Deeeee-troit, where the wind comes sweepin&rsquo; o&rsquo;er the plain, where the wavin&rsquo; wheat can sure smell sweet &hellip;&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I suppose people can go on wearing whatever they want because after the &#8220;plainfiff (probably a black woman) gets her money there is no way she will work again,,,,at least for a few weeks till the money runs out.</p>

		<p>I find that working around really stupid people makes it hard for me to do my job. Think there is any chance I could get that banned? I&rsquo;m not even sure that I like working with lazy people.</p>
<p>Every place that I have ever worked there were always some things that bothered me but I thought that was just part of the working world. I guess I should have taken them to court. Why work when you can sue? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one crazy world and not getting any better.</p>

		<p>Geez&hellip; considering the problems of Detroit in ruins, this sounds like a frivolous lawsuit? On the other hand, without Eurowhites around the city to blame for their problems it is funny to think of Blacks suing other Blacks over such a smelly situation. </p>

<p><br>
There are people who are  allergic or extremely sensitive to chemicals and odors to the extent that they become physically ill. This could have been the case, not merely a matter of a personal dislike for someone&rsquo;s perfume.<br>
