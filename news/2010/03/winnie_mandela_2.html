			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Fernandez, Daily Mail (London), March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nelson Mandela has been accused by his former wife of betraying South Africa&rsquo;s black population.</p>
<p>In a savage attack, Winnie Mandela said he had done nothing for the poor and should not have accepted the Nobel peace prize with the man who jailed him, FW de Klerk.</p>
<p>The 73-year-old said her ex-husband had become a &#8216;corporate foundation&rsquo; who was &#8216;wheeled out&rsquo; only to raise money for the ANC party he once led.</p>
<p>She said Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a cretin and claimed the sacrifices of Steve Biko and others in the fight against apartheid were being overlooked.</p>
<p>The comments were made in an interview yesterday with Nadira Naipaul, the wife of novelist V S Naipaul.</p>
<p>Mrs Mandela became notorious in 1991 when she was jailed for six years for the kidnap of Stompie Moeketsi  &mdash;  a sentence later cut to a fine.</p>
<p>Stompie, 14, had been murdered three years earlier by members of Mrs Mandela&rsquo;s bodyguard, the Mandela United Football Club.</p>
<p>She also caused outrage by endorsing the punishment of apartheid collaborators with &rsquo; necklacing&rsquo;  &mdash;  putting burning tyres around their necks.</p>
<p>Yesterday she said: &#8216;This name Mandela is an albatross around the necks of my family.</p>
<p>&#8216;You all must realise that Mandela was not the only man who suffered. There were many others, hundreds who languished in prison and died.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mandela did go to prison and he went in there as a young revolutionary but look what came out.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks. Economically we are still on the outside. The economy is very much &#8220;white&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;I cannot forgive him for going to receive the Nobel with his jailer de Klerk. Hand in hand they went. Do you think de Klerk released him from the goodness of his heart?</p>
<p>&#8216;He had to. The times dictated it, the world had changed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Mandelas, who divorced in 1996, were married for 38 years  &mdash;  although together for only five.</p>
<p>Mrs Mandela criticised her country&rsquo;s Truth and Reconciliation Committee  &mdash;  which she appeared before in 1997 and which implicated her in gross violations of human rights.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;What good does the truth do? How does it help to anyone to know where and how their loved ones are killed or buried?</p>
<p>&#8216;That Bishop Tutu who turned it all into a religious circus came here. He had a cheek to tell me to appear.</p>
<p>&#8216;I told him that he and his other like-minded cretins were only sitting there because of our struggle and me. Look what they make him do. The great Mandela. He has no control or say any more.</p>
<p>&#8216;They put that huge statue of him right in the middle of the most affluent white area of Johannesburg. Not here [in Soweto] where we spilled our blood.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mandela is now like a corporate foundation. He is wheeled out globally to collect the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said her daughters, Zenani, 51, and Zindzi, 50, had to struggle through red tape to speak to their 91-year-old father, who led South Africa from 1994 to 1999.<br>

		<p>Wow - &#8220;they&rsquo;ll do it every time!&#8221;  Doesn&rsquo;t matter if the black from the ghetto is American, South African, or from any other area.  They all put the blame for their own situation on somebody else, they never take responsibility for their own position, they all have their hands stuck out for free money, and they all excel at whining.  It&rsquo;s indigenous to the breed!  Why do people not &#8220;get&#8221; this???</p>

<p>&lsquo;That Bishop Tutu who turned it all into a religious circus came here. He had a cheek to tell me to appear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told him that he and his other like-minded cretins were only sitting there because of our struggle and me. Look what they make him do. The great Mandela. He has no control or say any more.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mandela is now like a corporate foundation. He is wheeled out globally to collect the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Winnie is 100% correct and might   &mdash;   might   &mdash;   make an ally for whites.</p>
<p>Sorry white South Africans, you simply don&rsquo;t belong there.</p>
<p>And Africans don&rsquo;t belong in white countries.</p>
<p>Fair is fair.</p>
<p>Of course their economy will collapse without whites, but there&rsquo;s really NO point in mentioning that.</p>
<p>First, she wouldn&rsquo;t believe us. </p>
<p>Second, money isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>

		<p>I agree with every word she utters.</p>
<p>However, it clearly shows what the blacks had in mind when they spoke of liberation and democracy - it was all about taking what the whites have built over 350 years. It is all about now. It is all about immediate gratification. This is also the reason why Zuma was elected as president : he sang &#8221; bring me my machine gun &#8221; and the masses read into that an attack on and the disposession of whites.</p>
<p>There is clearly no foresight nor any form of gratitude towards the white tax payers nor any respect for the &#8216;golden goose&rsquo;.</p>
<p>My personal prediction : somewhere between the Soccer World Cup ( a predicted damp squib with huge financial losses footed by the white tax payer ) and Christmas there will be huge black-on-black violence. The targets will be the foreign blacks and those in government.<br>

		<p>This is too rich. The great Goddess of anti-apartheid, Winnie Mandela, is savaging anti-apartheid&rsquo;s Great God, Nelson Mandela. Would we have believed it back in the 1980s when we were told by the MSM that the Mandelas were practically The First Family of Racial Progress?</p>
<p>This is like Michelle Obama viciously savaging Barack here in the US. Gone is the image of the faithful wife, adoringly standing at her husband&rsquo;s side. </p>
<p>Of course, I didn&rsquo;t generally hear any of these controversies from the MSM  &mdash;  it did what it always does when it encounters a racial story it doesn&rsquo;t like, or can&rsquo;t &#8220;spin&#8221; in a way it approves of  &mdash;  it buries it. </p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t hear anything negative about nelson. After all, without him, students would be relegated to celebrating RuPaul, Dennis Rodman and O.J. Simpson in black history parades in our public schools.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What good does the truth do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like a new slogan for black politicians.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela didn&rsquo;t divorce her because she advocated necklacing or because her goons killed a 14 year old year old- he had no objection to those things- but because she was doing the Bedspring Mambo with his young lawyer.</p>
