<h1>Student Senate Members to Target White Privilege Issues</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natalie Conrad, UWRFVoice (University of Wisconsin), February 25, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The UW-River Falls student senate will be sending up to five students to the 11th annual White Privilege Conference (WPC) from April 7-10 in La Crosse, Wis. The conference serves as a yearly opportunity to examine and explore difficult issues related to white privilege, white supremacy and oppression, according to the event&rsquo;s Web site.</p>
<p>There is expected to be approximately 1,500 people from 40 states who represent numerous sectors of our workforce, and include high school and college students, grass roots activists, educators, members of the spiritual community, musicians and artists, according to the Web site.</p>
<p>&#8220;White privilege is the concept that simply because one is Caucasian, there are inherent benefits within the framework of our society,&#8221; Student Senate Representative Lee Monson said. &#8220;The conference attempts to make its attendees aware of this privilege and attempts, through awareness, to heal this rift between peoples.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference&rsquo;s theme this year is &#8220;Health Inequities: Strategies. Action. Liberation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WPC&rsquo;s mission is to provide a forum for critical discussions about diversity, multicultural education and leadership, social justice, race/racism, sexual orientation, gender relations, religion and other systems of privilege/oppression, according to the Web site.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to send students to the White Privilege Conference because it is not well known and is a relatively new concept that the students at our university do not quite understand or even realize,&#8221; Student Senate Representative Brittany Williams said.</p>
<p>UWRF students are eligible to apply to attend the conference.</p>
<p>Students will be chosen based on the following criteria : campus involvement, leadership potential, diversity experience, enthusiasm/ambition, and individual character. The UWRF Student Senate will sponsor $250 per person, up to five people, to attend the conference. {snip}</p>
<p>They must also prepare a presentation to be given to the Student Senate in open forum, explaining the messages and valuable lessons from the trip within one month of returning, or pay for the Student Senate&rsquo;s contribution for the trip. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The five people that will be sent to this conference will be expected not only to further their own awareness, but to bring the knowledge they acquire from the conference back to campus,&#8221; Monson said.  {snip}</p>

		<p>I recently read &#8220;Unpacking the Invisible Backpack&#8221; by Peggy McIntosh, an essay often cited by so-called &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; (&#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is a misnomer - the term is actually a code word for &#8220;anti-white&#8221;).</p>
<p>McIntosh&rsquo;s essay is over 20 years old and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s holding up well. Conditions in Real America have changed significantly - especially in multicultural strongholds like Los Angeles, for example - and are changing rapidly. Whatever &#8220;privilege&#8221; still exists ain&rsquo;t long for this world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a group of white advocates take a swipe at some of these central tenets of &#8220;anti-racism,&#8221; multiculturalism, etc. There needs to be a dissenting voice telling these kids that there&rsquo;s another perspective out there than the dominant view which is telling them to commit cultural and racial suicide.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the gooney birds at REAL, Antifa, and Jeffrey Imm, will call every hotel in LaCrosse, Wisconsin to find the hotel that will be hosting this event, and threaten its staff with death threats.  After all, it&rsquo;s a race conference that many people think spreads hate and vitriol towards those of certain racial groups.</p>
<p>Then again, the rat-infested no-tell dump that will host the White Privilegeapalooza needs the money.  To threaten some of its employees with death would probably be sadly redundant.</p>

		<p>I saw some fool at IKEA a couple years ago with a WPC t-shirt. She looked exactly like you would expect somebody who attended this conference to look. Somebody who&rsquo;s major is Women&rsquo;s Studies and whose senior thesis probably has a title like &#8216;Suppressed Queer Sexualities and Intertextualities in Heteronormative 19th Century Poetry in the Context of Contemporary Neo-Marxist Critical Theory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Students will be chosen based on the following criteria:&#8221;<br/>
- campus involvement [anti-white activism]<br/>
- leadership potential [drama queen]<br/>
- diversity experience [hate crime hoax experience preferred]<br/>
- enthusiasm/ambition [extreme gullibility]<br/>
- individual character [toe the party line]</p>
<p>&#8220;The UWRF Student Senate will sponsor $250 per person, up to five people, to attend the conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where your money is going alumni.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must also prepare a presentation to be given to the Student Senate in open forum, explaining the messages and valuable lessons from the trip within one month of returning, or pay for the Student Senate&rsquo;s contribution for the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have no choice. You will find the lessons &#8216;valuable&rsquo; no matter how idiotic the drivel may be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five people that will be sent to this conference will be expected not only to further their own awareness, but to bring the knowledge they acquire from the conference back to campus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come back and propagandize wiser students who know better than to waste their time at neo-Marxist conferences.</p>

		<p>I really wish someone had explained white privilege to me decades ago. Had some kind soul done so, I would not have:<br/>
     studied hard in high school to get into a good college;<br/>
     studied hard in that good college; <br/>
     worked back-breaking summer jobs to help pay the tuition;<br/>
     imposed on my parents the burden of contributing to that tuition;<br/>
     obtained, after graduation, a commission in the Navy to do my little part in defeating the USSR in the Cold War;<br/>
     worked hard over the last couple of decades in my chosen field to establish in the eyes of others my competence; <br/>
     contributed time, effort, and money to support religious and cultural efforts that I hold dear; and<br/>
     been as good a son, brother, nephew, cousin, and friend as I knew how.<br/>
How I now wish that I had learned long ago that I needn&rsquo;t have done anything, because I was guaranteed a privileged position,<br/>
simply because I am white.<br/>
What a complete fool I have been. Yet&hellip;<br/>
Where would our country be today without fools like me?<br/>

		<p>Discussions of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; should be treated by law enforcement with the same attention as anything that incites racial hatred and violence.</p>
<p>Teaching blacks to resent whites for &#8220;privilege&#8221; is dangerous to other whites. Blacks have very little control over their emotions and anger. The can strike out violently with very little provocation. If they are seeing all white people as having &#8220;privilege&#8221; based upon a systemic racism that institutionalizes white power, then blacks are walking time bombs and could explode in your face at any moment with robbery, rape, and murder. They call it &#8220;we be kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whites who teach blacks about white privilege are race traitors and should be treated as enemies of the state.  Blacks who mention white privilege should be arrested for inciting violence.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m seriously tempted to register just so that I can attend and secretly capture the entire event on audio and video.  Problem is that I&rsquo;d probably end up sitting in the back row trying not to break out in laughter.  </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re basically saying an inner city white kid who&rsquo;s dad is in jail and who gets harassed every day or even beat up by African American kids in school, he&rsquo;s the privileged embodiment of white supremacy and a spoke in the wheel of global oppression, while a black kid, of questionable parentage, living in the suburbs, using a minority scholarship, proudly and loudly black, sent to a white-privilege symposium, and desperately recruited by top schools and businesses across the country, this guy living under the cold shadow of white privilege. Blacks all agree with that. And it&rsquo;s virtually a crime to say anything else. Hate crime I believe it&rsquo;s called. </p>

		<p>Diversity = Unearned Minority Race Privilege</p>
<p>All white children need to learn that formula before they learn anything else, except maybe White + Black = Black.</p>
<p>Amren readers need to devote less time to commenting on black lack of intelligence and black propensity for violence and corruption. We need to focus on unearned minority race privilege and finding ways to hold blacks accountable to whites for all that we have done for them to our detriment.  They owe us an unpayable debt. We need to teach our people how to demand that blacks admit to us that all their privileges derive from our charity. Blacks owe us an unpayable debt for our not sending them all back home to Africa, the land of their voodoo souls.</p>
<p>We need to hold accountable liberal white elites who worship the Multicult and who demand that &#8220;We need to do more to foster diversity and help minorities&#8221;.  They must not be allowed to marry white women, not live in white neighborhoods, not go to white Jewish synagogues and Christian churches, not join white private clubs, not work for white bosses, not have white customers, not allow their white daughters to make white grandbabies.</p>
<p>WE MUST LEARN HOW TO MAKE AFROVOODOO WORSHIPING WHITES LIVE INTO THE REALITIES OF AFROVOODOOISM. </p>
<p>Justice for most of us requires misery for some of us.</p>

<p>For example, Atlanta&rsquo;s Standard Club is recognized as the premiere Jewish private club in Georgia. Are they &#8220;passionately embracing Diversity&#8221;; do they demonstrate &#8220;inclusive tolerance&#8221;; do they &#8220;welcome members from all of Atlanta&rsquo;s vibrant communities&#8221;? </p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the War Between the States, the Jewish population of Atlanta was primarily of German and Hungarian descent. While they were devout and observant Jews, they were equally proud and devoted to their German heritage and their valued German culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>These Jews were &#8220;devoted&#8221; to their heritage and &#8220;valued&#8221; their culture? That seems a bit ethnocentric and self selecting. Will they hold themselves accountable to all those &#8220;others&#8221; whom they excluded from the benefits heritage and culture?  Will the applaud the Son and Daughters of the Confederacy for their devotion of heritage and value of culture?</p>
<p> &#8220;A group of members of the Association, the organizers of the Club, were the wealthiest and most prominent members of the German Jewish community.&#8221; </p>
<p>German Jew means Ashkenazi, not Aryan Nordic.  Doesn&rsquo;t becoming wealthy mean you oppressed poor people? According to Jewish college professors, you can&rsquo;t get rich unless you steal from poor people. When will the Standard Club atone for the sin of getting rich? When will they open their doors to all, both rich and poor alike?</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;The modern Standard Club has gone back to the policy of the Concordia Association in accepting members of other faiths and the club today has non-Jewish members.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many of those non Jew members are African American?  Do the white Jewish members allow their fully developed late teen bikini clad daughters and wives to swim in the pool when the African American teen boys are swimming and frolicking and we jess be kepp&rsquo;n it real?</p>
<p>See too many white people at the Standard Club; see 100% whites at the Standard Club. Are they holding all white Tea Parties? Shouldn&rsquo;t Chris Matthews and Keith Olberman investigate the Standard Club for being &#8220;too white&#8221;?</p>

<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the Atlanta Human Rights Commission investigate the Standard Club for racisss tendencies? When will the naacp hold protests? Can Jesse and Al start the prayer vigils and marches?<br/>
What would MLK do? Doesn&rsquo;t the Standard Club insult the memory of Lincoln and all the &#8220;esteemed renowned civil rights icons and martyrs&#8221; by not advertising how many historic first African American members they have?  Why no afro pictures on their web site? Are they afraid of black people?<br/>

<p>The pressing questions for  whites today are:</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
Do white people have a right to existence?</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t, then who will end their existence, and how?</p>
<p>If they do, then under what conditions will their existence be allowed?</p>
<p>Who will set those conditions?</p>
<p>Will those conditions be applied to non whites?</p>
<p>(If not, then &#8220;equal protection under the law&#8221; does not exist in fact.)</p>
<p>If conditions of white existence will be set, how will they be enforced? What will be done to dissenters? Who will do it to them?</p>
<p>What role will whites themselves play in the discussions about their right to exist, the conditions of that existence, the administering of their adherence to those conditions, and their punishment for violating those conditions?</p>
<p>What concessions are demanded of whites for the allowance of continuing  their existence?</p>
<p>If they are more restricted in exercising their rights of existence than are non whites, will non whites show them compassion for their oppressed and marginalized status?</p>
<p>Will non whites make any sacrifices to alleviate the suffering of restricted whites?</p>
<p>If not, what conclusions can be drawn about the differences between whites and non whites?</p>
<p>Do white high school and college students who are drowning in Diversity know how to ask these questions?</p>
<p>Are they willing to suffer the consequences of asking these questions?</p>
<p>Can they find new tactics that reverse the consequences of Questioning Diversity and place the discomfort and cost upon their accusers?</p>
<p>Who can help them?</p>
<p>How long can open access to the Internet exist when such questions as these can be posted for anyone to read?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t the SPLC, ADL, and the NAACP petition their best friend Eric Holder to shut down Amren?</p>

		<p>The following sponsors of this nonsense MUST be boycotted. They have supported this cause against White people for several years:</p>
<p>Continental Airines<br/>
LaQuinta Inns and Suites<br/>
The Sheraton Hotels<br/>
Double Tree Hotels<br/>
The Hartford Insurance</p>
<p>Several major Christian churches have also been sponsors. See for yourself: http://www.uccs.edu/~wpc/sponsors-archiveone.html</p>

		<p>Over a decade ago my essay, &#8220;White Male Privilege: A Social Construct for Political Oppression,&#8221; was published in the Journal of Libertarian Studies, and can be read on line by googling &#8220;white male privilege.&#8221;  I can assure you, I have not been invited to the Wisconsin hate-whitey conference.  I urge all to glance at my article, for this concept- declaring whites as privileged- is used to demand ever more more restrictions on whites.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>There are no possible criticisms of white privilege by blacks that are not  racially motivated hate crimes.</p>
<p>A race advances for centuries and generations in order to pass on advantages of blood. To criticize the benefits of upward striving and familial love of a race and its betterment of its children is pure race hatred.</p>
<p>Diversity = Anti White Privilege = Privilege of the Anti Whites =<br/>
Racially Motivated Hate Crime </p>
<p>All black on white crime is racially motivated. All black criminals knew their white victims were white. All black criminals knew that whites enjoy raciss unearned white privilege that makes them a legitimate target for robbery, rape, and murder.</p>
<p>We are in a race war, and only the blacks know it.</p>
<p>We owe them nothing.</p>

		<p>White privilege is what created the universities that these fools have to protest in today.  White privilege created this society, which is Heaven to Haitians and other people who live in truly poverty-stricken countries.  White privilege is the brains that created the technology that allow us to have a higher standard of living than anything you&rsquo;ll find in Africa, Central America, South America, or Mexico.  So these ignorant students, who have no idea what REAL discrimination is, are actually attempting to destroy the very civilization that allows them to go to college in relative comfort.  Thanks a lot, kiddies!</p>

		<p>The story below reminds me of one I heard about the University of Virginia. A black fraternity had adopted a highway for regular trash pickup. A white fraternity drove down  the  stretch of black adopted  highway one night and dumped several bags of white cotton balls all over the road. When the blacks went out to clean up the mess, some whites &#8220;just happened&#8221; to come by with a camera and took photos of the blacks bending down and picking up white cotton off the sides of their highway.</p>
<p>Given my age and having lived in the Deep South my entire life, why have I encountered only two stories of cotton balls and blacks?</p>
<p>Blacks must be truly privileged to live down here and not constantly encounter raciss cotton balls thrown in the yards of their neighborhoods, schools, and &#8220;Gospel Holiness&#8221; tabernacle churches. Whites are much nicer than we&rsquo;re supposed to be. Or maybe we&rsquo;ve just lost our creative genius.</p>
<p><br/>
Missouri has no hate crime laws? Isn&rsquo;t there an ADL chapter there? Somebody&rsquo;s not doing their job!</p>

<p><br/>
University of Missouri police are investigating what appears to have been a racially motivated incident Friday morning at the campus&rsquo; Gaines/Oldham Black Cultural Center.</p>
<p>Cotton balls were strewn across the center&rsquo;s lawn, walkway and bushes between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m. Police said two people were seen running from the center grounds.</p>
<p>Whoever is responsible could be charged with littering or tampering, said MU Police Capt. Brian Weimer. State statutes contain no hate crime law, but if racial motivation were found, &ldquo;it would enhance the punishment for the crime,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<p>When did this ridiculous term &#8216;white privelige&rsquo;come about? Must be the &rsquo;60s? Does anyone know who invented the term?</p>
<p>How do these fools reconcile such a term with the &#8216;rednecks&rsquo; that they despise - or do they seriously think they are losers that had the potential to be doctors and politicians and failed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to be a fly on the wall at the above conference; it could be the best live comedy show in history. A pity that it&rsquo;s costing the HARDWORKING American taxpayer though. No white privelege there&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well said Tom.S.</p>
<p>Here in Australia just like the States minorities and so called special interest groups get more than white Australians, so who is the priveleged?</p>
<p>It is just another boring Fabian attempt at undermining civilisation.</p>
<p>When will those dumb pasty urban whites wake and smell reality?</p>

		<p>Whites ONCE had priveleges that other groups did not, but white people had absolutely rational reasons for establishing boundaries.  They didn&rsquo;t create such rules just to be hateful.  In the 1960&rsquo;s, the U.S. tried to establish equal opportunity, but it became privelege for non-whites.  Though most people now realize (if they didn&rsquo;t before) that no amount of coddling can equalize whites, blacks, and Hispanics, too many are afraid to say so, and so the nation just keeps throwing good money after bad.  If students don&rsquo;t graduate, then fire the teachers.  And when they still don&rsquo;t graduate, fire some more teachers.  After a while, the ghettos and barrios will have no teachers, and then we can blame THAT, can&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>Yes, these are really examples of white privilege:</p>
<p>1. Being told I&rsquo;m a racist and the fault of the world&rsquo;s problems.<br/>
2. Being told it&rsquo;s racist if I want to be with other whites, yet okay for blacks to do the same.<br/>
3. Being told it&rsquo;s racist to defend myself from blacks and hispanics, yet it&rsquo;s open season for them to harm me.<br/>
4. Being told I, as a white employer, have to be told who I have to hire and promote unless I want to get sued royally.<br/>
5. Having my hard earned money being funneled into anti-white and and anti-Western agendas without any say so on my part.<br/>
6. Being told it&rsquo;s racist for me to stereotype all blacks, yet it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to say &#8216;white people&rsquo; or &#8216;the White Man&rsquo; and blame ALL whites for slavery and for the displacement of Native Americans by the same lazy black and liberal thugs that then want me to support them.</p>
<p>Are these the shining examples of white privilege that I and other whites have had the pleasure of experiencing?  Just wondering.</p>

		<p>To poster #4, I am also of the same mind.  I first heard about this white priviledge thing two years ago from a liberal white twenty-something male in a public school which is 100% non-white, the staff was about 60% white.  I was in disbelief about what he was telling me - that our being white made us unjust oppressors with unearned priviledges.</p>
<p>I protested, pointing out my own story of a life of back breaking work to get ahead, and I am from humble beginnings to boot.  No one gave me anything, I paid for my own college by working 2-3 jobs.  My parents are high school dropouts, factory workers, etc&hellip;  He was unmoved and would not budge, claiming that because I was white I could go to college.  </p>
<p>I protested that where I was from, almost everyone was white so being white conferred no special advantages.  Again, deaf ears.</p>
<p>This stuff is really, really dangerous folks.  It teaches a version of history where whites do nothing but oppress and everyone else is just held back and only need a chance to shine.</p>
<p>We need to root out this philosophy by cutting off its funding.  Don&rsquo;t those white liberals who lead these movements realize that they, if they followed their own beliefs, should step aside for deserving minorities to take charge?</p>

		<p>To get a WI teaching liscence in the UW system you must pass Multiculturalism.  I suspect its the same all over the country.  For me it was a real eye-opener.  I was told my white privilage ensured me a life on easy street, I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and I would never face any struggles the rest of my life.  The rest of the classwork focused on how my white skin was responsible for all the racism and hatred the world ever faced.  &#8220;You have just been found guilty, now repent!&#8221;  I can still see the young feminists in training sitting in the front row soaking up all the indoctrination nodding their heads.  </p>
<p>The males in class consisted of &#8220;country kids&#8221; who may have been a touch nieve but had all kinds of pride in who they were and didn&rsquo;t like to be told they were guilty for crimes they didn&rsquo;t commit.  We were all lower-middle class, sons of farmers and loggers.  Mom and Pop didn&rsquo;t go to college, Dad probably was in the service during Viet-Nam.  I was first generation to have indoor plumbing my entire life, let alone a chance at advanced education.  We were all raised with morals and values and work ethic.  We were most likely all Christian (whoops, suppose thats evil too.) In this &#8220;class&#8221; we were told DAILY how being born white made us PRIVILAGED and GUILTY.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to say that not one male in my class was indoctrinated.  We made sure of it.  If anything we were made aware of an evil agenda.  As vile as these classes and conferences seem, maybe some good does come out of them.</p>
<p>P.S. When I hear &#8220;white privilage&#8221; I hear &#8220;never had to work for anything.&#8221;  NEVER tell a northern WI boy he&rsquo;s never worked hard or earned anything!!  My blood boils!</p>

		<p>&#8220;white fraternity drove down the stretch of black adopted highway one night and dumped several bags of white cotton balls all over the road. When the blacks went out to clean up the mess, some whites &ldquo;just happened&rdquo; to come by with a camera and took photos of the blacks bending down and picking up white cotton off the sides of their highway&#8221;.</p>
<p>What is not rare at all, and perhaps bordered on common occurrence in black neighborhoods, or recently claimed black neighborhoods, for black neighbors to use the white neighbors yard as place to unload the dumpster if there is even the slightest imagined grievance. </p>

		<p>There are no privileges reserved for Whites. However, I believe that being White is a privilege.  I thank God that I was born into a race whose accomplishments are without equal.  One can hardly blame the other races for their jealousy and false belief that we somehow cheated our way to the top of the racial hierarchy.  What we have done is astonishing.    </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve observed &#8220;white privilege&#8221; as having the same rhetoric as &#8220;male privilege&#8221;. The paradigm was invented by the feminists to attack males, and then was extended to whites in general once the feminists got a taste of victory but still hated themselves for being such horrid failures as women, so they applied privilege studies to whites in general as a salve to their own pains.  Peggy McIntosh may have been the leader. If seen her on a video, and probably no man has ever shown any interest in touching her, so she&rsquo;s an angry and taking it out on us decent people. Even ugly women still have wombs that release hormones and make them want babies. If men don&rsquo;t show interest, women go nuts.  It&rsquo;s like forcing an alcoholic to take one drink a day for breakfast and then nothing else till the next morning. The fact that her ideas are picked up by institutions shows us what kind of people have control of the institutions.</p>

		<p>Are white men privileged?  Of course they are.  Are intelligent people privileged?  Yes.  So too are attractive people, healthy people, and hard working people.</p>
<p>These are all gifts.  Whiteness is a gift.  To be a white male is a gift.  To be intelligent and good looking is a gift.  Should a person with these gifts not use them?  That would be the ultimate crime and evil.  </p>
<p>We can no more make a just and peaceful society where the gift of whiteness is render null and void than we can make a just and peaceful society where intelligence is debased and stupidity advanced by affirmative action.</p>
<p>White privilege is the benefit that comes from being white.  Parents passed on to their sons and daughters the genes that made them intelligent, good looking, and white.  They in turn received these wonderful genetic gifts from their parents and ancestors.  White people also received from the same ancestors a gift of a wonderful society and culture.  The gift of whiteness with its accompanying attributes fits perfectly with the other gift from our white ancestors, the gift of the American culture and society.  </p>
<p>Stop and think for a moment, American society is like the environment.  You should no more destroy the white privilege society of America than you should destroy the Redwood Forest or the Grand Canyon.  </p>
<p>Not all lands have white privilege.  But all lands do have a privilege.  China has Chinese privilege, Japan, Japanese privilege, Africa, African privilege, the Middle East, Semitic privilege.</p>
<p>If people do not like the white privilege land from California to the New York Island, from the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters they can go elsewhere.  America was made for white privilege.  </p>
<p>So what should be the natural reaction when some one tells you that you have white privilege?  Tell him yes I do have white privilege and stop trying to steal it from me.  Go steal a Chinaman&rsquo;s privilege or an African man&rsquo;s privilege, but leave me alone you are a thief.</p>

		<p>My white privilege allowed me not to go to college on anyone else&rsquo;s dollar, as even my parents were of the mindset that they owed me my upbringing to age 18 and to finish public school. If I went to college, I would work my own way through. I was refused several county and state jobs because the position had to go to a minority, though they were less qualified. I own my own business, which, my white privilege doesn&rsquo;t allow me to qualify for tax deferrments and interest-free loans that an immigrant qualifies for in starting up a business on American soil.</p>
<p>My white privilege prohibits me from making any comment whatsoever outloud about the clear fact that someone I&rsquo;m speaking of is not white, even though it is visibly obvious. My white privilege allows me the gift of paying for minorities&rsquo; welfare, food stamps and housing with my tax dollars.</p>
<p>Even so, I adamantly refused to be ashamed, embarrassed or guility that I was born white.</p>

		<p>With all these evil white qualities.. I just can&rsquo;t figure the rationality.. why there were such few black takers back to Africa, expenses paid.. when Lincoln offered&hellip;???  As well if the shoe was on the other foot and it had been white slavers that captured fellow whites and sold them to the black world as human cargo&hellip;And then in time if this eventually caused social conflict and war in Africa between blacks over the morality of slavery&hellip;etc. I can&rsquo;t help but believe whites would have been grateful and more dissapointed with their own race selling them than others buying. As well I&rsquo;m reasonably certain they would have high tailed it back to Europe when offered the chance. I think there is more going on here than the pursuit of justice&hellip;I can&rsquo;t help but think the blacks are trying to insinuate themselves into the white genenome. Whites are satisfied with their own kind, blacks appear not to be.</p>

		<p>I was confused the first time a lefty used the phrase &#8220;White privilege&#8221; on me. But I quickly realized that &#8220;White privilege&#8221; actually refers to the inherent qualities of high IQ, kindness, willingness and tendency to work and create, common sense, and possession of a soul.</p>
