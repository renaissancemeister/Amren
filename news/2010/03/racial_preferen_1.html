<h1><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2010/03/23/racial-preferences-in-obamacare/">Racial Preferences in Obamacare</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>La Shawn Barber, Michelle Malkin, March 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Transfer of wealth and &#8220;crucial decisions&#8221; aside, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains provisions that provide incentives for racial discrimination. {snip}</p>
<p>One provision states that programs with &#8220;a record of training individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups or from a rural or disadvantaged background&#8221; will be given priority for government money. This is only one of several such provisions. Programs and medical institutions that practice racial preferences will be moved further up the money queue than programs and medical institutions that disregard race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights called the provisions racially discriminatory and sent President Barack Obama and Congress letters warning them about the provisions. The politicians ignored the warning, naturally.</p>
<p>The Commission said the inclusion of the discriminatory provisions appeared to motivated by a crusade to narrow racial health care disparities and the belief that the disparities are caused by a shortage of medical professionals who are members of preferred minority groups. {snip}</p>
<p>The Commission rightly concluded that medical institutions competing for federal dollars may end up lowering academic standards for minority applicants, and added that &#8220;race-based attempts to achieve some ill-defined &#8216;critical mass&rsquo; of minority students or to demonstrate a &#8216;sufficient&rsquo; record of training such students are constitutionally suspect.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p>
<p>If the Obama administration&rsquo;s going to violate the Civil Rights Act, one would think the discriminatory provisions actually would solve the racial health care disparity problem. The Commission cited research that showed raising the quality of care at hospitals in the 500 largest minority serving areas would improve minority health care more than eliminating racial disparities within every provider in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Oh let&rsquo;s face it - this whole scheme is, on so many levels, one big transfer of wealth from whites to non-whites. That there are specific acts of discrimination in the &#8220;fine print&#8221; is only to be expected. </p>

		<p>The FACT is, it probably won&rsquo;t matter, since 43% of the medical doctors surveyed said they plan to leave the medical profession if the Obamacare bill passed.  So we&rsquo;re going to have half the docs we had before with at least a third MORE patients.  What this means is, people had better get real familiar with alternative treatments for their diseases, because the medical profession will probably be way too full of patients to help new patients in time.  </p>

The black congressional caucus and their supporters have been stealthily pushing for this &#8216;reform&rsquo; and have largely been tight lipped.</p>
<p>I suspect something big is coming and we don&rsquo;t know what the full extent or impact is going to be until it&rsquo;s implemented.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;One provision states that programs with &ldquo;a record of training individuals who are from underrepresented minority groups or from a rural or disadvantaged background&rdquo; will be given priority for government money.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The provision for &#8216;rural&rsquo; training was thrown in to make it look like this is going to be spread out fairly and equally but we all know who they&rsquo;re talking about when they say &#8216;disadvantaged background&rsquo; (what background? Descendants of slaves perhaps?).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it from the beginning. Blacks and other minorities are going to move to the head of the line because they&rsquo;re going to be declared &#8216;at risk and undeserved&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If white supporters of health care reform thought they were being denied health care before, they&rsquo;re about to see what blatant denial of care based on race is all about.</p>
<p>Watch for an underground network of expensive health care for whites to spring up; that is, those who can afford double the cost; paying into the system and paying to stay out.</p>

<p>Always seeming to be pushed back to when there are no whites left at all, and the calls for ending &#8216;systemic racism&rsquo; and &#8216;oppression&rsquo; - aimed at whites in some other town, city, or, eventually, at whites in the past or over in Europe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This finding seems intuitive, but the racism-under-every-rock civil rights industry prefers to deal in quantity over quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that blacks in general, the black leadership, and Obama, don&rsquo;t care whether non-whites are qualified or not.  Being black, they&rsquo;re embarassed by the scant few black professionals in the country and will support any policy or program that will put up a black carboard figure so that they have a facade to hold up to the world, in place of competence, which sends the message that blacks can compete just like everybody else.</p>
<p>Oh, how it would soothe their damaged egos to have the necessary black shills in place in order to fool everybody into thinking they&rsquo;re not really an incompetent race after all.</p>
<p>As this policy affects the field of medicine, I mean, who cares if a few thousand people are killed every year from malpractice?  It&rsquo;s a small price to pay to help heal their damaged egos.</p>
<p>And, are they concerned about living a lie?  Of course not.  Right now they&rsquo;re engaged in so much deception concerning accomplishments and inventions they compensate for the lack of evidence by lying about it.  How many false black myths are there about inventions?  And, all that is necessary for them to claim that blacks ruled Egypt and built the pyramids is to lie about it and show a few statuettes of black slaves taken from a pharoah&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>That DNA reveals the pharoahs to be non-blacks is of little consequence since the facts are always ignored and the lies harped upon constantly by the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>These healthcare mandates are just more of the same.</p>
<p>Those countries that have blacks have been cursed unmercifully.  Their black problem will never end so long as blacks are present.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Transfer of wealth and &lsquo;crucial decisions&rsquo; aside, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains provisions that provide incentives for racial discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am utterly disgusted with Neo-Comrade Malkin&rsquo;s take here!</p>
<p>This entire &ldquo;health care&rdquo; charade, is simply an excuse to:</p>
<p>1.) Steal as much of &ldquo;whitey&rsquo;s&rdquo; resources as possible, via a &ldquo;transfer of wealth;&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.) And, to commit as many acts of &ldquo;legalized&rdquo; genocide against our people, via &ldquo;crucial decisions,&rdquo; as we are stupid enough to allow.</p>
<p>This debased bunk about discrimination in medical recruiting for schools, is simply a dysfunctional symptom of the problem, not the cause. It is only about training the nonwhite butchers and terrorists in other words, who will carry out the &ldquo;transfer of wealth and crucial decisions,&rdquo; in future. Any grudging respect for this alien interloper, Neo-Comrade Malkin, I may have once had, is now unreservedly obliterated for me.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re right, but I think the &#8220;opposition to racism&#8221; tone in this article isn&rsquo;t from the left, but from the standpoint of opposing affirmative action.

		<p>Late last year my mom thought she was having a heart attack.  She drove herself to the local hospital and entered the emergency room and told the Hispanic woman in admitting that she thought she was dying and needed to see a doctor right away.  The woman waved her arm across the waiting room, pointing out all the Hispanics already in-queue and said &#8220;b*tch, everyone in here thinks they&rsquo;re dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mom wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that and marched around the woman and starting banging on doors until someone came out and took care of her.</p>
<p>But welcome to the future of health care in America.  Most contact with patients will be provided by minorities, just like any other government service, and white folks will be perpetually at the back of the line (except when it comes for paying for it).</p>

		<p>NAMs (non Asian minorities) are already floated through post-grad, law and med schools to garner funding favors from the feds. More discriminatory provisions will ratchet medical malpractice, misfeasance and fraud into overdrive down the dystopian road. </p>
<p>The upside will be that many will no longer have to opt for a minimum wage position building your Whopper or Big Mac. What&rsquo;s the downside? Dropping your lettuce on the floor always beats dropping your liver.</p>

<p>  #2 They will import large numbers of doctors from the 3rd world.</p>

<p>Point taken; however, with this qualifier: affirmative action has basically become a bogeyman (or symptom) of a greater problem. You cannot separate the Marxist &ldquo;grand goals&rdquo; here, simply to reject one of the tools being used to achieve them.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve known Michelle since she was a student in the High School where I taught. She is DEFINITELY not a leftist. Her parents where immigrants who jumped through all the hoops in order to earn their citizenship. She and her family are fine people. There should be more like her. She&rsquo;s an exemplary American.</p>

A lot of doctors saw it coming in the last few years and quit the medical profession already; not only those close to retirement, but many in the prime of their careers.<br>
For perspective, an alternative practice D.O. told me (in 1990!) that it was like &#8220;working for the government.<br>
Fast forward to 2007: my family doc, a D.O., left the business to open a non-medical practice.<br>
My hand surgeon is about to have a fit because he&rsquo;s so tired of government strangulation.<br>
I asked a provider today what he thought. Long pause&hellip;said he was not entirely happy with what happened, and winked.<br>
The industry is going to empty out entirely, leaving the lousy AA hires and Obamashamalamadingdong will import philipino sawbones quacks and butchers.<br>
American healthcare, RIP. It will take all of five years, and we will be at third world standards. <br>
Good job, Herr Kommisar!</p>

		<p>RE: 43% of Doctors planning to leave the profession:</p>
<p> What will happen is that we will import foreign-born doctors. This is exactly what happened in the UK, and it will happen here. Since they&rsquo;ll be, by definition, highly educated elite immigrants, there&rsquo;ll be very little opposition. Then they will use chain migration to flood us with a few million more- probably Indians.</p>
<p>Remember what happened to the Motel industry? A few below market loans, chain migration, and now 50% of motels in this country are owned by people named Patel- an Indian ethnic subgroup.</p>
<p>I would weep for my country, except it isn&rsquo;t my country anymore.</p>

		<p>Just don&rsquo;t go to non-white doctors.</p>
<p>If anyone accuses you of being racist, simply tell them that if they want to go to an affirmative-action doctor, it&rsquo;s their choice - but not to come crying to you once they&rsquo;re further injured (or dead) because of incompetence.</p>
