			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Epstein, USA Today, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Keivan Stassun arrived at Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s department of physics and astronomy in 2003 as an assistant professor, he saw neighboring, historically black Fisk University as an obvious collaborator. The two institutions are two miles apart in Nashville. {snip}</p>
<p>Fisk had a successful physics program that produced more terminal master&rsquo;s degrees for black students than any other U.S. institution, and Vanderbilt had good Ph.D. programs in physics, astronomy and materials science that produced very few minority graduates. Stassun&rsquo;s idea &#8220;was very granular and very proximal,&#8221; he recalls: &#8220;Let&rsquo;s help those students get from the master&rsquo;s to the Ph.D.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the fall of 2004, the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master&rsquo;s-to-Ph.D. Bridge Program took in its first five students. Since then, another 30 have enrolled, all from groups that are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. (Just three of the students are white, and all are women.) {snip}</p>
<p>But when the program started, the whole thing seemed like a big risk to many. {snip}</p>
<p>Not to mention that the students were far from certain to succeed. &#8220;These are not students that we poached from some other program,&#8221; says Stassun, who co-directs the program with Arnold Burger, vice provost for academic initiatives at Fisk. &#8220;They represent a real value added to the national production of Ph.D.s in science. Without this option, they would have pursued another option entirely&#8221; and not earned doctorates.</p>
<p>Thus far, however, just three students have dropped out of the program.</p>
<p>{snip} It was only after winning a $1 million National Science Foundation grant in 2004 that he was able to launch the bridge program, he says. &#8220;Scientists are entrepreneurial and will go where the money is.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Giving Students a Chance</b></p>
<p>The bridge program puts more students in the pipeline and supports them through it. Burger describes it as &#8220;a mentoring program for those who need extra preparation, extra mentoring&#8221; between college and a Ph.D. program. Without the program, many likely would have chosen to enter the workforce after earning bachelor&rsquo;s or terminal master&rsquo;s degrees. Students in the bridge program typically spend two years working toward a master&rsquo;s at Fisk before moving onto a doctoral program at Vanderbilt or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Underrepresented minorities are 50% more likely than their peers to earn terminal master&rsquo;s degrees before getting Ph.D.&rsquo;s in STEM fields, and Stassun says the reasons have to do with confidence and availability. The leading producers of black and Latino bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in STEM fields are minority-serving institutions that, Stassun says, &#8220;perhaps do not have the full breadth of undergraduate curricular offerings&#8221; to prepare students for doctoral programs, so students turn to terminal master&rsquo;s programs as a way to make themselves more competitive before applying for Ph.D.s. Others see it as &#8220;kind of a hedging of your bets,&#8221; he says, in case they&rsquo;re never able to make it to a Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terminal master&rsquo;s degrees have also &#8220;been a major growth industry&#8221; at many minority-serving institutions, Stassun says, noting that many such programs have nearly doubled in the last decade or so. The number of minority students earning master&rsquo;s degrees in the physical sciences and engineering from minority-serving institutions rose from 119 in 1987 to 753 in 2006, according to NSF data. But the numbers who go further than the terminal master&rsquo;s are small. In 2008, American universities awarded Ph.D.s in physics to just 12 black U.S. citizens, out of 905 awarded to U.S. citizens of any race that year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The promise of new minority faculty members in STEM fields excites McCarty, Vanderbilt&rsquo;s provost, who thinks the program&rsquo;s graduates will be role models for future generations of minority students. &#8220;These are disciplines where it&rsquo;s been very difficult to affect the diversity of students, but when you have a professor who knows the challenges you face, it can help.&#8221; A study released earlier this month by Cornell University&rsquo;s Higher Education Research Institute suggests that black college students are more likely to persist in science majors if they have at least one black science instructor.</p>
<p>Stassun  &mdash;  whose mother emigrated from Mexico  &mdash;  and many of the Fisk faculty involved in the program are themselves underrepresented minorities, and empathetic to the issues such students face in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bridge program, Stassun insists, isn&rsquo;t a way for underqualified students to get into STEM Ph.D. programs at Vanderbilt. &#8220;We deliberately decided that we did not want the bridge to be a back door into Vanderbilt. Students have to feel and be seen as having merited being admitted to the Ph.D. program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the students who finish Fisk master&rsquo;s degrees through the program, though, do continue across the bridge to Vanderbilt. {snip}</p>

		<p>Why not just employ a printing press and hand them out like water? &#8220;All those in line who are NOT straight, white, conservative, Christian or Jewish, male American citizens, please step to the front of the line and get your piece of paper. The rest of you will have to actually EARN it.&#8221;</p>
<p>My son-in-law will be getting his Ph.D. in Physics in a year (after EARNING two separate Masters in his field). He didn&rsquo;t need any &#8216;special mentoring and tutoring&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And if &#8216;historically black colleges&rsquo; (as opposed to what - &#8216;historically white colleges&rsquo;?) are supposed to be so great for minorities, why do they &#8220;NOT have the full breadth of undergraduate curricular offerings&rdquo; to prepare students for doctoral programs&#8221;?</p>

How can we dumb down physics?</p>
<p>Maybe we can start by saying heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. As an example, from now on, a brick falls faster than a penny.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In 2008, only 12 American blacks got PhDs in physics.&#8221; </p>
<p>Then I think we can safely assume there were probably zero blacks who earned a PHD in physics.</p>
<p>Sorry, but every accomplishment that&rsquo;s highlighted claiming a breakthrough by blacks has some kind of chicanery behind it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I care, however, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect me.  If there are firms or corrupt universities that would pay these people, fine.  But I wouldn&rsquo;t hire them if they would work for minimum wage. </p>

		<p>I will explain this so even a Liberal PhD can understand. The  minimum I.Q. necessary to gain a doctorate in physics is about 130. Some Blacks do have this much, but if they do, they realize that they will be competing with other Minorities that have I.Q.&rsquo;s well in excess of 150. Therefore, they conclude that they will be better served by entering law, management, Education, medicine, etc. where they won&rsquo;t have to compete with Minority geniuses. In these fields, their intelligence is about average and they will have Minority status, a winning combination.</p>

		<p>   Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how they assume that the goal is to get minorities PHD&rsquo;s and not one mention of trying to get the best qualified and most intelligent students PHD&rsquo;s?  It&rsquo;s now such an ingrained part of our culture that we can&rsquo;t help the smartest, or make grants and awards based on who is smartest, but must decide solely on what is &#8220;fair&#8221; to minorities.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ll probably showcase all twelve on television so as to promote the impression that black geniuses abound everywhere. Media already portrays them as scientists, doctors, computer geeks and other great thinkers. And of that twelve, how many are really mulatto types?</p>

		<p>This should make you feel real good&hellip; Just a peek at what will happen when Obama&rsquo;s takeover of the health care industry. Many doctors will opt out of the mandated lowered Medicare payments they will receive, will not treat Meidcare patients, or get out of treating patients altogether. Therefore, we will graduate doctors with much lower standards, and even more likely will import many doctors with lower standards. Isn&rsquo;t the future looking bright?</p>

		<p>Most blacks that I have known with higher education in the hard sciences are from Africa. I don&rsquo;t know if there really is an IQ difference among the races, however, one nedds to take into account the people who were enslaved, probably the from the lowest rung of society and wouldn&rsquo;t that explain the IQ differences in the US? The Anglo Saxons that came here were the thinkers and the adventurers and the same goes for the Asians. The article doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the countries of origin of these black PhD&rsquo;s in physics. As an aside Jews may not the most intelligent people, however, after so many countries kicking them out, Spain, Turkey, England, Germany, Austria etc, only the smart survived altering their gene pool. </p>

		<p>To #13:<br>
Personal observation: I majored in physics as did  people whose I.Q. was known to me. Two with less than 125 were not able to get a bacherlors degree. Three who got Ph.D&rsquo;s within 4 years, had over 140. Two, with I.Q.&rsquo;s in the 130&rsquo;s, eventually got their Phd after years of part time study from less than prestigious institutions. I grant that this is not a large enough sample to be conclusive, but I think my estimate is reasonable. More ample data would change my opinion.</p>

		<p>I have a B.S. in Physics and years ago I was working towards a Masters at night after work.  The University that I was attending had only allowed about five or six students to enter the Ph.D program in twenty years.</p>
<p>I had been studying with a black student, who was a competent student as well as a nice guy, but I was shocked to hear that he was asked to enter the Ph.D program.</p>
<p>When he told me that he was in the program, he said, &#8220;why don&rsquo;t you ask to enter the program and we&rsquo;ll both earn our Ph.D&rsquo;s&#8221;.  I replied that I would never make it (that 135 IQ thing&hellip;).  He answered, &#8220;they give me the questions and answers for each test, all I have to do is ask for them&#8221;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s that darn racist math. And all the &#8216;structural racism&rsquo; at america&rsquo;s premier colleges. All of whom are overwhelmingly run by liberal special interest groups and who value diversity (discrimination against white men) and who practice affirmative action, use selective scholarships, and recruit non-whites for both their students, and employment at the university itself. </p>

		<p>The Blacks with PhDs in Physics will, hopefully, be adequate trained for teaching freshmen and sophomores.  Perhaps in lieu of original research they can write lab manuals or do some administrative tasks.  They will do that for 30 years and retire.</p>

		<p>To #14:</p>
<p>According to &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221;, Ashkenazi Jews have the highest IQ of any ethnic group. No surprise, then, that they are represented so heavily in professions such as medicine and law, as well as math and physics, e.g. Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman. 12 black PhDs out of 905 is 1.3%, about one-tenth their representation in the general population, which might be about right given their lower average intelligence. Remember, however, that averages and standard deviations say nothing about individuals, and due to the distribution of IQs, there will be some blacks who do have the ability to comprehend high-level physics, and to those who do, I extend my congratulations and best wishes. The tragedy is that Affirmative Action (a euphemism for discrimination against whites and Asians) forever casts doubt on their achievements. Some older blacks such as Thomas Sowell and Walter E. Williams have commented that they were fortunate to have earned their PhDs prior to Affirmative Action.</p>
