			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, March 22, 2010 (scroll down)</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Friday, three allies in the House of Representatives announced the formation of a new caucus to focus on the nexus between illegal immigration and unemployment in America. Headed by Reps. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Sue Myrick (R-NC), and Gary Miller (R-C), the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus consists of 40 Members from both sides of the aisle, who will work to highlight the link between illegal immigration and record unemployment in the United States. As the official unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent and the underemployed rate around 25 percent, these Members hope to promote immigration enforcement and getting Americans back to work.</p>
<p>Commenting on the new House caucus, Rep. Lamar Smith, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, said: &#8220;If the immigration laws we have on the books were enforced, we could cut unemployment in half.&#8221; Rep Myrick noted that employment is the main magnet that draws illegal workers to the United States. &#8220;By encouraging employers to use E-Verify and increasing worksite enforcement,&#8221; Myrick said, &#8220;we make sure that Americans and legal immigrants are able to get back to work.&#8221; Rep. Miller commented on his state of California and the enormous impact illegal immigration has had there. &#8220;Although 2.2 million Californians are unemployed, nearly 1.9 million illegal immigrants are employed,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;This is simply unacceptable and is an affront to unemployed American and legal workers.&#8221; (Press Release, March 19, 2010).

		<p>I say we (well, one of our sympathizers whose name isn&rsquo;t an instant red flag to many people) should begin a grass-roots program of economic patriotism to boycott businesses that hire illegals or export jobs.  (This could even get a lot of blacks on our side, which is why it shouldn&rsquo;t be lead by a highly visible Amrener.)<br>

		<p>RandyB, most American blacks, like Carol Swaine, oppose illegal immigration.  That&rsquo;s one issue where I can agree with them.  Black Americans aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, and illegal immigrants are doing jobs black Americans are certainly able to do.  The black leadership is as traitorous as the white leadership in favoring illegal alien amnesty.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m happy to see my Representative on the list. He&rsquo;s been an ally in the fight against illegal immigration, but I&rsquo;m still waiting for a knight in shining armor who&rsquo;ll stand up and speak out against the millions of lawbreakers who are about to be forgiven with amnesty and citizenship when those who do it right must continue to wait. I want someone to tell the truch about this second great travesty about to be unloaded on the American taxpayer. I&rsquo;m not surprised that Ron Paul&rsquo;s name doesn&rsquo;t appear ont he list. He might have a lot of good points, but the effects of illegal immigration is high on his list of priorities.</p>
