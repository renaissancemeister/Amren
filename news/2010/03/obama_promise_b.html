<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20100313/US.Obama.Education/">Obama Promise: Brighter Education Futures for Kids</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dorie Turner, Comcast News, March 14, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is promising parents and their kids that with his administration&rsquo;s help they will have better teachers in improved schools so U.S. students can make up for academic ground lost against youngsters in other countries.</p>
<p>A plan to overhaul the 2002 education law championed by President George W. Bush was unveiled by the Obama administration Saturday in hopes of replacing a system that in the last decade has tagged more than a third of schools as failing and created a hodgepodge of sometimes weak academic standards among states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the proposed dismantling of the No Child Left Behind law, education officials would move away from punishing schools that don&rsquo;t meet benchmarks and focus on rewarding schools for progress, particularly with poor and minority students. Obama intends to send a rewrite to Congress on Monday of the law.</p>
<p>The proposed changes call for states to adopt standards that ensure students are ready for college or a career rather than grade-level proficiency  &mdash;  the focus of the current law.</p>
<p>The blueprint also would allow states to use subjects other than reading and mathematics as part of their measurements for meeting federal goals, pleasing many education groups that have said No Child Left Behind encouraged teachers not to focus on history, art, science, social studies and other important subjects.</p>
<p>And, for the first time in 45 years, the White House is proposing a $4 billion increase in federal education spending, most of which would go to increase the competition among states for grant money and move away from formula-based funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few other highlights from the blueprint:</p>
<p>* By 2020, all students graduating from high school would need to be ready for college or a career. That&rsquo;s a shift away from the current law, which calls for all students to be performing at grade level in reading and math by 2014.</p>
<p>* Give more rewards  &mdash;  money and flexibility  &mdash;  to high-poverty schools that are seeing big gains in student achievement and use them as a model for other schools in low-income neighborhoods that struggle with performance.</p>
<p>* Punish the lowest-performing 5 percent of schools using aggressive measures, such as having the state take over federal funding for poor students, replacing the principal and half the teaching staff or closing the school altogether.</p>
<p>* Duncan has said the name No Child Left Behind will be dropped because it is associated with a harsh law that punishes schools for not reaching benchmarks even if they&rsquo;ve made big gains. He said the administration will work with Congress to come up with a new name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s first federal education law  &mdash;  Elementary and Secondary Education Act  &mdash;  was passed in 1965 as part of Lyndon B. Johnson&rsquo;s war on poverty. The law has been reauthorized several times since, most recently in 2001 under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>It was criticized by educators for focusing too much on testing and not enough on learning. Daniel Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, said he is glad to see No Child Left Behind go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re delighted over that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have not been a fan of No Child Left Behind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re going to reward mostly minority (read: black and Hispanic) schools that show improvement, but you eviscerate the standards to tell you if and how there is improvement, which Obama&rsquo;s reforms promise to do, then what you&rsquo;re left with is nothing more than dumping money on black and Hispanic schools for its own sake.</p>
<p><i>By 2020, all students graduating from high school would need to be ready for college or a career.</i></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the idea of high school anyway?  Either you go to college or to work after you&rsquo;ve graduated.  Unless alien abduction has become a credible third option while I wasn&rsquo;t looking.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;d like more emphasis on career education in high schools, because not everyone is college material.  However, the weasel words are &#8220;college or career,&#8221; meaning either one.  I imagine the emphasis under these reforms, as they are now, is college.  Because there are no real careers out there for those with only a high school education   &mdash;   You&rsquo;re in direct competition with the Hispanic cheap labor that the Republocrats love so much.</p>

		<p>Finally, one thing I can agree with from Obama.  No Child Left Alone (what it should be called) is a failure.  Now if the feds would just get rid of the Department of Education altogether, we could have some real progress in this country.</p>

<p>The above should read, &#8220;&#8221;better education, futures for black kids,&#8221; because EVERY SINGLE one of his pet proposals is designed to aid blacks somehow.  At least that&rsquo;s his intent.</p>
<p>When this fails to elevate blacks, he won&rsquo;t then finally admit their problem is low intellect, he will just blame something else.  This will go on forever.  The only way it will stop is if the schools are able to effectively cheat on black performance and not get caught at it.  Then when blacks fail to meet normal work requirements like reading and math, it will be blamed on systemic racism.</p>

<p>The proposed changes call for states to adopt standards that ensure students are ready for college or a career rather than grade-level proficiency &mdash; the focus of the current law.</p>
<p>Ironically, I think there is much here for Amren readers to like.  First, rejecting the requirement that <i>all</i> students meet grade-level proficiency no longer requires us to believe the lie that all students can achieve the same level of intellectual proficiency.  Second, rewarding schools that make &#8220;progress&#8221; with their poor and minority students again rejects the unrealistic expectation that these students can perform at the same level of other students.  They only need to &#8220;progress.&#8221;  Perhaps these new standards will lead to less agonizing over the &#8220;achievement gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it is also true that Obama&rsquo;s proposed revisions represent a lowering of standards.  Replacing a clearly-defined grade-level proficiency criterion for a nebulous requirement that the student be &#8220;ready&#8221; for college or a career leaves open the possibility that the standards for being &#8220;ready&#8221; for these things can steadily decline over the years, which it inevitably will given the changing demographic of the US.  In twenty years, No Child Left Behind will label schools successful because they make barely literate students &#8220;ready&#8221; for college.  It will then be up to the colleges to provide them with remedial education in math and reading and writing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing some strange things about &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221;.  I have a friend whose kid goes to a school that&rsquo;s about 30 percent black in SC. She says her kid only has 3 subjects for the term and doesn&rsquo;t have any homework because the school wants as few grades as possible to record for each student for as few classes as possible.  Before each test they go over the questions that are actually on the test and tell them the answers.  It&rsquo;s outrageous.  The school is only concerned about maintaining federal funding not about education.     </p>

		<p>In other words, another &#8220;education reform&#8221; program is declared an utter failure. No matter: they&rsquo;ll just replace it with another, and another, and another. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if any of the programs work or not, as long as the pols pretend to be working on the problem and as long as the American public goes along with the charade. </p>
<p>Remember Bush #1&rsquo;s program, called &#8220;America 2000?&#8221; And then Clinton&rsquo;s program, then Bush #2&rsquo;s &#8220;No Child Left Behind,&#8221; and now Obama&rsquo;s program. Each one declared a failure by its successor, but no problem, they&rsquo;ll each haul out their own &#8220;reforms.&#8221; It&rsquo;s an endless cycle.</p>
<p>Actually, as the article notes, the cycle goes all the way back to the &#8220;nation&rsquo;s first federal education law &mdash; Elementary and Secondary Education Act&#8221;  that was passed in 1965 by Lyndon B. Johnson (which was as big a failure as his war on poverty).</p>
<p><i>Punish the lowest-performing 5 percent of schools using aggressive measures, such as having the state take over federal funding for poor students, replacing the principal and half the teaching staff or closing the school altogether.</i></p>
<p>Riiiiiight, like I believe that will ever happen. Besides, it contradicts a paragraph from earlier in the very same article, which reads:</p>
<p><i>In the proposed dismantling of the No Child Left Behind law, education officials would move away from punishing schools that don&rsquo;t meet benchmarks and focus on rewarding schools for progress</i></p>
<p>In comparing the declining standards of American schools with schools in other nations, will officials at least differentiate white and black schools, instead of lumping them together, which drags down the performance scores of American schools as a whole? No, for that would be racist! Differences between white and black schools can&rsquo;t even be noticed, except to claim a racist conspiracy against the black schools.</p>
<p><i> Duncan has said the name No Child Left Behind will be dropped because it is associated with a harsh law </i></p>
<p>I should think the name would be the most popular part of the old law, since it implies  that all students can perform equally well academically in all subjects  &mdash;  kind of like all runners crossing the finish line at exactly the same moment. No matter: I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll come up with an equally implausible name to replace it.</p>

		<p>No one will be sorry to see No Child Left Behind go but the proposed replacement won&rsquo;t work either.  Incompetent teachers are only half the problem (at most) in black majority schools.  The other half of the problem is the students and their parents, and there is nothing you can do about that, given that eugenics is off the table.</p>
<p>If you reward high poverty schools that see big gains in academic achievement don&rsquo;t be surprised if those big gains are achieved by rigging the tests.<br>

		<p>A better name for &#8220;No Child Left Behind,&#8221; is &#8220;No Child Gets Ahead.&#8221;  Our schools are so worried that no child be &#8220;left behind&#8221; that we are holding back our best and brightest.  </p>
<p>I currently teach mathematics at a college.  However, about 9 years ago I taught for one year at one of the local high schools.  At close to forty students in some of my classes with 10 or so Spanish speaking only students I had a lot of fun!   The mathematics teaching staff at the high school were minimally qualified.  The pressure, regulations, low pay, and constant harassment of the teaching staff by the students, parents, and administrators drive any qualified person to find employment elsewhere ASAP.  </p>
<p>If we want better schools we need to make the prospect of teaching somewhat attractive. Teaching doesn&rsquo;t pay.  Right now, high school math teachers are dreaming of getting a job offer in industry.  High school math teachers are dreaming of a job that doesn&rsquo;t leave their stomach in knots at the end of each day.  If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go interview some.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there would be pressure to achieve, I&rsquo;m sure there already are politically correct efforts in that direction, to make testing go favorably for &#8216;underachieving&rsquo; schools. They already do cheat when it comes to funding. Student numbers are inflated. Funding is meted out on a per-pupil basis.</p>

Im sure many of these &#8220;teachers&#8221; are incompetent and will have a difficult time finding another job that pays as well. But maybe not. Just look at the president of the Detroit school board and how far he has gone with so little to offer. </p>
<p>If this plan is implemented, you can bet the farm that many of these lower performing schools will find &#8220;creative&#8221; ways to increase test scores. The only way to assure that there is no cheating is to bring in an independent tester, to re-test students, ANYTIME a schools scores appear to have  significantly (anything over 2% improvement)and &#8220;magically&#8221; improved. </p>

		<p>YES let&rsquo;s dump NCLB - it&rsquo;s the worst thing yet to happen in public education.  When I was teaching, we had SCRIPTED lesson plans, which meant every teacher within each specific grade level had to be doing and saying the exact same thing at the exact same time every single day.  I mean, how stupid can you get?  There was no time to help individual students - we were far too busy either scripting or testing.  Dumb, dumb, and dumber.  And it SHOWS.</p>

		<p>I wish I had scripted lessons!  I don&rsquo;t have any textbooks at all, save for one subject.  Every night I correct assignments, write new lessons, and tests till the wee hours.  Then go back the next day and teach a class of 35 with 7 special ed kids.  Next year, to meet NCLB average yearly progress, 88 percent have to pass the state tests! In 2013, 100 percent must pass or you are a failing school!<br>
Every year the feds change the standards to cover for minority failings.  Every year, I have to remake my lessons to meet the new standards.  <br>
NCLB hurts the highest achievers by terrorizing teachers into spending most of their time remediating the bottom of the bell curve to get them to pass standard, while letting (white) kids with potential to learn more do busy work.<br>
It is hard to swim with such an anchor tied to you!</p>

		<p>A friend who used to teach in the L.A. public schools told me how the radically egalitarian NCLB led teachers to just give students the answers during tests and pass everyone. If that isn&rsquo;t marxist enough for Obama, I shudder to think what&rsquo;s coming. Why not just give everyone straight A&rsquo;s and not bother holding classes at all? </p>

As I remember it, test scores actually rose under No Child Left Behind.</p>
<p>The attack on NCLB was from a coalition of teachers unions (who don&rsquo;t like to be told how to do anything) and the leftists who hated President Bush and knee-jerk denounced everything he did.</p>
<p>The affect was to make NCLB look like it was hated and reviled by everyone when it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now they get to do away with it. However, they have to replace it with yet another hair brained liberal education theory.</p>
<p>Only time will prove which educational system works best but in the meantime, we&rsquo;re going to lose another generation of children to another failed liberal theory.<br>

		<p>No amount of money and supplies thrown into schools will make a difference. For generations, students armed only with a pencil, a Big Chief tablet and a loving teacher succeeded. Perhaps because children knew and obeyed the rules and classes were not interrupted to deal with non-English speaking students, gang members, and social dropouts. Teachers are to be praised for going into the battle zones that schools have become today. If the will to learn is not present in a student, no amount of fancy gadgets will help. And, do all students need to aspire to college? No! Where are the trade schools that used to be a wonderful source for students who truly weren&rsquo;t college material, but who loved to fix cars, become carpenters and electricians, study plumbing, etc? These are the jobs now snapped up by illegal aliens because we are fed the lie that they are the jobs Americans &#8220;won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; Students are told that college must be their goal. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I built a new house, but I can honestly say, not a worker on the job was anything but a legal, loyal, taxpaying, voting American. How I would love to go back thirty years to THAT USA. Why not push for the trade schools of old and pass along to students that not everyone needs to attend college to succeed?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;When I was teaching, we had SCRIPTED lesson plans, which meant every teacher within each specific grade level had to be doing and saying the exact same thing at the exact same time every single day&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Former Teacher:</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, this program goes by the name &#8216;Open Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I believe scripted programs were introduced because the quality of teachers has sunk so low.</p>
<p>To appease the non-White activists&rsquo; demands for teachers who &#8216;look like the students&rsquo;, many many non-White &#8216;teachers&rsquo; were shoved through ed school (after &#8216;earning&rsquo; a degree in ethnic studies) or shoved through an elementary ed program.</p>
<p>Teachers qualification tests are a joke  &mdash;  they have to be to qualify poorly-educated, barely literate non-White teachers, many of whom still cannot pass the 5th-grade or lower reading and math test.</p>
<p>That most non-White teachers are barely literate is not a secret to the school district, shown by the fact that they keep re-defining what is meant by &#8216;highly qualified&rsquo;, one of NCLBs mandates.  To release a non-White teacher during his probationary period is akin to running a noose up a flag pole  &mdash;  it invites lawsuits from every corner of the non-White activist sphere with claims of &#8216;racism&rsquo; and/or &#8216;favoritism&rsquo; toward White teachers.</p>
<p>Seniority rules dictate job placement, something the district and state have been trying to over-rule for decades.  Most of us Whites put in a few required years at a majority non-White school and then transfer out ASAP to better schools. The aggravation and constant cries of &#8216;racist&rsquo; get to just about anyone after enough time.</p>
<p>Non-White schools are filled with lemon teacher who are transferred around until they finally are placed in a wretched school with the administrative intention that they&rsquo;ll quit or retire.  These schools are also filled with Teach for America-types, interns, probationary teachers waiting for tenure until they are able to transfer out and long-term subs.  </p>
<p>By then the activists scream that the better teachers are out in the suburbs at the better schools and that &#8216;they&rsquo; should be mandated to transfer to majority non-White, inner-city schools.  Most White teachers threaten to quit whenever this is brought up.  So far, the teachers unions have fought mandated transfers (one of the few good things unions do in the name of teachers rights which they&rsquo;re supposed to protect and enforce but don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a no-win situation for White teachers  &mdash;  in non-White schools we &#8216;don&rsquo;t look like the students&rsquo; and/or don&rsquo;t understand &#8216;their unique culture&rsquo; (hence the big-bucks, Jane Elliot-type,  multi-culti gulag re-education for White teachers).  If we are in a White school, it leaves the worst teachers to the lowest, most difficult students and activists scream that we must be placed there.</p>
<p>Even though the district is filled with useless idiots, those at the very top, who are hidden, are not  &mdash;  they toe the party line because they have to but well know the situation (I&rsquo;m convinced) and know keeping the state and auditors off of their backs means test scores must rise yearly  &mdash;  by whatever means possible.</p>
<p>THIS is why mandated, strictly monitored scripted lessons were brought in.  It is already a given that most non-White teachers are poorly educated and cannot do much as far as teaching, but they can read (we hope) a very elementary lesson plan to students and make sure they put something in their workbooks. </p>

		<p>Before each test they go over the questions that are actually on the test and tell them the answers. <br>
*********************<br>
Back when I was in school, if we got hold of a past test and studied up on just the answers, it was called cheating and was harshly punished. Now the teachers are doing this. Unbelievable!</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what new name they put on the new teaching experiment it&rsquo;s still not going to work. Every parent of a school-age white child should immediately remove them from public school. Send them to a private school, even if the only ones available in your area are church-based. There are Protestant as well as Catholic church schools. Home-schooling your children is even better, but I recognize that not every parent is able or qualified to do this. At any rate, unless your child&rsquo;s school is 90% or more white, (there aren&rsquo;t many left) remove your children. The loss of  white students in sudden droves is the one and only thing that will alert school districts to the fact that parents have a vested interest in their children&rsquo;s education and will make sacrifices to obtain it. The best thing in this country would be the total and utter collapse of the public school system. They obviously aren&rsquo;t teaching our children anything of any value anyway. The holding pens for the non-English-speaking children and future, Ebonics speaking prison inmates will probably last awhile longer, but we need not concern ourselves about those since the diplomas they churn out are already regarded by employers as laughable and worthless and no guarantee that their holders have anything resembling literacy.     </p>

		<p>What wasn&rsquo;t said in this article is the truth that No Child Left Behind failed in large part because Blacks and Hispanics have incorrigible learning ability that money couldn&rsquo;t remediate. Whites states with low expenditures on education but high SAT scores prove that assertion.</p>

		<p>You can bet your bippy our glorious communist leader is going to [CHANGE!!] the curriculum to fit his marxist ideals. This is just another one of Karl Marx&rsquo;s steps in the communist manifesto, the dumbing down of the masses, and indoctrinating them from day one of their education. I&rsquo;m sure it will seem they have improved, once they teach end results at about a third grade equivilency. You just can&rsquo;t make a silk purse from a sows ear. </p>

		<p>Interesting. Now how, pray tell, will Obama ensure that all Blacks not only graduate, but graduate with high marks in achievement tests? Other than by lowering the bar further for Blacks. Say, 35% of passing grade given for Blacks being Blacks. Another 35% grade increase if they even show up for classes. The remaining 30% credit being considered &#8220;good will&#8221; to help them along.</p>

		<p>To &#8220;Former Teacher&#8221;, I say thanks for a very enlightening post. I can see WHY you&rsquo;re a former teacher and wonder WHY any White person would want to even try to teach non-Whites, given their mentality and tendency to be problem students.</p>
<p>I would love to have you enlighten us with how much History is changed (perverted?) for the sake of appeasing the hurt feelings of non-White races who&rsquo;s history is a long record of non-accomplishment. I might be wrong, but get the impression as taught, History has been changed to radically downplay what our White ancestors in Europe and later America discovered, invented, researched or accomplished. Would you enlighten us please?</p>

<p>Anon #20:</p>
<p>There are many fine, accredited K-12 schools on-line.  My son was in one for two years  &mdash;  while he was there, the student body doubled in two months and then doubled again two months later.  They were rapidly hiring teachers as fast as they could  &mdash;  many of them were sharp, older, old-school-type retired teachers who could work from home.</p>
<p>The books were sent out free, teachers met the students on-line for live lessons, and were always available to answer questions.  Assignments were handed in on-line except for larger projects that we sent ins  &mdash;  with a pre-paid envelope or box provided by the school.</p>
<p>If your child wants to participate in after-school sports at the local school, it is his legal right.  The government schools took the home-schoolers to court to prevent this and lost as the court ruled that home schooled parents are still required to pay taxes that support the local schools.  </p>
<p>The home school cohort I was in met once a month for picnics, activities and field trips with our so we could meet and connect with other parents and kids, the teachers and staff.  </p>
<p>The kids and their parents were highly intelligent and most told me horror stories of how their children had had miserable experiences at the local school  &mdash;  mostly their high-achieving children were held back, ignored and their needs were not being met by being forced into mainstreamed classes that catered to the underperforming at the expense of everyone else.</p>
<p>The home schooled-types of kids I met, Asians, Whites and, increasingly East Indians were motivated, highly g loaded, focused, curious, intellectual, some were near geniuses  &mdash;   are exactly the ones that should be given the lion&rsquo;s share of  the educational resources  &mdash;  instead their AP and honors classes are cut, they are ignored and tossed aside in favor of lower or non-performing, low IQd students.</p>
<p>Outside of the classroom they are robbed, assaulted, taunted as &#8216;nerds&rsquo; and &#8216;losers&rsquo; by non-Whites.</p>
<p>I know because my son fit this profile and was floundering until we pulled him out of the local middle school.  After two years, he chose to return to high school because of the AP science classes, especially the ones that require labs such as chemistry.  He is now around other students like him, away from the mainstream, and is with excellent teachers who understand the needs of highly intelligent students and won&rsquo;t use him to &#8216;help others catch up&rsquo; as was done in middle and elementary schools, and against my wishes.  </p>
<p>I once told the middle school principal (who only bothered to contact me when the school wanted to use him as a tutor or right before testing to make sure he was going to show up for the state tests.) that if he is going to be used to tutor others, he should be paid a part of the teacher&rsquo;s salary.</p>
<p>He will not be taking the state tests again this year as is my legal right as a parent.  Since the school administration refuses to acknowledge or offer any praise, rewards, recognition or accolades for its high performing students, they can reap their test scores off of the lower-performing mainstream kids, not mine with near perfect scores. </p>
<p>He and other high achieving, high performing students only seem to be important to the school when the state tests roll around.</p>

		<p>I have a feeling these standards are going to be more qualitative as opposed to the rigged quantitative measures in NCLB.  Perhaps they&rsquo;re realizing that no matter what they do, no matter how many billions of dollars they waste on public education, they will never be able to adequately raise the scores of black and latino students.  The more that time passes the more the egalitarian myths of the left are crumbling.</p>

<p>No Child Left Behind is one GWB legacy that liberals are quite justified in attacking. If Obama scraps NCLB, I might even have to say something nice about him for once&hellip; <br>
 <br>
Unless of course he replaces it with something even dumber and even more Utopian than NCLB&hellip; <br>
 <br>
&hellip;Which, being Obama, he almost certainly will. <br>
 <br>
&#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; announced its unworkability in its very title. Leave NO children behind? Really? NONE of them? Not even the total morons? Not even the ones who show up at school only long enough to threaten and assault their teachers? Not even the ones for whom the classroom is just a good venue for selling drugs? <br>
 <br>
Some little-known historical background no NCLB: Rumor has it the Bush Admin ended up naming the program &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; because their working titles   &mdash;    &#8220;Dump All Standards So Low-Achieving Minority Kids Will Feel Better About Themselves&#8221; and &#8220;Promote Every Last Black And Brown Gang-Banger Or Lose Your Funding&#8221;   &mdash;   weren&rsquo;t testing too well with the focus groups. </p>

<p>One NCLB provision that definitely <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be left out of the Maobama plan is the requirement for schools to give students&rsquo; personal data to military recruiters. At any cost, Uncle Sam&rsquo;s war machine must have a steady supply of bullet-stoppers. Yet another reason to avoid public schools.</p>

<p>You make a good point.  First Lady Michelle Obama said when she started her anti-obesity campaign that childhood obesity is a national security issue, because obese 7-year olds in 2010 will be obese 17-year olds in 2020 that can&rsquo;t join the Army to fight AQ.  (Does this mean her husband is going to leave us in Iraq and Afghanistan for a lot longer than he&rsquo;s putting on?)  I thought to myself that this is going to make his kook left fringe base and the Markos &#8220;Kos&#8221; types have a bovine unit, because her husband got all their votes with all his anti-military rhetoric.  Now his wife thinks that the only problem with childhood obesity now is the Army&rsquo;s staffing concerns in 2020.  </p>
<p>If schools can still forward info about their teenage students to the Armed Forces, won&rsquo;t this exacerbate the Kos-White House split?</p>

<p>&#8221;.. please furnish links to any others&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;One NCLB provision that definitely won&rsquo;t be left out of the Maobama plan is the requirement for schools to give students&rsquo; personal data to military recruiters&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maobama expands the USGs foreign wars and the hypocritical left is silent.  You can bet the children of the elite won&rsquo;t be used as cannon fodder  &mdash;  but they should be.</p>
<p>Here are my two favorite quotes from the late (love him or hate him) Birdman Bryant:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I believe that if a politician favors war, he should be in the first assault wave, and that if he votes for war, he should remain in the front lines until the war is over.</p>
<p>Any adult citizen who publicly advocates for war should be immediately subject to the draft, no matter what his age&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>My extended family has made a pact that none of our young males (or females) will  be sent into a meat-grinder 9,000 nautical miles from our home  &mdash;   to come home in a body bag while the children of the war mongers sit in seats at Harvard and Yale.</p>
<p>We will not allow our sons to be conscripted as cannon fodder into an utterly useless war by a government that treats our males like garbage, debases them, locks them out of colleges and careers and then consigns them into its fighting arm.  Fight to preserve this government and under obama as the commander in chief?  Not in this lifetime or any other.</p>
<p>I imagine the military would not like a draft as incidences of fragging would increase.  One of the financial magazines I read advises investing in drones as the military will be using more of these to avoid an extremely unpopular draft as the war continues to expand.</p>
<p>As for online schools: </p>
<p>Kaplan online advertises: &#8220;Fast Admissions for new Students 100% Free Enrollment.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/yajlpvw</p>
<p>California Virtual Academy advertises:&#8221; A high-quality, tuition-free public education, an individualized approach to learning, California-credentialed teachers and is a WASC-accredited school.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/yevwu7y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yevwu7y</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip; Because they are part of the public school system, the California Virtual Academies are tuition free. The entire curriculum and a loaner computer and printer are provided at no cost, and enrolled families receive a stipend for<br>
Internet access&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If it is possible, get your kids out of the government schools, do it now and don&rsquo;t look back.  Several churches in my area are forming on-line homeschooling cohorts with the kids meeting in a group at the church or in private homes for parents who have child care issues. </p>
<p>There are MANY homeschooling resources and support services on-line as well  &mdash;  my cohort had a parent group so we were able to exchange schooling information and arrange get-togethers for our kids.</p>
<p>Neither I nor my son regret even one minute of the time he spent being home schooled  &mdash;  my son was happy not to have to put up with the drivel at school and teachers he felt were unintelligent and uneducated (with good reason).  We were also able to spend a lot more time together as a family and school him in our beliefs and ideals and not those of the current anti-White, Freudo-Marxist school curriculum.</p>
