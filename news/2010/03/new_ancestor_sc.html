<h1>New Ancestor? Scientists Ponder DNA From Siberia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Malcolm Ritter, Google News, March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the latest use of DNA to investigate the story of humankind, scientists have decoded genetic material from an unidentified human ancestor that lived in Siberia and concluded it might be a new member of the human family tree.</p>
<p>The DNA doesn&rsquo;t match modern humans or Neanderthals, two species that lived in that area around the same time  &mdash;  30,000 to 50,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Instead, it suggests the Siberian species lineage split off from the branch leading to moderns and Neanderthals a million years ago, the researchers calculated. And they said that doesn&rsquo;t seem to match the history of human ancestors previously known from fossils.</p>
<p>So the Siberian species may be brand new, although the scientists cautioned that they&rsquo;re not ready to make that claim yet.</p>
<p>Other experts agreed that while the Siberian species may be new, the case is far from proven.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The researchers, who say the Siberian species is not a direct ancestor of modern-day people, hope further genetic analysis will show if it&rsquo;s a new species. Some experts are skeptical about whether such analysis will resolve that.</p>
<p>In any case, the finding emphasizes that quite unlike the present day, anatomically modern humans have often lived alongside their evolutionary relatives, one expert said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new work, published online Wednesday by the journal Nature, is reported by Johannes Krause and Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Their analysis indicated the Siberian species last shared a common ancestor with modern humans and Neanderthals about 1 million years ago. That in turn suggested there was a previously unrecognized migration out of Africa around that time, they said.</p>
<p>The work decoded the complete set of DNA from mitochondria, the power plants of cells. That&rsquo;s different from the better-known DNA that comes from cell nuclei and determines things like eye color. Paabo said the researchers are working to decode nuclear DNA from the Siberian species. That will reveal whether it was closely related to Neanderthals or today&rsquo;s humans, and answer questions like whether it interbred with Neanderthals or ancestors of modern-day people, he said.</p>

		<p>With so much unknown about human racial evolution, it would be prudent and scientifically justified to stop mixing together people from around the world into one big melting pot. Given that whites are a small and getting smaller racial group, it should be recognized that we would be overwhelmed in a global racial mixture.</p>

<p>Yes, and since political correctness has a firm grasp on all the fields of science, we can be assured that if the information doesn&rsquo;t square with their version of political correctness they&rsquo;ll do as they always do:  Lie about it and distort their findings to fit the lie of diversity.</p>
<p>Ask Dr. Watson what kind of pressure was put on him to retract his truthful assertions and lie about his findings in the field of human intelligence.</p>
<p>And, it is these same disgusting scientific liars that have the nerve to talk about the lies told by the Nazis when they&rsquo;re doing exactly the same thing.</p>

		<p>So we&rsquo;ve got the article about the book written about white people by the black &#8220;professor&#8221; saying we share 99.99% of our genetic code.  We know that we share 98% of our code with chimpanzees. </p>
<p>I wonder where these ancient human species fall in the spectrum?  I&rsquo;m no gene scientist but it stands to reason that a branch on the tree between us and chimps is gonna be somewhere between 98% and 99.99%.  </p>
<p>If we share more than 98% of our genetic code with this ancient ancestor, and it&rsquo;s enough of a difference for separate species designation, what does that say for the genetic differences between the races that the leftists swear don&rsquo;t exist but we all know do anyway?</p>

		<p>Not all scientists with standing relevant to the issue <br>
accept the single origin Out of Africa theory. </p>

		<p>I recall just recently when they confirmed that the discovery of the &#8220;smurf&#8221; people, little now-gone [?] lilliputians living on that remote island in what is now Indonesia, was indeed fact.</p>
<p>An entire &#8220;species&#8221; related to modern man and NOT even known about until recently. And existing side-by-side with modern humans for a long time, just recently gone extinct [?]. </p>
<p>Much more of this is out there, and we have not ever known about it.</p>

<p><br>
Quite unlike the present?  Looking around me, and judging by what I see, I would say it is very much like the present day, where we are living among our evolutionary relatives!</p>
<p>Of course, political correctness would never allow that to be said of the present, but it is alright to ascribe it to some dim time in the ancient past.</p>

		<p>I am delighted every time I hear that there&rsquo;s yet another ancestor of modern humanity.  It gives more and more credence to the fact that we ARE different racially; that we DID have different ancestors, and that we should not be mixing the races unless we want to lose what time has both determined and evolved.  Maybe the Siberian ancestor was the one for the Asians.</p>

		<p>Science-wise, I think all life had the same original ancestors - some water bubbles and amino acids or something, just that there have been splits along the way. So, that&rsquo;s why we have a lot in common with yeast, sponges, etc.</p>
<p>So, we share a common ancestor with blacks (as well as chimps), but I think this ancestor goes back farther than the PC media wants to admit. </p>
<p>Maybe an expert can chime in.</p>
<p>If you are Christian then you are probably aware of the many strong arguments that establish that blacks are not descended from Adam (for one: read on google books Alexander Winchell&rsquo;s Preadamites; or a Demonstration of the Existence of Men Before Adam).  </p>
<p>Winchell&rsquo;s argument and others all lead to the determination that blacks do not have souls.</p>
<p>In any case, religious or not, the evidence is mounting that the differences between White and black _are_ important.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this new find can shed light on the various early splits from the monkey world. We may find our own ancestors one day.<br>

		<p>Could this be a matter in which a little fact threatens a big<br>
theory?  Out of Africa (OoA) theory has been long questioned by several scientists of standing within the broad area of human evolution, even if the vast majority consider OoA no longer an hypothesis but rather an established theory .  In science it is shaky to put too much stock in a mere &#8220;show of hands&#8221; as an indicator of truth.   I have never seen or heard of a reasoned and informed disputation held between questioners and adherents<br>
of the OaA model.  Migrations OoA likely encountered interfertile creatures in place in the areas arrived at.  What is the story  &mdash;  all genocide and no sex? </p>
