<h1>PBS Host Smiley Calls Meeting to Urge Black Agenda</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Google News, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two months after ending his annual State of the Black Union conference, Tavis Smiley is gathering African-American advocates to press the case for a &#8220;black agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision was motivated by what Smiley called recent statements from some black leaders downplaying the need for President Barack Obama to specifically help African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was compelled to do it because of this debate,&#8221; the activist and PBS talk show host said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The panel discussion will be March 20 at Chicago State University. Panelists include advertising pioneer Tom Burrell, professors Michael Eric Dyson and Cornel West, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Bennett College President Julianne Malveaux.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some black politicians and activists have recently begun to question Obama&rsquo;s longtime stance that helping the overall economy will improve the fortunes of blacks who are disproportionately poor and unemployed.</p>
<p>West, for example, gave Obama a grade of C minus on policies and priorities focused on poor and working people, saying, &#8220;He has really not come through in any substantial and significant way.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Smiley] said that the Obama campaign and black leaders asked African-Americans for help during the election, but that &#8220;now that he&rsquo;s elected, what are black people being asked to do to hold him accountable to our agenda?&#8221;</p>

What exactly does Mr. Smiley expect President Obama can do?</p>
<p>Can the President make them employable or give them jobs? Is he asking for money and programs and what are these programs supposed to achieve?</p>
<p>Can someone give me a breakdown on what this black agenda is and what it&rsquo;s supposed to do?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Obama isn&rsquo;t doing enough to help blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s entire agenda is based in doing whatever is necessary to elevate blacks.  Only the least among the black population is unable to see this, which amounts to most of them.</p>
<p>Even Rush Limbaugh who is usually cautious about entering into the racial arena is saying that Obama&rsquo;s entire efforts are aimed at &#8220;helping the brothers.&#8221;  And, of course he&rsquo;s right.  Glenn Beck is aware of the true agenda also.  That&rsquo;s why he declared a while back that Obama was a racist.</p>
<p>Here we are on the brink of the greatest recession ever, critical joblessness, and this mentally challenged man is concentrating all his time and efforts&hellip;.as well as the Congress&rsquo; time an efforts&hellip;.in passing a pro-black health bill, while unemployment is soaring at 17.5% in real world terms.</p>
<p>This man is THE greatest danger this country has EVER faced, and it is deplorable that there are still a good number of whites who ignorantly support him.  Their punishment for their foolishness should be a conviction to serve time in the middle of a black neighborhood for the rest of their lives.</p>

		<p>I hope the Black Agenda includes demanding the powerful whites in the media and education &#8220;step down&#8221; and give up their  paychecks, jobs and careers to the &#8220;more deserving&#8221; afrothugs and gays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear Chris M, Keith O, Maureen D, Evan T, etc. all try  defend their jobs against the Diversity Demand.  Any defense they make will have White Privilege as its major premise, but they will say it in terms of how non raciss they are and how they passionately embrace diversity and are inclusively tolerant and how they hate Nazi FoxNews, Raciss Tea Parties, and Hateful Republicans.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t do them any good, because as hard as they deny it, they will still be white and therefore undeserving of any civil or human rights.</p>

An afrothugress woman was on O&rsquo;Reilly last night complaining about pro life ads. Dang, if an afrothugress want to abort their afrothug babies and help us slow down the rate of White minoritization, who should complain.</p>
<p>She went on about how students today all love tolerance and diversity.  Can&rsquo;t find full transcript, but see her incantations below:</p>

Women&rsquo;s Media Center vs. Focus on the Family <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 The liberal organization &#8220;Women&rsquo;s Media Center&#8221; has locked horns with the conservative group &#8220;Focus on the Family,&#8221; whose TV and Internet ads oppose abortion. The Factor was joined by WMC&rsquo;s Jehmu Green, who explained her opposition to the ads. &#8220;Focus on the Family,&#8221; Green complained, &#8220;is trying to lure people to their web site with benign ads. This is an intolerant, divisive, homophobic, anti-choice, anti-woman group, and these are not values that I grew up to believe and support. We are protesting Focus on the Family&rsquo;s agenda.&#8221; The Factor accused Green of attempting to suppress speech. &#8220;Focus on the Family has a right to say anything they want, but you want to shut down that message. This is a cowardly move - you don&rsquo;t want to debate, you want to shut this down.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>The Danger of a One Term Obama</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s racial radicalism and hatred for White America can play out through implicit actions that hurt Whites while he sells his policies as helping all Americans. Obama and Congress can run trillion dollar deficits that force some near future congresses to drastically raise taxes on working Whites and their wealthy Whites employers.  A White national population majority ensures that tax increases fall mostly on Whites. If Obama&rsquo;s borrowing and deficits help to transform America to the benefit of non whites while hurting Whites through egregious White taxation, then he did satisfy portions of the Black Agenda without naming it as such.  </p>
<p>Health reform requires cutting Medicare.  Whites are the majority of users and thus will be bearers of the brunt of cuts.  A cut to Medicare to help uninsureds is a race tax on Whites to pay for health care for newly insured non whites. </p>
<p>The problem only gets worse when Obama gives amnesty to illegal non white aliens, who will also get the right vote and right to health care as a part of the deal.  Unearned race privilege will have an entire new class of beneficiaries through non white amnesty and citizenship.</p>
<p>Tavis Smiley and the black leaders want Obama to have an explicit Black Agenda so that they can get for themselves the best political  appointments and governmental jobs (lifetime retirement pensions) while  administering the Agenda and thereby further entrenching their own black power, profit, privilege, and their ruling over Whites.</p>
<p>But Obama denied a second term as President has explosive potential for the Diversity movement.  If blacks are feeling in November 2012 that they were not helped enough by Obama toward the goal of race justice, they will blame Whites for Obama&rsquo;s lack of explicit support for the Black Agenda.  Even though his &#8220;we will transform America&#8221; is code for &#8220;we will overturn White Privilege by dismantling systemic and institutional racism,&#8221; blacks will want more direct and explicit race justice to show for their supporting Obama. Not inclined to blame their own black sistas and bruthas when they can instead blame, shame, and intimidate Whites, blacks will make White America the scapegoat for Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;not acting black enough.&#8221;   Obama&rsquo;s policy and political failures will be recast as hateful White Racism and evidence that White America isn&rsquo;t doing enough to foster Diversity and help minorities.  </p>
<p>Some will demand that Whites have their citizenships revoked, only to upon satisfactorily completing Tolerance Training that forces them to admit their cultural biases and race prejudices, and by demonstrating a measurable commitment to &#8220;passionately embracing Diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks will become convinced that Obama was on the verge of bringing about total race justice. They will demand that he needs a second term to get the job done because of the intractability of White Privilege.  &#8220;The road to progress is long, and Obama needs more that a scanty four years to lead us far enough down that road to make a difference for social justice.&#8221; </p>
<p>They will use the political trick of &#8220;projecting momentum,&#8221; as though the goal was about to be met, but evil forces stand as an obstacle to &#8220;finally doing the right thing.&#8221;  Direct financial slavery reparations will become that fad of the political primaries in 2011-12.  Blacks will campaign for Obama with the reparations message as their primary agitprop tool. Any White candidate who does not advocate for reparations will be smeared as a hateful raciss Nazi.   </p>
<p>If Obama is denied his second term, blacks will rise up in violence against White America for denying them the justice demanded by history.</p>
<p>Whoever is president on November 19, 2013 will give the 150th anniversary reading of Father Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address. The political campaign of 2012 will demand that &#8220;we must have our historic first African American President Obama reelected so  he can read the Gettysburg Address in 2013 and show how far we&rsquo;ve come, while also reminding us of how much more work we need to do in eradicating White Privilege by paying slavery reparations to African Americans, all of whom would have been brilliant philosophers and scientists if they had not been kidnapped and stolen from Africa by the blonde haired, blue eyed evil Europeans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama denied his &#8220;rightful second term&#8221; will come with certain black rioting, looting, robbing, raping, and murdering in November 2012 and February 2013.  This time, they won&rsquo;t burn down their own neighborhoods and businesses like they did in 1960&rsquo;s. They will burn down yours.<br>

		<p>Tavis Smiley has been putting on his little show on PBS for a number of years now.  He wants to BE somebody so badly that he will do ANYTHING for publicity, and staging this event is a prime example.  It isn&rsquo;t for Obama, it isn&rsquo;t for black people, it&rsquo;s for Tavis Smiley.  Make no mistake!</p>

		<p>Can someone give me a breakdown on what this black agenda is and what it&rsquo;s supposed to do?</p>
<p>Sure, in two (2) phases<br>
(1) wipe out all the whites<br>
(2) Except for those whites needed to support the blacks<br>
Or alternatively<br>
(1) take everything from whites by force<br>
(2) give everything to blacks</p>

		<p>Who didn&rsquo;t see this coming? All the people who truly believed (or listened to those who simply sold the bill of goods to those who they knew would believe) that Obama was going to pay their mortgage, buy their gas, etc., are wondering where their handouts are. They feel honestly and sincerely betrayed and abandoned because these bozos are ignorant enough to think he was actually going to do it.</p>
<p>All of us with even half a brain saw it coming. We knew a black president would do nothing but stir up blacks even more and cause even more racial strife in this country because there is no way to please most blacks other than giving (emphasis on GIVING) them everything they want, and even the President doesn&rsquo;t have the power to do that.</p>

		<p>The ONLY part of the odious Heath Care bill that I support is government-funded abortions.</p>
<p>To those of you I offend, I say too bad.   You can pay my California state tax bill, which has again increased to feed and educate the huge underclass.</p>
<p>In California, we have a fatherless, growing, welfare-funded, non-White class from which derive many violent criminals who attack us and over-fill our prisons.  As they are (r) driven, they refuse to limit the number of children they have,( as I have had to as a productive White)  &mdash;  that they cannot feed, house, clothe and/or educate, making the government, funded by us, the de-facto parent NOT parents, parent  &mdash;  as in single parent. </p>
<p> According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services:</p>
<p>Fatherless children are at a dramatically greater risk of drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, suicide, poor educational performance, teen pregnancy, and criminality.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/5akmfj" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/5akmfj</a></p>
<p>As the illegitimacy rate in the black community is approximately 70%, it seems that this is where smiley should be concentrating his efforts, not on looking toward more and bigger government to &#8216;save&rsquo; his people.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/yllwe22</p>
<p>What do you think this seething, White-hating underclass is going to do when the economy collapses and the welfare entitlements dry up?  They will go after &#8216;the rich&rsquo;, that is anyone with anything  &mdash;  many will unleash their pent up hatred of Whites, believing, as always, that we Whites are the cause of their poverty and failure. </p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local rag I receive for free, the editorial page (which I normally skip) had an article noting that Teen Pregnancy rates have fallen in California, which is good news for all of us.  The article went on to state that &#8216;experts&rsquo; believe this is due to the availability of state-funded abortions.  Thankfully they didn&rsquo;t report that it is the result of schools promoting abstinence and/or birth control education, which as far as I can see is an abysmal failure.</p>
<p>I do not like abortions; the idea of having to pay for them infuriates me, and I well understand the fine line between government-sponsored abortions and government-forced abortions.</p>
<p>But if that is what it takes to curtail teen pregnancies to single mothers, so be it.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree can pay my satanic California state tax bill or my daughter tuition bill which increased 30% this year.</p>
<p>My solution would be to require every female that accepts ANY form of taxpayer-funded welfare whatsoever be fitted with either an IUD or NorPlant.</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor himself said:  You do not have the right to bring child after child into the world and expect the rest of us to pay for them!</p>
<p>Our economy is collapsing in California and the jobless rate is over 20%, the productive class and businesses are being pushed out, yet the mantra at yesterday&rsquo;s Communist-run rallies to &#8216;protest against cuts to education&rsquo; was &#8216;Tax The Rich!&rsquo; and &#8216;Tax Businesses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before these &#8216;rallies&rsquo; become full-out anarchy and violent race-based riots.</p>

		<p>Most, if not all, of the people scheduled for Smiley&rsquo;s panel are race baiters who cry foul solely in order to bring fame and fortune to themselves.  Many blacks accept this; it&rsquo;s the way things have always operated in the black community.  You take what you can because everyone is trying to take from you.  <br>
Blacks under both colonalism and slavery have always whined and pleaded &#8220;Gimme!&#8221; from bwana and master.  Old habits die hard.</p>

<p>When the job of stealing all the White man&rsquo;s wealth is done those liberal Whites will be hunted too. They will all be betrayed when they become useless. Black people have a habit of lying and making false promises when it suits them, promises which are never ever kept. Just ask the liberal South Africans. Or just ask America&rsquo;s &#8216;first black president&rsquo;, Mr. Clinton and his wife.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it starts with blacks.  They always say we want &#8216;equality&rsquo; or &#8216;equal access to _______&rsquo;, but they are good at conning most whites who don&rsquo;t live around blacks into putting them into a position of power.  Once this black person gets power of some sort, he or she will then use this platform to push a black supremacist agenda and/or have pressure from blacks to push a black-power-get-back-at-whitey goal.  Happens everytime.  It&rsquo;s too bad most whites are so naive or they forget history.  You can&rsquo;t appease blacks or think they simply want &#8216;equality&rsquo; with whites.  It&rsquo;s always about getting our money, power, our children and our women.<br>
