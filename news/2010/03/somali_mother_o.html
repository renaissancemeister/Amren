			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Martin and Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), February 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Standing proudly with her arm draped over her 36in television, this is the Somali woman who must be given a council house even though she has no right to live in Britain.</p>
<p>Nimco Hassan Ibrahim  &mdash;  who lives with her four children on benefit handouts  &mdash;  was granted the right to the home by EU judges yesterday because she was once married to a Danish citizen who briefly worked in this country.</p>
<p>The landmark judgment means the 34-year-old migrant and her children will soon be packing up their impressive collection of furniture and electrical equipment when they are given a new house.</p>
<p>Although Miss Ibrahim claims her income support payments were suspended during the legal action, she has somehow bought a Playstation 3 games console, computer and a high-quality speaker system.</p>
<p>Equally impressive is the enormous sofa from which she watches TV each night. Lying on the floor in her lounge are some of the latest film releases  &mdash;  including a pirate DVD copy of the sci-fi movie Avatar.</p>
<p>And although she lives in a temporary accommodation in Harrow, Middlesex  &mdash;  funded by the local council  &mdash;  she has managed to install a high-speed internet connection.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, Mrs Ibrahim said: &#8216;I deserve to be given a proper house. This one is too small for all of us.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair that the council has put us up in temporary accommodation. It&rsquo;s not right that they have hounded us for four years. All these threats of eviction have made me feel very ill.</p>
<p>&#8216;The law says that I can get a better house so I&rsquo;m looking forward to a better life.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have suffered psychological problems because of all this.</p>
<p>&#8216;To be honest, I was expecting the worst from the court and I&rsquo;m relieved it has ended. Now I can enjoy my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Ibrahim does not work and spends her day looking after her children Abdirahman, 12, Abdifatah, 10, Deka, eight, and Mustapha, four. She refused to reveal how she could afford her electrical goods and furniture.</p>
<p>The landmark EU judgment opens the door for hundreds of thousands of unemployed foreigners to claim both state benefits and council or housing association homes.</p>
<p>In particular, it means migrant families from Poland and other Eastern European countries will for the first time have a right to council housing and state benefits even if they have worked for only a brief period in Britain.</p>
<p>It comes at a time of heavy demand for council housing from hard-pressed British families  &mdash;  and as ministers have been promising families in disaffected Labour heartlands that local people will have first call on council homes.</p>
<p>The judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said Mrs Ibrahim must be given a home because &#8216;a parent caring for the child of a migrant worker who is in education in the host member state has a right of residence in that state&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;That right is not conditional on the parent having sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Ibrahim fled war-torn Somalia to Ethiopia with her family when she was 15. She married Mohamed Yusuf in Ethiopia before the pair moved to Denmark where he holds citizenship.</p>
<p>The pair came to Britain seven years ago. After eight months working as a bus driver, Mr Yusuf began living on benefits. When they were stopped in March 2004, he left the country.</p>
<p>Mr Yusuf&rsquo;s departure ended Mrs Ibrahim&rsquo;s right to stay in the UK and her right to receive benefits, but six years later, she lives on £1,000 a month through child tax credits, child benefits and child disability allowance.</p>
<p>Her accommodation is paid for and she also uses the NHS, even though she is not entitled to free medical care and has no insurance cover.</p>
<p>Her three-year legal battle was funded by the charity Shelter.</p>
<p>The UK Border Agency said it was &#8216;disappointed&rsquo;, while Harrow council  &mdash;  which lost the case and has to give a home to Mrs Ibrahim  &mdash;  said European judges were determining British immigration policy.</p>
<p>Housing chief Barry Macleod-Cullinane said: &#8216;We are very concerned-with this outcome, as it appears to establish a major new legal precedent over benefit claims.</p>
<p>&#8216;It could well prove to be a floodgates judgment in that people who have not yet contributed to this country or who do not have the means to sustain themselves can now seek immediate help from state welfare services.</p>
<p>&#8216;This judgment would seem to make the EU policy of free movement impossible unless one greets new migrants at Heathrow with sizeable welfare handouts.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be fair here.  She was originally in the country LEGALLY.  Her husband abandoned her.  She is a defenseless woman with four innocent children.  Where do you expect her to go?  And how is she supposed to get there?  She has been in the UK for over 7 years - which no doubt means her youngest child is a British citizen.  Do you propose breaking the family up?  And as for her &#8220;creature comforts&#8221;, I buy my extended family mothers and friends gifts.  Should my siblings or friends have to explain where a certain toy or PC came from?  Isn&rsquo;t that awfully intrusive?<br>

		<p>&#8220;Mrs Ibrahim fled war-torn Somalia to Ethiopia with her family when she was 15. She married Mohamed Yusuf in Ethiopia before the pair moved to Denmark where he holds citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now how did Mohamed Yusuf get Danish citizenship? And here we go again, that round-about route from Africa to Europe. I suppose that the Ethiopian government wouldn&rsquo;t give them a free residence. So then, I&rsquo;m guessing that they divorced, since the article says that she was &#8220;once married to a Danish citizen.&#8221; So from Denmark, she ends up in the UK demanding housing because her ex-husband worked there for a short time. I just don&rsquo;t see how any EU member nation can afford to function under this kind of convoluted legislation, because if the Somali vagabond in this article is getting away with it, you know that thousands of others are trying the same thing.         </p>

<p>This statement sounds like something out of Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels! What rubbish! And what will happen if the host member state refuses to give Ibrahim a home? Will they get kicked out of the European Union? If I were British, I&rsquo;d say &#8220;good riddance!&#8221;</p>

		<p>And these are the sorts of people the liberal politicians keep telling us that developed, white-majority nations need in order to ensure their future economic prosperity? That woman is in England for no other reason than to leach off the system. It almost makes me wish for a white-minority England, because when that happens, there will be a dearth of responsible taxpayers to fund this lazy woman&rsquo;s lifestyle.</p>

		<p>Istvan, I assume that you are playing the devil&rsquo;s advocate, but this is what I would say if you were serious. This woman was LEGALLY in the UK because those who established immigration laws in the EU never anticipated this kind of abuse. Just because an action is legal doesn&rsquo;t make it right or fair, especially considering that her lifestyle hinges on the contributions of taxpayers who need such benefits themselves, but are not necessarily receiving them. That is why laws are changed. This woman found a loophole and is milking the system. I guarantee that if this woman had been a Christian from an Eastern EU nation, she would never have been in the UK for 7 years receiving such benefits. If her husband abondoned her, that&rsquo;s her problem, and even more so, her husband&rsquo;s problem. The EU does not exist for the purpose of handling private domestic disputes. I would never propose breaking up their family; I would propose sending them all back to their nation of origin. Who decided that any nation has the responsibilty to care for any others than their own citizens? Even if that were the case, is there not a nation closer to Somalia that should take responsibilty for its continental bretheren? Furthermore, anyone who is getting a &#8220;free ride&#8221; is accountable for any riches they accrue. Certainly if you lend someone in need £100, and see them driving around in a Jaguar days later, you will question why they needed the loan in the first place.  </p>

<p>- Fairness is one of the reasons we as Europeans and of European extraction will one day be extinct: we demand fairness while the enemy fights dirty. The fact that she is in legally is inconsequential. </p>
<p>&#8220;And how is she supposed to get there? She has been in the UK for over 7 years - which no doubt means her youngest child is a British citizen. Do you propose breaking the family up?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Break the family up, or send them all packing. Let it be an example to others currently siphoning the lifeblood of our current and ancestral homelands.</p>
<p>&#8220;And as for her &ldquo;creature comforts&rdquo;, I buy my extended family mothers and friends gifts. Should my siblings or friends have to explain where a certain toy or PC came from? Isn&rsquo;t that awfully intrusive?&#8221;</p>
<p>- We may as well start saying that the Ethiopian parking lot attendant isn&rsquo;t a bad guy so how can we judge all of the Ethiopians etc, etc. The fact is that she has no right to be in Europe. The problem is we as whites still crave fair play while the enemy could care less. Intrusiveness as it pertains to the likes of Mme Ibrahim should be the norm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing and betting the greater number of BRITISH citizens don&rsquo;t wven know WTH is going on in situations like this. We have the same problems here in the U.S. though low profile since it is only us &#8220;racissssss&#8221; that pay any attention to it.</p>

		<p>And the irony is that Britain is facing a fiscal meltdown - with massive cuts being demanded in public spending in the near future.<br>
 The fantasy and folly of the leftists and others that Britain is somehow a land of infinite bounty that can accomodate all the third world&rsquo;s riff-raff and detritus will be sorely tested as a hard scrabble fight for limited state resources begins.</p>

		<p>The former husband was a &#8220;Danish&#8221; citizen.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered about this sort of thing.  I have met Asians who call themselves British because they were born there.  Arabs in France sometimes call themselves &#8220;French.&#8221;  But if I move to China and even somehow get citizenship, no one would ever look at me and say, &#8220;He&rsquo;s Chinese.&#8221;  Even if my kids were born there, to a white mother, no one in the world would say my kids are Chinese.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, just about anybody can be called American or Chilean or Canadian if they move there.  Some countries were formed by ethnic or racial groups and others were republics formed more by ideas.  </p>
<p>When you talk about the racial states, how can a person who is not from that race or ethnic group ever claim it?  When will Arabs in Sweden start to call themselves Swedish?  I suspect some already are, but that seems so incongruous, so out of place to do.  This puzzles me. </p>

		<p>Danish immigration policy is probably the best in Europe. If a Danish citizen of Somali ancestry marries a Somali woman, the Danish authorities would say that the couple is more connected to Somalia than to any other country, and that is where they should live. No doubt that is why they moved to the UK rather than to Denmark. <br>
Wonder how her husband ever got citizenship in Denmark anyway  &mdash;  not at all easy to get!<br>

		<p>In the US military, servicemen&rsquo;s families often live in family housing.  When the active duty soldier is KIA or died while  in service, the dependents have 30 days OR LESS to vacate the family housing and leave the post.  It&rsquo;s not of concern to the military where they go, but they MUST GO.  WHY is it we can do that to our citizens who are risking their lives serving in our military, but we CANNOT do the same to legal and illegal immigrants who do nothing but live off welfare????????  If this woman&rsquo;s husband divorced her and left the country, then SHE should be compelled to likewise LEAVE.<br>
Where she goes is not our concern.  Britain is determined to bankrupt itself into chaos and oblivion.  The US appears likewise determined, just slower to go about it.  The reason for both countries is the same - Marxists in power whether they be called the Labor Party or the Democratic/Republican party.  </p>

		<p>Her youngest must have been conceived after her husband &#8216;deserted&rsquo; her or perhaps he&rsquo;s now back in England, different name perhaps, and he could just be still living clandestinely with his wife. There was no mention of a divorce. Her legal fees were funded by &#8216;Shelter&rsquo;, a charity founded to help homeless British citizens but no doubt hijacked to assist muslim immigrants as have so many other similar institutions. Our &#8216;government&rsquo; has had at least five years to sort the matter out and send her back to Denmark but why should they bother when they are still importing pakistani family members to join their &#8216;clan&rsquo; here. I note she is not about to move into a council house so it must be one of those large houses privately rented for her and paid for by the local taxpayers. It would be interesting to discover who owns the house but, in the past, such properties have been owned by the same nationality as the tenant. The government must treat these somali immigrant cases very seriously but can&rsquo;t be bothered to do anything really meaningful about genuine White British citizens held to ransom after being abducted in international waters by somali pirates although they have the naval wherewithal to do so, after all, piracy is an international crime. </p>

		<p>Yes, Lets be fair, very fair.<br>
1, Most readers of this site will have gone to work, paid their taxes and brought up their own children.<br>
2,It is therefore quite fair to ask why this mother should expect a free ride on the British welfare system.<br>
3, A fair solution: <br>
(i) If you can&rsquo;t identify the father of the children, you don&rsquo;t receive a welfare benefit.Simple as that.<br>
(ii) The father has his pay or welfare docked to pay for HIS children. <br>
(iii) As soon as the children are old enough to go into day care the the mother is required to go to work on a &#8220;work for the dole/retraining program&#8221; She can start with scrubbing lavatories and work her way upwards depending on her ability.</p>
