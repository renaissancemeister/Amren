			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Jennings, Dallas Morning News, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The lawyer for a man accused of stabbing a 67-year-old woman to death during her morning walk sought to win leniency for his client this afternoon by acknowledging the man&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Paul Johnson told a Dallas County jury in his closing argument that Theron Lacey, 28, did stab Dottie Reiter.</p>
<p>But, he said, Lacey didn&rsquo;t mean to kill the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m willing to say, &#8216;Yes, this man did it,&rsquo; &#8221; Johnson said, &#8220;but I&rsquo;m not willing to say he did it with the intent to kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jurors were deliberating Lacey&rsquo;s fate late this afternoon.</p>
<p>Reiter, a recent retiree, was killed in broad daylight on the morning of Oct. 28, 2008, as she walked near her Cedar Hill home.</p>
<p>Investigators said the motive was robbery. Her purse and cellphone were taken.</p>
<p>Lacey, who has a record of violent criminal behavior, is on trial for capital murder in her death. His girlfriend and other prosecution witnesses testified that he admitted stabbing Reiter.</p>
<p>If found guilty of capital murder, he would face an automatic sentence of life in prison. That&rsquo;s because the Dallas County district attorney&rsquo;s office chose not to seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>However, if found guilty of a lesser charge of murder, as his lawyer advocated, his sentence could range from 15 years to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really capital murder?&#8221; Johnson asked the jury. &#8220;I submit to you it is not. It is murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutor Kate Pfeifle dismissed the notion that Lacey did not intend to kill his victim, whom he stabbed twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stabbed her with such force that it went through her jacket, her sweatshirt, her T-shirt, her bra, her skin, her bone, her lung,&#8221; Pfeifle told the jury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he took the knife out and did it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnson did not call any witnesses on Lacey&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>But in his closing argument, he recalled testimony from Lacey&rsquo;s girlfriend, LaShaunda Johnson. She said Lacey told her that when he left Reiter, the woman was sitting up on a curb, holding her back. The lawyer suggested that if Lacey had wanted the woman dead, he wouldn&rsquo;t have left her upright and conscious.</p>
<p>LaShaunda Johnson, testifying for the state, told jurors that Lacey confessed to her. She testified that he claimed he killed Reiter when she resisted as he robbed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said the first time he stabbed her was because he was scared, and the second time was because he wanted her to feel his pain,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>She added: &#8220;I was in shock because it was hard to believe he could do something like that. Then I was scared. He said I looked at him like he was some kind of monster.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>When Pfeifle, the prosecutor, asked if Lacey showed any remorse, LaShaunda Johnson replied: &#8220;He said if it made me feel better, I could just think she was prejudiced.&#8221; She testified that according to her boyfriend, Reiter probably didn&rsquo;t like black people, &#8220;and her family probably owned slaves.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>She said that when she saw Lacey on the day of the slaying, he had blood on his sleeve. He told her it came from a cut on her daughter&rsquo;s foot, she testified, but she saw no such cut.</p>
<p>The girlfriend, who was facing other charges of credit card abuse and evidence tampering, acknowledged lying about the killing when initially questioned by police.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s telling the truth now, she said, because &#8220;it was just time. It was the right thing to do. This wasn&rsquo;t going to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, however, that she still loves Lacey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see all the good in him even though he&rsquo;s done so much wrong. And I think love is unconditional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lacey was convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery in November 2009. He was sentenced to 75 years in prison on one of those convictions, and 30 years on the other. He also has a conviction for aggravated assault in 1999, which resulted in an eight-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Matthew Bonner, an acquaintance, said Lacey told him he had killed Reiter. Bonner said he encouraged Lacey to turn himself in.</p>
<p>And Jatavius Bivins, a jail inmate incarcerated at the same time as Lacey, said he recalled that the person in the cell next to him admitted committing the crime. Prosecutors said jail paperwork showed Lacey was that adjacent inmate. But defense attorneys pointed out Bivins never saw the person who was talking and could not identify him in court.</p>
<p>After the jury left the courtroom in mid-afternoon to begin deliberating, Lacey made an obscene gesture at Pfeifle, the prosecutor claimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t do that to me,&#8221; she snapped at him.</p>

		<p>Liberals sometimes question right and wrong (and we might say get them backwards). But this man simply wanted the woman to &#8216;feel his pain&rsquo;. Perhaps we should be a bit more open minded, and respect this individual and his own code of morality. Perhaps it would be alright then if he be allowed to feel Ms Reiter&rsquo;s pain?</p>

		<p>Mulatto Eric Holder will probably send the feds to Dallas and investigate this case for hate crime violations.  Blacks can&rsquo;t commit crimes against whites if black were only &#8220;acting out by kepp&rsquo;n it real&#8221;  because of frustration over &#8220;accumulated and fostered prejudice&#8221; by whites who all secretly long for the good old days of Jim Crow segregation.</p>

		<p>Did they not seek the death penalty, because this genius would have been declared too stupid to suffer capital punishment, because of his low I.Q.?  He certainly merits the death penalty.</p>
<p>The leftist radicals tell us I.Q. doesn&rsquo;t matter, because it doesn&rsquo;t accurately measure intelligence, but they jump on it in defense of a dim-witted black if they want to say he&rsquo;s too stupid to suffer the death penalty.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Is it really capital murder?&rdquo; Johnson asked the jury. &ldquo;I submit to you it is not. It is murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incredible.  Here we have the spectacle of the accused admitting to the crime of murder, but quibbling over what KIND of murder it was. This is the nit-picking and hair-splitting nonsense, searching for infinitessimal technicalities, that our so-called &#8220;justice system&#8221; has come to. We must be the laughing stock of the world.  In former times, they would have just strung him up and been done with it. Now we spend millions on assuring that a murderer (who&rsquo;s not even denying it) has every possible benefit of the doubt.</p>

		<p> So Lacy stabbed her twice so she could &#8220;feel his pain,&#8221; she was &#8220;probably prejudiced,&#8221; and her family &#8220;probably owned slaves&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve heard some poor excuses for horrible behavior before, but that has to take the cake. I guess two presumptions about a person&rsquo;s character entitle one to stab them to death.</p>
<p> And why, with his previous record and the brutality of the attack, did the district attorney choose not to seek the death penalty? In TEXAS, of all places, where there are more executions, year in and year out, than in any other state? </p>

		<p>Go and read the story now.  The &#8220;she probably owned slaves&#8221; part is gone.  In fact, unless one really read between the lines you wouldn&rsquo;t know that the victim in this &#8220;random&#8221; killing was white at all, which I imagine was the point.  Suppressing black on white violence is just what the media does, and they do it quite well.</p>

		<p>And where do you think this guy got the idea that Whites deserve to be punished?  Could it have been from the constant 24/7 propaganda in our culture about how oppressed Blacks are and about how they are being held back by White racism?  <br>
Textbooks and teachers continue to pound the idea of &ldquo;racism.&rdquo;<br>
Movies and TV shows continue to show the horrors of slavery and racism.<br>
Politicians and news casters rant against racism or manage to insert it into the story somehow.  For example, I once read a newspaper article about a new park the city had built, and the reporter led off with, &ldquo;A legacy of past racism was eliminated today with the opening of the new baseball field on Beech St.&rdquo;  Nearly half of the article was a long list of supposed nasty things that whites had done to blacks 50 to 200 years ago.  The story was about a new park, but the reporter turned it into a rant against Whites.</p>
<p>Why did that innocent woman have to die a horrible and untimely death?  Because the people who write the textbooks, newspaper articles, TV shows and movies want to maintain hate.  They know what they are doing and they do it on purpose.  They are as much to blame for the poor woman&rsquo;s murder as the manipulated fool who plunged the knife in.<br>

		<p>#8 Skip - it sounds to me as though he may have been tried on the burglary charges associated with this crime in Nov 2009. I believe capital offenses are tried separately - at least in Texas. </p>
<p>The part of this story that gets me is the rude gesture Lacey made to the prosecutor during deliberations. A very similar case happened in Austin yesterday with a black defendant cursing the victims family and the judge - just a day after he promised the jury that he could change his ways. It really seems an emboldened disposition has taken to these people these days. They have absolutely no decency nor any respect.</p>
<p>In both these cases - these murderers had served brief sentences, only to return to the streets and commit higher crimes. I really wonder if the fear of returning to prison is any deterrent? </p>

		<p>He pretty much just voiced what many, probably most, blacks feel deep down inside towards Whites. Try to imagine Jewish guys going around stabbing elderly Germanic women because of the holocaust. That actually happened WITHIN LIVING MEMORY. Shows you the mentality of blacks.</p>

ANYTIME YOU PRODUCE AN EDGED WEAPON OF ANY SORT OF A FIREARM YOU ARE SAYING TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT: &#8220;I INTEND TO KILL YOU!!&#8221;. Intent is defined by the law and not by your mental state. Merely producing the edged weapon [or a firearm] is a demonstrative of lethal intent, again, whether you intend to or not, realize it or not!!</p>

		<p>So a woman is murdered because someone who may or may not have been related to her may or may not have owned slaves 200 years ago? By this logic Lacey&rsquo;s whole family should be in hiding. Because we know for darn sure that they&rsquo;re related to a murderer. And that&rsquo;s a heck of a lot worse than slavery.</p>

		<p>  I remember watching a show on C-span, probably &#8221; American Perspectives,&#8221; it was about Southern historian Mary Chestnut . And this black lady from Chicago called in berating the host about slavery etc and stating that non-southern blacks were going to move back into the south and basically dispossess southern whites of everything they owned . Farfetched ? Not nowadays . As whites become the minority nationwide in the near future you can look for institutionalized persecution against whites with white liberals leading the charge . It&rsquo;s not a question of if reparations will have to be made but when . And if you are unfortunate enough to have had ancestors who were somehow involved in the slavery thing, you&rsquo;ll be lucky if you do not wind up in prison .</p>

		<p>So Lacy stabbed her twice so she could &ldquo;feel his pain,&rdquo; she was &ldquo;probably prejudiced,&rdquo; and her family &ldquo;probably owned slaves&rdquo;.  This sounds like he was the one with prejudice and hatred toward the victim, yet no &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; was registered by authorities?  What does it have to take to have a murder such as this constitute a hate crime?  I urge all readers to contact SPLC and urge they &#8216;investigate&rsquo; this blatant hate crime.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&rsquo;t this guy get the death penalty?&#8221;  Sounds like the inevitably impending Texas death row lawsuits over preponderance of minorities guilty of such offences might have served as a deterrant.  Had the felon been white, however, prosecutors would gleefully tried to get a death penalty conviction so they could &#8216;balance&rsquo; racially their numbers.  Might be ANOTHER need for SPLC to &#8216;investigate&rsquo; the violation of civil rights for the victim&rsquo;s family here, eh?  Don&rsquo;t hold your breadth.</p>

		<p>Whites who wear blackface and leave nooses under a tree are guilty of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, or at least the left think they should be. Blacks kill whites, and the media downplay or ignore race or portray the killer as a victim.</p>

		<p>Whites once again being whimps and cowering down to blacks.  What happened to the good ole&rsquo; days where blacks were even too scared to look a white person in the eye?  They knew when to speak and when not to.  I hate to say that, but at least in the days before the 60s, blacks weren&rsquo;t as violent and both races didn&rsquo;t have any of the problems we have today.  </p>

		<p>In the days prior to the passage of civil rights whites knew how to keep blacks in line and the percentage of black on white crime was a minuscule fraction of what it is today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for whites to reclaim their dominate place in American culture once again by repealing civil rights, limiting immigration, deporting illegals and purging this nation of communists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for political correctness to be recognized for the insidious social censorship it is and the days of being cowed into silence under threat of losing ones job by speaking freely must end.            <br>

		<p>The prep infers he the victim because he claims &#8220;&hellip; he was scared&#8221;.  Of what?  He had the knife, the physical prowess over a women, and the intent to rob yet she is a runner clearly without criminal intent or a weapon.  </p>
<p>&#8220;When Pfeifle, the prosecutor, asked if Lacey showed any remorse, LaShaunda Johnson replied: &#8216;He said if it made me feel better, I could just think she was prejudiced.&rsquo; She testified that according to her boyfriend, Reiter probably didn&rsquo;t like black people, &#8216;and her family probably owned slaves.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Ahem isn&rsquo;t that stereotyping along racial lines?  How about the victim, had the she tried to rob and kill Lacey claimed she thought him a common thug from the &#8216;hood and assume Lacy didn&rsquo;t like white people?</p>

No hate crime?<br>
No intent of murder?<br>
Just a scared black man with a knife liberating money.<br>
After all she was White, so she must have been racist and her family must have owned slaves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open season on White people and our government is Ok with this. Time to carry a gun and shoot to kill. I&rsquo;d rather be judged by 11, then carried by 6.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine the scene?  </p>
<p>&ldquo;He stabbed her with such force that it went through her jacket, her sweatshirt, her T-shirt, her bra, her skin, her bone, her lung,&rdquo; Pfeifle told the jury<br>
  <br>
and after stabbing her again</p>
<p>She said Lacey told her that when he left Reiter, the woman was sitting up on a curb, holding her back.</p>
<p>Sitting on a curb on the verge of going into shock and doing what would be instinctive to a person wounded as badly as she was. Sitting still and trying to conserve blood by not increasing her heartrate as her body attempts to constrict blood vessels to conserve blood.</p>
<p>Keeping that scene in mind we get to meditate on these things </p>
<p>Defense attorney Paul Johnson told a Dallas County jury in his closing argument that Theron Lacey, 28, did stab Dottie Reiter.</p>
<p>But, he said, Lacey didn&rsquo;t mean to kill the woman.</p>
<p>Liar number one is Paul Johnson defense attorney</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to say, &lsquo;Yes, this man did it,&rsquo; &rdquo; Johnson said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not willing to say he did it with the intent to kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other liars are the &#8220;investigators</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigators said the motive was robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The politically correct DA&rsquo;s office<br>
who should have sought the death penalty</p>
<p>&#8220;If found guilty of capital murder, he would face an automatic sentence of life in prison. That&rsquo;s because the Dallas County district attorney&rsquo;s office chose not to seek the death penalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>A system rigged against whites and of course no one do or say much about it.</p>

<p>Is Paul Johnson black?  I&rsquo;d be willing to bet on it.<br>
And the DA &#8220;chose not to seek the death penalty&#8221;.   Why not? </p>
<p>How many of the investigators and in the DA&rsquo;s office are black? <br>
I think that explains it all. The system is rigged against us, even while we are still nominally the  &#8220;majority&#8221;.  Whites cannot get justice in those parts of the USA that are already under black influence or black control.<br>

		<p>. I really wonder if the fear of returning to prison is any deterrent? </p>
<p>Dying breed, no! it is not a deterrent. In fact, having worked in the prison system in the past, inmates that were about to be released often said things such as &#8220;have my apartment cleaned, I&rsquo;ll be back&#8221; I then saw most of them come back after other crime sprees of varying degrees of ruthlessness. I knew a 23 year old (black) armed robber in the S.C. corrections system, a minimum security system, who was in for his 7th armed robbery, each of which carries a mandatory 7 year sentence in S.C. unless of course, you&rsquo;re black. He had committed these armed robberies while out on parole FOR armed robbery, this is not heresay, I knew the inmate for more than a year.</p>
