<h1>North High School Is Chinese Cultural Center</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Olson, Press-Enterprise (Riverside, California), February 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every Saturday, Riverside&rsquo;s John W. North High School is transformed into the Inland area&rsquo;s Chinese cultural center.</p>
<p>In the morning, about 80 students sit in eight classrooms to learn the Mandarin Chinese language and then shift to other rooms for lessons in subjects such as calligraphy, kung fu and brush drawing.</p>
<p>An hour after they leave, another weekly Chinese school takes over with a similar combination of language and culture classes. In other rooms at North, mothers of many of the students learn and practice traditional Chinese singing and dance, and fathers play basketball in the gymnasium.</p>
<p>Yuzhen Liu teaches her sixth-grade Chinese language class on Saturday at North High School in Riverside. The school serves as a cultural center, offering music, dance, sports and more to those of Chinese ancestry.</p>
<p>In a region such as the Inland area, where the small Chinese population is widely dispersed, North is a cultural and linguistic oasis where immigrants share memories of the old country and children learn their parents&rsquo; language and traditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Chinese school can act as a kind of collecting point for all Chinese-speaking people,&#8221; teacher Jinwu Ma said on a recent Saturday afternoon as he walked across the North campus, the sounds of Mandarin coming from the classrooms. &#8220;People have a need to relate to people similar to them. If we did not have this, it would be hard to get together.&#8221;</p>
<p>SMALL PERCENTAGE</p>
<p>Ma, 47, has lived for the past five years in Lake Elsinore, where there are relatively few other Chinese immigrants. Less than 1 percent of the population of Riverside and San Bernardino counties  &mdash;  about 34,000 people  &mdash;  is of Chinese ancestry, according to 2008 U.S. Census estimates, compared with nearly 4 percent in Los Angeles County and 3 percent statewide.</p>
<p>Weiping Yang, a software developer from Redlands, spends almost his entire workday speaking English. Yang, 50, likes playing basketball with fellow immigrants each Saturday while his son studies Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can shout in Chinese: &#8216;Pass the ball to me,&rsquo; &#8221; Yang said, his face covered in sweat as he took a short break from a game.</p>
<p>Yang, Ma and other immigrants said North is the only place they know of in the Riverside-San Bernardino area with such an array of Chinese language and cultural activities. There is also a Chinese school in Chino Hills, on the western edge of San Bernardino County.</p>
<p>Some Inland Chinese immigrants attended the occasional dances, banquets and other events held by the Inland Chinese Association. But the group has been dormant during the past two years or so, said Dee Guan, 59, a board member of the Inland Riverside Chinese School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CULTURAL CONNECTION</p>
<p>The preference that many children of immigrants have for English is a key reason why the two schools exist. Jia Mei&rsquo;s 12-year-old son Kevin is learning Chinese, even though Mei and her husband speak Chinese to him in their Corona home.</p>

		<p>There is no economic,cultural and demographic justification for the expansion of the chinese population in America through LEGAL IMMIGRATION.</p>
<p>If and when NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS become a radcial minority within the borders of AMERICAN, you can be certain of this:the asians-along with other post-1965 nonwhites-will control &#8220;US&#8221; immigration policy. And it will be a national origins immigration that will completly exclude European peoples.</p>
<p>If you think asians in the US are going to subscribe to the golden rule of ethics you are delusional.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental issue. An asian &#8220;Amerian&#8221; with the last name Gupta-student body president of UCSD-is the ring leader of the anti-White protests on the UCD campus. This is what happens when the White population in an area shrinks to minority status. Now scale this up tp the country as a whole. It is a dangerous situation for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>

		<p>The Asians really are concerned about links to their cultural heritage.  Latinos just sing and dance whenever they get together, never bothering to improve their often atrocious Spanish, but Asians take their cultural arts seriously.  There will come a time when the few whites here and there will be like the people mentioned in this article.  Already, the one defining white conscious cultural event that you find organized all over the country is the Renaissance/Medieval fair.  This is the only type of gathering I know of in which whites flock to in large numbers to celebrate culture.</p>

		<p>All non-white groups have their own nations, or even continents, to which they may return. For some reason, they tend to pass on the chance.</p>

		<p>Can I use the public school on Saturdays to teach European culture to the European-descended population? After all the public schools aren&rsquo;t much doing it these days.</p>
<p>Sadly, I also doubt that many people would show up. The Chinese are going to clean our clocks.</p>
<p><b>you can be certain of this:the asians-along with other post-1965 nonwhites-will control &ldquo;US&rdquo; immigration policy</b></p>
<p>They already do. It&rsquo;s called &#8220;priorities.&#8221; Lots of white Americans are concerned about over-immigration and about becoming strangers in our own land, but most of them place it near the bottom of their concerns, and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t determine their vote. But Asians and Latinos, along with numerous monied business interests, have made it abundantly clear that they will withhold their money and votes from any politician that tries to enforce the immigration laws or reduce immigration, especially &#8220;family reunification.&#8221; Thus a tiny minority already effectively has a veto over any changes to immigration law.</p>
<p><b>An Asian &ldquo;American&rdquo; with the last name Gupta - student body president of UCSD - is the ring leader of the anti-White protests</b></p>
<p>I looked him up. He campaigned against the university&rsquo;s restrictions on &#8220;free speech&#8221; - then shut off funds to the UCSD tv station when they used a racial epithet. He&rsquo;s American-born, yet lives in the International House - presumably with lots of other people who are ethnically Indian, perhaps speaking Hindi or Urdu or whatever. The guy claims to be opposed racism yet prefers to live amongst his own. Nice.</p>

		<p>They spy on our atomic scientists, cram full our technical schools, marry with each other by bringing in wives from China that has a surplus of women. Their children have no tats and rap skills. They do not rat on each other. They wait for the day they will take revenge on all who speak English for the Opium War of 1845. 165 years ago to them is like two minutes and five seconds to us since they have been around for over 65 centuries. The opium came from India which is why they hate all things sub-continent.The British brought it in on their ships of the line and stole part of their country Hong Kong; which is why they hate the British. We backed the British and other imperialistic thugs in the Boxer rebellion which is why they hate us. Mao`s own son was shot down and killed in a Mig-15 along with about 1.5 million of them in the Korean war and we made their traditional blood enemies the Vietnamese into a regional economic super power which is why they really hate us.</p>

That goes for immigrants from Africa, all of Asia, and the Indian sub-continent as well. They may be legal immigrants, but that doesn&rsquo;t make them desirable. </p>

		<p>Look, know matter if they speak English, now matter how modern or western they become on the outside, they are still Chinese!  The Japanese certainly are a first world, first rate nation yet they are still distinctly Japanese.  And so the Chinese will remain, regardless of where they settle.  And that is OK.  I just don&rsquo;t want them taking over my nation and culture.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t white people learn to appreciate their distinctly American culture, traditions and language.  We have a 400 plus year history, several uniquely American dialects of English and many fine traditions.  Our solid British roots.  The contributions of major immigrant groups like the Germans, Italians and Irish, not to mention numerically smaller groups like the Scandinavians, Slavs, Greeks and Hungarians.  </p>
<p>Our contributions to the world are the greatest known to man.  Art.  Science.  Exploration.  And the whole concept of CIVIL RIGHTS!  Yes Rev Al, the notion of civil rights, equality and fair play are uniquely American.  We invented the notion that &ldquo;any boy could grow up to be president!  We have more to celebrate and be proud of than any other peoples on earth!<br>

<p>  Regrettably, Istvan any attempt to do so is swiftly branded as &#8220;racism&#8221; by our enemies.  Instead, all we have are media orchestrated orgies of guilt over historical events that happened before the ancestors of the majority of whites even arrived in the United States.</p>

		<p>The damage to the fabric of our nation and White culture is now so great, the only way to correct the problem would be by massive bloodshed&hellip; i.e., that Civil War II anticipated or mentioned in previous posts by many readers. In short, unless enough Americans develop the spine to take unpleasant but necessary action, we White Americans are doomed to eventually become a minority in our own country.</p>

		<p>Chinese-ness is not limited by geographic residence in the motherland. </p>
<p>The Chinese have been migrating into Malaysia since the 15th century. Instead of mingling with the population in a &#8216;multicultural melting pot&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve retained their Chineseness. They have a separate school system and language and for all intents are living as an offshore province of China.</p>
<p>Now that Chinese nationalism has replaced communism, the Chinese are reaching out to each other around the globe, giving renewal to their arts and customs, even as they take what&rsquo;s useful from other cultures.</p>
<p>Beware they increase their numbers here.</p>
