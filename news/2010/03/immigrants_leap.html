<h1>Immigrants Leapfrog Natives Into Local Government</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Tyler, Radio Netherlands, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dozens of immigrant candidates pushed aside colleagues with greater seniority to get elected to Dutch local councils in last week&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>They did this by getting more personal votes than others higher on their party&rsquo;s list of candidates.</p>
<p>This is not so unusual in the Netherlands, particularly in local elections, says Meindert Fennema, Professor of Political Theory at the University of Amsterdam. He explains the workings of the immigrant lobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a well-known phenomenon that well-organised immigrants vote for their candidate, man or woman, and in that way, these candidates fairly easily get onto the city council. After all, it doesn&rsquo;t take that many personal votes.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>Widespread</strong></p>
<p>But it appears to have happened on a larger scale this year than ever before. (National results are not yet available.) In every major city, and many medium-sized cities in the provinces, candidates of immigrant background have jumped ahead of their colleagues.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, Ahmed Marcouch, born in Morocco and raised here in the Netherlands, got nearly as many personal votes as the leader of his party (even though he was number 29 on the party list). In Utrecht, two immigrant candidates got elected this way, in Rotterdam one. (See below for a partial list of cities where immigrants got elected through personal votes.)</p>
<p><strong>Unrepresentative</strong></p>
<p>In perhaps the most extreme example, in the southern city of Helmond, the Labour Party saw four of its candidates pushed aside. The party got enough votes for six seats on the city council. But the numbers three to six on the list of candidates, all of whom are native Dutch, were passed by. Four candidates of immigrant background further down the list drew enough personal votes to get onto the council.</p>
<p>This has led to some consternation in the Labour Party in Helmond. This is a medium-sized city of some 88,000 inhabitants, about twenty percent of whom are of non-western immigrant background. But according to the election results, two-thirds of the Labour Party caucus on the city council would be immigrants. And all male. That is not very representative.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one of those candidates of immigrant background has decided not to take his seat, in favour of a female candidate higher on the list.</p>
<p>But the issue remains: is it good to have so many immigrants chosen by personal votes?</p>
<p><strong>Renewal</strong></p>
<p>Addressing this question in the wake of the previous municipal elections back in 2006, Labour Party leader Wouter Bos expressed his concern that too much expertise was being lost. The party compiles its list of candidates in part based on experience, and those further down the list were replacing more experienced candidates.</p>
<p>Professor Fennema says this is inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;This happens with every renewal. When the aristocrats had to give up their place in politics, they said the same thing. Every time a new group participates in the political process, some expertise is lost.&#8221; </p>
<p>Dutch politics is currently going through such a renewal. Politicians of immigrant background can be found at every level, from city council to mayor to the Dutch cabinet. Ertan Isik, of the Labour Party in Eindhoven, was elected to the council with personal votes. Of Turkish parentage, Mr Isik has lived in the Netherlands for 33 years now. He is tired of the whole discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to be regarded as an immigrant. No, I&rsquo;m just a citizen with a certain background and certain capabilities. That&rsquo;s how I want to be seen, and not just because of my background, with whatever prejeduces that brings. I find that inappropriate, and, as a matter of fact, insulting.&#8221; </p>
<p>But the discussion continues, not the least because party bosses appear to have underestimated the strength of the immigrant vote in these municipal elections. One way or another, immigrants are finding their way in Dutch political life.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen similar things happen in Canada.</p>
<p>Muslims are aggressively interested in holding office.  They play democracy like a game: they get their people concentrated in one area, and then they out-vote their opposition.  For them it&rsquo;s ballot jihad.</p>
<p>Once they takeover leadership, the white party faithful line up to support their new master.</p>

		<p>You see, people of a certain background always try to get &#8216;their own&rsquo; into positions that will benefit their group as a whole.  This is human nature and shows we are tribal at heart.</p>
<p>Here in the big urban area where I live, the polyglot of racial groups have their own private fiefdoms and they are constantly trying to expand at the expense of others.</p>
<p>The Jews ran the school system from top to bottom for the last 50 years, now their influence is waning as other groups carve out niches.  Haitians control various departments of city gov&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p>Indians are cementing control in the medical field.  Latinos are swiftly (very much so) taking over city gov&rsquo;t at a very efficient pace.  Black influence is ebbing.  The only whites are the old guys at the top.  A local Indian doctor was recently fired from the county medical administration because it was found out that over the last ten years he has hired virtually only Indian doctors!</p>
<p>The list is endless, but at the end of the day, social cohesion disappears.  Any crisis can bring the whole unstable house down.  The only multi-ethnic societies that have ever survived in human history are those that are held together by force by a ruling dominant group.  When the leading group gets diluted, the society always crumbles.  Netherlands, remember these times.</p>

		<p>I feel sorry for the Netherlands, I really do. As if they&rsquo;re not over-crowded enough, and yet here they are with enough immigrants to usurp established politicians. At least they have a very large and successful nationalist political party, the Party for Freedom I think its called (Partei vor Freiheit??). Also good news for Dutch nationalism, the Flemish nationalist, secessionist party (can&rsquo;t remember the name) of Belgium, is I believe that country&rsquo;s largest political party (however, due to the many parties in Belgium, their total percentage of the vote is not near the majority), despite having been previously disbanded by the courts. </p>

		<p>I feel sorry for the Netherlands, I really do</p>
<p>Feel sorry for us in the U.S. The same thing is happening to us as shown by the CHC and CBC when there is no CWC. Blacks or hispanic/illegals get into office and they will of course vote themselves into office as predicted by SKIP the psychic and others:) The Dutch are in for a harder time at the moment because their foreigners are mostly Pakistani muslims.</p>

		<p>Non-Whites blatantly and explicitly vote for their own ethnic genetic interest - that&rsquo;s the name of the game and 3 billion years of evolution tells us that this is the right strategy.<br>
  On the other hand elite Whites (see the story on the political persecution of the BNP by the British state), use their overwhelming political power to destroy their own ethnic genetic interest - just how perverse and &#8216;unnatural&rsquo; can you possibly get?, Seriously speaking, according to the immutable laws of nature does such an ethnicity actually deserve to exist?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m personally delighted the Marxists in the Labour Party are starting to get a little of their own back. The white leftists will be the first to be replaced by the Muslims. I can hardly think of anything more deserved.</p>
<p>I hope the foolish Dutch who voted for the Labour Party now realize they were not voting for people to represent themselves. As far as I can tell, Geert Wilders and the PVV are the only hope for the Netherlands at the present.</p>
<p>#3 Anon.: The name of the Dutch party is Partij voor de Vrijheid. The name of the Flemish party is Vlaams Belang (formerly Vlaams Blok).</p>

		<p>An interesting fact about the Turks in Western Europe is that many of them support the Grey Wolves, a nationalist and pan-Turkish group which has been linked to at least one poltical killing - of a Turkish leftist - in Germany.</p>
<p>The Grey Wolves are said to advise their supporters in Western Europe to join leftist parties in their host countries, NOT on the grounds of ideological affinity but simply because they&rsquo;re the easiest for groups of immigrants to join - as in the U.K. and Canada - and the softest touch when candidates are selected.</p>
<p>Holland is an interesting country:</p>

		<p>The Netherlands is a very small, very densely crowded country. Why it would need ANY immigrants, even IDEAL ones, is completely impossible for me to understand.</p>

		<p>The Dutch are among the most open-minded tolerant people in the world. For them to recognize the threat of unassimilable non-European immigrants is indeed hope for the rest of us in the West.</p>

Reason for taking in all those Morrocans and Turks was that the &#8220;lazy so and so&rsquo;s&#8221; during the economic boom years in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to manual labor and imported the &#8220;flunkies&#8221; from the forementioned lands. And then they got stuck with the blacks from the Surinam and Dutch Carribean holdings after they got their independence.&#8221; Be Dutch, move to Holland and go on the &#8220;Dole&#8221; And enhance your income with some common crime. They deserve what they got. An emigrant!!  </p>

<p>An &#8220;open&#8221; mind is often not much different then an empty one and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; is often not much removed from the vice of indifference.</p>

		<p>This shift in the political arena is taking place in the US, both legally and illegally.  For instance, in Baltimore, Maryland it is legal for non citizens to vote in local elections.  God knows if the authorities are looking the other way and allowing them to vote in statewide and national elections.  On the other hand, voter fraud has occured in states like California where at least one conservative congressman lost reelection due to illegals voting.  </p>
<p>I think Europe has sunk too far to win back their homeland.  Perhaps a very &#8220;stern&#8221; government may have time to deport the problems or at least end the dole that allows them to thrive.  Of course a government of this type will be called fascist and the self-destructive socialist whites will not have any of it.  The world will be an even more treacherous place in the next 50 years than it was in the last 100. </p>
