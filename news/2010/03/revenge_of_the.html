<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Millions of white men who voted for Barack Obama are walking away from the Democratic Party, and it appears increasingly likely that they&rsquo;ll take the election in November with them. Their departure could well lead to a GOP landslide on a scale not seen since 1994.</p>
<p>For more than three decades before the 2008 election, no Democratic president had won a majority of the electorate. In part, that was because of low support  &mdash;  never more than 38%  &mdash;  among white male voters. Things changed with Obama, who not only won a majority of all people voting but also pulled in 41% of white male voters. Suddenly, there were millions more white men voting the Democratic ticket.</p>
<p>{snip} It was only after the economic collapse that Obama&rsquo;s white male support climbed above the 38% ceiling. It was also at that point that Obama first sustained a clear majority among all registered voters, according to the Gallup tracking poll.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pollsters regularly ask voters whether they would rather see a Democrat or Republican win their district. By February, support for Democrats among white people (male and female) was three points lower than in February 1994, the year of the last Republican landslide.</p>
<p>Today, among whites, only 35% of men and 43% of women say they will back Democrats in the fall election. Women&rsquo;s preferences have remained steady since July 2009. But over that same period, white men&rsquo;s support for a Democratic Congress has fallen eight points, according to Gallup.</p>
<p>White men have moved away from Obama as well. The same proportion of white women approve of him  &mdash;  46%, according to Gallup  &mdash;  as voted for him in 2008. But only 38% of white men approve of the president, which means that millions of white men who voted for Obama have now lost faith in him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that the flight of white males from the Democratic Party has come as the government has assumed a bigger role, including in banking and healthcare. Among whites, 71% of men and 56% of women favor a smaller government with fewer services over a larger government with more services, according to ABC/Washington Post polling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This recession remains disproportionately a &#8220;he-cession.&#8221; Men account for at least 7 of 10 workers who lost jobs, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Blue-collar men have suffered 57% of the job losses. And blue-collar white men, who make up only 11% of the workforce, constitute 36% of those who have lost jobs. In total, nearly half of the recession&rsquo;s casualties are white men, having held 46% of all jobs lost.</p>
<p>In 1994, liberals tried to explain their thinning ranks by casting aspersions on the white men who were fleeing, and the media took up the cry. The term &#8220;angry white male&#8221; or &#8220;angry white men&#8221; was mentioned 37 times in English-language news media contained in the Nexis database between 1980 and the 1994 election. In the following year, the phrases appear 2,306 times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Think about the average working man. He has already witnessed financial bailouts for the rich folks above him. Now he sees a healthcare bailout for the poor folks below him. Big government represents lots of costs and little gain. Meanwhile, like many women, these men are simply trying to push ahead without being pushed under. Some of them once believed in Obama. Now they feel forgotten.</p>

<p>Are they counting hispanics as white again?  I have a cousin who is a retired Democrat Congressman and he put the number at more like 18%.</p>

		<p> Excellent points from Mr. Kuhn! Of course, what he fails to mention is that in the 2008 election, Obama got only 43 percent of all White votes. It was blacks, Hispanics and other non-Whites who put him over the top. You&rsquo;ll almost never hear that in the mainstream media, either.</p>
<p> The MSM loves to refer to &#8220;irrational anger,&#8221; always among Whites or conservatives. Who has the right to brand it &#8220;irrational?&#8221; And why is &#8220;anger&#8221; not a legitimate reason to be against a wrong-headed course of government policy? The MSM always seemed to feel that those who were, not merely angry at, but who HATED, George W. Bush, were fully justified</p>

		<p>Whenever a long-time buddy of mine,(I&rsquo;ve known him since childhood and we&rsquo;ve always kept in contact)comes over to my place, we usually have a few beers and get out the chessboard while discussing politics, a bad habit we both have.(talking politics) More than twenty years ago I used to say to him that any, ANY, white male who votes for the Democrat Party is voting for his disempowerment. He always chided me about this, for years, but has recently become a &#8220;true believer&#8221;. Now his attitude is that he must have been brainwashed when he looked back, so clear was it that the Democrat Party is anti-white. Not anti-whit male, anti-white. Now,to anticipate some of the posters here who would point out the negatives of the Republican Party on this same issue, don&rsquo;t bother. I agree totally. It&rsquo;s just that the Democrats are so far ahead in their utter disdain of white males. Please, it&rsquo;s a part of their official platform.</p>

		<p>IT is a rare MSM story that does NOT trash white men; I sense fear. Now about white women, what is their motive in hanging on to the Obama frenzy? Is it just a desire for the nanny-state to tend them and advance them beyond just desserts, or is there more to it? Is the enemy in our midst?</p>

		<p>It makes no difference if they move to the GOP.  Tweedle dee and tweedle dumb.  </p>
<p>Will the GOP dismantle the affirmative action edifice? Nope.  Will they secure our borders? Nope.  Will they hand over trillions to banks and corporations? Yep.</p>
<p>As long as the GOP continues to push men like McCain and Bush, they wont generate much enthusiasm.  </p>

		<p>Most of the &#8220;shovel ready&#8221; jobs promised in the stimulus package were actually diverted to make-work social work largely dominated by women, and minority women in particular.  The reason is that feminist groups were outraged at all the construction-oriented &#8220;shovel ready&#8221; work that would have been directed to white men (mostly), and former Labor Secretary Robert Riech actually said on TV that he didn&rsquo;t want white men getting jobs created by stimulus money.  Of course, as the article rightly points out (but underestimates in percentage terms IMHO), white men have sustained the biggest job losses in this recession.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Obama got even 41% of white men voters is that he made enough vacuous promises in enough rust belt states that he was going to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.  The average person walked away from such TV ads thinking that Obama would actually end job outsourcing, but I was not so easily fooled   &mdash;   It was nothing more than phony David Axelrod triangulation to fool enough white men in enough important states.  Hint:  The labor in Asia is a lot cheaper than the increased taxes.  Not only has this not happened, but it&rsquo;s worse than that:  President Obama owns GM for all intents and purposes, and about a month ago, a woman from suburban Detroit called Rush&rsquo;s show saying that her job at GM-owned GMAC was about to be outsourced to India.  This is one outsourcing that Obama can stop with a stroke of an ink pen, but he won&rsquo;t.  So much for no more outsourcing.  (Outsourcing is only half the problem.  What they can&rsquo;t move to India or China, they move India and China here with various visa programs to work the jobs on American soil for far lower wages and hardly any benefits.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s not a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the Democrat and Republican parties!&#8221; - Alabama Gov. George Wallace, 1968.</p>
<p>What was true then is even more true now.  As I like to ask my White Republican friends: &#8220;During the six years the Republicans basically had a lock on this government (2001-2006) what did they do that was basically any different from what the Dems had been doing previously?&#8221;</p>
<p>Did we have a balanced budget?  Did we see a rollback on so-called &#8220;civil rights&#8221; (i.e. anti-White) laws?  Were our borders fortified?  Were ANY appreciable number of illegals deported?  Name one major program put in place by a Democratic administration the Republicans took down.</p>
<p>In the final analysis: a Republican victory will change nothing!  Obama-care is here to stay.  The U.S. will still have no borders.  Nothing will change and everything will continue to worsen.  Why?  As Michael Corleone so succinctly put it to Senator Pat Geary:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re part of the same corruption.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They should never have voted for Obama in the first place.  The fact that they did indicates that they are not the White men and women who are going to fight for their rights AS White people any time soon.  The fact that they are drifting away is positive but it is far from an uprising.<br>

		<p>The fact that any white men born before 1970 would have even entertained voting for Obama speaks volumes as to how brainwashed our people really are.  They&rsquo;ve lost their country and many of them don&rsquo;t even realize it.  Whether its the minorities or the traitorous whites who now call the shots, it&rsquo;s gone.  They&rsquo;ll never get it back unless the revolution we&rsquo;re all hoping for actually materializes.  The point of critical mass is here and there are far too many white fools to count.  Although Republicans may win many seats in November, the fact of the matter is they, too, have done nothing to keep this country majority white.  In 45 years, we&rsquo;ve lost just about everything the world over.<br>

It is not totally true that REpublicans did nothing when they were the majority.  Remember that it was the Republicans in the House who began the revolt against illegal immigration amnesty under the courageous leadership of Tom Tancredo.  The problem with the Republicans is that many of them are two-faced politicians but there are a core of them that are pretty solid on American values.  You have to remember that the Democrats have ruled the roost since the 1930s.  They controlled the House for forty years.  The media are liberal and on the side of the Democrats giving people a very distorted view of reality.  Because of the dominance of the Democratic party and the anti-Republican media, it is not surprising that the Republicans became wimpy and apologetic.  McCain and Bush are two examples of Republicans who have been turned against their own race because of all of this pyschological warfare.</p>
<p>We have no hope in the Democrat party but there is some hope with the Republicans.  The anti-white strategy of the Democrats is begining to backfire on them.  Now is the time to vote for selective candidates who can win and that means the Republican party.  We have to be shrewd as the politicians are shrewd.  We have to realize that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter whether a politician votes our way because he really believes as we do or because he is just a conniving politician who sees which way the political winds are blowing.  The Republicans are increasingly going to realize that it is the white vote that will get them elected.  They will adjust their positions accordingly especially when they see John McCain go down in November. </p>

<p>George Wallace will be redeemed by history.  He saw through it all.  Too bad that after he was shot, he began to seek &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; . Forgiveness for what?! For telling the truth?</p>
<p>The trauma he suffered from his wounds had an effect on his mental capacity.<br>
 <br>
Neither party has the best interests of Euro- Americans at heart. Democrats have the &#8220;minority&#8221; (translate Black &amp; the majority of Hispanics) vote sewed up. Republicans continue to suck up to these groups in their nauseatingly wimpy attempts to create &#8220;the big tent&#8221; under which the &#8220;camel&#8221; has no desire to stick his nose.</p>
<p>The only solution is the formation of a Caucasian political movement. It needs to address the protection of the interests of all European/ Euro peoples from North America, through Europe and Euro- Oceania and the remaining Caucasians in  Zimbabwe and SA. and the perpetuation of the race and culture. The two &#8220;mainstream&#8221; parties have betrayed and deserted us. </p>
<p>Such a movement could start right here at AMREN.</p>

		<p>AvgDude, I wish you were right, but I personally know dozens of middle class, hard working, moderate- to- conservative white men who voted for Obama. In the months before the election, I was amazed at the number of them who unequivocally said they were going to vote for him. I did not and I do not understand what made them think that he was actually going to make things better. Disgust with Bush and aversion to McCain  are insufficient as plausible explanations. To a one, these were men who had the ability to do research and see that Obama was an empty suit socialist with no qualifications whatsoever for the position, even by recent standards. In my opinion, it&rsquo;s the most blatant example of misplaced trust in a political figure since 1933. If anyone posting here has a theory about the phenomenon, I&rsquo;d like to hear it. I&rsquo;m not being facetious.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 16: &#8220;The only solution is the formation of a Caucasian political movement. </p>
<p>Such a movement could start right here at AMREN.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have followed this website for about 18 months now and was set to attend my first AmRen conference before Imm and his goons wreaked their havoc.  I have never sensed such a heightened degree of urgency as that which I see in the comments sections of the last few weeks.  Something must be done.  </p>
<p>We need to somehow set up a base camp in a heavily White area (I suggest Idaho, North Dakota, Wyoming, etc) and get going.  I currently reside in Northern Virginia in a D.C. suburb that, while very White, would not offer the kind of protection of environment we would need at the outset.  I am in my mid 20&rsquo;s, unemployed (thus not tied down) and willing and able to move somewhere and dedicate all my spare time to the cause.  </p>
<p>There have been tens of thousands of words I have seen typed on this website that aim to inspire ourselves into starting something concrete..something real.  All we have to show for it thus far is a canceled conference and a continuing website.  If Mr. Taylor had set up shop in the Northwest/Midwest, I feel our situation would be much different right now, perhaps much stronger on a person-to-person level.  Unfortunately, he resides about 10 minutes from me, in striking distance of left-infested New World Order D.C.  This is not the breeding ground for our success.</p>
<p>I say we get some funds together, get a lot of people from this website, and head on out to Idaho and get started.  I will grant you that a lot of what I am typing here is a lot easier typed than done, but this has to start somewhere.  It has to start now.  Does anybody want to meet up and discuss in person (or via e-mail if we must) about getting going?? Even if it&rsquo;s just a small group, it would be something.  Are there any takers or will this thread just go by the wayside like so many before it, without having spurred anyone to tangible laying of the groundwork for a group??  I would appreciate responses..</p>

		<p>Our problem is that whatever evils the Democrats try to shove down our throats, and are opposed by the Republicans, are then accepted and endorsed by the Republicans no more than 10 years later.  A Republican is just a time delayed Democrat.  The Department of Education was created by the Carter administration as a payoff to the teacher&rsquo;s unions.  Reagan promised to abolish it.  (He didn&rsquo;t.)  George W. Bush doubled it&rsquo;s size, and pushed the No Child Left Behind Act.  I guarantee that in 10 years or less every elected Republican will regard the recently passed health care government takeover as a sacred pact with the American people, never to be reduced or abolished.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has repeatedly shown that it will only give us Bush clones.  The most decent man in the Party, Ron Paul, is ignored and despised by its leadership.  And not even Ron Paul will cut legal immigration.</p>
<p>Working class whites are especially in a bind.  They were abandoned by the Democrats about 45 years ago.  (Younger people may be shocked to hear this, but back in the days of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations Democrats cared about the white working class.  At about the same time the Labour Party cared about the British white working class   &mdash;   and look what became of them.)  Republicans never cared about the working class, and still don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The reason is that feminist groups were outraged at all the construction-oriented &ldquo;shovel ready�? work that would have been directed to white men (mostly), and former Labor Secretary Robert Riech actually said on TV <b>that he didn&rsquo;t want white men getting jobs created by stimulus money.&#8221; </b>  &mdash;  - QD<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Amazing that we have come to this! Who would have guessed? Can you imagine the same words being spoken about blacks?  Never!  The lofty-sounding package that white voters were peddled back in the 60&rsquo;s assured us that we were aiming for a color-blind and &#8220;just&#8221; society in which no one would be judged by the <b>color of their skin </b> [white men], but solely by the content of their character.  Rubbish!  </p>
<p>Now, after thinking that we were eliminating racial discrimination and injustice, it hasn&rsquo;t worked out that way at all!  What  we presently have is blatant racial discrimination, with no denial   &mdash;  - except it is against <i>us!</i> And it is rationalized away under the specious pretense that it is &#8220;justice&#8221; and fairness. </p>
<p>It seems that NONE of the phony, idealistic programs that were presented to us back then (ie immigration reform) have turned out to be as they were promised.  We were lied to, but now the damage is done. It&rsquo;s a fait accompli.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It makes no difference if they move to the GOP. Tweedle dee and tweedle dumb.</p>
<p>Will the GOP dismantle the affirmative action edifice? Nope. Will they secure our borders? Nope. Will they hand over trillions to banks and corporations? Yep.</p>
<p>As long as the GOP continues to push men like McCain and Bush, they wont generate much enthusiasm.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gotta question guys like this. It drives me crazy. It sounds like the too-ignorant-to-see-his-own-liberalism Glenn Beck. &#8220;Oh, I hope both parties burst into flames!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was anyone who spouts this kind of trope paying any kind of attention during the G.W. Bush attempt at illegal alien amnesty? The Republicans in Congress were, almost to a man (loons like McCain and Lindsey Graham-nesty excepted) virulently opposed to amnesty. What was their reward? Bush hatred derangement syndrome infected white &#8220;independents&#8221; (synonym for purblind) who promptly tossed them out of office in 2006.</p>
<p>What was the effect of this ingenious move by white &#8220;both parties are the same&#8221; voters? We have the left in near total control of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>What is the result of this brilliant &#8220;independent&#8221; vote? Obama care.(Against which, Republicans offered unanimous opposition.)</p>
<p>To now be followed (Democrats/liberals being by the Obama care victory now enormously emboldened)by a total amnesty of all illegal aliens. Lets not even talk about cap and trade.</p>
<p>What will be the result of the legalization of the Mexican invasion? Permanent disenfranchisement of Republicans/conservatives from political power, i.e. the disenfranchisement and ultimate overthrow of Americans, by which I mean America&rsquo;s founding, white people.http://tinyurl.com/y988ljp</p>
<p>Of course in 2006, the left, and liberals who pretend conservatism (such as Barone or Medved)could crow that Republican rejection of amnesty got them voted out. Lies and da..ed lies. The truth is that whites who hate amnesty, enraged at Bush, swallowing the &#8220;both parties are the same&#8221; Cool Aid.</p>
<p>Millions of whites took revenge on Bush by shooting themselves in the foot. That is to say, they voted out the &#8220;evil&#8221; &#8220;no difference&#8221; Republicans (who were on their side) and elected the people (Democrats) who seek permanent political power by permanent disenfranchisement (through amnesty) of white people.</p>
<p>Oh, and as to this comment &#8220;Will they hand over trillions to banks and corporations? Yep.&#8221;, in the words of Trickey Dick Nixon &#8220;Let me say this about that&#8221;.:</p>
<p>All the so called &#8220;bailouts&#8221; and the entire sub-prime mortgage crisis that caused them, can be lain almost entirely at the Democrats feet. Even Bush and McCain, bad as they are, tried repeatedly to stop/regulate Fannie and Freddy (the Dems little money machine)and the sub prime mortgage looming disaster.</p>
<p>It was the likes of Carter and Clinton, Barney Frank and Maxine Waters, in the name of racial equality in mortgage lending, who created this disaster.</p>
<p>The error of Bush, McCain and the Stupid Party in this affair was allowing the leftist coup of the TARP bailouts, falling for the Marxist &#8220;crisis&#8221; scam and power grab.</p>
<p>But instead of reforming the good guys, and recapturing the Republican party for true conservatism (which always leans pro white when it is real, as under Reagan), lets destroy ourselves by irrational protest votes or suicidal third party spasms.</p>
<p>Such moves, such &#8220;thinking&#8221; will create, for ourselves and our kindred, such a hopeful, bright future. </p>

		<p>The only thing that will prevent an Obama re-election is a bout of heavy inflation.   The history of the last fifty years is a history of the Left committing cultural genocide through the media and schools and physical genocide through immigration, and the Republican Party and establishment Conservatism have collaborated for profits all along.  The &#8220;change&#8221; Obama represents is the change from a white country to a non-white one, that&rsquo;s the real battle, and since the Repub/Cons refuse to acknowledge that the battle even exists they are unlikely to win it.   The Republican&rsquo;s might be able to nominate and even win with a white male once or twice more but it is essentially all over for conservatism and the Republican party as anything but a brand name.   They&rsquo;ll have to move ever more to the left, particularly on racial matters, if they want to win.   A lot of white, little conservatives who helped enforce so-called anti-racism that is just a mask for hatred of whites (why, oh why must we have hyphenated Americans! sniff.) are going to be lamenting in the future when the real change comes.  Here is an excellent editorial on Obama from a UK paper:</p>

Who cares?!!!    I don&rsquo;t know about your argument. I&rsquo;m not sure.  But other posters are saying it&rsquo;s better to jump into the abyss and get it over with, then start anew.

<p>Fact is, both parties are two sides of the same coin and neither one serves our interest (nor deserves our suppoort).  They are both lethal to us, being committed to our demise and replacement.   At best, the Repubs just prolong the agony a little longer.  Is that really better?</p>

<p>See I disagree with your dismissal of the culpability of Bush 43 in the subprime debacle.  Whatever useless &#8220;checks&#8221; he said he wanted on the industry, they were small beans compared to the damage he caused.  AMAF, I blame him as much as I blame Clinton/Carter/Kennedy and their CRA brain-dead legislation.  Bush himself moaned about how down payments were &#8220;discriminatory.&#8221;  (Well, duh.  They discriminate against those with bad credit ratings.  They discriminate against those who have no intention of making the mortgage payments.)  So we had to create a lot of  little or no down payment mortgages to satisfy black and Hispanic whining.   And look at what trouble it created.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t elaborate too much, b/c the explanation is long and accountanty, but the reasons there used to be a 20% standard for down payments on houses were several:  (1) You started the loan with 20% skin in the game.  This was your incentive to make the payments if you could.  If you don&rsquo;t start the loan with any equity in the house, then you lose nothing if you don&rsquo;t make as much as one payment, and very little if you don&rsquo;t make any after having made a few.  (2)  It was insurance for the bank or lender.  If you failed to make as much as one payment, and the bank had to foreclose, it would break even if it could sell the house for 80% of their loan to you.  That means that even in a falling real estate market, the bank would either make a small profit, break even, or lose very little.  If you didn&rsquo;t have to make a down payment, then the bank has to sell for 100% or close to 100% of principal, and they&rsquo;re guaranteed to lose in times of falling real estate values like these (and it was inevitable based on the economics of subprime affirmative action mortgages, as an aside).  (3)  A 20% down payment requirement acted as a buffer to keep real estate from going too high, and therefore, going back down too fast, and therefore, the boom-and-bust cycle.  If you had to make a 20% down payment, this means that you had to buy a house wherein 28% (*) of your gross income could fit into a payment (principal + interest + tax escrow + insurance escrow) of a loan that&rsquo;s 80% of the house&rsquo;s selling price.  This was a brake to prevent housing from shooting sky high as it did in the late 90s and into the next decade, as is the natural consequence of having no down payment.  And it kept housing affordable for working middle class native born white Americans.  </p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;m glad housing values are plummeting.  They should plummet even more.  Because they never should have gotten that high to begin with.  IMHO, it was unconscionable for the average selling price in the San Fernando Valley of L.A. to increase from 150G in 1997 to 600G in 2007.  Can you afford a $600G mortgage, even in a low interest rate climate?  Housing that expensive is just not conducive to the Sailerian concept of affordable family formation for the average white person.</p>
<p>(*) - That was another thing that was eviscerated during the height of the subprime circus.  Used to be that 28% of gross income was the max payment the bank would let you make, so that you can have some of your own after tax money for other expenses.  That ratio was effectively 60% or more at the height of the insanity   &mdash;   Some people don&rsquo;t net 60% of their gross income thanks to income taxation in certain brackets.  So the bank was letting you make a payment for more money in a month than you actually took home.<br>
And here, I wanted to avoid long and accountanty explanations.</p>

		<p>Im gay and I live in CA. I would NEVER vote for Obama or any Democrat. Liberals and open borders have destroyed this state, as you know. I don&rsquo;t like it anymore than you do. I don&rsquo;t know too many gays, but I  did run across some Hollywood liberals during the election. About half of them were voting for McCain. Some long time white liberals, even gay, are very afraid of a black president. I used to occasionally speak with a gay South African, another former liberal. Both of his parents were brutally murdered in the new South Africa by blacks. He learned reality the hard way. </p>
<p>I mind my own business and work hard to survive. I don&rsquo;t bother anyone, and I don&rsquo;t hate anyone. Like you, I&rsquo;m horrified to see what has happened to this country. I&rsquo;m not so scared for myself, but for my family, and the future of our children. </p>

<p>There&rsquo;s precious little that you write to quibble with. Your description of the reasons for a 20% down-payment standard are outstanding. One has to have a complete lack of common sense to disagree with them.</p>
<p>Yeah, Bush and McCain are racial liberals. The fact remains that they tried 13 times to reign in the financial shenanigans of &#8220;capitalizing&#8221; or &#8220;securitizing&#8221; (or whatever the h..l)the bad paper into packages of mixed bad and good mortgages. The banks had this shoved down their throats, not by Republicans, but by the creeps I name, et al.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Republicans lack backbone when the left uses phony discrimination complaints to curry votes (e.g. your report of Bush saying &#8220;down payments were &#8216;discriminatory.&rsquo;&#8221;) But it is the left, in and through their instrument, the Democratic Party, that promotes this racial treason, seeking to pander their way into permanent and overwhelming power.</p>
<p>Power in this nation comes from winning elections. The left understands this. Why don&rsquo;t we? What do some gentlemen want? To dream of ideologically pure third parties that divide pro white votes and deliver leftist victories? </p>
<p>No. Only the hard work of making it publicly acceptable to have white interests considered, to be again viewed as respectable,  will change this situation.</p>
<p>The capture of conservatism, and its party, the Republican party, to represent white people&rsquo;s legitimate interests remains the only rational path to political and legislative change.  </p>

<p>Maybe they did, but it was like smoking three packs of cigarettes a day to give yourself lung cancer, then putting a band-aid on your chest as a cure.  </p>
<p>You are very right to notice all the shenanigans, slights of hands and hat dances that took place around the buying and selling the accounts receivable of these subprime mortgages.  This extends to a debate between the regular here on AR, JewAmongYou, and myself, from a few months ago.  The debate was about &#8220;private sector&#8221; culpability for the subprime fallout; J.A.Y.&rsquo;s position was that it was almost entirely government&rsquo;s fault, mine was that government and the relevant &#8220;private&#8221; industry deserve equal shares of the blame.</p>
<p>Think about this:  Yours truly is nobody in particular who lives nowhere in general and does nothing remarkable.  Yet, I&rsquo;ve figured all of this out, and I knew what was coming before it came, just through pure common sense and the clever application of the relatively few credit-hours of economics, finance and business law I have under my belt.  Yet, all these failed former investment houses and banks had untold dozens or hundreds of economists, combined they all have more degrees than a thermometer.  Yet, not a one of them could see the folly in betting on perpetually rising residential real estate values as the insurance hedge on trading the A/Rs of affirmative action mortgages drawn on the basis of flimsy paperwork and documentation, or rather, drawn with the most intense of social concern, and trading those A/Rs as if they were better than gold.  Not a one of the whiz-kid economists who worked for, e.g. Lehman Brothers, had the sense to tell the suits up on the top floor that selling insurance policies (credit default swaps) to big name national banks on $720,000 mortgages given to Hispanic strawberry-picker stoop laborers in California&rsquo;s Central Valley who *claimed* $14,000 a year of income (without any requirement to prove that meager unworthy-of-a-jumbo-loan income   &mdash;   You can bet some of those $720Gs were remitted to Mexico*) could possibly go wrong.  </p>
<p>Yes, government (and the political left as practiced mostly by Democrats and partially by neo-con Republicans)) made the banks draw these mortgages, but all these banks and investment houses have/had lobbyists up the yin yang that they could deploy in a moment&rsquo;s notice.  They should have, for they should have recognized the threat to their own well being.  Like the dodo bird, they couldn&rsquo;t see it and couldn&rsquo;t act upon it, and it should be no surprise why they went extinct, and on top of that, we had no business propping up some of the firms that would have otherwise failed.   </p>
<p>Another problem was that the wall between banking and investment was taken down in 1999, that being Glass-Stegall.  Because it was taken down, many big name banks and big name investment houses merged, either by co-equal mergers or by unequal cannibalism.  This made the investment firms&rsquo; problems the banks&rsquo; problems (and the banks had plenty of their own).  And, as you know, while an investment firm is the money of willing investors, a bank is grandma&rsquo;s social security checks.  Why do you think the FDIC is almost out of money to insure deposits?  Sam Francis, during his first issue as Editor of the <i>Citizens Informer</i>, the house organ of the Council of Conservative Citizens, approved and ran a front page article about the repeal of Glass-Stegall (this was in late &#8216;99), which rightly predicted (and underpredicted) the consequences of doing so.  I know a lot of people yanked Sam&rsquo;s chain about running such a &#8220;non-racial&#8221; article, but as it turns out, it was very much a racial issue, because of the racial angle of the subprime mortgage fallout, dominoes could fall so easily from investment houses to banks and vice-versa precisely b/c G-S removed the wall.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -</p>
<p>* - Western Union made out like bandits during this time period, because of a mysteriously high number and dollar amount of remittances to Latin America.  Yet, they &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t afford&#8221; to keep their native born white American call center and accounting staff employees in St. Louis, nor their relatively well-paid Spanish-speaking call center in Dallas, such that all those jobs were outsourced to Costa Rica in 2008.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.  The Republicans know that they are an overwhelmingly white party.  Do the Republican politicians ever conclude from that that they should vote in the interests of white people?  Do they ever conclude that they should cut off the torrent of immigration so that their natural constituency doesn&rsquo;t become a minority?  Of course not.  Instead they look at the demographic handwriting on the wall and, realizing that whites are soon to be a minority, do everything they can to pander to blacks and Hispanics, including favoring illegal alien amnesty and affirmative action.  Like Dick Armey they cling to the delusion that they will somehow turn a majority of Hispanics and blacks into Republicans.  What will actually happen is that the Republican Party will become identical to the Bill Clinton wing of the Democratic Party, while the Democratic Party will become outright Marxist in all but name.<br>

		<p>[quote]Our problem is that whatever evils the Democrats try to shove down our throats, and are opposed by the Republicans, are then accepted and endorsed by the Republicans no more than 10 years later. A Republican is just a time delayed Democrat. The Department of Education was created by the Carter administration as a payoff to the teacher&rsquo;s unions. Reagan promised to abolish it. (He didn&rsquo;t.) George W. Bush doubled it&rsquo;s size, and pushed the No Child Left Behind Act. I guarantee that in 10 years or less every elected Republican will regard the recently passed health care government takeover as a sacred pact with the American people, never to be reduced or abolished.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has repeatedly shown that it will only give us Bush clones. The most decent man in the Party, Ron Paul, is ignored and despised by its leadership. And not even Ron Paul will cut legal immigration.</p>
<p>Working class whites are especially in a bind. They were abandoned by the Democrats about 45 years ago. (Younger people may be shocked to hear this, but back in the days of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations Democrats cared about the white working class. At about the same time the Labour Party cared about the British white working class  &mdash;  and look what became of them.) Republicans never cared about the working class, and still don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with this except fo the last sentence.  The Republican elite may not care about the &#8220;working&#8221; class, but they don&rsquo;t support massive redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the dysfunctional lower class, and that&rsquo;s very important to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip; An oblique step away from the abyss is better than a running leap into it. &hellip;�?</p>
<p>Not if going into the &lsquo;abyss&rsquo; is necessary to solve the problem. The United States is like an old, severely ill man of mixed race lying on a hospital bed.  There is no way that his condition can be improved by patching up a few things here and there and then getting him &lsquo;back on his way&rsquo; (this is the conservative approach, which avoids any sort of fundamental break with the system). The only solution is to &lsquo;pull the plug,&rsquo; so to speak, in order to put him out of his misery, so that something new can be built in his place. The US will NEVER be able to solve its internal racial problems within the framework of the current political process. It can&rsquo;t happen. </p>
<p>This much is certain: Regardless of whatever &#8216;indirect&rsquo; positive consequences follow from certain conservative Republican policies, it is a simple FACT that Republicans will NEVER explicitly advocate for the interests of European-derived people in the US. </p>
<p>There is no &#8216;back door&rsquo; solution to America&rsquo;s problems, no gimcrack scheme which will solve everything while still allowing the vast majority of Americans to continue going about their daily routines of consuming, eating, and boob-tube watching. There will be no short-cut, no slyly worded Constitutional amendment, and no &#8216;secretly racist&rsquo; political candidate who suddently &#8216;turns the tables&rsquo; after he gets elected. America is far, FAR more sick than people here at Amren realize&hellip;.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;&hellip; The Republican party is the only one presently in any position to break the Democrat party&rsquo;s grip on power over all facets of power in federal government. If not done immediately, there may never be another chance, as they rush to swell the ranks of voters with immigrants all too eager to support and participate in the smothering of white Americans, and theft of our entire nation. &hellip;�?</p>
<p>Lol, I suggest you read more about what the &lsquo;Republican Party&rsquo; really stands for. They take their orders from the same gang who instructs and controls the Democrats. The Republican Party would never &lsquo;break Democratic power,&rsquo; precisely because a Republican administration would merely be a continuation of Democratic power in another form. The only difference between Democrats and Republicans is how they spell the names of their groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; Sure, the Republican party needs some shaping up, but that is within the scope of possibility, especially with whites turning to it precisely because of their realization of the hostility to them which is so fundamental to the left. &hellip;�?<br>
Oh, it needs much more than just a little &lsquo;shaping up,&rsquo; it needs to be completely destroyed. </p>
<p>And you are only deluding yourself if you think that &lsquo;whites&rsquo; are flocking to the Republican Party out of concern for their &lsquo;racial survival&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s not how the System has taught them to think. They are concerned purely with economics. Besides, the Republican Party is just as hostile to their interests as the Democratic Party, perhaps even more so, because Republicans cling even more tightly to the structure of the current establishment than Democrats do (liberals are, after all, far more idealistic than conservatives).<br>

<p>There are no good paying jobs anymore that will catapult the working poor Whites and the working class Whites into the middle class as there are also few opportunities for the middle class to move into the upper middle class.  All the bridges have been burned by the elites that allow for upward social mobility and people are angry.  They are forging alliances with minorities to take from the elite the future they&rsquo;ve been robbed of.  Is it any wonder the country is turning socialist?  The elites had better start caring about the lower classes because these angry people are going to take them for everything they can.<br>

Unless there is a vast right wing conspiracy hidden in the far corners of the GOP, ready to spring out and jail every Democrat on a charge of treason when the moment is ripe, there is no hope from the Republicans.  They have gone along on the dispossession of Whites for decades, a set of issues with which they could have crucified the Democrats if they&rsquo;d tried.  Had Reagan or Bush flatly demanded the end of race quotas or non-White immigration, they&rsquo;d have been able to run half the Democrats out of Washington on those issues.  Don&rsquo;t many of us dream of forcing a leftist to explain why they never give up their good job to a deserving Black?  A president can do that, if he chooses to.

<p>Yes, the Republicans aren&rsquo;t keen on redistributionist policies.  (Although they never get rid of the ones we already have.)  But they had no objection to the massive outsourcing of our manufacturing capability, nor do they object to importing an unending stream of H-1b workers to take middle class American jobs.  There are even EB-3(C) visas for <i>unskilled</i> workers, as if we didn&rsquo;t already have millions of undereducated, unskilled, underemployed people right here.  The Republicans are fine with that, anything to keep corporations happy.  Democrats are no better, of course, they take the same positions as the Republicans on these matters.  The white working class still has nowhere to go.<br>

<p>Very well said!  The Republican elite have looked out for their own hides at the expense of everyone else.  They&rsquo;ve survived by selling out others.  Just like the Democrats. They haven&rsquo;t a shred of racial identity or solidarity, and the very hint of it would  fill them with alarm. They are all proudly anti-racist and PC.  To save themselves, they&rsquo;d be happy to stand by and watch you sink while they jump into the last lifeboat. Do raceless people like the   Bushes care about anyone but themselves and their class?  Money and their own immediate  families come first   &mdash;   but not you, white man!</p>
<p>And ditto with the Kennedys,  of course.  Reagans and Bushes, Kennedys and Kerrys,   Clintons and   McCains,  Democrats or Republicans, they&rsquo;re all the same on these issues.  Politics is a rich man&rsquo;s hobby and the Senate is a millionaire&rsquo;s club.  They&rsquo;re all united by money and self-interest.  But not racial interest. They don&rsquo;t identify  with  middle-class American native-born whites, and they would reject the very idea as &#8220;racist&#8221;.  At the suggestion, they&rsquo;d be the first to ostracize us. So why support them?</p>
<p>I am amazed at these die-hard Republicans who continue to bark up the same tree, fruitlessly   &mdash;   always hoping for different results&hellip;the next time.</p>
