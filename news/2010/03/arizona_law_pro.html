			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Goldman, ABC News, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bill empowering police to arrest illegal immigrants and charge them with trespassing for simply being in the state of Arizona, is likely just weeks away from becoming the toughest law of its kind anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Already passed by the state&rsquo;s Senate and currently being reconciled with a similar version in the House, the bill would essentially criminalize the presence of the 460,000 illegal immigrants living in the state.</p>
<p>The measure allows police to detain people on the suspicion that they are illegal immigrants, outlaws citizens from employing day laborers, and makes it illegal for anyone to transport an illegal immigrant, even a family member, anywhere in the state.</p>
<p>The bill&rsquo;s supporters say a local crackdown has become a necessity because the federal government has failed to adequately seal the borders or actively enforce its laws. They blame Arizona&rsquo;s spiraling crime and unemployment rates on its large population of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant rights groups believe the bill, especially the trespassing provision, will further burden the already stretched-thin resources of local law enforcement agencies, result in hassles of U.S. citizens, and encourage cops to arrest and charge people based on racial profiling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce said he &#8220;was not advocating roundups.&#8221; By creating a law that &#8220;eliminates all sanctuary policies,&#8221; illegal immigrants  &mdash;  unable to work, travel or even be present in the state  &mdash;  would ultimately &#8220;leave on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>The senator argues the state law puts teeth in federal laws already on the books, by turning misdemeanors, like employing day laborers, into felonies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[J.D. Hayworth, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate said,] &#8220;Simply stated, we need to give law enforcement officers the tools to do their jobs. Border security is national security and it&rsquo;s time to take handcuffs off law enforcement and put them on criminals who break our laws.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I am so sick of this illegal immigration issue, precisely because of stories like this. EXCUSE ME, but a law against trespassing and entering the U.S. without permission, let alone working and living here is already on the books  &mdash;  IT&rsquo;S CALLED UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION LAW. Why exactly, do we need new laws, although I appreciate the intent? Playing politics with this issue has got to stop, because for those states who continue to do so, the call of CALIFORNIA  &mdash;  bankruptcy,out-of-control crime, arrogant hispanic and other communist reconquistas,are waiting patiently on you.</p>

		<p>I wonder how this trespassing law works if the illegal alien has squirted out a jackpot baby on US soil? There are probably plans in the works for the federal government/LaRaza/SPLC/ADL to sue the state and tie up enforcement of the law in the courts for months.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no lawyer, but surely this will be struck down. A recent federal court ruling (covered here on Amren) asserted that, since immigration enforcement was a federal matter, only the Feds could enforce it. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;A bill empowering police to arrest illegal immigrants and charge them with trespassing for simply being in the state of Arizona, is likely just weeks away from becoming the toughest law of its kind anywhere in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How laughably absurd; that calling what an alien pestilence of racial displacement criminals and marauders do in Arizona or the USA as a whole, &ldquo;trespassing&rdquo; is seen as &ldquo;tough,&rdquo; only shows how abjectly low we have sunk in this country. They are not &ldquo;trespassing,&rdquo; they are invading our country, end of story.</p>
<p>With that in mind, these &ldquo;new&rdquo; measures should: allow police to detain people on the suspicion that they are invaders and execute them on the spot, if proven to be so; outlaw citizens from employing or advocating for them as an act of terrorist treason; and make it illegal for anyone to transport an invader, even a family member, anywhere in the state or out of it into our greater country.</p>
<p>That it does not, is reason enough to grasp my head and shout to Heaven: God Help Us All!</p>

		<p>The two focal points that will break up the US are border control and blue state lack of fiscal responsibility.  The begging bowl will be out soon for using federal funds to pay for the hoards of unfunded state pensions.  I can only imagine how this is going to infuriate states that have relatively good budget discipline.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;toughness&#8221; of the law doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is what Arizona is going to do when (not if) the federal government strikes down that law (as it has done all similar laws).  Will Arizona be the first state to tell the federal courts simply that they do not have that authority.  Will Arizona IGNORE the federal government and simply do what needs to be done?</p>
<p>If the answer to that question is yes, then the dam will burst and every state will routinely ignore the federal government on a whole host of issues from gun regulation to abortion.  The feds will fruitlessly try to retaliate with illegal withdrawel of federal funding on all levels.  But that will do little more than trigger tax revolts (or&hellip;.worse).</p>
<p>The states are mulling over soveriegnty issues but the truth is they have no institutional soveriegnty because the federal government is controlled by shadowy others and the courts are rigged.  Which is OK&hellip;.because the federal government has no real power except the willingness of the states to cooperate.</p>
<p>So stop cooperating.</p>

		<p>My first thoughts are &#8220;what does this mean for the states that border Arizona?&#8221; In the immediate future - the prospects are not good, for the mid to long term &hellip;.. this will be a wonderful thing! </p>
<p>The dominoes must start to fall somewhere and as soon as our lil friends start swarming over &amp; devouring the surrounding states - things will change quite rapidly. </p>
<p>But &hellip;..then again &hellip;. there are already similar laws written and not enforced in any type of cohesion. </p>
<p>Are we as a people this lame and afraid to protect &amp; fight for what is ours? Or are we about to wake up and give both our forefathers and grandchildren something to be proud of?</p>
<p>I do believe the next few months will be very interesting.</p>

		<p>I guarantee that some federal judge will declare this law illegal if it is passed.  He will rule that only the federal government can enforce immigration law, knowing full well that the federal government has no intention of ever enforcing immigration law.  Not while Democrats, neocons, and RINOs rule Washington, D.C.  At the least the state of Arizona had better budget for a full scale assault from the pro-illegal immigration ACLU.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of hearing the whining about racial profiling.  We all know that damn few of the illegals are Swedes.</p>

		<p>While I support tough laws (and the tougher the better) it is the enforcement (or lack thereof) that makes the difference. As others have pointed out, there are already <i>federal</i> laws on the books. The problem is they aren&rsquo;t being vigorously enforced. </p>
<p>The difference here is that this is a state law. And as others have pointed out, the courts have ruled immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. But this isn&rsquo;t immigration enforcement. This is <i>trespassing</i>. And we&rsquo;ll see how this fine distinction holds up in court. If it holds up then we have a way for every state to do an end-run around Uncle Sam&rsquo;s lollygagging.</p>
<p>One last thought, state police once had the authority to arrest illegals. But they were doing too good of a job so congress passed a law saying they couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore. In other words, there is a deliberate attempt by the federal government to not enforce the law. This isn&rsquo;t about something that can&rsquo;t be done. This is a battle between two opposing sides.</p>

<p>One of the things the fed uses for browbeat various states into submission, is the threat of witholding fed highway funds. With tax revenues down and spending up, there is going to be less and less Fed highway funds to withold e.g. no longer a viable threat. States will finally be free to do what they want when those states&rsquo; politicians that have allowed the fed to beat their states down are, in some form or other, removed from office AND any further influence.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s needed here in a mass revolt by the states. If we had a dozen or more states pass laws or referendums allowing illegal aliens be charged with trespassing like Arizona then the ACLU, La Raza, the chamber of Commerce, et al. would get the message that an angry public has had enough with these invadors. I believe if other states in the 1990s had enacted laws prohibiting welfare and schooling for illegals the way California tried with Proposition 187 we might not be in a such a deep hole now. There was talk of duplicating Prop 187 in states like Floria, Illinois, New York and New Jersey but nothing materialized and the now the crisis has spread far beyond the once &#8216;golden&rsquo; California. </p>

		<p>State nullification of federal authority is already well underway.  Montana, Wyoming and Tennessee have each nullified federal firearms laws.  What they need to do now is criminalize any attempt by federal agents to enforce them (by charging them with kidnapping and unlawful detention if they actually arrest someone).  Thirty seven states (at last count) are working on nullifying the Obamacare legislation.</p>

		<p>This was very clever thinking on some one&rsquo;s part. A statute on trespassing is not a State attempt to supersede Federal law, as it is not about immigration. Moreover, it clearly will apply to all State facilities - schools, many hospitals, social welfare agencies - and on a charge so simple and direct that it will be easy to process. I&rsquo;d suggest this is exactly analogous to the measures Juliani put in for &#8216;broken window&rsquo; crimes, which all here probably have already studied. By enabling felons to be picked and efficiently processed on minor charges, you reduce the average number of felons on the street. Since it is certainty, more than any thing else, that has proven to be one of the most effective weapons in the effort to reduce felonies. this should work well. Similarly, I don&rsquo;t know it is as vulnerable to ACLU charges as some are claiming. A state can today exclude from a college campus any one who has no right to be there - and an illegal immigrant has no legal right to be on a state facility.    Many people who would never call INS might very well call a local police officer to enforce a &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; violation. Let&rsquo;s hope the law is given a chance to succeed.</p>

<p>People are so ignorant of history it isn&rsquo;t even funny.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s ignorance or not, 14th Amendment ratified or not, the same meant to give citizenship to illegal&rsquo;s babies or not, the reality of the matter is that illegal alien babies ARE given citizenship. The argument against the 14th Amendment is good, but the powers-that-be don&rsquo;t care; likewise they don&rsquo;t care about the 16th Amendment not being properly ratified, either, because they want and need the money.<br>
