<h1>Civil Rights Complaint Filed Against Dekalb Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Matteucci, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A parent has filed a federal civil rights complaint against the DeKalb County School System, alleging discrimination against black students.</p>
<p>The parent and In My Shoes-The National Parent Education Center filed the complaint Friday with the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complaint is under evaluation to determine if the allegations are appropriate for OCR investigation and resolution,&#8221; said Jim Bradshaw, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges DeKalb&rsquo;s International Baccalaureate program for middle school students, which is for high-achievers, is geared toward white children, Bradshaw told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, the complaint alleges that during the 2009-2010 school year, only one middle school, located in the northern section of the DeKalb County School System, has an IB program,&#8221; Bradshaw said, &#8220;and, that the predominantly non-African-American students who live in that school&rsquo;s attendance area were given first priority to the IB program.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The district offers the international baccalaureate program at only one of its 20 middle schools  &mdash;  Shamrock Middle School, which is the northern end of the county. The complaint argues that the school caters to white students.</p>
<p>Georgia Department of Education enrollment figures for the current school year show that 50 percent of Shamrock Middle&rsquo;s students are black, 21 percent are white, 13 percent are Hispanic and 11 percent are Asian.</p>
<p>Under board policy, DeKalb gives first preference to students who are in Shamrock&rsquo;s attendance zone and then offers the remaining seats to other students through a lottery. Parents of students outside the attendance area must provide their own transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clear cut racial discrimination,&#8221; said Phyllis Austin, founder and CEO of In My Shoes-The National Parent Education Center. &#8220;Because they don&rsquo;t have any programs on south end, they should get equal access. They didn&rsquo;t even put this child in the lottery. They just said you live out of zone and you can&rsquo;t go there.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Perhaps they did want to offer IB on the &#8220;south end.&#8221;  But, because IB is harder than most colleges, and way harder than HBCUs, there weren&rsquo;t enough takers to justify its cost.</p>
<p>There is only one high school in St. Louis City&rsquo;s public district which offers IB.  Though the school is almost evenly divided between blacks and whites, with a small percentage of others, it is the whitest public high school in the city, and the only one where whites in the suburbs want to come into the city to attend, under the city-suburb deseg agreement.  Using this logic, IB should be offered at every other St. Louis City public high school, even though those schools are consistently in the bottom 10% of the state in terms of test scores.</p>

These people never understand the issue.</p>
<p>Being in these advanced programs don&rsquo;t make kids smart. Smart kids are the ones who are admitted to these programs.</p>
<p>Any black or other minority who can meet or exceed the criteria should be admitted.</p>

		<p>The IB program is so tough that if 50% of all black students fail to graduate regular school, 90% will fail the IB program. This is about as discriminatory as refusing to enroll amputees in the football program. Come to think of it, that would  make an excellent test case to show the stupidity of these lawsuits. The law is quite clear, the schools have to make accommodation for the  handicapped, it would be fun to see how they accommodate that.</p>

		<p>Typical gimme gimme whining. If the school is 50% black, the plaintiff will have a hard time demonstrating that anything in the school is catering to whites. I do not doubt the differential in IQ between the races is why there are appreciably more whites in the IB program than blacks, but that is not the issue.   </p>
<p> And for whatever reason, the program is only currently in one school, Austin would prefer to destroy it by court process than to work towards expanding it to other areas of the county. Its a typical mindset, rather than agree to a portion of the pie, she prefers the pie thrown in the dirt so nobody gets any. </p>

		<p>We need to resegregate immediately.  Whites who try to be educated are now harassed and intimidated by afrothugs.</p>
<p>Integration has failed.  Let&rsquo;s just hope that its failures fall most hard on liberal elite whites. Unfortunately, these whites send their kids to majority white private schools where they learn to talk about the joys of Inclusive Tolerance and Multicultural Diversity.</p>
<p>When the Diversities rise up, no amount of &#8220;holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our white privilege&#8221; will save these liberal elite whites from the inevitability of the afrothug voodoo curse on America.</p>
<p>Seeing that horror show play out will indict Greely, Lincoln, Stevens, Myrdal, Eisenhower, and Kerner as the worst of our Race.</p>
<p>Proud Whites will be vindicated and redeemed. Especially Southerners. Every Black on White crime occurring above the Masons and Dixons Line proves all our warnings true. We didn&rsquo;t wish race crime against Whites upon the North, but when it happens, we don&rsquo;t hesitate to say &#8220;told ya so!&#8221;</p>

		<p>These plaintiffs aren&rsquo;t very bright. Don&rsquo;t they realize that programs like IB are the last desperate attempt to keep any white children in urban public schools. Once they are gone so is the whole idea of gentrification. Do black parents really want their offspring to grow up in all black neighbourhoods and go to all black schools? Nuts!</p>

		<p>I was very fortunate to be a part of the IB program during my highschool years. Moreso, I was fortunate to be a part of a curriculum that never gave in to political correctness or affirmative action of any kind.</p>
<p>The highschool I went to was well over 90% black. Not surprisingly, the IB program demographics included them at, as I recall, no more than 10% despite their numbers in the school. Even then, the blacks that were admitted into the program were often ones that BARELY skated by and the great majority were kicked out by senior year.</p>
<p>Insofar as the program itself is concerned, it&rsquo;s VERY challenging and a ton of work. I also noticed very little, if any liberal influence on what was being taught. In Humanities and American Government, I&rsquo;d say we probably spent thirty minutes total learning about &#8220;slavery&#8221; in the US. So little attention being paid to this didn&rsquo;t go over with the few black students very well. Tough. One of my teachers even went out of his way to note how brutal slavery was in other parts of the world at other times compared to how well black slaves were treated here in the US. </p>
<p>Parents: If your child is about to attend highschool, I&rsquo;d advise you to look into the IB program if the school has it available. Odds are, your child will be chosen anyway, but it&rsquo;s always a good idea to seek it out, also. Hopefully, their experience will be as good as mine was. They won&rsquo;t have to worry about a bunch of unruly blacks disrupting class while having to learn at a snail&rsquo;s pace because teachers have to let the slackers catch up.</p>

		<p>Here in NC my three kids have all gone through public schools and taken advantage of Advanced Placement Classes(usually mostly white). Its been our salvation in a 80% black school system. Blacks are welcome if they are smart. These racist blacks suing Atlanta show that some racist blacks want to harrass our achievements at every turn. The black kids steal and bully the white kids in the halls and lunchrooms but Advanced Placement Classes are a safe zone.My son is a popular athelete with both black and white kids, but is often challenged by black kids in the halls. He can&rsquo;t fight them all, or he becomes like them. Families are finding ways to survive and prosper, we are all of European stock at Amren, we&rsquo;ll make it. Many books will be written one day about our Second Reconstruction here in Dixie.</p>

		<p>Sbuffalonative (#2) made a very astute point; many blacks actually believe that if their F student kids were placed into an advanced program the teachers would pour knowledge into their heads and make them turn smart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like Pee Wee Herman thinking he could become Heavyweight champ if only he had Freddy Roach or Emmanuel Steward training him.    </p>

		<p>Lessee, it&rsquo;s been 40 some-odd years since the civil rights legislation went into effect, and the blacks STILL haven&rsquo;t learned that it&rsquo;s ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT that counts, not the color of your skin.  You can bet that the kids in the IB program are Asian and white primarily, because they are the most intelligent kids, and they set a high priority on education.  Blacks and Mexicans are going to have to do the same if they want to be able to compete where intelligence is concerned.  All this whining about blacks not getting their fair share if IB isn&rsquo;t going to make said blacks any smarter or even remotely qualified to participate in that program.</p>

		<p>As others have mentioned here, some blacks believe that, if non-smart black kids are put into programs for smart kids, they will magically become smart!  Some white liberals preach pretty much the same thing, though it&rsquo;s doubtful that any truly believe it.  And then there are the blacks who simply want the same thing whitey has, whether they know what to do with it or not. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry!  Social justice will be served.  They will open the program to the &#8216;underserved&rsquo; and the standards will be lowered to the level of the surrounding poorly performing school classrooms.  Remember, social justice says that the only way to make everyone equal is to lower all standards to the lowest common denominator.  Why can&rsquo;t we all just accept that so that we can have a truly equitable society?  Liberals know what&rsquo;s best for us!  Look at how many perferct societies they&rsquo;ve built around the world!</p>
