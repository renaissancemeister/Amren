			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NBC-DallasFortWorth, March 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge has ruled that a Farmers Branch ordinance banning illegal immigrants from renting apartments is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jane J. Boyle of Dallas ruled Wednesday that the ordinance was an attempt to enforce U.S. immigration laws, something only the federal government can do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ordinance established a licensing system for renters in Farmers Branch. Renters would be required to pay a $5 fee and obtain a residential occupancy license issued by the city&rsquo;s building inspector. Under the system, the building inspector would verify a renter&rsquo;s immigration status with federal officials if the renter did not declare him or herself a citizen or national of the United States. The city would revoke the licenses of people the federal government said were in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Boyle said in her ruling that the measure uses federal immigration classifications in ways that aren&rsquo;t authorized or contemplated by federal law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The judge also said in her ruling that Ordinance 2952 &#8220;directly and substantially&#8221; regulates the residence of immigrants in Farmers Branch, which interferes with the uniform enforcement of federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>The city has for years been trying to enforce bans on landlords renting to illegal immigrants. Federal courts have also struck down other versions of the ordinance.</p>
<p>Mayor Tim O&rsquo;Hare, who supports Ordinance 2952, told The Dallas Morning News that he favors appealing the ruling, but said the City Council would have to vote on that.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the cost of doing nothing?&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the cost of doing nothing, it affects your school districts, it affects your shopping centers.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think such things are starting to become very dangerous to the federal government. For the first time in generations, the states are questioning the legitimacy of the federal government itself (as well they should).  Local authorities attempt to solve serious problems and are told for no good reason at all that it is not allowed by the federal government.  One day, very soon, a majority of the states are going to do what they want (or in many cases, have no choice) to do and are going to say to the federal authorities, &#8220;what are you going to do about it&#8221;.</p>
<p>It has already crossed that line with certain issues in a few states (for example, firearms regulation).</p>
<p>The answer to that question is&hellip;..nothing.  The federal government has little in the way of enforcement against local authorities (although it can cause untold misery to isolated individuals). Everything the federal government does, everything it IS, relies on the people of this country not only cooperating but giving their full support, most of the time.  And that support is slowly, and silently being withdrawn.</p>
<p>The federal government is not long for this world, I think.  It may dissolve.  More likely it will simply become a lame duck, with little access to funds, influence or power.  Worst case scenario, the US could split into smaller countries.</p>
<p>Welcome to the birth of the ethnostate.</p>

		<p>An illegal is a federal law-breaker. </p>
<p>Anyone who discovers an illegal has a citizen&rsquo;s duty to call 911 to report a crime in progress, namely, an illegal trespasser within the United States borders. It is the duty of law enforcement to arrest, detain and deport.</p>
<p>This should be straight forward.</p>

		<p>Agreed Anonymous.  The Federal Government is on it&rsquo;s last legs.  If they try to ram through amnesty for illegals as the next gambit, they will lose even more support, gain even more enmity, and encounter even more nullification bills from States.  In the meantime, let each town and landlord perform stringent credit checks.  Right down to ensuring the identity and credit is not fraudulent, and require that EACH and every adult living in the place - whether initially applying or moving in after rental - undergo the same credit and identity verification.  Odds are, the illegals HAVE no credit and no identity that can be verified, so the rental agents can deny rental.  And if they do present credit information, ensure it IS their information by background checking.  If they fail to produce - deny.  If they allow adults in not on the lease - demand a credit check or evict.  There are many ways to make illegals unwelcome.  <br>
We don&rsquo;t have to rely on the courts.  The benefit of this credit approach ensures NO tenant gets in without a good and extensive credit record, which would also eliminate blacks.  Another approach would be for NO business serving them.  If they come in restaurants, ignore them.  If they come into the hardware store, refuse their business.  If they hang out on the property looking for jobs, have the cops haul them off or call the ICE or Sheriffs.  Whatever and whenever we can make them unwelcome and deny them service, we should.  Their money is NOT as good as ours.  <br>
We don&rsquo;t want their labor, and we don&rsquo;t want their money.  We just want them GONE.</p>

		<p>Political correctness and passing the buck on illegal aliens is destroying this country. Janet Napolitano says we can&rsquo;t forget the &#8220;openess&#8221; on which this country was founded. We sure can when we&rsquo;re at war, and Mexico declared war on us years ago. Our government has been so welcoming, Mexico now thinks they are entitled to all citizen&rsquo;s rights. Let&rsquo;s make sure when the amnesty push starts that Obama et al, don&rsquo;t get their way as they just did with Obamacare. We cannot rest until we get send every illegal home. We can&rsquo;t support outselves much less Mexico. Billions would be saved if illegals left.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t the ordinance be considered legal? After all, American citizens wanting to rent can be denied if they have bad credit or a criminal record? If someone is in the country illegally, isn&rsquo;t that a crime?</p>

		<p>John, for the most part the petition process allows nearly anything to be placed on a ballot.  The restrictions depend on if it would be a state or local ordinance, as do the number of signatures required.  If something does get sufficient votes it is then checked against state or local ordinances and constitutions to ensure it does not conflict.  So in essence, yes anything can be placed.</p>

		<p>Since the Feds will NOT enforce our immigration laws then it is up to the States to enforce their own borders! Why don&rsquo;t the Governors of all states realize this?  Because they are the same as the Feds. </p>

		<p>A way around this would be a local ordinance making it illegal for more than three unrelated people to share a single residence.  The law could be spun as an attempt to prevent college students from turning single-family homes into boarding houses, but it would have the beneficial side-effect of prohibiting anyone else from doing so as well, like the illegal aliens who do this so often.</p>
