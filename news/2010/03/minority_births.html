<h1>Minority Births on Track to Outnumber White Births</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Minorities make up nearly half the children born in the U.S., part of a historic trend in which minorities are expected to become the U.S. majority over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>In fact, demographers say this year could be the &#8220;tipping point&#8221; when the number of babies born to minorities outnumbers that of babies born to whites.</p>
<p>The numbers are growing because immigration to the U.S. has boosted the number of Hispanic women in their prime childbearing years. Minorities made up 48 percent of U.S. children born in 2008, the latest census estimates available, compared to 37 percent in 1990.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The numbers highlight the nation&rsquo;s growing racial and age divide, seen in pockets of communities across the U.S., which could heighten tensions in current policy debates from immigration reform and education to health care and Social Security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites currently make up two-thirds of the total U.S. population, and recent census estimates suggest the number of minorities may not overtake the number of whites until 2050.</p>
<p>Right now, roughly 1 in 10 of the nation&rsquo;s 3,142 counties already have minority populations greater than 50 percent. But 1 in 4 communities have more minority children than white children or are nearing that point, according to the study, which Johnson co-published.</p>
<p>That is because Hispanic women on average have three children, while other women on average have two. The numbers are 2.99 children for Hispanics, 1.87 for whites, 2.13 for blacks and 2.04 for Asians in the U.S. And the number of white women of prime childbearing age is on the decline, dropping 19 percent from 1990.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2008 census estimates used local records of births and deaths, tax records of people moving within the U.S., and census statistics on immigrants. The figures for &#8220;white&#8221; refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity.<br>

		<p>The apocalypse fast approaches.  I predict we will have a few decades of growing disenfranchisement of Whites until that radicalizing point arrives: no White man can get a decent job anywhere. Already it is almost that point, but more minorities means more government intervention to &#8216;protect&rsquo; them(read persecute Whites), more and growing racial strife, etc. I read to much history to be optimistic. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from the original:</p>
<p>&#8220;More white women are waiting until they are older to have children, but it is not yet known whether that will have a noticeable effect on the current trend of increasing minority newborns.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of these articles like the one above always have this celebratory tone when there are many factors ignored that could prevent the minority-majority America.</p>
<p>What these articles always assume is that only immigration occurs. Well, the door swings both ways. Most of these minority births are being paid for by white taxpayers and that cannot continue without an unlikely vast improvement in the economy. When the freebies dry up people will return home. Immigrants can just as quickly turn into emigrants if conditions turn inhospitable. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8221;For America&rsquo;s children, the future is now,&#8221; said Kenneth Johnson, a sociology professor at the University of New Hampshire who researched many of the racial trends in a paper being released Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has no idea just how right he is.</p>
<p>&#8220;But 1 in 4 communities have more minority children than white children or are nearing that point, according to the study, which Johnson co-published.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can we get a list of these counties?  As for the fertility rate listed, I thought that white women in America were at 2.0, not 1.87.</p>

		<p> Notice how in the very first sentence the reporter hails the coming Armageddon for White Americans as part of &#8220;a historic trend,&#8221; as if it had always been as inevitable and unstoppable as the sun&rsquo;s rising in the morning. Wrong!</p>
<p> In 1960 our population was approximately 89 percent Caucasian. Then the Lyndon Johnson landslide Congress of 1965-66, possibly the most mischief-making one in our history, changed the immigration laws to favor admitting the darker races in greater numbers than Europeans. In the years since then, what was once a relative trickle of dark foreigners has become a flood. And that&rsquo;s just the LEGAL immigrants.</p>
<p> Democratic politicians have favored letting in an avalanche of illegals from Mexico and points south because, after all, they&rsquo;ll all vote Democratic, won&rsquo;t they? Republican politicians have failed to do much to stop the invasion of illegals because, after all, American industry needs cheap labor, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p> There you are, my fellow AmReners and White Nationalists. We&rsquo;ve done it to ourselves. Heavy immigration of people who don&rsquo;t look like the race that has been the majority in this country since it was established; coupled with the influence of the feminist movement, which convinced millions of White women that one or two children, if that many, was enough, and that a career is more important than child-raising for women, anyway.</p>
<p> We&rsquo;ve been suckers; we&rsquo;ve been had. And now it&rsquo;s probably too late to do anything about it. IF you could persuade anyone with political power TO do anything about it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t include Muslims in that report, because their birth rate is extremely high.  I predict that one of these days, the blacks and the Mexicans are going to find themselves hopelessly outnumbered by Muslims, and forced to adopt Shariah law&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t THAT be a switch!  The deal is, whites are going to have to &#8220;get busy&#8221; and have a WHOLE lot more kids in a short amount of time if we want to be viable in the future.  We can joke about &#8220;those effing Muslims,&#8221; but we better get some of our own going and fast.  Have a minimum of 4 kids per white family.  That would help a LOT.</p>

<p>Theoretically thay can, but it seems highly improbable. Conditions here would have to get really, really bad    &mdash;   I mean truly terrible   &mdash;   before they would voluntarily return to the countries that many of them got away from.  I don&rsquo;t see that about to happen on any large scale worth counting on.</p>

		<p>Civilized Neighbor says that when the freebies dry up, the immigrants will go home. Well, I hate to tell you this, but the freebies continue coming for the impoverished invaders, they still get their WIC, food stamp cards, free education, free school lunches, substidized housing, etc. etc. I do remember reading somewhere not too long ago that nearly 10% of all biths were to illeagl alien mothers, so if it wasn&rsquo;t for this terrible flaw in the government&rsquo;s system, would we be so close to this apocalyptic tipping point&hellip;</p>

		<p>The implicit point of this article is that the working population of this country will give birth to only the number of children they themselves can support since they are the ones burdened with paying taxes to support the fecundity of everyone else including a burgeoning immigrant underclass.  The population who prefer handouts and depend on the government know that more children equals bigger monthly checks, so they have as many children as they can.  This is the tacit goal when leaving foreign countries to come here to the land of welfare:  more children equal bigger welfare checks, housing, healthcare, food stamps, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a local newspaper so politically incorrect as to still print public &#8220;Births&#8221; should have become alarmed long ago at the rate of immigrant births  &mdash;  most of which one can only assume are WIC births of anchor babies, born with a siphon to the tax coffers. Although certainly over-represented in &#8220;Births&#8221;, another alarming fact is this same population seems to never make Obits, so one can only assume that immigrating to the U.S. either legally or illegally is such a good thing they live forever.  </p>
<p>These are the people our government would reward with citizenship at a time when upwards of 20% of citizens are unemployed.  These are the people who are already over-represented in all classes of entitlement use, overcrowding our schools, bankrupting our hospitals, overflowing our jails, and now flooding our streets to &#8220;come out of the shadows&#8221; and demand all the rights granted to citizens.  </p>
<p>What message should the American people who must work one-half the year just to pay their tax bill, have only as many children as they can personally care for, and pay for the damage these people do to our country have for them as they flood American streets to demand we give up our right to enforce our laws and choose those who are granted citizenship?  The word that comes to mind is not &#8220;Welcome&#8221;.</p>

		<p> Carl Sagan worshippers arise. Many, I should say most, whites believe if they don&rsquo;t reproduce they are saving the trees or some such. Little do they realize the &#8220;unenlightened, undereducated, non productive dark hoards, are reproducing in epic proportions, and as with all parasites they are consuming the host, and since they are rewarded by our facist government,  with larger entitlements, they will continue to do so.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the scariest quote of the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;And the number of white women of prime childbearing age is on the decline, dropping 19 percent from 1990.&#8221;</p>
<p>No explanation was given for this figure, but the only explanation is that the fertility of whites has been dropping for decades and this demographic is the result of white women who forsake, or delayed having children 18 - 25 years ago.  </p>
<p>Having witnessed too many white women not having babies in corporate America the reason for this drop in fertility is all too obvious.  There is no substitute for white women not having babies.  The mathematical results are inescapable as we are seeing now.</p>

<p>Indeed. Which is why repealing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ought to be a top priority for white nationalists. It&rsquo;s a long row to hoe, but it&rsquo;s probably one of the few legislative items within our grasp that could possibly benefit us.</p>

<p>I suspect 2.0 is with Middle Easterners added since they have more children than European Whites. I wonder if these people were added into the percentage of White children? If they were then our children are already a minority.  I wonder how many of these minority births are by illegal aliens?<br>

		<p>Our government really has totally and completely screwed us Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>From a 90% white population, and a country and a government that was favorable to us, while trying to help the black population improve themselves&hellip;..it looks like we are headed for 50% in the next 40 years, and a government that seems to be anti-white (affirmative action, minority set asides for contracts, hate crime laws with a double standards vs whites, etc, etc).</p>
<p>After a 50% white population, the next threshold will be 33%, then 20%, then 10% (and our descendants can experience the joys of living like those Afrikaners in South Africa with all of those rapes and murders).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have to spend an increasing amount of time, effort and money just keeping ourselves safe and protecting our property.</p>
<p>Anyway, unbelievable!  How far this country has fallen in such a short time.  And it was not forced on us.  The stupid morons in our government did this to us.</p>
<p>P.S. And we don&rsquo;t dare say anything about it in public or we will be called evil racists!</p>

		<p>I forgot to include in my previous post the most anti-white policy of all:  The government immigration policy.  The government morons let 1.2 million legal immigrants into this country every year, and the vast majority of them are non-white.  In addition, the government does very little to secure our border with Mexico so there is also a stream of illegal aliens that come in every year.  They have babies on American soil which the stupid morons in our government have decided are US citizens.</p>
<p>It is truly unbelievable.  It looks like we whites have no hope in this country in the long run.  We might be able to survive in fairly large numbers for about another 50 years, but after that our descendants are doomed unless there are some massive changes.  And remember, we were not forced to do this.  We did not lose a war or have some disaster that weakened us to the point of agreeing to do this to ourselves&hellip;.No, it was the stupid morons in our government that have caused this catastrophe.</p>

		<p>   Uh oh, big trouble for people of color.  What happens when there are less white people to put in to the system than there are coloreds to take it out?  You can only tax and take so much before this new majority is going to have to work.  Fortunately for them, they lack the intelligence to figure this out.</p>

<p>I wonder how many whites will avoid having children not because they have been denied any means of making a living to support them, or too burdened with taxes that breed, feed, house and employ swelling hordes of rabidly hostile non-whites, or because the white male has been so pilloried with decades of unceasing anti-white propaganda that white females have been brainwashed to reject them, but  because they do not wish their own children to be condemned to a life under the dominion of hostile aliens.  And how many will fight tooth and nail unto their last breath, as our ancestors did, to not go quietly into the darkness? </p>
<p>So far, we have been walking the gangplank blindfolded.  Even now, only a small part of the body is aware of the imminent peril.  That part is condemned with the rest of the body, should it fail to waken it,  to arrest its suicidal sleep-walk to oblivion, and resist the onslaught of the invading tens and tens of millions.</p>

<p>Civilized:</p>
<p>I read in the msm that a million hispanics have headed for the border because of &#8216;bad living&rsquo; conditions in the US.  I believe little to nothing put out by the msm.  </p>
<p>I believe this will happen:</p>
<p>When the freebies dry up people will not return home. Immigrants can just as quickly turn to rioting and violence if conditions turn inhospitable.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I watched as 100s of thousands of mexicans, legal and illegal marched through Los Angeles carrying sign that read:  &#8220;Europeans go Back to Europe!&#8221;   &#8220;This Land was Stolen from Us!&#8221;  &#8220;Europeans get out!&#8221;  and thought that any small trigger could set this &#8216;peaceful&rsquo; mob into a full-blown raging melee.</p>
<p>One large banner stated:  &#8220;Today we March, tomorrow we Vote!&#8221;  You can be sure they will vote for their own echno-centric socialists who believe raising taxes on the &#8216;rich&rsquo; (read Whites) and businesses is the very best way to run the economy.  Many of this ilk sit in Sacramento right now and there are a lot more of them on the way  &mdash;  promising their people more, unlimited immigration of their own people, more goverment services, more confiscation of wealth from Whites.</p>
<p>Why would they want to go home when the UGS caters to them and their children and punishes NATIVE BORN WHITES at the same time?  What&rsquo;s not to love if you&rsquo;re a White-hating, dirt-poor mexican who believes Whites stole this land from &#8216;your people&rsquo; and that you are poor because Whites stole all the wealth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the land of Native Born Whites is confiscated and re-distributed to non-Whites.  This will start in California and spread eastward.</p>
<p>As the police force, government, justice system and military become increasingly ectho-centric and non-White, there will be no justice for Whites.  The AG of the USG has already declared Civil Rights do not cover Whites.  Whites are the Soviets&rsquo; Kulaks of whom 62 million were shot, burned, electrocuted, locked up in gulags in Siberia never to be seen again, while those at the top lived like kings.</p>
<p>Could it be any clearer?</p>
<p>I read two disturbing things yesterday:</p>
<p>From Bob Livingston:</p>
<p>There are 36 million people on food stamps.</p>
<p>What do you think will happen if the economy collapses and food &#8216;stamps&rsquo; become worthless?   Do you think there will be food riots?</p>
<p>And from the Hemet, a town in California&rsquo;s high desert:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Two recent assassination attempts on Hemet gang task-force officers add to a national trend of more brazen and sophisticated attacks on police, often by gang members, law enforcement experts say.</p>
<p>In one case, the assailants manipulated natural gas line into a building used by the task force, filling it with gas in an attempt to set off an explosion. In the second incident, a weapon was rigged to go off as an officer opened the gate leading to the building. In that case, the round narrowly missed the officer. In Friday&rsquo;s incident, a device described by Wisehart as a booby-trap was attached to the officer&rsquo;s vehicle and fell off as he parked the car.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this,&rsquo; Wisehart said. &#8216;You have to wonder what is going on.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on is California is becoming a socialistic narco-state, exactly like mexico; the gang task force is being attacked by mexican drug gangs, the same ones that operate with impunity in American National Parks.  The police force will become corrupt and in some places it already is.  </p>
<p>There are rumors that they have ties to Middle Eastern terrorist organizations with major weaponry and I have no reason to doubt this.</p>
<p>Call me Cassandra if you wish, I already hear it from Chicken Little types in my own family  &mdash;  but more recently I&rsquo;ve noticed that a number of them are starting to come around.  One asked me where I bought my micro water filters and how did I store water.  He seemed rather nervous when he asked me.</p>

<p>Modern man is driven by lust, he would not care if he was overtaken as long as he was satisfied. Whites appear to be going the way of the dinosaurs without anyone noticing. People simply do not care. Whites will disappear and our history forgotten in favor of the here and now life of sex, television, and movies and celebrities and sports. </p>
<p>Take a good look around. How much longer can our current world last? Can you imagine another thousand years of this? I cannot imagine bringing a child into this world to be a slave to the dark forces around him. I myself can barely contend with them, and I consider myself strong. I know many AmRenners are not spiritual people, but I do suggest reading the likes of Julius Evola, who explain that sinking feeling you have.</p>

<p>Islam is a faith, not a race. As for the people I guess you are talking about - arabs, north africans, turks, central asians etc, they are counted as caucasians in the census and thus add to the &#8220;white&#8221; majority. Most caucasians in the world are not white. Using white and caucasian interchangeably is wrong, caucasian is a much wider category than white. </p>

		<p>Look on the bright side.  Once whites become an official minority it will be difficult to deny whites the right to organize in their racial/ethnic interests.  My only worry is that whites are too individualistic and opinionated to succeed in any real organization.  </p>
<p>Since we have been Americans the longest, we have been dispersed geographically the most and had to compete against other whites the longest.  We replicated the class struggles of Europe among whites.  Our interests may be too disparate and the core program too intolerant towards whites who have variances.  I am thinking of the recent moves by some conservatives to provide a checkoff list for inclusion/exclusion from their club.  Many whites will have one or two items missing and still be very interested in white racial survival.  Most of our most intelligent members are either agnostic or atheists.  Do we reject them because they don&rsquo;t fit into a strict, &#8220;God, Guns, and Jesus&#8221; mentality?  Many historians have remarked that Germany lost the war the moment they turned on the Jews.  The U.S. won largely because of the brain drain Nazi policies of the 1930s created.  So whites who would radicalize and work to &#8220;save the white race&#8221; are going to have to find ways to be inclusive of whites who actually represent the high IQ stats and the majority who will not fit into such narrow qualifications.  Getting over old, useless, and historically false ideas like those that claim Jewish authorship of European/White difficulties and seeking to correct errors in our own construct will be tantamount for any success.</p>
<p>This is why I doubt the future of any white survivalist movement.  But I love love to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>I have been posting on American Renaissance for three years. One of the points that have made over and over again is that the racial transformation is occurring much more rapidly than anyone realizes. It is absolutely crucial at this point in time that you, Jared, in your public appearances focus exclusively on the issue of the race-replacement of in your public appearances. A majority of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS do not understand that they are facing imminent race-replacement. Someone should tell them that it is happening in real-time. You should also talk bout the economic and environmental consequences of race-replacement&hellip;something that I have done many times here in graphic&hellip;. detail.</p>
<p>The racial transformation may be occurring even faster than numbers given in the news today. We need secession from Washington DC. Do not vote Republican any more&hellip;do not vote at all..this is the first step in the process of secession from the beltway.</p>

		<p>I want to show just how dire and insane the situation is going to become in the future. Some people here would like to see an increase in White fertility. Fine. I am all for this.But now consider this:With an increase in White fertility and continuation of current trends, the US population will very rapidly shoot up to a billion. If you toss in amnesty, the US population will hit a billion even more rapidly..very likely less than 25 years..probably half of this time. Not only that, you can toss in the break up of the US along racial lines. The White population will be expanding in a vastly shrunken living space for White Amerians. In the nonwhite areas, the human population will explode. It is going to be a catastrophe..and it is highly likely to happen.</p>

<p>It was supposed to put an end to illegal aliens, but it didn&rsquo;t.  It only provided an encouragement for more of them to come.</p>
<p>And they did!  They kept pouring in.  Will another amnesty be any different?</p>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
We WERE forced to do it, by the enormous and uncontested power of a government which has gotten out of our control. It has fallen into the hands of interests who do not identify with the majority and who do not have the interests of the majority at heart.  When you study the situation, it turns out that this silent, unremitting war against the majority has been going on throughout the 20th century and we are only now really seeing the results come out into the open. </p>
<p>We allowed it to happen only because we  (especially our young) were brainwashed to believe that our country was flawed and needed fixing;  that our position [as whites] was unassailably secure and we could well afford to give away a few paltry benefits;  that it was the right and moral thing to do;  and finally, that it was &#8220;the American way&#8221;. &hellip; so we were told by every Hollywood movie for the last 50 years at least.</p>
<p>And PS, all this was not brought about by &#8220;morons&#8221;&hellip; they knew exactly what they were doing.   It was WE who didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing.</p>

		<p>Many people that I know who are in their thirties are not married and have no children.  What are they waiting for?  Do these women think they are going to have children after forty?  What about the guys?  It is true that men do no have the same reproductive biological clock that women do but when they finally decide that they are ready to settle down they will be settling down with women who are past their reproductive age.  People have to start thinking about marriage in their early twenties.  I don&rsquo;t mean that they have to marry in their early twenties but they should start thinking about marriage when they reach twenty.  That way they will be looking for good partners and learning about the good qualities to look for in a spouse.  I think that this living together custom has spoiled people.  They are looking for some unrealistic perfect standard in their mates so they never marry.  Too many people are living an adolescent lifestyle well into their adult years.  They are wasting their young reproductive years living with this one and that one rather than getting serious and getting married.  If you are afraid of a bad marriage, do you think that a lonely old age is better?</p>
<p>Another thing that causes people to delay childbearing is the competition for the biggest house.  Many young couples could purchase smaller homes, a generation ago families raised their children in five room or six room ranch houses.  Now everyone wants the macmasion.  It is ironic that the smaller families have become, the larger the houses have become. </p>

<p>You are 100% correct. Most white people DON&rsquo;T know we are about to become the minority in our own country. When I say this to people, the look on their faces is quite shocking. Then they start asking questions. I&rsquo;m finding it harder and harder to remain silent, and bring the subject up every chance I get, even at work. Risky? Perhaps. But I agree with you.

what you arote about the traitor Rinnie Reagan is a fact. His amnesty program was a completet disaster. The imbecile Roger Connor who was the head of FAIR at the time went along with it.</p>
<p>My point about amnesty this time around is this:unlike the 1986 amnesty, the passage of amnesty in 2010 will have immediate horrific consequences for NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. The taunting and persecution would commence almost immediately after the passage of amnesty. This is obvious. Millions of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS would have to deal with the consequences of post 1965 immigration on an everyday basis. I&rsquo;ve writen about this in detail in previous posts on this web site. But basically, the choice is this:do you want to deal with amnesty now or twenty years from now?</p>
<p>Also, the passage of amnesty will put Roy Beck and numbersusa.com out of business. White Americans will either financially support White Naationalism or be race-replaced&hellip;more money for this website. The passage of amnesty will trigger a White Revolt. I say this with 100 percent certainty.</p>

Old and young, healthy and sick, men and women, and even infants and infirm, were killed in cold-blood. They were not combatants in civil war or rebellions, they were not criminals. Indeed, nearly all were guilty of &hellip; nothing.</p>
<p>Part of this mass killing was genocide, as in the wholesale murder of hundreds of thousands of Don Cossacks in 1919, the intentional starving of about 5,000,000 Ukrainian peasants to death in 1932-33, or the deportation to mass death of 50,000 to 60,000 Estonians in 1949. Part was mass murder, as of the wholesale extermination of perhaps 6,500,000 &#8216;kulaks&rsquo; (in effect, the better off peasants and those resisting collectivization) from 1930 to 1937, the execution of perhaps a million Party members in the Great Terror of 1937-38, and the massacre of all Trotskyites in the forced labor camps.</p>
<p>In fact, we have witnessed in the Soviet Union a true egalitarian social cleansing and flushing: no group or class escaped, for everyone and anyone could have had counter-revolutionary ancestors, class lineage, counter-revolutionary ideas or thought, or be susceptible to them&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>On his research and sources he cites for Death by Government, he writes: </p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yhxdaqg" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yhxdaqg</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In developing the statistics for this and the previous three volumes, almost 8,200 estimates of war, domestic violence, genocide, mass murder, and other relevant data, were recorded from over a thousand sources. I then did over 4,200 consolidations and calculations on these estimates and organized everything into tables of estimates, calculations, and sources totaling more than 18,100 rows. My intent is to be as explicit and public as possible so that others can evaluate, correct, and build on this work&hellip; The appendices for this book were too massive to include here (one appendix table alone amounts to over 50 pages) and are given in a supplementary volume titled Statistics of Democide&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Please read through the articles on Soviet Democide with the links I&rsquo;ve provided  &mdash;  they are fascinating to say the least.  The Professor provides tables, graphs and pie charts to clarify his findings  &mdash;  his books and articles are not pedants and in fact are easy to read.  He says he writes to make the information clear for his college students. </p>
<p>Professor Rummel provides space on his site where anyone is free to refute or contest his research  &mdash;  he welcomes any/all new information and has updated (as is upwards) his murder totals for some regimes in the past few years as new data become available.</p>

Browser, what you arote about the traitor Rinnie Reagan is a fact. His amnesty program was a completet disaster. </p>
<p>****************************</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget that Reagan (the same Reagan so beloved by &#8220;con&#8221;servatives   &mdash;   ie. people who&rsquo;ve been conned)&hellip; received immediately after leaving office a good-bye &#8220;gift&#8221; of $5 million from Japanese businesses. This outrage provoked very little objection from his adoring worshipers, although I found it shocking in its brazenness.  It SHOULD have been enough to get him arrested and put behind bars, or at least to spend the rest of his years living in disgrace instead of adulation.  The shame of it!</p>
<p>Receiving your &#8220;bribe&#8221; AFTER you have left office is very clever, but that makes it no less a bribe, and it should be no less a crime.  (And from foreign elements at that!!!)</p>
<p>And those same starry-eyed  <i>con-</i>servatives went on to elect two more generations of Bushes, giving us two more wars, and always hoping for improvement right around the corner (but never getting it). Good grief, they never learn!  </p>
<p>So just look at where we are now.  I give equal thanks to both the way-out lefties  who voted for Clinton &amp; Obama, and the myopic &#8216;<i>con&rsquo;</i>servatives who supported Reagans and Bushes, all of whom have brought us to this. </p>

		<p>Many people don&rsquo;t realize this, as poster 52 points out, that there are a lot of whites in odd places.  The reason why there are so many whites in Turkey is because most are actually &#8216;turkesized&rsquo; Greeks who were there when the Turks first came in.  In Syria, the Crusaders interbred with the Arabs for two centuries, and before that, Greeks were all over the place in syria and Lebanon.  Other white groups have also moved around in Persia and even into Central Asia.  There are more whites around the world than we often recognize.  We may just have to expand our definition of cultures a bit.</p>

		<p>I agree with Jupiter.  Most whites have no clue what is happening and how it is about to get worse.  My sister moved to South Carolina few years ago and lives in a small all white subdivision.  She recently took a part time teaching job in a local school and was surprised to find that the majority of the kids were Mexican Spanish speakers.</p>
<p>I tried to tell her, while on the phone, that it&rsquo;s happening everywhere and that we&rsquo;re about to lose our country, and she couldn&rsquo;t grasp the concept.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the bulk of whites still live in non-integrated areas, and the minorities are filling up the cities so fast that they&rsquo;ve squeezed the remaining whites into a corner, but it&rsquo;s just begun that they&rsquo;re bursting out into the suburbs and the whites there are asking, &#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>All the school failure problems that are happening in the suburbs are happening in the backdrop of mostly white home owners having to educate a ballooning non-white student body.  In about 15 years, the suburbs will be full and the next round of minority (majority) expansion will really push into small town America.  That&rsquo;s when the whites will really wake up, but by then, it will be too late.</p>
<p>One strategy is to get in the Asian bubble.  Live in an upper or middle class asian neighborhood because they have no time for blacks or browns and cannot be swayed by calls to social justice. Look at California where Asians literally build these iron cocoons and keep blacks and latinos out.  Asians generally like whites and consider us about on their same level.  </p>

I really don&rsquo;t agree that there are no Whites in Turkey, North Africa, Arabia, Armenia, the Caucasus, Iran, Afghanistan, etc. </p>
<p>Further, a good 35% of Turks are &ldquo;White Turks.&rdquo; While most Arabs, Berbers, Afghans, Pakistanis, etc, are not exactly White, some are.  There are &ldquo;White Arabs.&rdquo; Look at Assad of Syria. There are also &ldquo;White Berbers.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I agree exactly with Robert Lindsay here. Through centuries of importation of slaves, merchants, soldiers, from the Balkans and the Steppes, and in fact from all over Europe, there is a very large population of whites there. I&rsquo;m sure they have no idea what their origins were and consider themselves Turks.   And whites there are not devalued, as they are here. Nor are they made to grovel and feel guilty.  As in Latin America, they are the upper class.   Indeed, it could be said that Turkey is today a much &#8220;whiter&#8221; country than the USA (where whites are almost no longer the majority). The same goes for ALL of those countries he mentioned, where significant populations of whites are to be found.  </p>
<p>But these are mixed societies straddling  a racial borderline.  ON THE WHOLE,  their populations are more dusky, Semitic, Mediterranean &hellip; whatever, something like that.  It&rsquo;s hard to find the right word for it; we don&rsquo;t seem to have a right word.  But they are not (on the average) what most Europeans would consider as &#8220;white&#8221;.  Yes, Berbers (pure Berbers) are white. Yes, there are the Assad&rsquo;s, and many others too, but they are somewhat the exceptions to the rule.</p>

		<p>Jupiter&hellip; You are 100% correct. Most white people DON&rsquo;T know we are about to become the minority in our own country. When I say this to people, the look on their faces is quite shocking. Then they start asking questions. I&rsquo;m finding it harder and harder to remain silent, and bring the subject up every chance I get, even at work. Risky? Perhaps. <br>
NBJ<br>

<p>It need not be &#8220;risky&#8221;. Just quote the statistic in a matter-of-fact way, and leave it at that.  Let them ponder it and draw their own conclusions. Don&rsquo;t offer any opinions, don&rsquo;t editorialize. No need!  They would have to be brain-dead not to realize the implications and see the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>I agree that most white people don&rsquo;t know, and they NEED TO BE TOLD. Hardly anyone is telling them   &mdash;   certainly not the media.  When somebody does mention it (as Pres. Clinton), it is presented in a celebratory way   &mdash;   as if something wonderful is about to happen and we should all be thrilled.</p>
<p>Useful idiots like Pres. Clinton regardless, I submit that the prospect is  chilling, not thrilling.</p>

		<p>Robert Lindsay, I have to disagree about all these &#8220;Whites&#8221; from the Middle East.  They may be Caucasian, but they&rsquo;re not White.  The two groups I&rsquo;m most familiar with, Iranians and Armenians, can be easily sorted out on sight from a group of Europeans.  The Iranians in particular are much darker that we are.  And Caucasian or not, THEY see themselves as different from us.  I don&rsquo;t know the rude Iranian word for non-Iranians, but to the Armenians, we&rsquo;re all just a bunch of oodars.  They have got affirmative action quotas for themselves in Pasadena and Glendale, which makes them enemies of Whites as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.  And the Iranians, of course, are Moslems, and members of the Shiite sect, which makes them unwelcome among other Moslems.  They are unwanteds even among the unwanteds.  We had a fine country without these people, and I hope to have it back one day.  </p>

<p>It is foolish and misguided to assume they are all Muslims.  Many are not. That is just sloppy stereotyping.  And not all with Armenian-sounding names are Armenians either.

		<p>It is not foolish and misguided to claim that all Iranians are Shiite Moslems.  There may be a few who have converted to other religions, just like some Jews become Christians, but their numbers are insignificant.  Whether they are observant is another question, but they are culturally Shiite.  As some Irish politician said, &#8220;We have Catholic atheists and Protestant atheists&#8221;.<br>
     There are other religions in Iran, but they&rsquo;re not Iranians.  They&rsquo;re Armenians, Jews, Kurds, or some other distinct national group.  They may have Iranian passports, but they don&rsquo;t consider themselves Iranian, and neither do the real Iranians.  </p>

		<p>There are a lot of Persian Jews in the LA area, who are very different culturally from Ashkenazim (Northern European Jews).<br>
As for Armenians, they clearly look different on average from Northern Europeans, so if that is your criterion for &#8220;White&#8221;, surely they don&rsquo;t meet it. On the other hand, those who consider darker South Euros like Penelope Cruz or Stanley Tucci to be &#8220;White&#8221; would be unlikely to exclude most Armenians.</p>
