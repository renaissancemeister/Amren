<h1><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2010/0308/Obama-administration-more-civil-rights-enforcement-in-schools">Obama Administration: More Civil Rights Enforcement in Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Paulson, Christian Science Monitor, March 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Education Secretary Arne Duncan signaled Monday the Obama administration&rsquo;s intention to step up enforcement of civil rights laws that apply to schools and colleges, many of which are often ignored.</p>
<p>In remarks delivered in Selma, Ala, timed to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the marches in which civil rights protesters were brutally attacked by police, Secretary Duncan said, &#8220;The truth is that, in the last decade, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has not been as vigilant as it should have been in combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities. But that is about to change .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are going to reinvigorate civil rights enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In particular, Duncan {snip} highlighted certain indicators that point to inequities existing today:</p>
<p>* Upon finishing high school, white students are about six times more likely to be college-ready in biology than African-American students. In algebra, they&rsquo;re four-plus times more likely.</p>
<p>* Just 12 percent of high schools produce half the dropouts in America. Three-fourths of African-American and Latino come from those schools.</p>
<p>* African-American students without disabilities are more than three times as likely to be expelled as their white peers.</p>
<p>Duncan also pointed to a Denver Post investigation that showed that three-quarters of teachers who had been let go and had trouble finding another teaching job over the past four years were placed in high-poverty schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Ali [Russlynn Ali, assistant secretary of education for civil rights] said, &#8220;You can expect to see our compliance reviews be a little broader in terms of issues&#8221; than in the past. The OCR, she said, will also be issuing 17 guidance letters to schools over a wide range of civil rights issues, including disabilities, access to math and science (or STEM) courses, sexual violence, and food allergies.</p>
<p>Rather than just determining whether a district complies with the letter of the law in certain areas, the department will look at what the outcomes are for students, Duncan said in the conference call. &#8220;This is really about us trying to close achievement gaps,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Professor Orfield [Gary Orfield, a professor at University of California in Los Angeles and co-director of the Civil Rights Project] says he hopes the administration will make a concentrated effort on issues like segregation  &mdash;  which has grown harder to make strides in after a 2007 Supreme Court case restricted the ways that districts can use race in determining which schools students attend. He also hopes it will follow up the tough rhetoric with real repercussions for districts that don&rsquo;t comply, such as withholding funding.</p>

		<p>Whites pay the majority of taxes in this country, so any tax increase to pay for &#8220;closing the achievement gap&#8221; falls upon them disproportionately and is de facto disparate impact, an injustice, and direct White dispossession of their property and happiness for the sake of afrovoodoos and the government administrators who manage the scam.</p>
<p>Those who are on the inside know that achievement gap can&rsquo;t be closed because of IQ and inclinations, but they keep insisting because they benefit directly from the money transfers from Whites to the government.  They will ALWAYS have the achievement gap to mau mau, thus a permanent cause and eternal claim for more money from Whites to pay for more black privileges.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t last. The awakening quickens. </p>

		<p>The only way for all this to come to pass is to make elementary, secondary and post-secondary education so blindingly simple that all but those with blatant developmental disabilities can pass.  A combination of grade inflation and course title inflation will mask racial differences, and the SATs, ACTs and Regents style tests will be so dumbed down that they&rsquo;ll essentially be useless.</p>

Troublemakers are now portrayed as victims</p>
<p><br>
<i>&#8220;department will look at what the outcomes are for students&#8221;</i><br>
In other words, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the school is following the law; they want to see high scoring minorities or else. </p>

		<p>The only way they can &#8220;close the achievement gap&#8221; is to hold down the white and Asian students, which would of course be illegal.  However, I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t to &#8220;find a way&#8221; to worm out of that little technicality.  They are flat not going to make the blacks and the Mexicans any smarter.  Their only recourse is to make the smart kids appear dumber.</p>

		<p>So here we have Arne Duncan, the WHITE education secretary for Obama clinging to the idea that somehow, someway we&rsquo;re still going to be able to close the achievement gap despite all the futile efforts that have been put forth over the last 40+ years. When is this madness ever going to end? Probably the only thing that would end this nonsense is scientific proof that the genes for intelligence are not distributed equally across the different races. In that event, it would be come clear that the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; was really a genetic gap ordained by the forces of nature, and not something that can be magically whisked away by the &#8220;right&#8221; government programs.   </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re confusing equality of opportunity and equality of outcome.  The former is a reasonable expectation, the latter is not.  No amount of money or White reverse-ethnocentrism will fix the &#8220;achievement gap.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Secretary of Education Arne Duncan: &#8220;This [stepped-up civil rights scrutiny of schools] is really about us trying to close achievement gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>A succinct definition of the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) https://www.subnet.nga.org/educlear/achievement/index.html</p>
<p>Closing the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is the major goal of government schooling.  It has been for 40 years. One result is a profusion of curricular and pedogogical &#8220;innovations.&#8221; An illustrative example: &#8220;white guilt&#8221; literature and history.</p>
<p>Diane Ravitch, though a Democrat, served Bush I as an assistant sectretary of education and served Clinton on the National Assessment of Governing Board.  Here is NYU Professor Ravitch&rsquo;s description of the bias guidelines for textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill: </p>
<p>&#8220;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&#8221; (The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn, p. 44) </p>
<p>NOTE: All publishers with aspirations of selling textbooks to government schools preemptively censor their own books by use of elaborate &#8220;bias and sensitivity&#8221; guidelines.   </p>

		<p>If white parents don&rsquo;t do everything in their power to get their kids away from black thugs, this community organizer is going to make their lives even more miserable than they already are.  As it is, the white kids can&rsquo;t begin to concentrate on studies where blacks attend, due to the trouble-making black miscreants.</p>
<p>If this community organizer thinks that something other than black lack of intelligence is to blame for black failure he&rsquo;s dumber than I thought.</p>
<p>Nothing will improve black achievement unless the administration blatantly cheats on tests scores, which is a very real possibility.   </p>
<p>This black miscreant is turning out to be even worse than I originally thought he would be, and this Holder is even worse.</p>
<p>Jobs are still being lost, and we&rsquo;re in the shadows of a commercial real estate crash that portends to be even bigger than the sub-prime and this evil black is concentrating on healthcare, gun control, giving illegals amnesty and now he&rsquo;s stepping up his Gestapo tactics in the schools.  Everything but keeping the economy from crashing again.</p>
<p>Rush is probably right.  The Obamanation wants to see capitalism crash, because he thinks he can restructure the system along that of Venezuela or Cuba where blacks don&rsquo;t have to be qualified to get top notch employment.</p>
<p>If that really is his goal, he&rsquo;s a fool if he thinks he can collapse the system and venture into another without having societal upheaval that will tear this country apart.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a &#8220;crisis&#8221; is something other elements in this country are waiting for, too.  I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s too dumb to know that.  And too arrogant as well.</p>
<p>Blacks will rue the day they elected this evil black monster.</p>

		<p>This is why our perspective is so desperately needed.  Black Americans are living a perfect storm of failure, they are the measuring rod of misery in this country, but nobody can come up with any solutions besides blaming Whites and spending more money.  The tragedy of it all is heart-rending.  Will no one but us help America take the blinders off?  <br>
     America!  You have a set of phenomena that troubles you.  You try and try, but nothing seems to work.  Every &#8220;success&#8221; is followed by more pleas for help.  If those &#8220;successes&#8221; were real, then we could apply the lessons learned to the rest of Black America, and put an end to those bothersome phenomena.  But, Alas!  The successes are not real.  The phenomena continue.  <br>
     It&rsquo;s time, America, to consider the possibility of racial differences.  Equality has not worked.  You have given it every chance, deprived millions of White men of good jobs in order to give them to deserving others, ruined your schools, exposed more millions of Whites to assault, robbery, rape, and murder, and the phenomena still won&rsquo;t go away.  No one can say you didn&rsquo;t try, America.  Now sit down and think real hard, what else might be the cause of Black crime, ignorance, and the whole spectrum of Black phenomena?  Stupidity?  Might that be the answer?  Well, you&rsquo;ll never know until you at least look at the possibility.  </p>

		<p>Well, they might as well try to enforce SOMETHING - maybe they can excel in civil rights; they certainly have failed at enforcing behavior and academics. Perhaps instead of looking at the schools for failure, they should look at the students attending those schools, and connect the dots in what all they have in common: single parent, no structure in their home life, no discipline, no supervision, on and on&hellip;</p>

		<p>After reading the article I&rsquo;m still not sure what it means. There seems to be some sense of outrage but it reminds me of a man swinging his arms wildly in the air at no one in particular.</p>
<p>The Secretary of Education apparently &#8220;highlighted certain indicators&#8221; like &#8220;upon finishing high school, white students are about six times more likely to be college-ready in biology than African-American students. In algebra, they&rsquo;re four-plus times more likely.&#8221; </p>
<p>What exactly does that have to with civil rights enforcement? I fail to see how the above can be linked to various legal statutes related to civil rights. </p>
<p>Perhaps most blacks are simply poor students and are unable to handle academic endeavors. You&rsquo;d think this would be obvious by now to anyone with even the most basic powers of observation. </p>
<p>This is really a crass attempt to conjure up yet another excuse for low-performing blacks. I don&rsquo;t understand how enforcing nebulous rules will change anything.</p>

		<p>Would someone point out to me just one school, somewhere, anywhere, that is 100% black, with an all black teaching staff, that is out performing any predominately white school. I&rsquo;m not talking about basketball or step team dancing. Without those evil white devils (teachers) to pollute those fertile black minds it should be so much easier to shine, and a lot less to complain about.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that the Detroit school system would be a shining example of black academic achievement? </p>

<p>When the man was in Chicago, he came out of nowhere [sounds familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it] to take over the Chicago school system, and did just about nothing in that capacity. So the same when at the fed level.</p>
<p>And disability is defined as having anger management problems? Kid that beats up his white classmates on a habitual basis and has to be told by the teacher to stop talking a dozen times during a hour-long class is &#8220;disabled&#8221;?</p>

   Now I understand why BHO picked Arne (the Yo-Yo) Duncan to run the Dept of eduacation instead of Paul Vallas- the man who reformed the schools. Vallas would be improving the schools.</p>

		<p>As an educator, to even hint of a &#8220;genetic gap&#8221; in the public or private school system is professional suicide.  Therefore, the achievement gap will always be pursued.  Most educators know the facts, but must keep it to themselves in mixed company.</p>

		<p>The important word here is &#8220;enFORCEment&#8221;.  BHO and his Commissar, Ms Ali, plan on using the threat of punishment to get the education workers to meet their production quotas for edjumacated Blacks.  Are they really so ignorant as to expect anyone to raise Blacks to a White level, or are they using an impossible task as justification to punish whoever they wish?  I think it was Joseph Sobran who wrote about how you can keep people in line more easily if they&rsquo;re always in violation of some law or other.  With Black failure as an infallible justification, the State can punish any teacher at any time for failing to teach.  It&rsquo;s like driving with a suspended license: you&rsquo;d better be real careful what you do because five mph over the limit can put you in jail.  </p>

		<p>I had a Jewish liberal woman as a principal once.  She was a dyed in the wool social justice racial Marxist lady to the max.  The students were 100% non-white, and a large part of them were illiterate (in high school).  There was a lot of trouble and violence in the school, too.  She always sided with the students over the teachers, and she would tell us all the time that that was natural for her as &#8216;an advocate for the child.&rsquo;  That sounds nice in theory, but the &#8216;children&rsquo; in question were fully grown men of 18, 19 or 20 years old, and they were mostly gangbangers and thugs.</p>
<p>We had a couple of new teachers one year who, surprisingly, were not in the liberal marxist social justice mode of thinking.  They were giving the lazy thugs grades like teachers used to give them - you get what you earn.  Needless to say, almost no one passed their classes, and justifiably so (I had all the same students and they were, in a word, five or more grade levels behind).</p>
<p>Well, you can imagine the principal.  She harassed both of them continuously and ran them out of the school.  The rest of us took note and had wonderful pass rates.  The next year I had an A/A admin.  Same story.  We who need jobs toe the line, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel good at all seeing the downward trend and knowing it is coming from above through pressure and intimidation.</p>

This is going to turn into a witch hunt.</p>
<p>White teachers are going to be asked why their white students do better than their black students. The only answer the grand inquisitors will accept is the confession by the white teacher that they&rsquo;re a racist.</p>
<p>Young and idealistic white teachers won&rsquo;t know what hit them.<br>

		<p>The problem with schools can be summed up in three words&hellip;Department of Education.</p>
<p>This illegal federal agency is what allows radicals like Obama to set the agenda at your local school when nobody in the community agrees with it.  Since very few communities &#8220;agree with it&#8221;, this is actually a form of extreme tyranny that now has crossed the line into soviet style brainwashing and secret police style monitoring for &#8220;thought crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>The solution is simple and direct, abolish the Department of Education.  A president could do this without support of congress, if he chose to.</p>
<p>Only one candidate of either party has said he will do this.</p>
<p>That man is Ron Paul.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why Obama doesn&rsquo;t understand this.  He&rsquo;s half white after all.  So there&rsquo;s no way he can understand the problems encountered while trying to educate the average IQ74 we have out there.  He has a genetic advantage!<br>
Grobbbbbbbb</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s government encourages the invading hoards who consume our resources and displace Americans.  Americans no longer have friends or a voice in America.</p>

&#8220;Without those evil white devils (teachers) to pollute those fertile black minds it should be so much easier to shine, and a lot less to complain about. Wouldn&rsquo;t you think that the Detroit school system would be a shining example of black academic achievement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, or how about the DC schools where the per student costs are the higest in the nation, yet their performance is among the lowest?</p>
<p>The truth of black inability and incompetence and lack of intelligence can&rsquo;t be told.  If it were, there would be mass riots leading to civil war.  So they continue playing as if blacks are equal and pretending to be stumped as to why blacks are gross underachievers.</p>
<p>Note also that they NEVER EVER point out that there is an achievement gap between blacks and every other ethnicity and race besides whites.</p>
<p>Now, I wonder why that is? <br>

		<p>This might have a good effect. A part of the issue is the disparity in suspension and expulsion rates. All hell might break loose when schools are coerced by the Obama people to keep Black and Hispanic thugs in school to reveal the truth. Even though we looked for this with &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221;, lefties countered that the Black/Hispanic disparity that resulted was because not enough money was being spent on their needs. In these money strapped times that counter must be dealt with.</p>

		<p>Arne Duncan was busy meddling with the chicago public schools when BHO brought him up. Duncan was clueless in chicago as well, scratching his head about why urban blacks were graduating at a rate of less than 1 in 5. He refuses to recognize that the bell curve does exist, and pushed the CPS curriculum toward college prep and eliminated or greatly diminished industrial arts, where some may have at least learned the basics of a trade&hellip;..Why should we be surprised that he still has the same blank, vaguely confused look on his face?</p>
<p>I was sent a job offer last week for a series of CPS Principal Positions, all highlighted an annual salary of over 100K. These people are robbing us blind! </p>

		<p>&#8221;* Just 12 percent of high schools produce half the dropouts in America. Three-fourths of African-American and Latino come from those schools.<br>
* African-American students without disabilities are more than three times as likely to be expelled as their white peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer for the Obama administration is apparently to pressure and punish local school administrators until they create rigged &#8220;equal&#8221; results - between one group with an average IQ of 100 and another with an average IQ of 80. Much like trying to combine mercury and water.</p>
<p>Besides within our federal government, the only optimism to be found for this approach is among the inmates of an Insane Asylum. <br>
