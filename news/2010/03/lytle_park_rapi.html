		<p>&#8220;The third incident actually happened first, but Black was only indicted after the victim recognized his picture in news reports related to the other two cases&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or decided to come forward seeing there was now less a chance of being disparaged as another girl of privilege harassing blacks, putting them in jail. In the new more &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; world we live in race trumps sex.  </p>

<p>I guess after the first &#8216;two&rsquo; incidents the perp figured himself a true expert on the subject. He was just trying to score points for &#8216;keeping it real&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I live in the area and this story got very little air play. In fact this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it. The same with the black morgue worker who &#8220;raped&#8221; white corpses. It was a story, but not a huge one. The big stories around here are the ones where not enough black contractors are being used for local projects or stories of other &#8220;racist&#8221; acts against blacks by Whites. </p>
<p>There is a current story that is geting top billing. A black serial killer (anthony kirkland)who raped, tortured, burned and killed local women. But some of his victims were non Whites. This makes it a story. Had all his victims been White, I probably never would have heard anything of it. </p>

		<p>By the way, I notice there is no talk of hate crime charges despite the racist slurs by the black rapist. Think of this next time you here some racial McCarthite yodeling about how most hate crime charges are against whites.</p>

		<p>Unfortuneately, I have to go into Over-the-Rhine at least once a week on business (legal, I assure you)  I never travel to that part of Cincinnati without a weapon. Once upon a time, this part of town was settled by German immigrants. It was a showpiece of Cincinnati, but then, as blacks moved in, whites moved out, well, you know the rest of the story. It is truly a shame.</p>

		<p>Mr. Black has committed serious crimes, and deserves serious punishment. But I have no sympathy for the first and third women involved;they were engaging in criminal activities in what they must have known was a dangerous area. To me their situations are the same as someone driving while intoxicated who is injured in a self inflicted auto accident. <br>
The second was certainly engaged in what was risky behavior. Hopefully, this will alert other women to its dangers.</p>

		<p>No matter what anyone says, these stupid white females met with these lowlifes on THEIR OWN FREE WILL.  Amreners and White Nationalists will never, ever admit that many white females are their own and our worst enemies.  They&rsquo;re responsible for most of the miscegenation in this country and in Europe.  Every time I mention this it never gets posted.  Ironically however I keep reading these stories on Amren ad infinitum.  History just keeps repeating itself with ever increasing frequency.  Anyone see a pattern here.  Hmmmmmm?</p>

		<p>Appropriate last name. Let us estimate tha this guy will cost ohio $50,000 a year to incarcerate for the next 40 years that comes to 2 million dollars.That estimate is probably low. I am sure Ohio is hurting as much as other states for money.I wonder if we will finally bring back $10 worth of rope on the courthouse lawn?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black, dubbed the Lytle Park rapist because one of his victims was raped at 9 a.m. in the Downtown public park, became a poster child for those calling for a NEW JAIL.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black had been arrested five times in the previous six months but RELEASED each time because there was no room in the jail for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t those quotes pretty much sum it up?  &#8220;calling for a new jail&#8221;  If people would start calling for a new gallows they could call for less jails.</p>
<p>Arrested and released FIVE times in six monthes.  Gee, why was this guy a repeat offender?  I can just envision the grin on his face each time he walked.  Disgusting. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Nobody cares about a white b &mdash;  &mdash; in Over-the-Rhine,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine if the a White had said &ldquo;Nobody cares about a black b &mdash;  &mdash; in Idaho,&rdquo;  Oh, my God!  There would be non-stop 24/7 media coverage for months.  There would be commissions, investigations, plays, books, movies, and university classes devoted to this horrible racial incident.  The phrase &#8220;Nobody cares about a black b  &mdash;    &mdash;  .&#8221; would become an iconic phrase used for the next 100 years by Blacks and liberals everywhere and always.  </p>
<p>But, if that phrase is said by a Black rapist to a White victim, then there is virtually no exposure in the media.  Do you still believe that there is Not a double-standard in America and that the Media are NOT its main advocates?  Never trust the main stream Media.<br>

<p>We will never be anywhere near having a legal system that considers not teaching your children to discriminate a crime.  In fact, since I wrote my initial comment yesterday, I have come to realize that many kids today have grown up bombarded by messages that tell them that association with blacks and other minorities is not only safe, but they have an obligation to engage.  Even if parents tried to make their children more aware of the reality, many children would rebel against such instruction and &#8220;show them&#8221; by doing things like dating, etc., let alone trusting a young black man is going to treat them with respect when they are obviously flouting traditional taboos already.  Since about 1968 young women have been &#8220;showing us&#8221; how defiant they can be.  The social chaos of today is certainly due to this origin and the popular and mistaken ideas it has managed to parlay into mainstream assumptions.</p>

<p>You have to admit, Over the Rhine is what in old movies would be called a tenement slum. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t think places like that exist anymore in the USA. But it&rsquo;s still there in a large neighborhood in Cincinnati. Sure, if you have quite an imagination, one could imagine it fixed up an shiny, but it is a place filled with very old, dilapidated, multistory buildings</p>
