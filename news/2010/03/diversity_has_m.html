<h1>Diversity Has Many Shades in Halls of Learning</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anthony Reinhart, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The faces of Canada&rsquo;s future are not hard to find at the University of Toronto. They are everywhere, including the cafeteria of the medical sciences building, where framed faces of the past line the halls.</p>
<p>The difference between the two sets of faces is colour. Those in the frames, depicting bygone anatomy professors, are white. The ones in the cafeteria come in all shades, and bring to life Statistics Canada&rsquo;s latest projections: that people of South Asian descent will continue to form the country&rsquo;s largest visible minority group, and will make up one-quarter of the Toronto area&rsquo;s population by 2031.</p>
<p>For students at the vanguard of this ascendant group of Canadians, the numbers point to prospects their parents might never have had, but also to challenges as they find their place in an ever-more-diverse society.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was asked a few months ago what it means to be Canadian, and it was difficult to explain,&#8221; said Areeba Jawaid, 22. Born to Pakistani parents in the Middle Eastern sultanate of Oman, Ms. Jawaid was 10 when her family moved to Canada.</p>
<p>To her, life as a South Asian Canadian in Toronto means access to a growing number of cultural centres, shops and mosques that cater to her cultural and faith needs, but it also means connecting to broader Canadian life and to people of other backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very important that people come out and see other people&rsquo;s cultures and what they bring to Canada,&#8221; Ms. Jawaid said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s only through learning about each other that we can really respect each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a familiar refrain among her South Asian friends at the university yesterday, who included a Hindu born in Canada to ethnic Indians from Guyana, a Bengali Muslim and a young Indian man, also a Hindu. Canadians of all backgrounds should celebrate their heritage, but should also resist retrenching behind walls of ethnicity and religion in mono-cultural enclaves, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, everyone comes together and what comes out is a unique Canadian culture &hellip; people who have been exposed to all these different cultures, and we&rsquo;ll have what we call the truly global citizen,&#8221; said Gaurav Sharma, 21, who came to Canada from India at 15.</p>
<p>To varying degrees, the students said, their parents have encouraged them to pursue the dual goals of adhering to aspects of their South Asian heritage while embracing Canadian life.</p>
<p>Remaining apart while becoming part of a larger whole need not be conflicting pursuits, said Ravi Purushuttam, a 21-year-old born in Markham to second-generation Guyanese Indians.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will require &#8220;a lot of effort,&#8221; more than Canadians are expending today, to truly understand each other, Mr. Purushuttam said.</p>
<p>Peaceful coexistence and mere tolerance aren&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you need to put aside the political correctness and ask the hard questions&#8221; about other people&rsquo;s cultural and religious practices, whether it&rsquo;s the Hindu caste system, the Muslim concept of jihad or the Christian quest to convert.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Canada; its very nature is to be multi-ethnic and a very inclusive place; but whether we&rsquo;re just ignoring the differences or getting used to it, I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you actually understand that other person?&#8221;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very important that people come out and see other people&rsquo;s cultures and what they bring to Canada,&rdquo; Ms. Jawaid said.</p>
<p>And just WHY is it important for a previously clean orderly 95% White society to come out to celebrate their demise Jawaid?   Please show me an example of a peaceful clean orderly multi - cultural society. Trust me - the REAL Canadians know EXACTLY what they&rsquo;ve brought to Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Canada; its very nature is to be multi-ethnic and a very inclusive place.</p>
<p>What the heck does THAT mean! Who do these people think they are to come to Canada and proceed to tell the REAL Canadians what Canada is. And what&rsquo;s worse, the REAL Canadians are letting them do it. Of course, we&rsquo;re not much better. </p>

		<p>Let this Canadian try to convince the Chinese and Japanese that diversity is good, and they&rsquo;ll laugh right in her stupid face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why America is going down and those two countries are rising, especially China.</p>
<p>If America makes it through the next five years without a major internal conflict, America will forever be a third world, &#8220;Brazillian&#8221; society&hellip;.and so will Canada.</p>
<p>Homogeneity will rule the world and diversity will be forever filled with chaos and untold strife. </p>

<p><i>&ldquo;This is Canada; its very nature is to be multi-ethnic and a very inclusive place&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
This is simply not true. Canada is by its very nature a <i>bi-cultural</i> place: Western European (British and French mostly) and Indian (the Mohawk kind, not the South Asian kind interviewed in the article). For several hundred years it was very much <i>not</i> &#8220;multi-ethnic.&#8221; It wasn&rsquo;t particularly &#8220;inclusive&#8221; either: the French and the English continued to squabble long after the latter had decisively won possession of the place. And the Natives continued to be a problem for both English <i>and</i> French. It has only been the past 40 years, after the changing of the immigration laws, that Canada has stopped being one of the most <i>mono</i>-cultural countries on earth. </p>
<p>For the first decade-or-so of my life   &mdash;   and I ain&rsquo;t <i>that</i> old   &mdash;   there was nothing but Euros and a few Natives. No hispanics; no desis; no blacks; no Muslims; and only a tiny sprinkling of orientals in two or three cities. All this &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; is, for Canada, of very recent origin   &mdash;   yet is presented in this (and every other) newspaper as though it were a timeless, changeless, eternal, and unavoidable. As if it were as much of a fact-of-life for Canada as cold winters&hellip; </p>
<p>&hellip;And therefore beyond questioning or change. </p>

		<p>I predict that there WILL be a large race war in the U.S., and not so far off, either.  I believe the basis of it is more class than race, but, it will APPEAR as a race war because most of the really lower class people are black and/or mixed race black.  I am getting ready for it - my old Boy Scout motto is being lived out here and now.  I hope we can avoid this, but I don&rsquo;t really see how that&rsquo;s going to be possible.</p>

Right-O!

Which what?!?, makes me unworthy to live here?!?! Or I can`t love my family because they had no choice to take me in? </p>

<p>Let me help you with re-phrasing that statement to reflect in how most real Canadians feel about this empty multi-culti rhetoric that was thrust into our laps without permission, nor our approval.</p>
<p>This is Canada, but its nature is NOT to be multi-ethnic. Being &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; requires a degree of familial ties, not a hodge-podge  display of enforced diversity of people from 3rd world countries who offer us nothing we can&rsquo;t manage ourselves. Strangely, we once had perfectly working mono-culture that was so suitable to our needs, that it didn&rsquo;t need a label attached to it.</p>
<p>However, contemporary White Canadians, now, always seem to defer to visible-minorities in almost every fashion, lest we be accused as being &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Canadians have even appointed a Black Haitian immigrant to be our Governor-General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s very important that people come out and see other people&rsquo;s cultures and what they bring to Canada,&rdquo; Ms. Jawaid said.</i></p>
<p>Please enlighten me why its &#8220;very important&#8221;??  Does it raise Canada&rsquo;s standard of living or help to feed my family?  Or, is it important enough to place our own culture on the back burner to help you celebrate your foreign culture in <i>my</i> country? </p>
<p>And just what do other people&rsquo;s cultures &#8220;bring to Canada&#8221;? </p>
<p>Well, to begin with, <i>official</i> multiculturalism - costing billions of dollars, employment-equity (affirmative action), ESL costing mega-bucks, increased violent crime, a plethora of race-based group associations, ethnic politics, importation of foreign squabbles to our Canadian streets (Sri Lankans), racial profiling, etc. etc. and to top it off, &#8220;other people&rsquo;s cultures&#8221; bring needless, hand-wringing <i>white guilt</i> that did not exist just two generations ago.   </p>

		<p>I wonder how these South Asians would feel if their sub-continent were flooded with black Africans in the name of diversity. These Asians want Whites to share their own lands and prosperity with them but want their homelands made up 100% of Asians. Go to Karachi in Pakistan and you will only see Pakistanis (and a few descendants of black slaves who were freed by the British). Go to Bombay and you will see Indians everywhere. You may even come across local Marathi speakers of Bombay bashing up immigrants from other Indian states like  Bihar or Bangladesh. Go to Dhaka and you only see Bengalis. Where is the diversity here? Why is New Delhi, Colombo or Islamabad not filled with Vietnamese, Icelanders, Russians, Cherokee Native Americans, Peruvians, Germans, Moroccans, Mongols, Kenyans, Senegalese etc&hellip; in the name of diversity? 200 years from now all traces of White people will be wiped out. Just like the Ancient Egyptians we will leave behind our great monuments. The browns and blacks and even the Yellows probably will survive and live on for ever using technologies invented by Whites.</p>

		<p>As late as the late 1960&rsquo;s Canada was about 98% White. These &#8220;south Asian&#8221; people (&#8220;our&#8221; so-called &#8220;future&#8221;) didn&rsquo;t even exist in the country. Only Whites are supposed to cheerfully accept their dispossession and marginalization. Such madness!!</p>

<p>No, it won&rsquo;t be far off, it&rsquo;s on right now as we read about almost every day with blacks and hispanics attacking, raping and killing whites. But it will get much worse. If that is what you were trying to say, you were right.</p>

<p><br>
A lot of European countries aren&rsquo;t as tolerant as they appear either; people often cite China and Japan, but the reality is most &#8220;Old World&#8221; countries aren&rsquo;t that inclusive. Canada has a noticeable racist undercurrent (not as large as America&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s definitely there), however, both countries still market themselves as being completely tolerant.</p>
