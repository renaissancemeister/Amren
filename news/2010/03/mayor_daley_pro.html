			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, City of Chicago, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Mayor Richard M. Daley joins Manuel Rodriguez Arriaga, Mexican Consul General; Martin Castro, National Museum of Mexican Art Board Chair ; Deborah Rutter, Chicago Symphony Orchestra President and James Cuno, Art Institute of Chicago President during a reception at the Chicago Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington to kick off the 2010 Year of Mexico in Chicago celebrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Chicago, we celebrate the diversity of our neighborhoods and respect the culture and rich traditions of all of our residents,&#8221; said Mayor Daley. &#8220;The success of Mexicans in Chicago is the result of years of hard work, strong family values and dedication to community.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the reception Mayor Daley proclaimed 2010 to be the Year of Mexico in Chicago.</p>
<p>This year Mexico celebrates the Bicentennial of its independence and the Centennial of the Mexican Revolution  &mdash;  important turning points in Mexican history.</p>

<p>The second largest concentration of Mexicans in the United States is found in Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago and Mexico City have shared a valuable sister city relationship since 1991 and bilateral relations between Chicago and Mexico have continued to grow over the years.</p>
<p>Mayor Daley said, &#8220;Lets continue to work together to make Chicago a place of prosperity and opportunity for the Mexican community and all Chicagoans. I celebrate your success as a community and your dedication to family, work and culture.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One thing Daley left out   &mdash;   If it weren&rsquo;t for Chicago&rsquo;s world-famous uber-violent blacks, then everyone would be focused on all the Mexican (and other Hispanic) crime in the city, and the brutality of the Latin Kings.  Barrio Azteca, MS-13 and Mara 18 also have a presence there.</p>
<p>However, Daley&rsquo;s affinity toward his city&rsquo;s citizens/illegals of Mexican descent doesn&rsquo;t surprise me   &mdash;   The only reason he ever got to be Mayor, and topple what appeared in the 1980s to be a permanent and invincible black power structure, is because he was able to rally Chicago&rsquo;s non-blacks into a permanent voting bloc that votes in fear of blacks and their politicians.  </p>

		<p><i>The second largest concentration of Mexicans in the United States is found in Chicago.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to read this. I would have thought that &#8220;honor&#8221; would go to L.A.</p>
<p>Hispanic areas in Chicago (and elsewhere) certainly always look better than black areas. However, they often tend to have a rather seedy appearance that Polish, Italian and other such neighborhoods don&rsquo;t have. But then, that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;re not supposed to notice.</p>

		<p>Daley has formed a coalition for elections that includes Latinos. The fact that only one in ten Latinos is eligible to vote and only one in twenty actually votes is besides the point. The racial gerrymandering of election districts permitted by federal judges is appalling: a white majority ward that has 30,000 active voters can have one alderman in the city council while a Latino ward where less than 8,000 people vote is entitled to an alderman as well. The congressional map that created a district for Luis &#8220;Amnesty&#8221; Guitterez is an absolute joke.  </p>

		<p>Ah, yes, the Daley crime syndicate in Chicago reveals another side of its face. Actually, this isn&rsquo;t unique. For sheer A  &mdash;  kidding of hispanics, Daley will have to wait in line, because other Mayors have already beat him to it. For example, here in Los Angeles, we had a Mayor called James Hahn, who one year proclaimed that Los Angeles is a Mexican city. My father used to say that a politician is a person who, having been spit in his/her face, will wipe it off,smile,and say thank you. Incredibly, this type of politician has finally worn thin on millions of Americans. Why Daley keeps getting elected, I can&rsquo;t explain. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES.</p>

		<p>As a former resident of Chicago and a puerto rican, I find this article&hellip;..hilarious.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  Daley is a member of the mafia.  Everyone in Chicago knows this (anyone with any sense that is).  Criminals run the entire government top to bottom in Cook County.  Heck, an entire police force in Harvey Illinois was arrested recently as they weren&rsquo;t even pretending to do any police work anymore&hellip;.just selling drugs out of the cop cars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bad but how does it relate to this issue?  Let me explain.  During the election that went on, italian mobsters were roaming around spanish speaking neighborhoods, stopping people, telling them they were going to vote for Daley.  They made it pretty clear that it was&hellip;.&#8221;or else&#8221;.  I experienced this for myself one night, coming out after having dinner at (ironically enough), &#8220;The Puerto Rican Restaurant&#8221; (which doesn&rsquo;t even sell any ethnic puerto rican cuisine&hellip;.what a gyp).</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;.THAT is the relationship Daley has with spanish speaking people in Chicago. </p>

		<p>I not surprised that this was announced today. This is the 7th anniversary of the illegal destruction of Miegs field, the greatest crime in Chicago since the Valentine&rsquo;s day massacre.<br>
   His father was put in power by blacks and stayed in power by driving out lawbiding white catholics and replacing them with black proestants from the south.<br>
   Richard Michael used a different formula. He is driving out the whites by importing the mexicans. Since 1991 he has used every opportuninty to praise and help mexicans. They provide the city workers and the patronage workers. <br>
   Richard Michael destroyed Miegs field because white and black people used it. The simple mexican peasants could not. He wanted to use this field as a &#8220;Garden&#8221; so that mexican peasants can be given jobs that they can do.<br>
    What is this garden like now? I saw Judas Priest in concert there last summer! Some nature garden!<br>
   Hopefully Daley will kick off soon, he has a bad heart. Miegs will be rebuilt and mexicans driven from our city. A new age of peace and prosperity will begin.   </p>

		<p>Hey, someone help me out here.  I&rsquo;m hearing a lot about the immigrant population in Illinois, and I think the leader of the Hispanic caucus was from there, but how long have they been there and what drew them in?</p>
<p>Back in the &rsquo;80s I spent some time in Chicago and Schaumberg and I don&rsquo;t remember them being there in any significant number at the time.</p>
<p>Nevada is a seriously changed state over the past few years, and it was the housing boom that brought them in.  What did it for Illinois?</p>

		<p>Does one think there will be a Year of the United States of America in Mexico City?  And really, who cares?  These liberal thugs, like Mayor Daley, try to tell us what to believe and how to think:  We are all one great, happy, cohesive multicultural society.  The definition of hell would be to attend one of these culturally, enriching monstrosities: the screams of Viva La Mexico, Mexican flags fluttering in the wind, individuals wrapped in Mexican flags, leather toed boots so pointed that it would make a fencing foil envious, whiny and shrill music, maracas rattling, smelly individuals covered in tattoos wearing sleeveless undershirts, pamphlets being given and posted showing the southwestern states as part of Mexico, amnesty proclamations and leaflets talking about &ldquo;bad Whitey&rdquo;, White liberals vomiting platitudes about the greatness of the Mexican culture, etc.  What would any European American/European glean from attending such an event?                </p>

		<p>I fear this signals a tipping point in American politics, in which American pols, especially those so despicable as Mayor Daley, feel obligated to pander to their Hispanic constituents, and in the case of Obama, do all in their power to increase their numbers. </p>

		<p>There are lots of all-latino areas of NYC now.  I mean 20, 30 or more blocks of nothing but little Mexico, little Dominican Republic, etc..  I feel completely like a foreigner there.</p>
<p>I have found that for the most part, the South Americans are much more civilized out of them all.  I do get stared at, though, when I go to those places for my work duties, as I am probably the only blond white guy the people have seen there in a month!  (Who isn&rsquo;t a homeless bum or drug addict.  There always seems to be white bums everywhere.)</p>
