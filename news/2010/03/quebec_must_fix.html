<h1>Quebec Must Fix Its Lack of Diversity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ibbitson, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For proof that Quebec is headed for a demographic reckoning, you need only cross the Alexandra Bridge.</p>
<p>Ottawa and Gatineau are inseparable: bound by their history, their bridges and their shared role as national capital.</p>
<p>But while 19 per cent of Ottawa residents belong to a visible minority, according to a Statistics Canada report released this week, in Gatineau the figure is 6 per cent.</p>
<p>Lack of diversity means lack of immigrants; almost all of Canada&rsquo;s immigrants are visible minorities.</p>
<p>Because women throughout the developed world aren&rsquo;t having enough children to sustain their populations, places that don&rsquo;t attract immigrants must decline in the decades to come.</p>
<p>Quebec faces that decline.</p>
<p>The province is seized with a furor over a woman who has been expelled from language-training classes because she refuses to remove the veil that covers her face.</p>
<p>Integrating immigrants is a challenge everywhere in Canada, but it is a particular problem in Quebec, which is the least diverse of Canada&rsquo;s big provinces.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a divide between immigration policy and integration policy,&#8221; says Marie-Thérèse Chicha, an economist who specializes in immigration and diversity issues at the University of Montreal. The province, she says, encourages immigration, but then lacks the funding or policy coherence to help new arrivals integrate into the Quebec economy.</p>
<p>And chicken-becoming-egg, that economy then weakens, further deterring immigrants and making the province less and less diverse, compared to the country&rsquo;s major growth centres.</p>
<p>Analysts often refer to Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal as hubs of diversity. This is false. Montreal does not even begin to compare with Toronto and Vancouver, has fallen behind Calgary and is matched by Edmonton.</p>
<p>Forty-three per cent of Toronto&rsquo;s population was non-white in 2006; in Vancouver the figure was 42 per cent. In Calgary, the number was 22 per cent; in Edmonton, 17 per cent and in Montreal, 16 per cent. By 2031, people of European background will be a minority in both Toronto and Vancouver. Four in 10 Calgarians will be non-white. In Edmonton and Montreal, it will still be only three in 10.</p>
<p>Uniquely among provinces, Quebec is responsible for selecting its immigrants. Not surprisingly, the province places an emphasis on people who speak French and who are willing and able to integrate within the Quebec nation.</p>
<p>But more than half of all Canadian immigrants come from India, China or countries nearby. They are vastly more likely to know English, or to be willing to learn it, than French.</p>
<p>China and India boast vibrant if still developing economies. Many countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and other parts of the Third World where French is spoken are considerably poorer. Quebec&rsquo;s language policies deter immigrants from the most vibrant regions, while favouring some of the most impoverished places on Earth.</p>
<p>Outside the biggest cities, the situation in Quebec is particularly bleak, compared to elsewhere. Vancouver is bringing in large number of immigrants, but so is nearby Abbotsford. Even Victoria, that most English of Canadian cities, will be nearly 20 per cent &#8220;viz-min&#8221; by 2031. Visible minorities will make up between a quarter and a third of the populations of all the major cities in Southern Ontario, from Hamilton to Windsor.</p>
<p>But apart from Montreal, Quebec remains virtually devoid of new arrivals. Only 2 per cent of Quebec City&rsquo;s population was a visible minority in 2006; over 20 years, it will swell to 5 per cent. Saguenay will go from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. Sherbrooke will reach 10 per cent and Trois-Rivières, 4 per cent. These cities will all be dying, for lack of new arrivals.</p>
<p>The province has had some limited success in encouraging larger families through subsidies and government programs. But no developed country has succeeded in convincing women that they should have families large enough to make the population self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Quebec has successfully preserved its language and culture, despite enormous pressures. This is a remarkable achievement. Now Quebeckers must ask a very difficult question: How are they to preserve that language and culture while attracting sufficient immigrants who are willing and able to sustain it?</p>
<p>The survival of the French fact in North America hangs on the answer.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The survival of the French fact in North America hangs on the answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>French North America can no more survive without Frenchmen than can France.  The Haitians speak a version of French, but is Haiti culturally or ethnically French?  No, of course not.  Teach a Robin to sing like a Sparrow and what do you have?  A Robin doing an impersonation (probably bad) of a Sparrow.  But a Robin is not a Sparrow.  A dandelion is not a daisy.  A Collie is not a Dachshund.  Why can&rsquo;t people get this through their heads.</p>
<p>Now I have a question for all the race-replacement enthusiasts:  if you do not plan on bequeathing your society to your own kin, or your own tribesman, why do care if your &#8220;culture&#8221; survives?  Are you so racist that deep down in your heart you believe that Pakistani culture is inferior to say French-Quebec culture?  So you want the Pakistani&rsquo;s to adopt your culture and perpetuate it, something you yourselves are not willing to do.  Why should they?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t they just move in and bring their culture with them? If I buy a house should I be expected to keep your wallpaper?  Heck no!  I acquired the house fair and square and really do not care what kind of wallpaper YOU like, I want wallpaper that I like.  <br>

<p>The author is a phoney.  His pretend concern for the French language in his closing statement is a transparent lie.  </p>
<p>Everything else he&rsquo;s written beforehand belies his singular wish to see white homogeneity smashed. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Writer expects non-white immigrants to sustain Quebec&rsquo;s French heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilarious.  Really funny.</p>
<p>If I weren&rsquo;t well-versed on the naivete of radical leftists I would be amazed to learn that anybody could be so idiotic. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something just as funny:  Al Gore held a Hispanic up to the T.V. cameras and asked him what he thought when he saw the Statue of Liberty, as if the Statue of Liberty is on the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The Hispanic played along, pretending he was holding back tears. Hilarious.</p>

		<p>The multi-cultural brainwashing that permeates this article is beyond belief.  The theme is that for a region to survive it needs masses of third-world, non-white immigrants.  The author parrots this theme as if it was scientific fact akin to the Law of Gravity.  Of course, the author never mentions any downside to these policies.</p>
<p>Diversity (non-whites = good)<br>
Whites = bad</p>
<p>His most oxymoronic statements are at the end of the article.  Specifically, &#8220;How are they to preserve that language and culture while attracting sufficient immigrants who are willing and able to sustain it? &hellip; The survival of the French fact in North America hangs on the answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>So per his imbecilic logic one brings Indians, Chinese, and Muslims to a region to preserve French culture????  I perhaps have never read anything so stupid in my life!!!</p>

		<p>If my French were better, I might consider immigrating. Actually Quebec should be applauded for its lack of diversity. If they want more immigrants to solve a demographic problem, why not go to the &#8220;motherland&#8221; and encourage the French (the productive, educated, self-supporting ones) to come over. Being a Southerner, I would gladly send them a few hundred thousand Cajuns. Additionally they could slack off on their rather excessive language laws and more English speaking Canadians would move there.</p>

<p>From the (unbelievably stupid and reverse-racist) article:</p>
<p><br>
<i>China and India boast vibrant if still developing economies. Many countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and other parts of the Third World where French is spoken are considerably poorer. Quebec&rsquo;s language policies deter immigrants from the most vibrant regions, while favouring some of the most impoverished places on Earth.</i></p>
<p><br>
Please allow me to translate: English-speaking Canada is on the path to success because it&rsquo;s been importing colossal numbers of vibrant yellow and brown people who are good at business. French-speaking Canada, on the other hand, is courting disaster by importing French-speaking blacks from Haiti, Martinique and Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire&hellip; who are good at NOTHING. According to multiculti logic, however even these impoverished, crime-prone French-speaking blacks is still preferable to letting Quebec remain so hideously white. </p>

I&rsquo;ve said it before. French Canadians are more concerned about preserving their French language than they are in preserving their French culture and heritage. They would sell their soul to the devil just to preserve their language and to rub it in the face of English speaking Canada.</p>
<p>French speaking Moroccans or French speaking Jamaicans couldn&rsquo;t care less about preserving traditional French-Canadian culture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet Montreal has a huge graffiti problem caused by the new residents marking THEIR territory and defiling everything Montreal sees as their historic and cultural legacy.</p>

		<p>ALIENISTS MUST START BY PUTTING THEMSELVES UP FOR SALE FIRST?</p>
<p>I like to ask white alienists who want more immigration:  the dark skinned aliens find your white women very attractive and often desire to take them.  The vast majority of them would like to take away your job and your women  &mdash;  what is wrong with that?  They are seeking a better life, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>They think that you can easily find another beautiful white woman, beacause you are white.  They think that they can take away your house and your wealth, because, being white, you will earn them back easily.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?  Well, this is true!!</p>
<p>Now, if you mind all this, you can turn around and apologize for being an alienist and save your race and nation by banning immigration  &mdash;  the cancer of western nations.</p>
<p>But if you still do not mind, leave your doors wide open, never lock your door, post your address online and let all aliens know about your wealth and let everybody and anybody come in and help themselves to whatever and whoever they want. I am sure you will love this diversity.  And if you or your family are broke, poor, mugged, looted and beaten to near death after a few days  &mdash;  hey, that is the price for being a xenophiliac.  The aliens were just seeking a better life!!  And don&rsquo;t complain  &mdash;  because if you do, you are a racist.</p>
<p>Practice what you preach.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see how replacing themselves with Chinese and Indo-Pakistanis is going to &#8220;save&#8221; Quebec&rsquo;s French culture. Quite the opposite. I live here in Toronto where we are inundated by these people. Belive me I am not being &#8220;saved&#8221;. Replaced. Marginalized. Dispossessed. Definitely not &#8220;saved&#8221;.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of readers here not familiar with John Ibbitson and the Globe and Mail;</p>
<p>The Globe is a pretty liberal and left-wing newspaper. As for Ibbitson he is a full blown open-doors liberal. He has been calling for increases in immigration for years and is a 100% egalitarian diversity-loving shameless liberal. He just can&rsquo;t wait to see himself be turned into a minority in his own country. I will never understand this mindset. Never.</p>

		<p>What exactly is so TERRIBLE about population decline anyways? In WW1 Canada only had a population of 8 million. Canada created an army of 600,000 men. It fought bravely. In 1939 Canada only had a population of 11 million. Again Canada fought hard and acquitted itself well. What would be so catastrophic if over a period of time, Canada&rsquo;s population dropped from 33 to 30, 28 or even 25 million? The lowest number is still more then triple Canada&rsquo;s WW1 population. How ridiculous is this &#8220;demographic-canard&#8221; bull****? Sergio Marchi, one-time Canadian immigration minister (from the Liberal party naturally) used to say that he had to keep allowing high levels of immigration or Canadians would &#8220;dissapear&#8221; in 175 years!  Just try being a young family and buy a home in Asian-saturated Vancouver. House prices there are insane. Like gridlock? Then you&rsquo;ll love immigration. Try driving across Toronto some time. </p>

		<p><b>Because women throughout the developed world aren&rsquo;t having enough children to sustain their populations, places that don&rsquo;t attract immigrants must decline in the decades to come.</b></p>
<p>Birth rates rise and fall. The current drop is disturbing - why have so many First Worlders decided to stop having children? - but it need only be a blip. But if we try to fill in the temporary buirth gap by flooding our countries with minorities that look nothing like us and that, in so many cases, openly despise us, we&rsquo;ll lose our countries forever all thanks to that blip.</p>

		<p>My God, how can people be this illogical? It is borderline insanity. </p>
<p>After all, we see how well European immigrants maintained the traditions of the native tribes already in the New World, right? People bring their own cultures with them. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they? Why are the lefties so desperate to take Asian culture away from Asians or Caribbean culture away from Caribbean blacks? If you want to preserve a culture, you just do not allow people to enter who will replace that culture. It&rsquo;s very simple. The Japanese understand this; why can&rsquo;t the West?</p>
<p>Hopefully, Quebec can sustain current trends. If so, it will remain a nice, successful place to live while the rest of Canada descends to Third World status.</p>

<p>Wow, did Quebec finally win independence from Canada?</p>
<p>Quebec is a great example of how &#8220;diversity&#8221; can tear a nation apart. Their culture being mostly French derived, rather than English, like the rest of (native, white) Canada, they don&rsquo;t seem to have much loyalty to their brother and sister Canadians outside of their little ethnic enclave.</p>

		<p>I hate these white liberals that always point to some generational ponzi scheme as the reason for immigration. </p>
<p>These are the same clowns that told us 35 years ago that the world needed to control its population bomb  (and that the world was becoming colder due to air pollution). Now, we who controlled our populations must seek savior laborers from the 3rd world countries.I wonder what he will say when he is old and in the care of a majority minority population.Do he think they are going to tenderly care for him in his old infirmed age?<br>
No, he will be nothing but an old fool to be done away with as the diferent minorities start vying for power. </p>

		<p>Accepting Haitian immigrants will not be a good option for Quebec. The creole spoken in Haiti is but loosely based on French and is incomprehensible, in either its spoken or written form, to a French speaker.<br>
Furthermore, most Haitians in the U.S. are on welfare. It&rsquo;s likely that they will be just as much a drain on the taxpayer in Quebec.</p>

		<p>French Quebec&hellip;</p>
<p>Their organized history goes all the way back to the mid eighteenth century with the onset of the French &amp; Indian War.</p>
<p>These Frenchman were originally trappers, hunters, traders and explorers two hundred and fifty years ago. Even today, much of the province still remains a wild place and many rural folks still have these traditions running through their veins.</p>
<p> Third world, non- white Haitian, Jamaican, Muslim or whatever else &#8220;do not&#8221; fit in, belong or share in Quebec&rsquo;s historical developement or their customs. Therefore they have no right to &#8220;physically&#8221; live there. </p>
<p>Quebec should be proud of their lack of racial and ethnic diversity in this day and age, but instead draws criticism. </p>
<p>Instead of importing third worlders why can&rsquo;t this province just except and adjust for lower birth rates? Or study the cause and effect and implement solutions to counter these trends? </p>
<p>Engaging in population replacement of it&rsquo;s own native French white population is about the dumbest and most contemptable thing they can do.</p>
<p> Wisdom might prevail for Quebec&rsquo;s future because of their strong ethnic and cultural ties, but I won&rsquo;t hold my breath. </p>

		<p>  I am entirely unaware if this note will be posted, as an new series of news articles will shortly be put up, by or, sometime afte,  5: 30 Pm. However,  in response to this utterly wretched piece of journalism,  I believe that I must write «something» in response.</p>
<p>  In the first instance,  the «author» a typical «kanadian» left of center newspaper hack,  asserts, and assumes, or,  assumes, as an assertion, that, in order to preserve an culture, an society, and an civilization,  one may merely «substitute» (in fact, «displace»), one population with another. </p>
<p>  Even a brief and cursory review of the historical record exposes as fact, that this facile, intellectually lazy,  «this therefore that» assumption is utterly lacking in foundation.</p>
<p>  Before AD 55,  the population of the Island of Britain, was predominantly Celtic,  in language,  culture, religion, and social structure.  Then,  the Romans arrived. And, after several protracted and extremely violant «trials of conclusions» in the matter,  the country «settled» down, and became a Roman province.</p>
<p>  However,  «provincia britannia» was a very different place, in, let us say,  AD 150, than it had been in 55 AD. An new culture, society, language and civilization had displaced, absolutely, the antecedent Celtic civilisation that had preceded it. And the Celtic civilisation that had existed prior to the arrival of Rome, never recovered.</p>
<p>  Several centuries on,  another cycle of population displacement occurred;  as Angles, Saxon,  Jutes and Danes began to arrive - unannounced, and, certainly, uninvited. And, again, after several centuries (centuries), of violent discussion in the matter, (the historical record of which (bones, armor, and «slighted» fortifications, survives down to our time), the island settled down again. But, (but), not as an Roman province, nor even as an sub - Roman independant principality; «Britannia» had become «Anglaterra» - «Angleland,» «England».</p>
<p>  This time, however,  things were different,  the barbarians were evangelized - at great cost - by Irish monks from «Hibernia,» and,  an «Anglo - Saxon» «civilisation» was created, at least in nascent form. Expressed by, among others, an bookish monk and an shy cowherd in north east «Anglia,» Bede and Caedemon.  Bede wrote in Latin, very good Latin, his bishop wrote an even better Latin hand, elaborating great tracts of church documents praising the beauty of viginity. But,  (but), beyond the walls of their monastery, at Jarrow,  and even within it, Roman civilisation had perished. For good.</p>
<p>  When we examine events in North Africa,  the contrast, in terms of the substitution of one population for another, upon the bland and banal assumption that «things will go on as before» is simply false. If the mere substitution of one people for another is sufficient to «keep a civilisation going» than, why is it that, an portion of the North African shore,  the population of which,  circa AD 642 was Christian, European, who spoke Latin, and were part of the «greater whole» of European Civilisation around the Mediterreanean («Romania»), is now,  circa 1500 years later populated by persons who are Arab and Semitic,  whose language is Arabic, and whose culture, society and civilisation is Islamic, and whose religion is Muslim? In other words,  why and how did «Africa Proconsularis,» as it was known circa AD 642, become the present day «Republic of Tunisia»?</p>
<p>  Anyone who believes that, merely by substituting one people for another, indifferently,  has absolutely no effect upon the culture, society and civilisation that exists at the time at which «substitution» (otherwise : «population displacement»), occurs,  is either profoundly intellectually lazy,  or fundamentally intellectually dishonest. Or both. </p>
<p>  Anyone who believes that the solution to the question of the survival of Québec culture and society is the importation of large numbers of Pakistanis,  Lebanese, (either Christian or Muslim), sub - Saharan Africans or even South American Hispanics,  is entirely out of touch with reality. When we import large numbers of these people, we import their language,  their culture, the civilisation and their religion. Which will inevitably, grate against and erode our own. It has happened before, the matter is beyond debate. The «ticket» to cultural genocide is a sutcase, and an entry visa. Professor Auster&rsquo;s excellent essay : «The Path to National Suicide : An Essay on Immigration and Multiculturalism in America,»  makes this abundantly clear. «Beyond all Reasonable Doubt.»</p>

		<p>The only reason that any nation needs a larger population at a time when the world population has become dangerously over large and promises of huge disasters loom as more and more bodies arrive is because capitalism requires them for economic growth.  The state requires them for taxes, etc., but the state could easily adjust itself to lower population needs.  The Catch-22 is that if white Canadians and other whites in Western nations want to sustain their lifestyles they have to build it on immigrants, or else roll-up their sleeves and do the menial tasks themselves.</p>
<p>What I see is laziness on all fronts.  This laziness will end up costing everyone what they have.  The bright side of that is that it will hit the third world harder at first, but it has hit us and will hit us again, and again, and with increasing force.  If Greece for example, is allowed to fail economically, it could take down the Euro.  If that currency fails, the domino effect will plunge us all into a worse recession than the one we are barely recovered from.  Greece is trying to talk the G-8 nations into establishing rules for international business because investors are actually making money by betting on a possible failure of Greece.  Greece has increased taxes and cut down on expenditures.  That has resulting in riots in the past few days.</p>
<p>Look for the best, but plan for the worst.</p>

		<p>Wow. Quebec city 98% white in 2006! Quebec Province sounds like paradise! I don&rsquo;t know what this guy&rsquo;s problem is, the ethnic situation in Quebec sounds absolutely perfect to me: not too little, not too much. Instead of whining about there not being enough minorities in Quebec, why doesen&rsquo;t he write an article on how to encourage the French population to increase their birth-rates? I think I know the answer, because he a white-hating liberal multiculturalist. As if multiculturalism will help Quebec retain its French identity. That is, quite obviously, the oposite of what it will do.</p>
<p>&#8220;China and India boast vibrant if still developing economies. Many countries in the Caribbean, northern Africa and other parts of the Third World where French is spoken are considerably poorer. Quebec&rsquo;s language policies deter immigrants from the most vibrant regions, while favouring some of the most impoverished places on Earth.&#8221;<br>
Let&rsquo;s see, I can think of a French-speaking country that is far wealthier than either India or China: France!</p>

		<p> &#8220;Hopefully, Quebec can sustain current trends. If so, it will remain a nice, successful place to live while the rest of Canada descends to Third World status.&#8221;    &mdash;   G. Verdi<br>
**************<br>
Maybe that&rsquo;s one reason why they&rsquo;re so determined to get Quebec diversified.  They don&rsquo;t want it to furnish an example to the rest&hellip;an example the others might be tempted to follow when they wake up and realize their own terrible mistake and how they&rsquo;ve been deceived. <br>

Self-hatred. Ibbitson is a fullblown capital-L liberal. He should really be a writer for the Toronto Star (the most liberal, left-wing socialist newspaper in Canada). He is a complete multicult-diversicrat egalitarian. Always writing pro-immigration articles (just so long as the immigrants aren&rsquo;t White or from Europe). The way he spins it you would think Canada would collapse into the apocalypse if immigration was shut off for one single day. He is such a sad example of Canadian journalism.</p>

		<p>The fact that white people the world over have in general generated less children in recent times than in the past is not all attributable to negligence or hedonism. We have survived major ups and downs&hellip; whether plagues, famines or war. I think we can survive this difficulty as well without selling our genetic soul for a pot of miscegenated pottage. Much of the change is an effort to focus on quality over quantity..something most whites of the past hadn&rsquo;t the luxury to consider. Lastly a man in a dress is no more a woman than a non white is a representation of white culture. Whether the French or any other whites in Canada chose to procreate or miscegenate is up to them.. but an apple is not an orange.</p>
