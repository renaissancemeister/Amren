			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, The Hastings Center, March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>(Garrison, NY) Many egg donation agencies and private couples routinely exceed compensation recommendation limits for potential donors, a new study finds.</p>
<p>From a sample of over 300 college newspapers, findings revealed that almost one-quarter of advertisements offered payment in excess of $10,000, a violation of guidelines issued by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).</p>
<p>Compensation strongly correlated with average SAT score of the university&rsquo;s students, according to the study published in The Hastings Center Report by researcher Aaron D. Levine, of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In addition, approximately one-quarter of the advertisements listed specific requirements for potential donors, such as appearance or ethnicity. This also goes against ASRM guidelines, which prohibit linking compensation to donor personal characteristics.</p>
<p>Holding all else equal, such as demand for in vitro fertilization within a state and donor agency variables, Levine found that each increase of 100 SAT points in the average for a university increased the compensation offered to egg donors at that school by $2,350.</p>
<p>Of the advertisements violating ASRM guidelines, many offered $20,000, several offered $35,000, and one was as high as $50,000. Current ASRM guidelines recommend that sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate.</p>
<p>The extent to which compensation limits are appropriate remains an open question, says Levine, but industry steps to self-regulate could alleviate concerns about exploitation. Monetary thresholds may be valuable if these limits protect a substantial number of potential donors from undue pressure to donate. Levine suggests verifying donor agency compliance (which is currently self-reported) or changing the format of advertisements.</p>
<p>In a related commentary, John A. Robertson, of the University of Texas, argues against greater regulation, and calls the current guidelines into question themselves. &#8220;After all, we allow individuals to choose their mates and sperm donors on the basis of such characteristics,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;Why not choose egg donors similarly?&#8221; </p>

		<p>The whole idea of limiting the compensation one can receive for an egg donation, or restricting the criteria upon which offers can be made is ridiculous. </p>
<p>While this comes a bit too close to &#8220;baby selling&#8221; for my taste, the fact is that it&rsquo;s legal commerce, in which case the market should set its own price.</p>

		<p>1) You pay for quality.<br>
2) It is a rather unpleasant experience to harvest eggs, much easier to get sperm, another reason for the price differential.<br>
3) It isn&rsquo;t anywhere close to baby selling, an ovum is an unfertilized egg and woman naturally disgard dozens of them during their child bearing years.<br>
4) Anything for more white babies.<br>
5) Freedom of Choice!  If it is ok (not by me) to kill an unborn child for the heck of it why should there be a restriction on a woman who helps and infertile couple have a baby?</p>

		<p>Women should be aware that egg donation is a much different thing from sperm donation. Women only have so many eggs to last a lifetime. And one of the ways those clinics harvest eggs is by giving the donors chemicals to stimulate the maturity and release of additional eggs. When these women are infertile and can&rsquo;t have children they&rsquo;ll think $10K wasn&rsquo;t such a good deal after all.</p>

		<p>SAT scores are linked to IQ.<br>
IQ is linked to genetics.<br>
High SAT scores are generally linked with prestigious universities.  </p>
<p>This is just common sense.  Of course egg donation agencies will pay more for donors from better universities.  To try to stop this makes no sense.</p>
<p>In fact, they should just cut to the chase and allow the agency to test for IQ, advertise for specific ethnicity, and note physical appearance and criminal records because in the end that is what the recipient is concerned with.</p>

		<p>They need to let the free market do its thing.  If there is a high enough payment, more women with &#8220;desirable qualities&#8221; will offer their eggs for sale, bringing down the demand, and with it, the price.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how many of these eggs will actually be used to help White couples have White children and how many will be used to bleach the offspring of couples in non-White countries where lighter skin and Occidental features are prized.</p>
<p>The reason I am curious is because I know of a few Black women who have gone out of their way to buy sperm sold by the lightest of White men (blue-eyed blond Nordics) with the highest IQs they can find.  They said they wanted &#8220;brighter&#8221; babies.  Unsure if they were talking about the skin color or intelligence.</p>
<p>I am also wondering if this is the next logical step for TPTB to take considering the reluctance of most White people to engage in miscegenation with other races.  After all, TPTB want serfs who are not as violent as blacks and Mestizos and Arabs, but not as intelligent as Whites.  So, I could see them encouraging fecund young White people to donate their ova and sperm for &#8220;research&#8221; only to unwittingly propagate mixed race children.</p>

		<p>No different from organ harvesting. One of my friends was killed in a car crash due to head injuries, he was an organ donor and very healthy. He was almost immediatly &#8220;harvested&#8221; parts went all over the country (NOT FOR FREE BTW) and in the end, my friend&rsquo;s wife was stuck with a $6,000 hospital bill for services required to keep the organs fresh before being harvested and it was only for not more that 2 days!</p>

		<p>Often, the free market is the best way to determine the truth. If we are all &#8220;equal,&#8221; if IQ is &#8220;not inherited&#8221; - then why is there such a price differential? </p>

		<p>No junior I&rsquo;m not really your father, and no your mommy is not really your mommy. But to prove we care about you, we gave a gazillion dollars for the sperm we had put in those test tubes, to incubate you, and the doctor chose the best one to make you, and threw the rest in the trash. Therefore any feelings of inferiority, or an identity crisis on your part are totally unfounded. We really care for you, and know you will be really bright, and that,s why we call you Son. SIC! </p>

		<p>Those who pay lots of dollars for sperm in order to be artificially inseminated do not seem confused at all about the<br>
likelihood that genes contribute lots to a child&rsquo;s IQ and major personality traits.  They expect information about these traits of the anonymous donor and firms providing sperm anticipate and accommodate this interest without being asked to.    </p>

		<p>A willing buyer and a willing seller, sounds like Free Market economics and good business practice to me  &mdash;  and no one is getting hurt.  The regulators need to get out of the way and let the market take care of itself. </p>
<p>BUT the government can&rsquo;t have that!  Markets MUST be regulated!  All of them!  It&rsquo;s to &#8216;protect the people&rsquo; and because we&rsquo;re all equal, (some more than others, of course) no one can be allowed to get ahead or anyone else!  Egg recipients must be color blind, the donor selection random (except for the hostile elites, of course, who want to preserve their bloodlines and IQ differentials).  You must be willing to accept an eggs at random or you will not receive any!</p>
<p>Harry Browne once noted that if the computer industry were in the hands of the government, computers would still be the size of city blocks.  Instead, due to a Free Market  they became smaller, faster, more powerful, more user-friendly and cheaper (cell phones would still be &#8216;bricks&rsquo; if in the government&rsquo;s hands costing thousands of dollars).  </p>
<p>And Thank God for those computers produced by the Free Market!  It has opened up an entirely new world for us, allowed us to connect with others who feel the same way we do (and not the mind-numbed, disgruntled robots living in trailer parks marching in lock-step to Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s commands, as the media portrays us).</p>
<p>Professor Rummel writes this about the old Soviet economy:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Party strictly limited the use of computers, all of which it owned. For over a decade it kept computers under lock and key and they could be used only with Party permission. &hellip;all private businesses were illegal, there could be no Microsoft to design personal computers or write software. Such could only be done within some Party-run shop. If in such a shop a Gates had written useful software, it would be the property of the Party, to dispose of as the Party bureaucracy wished&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where the US is headed as obama&rsquo;s administration take over the US economy.</p>
<p>Funny isn&rsquo;t is, that the intelligentsia in the universities (and government, and academia, and the media) continue to push the egalitarian notion (and push hard) that people are products of their environment, heredity has nothing to do with intelligence, it is not passed on genetically and that &#8216;we all have the same potential&rsquo;  &mdash;  that low black and and hispanic achievement is due &#8216;strictly to the environment they&rsquo;re in&rsquo; and that if their environment were improved (school, home, neighborhood) they would then reach their potential to be anything they dreamed of being  &mdash;    rocket scientists, nuclear physicists, mechanical engineers.</p>
<p>Seems regular people well understand that SAT is not just a test that &#8216;measures test-taking skills&rsquo; (as I&rsquo;ve heard repeatedly in teacher professional developments, usually put on by a black with a Ph.D in education), that IQ IS mostly genetic despite what the late Gould and (not late) Wise proport  &mdash;  and are given unlimited media time to expose their views and accolades for pushing the false Boasian axiom that &#8216;we are all the same with the same potential!&rsquo; and &#8216;race is a social construct&rsquo; (I swear if I hear that one more time I&rsquo;m going to go postal!).</p>
<p>This, while hereditarians, such as Professors Rushton and Jensen, with plenty of evidence to present the results of their life-long research that IQ is mostly a product of hereditary and not environment,  are reviled, denigrated, mocked, attacked physically and prevented from speaking.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the situation in other countries is?  <br>
Doubtless, given the large number of sovereign countries and governments in the world (unless there is some international convention to control this &#8220;traffic&#8221;), there must be numerous cracks and loopholes available for anyone to get around these stifling restrictions, if someone wishes to go abroad for the procedure.  There will always be someplace you can have it done.</p>

<p>Agreed.  It calls to mind the futuristic scenario in the tv series &#8220;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#8221; where regulations were put in place prohibiting synthetic human genetic recoding (supposedly a viable technology by that time).  The reason?  Fear of creating another &#8220;Khan Noonien Singh&#8221; (i.e. a mentally and physically superior human).</p>
<p><a href="https://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh" rel="nofollow">https://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Khan_Noonien_Singh</a></p>
<p>The laughable thing is, no one in the biosciences seriously believes such prohibitions will ever be put in place (if such a technology is ever actually created).  If the neo-Marxist forces of the Obamanation do manage to cobble together some kind of restrictions, those with the money and the resolve will simply skirt them, as the above article amply illustrates.  The inevitable result will be a further widening in the genetic gulf between the haves and the have-nots.</p>

		<p>In reality, current ASRM guidelines are such that they really do not recommend that you use in vitro fertilization because either you or your wife are too old to raise a child.  To pretend that the medical establishment is not wholly dead set against such a practice they make it so that you must pass a psychiatrists test to indemnify the in vitro clinic in the event you and spouse are mentally unstable.</p>
<p>So while you and wife may have located a suitable oocyte donor you, she and her must all pass the mental stability test, given by a psychiatrist if you can find one at a cost of about $1000 for all three before the clinic will officially get involved.  I spoke with over fifteen psychiatrists  before I found one that would do it.  As an aside, you should hear the recording of one of the preliminary conversations with a female psychiatrists who turned me down because her organization, ASRM, really does not approve of in vitro.</p>
<p>But lets pretend that you are the purchaser of one $10,000 oocyte cycle, and have engaged the services of an in-vitro clinic to conduct the retrieval, mix the components, watch the embryo development, select the most probable viable, time the implant, and make the implant at an additional cost of $10,000.  </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m sorry folks but all of this sounds like something out of &#8220;The Twilight Zone!&#8221;  People should not be selling their genetic material to make babies. It is a dehumanization of what it is to be a person and playing God.  There are bound to be very popular donors of eggs and sperm resulting in half-sibling couplings. Imagine the Oedipal-like consequences and genetic mishaps. Selling ova and sperm is just sleazy. </p>

		<p>By their late 20&rsquo;s one in six women are infertile, and by their mid-30&rsquo;s almost one in four are infertile. By age 40, three in five are infertile and by age 43 it would be a rare woman who is still fertile. In total that&rsquo;s a lot of White women who want to have children but can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As long as they don&rsquo;t pass on the genes that cause the infertility I personally believe they should be able to have a child otherwise her and her partner will die without children, adding to the population decline that plagues our people. If they then go and select children with intellectual ability isn&rsquo;t that an added bonus? We will need more intelligent Whites in the not too distant future if we want to survive, as advanced technology won&rsquo;t fix itself and requires intellectual ability to understand how it works.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Beaumont,  back when people lived in tiny villages of just a couple hundred people (only a few generations ago), or as serfs on a feudal estate which they never left, or even further back when people lived in a small tribal units, or even when they were cavemen (and women),  whom do you think they were marrying and reproducing with?  The people who were available!</p>
<p>Whom did the Egyptian pharaoahs marry?  Their brothers and sisters, so as not to dilute the royal blood). Did you know that Cleopatra was the product of something like  nine generations of such marriages? It didn&rsquo;t hurt her, physically or mentally. She was known for her intellect and beauty.</p>
<p><br>
Whom have European monarchs traditionally married? OTHER members of royalty, generally. Or at least persons from the high nobility. Their choices were often very limited. They are/were ALL inter-related, going back for many, many generations, for a thousand years and more. ALL! The various European royal families are in reality just national branches of THE single European Royal Family. (There have been some hereditary diseases and some idiots, but some geniuses as well, as can happen in any family. In all, they have functioned quite successfully and are still on their thrones.)</p>
<p>To this day, in a swath of countries from Egypt to Pakistan, cousin marriage is extremely common&hellip;to the point that is just customary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending it, but the fact is that inbred marriages (while not ideally advisable) are not necessarily that deleterious either.  Otherwise, those societies that practice it would be walking basket cases by now,  or would have ceased to exist entirely. But that is not the case.</p>

		<p>I think the the main factor in the growing trend of sperm and egg donation is because a lot of White couples delay having children into their thirties or forties. Also, sexually degenerant lifestyles can induce infertility.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of sick. A woman that that&rsquo;s pregnant by a guy&rsquo;s sperm whom she has never even met? Yuck. <br>
And a husband&rsquo;s sperm to fertilize and egg that&rsquo;s from some anonymous woman? Sick</p>
<p>Both ways I think it&rsquo;s a form of infidelity. And I think it&rsquo;s a way of playing God, which I think is wrong. </p>
<p>50-100 years ago infertility was very very uncommon. Instead of &#8220;selling sperm and ova&#8221; and choosing the genes of your child, perhaps they should do research on what has caused a lot more White couples to face infertility.</p>
