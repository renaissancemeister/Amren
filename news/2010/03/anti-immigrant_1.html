<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/30/italy-elections-far-right-berlusconi">Anti-Immigrant Support Rises as Italian Far Right Makes Big Gains in Poll</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hooper, Guardian (London), March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Final results from Italy&rsquo;s regional and local elections have confirmed a surge in support for the anti-immigrant right, mirroring similar gains recently seen in the Netherlands and France.</p>
<p>With Silvio Berlusconi and his allies taking four regional governorships from the left, Umberto Bossi&rsquo;s Northern League has emerged as the undisputed winner. The League was expected to take 13% of the national vote, up from 8% at the last general election in 2008 when it used a poster of white sheep kicking out a black one.</p>
<p>Bossi&rsquo;s party won two important governorships  &mdash;  Piedmont, the region around Turin, and the Veneto. In the Veneto it received a 10% higher share than the prime minister&rsquo;s Freedom People movement.</p>
<p>The League also continued its expansion into areas outside its Po valley homeland. In &#8220;red&#8221; Emilia-Romagna  it won almost 14%.</p>
<p>The party&rsquo;s success fitted an emerging pattern. Earlier this month the Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, who has compared the Qur&rsquo;an to Hitler&rsquo;s Mein Kampf, made big gains in local elections. In France Jean-Marie Le Pen&rsquo;s National Front won nearly 10% of the vote in regional ballots.</p>
<p>The League&rsquo;s platform in the campaign leading up to the Italian poll on Sunday and Monday was less overtly racist than the NF&rsquo;s or that of Wilders&rsquo; Party for Freedom. But Bossi&rsquo;s party is in government and, with control of the interior ministry, it has been able to implement many of the policies it sought to introduce, including the turning back of would-be clandestine immigrants at sea and the setting up of &#8220;centres for identification and expulsion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Welcoming the results, Bossi called his party &#8220;unchained&#8221;. He gave a hint of what that could mean when he clashed with another minister, loyal to Berlusconi, after declaring that he wanted a Leaguer to be the next mayor of Milan. There was another spat after Berlusconi&rsquo;s public sector minister, Renato Brunetta, was defeated in a bid to become mayor of Venice. He said &#8220;friendly fire&#8221; from Bossi&rsquo;s followers had brought him to grief.</p>
<p>In the main election the governorships of 13 of the country&rsquo;s 20 regions were up for grabs. Six went to the right and seven to the left  &mdash;  a relative victory for Berlusconi, who entered the campaign handicapped by the economic crisis and the rank incompetence of his own officials who failed to submit on time the list of his party&rsquo;s candidates in the key region of Lazio.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, who controls a daily newspaper, a weekly news magazine and three television channels, said he had survived a &#8220;terrible campaign of slander and defamation&#8221;. He added: &#8220;Once again, love has conquered envy and hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the result would enable his government to enact &#8220;the reforms necessary for the modernisation and development of our country&#8221;. The reform at the top of his agenda before the poll was an overhaul of the judiciary intended to draw the claws of the prosecutors who have been trying to put him in jail for more than 20 years.<br>

		<p>Just for the sake of accuracy, or rather, to respond to the deliberate distortion of this writer, (The Guardian is hyper-left, after all), Le Pen&rsquo;s FN got something like 17.5% of the vote in regional elections a few weeks ago, which was good for third place.  This means that Sarkozy&rsquo;s deceptive attempt to co-opt FN issues and voters, which was successful in 2007, has been beaten three years later.    </p>

		<p>The Northern League (Lega Nord) is not a nationalist party but rather a regionalist, Po Valley-based party.<br>
It has two main themes - anti-multiculturalism, and decentralization (with the theoretical ultimate aim of independence of the Po Valley area - or rather, as they call it, &#8220;Padania&#8221;).</p>
<p>The sense of national identity is weak this country, in part because the country itself began to exist only in the late 19th century. Ironically the idea of &#8220;Italy&#8221; is stronger among Italo-Americans, who also have a lot of common traits since they mostly come from the same Sicilian-Neapolitan area. But in Italy, people are generally more loyal to their own home city or region.  The Northern League is openly anti-Italian unification, and recognizes/celebrates the different regional identities even within &#8220;Padania&#8221;. So the League is not only not nationalist, it is anti-nationalist.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the gains of the League is that it&rsquo;s beginning to spread outside the Po Valley area. I&rsquo;m not talking about the Emilia Romagna region, which contrary to what the Guardian article says, IS part of the Po Valley, both geographically and according to the League&rsquo;s own definition of &#8220;Padania&#8221;. But in these elections the League received some significant support even in Tuscany, which is not one of the regions that would be part of the League&rsquo;s independent &#8220;Padania&#8221;. </p>
<p>I think the problem with the US is the first-pass-the-post system, which makes it impossible for minority views to get political representation, so  those views can be marginalized. The presence of a (roughly) 10% Northern League in Italy&rsquo;s proportional representation system means that open anti-multiculturalism is part of the mainstream political discourse. Criticism of diversity is no taboo. This country has many flaws but episodes such as the killing of the AmRen conference are unthinkable over here - what Jared Taylor says about diversity is not so different from what the League says.</p>
<p>Besides, the League is in the Parliament and in the governing coalition so it already influences Italian policy decisions (as the Guardian article notes).</p>
<p>Changing the subject - as a supporter of Italy&rsquo;s broad right-wing coalition I feel a duty to defend Berlusconi from the usual slander he gets from he foreign left-wing media.</p>
<p>First - it is not true that Berlusconi controls a great part of the Italian media. He owns less than half of the tv channels (even when measured by audience), and only a very small part of the printed press. Most importantly, his channel aren&rsquo;t as politicized as, say, Fox News. Berlusconi&rsquo;s control of his own channel is very indirect and &#8220;spotty&#8221;. In fact, there are several left-wing satyrical shows on these supposedly &#8220;right-wing&#8221; channels, such as Le Iene, whose preferential target for mockery is of course, the Right.</p>
<p>It is the Left that controls the overwhelming majority of Italy&rsquo;s media, including the State television - which naturally remains on the Left even if Berlusconi is in power - and most of the printed press and the movie industry. Even Murdoch&rsquo;s own Italian satellite channels follow the anti-Berlusconi flow.</p>
<p>It is only non-Italian journalists (and in Italy, lefty lunatics with no relation with reality) who say that Italian democracy is in trouble because the Right controls all of the media. The mainstream left in Italy never says this - if they did, people would laugh because everybody with a Tv set can see that this is not the case. What the Left says about Berlusconi being a media mogul is different - they argue that since Berlusconi owns big companies, he should not govern because he may then favor his own companies. That would be a sensible point if not for the fact that all political parties have strong ties to this or that corporation. The Left for instance, has a historic privileged relationship with Fiat.</p>
<p>As for Berlusconi&rsquo;s supposed corruption. I don&rsquo;t have the time now to prove to you that he is the being unfairly persecuted by left-wing prosecutors. Just consider the following: there is a lot of corruption going around in Italy (though immensely less so than in Russia) and the highly politicized prosecution system is not immune from such corruption. So when you hear that some Italian political figure is being prosecuted, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he is corrupt - or even that there are good reasons to suspect him - it only means that there is a clash between two powers, either of which may be doing the devil&rsquo;s work.</p>

		<p>This is good news for Europe.  I sure wish an anti-immigration party could gain traction in the United States.  I find it interesting how a party can be left wing in any number of positions but if it&rsquo;s against massive levels of immigration it&rsquo;s suddenly &#8220;far right&#8221;.  A party that is pro-environment, pro-labor, and supportive of government provided, taxpayer funded social services but is also against immigration will automatically get that coveted &#8220;far right&#8221; label.  Thus the rather socialist BNP is &#8220;far right&#8221;.</p>

<p>It is getting so that the slur-word &#8220;racist&#8221; is applied to ANYTHING that the Left wants to demonize and isolate from respectable debate.  But this is not honest journalism!</p>

<p>&#8220;Would-be clandestine immigants at sea&#8221;&hellip;  Huh???<br>
I can think of a much simpler term: <b><i> invaders! </i></b> Just one simple word instead of six fancy ones.  </p>
<p>The Guardian has no need to waste so much excess verbiage and newsprint (on obvious obfuscation). Think of all the trees that must die for this!</p>
<p>Come now, Guardian, why is it so hard to say?  Unwelcome people who enter your country clandestinely, ininvited, unwanted, and illegally are called &#8220;invaders&#8221;.   It&rsquo;s a simple word; you journalists really should try to learn it.</p>

<p>Another possible obfuscation. Is he playing this down?  &#8220;Rome&#8221; would ring a bell much more clearly for most non-Italians.  For those who may not know, Lazio (Latium in English, the home of the original &#8220;Latini&#8221; or Latins) means Rome and the region around it. In other words, the capitol. It is not, as might be inferred, some remote province.  Why not just say &#8220;Rome and its region&#8221;, instead of Lazio which most foreigners would not recognize as having any special importance?<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re operating under the misconception the forces of the Left are relying on logic to get their points across.  Logic and critical thinking would be the death of the Left and leftists know it.  This is why they rely heavily on sensationalism and ad hominem argumentum attacks on anyone who dares oppose them.  Sadly, this strategy has always been highly effective.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is France&rsquo;s National Front &ldquo;racist&rdquo; when it holds simply that France should be for the French?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism" rel="nofollow">https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism</a></p>
<p>racism (n.) - a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one&rsquo;s own race is superior and has the right to rule others. </p>
<p>By that definition, the National Front is in fact &#8220;racist&#8221;.  However, unlike the vast majority of Whites (racially conscious ones, too, I might add) who are always trying to &#8220;prove&#8221; to others they are not &#8216;racist&rsquo;, I have never seen anything inherently wrong with the above definition.  Racism, like any other social philosophy, can either be used or misused.</p>
<p>France IS for the French!  It was created by them.  They have the right to set the rules over anyone else who chooses to live there (that they allow).  That&rsquo;s not evil; that&rsquo;s called majoritarianism.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I have no such assumption or misconception. I don&rsquo;t give them credit for being logical.  I am pointing out their ILLOGIC   &mdash;   a point you failed to get.</p>
<p>And since when is &#8220;French&#8221; considered a race?</p>
<p>Also (regardless of your dictionary definition), I am unaware that the National Front consider themselves &#8220;superior and have the right to rule over others&#8221;. Over whom?  They don&rsquo;t want alien peoples, non-Europeans, present to be ruled over. They don&rsquo;t want them there at all.  They just want to have their own country for themselves. That&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221;??? </p>
<p>Furthermore, the definition of racist/racism is so imprecise and nebulous that it is whatever its user wants it to be. That&rsquo;s why its such a useful tool for the extreme Left to hurl at those whom they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
