			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Faul, AT&T; News, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the young woman needed to use the toilet, she went out into the darkened tent camp and was attacked by three men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Women and children as young as 2, already traumatized by the loss of homes and loved ones in the Jan. 12 catastrophe, are now falling victim to rapists in the sprawling tent cities that have become home to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>With no lighting and no security, they are menacing places after sunset. Sexual assaults are daily occurrences in the biggest camps, aid workers say  &mdash;  and most attacks go unreported because of the shame, social stigma and fear of reprisals from attackers.</p>
<p>Rape was a big problem in Haiti even before the earthquake and frequently was used as a political weapon in times of upheaval. Both times the first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted, his enemies assassinated his male supporters and raped their wives and daughters.</p>
<p>But the quake that killed an estimated 200,000 people has made women and girls ever more vulnerable. They have lost their homes and are forced to sleep in flimsy tents or tarp-covered lean-tos. They&rsquo;ve lost male protection with the deaths of husbands, brothers and sons. And they are living in close quarters with strangers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sex-for-food is not uncommon in the camps, said a report issued Tuesday by the Interuniversity Institute for Research and Development in Haiti. &#8220;In particular, young girls have to negotiate sexually in order to get shelter from the rains and access to food aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In this camp, some 47,000 people live crowded into what used to be a sports ground in a neighborhood that always has been dangerous. Residents include a dozen escaped prisoners, among them a man accused of a notorious murder, according to Fritznel Pierre, a human rights advocate who lives at the camp.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pierre complained that the U.N. patrols are ineffective. &#8220;They only drive their cars down the one road that covers only a small portion of the camp. They never get out of their cars,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the hilltop suburb of Petionville, where plush mansions look out over slums on hillsides and in ravines, a 7-year-old rape victim was being treated Monday in the hospital of a tent camp set up on a golf course. Another child, a 2-year-old, had been raped in the same camp two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>The toddler is taking antibiotics for a gonorrhea infection of the mouth, according to Alison Thompson, who is the volunteer medical coordinator for a Haitian relief group created by Sean Penn. She helped treat both children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Besides sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy, victims face possible HIV infection. Haiti has the highest infection rate for the virus that causes AIDS in the Western hemisphere, with one in 50 people infected.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Few rapes are reported because women often face humiliating scrutiny from police officers who suggest they invited the attacks and even nurses who contend young girls were &#8220;too hot&#8221; in their dress style, according to Delva Marie Eramithe, a KOFAVIV leader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police spokesman Gary Desrosiers said only 24 rapes have been reported to Haitian authorities this year. Several suspects were detained, but many escaped when prisons collapsed in the quake, he said.</p>
<p>Police Chief Mario Andresol blamed the attacks on the more than 7,000 prisoners who escaped. &#8220;Bandits are taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents,&#8221; he told reporters two weeks after the quake.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are aware of problem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it&rsquo;s not a priority,&#8221; Information Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said last month.</p>
<p>Haitian police officers with stations minutes from some of the largest camps do not patrol  &mdash;  a fact that spokesman Desrosiers blames on the loss of dozens of officers killed in the quake, as well as scores who remain missing and more than 250 who were injured.</p>
<p>Still, that leaves some 9,600 Haitian police officers and 2,000 U.N. police officers.</p>
<p>The first signs of action came when U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived Sunday, and a contingent of female U.N. and Haitian police officers set up a tent at the camp.</p>
<p>Ban promised the camps will be &#8220;safe and secure.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The African nation of Senagal has offered to allow Haitians to relocate in their nation.  Most Haitians are descendants of slaves who came from Senegal.  These raped women should try to go to Senegal.  It would be a better place than Haiti.</p>

		<p>How much more proof do you need to see what blacks do when left to their own devices?  There&rsquo;s no electricity, no water, little food in Haiti - so do the citizens get together and try to devise intelligent solutions to their common problems?  No way.  They&rsquo;re too busy going out to attack, rape, assault, beat up, and terrorize women and men weaker than they are.  And their own authorities don&rsquo;t consider it a priority issue, so they are free to do as they will.  Haiti is the perfect example of black behavior unregulated by any kind of law.  Now perhaps people will see why blacks have to be watched closely and governed strictly in order to contain their unacceptable behavior towards the rest of society.  It&rsquo;s real clear to ME why blacks are in fact different from any other racial group.  And anyone who makes excuses for them is just blowing smoke.</p>

		<p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, over one million women from Ukraine alone have been sold into sexual slavery. The slow, disgraceful death these women have faced is unthinkable. Their cries have gone completely unheard. Where is the white America hating, wife beating, communist Sean Penn on this issue? No where to be found. Who cares about Sean Penn or anyone Sean Penn cares about. </p>

<p>And people will understand why blacks are disproportionally represented in our prisons.  Blacks are best left to their own devices, let&rsquo;s leave Haiti alone, we&rsquo;ll stay out of Haiti.  Besides, we&rsquo;ve already seen how all this assistance from white countries has barely made a dent of progress.  I&rsquo;m too wrapped up with my own concerns to continue closely watching or governing the behavior of blacks.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m frightened to imagine more of this being imported into the U.S.! Needless to say, this barbaric behavior will be blamed on the severity of the circumstances (yeah, as if poverty and calamity cause erections, ha!).</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t like the mildly accusatory tone of the article. The general sense is that these rapes are prevalent because so-and-so fails to prevent them. We all know that this is logically invalid. The inaction of the &#8220;authorities&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t cause rape. The desperate circumstances don&rsquo;t cause rape. The circumstances create opportunities, but they are not a cause (except by common Black logic, that is). It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the perpetrators of these rapes don&rsquo;t face mob justice. Surely they are substantially outnumbered by the law abiding. 7,000 escaped inmates roaming freely must be a nightmare. I say that because with their historically relaxed attitudes toward violence, the people who actually do wind up in jail must be the absolute worst of the worst.</p>

		<p>Why is any of this news, exactly? We saw the same thing during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. We saw the same thing during the strife in Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Congo and Nigeria. We see the same thing in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Jamaica. We see the same thing in American cities and towns.</p>

		<p>So they rape more frequently NOW than they did BEFORE the earthquake? Oh and there was a rape epidemic in Haiti long before the earthquake. Don&rsquo;t EVER forget what they did to the French men, women and children!</p>
<p>BTW, poster # 3 you are so right. Whites don&rsquo;t care about what happens to Whites. In fact, Whites work against their own interests to help mainly blacks worldwide. They pat themselves on the back for being so &#8220;caring&#8221;. I would like to know what happened to all that money that our government and Whites donated.</p>

		<p>So, presumably as we were instructed regarding looting(remember it&rsquo;s not really a crime, but a necessity), rape apparently is some sort of survival need as well? In the twisted, upside-down world we now live in, this probably sounds plausible to someone. </p>

		<p>I am wondering if this is all true. How many stories have we heard from different places in the world and find out way later that it was all a lie? I know that black men rape far more than do White men and that is a fact as Amren has printed the stats. I also believe this is a way of life for many in black culture.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that this will make way to bring in all these Haitian women and their children by the tens of thousands to America. Play on the sympathy of Whites and bingo! </p>
<p>My other concern is that White America has NEVER shown any concern for the rapes and murders of Whites in SA and America and all other White nations. Why is that? Our media covers black on White rape at all costs. It is never considered a hate crime. Take the Christian/Newsome case and the Wichita Murder/Rape for example. Will Whites ever wake up to reality? I don&rsquo;t see any sign of it whatsoever. In fact, Whites have been burying their collective heads for decades now when it concerns race.</p>

		<p>There is bound to be flooding in the mid-west this spring.  There are going to people driven from their homes.  Food and sanitation could be an issue.  Entire towns could be left in turmoil for extended periods of time.  I can say pretty confidently looting will not be an issue let alone rape of 2 and 7 year-old CHILDREN!  Imagine this, the people of this great region might even pick themselves up and do most of the rebuilding themselves!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask Sean Penn a question.  Are you a human being if you rape a 2 or 7 year old?  I don&rsquo;t care how up-ended your life has become, no matter how hard the deck is stacked against you, are you a human being if you rape a 2 or 7 year old?</p>

		<p>  This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard this story. After the quake, the controlled media kept much of the subsequent robbery and mayhem out of the papers. However, they did seem to linger a bit more on the Chilean looting after their quake. The Chilean quake was 500 times more powerful than Haiti&rsquo;s.<br>
 <br>
The MSM certainly had real trouble explaining why Chile had a death toll in the hundreds, while Haiti was over 200,000.  Corruption and poor building codes explain why Haiti had more killed. I believe Port au Prince only had one structural engineer?  What&rsquo;s the liberal solution  &mdash;  more Haitians moving to Florida&hellip; of course. <br>
