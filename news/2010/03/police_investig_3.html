<h1><a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/police-probe-klanlike-hood-found-on-ucsd-statue.html">Police Investigate Hood Found on UC San Diego Statue</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Ku Klux Klan-like hood was fashioned from a pillowcase and placed on a statue outside UC San Diego&rsquo;s main library, in what may be another racially provocative incident at the beach-side campus, officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>University police say they are investigating the matter as a possible hate crime and examining the hood for fingerprints and even DNA analysis.</p>
<p>The hood, with a hand-drawn cross inside a circle, was found about 11 p.m. Monday on the statue of Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as the children&rsquo;s book author Dr. Seuss, after whom the library is named. A rose was inserted into the statue&rsquo;s fingers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A campus spokesperson said {snip} [even] if the hood was intended as a prank, whoever placed it will be punished to the full extent of the campus&rsquo; student code and other laws, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not tolerate these despicable actions,&#8221; UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said in a statement released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The campus has been tense since a Feb. 15 off-campus party mocked Black History Month and, a few days later, a racial epithet was used on a student television show. Last week, a noose was discovered hanging from a Geisel library bookcase and a student, not publicly identified, has confessed to placing it there. She has said she had no racial motivation.</p>

<p>Putting this kind of concentration on an incident of little regard, and which will probably turn out to be just another black hoax, tells us this police unit has too many personnel and too much time on its hands.</p>
<p>If this is all they can find to do, they should be cut by at least two thirds.</p>

		<p>Oh, no!  What next???  </p>
<p>I must ask:  Is crime so rare in San Diego that the police there have the luxury of investigating hoods, pillow cases, nooses, and other nonsense?  </p>
<p>If so, we should all move there! It must be a heaven of tranquility where the worst possible crime that occurs is a pillow case on a statue.  Eeeek, horrors!</p>

		<p>The police used to ask a simple question when they had no leads: who benefits?  </p>
<p>Whites do not benefit from these incidents (or hoaxes).  But those with an agenda do benefit.  They play it up in the news. They often use the incident to demand special rights, more diversity, more funding, more sensitivity training, etc.</p>

		<p>In the University of Missouri &#8220;cotton ball&#8221; incident, it was found that two white men were the ones that sprinkled the cotton balls on the sidewalk, and they were both arrested on suspicion of committing a hate crime.  I&rsquo;m not kidding.  The Circuit Attorney will have the final decision on whether to draw hate crime riders to the littering charges, but they&rsquo;ve already been suspended from school.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re trying to pile on charges to get them to agree to drop out of school, and/or give &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; speeches, or grovel, in exchange for the ludicrous charges being dropped.  Since they&rsquo;re 19 and 21, they&rsquo;re probably easy to intimidate.</p>

<p>Geisel fled to the U.S. to escape repression in Europe. Was in part famous for his caricatures of the Japanese during WW2. You know, the buck teeth, the big coke-bottle eyeglasses with the squinty slanted eyes, the constant grin, etc.</p>
<p>The rose I am not sure what the meaning of that is.</p>
<p>A &#8220;minority&#8221; student hung the noose and the &#8220;party&#8221; was organized by a black man who specializes in such &#8220;events&#8221;.</p>
<p>The cotton balls is supposed to represent the slaves picking cotton? That one stumped for a moment. YEAH, littering. That is what we will get them on. YES!</p>

		<p>Which reminds me of a story from Britain read long ago. Two youths in Scotland nailed at the church door a &#8220;Wanted&#8221; poster, seeking for Elizabeth I, Scottish queen (as Elizabeth II is now also queen of Scotland under the  No.II and there wasn&rsquo;t any Scotttish No. I). <br>
The boys might have been sentenced under various offences of monarchy and state, but the judge simply fined them for displaying a poster at a place not allowed for such purposes. Oh, those were the days&hellip;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that American blacks allow spokesmen like Sharpton and Jackson, instead of someone who would come forward and make light of such incidents as cotton bolls, nooses, and hoods.  Of course, Obama could always do this.  He certainly won&rsquo;t lose the black vote, and almost all the left would be stricken mute by his gutsiness.  <br>
Blacks can never hope to see an end to bigotry and white resentment if they continue to allow themselves to be treated like helpless slaves whom the master must protect.  </p>

		<p>Just wondering&hellip; but supposin&rsquo; this hood was placed by Blacks? Something not as far from the realm of probability as one would suppose. We had a Houston Black female schoolbus driver. Complaining about racist words and signs in the school bus regularly assigned to her. Surprise, surprise, surprise. A POLICE investigation determined the woman had made the signs and painted the racist words herself. </p>

<p>First of all, if whoever placed the hood there is found and discovered to be a non-white, they will most assuredly NOT be &#8216;punished&rsquo;.  The incident will merely be dismissed, and the minority will not even be publically identified, just like what happened with the noose.</p>
<p>Second of all, if the police are investigating, presumably they must have identified a crime.  Notice that article never gets around to identifying what the crime was; something rather fundamental.</p>

		<p>20 concernicus:</p>
<p>Interesting you say that, because yesterday or the day before, there were massive protests at various colleges and universities, mainly in CA&rsquo;s public system.  I&rsquo;m wondering if all these &#8220;incidents,&#8221; the pillowcase, the cotton balls, etc. are all timed to this.  </p>
<p>As an aside, what is goofy about yesterday&rsquo;s protests is that we&rsquo;re being made to think that college students were protesting tuition and fee hikes.  However, you don&rsquo;t have to do dig very far to find that something weird is going on here.  Consider these two facts:</p>
<p>(1)  Young people really don&rsquo;t engage in these forms of mass protest and demonstration on their own, because that&rsquo;s not in the nature of young people.  If, for example, there is a group of 100,000 young men armed with all sorts of weapons that overrun a city, you can safely deduce that there&rsquo;s an old man with five stars on his helmet behind it.  Likewise, if masses of college students protest, there&rsquo;s a professor behind it.  </p>
<p>(2)  They&rsquo;re protesting tuition and fee increases?  Gee, sherlock, you&rsquo;re a little late to the party.  College tuition has been skyrocketing for as long as I&rsquo;ve been cognizant.  And only now they&rsquo;re supposedly concerned?  Of course, the reason tuition is skyrocketing is because it can.  Republocratic politicians love to tout their pro-&#8220;education&#8221; credentials by keeping the interest rates on student loans low, and increasing grant and scholarship amounts, and outside of government, there are many foundations and fund raisers that hustle money for more and more scholarship funds.  This means the more a given prospective college student can either borrow or receive in grants and/or scholarships, the more colleges can charge for tuition.  Republicans are bad at it, but the Democrats are worse, and it is no surprise:  Democrats and academia are two sides of the same coin.  Any Democrat proposal to &#8220;make college more affordable&#8221; does just the opposite, to make it less affordable.  AND THAT&rsquo;S EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT.  More money flowing through academia to develop/brainwash more future Democrats.  It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle   &mdash;   the more loan and grant money a student can get, the more colleges will raise tuition, thereby necessitating more loan and grant money, which means that colleges can raise tuition even more, and so on.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put the two together.  Why are professors egging on their students to engage in mass protest yesterday over something (tuition hikes) which would only benefit those same professors, and something that has been going on for decades?</p>
<p>I think the answer to this riddle is that it&rsquo;s not about tuition hikes.  I think what&rsquo;s going on in the background, what we&rsquo;re not being told, is that certain budget reform proposals at many universities, especially the public ones that are underneath the aegis of ailing state budgets, involves something the professorial class does not like   &mdash;   lower salaries, longer tenure tracks, increased use of non-tenured (i.e. lower salary) faculty for longer periods of time and for more courses (hint: the non-tenured ones would have to teach more credit-hours per semester because they don&rsquo;t have the safety of tenure), giving tenure more often to those who have not yet or never will earn a Ph.D. so that their salary demands are lower, or something which professors don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ll be plenty outraged about that too. When there is the next black man/white woman rape on campus the authorities will choose this moment to laud works like &#8216;To kill a mockingbird&rsquo; and condemn &#8216;stereotyping&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>To #23, I&rsquo;d say &#8220;If it&rsquo;s a stereotype that black men try to rape white women, look at the statistics and ask random white women you see around.  Ask them if they have almost been raped by a black man or if he tried to use his blackness as a ways to get her to sleep with him?&#8221;  That ought to stump them.</p>
