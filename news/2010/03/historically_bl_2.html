<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Also Known As: HBCU Capital Financing</p>
<p><b>Program Description</b></p>
<p>The goal of the program is to provide low-cost capital to finance improvements to the infrastructure of the nation&rsquo;s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Specifically, the program provides HBCUs with access to capital financing or refinancing for the repair, renovation, and construction of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, dormitories, instructional equipment, and research instrumentation. The program&rsquo;s authorizing statute caps the total amount of loans and accrued interest available through the program at $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>This assistance comes through the issuance of federal guarantees on the full payment of principal and interest on qualified bonds, the proceeds of which are used for loans.</p>
<p><b>Types of Projects</b></p>
<p>The loan proceeds of the HBCU Capital Financing Program can be used for repair, renovation or, in exceptional circumstances, the construction or acquisition of  &mdash;  </p>
<p>* Any classroom facility, library, laboratory facility, dormitory (including dining facilities) or other facility customarily used by colleges and universities for instructional or research purposes or for housing students, faculty, and staff;</p>
<p>* A facility for the administration of an educational program, or a student center or student union, except that not more than five percent of the loan proceeds provided under this part may be used for the facility, center, or union if the facility, center or union is owned, leased, managed, or operated by a private business that, in return for such use, makes a payment to the eligible institution;</p>
<p>* Instructional equipment technology, research instrumentation, and any capital equipment or fixture related to facilities described in subparagraph (A);</p>
<p>* A maintenance, storage, or utility facility that is essential to the operation of a facility, a library, a dormitory, equipment, instrumentation, a fixture, real property or an interest therein, described in this paragraph;</p>
<p>* A facility designed to provide primarily outpatient health care for students or faculty;</p>
<p>* Physical infrastructure essential to support the projects authorized under this paragraph, including roads, sewer and drainage systems, and water, power, lighting, telecommunications, and other utilities;</p>
<p>* Any other facility, equipment, or fixture which is essential to the maintaining of accreditation of the member institution by an accrediting agency or association recognized by the Secretary under Subpart 2 of Part H of Title IV.<br>

						<p>Program Office: Institutional Development and Undergraduate Education Service</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 84.120A<br>
Program Type: Discretionary/Competitive Grants<br>
Also Known As: MSEIP</p>
<p><b>Program Description</b></p>
<p>This program assists predominantly minority institutions in effecting long-range improvement in science and engineering education programs and increasing the flow of underrepresented ethnic minorities, particularly minority women, into science and engineering careers.</p>
<p><b>Types of Projects</b></p>
<p>The program funds are generally used to implement design projects, institutional projects, and cooperative projects. The program also supports special projects designed to provide or improve support to accredited nonprofit colleges, universities, and professional scientific organizations for a broad range of activities that address specific barriers that eliminate or reduce the entry of minorities into science and technology fields.</p>
<p><b>Provide Us Your Feedback</b></p>
<p>We value your feedback. If you have concerns or suggestions about how the Office of Postsecondary Education provides services to the public, please send an e-mail to OPE_FEEDBACK@ed.gov. We will review your comment and where applicable, will take appropriate action. This mailbox is monitored by staff outside the program office and your concerns will be communicated to the appropriate officials without your name or the name of your institution being shared unless absolutely necessary to address your concern. Should that be necessary, we will make every effort to contact you first.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t suppose these so called historically black institutions could seek donations form their alumni? most blacks want to attend white universities due to the low quality of education at the former.</p>

		<p>This is fine with me as long as whites can have their own colleges and programs, and white males are not selected out for being male.  But since this condition doesn&rsquo;t exist, this situation rings loudly of hypocrisy.  How long will we tolerate this situation?</p>

		<p>Hey, feds!  Hey, Obama!</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money you throw at education blacks will continue to fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like spending money to teach horses to fly, because some fool decides they can do so in spite of a wealth of facts to the contrary.</p>
<p>I said before the election that ALL Obama&rsquo;s efforts in favor of blacks will fail.  Nothing will change.  I&rsquo;ve since adjusted my assessment.  There will be a change after all:  Blacks will be worse off than before.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s considered wrong and evil for their to be white colleges. White = bad; non-white = good.</p>

		<p>#1, I disagree:  ALL colleges and universities are historically white, because it was from white people that the funding came for every single college and university in this country, be it white OR black.  (Wow - when are we going to get historically Asian colleges, historically Mexican colleges, historically Native American colleges -????)  Make no mistake, people, ALL folks who have gone to college/university have been educated on the backs of historically WHITE funding donors.</p>

<p>While discussing my son&rsquo;s plans for his future, he asked me what I enjoyed the most about my career in engineering.  I listed the following:</p>
<p>1. Intellectual challenge<br>
2. Great pay<br>
3. The profession is devoid of blacks</p>
<p>I am proud to say that he is enjoying his studies as an engineering student in a historically White university.    </p>
