<h1>Black Rector Stirs Once-White S. African School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donna Bryson, Google News, March 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first black leader in the 106-year history of the University of the Free State started his tenure last year with a surprise.</p>
<p>In his inaugural speech, rector Jonathan Jansen declared that the university would drop its criminal case against four white students accused of making a video where four black janitors eat a stew apparently spiked with urine. Jansen also offered two of the students who had been expelled the chance to resume their studies  &mdash;  the other two had graduated.</p>
<p>{snip} Some blacks were outraged, including the local head of the African National Congress Youth League, who accused Jansen of racism.</p>
<p>But Jansen said he was trying to start a conversation, and that racism cannot be resolved in the courts. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The furor points to the complexity of Jansen&rsquo;s mandate: To integrate a university in South Africa&rsquo;s conservative heartland, where blacks are still ushered to the back of restaurants. The university, virtually all white a generation ago, is now 60 percent black. But black and white students largely live and learn separately. And when Jansen took over, white students begged him, &#8220;Please don&rsquo;t force us to integrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He will. Jansen says preparing students for a future in a multiracial country means insisting: &#8220;If you want to study here, then you&rsquo;re going to have to learn to live together.&#8221;</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>A University of the Free State residence is more than just a dormitory. What&rsquo;s known here as a &#8220;rez&#8221; is closer to a U.S. fraternity or sorority, but with even more influence. Students take rooms in the residences where their parents once lived. They follow initiation rites that have been passed down for generations.</p>
<p>One residence was named for Hendrick Verwoerd, South Africa&rsquo;s prime minister from 1958-1966, a period during which apartheid was entrenched and black rights decimated. The name was not changed until 2006, to Armentum, Latin for a herd of large animals such as elephants, the house&rsquo;s mascot.</p>
<p>Most of the white students come from the surrounding province. They were nurtured in all-white schools and all-white churches in isolated farming communities where everyone spoke Afrikaans, the language of the descendants of early Dutch settlers. For more than a century, what was once known as the Orange Free State was an independent Afrikaner republic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2006, the Free State administration before Jansen&rsquo;s bowed to pressure and called for residences to be integrated. That&rsquo;s when the now-infamous video was made. It ends with the janitors being invited to move into the residence, and then an Afrikaans phrase appears in supertitles: &#8220;This is what we really think of racial integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jansen was brought in to try integration again. He announced that the new groups going into every residence would be half black and half white. But because those already living in the residences were not affected, the houses remain largely segregated.</p>
<p>Jansen has already stopped one residence from forcing first-year students to bow before the statue of a residence founder.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have black students bowing to a white guy they have no connection to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are traditions that are not shared and are offensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whether Jansen is pushing fast and hard enough for change is a matter of debate on campus. As he sat with friends at a picnic table on campus, Nande Ngxwana, a 20-year-old black student in his second year at the university, said he understood the rector&rsquo;s impulse to reach out to whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you blame a person for being racist?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel racism is something that was instilled in you. You grow up with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his friend Lwandile Magoda, also 20, said whites shouldn&rsquo;t be excused for their racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gets to a point when you&rsquo;re, like, 18, you have to think for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jansen said he understands that black Free State students are rankled by the lack of blacks in senior positions in a faculty that is a third white.</p>
<p>Jansen said one of his first acts as rector was to ask for a list of deans about to retire. There were 17, and he determined 15 would be replaced by women and blacks. But pushing whites out to make room for blacks more quickly would only repeat the mistakes of the past, when whites advanced at the expense of other groups, Jansen said.</p>
<p>Language is also a loaded issue: During apartheid, black students were forced to learn Afrikaans, the language of the white oppressor.</p>
<p>In his inaugural address, Jansen pledged to &#8220;open discussion on ways in which we can get every white student to learn Sesotho .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and every black student to learn Afrikaans, and all our students to learn to write and speak English competently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every course at the university is now offered in both Afrikaans and English. The result is that whites are isolated in the Afrikaans classes, and blacks in the English ones.</p>
<p>In her five years at Free State, Sune Geldenhuys, a 23-year-old white medical student, has rarely shared a class with a black student. But when students worked with patients in a black neighborhood this year, she had to turn to black students for translations. Geldenhuys said she could imagine returning to Free State to teach one day.</p>

<p>RIGHT.  The &#8220;white oppressor&#8221; who educated them, taught them a skill and a profession they would never have learned on their own.</p>

		<p>I found the video made by the four White students on Youtube.  They are mocking the Black workers throughout and I can see how this would anger the Black university students and administration.</p>

<p><i>To integrate a university in South Africa&rsquo;s conservative heartland, where blacks are still ushered to the back of restaurants.</i></p>
<p><br>
I have no direct experience with South Africa, so I can&rsquo;t prove my claim   &mdash;   but I must say that in a country ruled by black-supremacist socialists who feel free to sing about their machine guns and killing whites, I find the idea that &#8220;blacks are still ushered to the back of restaurants&#8221; VERY hard to believe.</p>
<p>The fact that the whole article is written from a very anti-white POV only reinforces my belief that we&rsquo;re being sold a bill of goods here. </p>
<p>And in any case, if Google News wants to report on South Africa, why are they choosing to devote their valuable space to a story about the  hurt feelings of a few blacks at a university instead of the shocking THREE THOUSAND DEAD WHITE FARMERS murdered by rampaging bantus in the brief post-Apartheid period? </p>

		<p>It was a silly student prank. If the students were black and the workers white nobody would even have thought about making an issue out of it. Everything whites do is blown out of proportion in order to keep them quite and biddable while they are genocided.</p>
<p>Since not only has over three thousand been viciously murdered and often tortured to death. Over 40 000 urban whites have ALSO been murdered and often tortured in the cities and towns. </p>
<p>Make no mistake.. this is a GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING. </p>
<p>And the communist ANC govt in South-Africa get away with this genocide since the leftist anti-white biased media use MISDIRECTION in order to blame the white victims for their own deaths. </p>
<p>Soon these things will come to every single formerly white country. Will you still complain about a student prank then Economist? When those students are your children and have to sit in silence while their entire racial group is genocided and they are vilified and demonized for a stupid prank.</p>

<p>I just watched the video.  Obviously the student took a water bottle out of his left pocket and squeezed out water.  </p>

		<p>Thanks Anon number 3! Hurting egos are more important than lives of food producers and taxpayers.  Also these students do not blink an eye when a 4 year old black girl gets raped and chopped up for Muti. </p>
<p>I mentioned the lack of outrage against muti killings in comments in an online liberal newspaper-but NONE of those comments were published-only the ones where my comments were on other subjects.</p>
<p>Blacks  South Africans are brain washed that all their problems are caused by white people.  Never do they blame lust,looting, liquor, laziness -so many suffer from being fatherless and many of them are their fathers` number 27th child -the society has to pick up the tab. Imagine the British government  condones a song that encourages the killing of citizens!  Outrage!  BUT the SA government can defend the song and encouraging it to be sung-where is the liberal outrage? The fact that `shoot the farmer` was broadcast ed on the news.  Not once but several times, is an indication of the level of the call to this genocide.  Hurt feelings-then it should be whites and more so white farmers and their families. <br>

<p>Good.  Forced integration will only hasten the inevitable, when they vote with their feet and leave the country.</p>
<p>Jansen will be saving many white lives if he convinces them to leave.</p>

		<p>One must note that Jonathan Jansen is not black. He is a coloured which is far from the black race. His home language therefore is not a black language but actually Afrikaans.<br>
A request I would like to put forward to Amren: An article describing and defining the term &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; as it is used in America.</p>

		<p>Well, there&rsquo;s always Orania.<br>
Smart whites don&rsquo;t want to associate with blacks, because they know black behavior.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; has nothing to do with it. </p>
