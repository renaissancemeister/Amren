<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/black-britain-unemployment-conservatives">We&rsquo;ll Change Black Britain</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Cameron, Guardian (London), March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Britain today, too many people are denied the chance to escape poverty and build a better life for themselves and their family. Sadly, this is especially true for people in Britain&rsquo;s black community. Black pupils are permanently excluded from school at more than twice the rate of white pupils. Some 9,500 black children leave primary school every year unable to read, write and add up properly. And of the 3,000 students who started at Oxford in 2008, only five are black Caribbean in origin. This inequality extends to the job market too, with recent research showing almost half of young black people are unemployed, well over twice the rate for young white people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going wrong? To a large extent, Labour&rsquo;s failure to address racial inequality echoes their failure to tackle inequality generally. Since 1997, income inequality, education inequality and health inequality have all widened, hitting the black community disproportionately hard.</p>
<p>A new Conservative government must do better. I want to take down the barriers that prevent so many black people realising their potential. In part, we&rsquo;ll do this through our core reform agenda. By tackling the causes of poverty, like poor schooling, family breakdown, addiction and welfare dependency, we can succeed where Labour has failed.</p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t just rely on across-the-board measures to boost social mobility. We&rsquo;ll introduce concerted action to overcome the racial barriers that exist in Britain today. One of the most obvious is when it comes to starting a business: Conservatives have always believed that enterprise is a powerful catalyst for social mobility. However, too many black people in Britain today are being denied the opportunity to start their own business and get on in life.</p>
<p>This is not because of a lack of aspiration. Research has shown that almost a third of black people in England want to start their own business, compared with just 9% of the white population. However, only 4% of black people do manage to launch a startup  &mdash;  a level lower than any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>Accessing finance and advice are the key challenges for would-be black entrepreneurs. According to one study, black entrepreneurs are four times more likely to be denied a bank loan outright than white entrepreneurs, while the UK Survey of Small and Medium Enterprises shows that as many as a quarter of black entrepreneurs report problems in accessing finance.</p>
<p>A Conservative government will help tackle these barriers by turning Labour&rsquo;s failing welfare schemes into a radical plan to get Britain working. This will include funding for a national mentoring programme for black people who want to start a business. It will provide would-be black entrepreneurs with the targeted support, advice  &mdash;  and, crucially, role models  &mdash;  they need to access finance and work for themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that role models are incredibly important. You only have to look at how children copy their parents to see how big an impact role models can have. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve worked so hard to get more black and ethnic minority Conservative party candidates.</p>
<p>But increasing the diversity of our parliamentary candidates is not just about getting our house in order. It too is also about role models. We&rsquo;ve selected successful black entrepreneurs  &mdash;  people like Sam Gyimah, Wilfred Emmanuel Jones and Helen Grant  &mdash;  as our candidates: not in Labour-held inner city seats, but in Surrey, Wiltshire and Kent. They&rsquo;ll help inspire a new generation of black people to take on the world.</p>
<p>So a Conservative government will tackle the racial barriers in Labour&rsquo;s Britain. We&rsquo;ll bring new energy to the task of building a country where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, irrespective of the colour of their skin.<br>

		<p>Keep on talking, Dave.  The more left you go, the more likely it is that the BNP will win MP seats.</p>
<p>I suppose decades of these schemes on the part of the Republican Party in America isn&rsquo;t enough to prove that it&rsquo;s all for naught?</p>
<p>Note that Cameron wants to create a subprime loan crisis for the UK.</p>

<p>Sir, that &#8220;barrier&#8221; is the foolish belief that blacks are intellectually capable of performing equally as well as Whites.</p>

		<p>Actually, they are changing Black Britain now. The question is, once Black Britons are in the majority, what part of formerly Great Britain will be set aside for White Britons?  Of course, even that won&rsquo;t be a question for long. White Britons are continuing their low birth rate march toward extinction so much so that one day not far off a homeland for White Britons will be moot.</p>

		<p>I can well believe more than a third of the blacks want to start their own business compared to 9% of the whites for the very simple reason that the whites of a fair idea of they are getting into. I was in Africa during the transition to independence and they all wanted their own business, a week before independence the office boys had a a raffle as to who would get my Mercedes and who would get my secretary. They all wanted to be business men, their idea was that a businessman sits in his office, period. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything, know anything, just sit and be the bwana makuba. I remember them in Uganda when the favoured were given the Indian owned stores, they had no idea they had to replenish the merchandise after they sold it. True to style, within a few months most of the stores were empty and shuttered. The business acumen they displayed was beyond belief,<br>
today, nearly fourty years later, I still wear the Bonsoir English silk pyjamas a bought by the dozen then. He was not sure how much they cost, luckily the price was on a little tag on the collar, 38s. 38 shilling at the time was $5 at the official rate of exchange, $2 at the market rate.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s because blacks everywhere are all talk, no action.  Whites actually think through the ramifications and business opportunities before announcing they want to start a business.  </p>
<p>Blacks are legends in their own minds.  Just ask inner city teenagers how many are &#8220;going to be&#8221; rappers or NBA stars - some of the self-declared future NBA stars aren&rsquo;t even on the high school basketball team and think some scout is going to pick them off their housing project&rsquo;s basketball court!</p>

<p>Why would that be (as the quote below indicates) that black people are nothing more than well-tanned white people? Could it be that black Britons have the same out-of-control spending habits as many black Americans, who face the same problem getting loans?</p>
<p><i>So a Conservative government will tackle the racial barriers in Labour&rsquo;s Britain. We&rsquo;ll bring new energy to the task of building a country where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, irrespective of the colour of their skin.</i></p>
<p>Here we go again with the canard that black people are just white people in &#8220;disguise&#8221;. If so, I wonder how that drug we devilish whites put in US currency make blacks crazy can tell the difference between black and white?<br>

		<p>Too bad Mr. Cameron did not suggest halting black immigration to the UK (legal and illegal). </p>
<p>Since he admits there are many more than are needed already, would this not be a good opportunity to argue in favor of no new black immigrants to the UK, at least until the ones already there could be assimilated into the economy?</p>

		<p>I have no ides who persuaded Cameron to use figures like that. It&rsquo;s really pathetic. &#8220;Research has shown that almost a third of black people in England want to start their own business, compared with just 9% of the white population.&#8221; One third of a few millions cannot compare to 9% of 60 million. Black businesses are mainly dingy afro-caribbean &#8216;jerk chicken&rsquo; take-aways, hair and nail parlours, used furniture shops and music or night club venues and all these cater only for blacks. The main road into central London from Kent cuts right through these areas and that could be considered a prime location. Nothing really useful that non-blacks would want. None of these would take more than a couple of hundred quid to set up and that could easily be raised from family and friends&hellip; if these were White.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem, non-whites are always looking for help - help from mentors, help from gov&rsquo;t, help from &#8216;the community&rsquo; to do practically anything.  Whites, myself included, generally realize that help may not always be forthcoming, and that if you have some dream, you will have to put the chutzpah in to make it a realty.  </p>
<p>Where I work, the white workers constantly bemoan how we have to constantly &#8216;hold the hands&rsquo; of the minority (majority) people here and &#8216;give them everything&rsquo; and protect them from feeling even a hint of setback or failure because it will damage their &#8216;self-esteem.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Even the ultra liberal teachers complain about this, because they&rsquo;re white and nobody helped them.  (Many of them have HUGE college loan debt, rather than the free scholarships so many non-whites get now.)  Funny thing is, the white (usually female) libs around here don&rsquo;t put two and two together and start asking tough questions.</p>

<p>  Honestly, I can&rsquo;t see any difference between the Tory and Labour platforms on the &#8220;equality&#8221; issue. Both parties favor continuing Britain&rsquo;s disastrous immigration policy. At present, only one party stands for the interests of indigenous working class white people  &mdash;  The British National Party.</p>

<p>What I want to know is: what is wrong with white people? This is exactly what happens with blacks everywhere in the entire world, and yet foolish whites act surprised when it happens yet again. Surely, this is a sign of insanity. Why in the world would anyone expect any different results than these? Why did Britain think that it would have much better results with its blacks than the U.S. had with African-Americans?</p>
<p>&#8220;According to one study, black entrepreneurs are four times more likely to be denied a bank loan outright than white entrepreneurs&#8221;</p>
<p>When are these lefties going to realize that this sort of attitude is what led to the financial crisis? The Left twisted everybody&rsquo;s arms to make them give out loans to minorities who should have rightfully been denied based on their collateral, credit, qualifications, experience, etc. It is hardly any surprise that that didn&rsquo;t work out. </p>
<p>What a joke to call this the Conservative Party!</p>

<p>You know, we&rsquo;re all convinced it&rsquo;s some kind of a master scheme to destroy the white race, or at least turn our morals to mush, but what if it&rsquo;s just about forcing people to be tolerant, to be nice? One problem is that the sanctions and double-speak, rub people who are already decent, simply the wrong way. And it creates &#8216;victims&rsquo; of it&rsquo;s own. Is it a means-justifies the end, stratigem, so we should be &#8216;conservative&rsquo; and support it? Also, what we see could be simply random, the outcome of the path of least resistance for everyone. Of course it still might be just about destroying our countries and our race. <br>

		<p>       To Everyone here:<br>
 Dave Cameron is right on!! It&rsquo;s time that Britain stops trying to<br>
go back to the days of colonialism and exclusion. People of color<br>
are 12-15% of the gen. pop. Therefore, this country needs to accept it. Afterwards, everybody work as a team to need useless<br>
welfare policies. Then push for programs of self reliance that <br>
will benefit all Britons-black, white, asian exct. Any other way<br>
will be disasterous. <br>
    Next, the BNP are nothing but corrupt hypocrites. They don&rsquo;t even have a clue of what&rsquo;s really going on. What&rsquo;s killing the U.K. isn&rsquo;t the non-white or other immigrants. What&rsquo;s destroying this once great country is poor gov. policies. Also, you have that decadent Royal monarchy family worth $27-28 billion dollars.<br>
Furthermore, there&rsquo;s North sea&rsquo;s oil company that&rsquo;s worth $35 billion dollars. This company is making a fortune while the average Briton is paying the equivalence of $6.00 a gallon for gas.Thus, those are the dilemmas this country is facing. They better start dealing with that before pointing fingers at others <br>
,who look different. By the way, the BNP are now taking non-white members, go-figure!! Alright, that&rsquo;s all for my diatribe but truly analyze before making off-beat comments.<br>
             Sincerely,<br>
10th cav. spectre from Madtown!!</p>

		<p>I suppose that this is the best place to insert this; I happened to tune into the BBC radio broadcast on NPR, or a derivative talk show earlier this week.  They had an &#8220;expert&#8221; on race interviewed.  Remarkably, she did not only imply, but simply stated that there is no actual white race, but those taken for white are simply blacks with less melanin.  She used the Out of Africa argument to further parlay the political interpretation of genetics that since everyone developed from the same origin, whites share the same dna as blacks (and just a little less than chimpanzees).  Through this illogical rationale, she madet he argument that race is good to recognize when deconstructed the notion of whites as people, but useful in determining the rights of those unfairly displaced by whites.  Really, it made no sense, but she spoke with all the authority of a priest.  Her interviewer likewise knew exactly which question to pose next in order to bring the conclusion.</p>
<p>Of course, nearly everyone is using these sort of argument tactics on radio and tv these days.  And that is because all sides have been doing it for so long in order to promote their brand.  It should be no surprise to anyone that as the general population is dumbed down, drugged down, or otherwise biased by their own illogical argumenmts, it has come down to who can foist the most outrageous conclusions and get away with it.</p>
