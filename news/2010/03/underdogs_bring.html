<h1>Underdogs Bring to Light: Time to Fight Trite, White Stereotypes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Freeman, CBS Sports, March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Saint Mary&rsquo;s Omar Samhan owns a vicious big-man game and significant athletic ability, which made it all the more strange why, when during the Gaels&rsquo; embarrassing defeat of Villanova the Wildcats&rsquo; coach, Jay Wright, decided to mostly single-cover him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get it,&#8221; Samhan said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a slow white guy, and I&rsquo;m overweight. So maybe you don&rsquo;t respect me because I have good numbers. But after I kill you the first half, what are you waiting for? I don&rsquo;t know what he wanted. Did he want me to have 40?&#8221;</p>
<p>He ended up with 32 points. Close enough. I pulled aside Samhan, my new favorite player in the tournament, and asked him to elaborate on that quote. He summed up beautifully a phenomenon that is again creeping into fan and media dialogue as the NCAA tournament progresses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people still see a white team or white players and think we can&rsquo;t play,&#8221; Samhan explained. &#8220;It&rsquo;s offensive sometimes. It still goes on. That perception is wrong. It makes no sense. We&rsquo;re all good athletes. White, black, red, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rhetoric that white basketball players are all smart and non-athletic was supposed to die in the 21st century. But now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&rsquo;s baaaaacckk.</p>
<p>As mostly white teams like Saint Mary&rsquo;s, Northern Iowa, Cornell and even Duke have advanced, a certain type of rhetoric has returned with tornadic vengeance. {snip}</p>
<p>The New York Times called Saint Mary&rsquo;s heady. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The perception is we&rsquo;re a bunch of white guys who can&rsquo;t play and some of us are from Australia so we&rsquo;re not all that talented,&#8221; said Saint Mary&rsquo;s player Mickey McConnell, speaking of the five Australian players on the team. &#8220;We can play. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Each of these mostly white teams is athletic as hell. You don&rsquo;t get to the Sweet 16 by not being elite athletes. You don&rsquo;t make the tournament by not being extremely athletic. Hell, you don&rsquo;t make a Division I basketball team by not being a supreme athlete.</p>
<p>Again, we were supposed to be beyond these infantile stereotypes and primal desires to stupidly categorize. Instead, here we are. Again.</p>
<p>These stereotypes continue to work both ways, too. If white players are smart and hard-working what does that make African American players? Imbecilic and lazy?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>My firm belief is Kansas lost because some of the Jayhawks players looked across the floor and saw a white team and thought: &#8220;We can take these guys. Jeez. Look at &#8216;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Jayhawks got smoked and didn&rsquo;t realize until the end they were playing a bunch of talented athletes.</p>
<p>Some of these underdog teams, underestimated and underappreciated because of their ethnicity, might lose this weekend. They all might.</p>
<p>Opponents should still be weary. Teams ignore and downplay the athleticism of a Saint Mary&rsquo;s, Northern Iowa or Cornell at their own risk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I believe the site to go to that exposes the media stereotypes of White athletes is - www.castefootball.us</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re attacking White people in everything, including sports, tearing down our collective ego is every way that they can think of, making us appear now to be unathletic.  Only Blacks can run, dance and jump; this is the image they try to portray.</p>

		<p> Excellent column   &mdash;   excellent points. I would rather a White sportswriter had penned it, but they&rsquo;d probably be afraid of being called &#8220;White racists&#8221; if they did so. But never mind the source   &mdash;   it was definitely something that needed to be said. I tend to avoid college sports on TV any more because there&rsquo;s usually absolutely nobody out there I can identify with. But I may well watch a game or two as this tournament winds up. They ARE still playing, aren&rsquo;t they?!</p>

		<p>About White people being taken seriously regarding basketball&hellip;.seriously, WHO CARES? Our dance card is already full, running WESTERN CIVILIZATION! Seriously, virtually every tech advance in the last 150 yrs. has Whitey&rsquo;s stamp on it. If you see two bricks standing in U.S. or E.U. a white man either engineered it, built it or payed for it, or any combination of the three. Virtually any occurence worth a damn in the last 1000 yrs had a white man involved. White men can&rsquo;t jump? Maybe not, but we can clone cells,split the atom,burn a hole thru steel using light beams,harness microwave energy,travel faster than the speed of sound,land a man on the moon and a rover on Mars,harness starlight to see in darkness etc. etc. all of this in less than a century using our GOD given intellect. Of course none of this compares to the awe inspiring act of putting an air filled ball thru a hoop. <br>

<p>Thank you, Awakened. In fact, they love it even more when the subject is racially MIXED   &mdash;    black father, white mother, that is (maybe not so much the other way around).</p>
<p>As for him being a Moslem, I hAve to wonder about that. He is, after, all attending a Catholic university.  And that name: &#8220;St. Mary&rsquo;s Gaels&#8221; is ironic, considering.  There was a time when the only way an Egpytian could get an Irish woman into bed was to buy or capture her as a slave. Never voluntarily on her part!</p>

		<p>White Men can do ANYTHING better than black. Look throughout history.</p>
<p>They claim to be the &#8216;original people&rsquo; of this earth but yet they havent progressed beyond eating eachother and raping little children in packs like wolves. </p>
<p>They are worthless. Everyother country knows it&hellip;.and ONLY the White liberal lower class raises them above themselves. They have no Dignity, no Integrity, they loathe themselves and everything like them, they have a psychological disorder in themselves that makes them feel guilty and worthy of punishment. They feel that they are &#8216;fortunate&rsquo; and feel pity for the black race, not their situation with their new cars, new houses, free food and housing, government jobs that pay for nothing..etc. Thats not good enough in a White liberals eyes. They feel have to be worshipped, idolized, adored and favored&hellip;catered to, shown the &#8216;way&rsquo; to the White Mans world&hellip;to save them from themselves. (Notice the &#8216;feels&rsquo;. Thats a White liberal).</p>
<p>Because theyve been conditioned&hellip;to be self-executing cowards. Effiminate little girly-boys. The only problem with their suicidal obsession is that they take the others with them, like We feel the same way they do. Like We want to be the servants of satans seed&hellip;..like we feel soory for being the Superior People. </p>
<p>Here they are when the restraints are off. <br>

<p>Check them out.  Things like this have been happening in Washington st, Ohio, and Im sure other places that we dont know about. THIS is what White liberals embolden. THIS is what White liberals endorse. And these are the type people they feel are superior to them.</p>
<p>Utterly pathetic&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I was watching the Kentucky-Cornell game last night.</p>
<p>The all-black Kentucky team defeated the nearly all-white Cornell team.</p>
<p>So blacks have their fleeting moment of glory. The Kentucky guys with the exception of one or two who will play in the NBA will be has-beens at the age of 22.</p>
<p>The white Ivy-Leaguers from Cornell will go on to successful careers that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Omar Samhan&rsquo;s father is a White Egyptian, and Samhan identifies himself as White, looks White, and acts White. what more can you ask for?</p>
<p>check out Caste Football for more on the subject of White/black athleticism. its forum is filled with knowledgable individuals who repeatedly dismantle the myth that blacks are better athletes than Whites. the truth is that there are countless White athletes who are as good as (or better than) the guys you see playing in college or the pro leagues but are pushed aside in favor of &#8220;reel affletes&#8221; of the proper skin tone. affirmative action is rampant in the field of athletics, and Caste Football proves it.</p>

		<p>12 Nick:</p>
<p>An SI writer quipped that the Kentucky-Cornell game last night was a match between three future NBA stars and their future financial advisers.  So true.</p>
<p>One can only hope that unlike another Kentucky product referenced on AR earlier this week, one Antoine Walker, that Messrs. Wall, Cousins and Bledsoe pay attention to their Cornell-educated financial advisers.  Though I&rsquo;m with you   &mdash;   All three of them seem like future 8 ppg NBA journeymen if they&rsquo;re lucky.  I&rsquo;ve watched their style of play, and I&rsquo;m aware of their size, and men like that come a dime a dozen in the professional ranks.  They won&rsquo;t have that much money to waste.</p>
<p>As an aside, Cousins claimed he was getting racial slurs texted to him from Mississippi State basketball fans.  In other words, fans of a team where 13 of the 18 team members and 5 of the 5 starters are black are calling a black man the n-word and other slurs.  Get real.</p>

		<p>It has been a huge part of the American Media&rsquo;s attack on all things White to run down White athlete. Often it is a fair Black writer like this one to give our guys an honest acknowledgment that yes, Whites can compete and do very well.</p>
<p>The worst media bias against Whites is in Boxing. As Whites have dominated the middle and heavier weight divisions for about 10 years. The media and the American anti White boxing establishments hates to see Whites fighting and wining in boxing.</p>
<p>Please support our White boxing champions - we have a title fight this weekend that the American television media is choosing to Black out.<br>

		<p>Great post from WASPInsurgent.  I too ask: Seriously, who cares?</p>
<p>Oh, btw, might I point out that basketball was invented by white men?</p>
<p>So was baseball, football, soccer, cricket, and most (maybe all)  of the spots that blacks love today. Africans, so far as I know, do not play sports of their own inventing. (What sports came out of Africa, pray tell?)</p>
<p>The fact is that sports are almost entirely a white, European invention (largely British in fact), like so much else, that would be unknown throughout the rest of the world without the white man to spread them. </p>
<p>[The sole exception that I can think of were the American Indians. I include the polo players of Northern India with Caucasians.]</p>

<p><br>
He has woolly hair, dusky skin, and doesn&rsquo;t look &#8220;white&#8221; to me.  Thus, his Egyptian father must have been even less white.  Perhaps his father was considered &#8220;white&#8221; by social standards in Egypt,  but not here.  I know white when I see it, and he&rsquo;s not really white.</p>

		<p>I have written about this once and will write again. This myth spread by the mainstream media of Whites being without talent in sports is utter rubbish.<br>
If you look at &ldquo;Strong man&rdquo; competitions, the winners are typically white men of mostly Northern European (includes Eastern Europeans) ancestry.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Strongest_Man" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World&rsquo;s_Strongest_Man</a></p>
<p> The top weight lifters, wrestlers, fencers, race car drivers and fighter pilots are mostly white. White people are the most generalised specialised human population. East Asians and blacks are super specialised in only some physical traits. East Asians have the fastest reaction time due to which they dominate sports like table tennis and badminton. The reaction time is slowest in blacks. Thus, in sports such as table tennis, blacks do not stand a chance to compete with East Asians. The only people who come close to challenging East Asians are Whites. Similarly West African descendant people are fast and dominate sports like sprinting, but are pathetic in endurance events which is dominated by Horn Africans and Eastern Africans. But East Africans and Horn Africans are pathetic in sports like sprint needing extreme speeds for short durations. But of all the races it is whites are second to only West African descended blacks in sprinting, second to only East Africans/ Horn Africans when it comes to endurance events. East Asians do not stand a chance to compete with Africans in both sprinting like sports or endurance like sports. Swimming for example is dominated by Whites and the only population with a realistic chance of challenging Whites are East Asians not blacks. Whites are also taking over all the major boxing titles from blacks, a fact the media tried to hide under the carpet. <br>
Extremely mixed or generalised races (in a belt from the middle East via South Asia to South East Asia for example) are pathetic in Olympics like sports. India with a billion plus population hardly wins more than two medals in an Olympics. <br>
In the 2004 Summer Olympic, of the 929 medals awarded, approximately 70 percent, or 650, were won by White athletes. East Asian athletes won 154 medals, or 16.6 percent, while blacks athletes won 89 medals, or just 9.6 percent of the total. The rest were won by athletes from other groups. <br>
In the 2006 Winter Olympics, of the 252 medals awarded, 228, or almost 91 percent, were won by White athletes. East Asian athletes won just over 9 percent of the medals, with 23 total, and only one medal was won by a black. Of course one could ignore the Winter Olympics as blacks are not built for the cold climate. But if you believe that blacks or people from the tropics hardly win medals in winter sports because they do not participate, you are wrong. Check out the participating nations in the recent Winter Olympics held in Canada where nations such as Ghana, Jamaica and India have participated. <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics</a></p>
<p>There are many sports that require no special equipment or expenses, but blacks just don&rsquo;t have the build to emerge as top champions in these sports, e.g., cycling, bench pressing, karate, etc. The denser bones of blacks means that they cannot dominate swimming. The shorter, less powerful trunks of blacks means that they cannot dominate wrestling or bench pressing. The strength-agility-reaction time combination in blacks is such that they cannot dominate martial arts. The leg proportions of blacks, with relatively longer lower legs, means that they will not be dominating cycling. And so on; no amount of training, nutrition or good facilities is going to change this. <br>
Blacks dominate only a few sports, and it is clear that Whites are overall the best athletes. The media also spreads misinformation about North East Asians being physically inferior. But they dominate all other Asians in sports with ease.<br>
