			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen Reports, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the country wrestles with a future of historic-level deficits, 67% of U.S. voters say that illegal immigrants are a significant strain on the U.S. budget.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two-out-of-three (66%) voters say the availability of government money and services draw illegal immigrants to the United States. Nineteen percent (19%) think otherwise and do not believe government money and services are a magnet for illegal immigration. Another 15% are not sure.</p>
<p>These findings help to explain why 68% say gaining control of the border is more important than legalizing the status of undocumented workers already living in the United States. Twenty-six percent (26%) think legalizing illegal immigrants is more important.</p>
<p>The majority support for controlling the borders has been consistent through several years of surveying.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other hand, 45% believe it&rsquo;s at least somewhat likely that Congress in the next year will pass legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. This finding includes 10% who say it&rsquo;s very likely.</p>
<p>Forty-seven percent (47%) think it&rsquo;s unlikely that Congress will approve legislation in the next year that makes it possible for those who are here illegally to become U.S. citizens. Of that number, nine percent (9%) say it&rsquo;s not at all likely.</p>
<p>This belief that Congress is more likely not to do what the majority of voters favor illustrates why unhappiness with Congress has reached the highest level ever recorded by Rasmussen Reports. {snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent (56%) say the policies and practices of the federal government encourage people to enter the United States illegally. Twenty-seven percent (27%) disagree, and 17% are not sure.</p>
<p>Seventy-five percent (75%) of voters are angry at the government&rsquo;s current policies, up nine points since September.</p>
<p>A majority of voters across virtually all demographic categories agree that illegal immigrants are a strain on the budget and that they are drawn to America by the availability of government money and services. But there are partisan differences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eighty percent (80%) of voters rate the issue of immigration as at least somewhat important in determining how they will vote in the next congressional election. That includes 50% who say it is very important to them.</p>

<p>Considering that almost 26% of USA residents are immigrants or the children of imigrants, it is not surprising that 26% of people think leagalizing illegal immigrants is important.</p>

<p>That 44% of the people don&rsquo;t blame the government shows how out of touch they are and the impossibility of turning things around generally.</p>

<p>Of coure illegals are. Sure they provide slave wage labor for their unscrupulous employers, but it&rsquo;s the rest of America that has to pick up the tab for their emergency room visits, education of their children, incarceration and lawyers for those that commit crime, fraudulent welfare claims and other social services for their kids. Look at California with the highest level of illegal immigration. Far from being a help to their economy, Cali is now broke.</p>

<p>Exactly. For example, the feds force states to educate illegal aliens because of a 5-4 Supreme Court decision that was made in the early 1980s, and only recently have they made a resonable to stop people at the border. Remember when California tried to stop the illegal invasion in 1994 by outlawing welfare and schooling only to see their efforts stymied by the courts because immigration control is supposedly a &#8220;federal matter.&#8221; Now the once golden state is a complete mess, its downfall caused in no samll part by policies and practices of our fed. government. California has gone from being the land of opportunity, great weather, natural beauty and easy living to being a finicially ruined, polyglot hell hole in a only a short matter of time. </p>

		<p>It is the responsibility of &ldquo;we the people&rdquo; to obliterate the Hispanic illegals who invade our nation and end up in our communities.  </p>
<p>This URL points out how many Americans die at the hands of Hispanic (mostly Mexican) illegals every year.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know how many American men, women and children are crippled, maimed and burned annualy on our highways by drunken, unlicensed and uninsured Hispanic (mostly Mexican) illegals, but it has to be many times the number of those who are slaughtered…   </p>

		<p>Anybody who DOESN&rsquo;T think the illegals are a strain on the budget doesn&rsquo;t live in a border state.  My state, CA, is bankrupt because the illegals have inundated our healthcare, education, and welfare systems.  We don&rsquo;t have enough money for legal Americans who need help because of these miserable illegals.  Any Californian who isn&rsquo;t a first generation Mexican wants the illegals deported.  Mexicans who came here legally want the illegals deported!  Maybe if you live in a state far from the border, like Iowa for instance, it&rsquo;s harder to understand the impact the illegals have on state monies.  And if you DON&rsquo;T want to know about that, don&rsquo;t move to CA!!</p>

<p>Not at all Ranger, it is the 56% that are FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING those 44% which are probably the illegals and their supporters.<br/>

		<p>  Those numbers of both 67 and 56 percent of Americans, tell the whole story of our former republic&rsquo;s culturalcidesince 1965 A.D. and ultimate demise and with the non-White parasitic population ever increasing, these numbers will only go down more. If only White Americans treated themselves as well as they treat non-Whites; those percentage numbers would be much higher logically.Self preservation and the Golden Rule is normal and moral while self- destruction is neither .</p>

		<p>The Tea Party movement is largely the result of political deafness to such issues as illegal immigration.  The GOP establishment wants cheap labor, and the Dems want Hispanic votes.  By 2012, this problem will not be just an elephant in the room, but an enraged bull elephant stamping his feet and brandishing his tusks.  <br/>
I can&rsquo;t see the Dems making it over to the anti-illegal position in 2 years, so that leaves the Repubs or a third party.  If Romney&rsquo;s the GOP candidate, he has a history (in MA) of telling voting blocs whatever they want to hear and doing something else.  If the Tea Party fields a strong candidate, he/she will likely split the conservative vote and throw the election to Obama.  Obviously, the GOP is already worried about this.  The party had better find a strong, outspoken person who can make voters believe that anti-illegal measures are solidly in the Repub plan.</p>

		<p>Ranger, #2 it&rsquo;s with great sadness I completely agree with you. I believe this [formerly] great nation is beyond repair. Call it a defeatist attitude if you wish, and I wholeheartedly hope I&rsquo;m wrong, but the overwhelming shift in the number of touchy-feely, liberal, crybaby fruitloops has got me worried. If more of us in this country believe as we Amrenners do, then why are so many on the other side? Maybe I&rsquo;m just having a down day, but I see no shift in this at least in my lifetime.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t see the Dems making it over to the anti-illegal position in 2 years,</p>
<p><br/>
I&rsquo;d like to point out that, back before he became a global warming wingnut (and he was still vice president of this country), Al Gore had an A- rating with Americans for Better Immigration.  This was in direct opposition to the open borders policies of both Reagan and Bush Sr.</p>
<p>My point is the immigration issue isn&rsquo;t a partisan one.  Neither party advocates shutting off the flow of immigrants.  Both parties, however, HAVE flirted with the idea.  Either party could be convinced to become hostile to immigration if it results in political power for them.  The time is ripe to create that sort of political environment.</p>
<p>NONE of the rank and file, currently, are good prospects for this, in either party.  That is turning out to be a major stumbling block for them.  People like Romney, Huckabee, McCain and Obama are facing extreme indifference from voters.  This issue is part of the reason why.  Palin had the chance to tap into this and almost guarantee she would be the next candidate.  She chose not to&hellip;..now her star is fading fast.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;d like to point out that Ron Paul, is both the favorite of Tea Party people and has major plans to dramatically decrease government spending, including welfare of all types and &#8220;entitlement spending&#8221; in all its forms.  With half of all immigrants using welfare, despite if it is legal for them or not, this will be a major motivation for them to leave.</p>
<p>In fact, I would go so far to say that, if tomorrow morning it was announced that all welfare in this country was suspended forever, rather than riots and mass chaos, the result would be a flood of 20 to 50 million people running as fast as they could from the US into mexico.  Immigration is completely and totally created by the behavior of white governments.  Where there is no welfare, there are no non-whites&hellip;.that is the absolute bottom line.</p>
<p>If you want the non-whites gone, get rid of the welfare.  Better yet, discriminate with welfare (example: you have to pass a drug test every month to qualify for welfare).  This isn&rsquo;t just about the specific instance of a person needing the welfare to exist in a country like ours.  Immigrants don&rsquo;t like being here.  They despise us.  They despise our culture.  They despise everything about being here.  For them, living in a free, democratic society where everyone is more or less moral, is extremely irritating and toxic.  They come here because of socialism.  More importantly, they stay because of socialism (and no other reason).</p>
<p>Dismantle socialism and they will vanish.  Of all the potential presidential candidates, only Ron Paul plans to dismantle socialism.</p>
<p>You can read more about what he plans here.  Note the broad appeal what he is planning has to people on both the left and the right.</p>

		<p>Anyone who does NOT believe illegal (or even legal) immigrants are a strain on the national budget&hellip; has to have their heads stuffed in a physically improbable place!</p>
<p>Count the Mexican faces in the E.R. section of your local hospitals. Do the same for welfare/public assistance offices. Count the number of Latinos in your local public school system.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to factor in the crime statistics or the cost of incarcerating Latino felons to understand they place an intolerable burden on American taxpayers.</p>

		<p>I would respectfully ask the management of AmRen to run articles DEMONSTRATING THE CURRENT DOLLAR COST, as well as crime statistics for illegal immigrants. We had a study several years ago by, I believe the Brookings Institute featured on AmRen. But that was four or five years ago, using far earlier figures.</p>
<p>I post on NewsVine and do my utmost to wake people to the cost, crime and problems of illegal immigration. Good current statistical documentation would help immensely.</p>
