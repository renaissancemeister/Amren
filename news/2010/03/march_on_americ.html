<h1><a href="https://www.westernyouth.org/articles/march-on-america/">March on America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William L. Houston, Youth for Western Civilization, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Yesterday, I attended the so-called &#8220;March for America&#8221; in Washington, DC with two fellow YWC members. We wanted to see the constituency for &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; ourselves. The MSM has already leapt into action to put a pro-amnesty spin on the rally. We are told &#8220;a few demonstrators waved flags from other countries.&#8221; That&rsquo;s not what I saw.</p>
<p>YWC shot about 200 photos of the rally and an hour of footage with two video cameras. I&rsquo;ve uploaded all our photos to Flickr here, here, and here. Some of the video footage is below [see <a href="https://www.westernyouth.org/articles/march-on-america/" target="original" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>article on original site</b><a/>], along with a slideshow with some of the images. We caught all kinds of stuff on tape that the MSM is not reporting.</p>
<p><b>Impressions:</b></p>
<p>1.) The crowd that gathered on the National Mall was overwhelmingly Latino. I would estimate that 85% to 90% of the demonstrators were immigrants, illegal aliens, or some type of Hispanic-American. In particular, El Salvador was drastically overrepresented. There also seemed to be more Dominicans and Colombians in attendance than Mexicans.</p>
<p>2.) At least half of the demonstrators were chattering among themselves in Spanish and other foreign languages. The chants from the crowd kept slipping back into Spanish over and over again. We got this on tape.</p>
<p>3.) The crowd that gathered on the National Mall WAS NOT representative of America. I felt highly conspicuous and out of place as a White Southern male from Alabama. I got lots of dirty looks. I kept sarcastically asking my YWC colleagues: where are the natives? It is clear that &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; is supported by a narrow constituency (i.e., immigrants and their families) that will directly benefit from the legislation and opposed by the American Majority who will be forced to pay the costs.</p>
<p>4.) Most of the demonstrators were smart enough to wave the American flag, but the whole scene looked staged on closer inspection. This wasn&rsquo;t a spontatneous outburst of American patriotism like you see at the Tea Parties. Rather, it was tens of thousands of people waving small American flags (which the organizers provided them with) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they want something in return, namely, American citizenship and access to taxpayer subsidized public services. It was a PR stunt.</p>
<p>5.) The most passionate demonstrators were the ethnic chauvinists waving their huge foreign flags. There were A LOT of these people on the National Mall. There were so many of them in attendance that I quit snapping photos of foreign flags after 100th or so shot to prove my point.</p>
<p>6.) Some Latino demonstraters had bigoted, anti-European signs. There were signs at the rally which claimed that North America is a &#8220;Bronze Continent&#8221; that belongs to Indians and Latinos. There were others which claimed that Europeans were illegal immigrants. mECha and La Raza were there.</p>
<p>7.) Communists were at the &#8220;March for America&#8221; waving huge Red flags with the hammer and sickle and yellow star. These flags were on prominent display (stood out from the crowd) and we shot several photos of them.</p>
<p>8.) We encountered three or four Socialist groups working the crowd. One guy tried to SELL US a copy of The Socialist Action. Apparently, socialists are not adverse to the profit motive! The &#8220;Partido Socialista De Los Trabatadores&#8221; had a booth in front of the Smithsonian. Another socialist group had a sign that called the Democratic and Republican parties &#8220;two parties of racism, imperialism, and anti-worker attacks.&#8221; Another group of socialists was selling The Militant in English and Spanish.&#8221; &#8220;International Socialists for Social Equality&#8221; of the &#8220;World Socialist Web Site&#8221; had a booth where they were selling books about Leon Trotsky.</p>
<p>9.) Black power groups were at the rally. We saw attendees wearing black power shirts and selling copies of Malcolm X, Black Liberation, and the Road to Workers Power in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>10.) Che Guevera fans were out in force. When we got off the Metro, literally the first guy who approached us was a crazy leftist from LaRouche PAC. For those unfamilar with Lyndon LaRouche, his group believes that America is controlled by the Queen of England who invented AIDS to exterminate black people.</p>
<p>11.) Puerto Rican nationalists were at the rally.</p>
<p>12.) A crowd of filthy anarchists from SDS DC (some without t-shirts) marched down the street with various signs including &#8220;Smash the State,&#8221; &#8220;Smash Capitalism,&#8221; and &#8220;Funk the Borders.&#8221; Apparently, this group attacked a military recruiter with a paint bomb the day before.</p>
<p>13.) As we were leaving, we noticed Latino demonstrators walking over a discarded American flag on the sidewalk. We shot some video of those patriotic Americans which we will share on YouTube.</p>
<p>14.) A group of mimes threatened violence against Roy Beck of Numbers USA and the police escorted him off the National Mall. We also saw the mimes at the rally. Maybe Beck&rsquo;s problem was the security. Leftists kooks were everywhere.</p>
<p>15.) The highlight of the demonstration was seeing a furious American and his wife enter the demonstration after touring the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. I saw him wave his hand and yell at the crowd, &#8220;if these people would all get jobs, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Final Thoughts:</b></p>
<p>The tens of thousands of Latinos who demonstrated on the National Mall showed up there because they expect to personally benefit from &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221; I doubt a hundred of them would have turned out simply to express pride in their adopted country.</p>
<p>An undercurrent of leftist radicalism and ethnic chauvinism simmered underneath the so-called &#8220;March for America.&#8221; It left me wondering which direction America will take after these people no longer have to put on faux displays of patriotism for access to the welfare state.<br>

		<p>On item 10:  Yea, the LaLouches were also there on the approach walks to the Capital at the start of the TEA party Saturday, complete with OGL as Hitler poster.  They also thrust flyers into everybody&rsquo;s hands face-down to avoid immediate rejection and when turned over, their name was at the title.  Was almost tempted to ball it up and toss it away, but remembered were I was so I stuffed in my pocket till I got to a trashcan.</p>
<p>Since they were also at the open-borders rally I bet they didn&rsquo;t have OGL as Hitler posters.</p>

		<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet.  This is just the beginning.  If White Americans really join forces to stop immigration NOW we can put an end to this nonsense.  Will we do this NOW?  The answer is no.  There should be hundreds or thousands of posts on AmRen.  The fact that there isn&rsquo;t shows that we have a long, long, way to go to wake up the White men and women of this country.  These people are not even citizens.  They have violated our borders with no thought in the least.  They are totally disdainful of our heritage, our culture, our traditions and US.  We can&rsquo;t even get a couple of dozen activists together.  I don&rsquo;t want to be negative about it but, White people are going to have to begin to talk to each other about these very grave problems.  They are going to have to stop fearing the label of &#8220;racist&#8221; and make an attempt to save their country.  Every minute that they delay takes us closer to the precipice.</p>

		<p>As others have stated, Obama&rsquo;s next big push will be for mass legalization of illegal immigrants before the 2012 elections.  If successful, this will rank as a strategic victory for the left comparable to the passage of the health care bill.</p>
<p>Expect the battle over the forthcoming immigration bills to be the one of the nastiest political fights in American history.  It will pit the left, foreign interests, big business, and the neo-conservatives against the true conservatives and the American people.  The only way to defeat the enemy is to treat it as a war, with no holds barred.  The polite, deferential manner typical of most Republicans will surely result in the passage of this bill.</p>

		<p>The tactics of the Radical Soros wing that has taken over the Democrat party (a once patriotic American party), and of the Obama occupation regime, rely heavily on thuggish organizations such as SEIU, ACORN, etc., as well as campus groups. Perhaps, in addition to existing patriotic groups and the Tea Party folks, we also need some young grass-roots organizations   &mdash;  - that would show up at important events, safeguard legitimacy near polling sites, etc. Perhaps these could be recruited from regions of our country still heavily Euro-American. We absolutely need to take control of the borders, show up at radical campus events, stage our own events, create &#8216;shame lists&rsquo; of anti-Americans in positions of influence (in gov&rsquo;t, academia, media etc.) and make sure the Tea Party movement doesn&rsquo;t focus only on fiscal, small government and individual freedom/responsibility matters (important as these are), but also on preventing demographical and cultural replacement. We can&rsquo;t have the image of White anger in this country represented primarily by images of older folks. </p>

		<p>Youth for Western Civilization did an excellent media bypass.  The mainstream media always censors its reportage of left wing demonstrations to hide from the public just how radical and extremist these guys are.  Idiots like Dick Armey, John McCain, and Lindsey Grahamnesty actually think these Che Guevera lovers are going to vote for Republicans.  At least the left wing half of the Democratic party knows what it&rsquo;s doing when it pushes for amnesty   &mdash;   gaining a permanent majority.</p>

		<p>Perhaps because of their youth, or simply due to an overdeveloped sense of optimism, the author and his org haven&rsquo;t yet realized this war is already lost. Can any on you on this site, any of you, honestly see a scenario that will effectively reverse us from this suicidal path we tread? I cannot. Even a bona fide revolution would be put down swiftly and violently. </p>
<p>As was just witnessed with the so-called Healthcare Bill, Washington doesn&rsquo;t care what you think about your own health - can we really fool ourselves to think they will listen regarding this alien invasion that THEY themselves have orchestrated from the ground up? </p>

		<p>Would it be out of line to ask how much these illegal immigrants COST American taxpayers annually&hellip; for welfare supplements, food stamps, of course also for free medical care (E.R. facilities) for themselves their families. Nor can we forget to include the cost of public schooling and even incarceration for those convicted of other crimes in addition to illegal immigration?</p>
<p>I would like to see an UPDATED COST REPORT on AmRen. So I can rub my liberal friends&rsquo; noses in the ugly side of immigration. You know, the side the liberal controlled news media chooses to ignore.</p>

		<p>A very informative report. We often hear about the difficulies in deporting these criminals. &#8220;We can&rsquo;t round up millions&#8221; etc. Thousands is a good place to start. And as for the difficulties claimed to prevent rounding up and deporting these illegals, the police should have started at this demonstration. Looks to me like there would have been no problem. The crowd even separated into national groups under their flags. The INS agents already had them grouped for deportation to where they came from, and where they belong.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine the White outrage if this article were picked up by CBS, NBC, Newsweek, et.al. replete with the 100 pictures of large foreign flags being flown with impunity in the US Capital and video shown on CNN of the marchers trampling on the American flag, carrying racist, anti-American signs about Euro-Americans, and foreign nationals harassing  Roy Beck in his own homeland?</p>
<p>If US Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan read about and saw this going on back in their homeland at the CAPITAL no less, as the government they&rsquo;re &#8216;fighting to protect&rsquo; did nothing, as they risk coming home in a body bag?  Would they not ask themselves if THIS invasion, these foreign people  who are trampling on the American flag, if this is who and what they are &#8216;fighting to protect&rsquo;, risking their lives for as more and more hostile foreign invaders are welcomed by the government?  </p>
<p>Would they not ask themselves why they are risking their lives as hostile, disrespectful, White-hating illegal colonists overtake this country, displace and dispossess NATIVE BORN AMERICAN WHITES and their loves ones all so the invaders can have access to Free White Money?</p>
<p>Would they not (finally) realize WHO is the real enemy of the American people?</p>
<p>I imagine they would feel as the elderly WWII vets do in England and American, those who watch helplessly as the countries they fought to preserve and whose ancestors built are destroyed by unfettered immigration of non-Whites, as they become a hated minority in the country their ancestors built.    </p>
<p>Which other country in the entire world allows Whites to march on its capital flying foreign flags, screaming for the natives to &#8216;get out&rsquo;, demanding &#8216;rights&rsquo; over and above the natives, demand the foreign government hand over its land and treasure the colonists?</p>
<p>I imagine the scene would be akin to Tiananmen Square when the Chinese finally rolled out the tanks and other heavy artillery to put an end to the demonstrations  &mdash;  which left dead anywhere from 10,000 (Russian estimate) to 5,000 (Chinese Red Cross), to 1,000 (Amnesty International)  &mdash;  and the leaders either executed or locked away in prisons.</p>
<p>Yet stories of cotton balls, pictures of nooses and a 16 year old&rsquo;s prank merit the undivided attention of the government, law enforcement, msm, academia and intelligentsia wringing their hands for weeks on end.</p>
<p>Kevin MacDonald is correct when he writes that Whites are being demonized and set up for murderous revenge.</p>

But where are our troops?  Our troops are &hellip;. over there!</p>
<p>We have a critically sick country which could be on its deathbed. Only time will tell.  The sad fact is that <b><i>all the key institutions of our society  </i></b>  &mdash;   the media, academia, etc.  &mdash;   have  ALL been captured by forces hostile to the American majority and turned against it.  There has been an undeclared  anti-majority  war going on for the past half-century.  It has cast all minorities as sacred, and majorities as oppressive and wicked.  But most Americans don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re at war, and the media won&rsquo;t tell them.  It is unmentionable in polite society or public life.  You would be branded as psychotic,  a lunatic if not a moral degenerate. Your career, your reputation, your whole life, would be destroyed for speaking out.  Millions of ordinary people do sense that something is very wrong, but they can&rsquo;t understand what.  </p>
<p>It takes some independent research and original thinking, and most Americans aren&rsquo;t up to that.  They come from work tired, and they&rsquo;d rather just turn on the TV, grab a beer,  and relax. They&rsquo;re not interested in complicated works of  sociologists and historians   &mdash;   scholars like  MacDonald.  Most of them don&rsquo;t even read  (beyond pulp newspapers and celebrity gossip), and they only know what the TV tells them, or talk radio. </p>
<p>This  on-going war against the white Majority has been waged with the help of many well paid  and highly respected  &#8220;useful idiots&#8221;  who have been boosted into influential positions before the public eye. The  groomed and blow-dried pretty faces we see on TV are not the key ideologues who are directing this, and they probably don&rsquo;t have a clue, but they are faithful servants of those in power who employ them,  and they are not going to give up their fat salaries and cushy positions while they sell out the rest of America. I&rsquo;ll grant that many of them won&rsquo;t see it this way, are blind to the problems of middle-class American whites,  and many are doubtless sincerely convinced of the  morality of their views   &mdash;   (so thoroughly brainwashed are they!)   &mdash;   but they are tools and traitors none the less.</p>
<p>Selling out America has been a very profitable occupation for a few.  They can&rsquo;t see what the problem is, or what&rsquo;s wrong with all those  &#8216;angry white males&rsquo; out there    &mdash;    those cranky people in Fly Over Country who are always griping about stuff like jobs and prices and schools.  Who cares about a bunch of dumb rednecks anyway?<br>

If I were an observer from another planet,  speaking neutrally and giving credit where it&rsquo;s due, this has been a very well thought-out and well planned war, cunningly conceived, masterfully conducted. On one side, anyway!  Nothing has been by accident. The majority side, on the other hand, has been confused and disorganized and taken totally off guard by the assault of the militant minorities.  Many majoritarians  don&rsquo;t even know there&rsquo;s a war going on!  When some tiny elements of the majority have tried to mount a feeble resistance,  here or there,  they have been reviled and denounced as racists, bigots, xenophobes, haters &hellip;. not only that, but even moral defectives and mentally ill.  So potent has the smear-word &#8220;racist&#8221; become that it alone will silence most people, and it&rsquo;s virtually guaranteed to remove anyone from public life or even respectable society, and can destroy a career.   In present US society, the pro-minority position is considered &#8220;hip&#8221; and smart, while the majority side is smeared as ignorant and provincial. Standing up for your own is not &#8220;cool&#8221; (unless you&rsquo;re a minority).  Who says so?  The minorities, of course!  They control the discourse.  Even the vocabulary for the discussion is theirs.  The anti-majority forces have a massive arsenal of propaganda entirely on their side, as well as government and all the important social institutions, while any majority representatives or would-be spokesmen are discredited as &#8220;extremists&#8221; and fringe elements. Laughable Archie Bunkers at best.  Hitlers at worst.  And that&rsquo;s in the relatively tolerant USA.  In modern Europe, they are fined into poverty or simply imprisoned and gotten out of the way with no pretense to freedom of thought.  Minority sensitivities are more important than reality or facts, and the truth doesn&rsquo;t count in court.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>THIS is what I have been trying to tell everyone  &mdash;  especially those who believe the &#8216;world, government, or those who are in power are insane&rsquo;  &mdash;  they are not.  They know EXACTLY what they are doing, all of it has been meticulously planned and carried out and they will stop at nothing until their goal is accomplished  &mdash;  a destruction of the American economy (to be replaced by a NWO or One-World, European-Socialist-type government with multi-national hostile elites in control).</p>
<p>We Whites have no place in this plan, as I believe we are harder to control  &mdash;  hence the government&rsquo;s insistence on keeping us atomized, not allowing us to openly advocate for our people, allowing the media and hate groups such as ADL and SPLC to axiomatically label any pro-White group as &#8216;Nazis fomenting a Rise of the Fourth Reich.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Any White who doesn&rsquo;t go along with &#8216;the plan&rsquo; will be persecuted, labeled as a dissident, and perhaps eventually executed as in China and the Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Our dispossession has been done without one shot being fired. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if all Whites have been placated by Soma, or threatened by Big Brother, perhaps both  &mdash;  and remember, in 1984, at the end, Winston Smith declares his love for Big Brother.</p>
<p>The end game of the hostile elites is coming to fruition with the final blows  &mdash;  national health care, which will wipe our the productive classes (do you REALLY believe taxes are only going to be raised on &#8216;those who make $250,000&rsquo;, or $200,000, or whatever the figure is today?)  &mdash;  and a new amnesty for the slave/parasitic class that will effectively guarantee a democratic voting bloc, everywhere, in perpetuity. </p>
<p>As an AmRen poster once warned me:  They understand your psychology better than you do  &mdash;  and have used it successfully against you.</p>
<p>True, true.</p>

This is of course a war against the majority of white Americans and the minorities  - be they non-white Third World immigrants or the native born blacks - are nothing more than foot soliders as part of one offensive against the majority population.  The bigger issue is who is behind those elements of society that are waging the war against the white majority? Who are those that control the government, educational instituations, media, etc. that consistently attack white Americans and traditional American culture? Learn from history, connect the dots, and most importantly, follow the money right back to those that own and control Wall Street and the privately owned Federal Reserve.  What small, powerful, weathly minority group in this country stands to benefit the most from the decline of traditional America? The answer to that question defines the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>That alone is proof of the masterful conduct of this  undeclared &#8220;war&#8221;.  A perfect war!   The most incredible conquest in history.  A bloodless, unannounced take-over of the world&rsquo;s number one super power, from within,  at the height of its strength, without firing a shot!!!</p>
<p>But it was not easy. It took long work and careful planning. This has been a  long, patient war fought with demographics and propaganda,  with psychology instead of weaponry,  and conducted on many levels.  A racial war.  The &#8220;enemy&#8221; (meaning us, the white Majority)  has been almost completely neutralized, its political system taken over and turned against it,  its culture subverted,  its citizenry  divided and confused, and its youth alienated from it.</p>
<p>What conquest could be more perfect than one in which the prize is left completely intact,  ready to fall into the hands of the new rulers, and costing them not a drop of blood?   After all,  who would want to conquer a smoldering ruin, when they could capture the prize intact and fully functional?   We have built it, now someone else will own it.  The rest of the world, uninvolved witnesses to this spectacle (such as Japan and China) must look on in amazement at our self-immolation.  Hirohito, Tojo, could never have dreamed of success like this!<br>
