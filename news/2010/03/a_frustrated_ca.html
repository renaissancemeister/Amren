			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Leahy, Washington Post, March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year ago, members of the Congressional Black Caucus openly wept at Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration. Slowly, that euphoria has given way to frustration that his administration has not done more for black America. Questions about how to elect him have been replaced by questions about how to prod him. </p>
<p>For many, it is the surprise of a political lifetime that they find themselves wrestling with such quandaries. Alternately puzzled and disgruntled, CBC members say key people in the Obama administration have taken them for granted, in the belief that black members of Congress have no stomach for a fight with the country&rsquo;s first black president. </p>
<p>&#8220;We concluded they were just kind of listening to us and that then they would go back [to their offices] and conclude that we would do nothing,&#8221; Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), the vice chairman of the CBC, said of one dispute. &#8220;Because they had concluded there&rsquo;s a black president in the White House and that, to some degree, the Black Caucus, you know, was constrained in expressing its desires. After a while, we said, &#8216;Hey, we see what&rsquo;s going on and it&rsquo;s nothing.&rsquo; &#8221; </p>
<p>On Thursday, CBC members participated in a rare one-hour policy meeting with Obama at the White House to discuss their concerns, most notably their disappointment over a jobs bill that they regard as largely a package of tax breaks for employers, noticeably bereft of job-training programs, new infrastructure projects and summer employment opportunities for youth. Such issues are vital to the CBC, many of whose members represent districts with high levels of unemployment. </p>
<p>In interviews with aides and members afterward, Obama was described as receptive to their message, even though he did not make any large-scale commitments. &#8220;He said he knew what unemployment looks like in &#8216;my own neighborhood in Chicago,&rsquo; &#8221; recounted Cleaver, who stressed that he was speaking only for himself. &#8220;He said he wanted to do things as quickly as possible.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not withstanding Thursday&rsquo;s kind words, the CBC&rsquo;s list of complaints with the White House runs from policy to personal. Despite the caucus&rsquo;s entreaties, the administration has not provided targeted help to black communities and other struggling areas suffering from disproportionately high unemployment, members complain. Many caucus members say they feel largely ignored by key White House advisers. Their communication with Obama himself is minimal to nonexistent. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Several prominent caucus members have expressed doubts about the interest of administration officials in African American issues, referring to figures including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, and senior adviser David Axelrod. They &#8220;haven&rsquo;t had much involvement with minority communities in their careers, said Rep. Donald M. Payne (N.J.). &#8220;They&rsquo;ve been in suites and boardrooms.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For older CBC members, many of whom remember receiving calls from inveterate gabber and advice-seeker Bill Clinton during his presidency, Obama&rsquo;s more distant style has involved adjustments. Asked whether he has received a call from the president since his inauguration, Payne looked up at his office ceiling and answered slowly: &#8220;I can&rsquo;t remember.&#8221; </p>
<p>Members point to the CBC&rsquo;s four committee chairmanships and 18 subcommittee chairmanships as proof of its clout in the House. But several members said they have few African American contacts with substantial sway in the White House. Some caucus members talk wistfully of the last Democratic administration, where the late commerce secretary Ron Brown could relay CBC concerns to Clinton. &#8220;We knew Ron had the president&rsquo;s ear, and he had status,&#8221; Payne said. </p>
<p>White House officials are quick to dispute the notion that there are no African Americans under Obama who have influence. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Mona Sutphen points to Melody Barnes, the head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, and senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett as African Americans with special access to the president. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Caucus member generally take pains to distinguish their misgivings about some of the president&rsquo;s top advisers from their personal commitment to Obama. Cleaver views the prospect of Obama&rsquo;s 2012 reelection campaign as a referendum on the nation&rsquo;s comfort level with an African American at the helm. &#8220;He&rsquo;s got to succeed,&#8221; Cleaver said, emotion putting a catch in his voice. </p>
<p>But Cleaver, Payne and other CBC members acknowledge the paradox they face. How can you express criticism of the administration without eventually confronting the man at the top? </p>
<p>Some say that any public airing of their disagreements with Obama runs the risk of politically damaging the president and ultimately slowing the advancement of other African Americans. &#8220;He&rsquo;s ours. He has to be more careful because he is the first black ever to be president,&#8221; said Rep. Diane Watson (Calif.). &#8220;&hellip; I want to help him, to protect him.&#8221; </p>
<p>Others argue that the president has spent too much time trying to appease Republicans. &#8220;His detractors and political opponents want to try to cast him in the role of being some sort of partisan for African American issues,&#8221; Ellison said. &#8220;I think what he needs to do is just accept the fact that his detractors would say he couldn&rsquo;t swim if he walked on water&hellip; . So why break your neck trying to please them?&#8221; </p>

		<p>Did the Congressional <i>White</i> Caucus have anything to say about this matter?</p>
<p>The very fact that the controlled Imperial governmedia see nothing out of the ordinary in an explicitly black group of lawmakers   &mdash;   while at the same time screaming &#8220;Racism!&#8221; at the smallest sign of White racial awareness   &mdash;   is the <i>real</i> scandal in this story.<br>

		<p>CBC:  Prove that you&rsquo;re for real.  Don&rsquo;t endorse Obama in 2012. </p>
<p>Otherwise, I will be forced to think that it&rsquo;s all a rope-a-dope trick on the part of both you and the White House to make the President appear like some kind of moderate.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A year ago, members of the Congressional Black Caucus openly wept at Barack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration. Slowly, that euphoria has given way to frustration that his administration has not done more for black America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not done more&#8221; for black America runs the gamut from awarding each black $100,000 as reparations to installing hundreds in positions of power and pretending they&rsquo;re qualified, just as they do when one of them has somebody write a book for him, then declare he&rsquo;s the author.</p>
<p>Al Sharpton is trying to keep all this black criticism down by letting them know of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;low key&#8221; work that favors blacks, like the mandates in the healthcare bill that will force Med schools to fill black quotas despite their lack of qualifications and ability to do the work&hellip;..AA will take care of that&hellip;&hellip;.and other &#8220;undercover&#8221; efforts by the pro-black community organizer.</p>
<p>These blacks will NEVER be satisfied with anything no matter how much they are freely given, and you can bet that they will show absolutely no gratitude at all at anything that was generously awarded to them, instead claiming they received what the did as a result of their own abilities and efforts.</p>

		<p>White Americans have expressed concern that Obama would not advance their concerns.  Fair enough.  He&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>Now blacks are finding that he is not offering them a magical toy box, either.</p>
<p>The problem is that Obama has always thought of himself more as a world citizen rather than an American or a Black American, etc.</p>
<p>He is a globalist, and this is the community activist in him speaking.  He has big ideas of crossing barriers across nations, blah, blah blah.</p>
<p>In the end, he won&rsquo;t do anything for anybody and he will be a one term president who will be remembered for nice speeches and little else.</p>

		<p>I heard a couple of days ago that the community-organizer-in-chief has made it possible for all black men to go to college right out of high school.   Havent searched for it and I havent seen anything else to validate that, but I did hear it on the news and directly called my dad about it to see if he heard it too.</p>
<p>He told me nothing surprises him anymore in this Nation.  He said &#8216;This is what the White People of this Nation want. If I knew this years ago I wouldnt have fought in the war&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Your president is planning to visit this part of the world soon (OZ/NZ). I don&rsquo;t think there will be too much sleep lost or sad faces here if he has to cancel the trip so that he can attend  to his free healthcare debate back home.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame blacks for being upset that a black politician is doing little to help them, just as I don&rsquo;t blame my fellow WNs for holding treacherous white elites accountable.</p>
<p>However, blacks should just accept that B.O is not going to advance a black agenda. If any black person actually read the &#8220;Audacity of Hope,&#8221; they would realize that Saint Obama is a centrist people pleaser and won&rsquo;t actually advocate &#8220;social justice.&#8221; </p>
<p>Besides, I think we all know what would happen if Barack hoisted the red, black, and green flag over the White House, pushed for reparations, and attempted to &#8220;paint the White House black.&#8221; Even though most whites are apathetic and unwilling to assert themselves, many would literally run Obama out of office. </p>
<p>Obama will continue enjoy monolithic black support (He still has a 90% approval rating among blacks). However, unless he picks up more of the white vote, he will be remembered as a one-and-done president known only for his heartwarming rhetoric. </p>
<p>Which party shall I vote for in 2012? The Democrats are our enemy, and the Republicans are no better (as evidenced by token Michael Steele and their unwillingness to tackle immigration). What to do?</p>

What to do?? Who to vote for in 2012??<br>
I do not fully understand the USA electoral system, but as far as I can tell there is little or no place for a minor, or any other party, as an alternative to Dem or Rep. Is this the situation?</p>
<p>Amren &amp; New Century must work to achieve popular support and get real political representation before it is to late for the America we once all knew.</p>
<p>The alternative, be like the whites in South Africa. If you can&rsquo;t emmigrate to Australia you live in a gated community, carry a gun and it&rsquo;s every man for himself.</p>

Another fun fact from the New York Times&rsquo;s proxy: Senior executives can get an extra bonus for hiring minorities and women instead of white guys. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the text: </p>
<p>The [Compensation] Committee also retained the discretion to increase or decrease the individual component of the total bonus paid to each executive by up to 10% based on the continuing development of a diverse work force, including the inclusion of diverse candidates in hiring processes and the demonstration of personal commitment to diversity through participation in diversity-related activities, such as mentoring and sponsorship of affinity groups. </p>
<p>And how did NYTCO&rsquo;s senior management do on this category of potential bonus for this year? </p>
<p>Chairman Arthur Sulzberger didn&rsquo;t get any extra <br>
Neither did CEO Janet Robinson <br>
But Michael Golden, CEO of NYTCo&rsquo;s &#8220;regional media group&#8221; got an extra 5%. </p>
