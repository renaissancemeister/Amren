<h1>Costly Racial Case Roils DeKalb</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, DeKalb County taxpayers have spent $2.53 million to defend against a long-running discrimination lawsuit, in which three white employees of DeKalb&rsquo;s parks department claim they were unfairly shunted aside in favor of black employees. A fourth plaintiff, a black man, claims he was punished for opposing the action against the white workers.</p>
<p>The trial concluded on Tuesday afternoon with testimony by former DeKalb CEO Vernon Jones, who is a defendant, and the case is expected to go to the jury today.</p>
<p>On top of the millions DeKalb has already spent on the case  &mdash;  and the latest accounting was only through January  &mdash;  it likely will have to spend millions more if the county loses. That&rsquo;s because the plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyers, who include former state Attorney General Mike Bowers and former DeKalb District Attorney J. Tom Morgan, will ask the court to order the county to pay their fees if their side prevails  &mdash;  in addition to any damages awarded to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prolonged litigation has been bitterly contested by both sides. The frustration of plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyers, who have accused the county of withholding evidence, boiled over Tuesday when they filed an extraordinary motion to strike the county&rsquo;s defenses, which would leave the jurors with nothing to do but decide how much the county must pay in damages.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the trial, plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys have argued that top county officials orchestrated a scheme to force out white managers and replace them with blacks. According to testimony, the number of higher-paid black officials in DeKalb increased by 82 percent from the time Jones took office in January 2001 to August 2005, while the number of higher-paid white officials declined by about 6 percent during the same period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Jones took office, Becky Kelley had worked for DeKalb&rsquo;s parks department for 25 years and was its director beginning in 1992. She testified that almost from the outset Jones was hostile toward her. During one meeting in his office, she told jurors, Jones jumped out of his chair and stepped toward her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said she was later told by Jones&rsquo; executive assistant, Richard Stogner, that she did not understand &#8220;the geopolitical situation&#8221; in DeKalb and that she was unable to work with powerful black men. Even though Kelley got a stellar job review, she said she believed she was losing her authority to her new black deputy director.</p>

<p>Even if one could make the case that DeKalb County were as white run county as nearby Forsyth (14 Don&rsquo;t Let The Sun Set on Your A Double S) County, GA  prior to the appointment of this Jones to county manager and even if Dekalb County were 70% Black, the only logical inference is that this 14 member Dekalb&rsquo;s total county bureaucracy with his bro&rsquo;s by a factor of 2 during his reign. The only matter unclear to an outside reader is that which deals with how and from whom the taxes were extracted to do this.</p>

<p>Orchestrated a scheme? Everywhere else in the world they just pass Laws against white men and enshrine it with an accompanying &#8216;diversity statement&rsquo; and then call the whole thing tolerance and enlightenment. </p>
<p>This whole incident and especially the coverage in the media really makes no sense. There&rsquo;s no fear whites are going to riot or revolt. That much is plainly obvious. </p>

		<p>If the county is primarily black, the whites probably need to step aside so the blacks can create their own ruin.  And they will - that&rsquo;s a guarantee.  Unfortunately, white people these days need to be able to read the handwriting on the wall:  &#8220;Meni, meni, tekel upharsin&#8221; now means &#8220;This county is getting too dark for you, white guys, so move to a better area!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>   I have lived in DeKalb Count for over 30 years- most of my adult life. Dekalb has gone from being one of the most desirable places to live in the U.S.( fourth rated public school system in the country in 1972)  to a typical black run debacle.  County politics have devolved into some kind of twisted Amos n Andy sitcom.  This lawsuit is the tip of a giant iceberg of financial disasters stemming from corruption in the county, much of which began with Vernon Jones.  He was imitating his mentors in Fulton County who got in trouble a few years ago for firing a lot of white employees of the library system in an effort to darken the county workplace.  BTW the whites sued and won, costing Fulton County taxpayers plenty.  The good news is all of these counties are out of money, squandered in the boom years.  Now we sit back and watch the rest of the show. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived outside Atlanta for 17 years - I wouldn&rsquo;t live in Fulton or DeKalb county because of exactly this sort of thing. The maddening part is that most of the tax dollars used to defend the actions of corrupt black officials was probably paid by white taxpayers. We can&rsquo;t win. Large black populations are a disaster.</p>

		<p>Vernon Jones lost, but the plaintiffs were awarded less than ten percent of what the case cost the taxpayers:</p>
