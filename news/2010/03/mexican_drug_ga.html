<h1>Mexican Drug Gang to Blame for Killings of US Consulate Workers </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A suspected Mexican drug gang gunned down two cars carrying families with ties to the U.S. consulate on Saturday, killing an American couple and a Mexican man in the country&rsquo;s deadliest city.</p>
<p>Three young children survived the shoot-out in Ciudad Juarez, including the couple&rsquo;s baby, who was found crying in the backseat of their vehicle.</p>
<p>The pair were identified as consular employee Lesley A. Enriquez, 35, and her husband, Arthur H. Redelfs, 34. Redelfs was a detention officer at the El Paso County Jail. The third person killed was identified as the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate.</p>
<p>The killings, which occurred in broad daylight, came amid a surge in bloodshed along Mexico&rsquo;s border with Texas and drew condemnation from the White House. Mexico&rsquo;s president expressed outrage and promised a fast investigation to find those responsible.</p>
<p>The State Department authorized U.S. government employees at Ciudad Juarez and five other U.S. consulates in northern Mexico to send family members out of the area because of concerns about rising drug violence. The cities are Tijuana, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative that U.S. citizens understand the risks in Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and who to contact if victimized,&#8221; the department said in a statement issued Sunday.</p>
<p>Authorities put suspicion on members of a gang of hit men allied with the Juarez drug cartel. That theory is based on &#8220;information exchanged with U.S. federal agencies&#8221; helping in the investigation, according to a statement Sunday from the joint mission of soldiers and federal police overseeing security in Ciudad Juarez.</p>
<p>While putting the blame on the drug gang, police offered no information on a possible motive in the slayings. U.S. State Department spokesman Fred Lash said only that the three dead people were at the same party before the attacks that occurred minutes apart Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Several U.S. citizens have been killed in Mexico&rsquo;s drug war, most of them people with family ties to Mexico. It is very rare for American government employees to be targeted, although attackers hurled grenades at the U.S. consulate in the northern city of Monterrey in 2008.</p>
<p>Lash said the decision was based not only on Saturday&rsquo;s killings but also on a wider pattern of violence and threats in northern Mexico in recent weeks. The State Department noted the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City has advised American citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of the Mexican states of Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ten minutes before that killing, police in another part of the city found the body of the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate.</p>
<p>Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37, a Mexican citizen, was shot to death in his car, while his two children, ages 4 and 7, were wounded, according to the state prosecutors office. The children were hospitalized.</p>
<p>Civilians have increasingly gotten caught in the middle of drug gang violence that has made Ciudad Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world, with more than 2,500 people killed last year alone.</p>
<p>The three died during a particularly bloody weekend in Mexico, with nearly 50 people killed in apparent gang violence. Nine people were killed in a gang shootout early Sunday in the Pacific resort city of Acapulco, one of Mexico&rsquo;s spring break attractions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The office of Mexican President Felipe Calderon&rsquo;s office said he &#8220;expresses his indignation&#8221; and &#8220;his sincerest condolences to the families of the victims&#8221; of Saturday&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>Calderon &#8220;reiterated the Mexican government&rsquo;s unwavering compromise to resolve these grave crimes,&#8221; his office said.</p>

		<p>Resolve these crimes your behind!!  What needs to happen is for the U.S. to send some of the members of the finest fighting force on the globe - the U.S. Marines - in for a &#8220;final solution&#8221; to Mexico&rsquo;s drug cartel problem.  THEN they need to go after the oligarchy that controls Mexico behind the scenes, send THEM on to their higher good, and put the country under martial law.  After they establish a system of government that allows the common people to have land, work, and prosper, they can say &#8220;mission accomplished&#8221; and come on back home as heroes.  And, with Mexico in good hands, our illegals would go home!!!</p>

		<p>I suspect these &#8220;Americans&#8221; are mostly Mexicans or other Hispanics that are actively involved with drug gang activity, in one way or another.  I highly doubt that Mexican drug gangs would just mow down white Americans just for the heck of it   &mdash;   they would be more likely to kidnap them and ask for ransom.</p>

A news report I saw today had the number of homicides in Juarez in 2009 as high as 3,600.  If these numbers are accurate, Juarez makes New Orleans and Detroit look like nursery schools.</p>

		<p>What a scam. Why won&rsquo;t the state dept. warn against travelling to parts of Detroit, Baltimore, D.C., Durham, Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, Houston, etc.?</p>
<p>Why pick on the Mexicans? We have enough afrovoodoo aliens amongst us committing more robbing, raping and murdering than the Mexicans are.  What does the state dept. know that they are keeping secret from us?  Are they keeping their jobs by not mentioning the real threats?  Are they under the thumb of sensitivity, tolerance, inclusion, and Diversity?</p>
<p>How many more will die because of the silence?</p>
<p>When can we get our race reparations paid for the murders of Julie Love, Emily Haddock, Kristen Warneke, Channon Christian, Eugenia Calle, Anne Pressley, and all the White American Citizen police officers killed in cold blood by afrovoodoo thugs?</p>
<p>When all our great great grandchildren are dark skinned mongrels with slight blond highlights in their hair, sort of a reddish color, will they be shamed by the taint of our white blood in their veins because we dared ask such insensitive and racist questions?  Will they curse our White names?</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t contact anyone (not by normal means, anyway) when you&rsquo;re dead.  :(</p>
<p>I used to go work occasionally in Juarez, but I quit the company that was sending me there in 1999.  I usually have wished I had not quit, since it was a good job, but after hearing about all the violence, maybe it saved my life.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an urgent message making it around the internet via email that Mexico is on the brink of catastrophe, more than the usual warnings.</p>
<p>Although the gangs are still fighting each other, they DO have certain territories, carving up Mexico into various cartel domains, and any one&hellip;.or more&hellip;of those could fall to the king pins in control.</p>
<p>These cartel leaders build hospitals and other necessities in their districts, offer employment, and are well thought of by the average every day person.  Kind of like the model that Pablo Escobar set in Columbia where he was fast becoming more powerful than the government, until he became over confident and tried to take over the entire legislature before he had more power to do so.  </p>
<p>Any kind of cartel takeover will mean disaster for the US militarily, domographically and, especially, economically.  With the second shoe about to fall on the residential and commercial mortgage markets, such an occurrence at this time would certainly mean the end of this country as we know it and a beginning of large scale chaos and upheaval on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Just when it starts to look as if things can&rsquo;t get worse they do.</p>

<p>Only NOW is there a realization that these cities are as dangerous as DEADtroit! Those cities have been deadly dangerous since, at least, the early 70s when cocaine was becoming a big thing. I said before and now again, there is no reason for drug cartels to exist, we (U.S. military) KNOW WHO THEY ARE we (U.S.Military) KNOW WHERE THEY ARE so let&rsquo;s take the gloves off and let our SOGs do what I personally know they love to do.</p>

		<p>Drugs have to be made legal and taxed to have them under government control rather than criminal control. The profit could go to education and medical needs of the drug addicts. The war on drugs is causing too many innocents to be murdered and ruining an entire nation.</p>

		<p>Why is it so difficult for people to understand that we will alwys have drug addicts,but we don&rsquo;t have to have the violence associated with the huge sums involved due to its illegality?<br>
LEGALIZE IT! and end this ridiculous &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; which is really just a war on liberty and on safety.<br>
Think about it,how often do we see shootouts tied to alcohol distribution?<br>
When was the last time that you saw Heineken reps having turf wars with Budweiser over their products?<br>
Can we stop this insanity?<br>
I guess too many DEA agents are receiving paychecks,perks and pensions for that to happen any time soon.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care what they do in Mexico. They could blow the entire population of Mexico off the map if they want. It&rsquo;s not our country. Americans who go to other countries, especially if it&rsquo;s a widely known drug run nation, must know that they&rsquo;re taking their chances. Our job is to watch and protect our border (which we don&rsquo;t), send back illegals (which we don&rsquo;t), prosecute drug smugglers and their pocket-padding American helpers (which we don&rsquo;t).</p>

		<p>11 Schoolteacher:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finding out that the Americans killed were law enforcement officials embedded with Mexican &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; under the Merida Initiative.  Now, we don&rsquo;t know if they were white or Hispanic or what, but since Mexican &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; is hopelessly corrupt, embedding an American cop in a Mexican cop camp is pretty much handing them over to the drug cartels for execution.  This was an act of terrorism.  It was also a message from the drug cartels to the American government.  I got the message   &mdash;   build the border wall now.</p>

		<p>Yes, Legalize drugs.  Here in Colorado, Medical Marijuana is now &#8220;legal&#8221;.  So are the growing operations.  Guess what?  Someone is now growing Dope in a barn about 1000 feet from my back door, and I live in the country!  Some days, all of his &#8216;patients&rsquo; show up simultaneously, for some unknown reason.  You should see it! Blacks, Mexicans, Long-hairs, women with dark rings around their eyes (they all have those)&hellip;.I moved here to get away from all the crowds.  Now they drive past my house daily in an endless, frightening stream.  When they legalize meth, please:  Let them set up their lab in YOUR back yard!</p>
