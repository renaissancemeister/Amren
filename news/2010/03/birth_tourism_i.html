			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Işıl Eğrikavuk, Hürriyet Daily News (Istanbul), March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s 1982 hit &#8220;Born in the USA&#8221; were to become popular again, the title might now refer to thousands of Turkish children whose parents are increasingly traveling to the United States to give birth.</p>
<p>According to tourism expert Gürkan Boztepe and media sources, 12,000 Turkish children have been born in the U.S. since 2003.The numbers are significant enough to draw the attention of tourism companies and inspire them to pursue &#8220;birth tourism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a company on the Internet and decided to go to Austin for our child&rsquo;s birth,&#8221; said Selin Burcuoğlu who gave birth to a daughter last year. &#8220;It was incredibly professional. They organized everything for me. I had no problem adjusting and I had an excellent birth,&#8221; she told the Hürriyet Daily News &amp; Economic Review.</p>
<p>Burcuoğlu said she and her partner chose to have the birth in the U.S. to make their child&rsquo;s life more comfortable. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want her to deal with visa issues  &mdash;  American citizenship has so many advantages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birth tourism</p>
<p>Burcuoğlu is not the only Turkish parent who wants her child to have U.S. citizenship. Many Turkish parents-to-be are now seeking tourism companies to &#8220;guarantee&#8221; their child&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have been involved in medical tourism since 2002,&#8221; said Levent Baş, general manager of Gurib Tourism. &#8220;But we were also receiving so many demands about this issue that we decided to sell birth packages,&#8221; he told the Daily News.</p>
<p>&#8220;We first started our research in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Orlando and we only contacted Turkish doctors,&#8221; Baş said. &#8220;But we are preparing a package that covers everything from the flight and city tours to accommodation for several months and hospital expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of cost, Baş said the minimum expense is $25,000, which rises to $40,000 if the destination is New York.</p>
<p>Birth tourism organizations are located throughout Turkey, including one run by Gürkan Boztepe in the Aegean province of İzmir. &#8220;Before, only celebrities gave birth in the U.S. We are now aiming, however, to make this service accessible to everyone. And surprisingly, our customers are not just from İzmir and Istanbul, there are also many people from smaller provinces, such as [southeastern] Gaziantep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many families, however, do not want to talk openly about the process, according to the birth tourism operators. &#8220;Many people say they are doing it because they want their kids to get a cheaper education and not deal with visa issues when they grow up,&#8221; said Baş.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they don&rsquo;t want to make it public. Even celebrities who have done this are trying to ignore the issue by saying they had to give birth in the U.S. because their doctors were there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Arzu Geiger is an entrepreneur who lives in Gilbert, Arizona, and offers customers the option to stay in her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got the idea when a friend of ours wished to give birth in the U.S.,&#8221; she told the Daily News. &#8220;We realized that many women abroad may also wish to give birth in the U.S., but may have many concerns regarding arrangements or safety. Some women may choose to stay alone with us for the first few months, then move to separate living arrangements when family members arrive for the birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the small-scale companies have started investing in the birth market, bigger firms are also entering the market with alternative packages. The Turkish-owned Marmara Hotel group recently announced a birth tourism package that includes accommodation at their Manhattan branch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hosted 15 families last year,&#8221; said Nur Ercan Mağden, head manager of The Marmara Manhattan, adding that the cost was $45,000 each.</p>
<p>Law Amendment</p>
<p>According to the U.S.&rsquo;s 14th Amendment, the country grants citizenship to anyone born on its soil. At the same time, however, many have demanded the elimination of the &#8220;ius soli&#8221; law.</p>
<p>&#8220;They come to this country and have babies. The children are citizens. The children are eligible to go to school. They receive food stamps and social programs. The American taxpayers are paying for it,&#8221; said Republican Congressman Gary Miller last month, who is co-sponsoring a bill that seeks to abolish birthright citizenship for children born in the country to illegal immigrant parents.</p>
<p>According to Emre Özgü, a partner at law firm Barst Mukamal &amp; Kleiner LLP in New York, people in favor of tightening immigration laws have been attempting to end &#8220;ius soli&#8221; citizenship for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those trying to restrict immigration argue these babies, who are occasionally called &#8216;anchor babies,&rsquo; serve as a key link in the &#8216;chain immigration&rsquo; process that they would like to see eliminated. However, there is no current pending legislation before Congress that would limit the claim to U.S. citizenship of a child born in the U.S.,&#8221; Özgü told the Daily News.</p>
<p>When asked whether birthright citizenship could be considered a loophole in the law, Özgü said he would not classify the &#8220;ius soli&#8221; citizenship as such because it is explicitly included within the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it can be controversial, birth tourism is legal in the U.S.,&#8221; said Geiger. &#8220;Some of the major concerns expressed with birth tourism are that the mother and baby can access free health and social benefits at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. We do not accept customers in this manner  &mdash;  they are responsible for the payment of their own medical expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baş, however, thinks U.S. authorities are ultimately unconcerned by the practice. &#8220;I think the United States is aware of such a law, otherwise they would prevent it. I think it is part of an integration policy. They want people to become American citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other examples</p>
<p>Birth tourism to the U.S. is not just popular in Turkey but also in Asian countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. According to a Los Angeles Times report, many South Korean parents-to-be have chosen to give birth in the U.S. for many reasons, ranging from a desire to enroll their children in American schools to enabling them to avoid South Korean military service.</p>
<p>The birthright citizenship formerly applied to other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia but both countries modified their law in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>India maintained such birthright law until 2004, but ended the right to prevent continued illegal immigration from neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh.<br>

These new Americans in name only are undoubtedly Muslim.  They don&rsquo;t speak English, they never pay taxes, they know nothing about our history or traditions.  But they have the same citizenship rights as you and me.<br>
BTW, birth tourism from Korea has been going on for many years.</p>

		<p>This sort of thing has been going for a long time.  Koreans have been doing this for years.  It&rsquo;s high time we eliminated birthright citizenship not only for children of illegal immigrants but for children born to short term visitors.<br>

		<p>Personally I object to any immigration and especially object to muslim immigration, legal or otherwise. The muslims are going to bring more hardship, to include outright warfare, to our country. Just ask our military and our civilian contractors in the Muddled East how the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221; conducts itself on it&rsquo;s own land&hellip;in Kuwait and Saudi the ruling families (NOT GOVERNMENTS) ruthlessly control everything for themselves (not unlike our congress) and we in the U.S. can expect the treatment of slaves because it will be convert, be a slave or die, there are no other options for a non muslim.</p>

		<p>Reading this article made me mad.  Especially about South Koreans wanting their children to avoid military service.  We give them protection from North Korea with our own blood and treasure, and what do they do?  Skip out on the responsibility to defend themselves.  Without our help, they probably would all be under the thumb of Kim Jong-Il or some other communist thug.</p>
<p>We need to end birthright citizenship, and end it now.  If not that, at least no benefits for non-US parents of US born children.  I would go as far to say that both parents must be citizens to give full benefits to them and their children.  Otherwise, they are not deserving.  It burns me up to see my country given away like this.</p>
<p>I will make sure to contact my Congresscritters soon and make sure they know where I stand (as if that will do anything, I know, at least not with our Democrat Senators here in Florida).</p>

		<p>So, why don&rsquo;t we institute a FEE of, say, $25,000 or more, for each child of foreign parents born on our soil?  That&rsquo;d stop the poor from dropping kids here and sucking our welfare system dry, and it wouldn&rsquo;t stop the wealthy parents - so maybe we can get them to &#8220;stay and pay&#8221; taxes here too.</p>

		<p>We need a reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment. An end to automatic citizenship for all babies born on American soil. Turks and Koreans in the US are not really a problem  &mdash;  their numbers are small and their quality high (unlike the the Turks in Europe). It&rsquo;s really the Mexican anchor-baby problem that must be addressed.</p>

		<p>This is amazing. The numbers are small though compared to the millions that are coming from Latin America. </p>
<p>My guess on the Turks is that they are not very Islamic, and in fact are planning to escape from an increasingly Islamic Turkey. Of course, they could also be part of some rich Muslim&rsquo;s bizarre plan to seed radicals in the USA and build up business/religious networks here !!!</p>
<p>It is amazing how non-Whites are planning for their future quite well, while we seem to be stumbling.  Hopefully, the PLE projects can become more numerous and successful&hellip;we need our own networks too.</p>

		<p>   We have enough Muslim immigrants in my college town to have a Mosque. I have no idea how many are illegal, but I suspect more than a few. The MSM claim Islam is the fastest growing religion in America. Of course, this is almost totally due to our insane immigration policy. </p>

		<p>Beware of the Turks! My home country Germany has the doubtful honor of hosting the largest Turkish expat community in the world (approx. 3 million). They are experts when it comes to abusing hospitality. Unfortunately, as most of them are naturalized citizens (thanks to our treacherous government) we are literally stuck with them. Once a considerable number of Turks has managed to gain a foothold in the US, they are likely to bring their large extended families here and you can brace yourselves for an unprecedented &#8220;reproduction tsunami&#8221;. Turkish people tend to foster an aggressive nationalism, coupled with devout Muslim religiosity. Additionally, they are steeped in their archaic traditions of family honor. You think black Americans and Mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are unruly, well the Turks take moral depravity to a whole new level. The concept of honor killings is even more widespread among Turkish families than it is with Arab Muslims, to the point were it is considered common practice, an appropriate means of calling uncouth daughters who violate the holy tenets of Islam by dating an unworthy westerner or behaving like a western &#8220;whore&#8221; to order, once and for all.                                             <br>
Reports about honor killings, inbreeding and perverted notions of morality in the Turkish community are running rampant even in the left-leaning German mainstream media, because those facts can no longer be concealed from the public. The crime stats in every major German city are dominated by Turkish youths, most of them recidivists with several previous convictions. Education means nothing to them. All attempts to integrate them into German society have miserably failed, but of course, self-proclaimed spokespeople of the Turkish immigrant community never fail to remind us that their shortcomings are all attributable to the pervasive racism inherent in German society and that we have to remunerate them anyways for rebuilding Germany in the aftermath of the second world war (interestingly, the first non-European guest workers arrived in the latter half of the 1960s, but logic does not seem to be a typical Turkish trait).<br>
I have rarely met people with a greater sense of entitlement, a freeloading mentality that would make even hardcore scroungers from other third-world countries blush with shame, and such a striking feeling of superiority towards the &#8220;infidel aboriginees&#8221; who subsidize them and their families and are afforded not only ingratitute but heartfelt contempt for their western &#8220;indulgences&#8221;, ignobility and sissy mentality. The proneness of the Turkish to commit violent crimes and throw temper tantrums if they don`t get it their way are also legendary all over Europe.<br>
Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to warn you about the evil that is heading your way. The Turks alone managed to ruin the public welfare system in Germany, and trust me, Obamacare plus a large scale influx of Turks into your country is tantamount to ringing the financial death knell.</p>

Germany (the Netherlands, Denmark, etc.) got the wrong Turks  &mdash;  you got villagers from the East, most of whom quickly decided that they were really Kurds, when you let the PKK press them. It&rsquo;s foolish to import uneducated manual labor  &mdash;  their children grow up bitter and maladjusted. <br>
These &#8220;birth tourists&#8221; from Turkey are paying tens of thousands of dollars for the opportunity. These are members of the cosmopolitan upper middle class, not backwards villagers. Frank Salter is certainly right  &mdash;  that we should promote immigration only from our closest genetic neighbors  &mdash;  but Turks are not that different genetically (lots of blue eyes in Istanbul!) and these immigrants will certainly not be a drain on taxpayers.<br>

		<p>avertculturaldemise, it is the United States government that keeps pressuring the European Union to add Turkey to the club.  It does this because Turkey is a NATO ally.  (Me, I don&rsquo;t care who is in NATO so long as the United States gets out of it.)  You can see this as yet another unwanted consequence of the American military empire.<br>

A lot of my Turkish aquaintances pertain to the so-called cosmopolitan upper-middle class. All of them are decent people who have been residing in Germany for more than 20 years, but none of them would identify as a German-Turk. They will never sever their ties with the homeland, that is were their loyalities lie. The Turkish government relentlessly pursues the goal of roping in the members of this intellectual vanguard of Turks living abroad for lobbying and infiltration purposes. Prime minister Erdogan is quite eager to prevent any nation from dredging up dirty little secrets about the Ottoman Empire or addressing issues that might tarnish the repution of Turkey. The US-Congress recently condemned the genocide against the Armenians, something that is entirely unthinkable in European nations with a considerable Turkish population, for fear of violent outburst and rioting. The Turkish government currently wields enough political influence in the Netherlands and Germany to muzzle its critics there. <br>
No matter how well-integrated Turkish upper-class families in Europe or the US may seem, blood is always thicker than water. Besides, most cases of honor killings so far occurred in allegedly assimilated middle-/upper class families (shopkeepers, doctors, lawyers) and not in skid-row families imported from the Anatolian heartland. It is pretty easy to keep a tally of those heinous crimes, there is at least one incident every three months (in Germany).<br>
One recent attempt of the Turkish government to extend its influence in Europe is reported here <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,684125,00.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,684125,00.html</a></p>

<p>-&gt;Wrong. At most, 1 Mil, both with Turkish and/or German citizenships. The rest are made up by Arabs, Kurds, Armenians and other non Ethnic Turks from Turkey.</p>
<p>The crime stats in every major German city are dominated by Turkish youths, most of them recidivists with several previous convictions.</p>
<p>-&gt;If you look at statistics, crime per capita is far higher in other nationalities such as Lebanese, Balkan people, Eastern Europeans etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The concept of honor killings is even more widespread among Turkish families than it is with Arab Muslims.</p>
<p>-&gt;Common practice? Did you check where they are/were from? I&rsquo;m extremely sure they are mostly from the Eastern regions of Turkey&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
Devout religiosity? </p>
<p>-&gt;Have you ever heard that Republic of Turkey is a SECULAR state? The only secular majority Muslim country in the world?</p>
<p>an appropriate means of calling uncouth daughters who violate the holy tenets of Islam by dating an unworthy westerner or behaving like a western &ldquo;whore&rdquo; to order, once and for all.</p>
<p>-&gt; So, why are you going crazy when you see a white woman with a non-white man? I wouldn&rsquo;t allow my children to date Westerners as well, what is wrong with that?</p>
<p>As always, a confused German who can&rsquo;t distinguish an Arab, Turk and Kurd, since over 40 years! <br>
When will you learn not every dark haired guy/girl is NOT Turkish? Have you ever left Germany?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting sick of it.</p>

<p>Turks are not that different genetically (lots of blue eyes in Istanbul!) </p>
<p>I posted it many times but seems I have to repeat it:<br>
Why are you surprised? My grandfathers were both tall, blond and blue eyed (no, not slaves or some other immigrant, I can trace it back up to six generations).</p>
<p>Turks were the easternmost Caucasian people in Asia, in my opinion, they mixed on their ways to West Asia but original individuals may still be found in the distant parts of Anatolia (clearly Caucasian, nothing Asiatic).</p>

		<p>The only way to stop birth tourism is to stop handing out citizenship that&rsquo;s solely based on &#8220;ius solis.&#8221; Anybody who would have a child merely to guarantee their place in any country is committing child abuse. </p>

The Turks are right about the &#8220;Armenian Genocide&#8221;  &mdash;  WWI propaganda, which we swallowed hook, line, and sinker, because of sympathy with our Armenian Christian co-religionists. Please consult any of the works of Justin McCarthy for a fair and balanced view.<br>
Honor killing (in Denmark anyway) is much more likely among Pakistanis or Iraqis (some of them Turkomen) than among Turks. Secular Turks condemn honor killing as strongly as you or I.<br>
But, overall, I have to agree with your main point: Turks are remarkably nationalistic, and remain devoted to Turkey for at least the second generation. Kind of like the Irish!</p>

Crime is still higher among immigrant groups, including Turks, than native Germans, which makes a case for more restricted immigration to Germany. </p>

 <br>
Yes, I agree completely. Turks are Caucasian not Asians and are of the Mediterranean or Alpine sub groupings of the white race.  Turks tend to be more religious outside the capitol Istanbul, but they are still less religious than the Arabs.  <br>

The blond and blue-eyed Turks you refer to are probably descended from Balkanese people who where abducted and brought to Asia Minor after the Ottoman Conquest. I fully agree that Turks are Caucasians, but they are certainly not white in the European sense of the word.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard that Republic of Turkey is a SECULAR state? The only secular majority Muslim country in the world?</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Turkey`s secularity has been on steady decline ever since the death of Atatürk, and the vast majority of Turks is apparently not interested in upholding his concept of laicist statehood, otherwise Erdogan and his Islamist AKP would never have scored land-slide victories in the national elections. Turkey a secular Muslim state - no more! Besides, secular and Muslim is a contradiction in itself, Islam is an all-encompassing ideology!</p>
<p><br>
As always, a confused German who can&rsquo;t distinguish an Arab, Turk and Kurd, since over 40 years! <br>
When will you learn not every dark haired guy/girl is NOT Turkish? Have you ever left Germany?</p>
<p>- Did you logically deduce this from my post applying your magic clairvoyance powers? Who says that I`m unable to tell apart Turks from Arabs or Kurds? If you don`t want to be lumped in with those &#8220;non-ethnic&#8221; Turks, than why do you insist that they remain part of your nation. Palming off the responsibility for the actions of your compatriots abroad on ethnic minorities, whose territories had been annexed by Turkey, is an easy cop-out!</p>

<p>Sorry, you are wrong again. I have many blond and blue-eyed people in my extended family, none of them are of Balkan descent, completely Anatolian Turkish. Read my post carefully and do not believe in garbage history and myths. </p>
<p>These people live in the moste remote parts of the country and never intermarry with city people (they are still semi-nomadic).</p>

<p>Cute, isn&rsquo;t she? :)</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t make them white as white means European and Turks are certainly not. But it&rsquo;s wrong to assume that every light pigmented Turk is of foreign descent. Even the first country with the suffix &#8220;Turk&#8221; in Central Asia had the name &#8220;Gok-Turk&#8221;. Gok means blue and they were described &#8220;brown haired, blue eyed&#8221; Turks by the Chinese&hellip; There are still remnants of these people in Mongolia, probably in the region in which Heinrich Himmler of Nazi Germany once interested.<br>

<p>-&gt;Yes and unfortunately the EU has directly or indirectly contributed to their victory by supporting bogus democracy in Turkey, especially by left-wing and liberal Euro parties who hate our army and its secular and republican stand. However, although the people became more religious, they are not becoming fundamentalist Muslims, just more conservative and traditional but not Arab-alike. A large portion of us aren&rsquo;t religious to which I belong.</p>
<p>By the way, Secularsm and Christianity are also contradicting terms, so what? Wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;Civilize and Christianize&#8221; the main ideology and &#8220;White Man&rsquo;s burden&#8221; once in the US? Hence, Christianity might also be an ideology in this manner, in my opinion. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Who says that I`m unable to tell apart Turks from Arabs or Kurds?<br>
-&gt; I say it and I&rsquo;m quite right about that: By claiming honor killings are very common among Turks, you should have said among Kurds and Arabs. Ordinary Turks condemn honor killing as strongly as you and it&rsquo;s not present in the Western Turkey.</p>
<p>whose territories had been annexed by Turkey, is an easy cop-out!</p>
<p>-&gt;Had been annexed? When? All Middle East belonged once to Turkey as it had been belonged to other great powers, such as Byzantine Empire, Romans and other ancient civilizations. Everyone displaced everyone, it&rsquo;s the rule of the world as your Germanic ancestors destroyed the Roman empire, colonized Burgundy and Lombardy and England and gave her name to France. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Nothing has been annexed in the recent history, only Anatolia and a small chunk of Thrace could be saved from the carcass of Ottoman Empire. Over 5 mil Turks were expelled from Balkans, many others died en route. The same can be said for the Caucasus? Can we claim these territories? Of course not, as our non-Turks can&rsquo;t claim our land. Seems reasonable, isn&rsquo;t it? We can even claim Western Thrace where the Turks are being suppressed by Greek government even they are in majority.</p>
<p>According to your logic, if you don&rsquo;t want to have Turks in Germany, why don&rsquo;t you give a small territory within Germany (preferably Berlin, 3rd largest Turkish city in Europe hehe), so they can move in and leave you alone?</p>
<p>Anyway, why are your countrymen building their own ghettos with Deutschland-flags in our very south in which my people aren&rsquo;t allowed? Why don&rsquo;t learn your countrymen my language, demanding electricity bills in German,  despite insisting steadily on integration in Germany?</p>
<p>______<br>
@Sardonicus:</p>
<p>Crime is still higher among immigrant groups, including Turks, than native Germans, which makes a case for more restricted immigration to Germany.</p>
<p>-&gt;Yes, it&rsquo;s clearly higher, I agree on it with you. But it&rsquo;s up to Germans to restrict immigration from Turkey. Why do they let them in? They can encourage people to go back, why are they constantly insisting on integration rather than repatriation?</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m in favor of complete repatriation of Turks which would be very beneficial for both nations:</p>
<p>Turks living abroad are mostly very rich even they don&rsquo;t look so. They are so nationalistic, especially 2nd and 3rd generation, so why don&rsquo;t they make effort to serve their country?</p>
<p>And Germans who obviously want to see their country immigrant free would be very happy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Turks are Caucasian not Asians and are of the Mediterranean or Alpine sub groupings of the white race. Turks tend to be more religious outside the capitol Istanbul, but they are still less religious than the Arabs.&#8221; Sardonicus</p>
<p>Small corrections: The capitol of Turkey is Ankara, Istanbul is the largest city.</p>
<p>Turks mostly belong to Armenid subrace (purest form among Armenians, this is the reason why anthropologists named it so) of the Caucasian race with slight Nordic and other strains:</p>

		<p>To those discussing Turks in Germany:</p>
<p>What must be understood before formulating any credible opinion on the matter is that the American military forced the part of Germany they occupied, which eventually became the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), to take these Turks, for two main reasons:  (1) Manpower shortage after the war (whodathunk?), and (2) To diversify western Germany which they thought would preclude another GNSWP-style political party from gaining power.  I don&rsquo;t know what today&rsquo;s united Germany (technically, it was a matter of the FRG/West absorbing the defunct GDR/East in 1990) wants to do with the Turks, deport them, retain them, or what, but since the United States still occupies Germany (this is gradually ending), the German government is not fully free to make this decision.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s up to Germans to restrict immigration from Turkey. Why do they let them in? They can encourage people to go back, why are they constantly insisting on integration rather than repatriation?</p>
<p>- Probably because like any other Western nation, Germany is in the stranglehold of that contagious plague called Cultural Marxism. If I, as a native German, dared utter the words Turks and repatriation in one sentence, most of my left-leaning &#8220;fellow&#8221;-citizens would be all over my face in a minute, and (with the typical phony indignation) label me a Nazi- criminal, likely throwing in a few concentration camp analogies for good measure. Like the US, we are hell-bent on committing national suicide, the inundation of our country with indigent Third-Worlders continues unabated. BTW, due to a bilateral agreement with Turkey, the extradition of e.g. criminals with Turkish citizenship to Turkey is rendered nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Nothing has been annexed in the recent history..</p>
<p>-Sorry for the nitpicking, but what about Northern Cyprus?</p>
<p><br>

Wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Civilize and Christianize&rdquo; the main ideology and &ldquo;White Man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; once in the US? Hence, Christianity might also be an ideology in this manner, in my opinion. Please clarify.</p>
<p>- You are right insofar as you refer to Christianity as it existed until the post-colonial age, where it served as a pretext for conquering the lands of the pagans. Since then, Christianity underwent significant changes, the firm grasp the Church (Anglican, Catholic) used to have on Western Nations was pried loose and the ecclesiastical institutions were relegated to bodies of spiritual guidance without any influence on state-politics.<br>
Islam on the other hand, is still the unadulterated pan-arabic world supremacy ideology that it used to be, except that it is no longer spread through the sword (for lack of military clout of Muslim-majority nations) but rather through birth-Jihad and other new-age stealth methods. Frankly, I wonder why the proud Turkish still insist on serving as the stirrups for Arab aspirations by clinging to the Muslim religion.</p>
<p><br>
Anyway, why are your countrymen building their own ghettos with Deutschland-flags in our very south in which my people aren&rsquo;t allowed? Why don&rsquo;t learn your countrymen my language, demanding electricity bills in German, despite insisting steadily on integration in Germany?</p>
<p>- Hate to admit it, but you are right in this respect. That`s sheer hypocrisy. Nonetheless, you forgot to mention a tiny little insignificance. My countrymen buying real estate property in Southern Turkey are almost exclusively retirees, who want to spend their senior years in warmer coastal areas. They receive their pension pay-checks from the German state and are by no means a burden on Turkish tax-payers, quite the contrary. Their presence is a boon to the local economy. Your compatriots in Germany are predominantly a huge drag on our welfare systems, almost upon arrival they are elligible to an unrestricted access to family allowance, public health care and other generous subsidies, courtesy of the German tax-payers. And believe me, those new-arrivals are milking the German cash cow with great alacrity (their offspring mostly from the cradle to the crave).<br>
Of course, the involuntary magnanimity of my countrymen cannot be faulted on Turkey, stupidity always entails a hefty price to be paid, I merely wanted to embed this observation of yours in the right context.</p>
<p>Cute, isn&rsquo;t she? :)</p>
<p>- very cute indeed, but she doesn`t bear even the remotest resemblance to the man on the picture that is supposedly her father or another close relative. I guess no one would identify her as a Turkish child because she doesn`t look at all like most of her native peers. She is a rare exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>@ Question Diversity</p>
<p>I wasn`t aware of that. I always believed that our corporate fatcats were eager to boost the cheap labor rate in order to be able to mark down wages for the native population. By exerting the necessary amount of pressure on the government, they finally attained this goal. But maybe I was just mistaken.</p>

<p>-&gt; Sorry but this isn&rsquo;t our fault if you decided to commit suicide. I&rsquo;d rather blame the German government instead of those unwanted incomers. Why doesn&rsquo;t Germany have a nationalist party to vote for it?</p>
<p>BTW, due to a bilateral agreement with Turkey, the extradition of e.g. criminals with Turkish citizenship to Turkey is rendered nearly impossible.</p>
<p>-&gt; It isn&rsquo;t our fault, either. Blame former German governments again, especially SPD and the Green fascists who distributed German passports like loo papers. </p>
<p>what about Northern Cyprus?</p>
<p>-&gt;You are quite one-sided, like in the so-called Armenian case. Do a little more detailed research and I think you&rsquo;ll give me right why I don&rsquo;t consider it as an annexation. In my opinion, this problem is to be solved by Turks and Greeks and it&rsquo;s nobody elses business.</p>
<p>Those new-arrivals are milking the German cash cow with great alacrity (their offspring mostly from the cradle to the crave).</p>
<p>-&gt;Obviously unemployment are quite higher than Germans but why don&rsquo;t you cut their benefits? They will either have to work hard or simply go back. If they commit crime, show zero tolerance. Make them feel that they are not welcome. Problem solved.</p>
<p>But I do think you generalize too much, I know many hardworking Turks (some of them are my colleagues at the plant where I currently work (Daimler), others run restaurants), they also don&rsquo;t like welfare dependents and consider them as traitors against German state.</p>
<p>no one would identify her as a Turkish child because she doesn`t look at all like most of her native peers. </p>
<p>-&gt; I don&rsquo;t care who would German identify as Turkish, they are quite bad at classifying (I was classified as Italian, Albanian, Portuguese, Russian, Arab and even English?? by them). The reason might be the inclusive meaning of Turk (a citizen of the Republic of Turkey), lumping Kurds (at least 10 mil fully or partly, a good number of them assimilated), Armenians (100.000 officially, converts and illegal immigrants unknown), Arabs (at least 1 mil, mostly ethnically conscious) and Caucasian people (more than 1,5 mil but mostly fully assimilated) into the same category. As I already said, at least 50% of so called Turks in Germany aren&rsquo;t ethnically Turkish. That&rsquo;s the reason why Turks have a bad image in Europe. Many of them are surprisingly &#8220;Turkish&#8221; when they commit crime or do something bad, but they are not Turks and &#8220;suppressed minorities&#8221; otherwise.</p>
<p>In fact, such individuals like the little girl are not in majority like in Central and Northern Europe, albeit not that rare. For example, K. Atatürk (means Father of all Turks) who also was blue-eyed and blond and 100% Turkish (his family tree was published a couple of months ago).</p>

That is a VERY, VERY good question.  But customs, once entrenched, die hard.  </p>
<p>Islam is a vehicle for Arabian cultural imperialism.  When will these other nationalities wake up to realize that they have been used to spread what is, for them, a foreign religion that teaches the customs and values, even the language, of another people?  For Arabs it is natural, it is their own culture and their own language;  but it is not natural for Turks, Persians, Indonesians, Pakistanis, etc.</p>
