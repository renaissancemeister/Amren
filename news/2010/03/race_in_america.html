<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The University of Pittsburgh has set the stage for a solution-focused dialogue on race, one that will bring together some of the best minds on this important subject [June 3-6, 2010]. Pitt&rsquo;s School of Social Work and the school&rsquo;s Center on Race and Social Problems will host Race in America: Restructuring Inequality, a national conference in Pittsburgh, Pa.

<p>Is the FTC paying attention?  This violates truth in advertising laws.  The reason I know this is that Jared Taylor won&rsquo;t be there.  J. Phillipe Rushton, neither.</p>

<p>First off, the good news.  Non whites&hellip;especially blacks&hellip;.aren&rsquo;t going to have to worry about inequality for much longer, because the country will be in a full-blown depression, without any money to pursue nonsense activities like inequality conferences, so inequality will be a much lesser worry for them.</p>
<p>But the bad news is that their whining about inequality will be replaced with the stark realization that they&rsquo;re going to be in a bare-knuckles fight for survival.</p>

		<p>Yes, with billions of dollars of unused stimulus money, and Democrats in control of Congress, this is definitely the time to do a massive transfer of wealth to blacks in order to &#8220;correct&#8221; inequalities.</p>
<p>The &#8220;solutions&#8221; will be large government programs that will be staffed with blacks to provide services/&#8221;opportunities&#8221; to blacks.</p>
<p>The inequalities will be &#8220;corrected&#8221; by increasing the amount that Whites have to pay to provide welfare/government jobs to blacks.  More government debt that Whites will have to pay off in the future.</p>

		<p>All my life they have been &#8220;correcting racial inequality&#8221;, fighting racism, and &#8220;creating change&#8221;.  This has been going on for as long as I can remember. And they&rsquo;re still working on it!  How long will this project take?  Aside from creating well-paid jobs for Diversity Experts, sociology professors, and black politicians, has anything beneficial been achieved yet?</p>

		<p>Restructuring equality? ? ?</p>
<p>Does that term imply we Whites are now required to commit as many crimes, proportionally, as Afro-Americans or Latinos?</p>
<p>Does it give Whites the chance to play the &#8220;race card&#8221; if we&rsquo;re caught saying or doing the wrong thing?</p>
<p>Does it mean we Whites can lay around and collect welfare as easily, as unquestioned as Blacks?</p>

Why are our &#8220;best minds&#8221; devoting their mental energies to devising new ways to give shiftless louts more free money? </p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they be working on building lunar colonies, genetic engineering, curing cancer, etc.?</p>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s only an issue if it&rsquo;s an area where they lag behind, never an issue where they are a majority. They only want the good things. Just like the women&rsquo;s movement. Your job and your girlfriend. Or in the case of the white women&rsquo;s movement: your job (provided it&rsquo;s a good one) and the other man. <br>
