			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Janet Daley, London Telegraph, February 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So now we know what Labour&rsquo;s immigration policy was really about. The &#8220;open door&#8221; was not simply held ajar in order to admit a fresh workforce that would help to fill gaps in the growing economy. Nor was it just a gesture of hospitality and goodwill to those who were fleeing from repressive or inhospitable regimes in order to seek a better life. Both of those aims would have been credible  &mdash;  if controversial and not thought-through in all their consequences. And so would the longer-term view that dynamic, cosmopolitan societies are generally healthier and more productive than in-bred, isolated ones, or that immigrants who tend to be ambitious for themselves and their families could help to counter the passivity and defeatism that tend to be endemic in the British class system.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, the policy was motivated by something far more radical and fundamental than any of this. The full text of the draft policy paper composed in 2000 by a Home Office research unit  &mdash;  the gist of which had already been made public by a former Labour adviser  &mdash;  was released last week under Freedom of Information rules. Properly understood, it is political dynamite. What it states quite unequivocally was that mass immigration was being encouraged at least as much for &#8220;social objectives&#8221; as for economic ones. Migration was intended specifically to alter the demographic and cultural pattern of the country: to produce by force majeure the changes in attitude that the Labour government saw itself as representing.</p>
<p>Tony Blair&rsquo;s &#8220;forces of conservatism&#8221; speech; his improbable presentation of Britain as a &#8220;young country&#8221;; the advocacy of a multicultural society which would have to reassess its own history, replacing traditional pride with inherited guilt: all of this could be facilitated by a large influx of migrants whose presence in the population would require the wholesale deconstruction of the country&rsquo;s sense of its own identity.</p>
<p>This may all sound rather far-fetched now, but try to recall just how much hubris the New Labour tide brought with it in the beginning: the contempt for history and the Year Zero arrogance with which they set about &#8220;modernising&#8221; the nation&rsquo;s institutions. It was, in this respect, a prime example of the new direction which Left-wing parties were forced to take in the wake of Marxism&rsquo;s collapse. Having lost the great economic argument of the 20th century, the Left had to switch its focus to society itself: if humanity could not be transformed through the redistribution of wealth and the socialist command economy, then it would have to be transfigured by altering social relations.</p>
<p>The object of the exercise was still to produce, in the words of an old Left-wing protest song, a &#8220;new world&#8221; based on a &#8220;new man&#8221;. But now the new man (sorry, &#8220;person&#8221;) would be formed not by changes in the power of capital or the ownership of the means of production, but in cultural attitudes and behaviour. The revolution now had to be confined to what went on in people&rsquo;s heads: to their values, their assumptions and their reactions to each other.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;altering consciousness&#8221;, which had once meant awakening the proletariat to its own economic enslavement, now referred to raising awareness of social injustices, such as intolerance of cultural differences, social inequality, or discrimination against minorities. But the subtext was always self-examination and personal guilt: the indigenous Briton must be trained (literally, by the education system) always to question the acceptability of his own attitudes, to cast doubt on his own motives, to condemn his own national identity and history, to accept the blame even for the misbehaviour of new migrants  &mdash;  whose conduct could only be a reflection of the unfortunate way they were treated by the host population.</p>
<p>Included in this programme for the newly constituted British psyche was a whole package of subliminal assumptions, which were adapted from the Old Left stable: international solidarity rather than national sovereignty, collective values rather than personal conscience, and &#8220;social equality&#8221; rather than individual achievement. It was a peculiarity of New Labour&rsquo;s vanity that it actually tried to persuade the country that, under the miraculous Blair dispensation, it could have both sides of these dualities at the same time. But the full consequences of the new country that it envisaged, and the role that immigration was to play in the creation of it, broke the most basic rule of the democratic process: the electorate was never told it was voting for that.</p>
<p>The goal was a social revolution abetted by the influx of a huge variety of diverse cultures, which would provide both the need and the pretext for reshaping British life. It may have been relatively new (at least in Britain) as a specific political policy, but it was much of a piece with the conventional objective of Left-wing political movements, which is to transform human nature.</p>
<p>When you decide whether to give your support to a party of the Left or of the Right, you are actually making a judgment about what you think politics is for. If you believe that it is the function of government to alter or determine people&rsquo;s perceptions and responses  &mdash;  their innermost feelings about themselves and others  &mdash;  then you will probably opt for the Left. If you take the view that the state should concern itself only with behaviour  &mdash;  with what people do, especially insofar as it affects other people, rather than what they think or feel  &mdash;  then you will be more likely to veer to the Right. So this is really a question of whether you want politics to be concerned with what goes on in people&rsquo;s heads as much as with events in the objective world.</p>
<p>But of course, at least since the 1960s, when &#8220;raising consciousness&#8221; became the refrain of every group that sought change in any sphere, almost all parties have had to talk this way to some extent. It has become part of the politician&rsquo;s acknowledged brief to suggest ways in which the internal lives and attitudes of voters can be influenced or directed. There is scarcely a party leader now who would dare to say that these matters are none of his (or any government&rsquo;s) business.</p>
<p>Almost no one seems prepared to discuss the obvious danger: that if politics becomes a replacement for religion by taking upon itself the responsibility for transfiguring human nature then politicians, of all people, become the prophets and the priests. Just at the moment, I can&rsquo;t think of a more absurd idea.<br>

<p>The above ludicrous idea is often pushed by the Multicults   &mdash;   i.e., that England or America cannot possibly prosper without massive racial diversity.  However, this is a blatant, outrageous lie.  </p>
<p>First of all, both the UK and America were at their greatest powers when they were the most homogeneous.  Once, Britannia ruled the world   &mdash;   and they did it when their population was 99.8% White.  Same for America, which saw its height during 1950-1970.  </p>
<p>When both the UK and USA were homogeneous, they excelled at global trade and were economic powerhouses.  Today, after massive immigration, our economy and world economic power are declining (vs. China &amp; India).  Thus, Diversity correlates with economic decline, not success, and social unrest and pathology, not stability and health.  </p>
<p>Likewise, virtually all wars were fought over some sort of &#8220;diversity&#8221; (racial, ethnic, religious, political, wealth, language, etc.).  Diversity causes suspicion &amp; stress, which leads to conflict.</p>

<p>OK, I might be dense here. I&rsquo;m just not fully understanding the reason for implementing this type of social change. I can see what they (the Lefties) are doing, and I can see the result of this &#8220;social engineering&#8221;, but what I just can&rsquo;t wrap my head around is &#8220;WHY?&#8221;. What is the (hoped for) end result of this new society they are trying to create? Who and what are benefiting from these changes? Having millions of non-English speaking, surly foreigners on welfare cannot possibly do them any good from any angle, even as cheap labor. The motive doesn&rsquo;t seem to be purely economic, which I could understand. It just seems to me that it is motivated by some sort of inexplicable hatred of native ethnic Britons. If anyone knows of any good essays that can point me in the right direction please post a link for all to see. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one that is puzzled by the rationale of these insane social policies!   </p>

<p>I hope the British will turn heavily towards the British National Party after hearing this revelation.</p>
<p>War is being waged against the native Briton.  He must now stand against his destruction with all his might or be swept into the dustbin of history.</p>
<p>Here in the USA things are no better.  Whether for cheap labor or social change, White culture is being pushed down and to the side with genocide being the long term result.</p>

		<p>Despite David Cameron&rsquo;s commitment to diversity, it seems that many Conservative newspapers are adapting BNP talking points. While it&rsquo;s good that immigration is being criticized by mainstream outlets, I&rsquo;m worried that the Tories will try to steal the BNP&rsquo;s thunder. It seems that Margaret Thatcher did the same thing to the National Front. </p>
<p>On a good note though, I like how the concept of indigenous British is becoming more and more accepted. Whereas only a short while ago only the BNP were declaring white British indigenous, now it seems like opposition to that concept is breaking down. </p>

		<p>You know, 68 or so years ago, the Brits were left standing alone facing both Hitler and Russia - a tiny little island nation against the conquerors of the rest of Europe.  They did not give up or capitulate.  And yes, we came to the rescue   &mdash;   but the point is, those Brits who fought so hard and died fighting for their country&rsquo;s independence and freedom   &mdash;   I wonder if any of the survivors are now asking themselves why they did it if it&rsquo;s all come to this.  Hardly seems worth all that sacrifice it the stupid leftists are going to GIVE away the UK&rsquo;s freedoms as if they were handing out something as insignificant as toilet paper rolls to the general populace&hellip;</p>

		<p>Though the Left accuses anyone with a racial conscience of racism, the bitter irony is that the Left practices negative eugenics to &#8220;transform&#8221; society. What&rsquo;s the moral divide between Leftist eugenics and Nazi eugenics? At least the Nazis were honest about their goals of creating a Master Race. The Labour Party hid the truth about mass immigration behind a veil of platitudes about mulitculturalism and diversity. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the radical liberal tactic.  Obama and his Center for American Progress know how change happens- through force and coercion whites into surrendering their white privilege and agreeing that dispossessing themselves of their country and blood is the ethical thing to do; justice and empathy require that whites put non whites ahead of ourselves.  </p>
<p>We will become like Britain, and our white daughters will become afro lovers, and our grandchildren will  be mongrels.</p>

<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s because they want to be reelected. Political parties like the Democrats and Labour are famous for doling out the national treasure to the nation&rsquo;s least productive. They want to import masses of third-worlders who will be beholden to their party. The immigrants aren&rsquo;t stupid, they learn which party ladles out the most gravy.</p>
<p>The problem arises when there aren&rsquo;t enough working whites left to keep the gravy train going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a pyramid scheme. It&rsquo;s great short-term profits for those at the top, but it comes at the expense of the suckers who bought into it.</p>

		<p>2 GoAway: Hatred it is.  The Left is essentially institutionalized hatred.  It was not love of humanity that filled the Gulag.  It was not love of the working class that led American intellectuals to ignore Red brutality, when they weren&rsquo;t defending it.  It is not love of Blacks that leads liberals to welcome millions of Mexicans and other non-Whites, who view Blacks much as we do.  The hatred they are always accusing us of is located in their own hearts.  </p>

<p>       On what basis do left wing idiots come up with rubbish like that? The European powers were extremely homogeneous when they built world empires and the only non-Whites who came close to equalling the west in power, dynamism, technology etc&hellip; were the homogeneous Japanese. Today Brazil, India, Venezuela etc&hellip; are hellholes while nations like S.Korea and Finland are successfully nations. Can these leftists not open their eyes and see? When I look around the world what do I see? I see wherever Whites (especially those of Northern European background) and North East Asians settle, the standard of living goes up while wherever black people settle, the place soon turns into a hell-hole with the other races falling in between. <br>

		<p>GoAway asks,&#8221;Why?&#8221; Follow the money, GoAway, follow the money. Global Capital figured it out a long time ago: Let the Left use Cultural Marxism {the concepts of Political Correctness, Multi-Culturalism, Feminisn etc.} to break down society, national boundaries, national identity, the family unit and allow, or manufacture, societal breakdown. Then we will all be serfs. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have money, power and influence now you never will have those things. Nor will your children or grand children. </p>
<p>Just imagine a world with a President of The Americas; a President of Europe; a President of Asia. Imagine a world where the president of a formerly sovereign nation state has no more power than your town mayor. Imagine a world where every worthwhile business is owned by one of a few multi-national conglomerates. </p>
<p>If free-thinking, independent people in the White world don&rsquo;t wake up and start voting for people like Ron Paul and Nick Griffin the future is bleak, indeed. And we won&rsquo;t be allowed a vote to change anything. A world managed by a few politicians for the benefit of a few big businessmen. The rest of us will have to do as Mexicans and Africans do now: risk life and limb to go ANY where to get ANY job that pays ANY wage. </p>
<p>George Orwell touched on some of it in 1984 and the rest is just the next logical step. GoAway, I suggest you research the Frankfurt School, Marx, Hitler, Lenin and any other totalitarian you can think of.</p>
<p>Serfdom here we come.</p>

		<p>   The same thing is being done to America . In an attempt to understand the forces at work, you should watch the debate between Mr Taylor and Peter March . When you listen to Mr March, it really begins to sink in just how warped the thought processes of the liberal are . It&rsquo;s disconcerting to say the least as you begin to realize the trouble the west is in and the obvious power men like March hold and are able to greatly influence the directions our civilizations will be taking . On the WW2 British survivors, there was an article, I believe I saw it here on Amren . The WW2 British generation is not happy with the way things are going and many of them question whether they would have or even should have fought so hard had they known some 60 years later where it would all be headed . </p>

		<p>The point is to turn people into cultureless workers &amp; above all into consumers who fill the void opened by the new cultural &amp; ethnic masochism with CONSUMERIST HEDONISM. A major part of it was getting women into the workforce, doubling the number of consumers &amp; the alienation as feminism engendered loneliness for all. After the bravest &amp; most noble MEN died in WW1&2, the fools lacked guideance &amp; were easy pray to their own stupidity exploited against them.</p>

		<p>#2, I believe the whole cultural left agenda is rooted partly in the desire to destroy Christianity and Western values, thus paving the way for societies in which all types of sexuality are not just tolerated, but accepted.  The movement is also peopled by those who feel guilty about the historically superior status of whites and white males in particular.  <br>
As one who came of age in the sixties, I once bought into the liberal argument that all races are intellectually equal, that any disparity is because of historical isolation, white racism, slave status, etc.  After decades of seeing little overall advancement in the black population, even with perks galore, I started to question my beliefs.  I obtained the verboten books about race disparity and became enlightened.  I was stunned to find that the millenium-old contentions are absolutely true!  No wonder the leftists are terrified of race-realist speakers who impress anyone as well-informed intellectuals!<br>
The old colonialists of Europe probably tried to warn their countrymen about the importation of third-worlders, but the younger generation knew no better and were subject to the left agenda.  Now, they have found out. </p>

		<p>Destroying patriotism, is just one necessary step for one worlders to take over. This is all laid out in the communist manifesto, written by their glorious mentor Karl Marx. Their plan is to indoctrinate young impressionable children, take over all media, gain control of the schools, and the government. This has for all intents, and purposes, been accomplishedin the U.

		<p>No particular comment on the article except to make my usual point: if you are ethnically British, or a person of European ancestry who is now a British citizen, then a vote for anyone but the BNP or a Conservative (depending on who&rsquo;s most likely to win) is a vote for GENOCIDE - your own genocide.</p>
<p>The socialists and communists of Labour - and yes, there are at least six Labour ministers with Marxist pasts - are foursquare in favor of your destruction. They hate Britain, its people, its culture, its history. They could not give a spit for your welfare or your survival. They do not even consider themselves British, but post-nationalist &#8220;citizens of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has never been more obvious than now. There motives couldn&rsquo;t be any more clear. Vote BNP or vote for your death.</p>

<p>Orwell indeed addressed the issue in 1984 and in fact Winston Smith posed the exact same question: &#8220;I understand how.  I don&rsquo;t understand why?&#8221;  To which his tormentor O&rsquo;Brien explained that it was pure power with which the Party pursued for its own sake, using as a metaphor a boot stamping on a human face, forever.  </p>

		<p>Michael Moore stated that he couldn&rsquo;t wait for whites to become a minority so that America would vote in socialism.  He merely stated what every leftist multi-culti has in his heart.  Democrats want to give illegals amnesty <i>precisely</i> because they know that this will lock in a left wing Democratic majority.  (RINOs like John McCain favor the same thing because they are stupid and can see no further than their desire to get their lawns mowed cheaply.)</p>

<p>Disagree totally with this. Feminism was seperate from this and had to do with inequities women faced at the time, it had nothing to do with consumerism nor causing loneliness.</p>

<p>Whites are the new minorities in the world, and we soon may be in our own countries, but the code word &#8220;minority&#8221; has come to mean, and surely will be continued to be used by the MSM to mean &#8220;non-white&#8221; and/or &#8220;hispanic&#8221;.</p>

		<p>   Respectfully # 24, I have to disagree at least in part . Feminism has had a share in helping dismantle the West . We all want parity, justice etc. But when the rights of  women or any other group, begin to supersede responsibilities, duty and the family, then you wind up with what we have now . It&rsquo;s not working . Everything is out of kilter and a civilization is dying out because of it .The reasons are myriad . This is an over simplification I admit, but feminism has knocked a major dent in what used to be a scrupulously cared for machine .   </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I agree ENTIRELY with it!  Whether or not feminism was separate from or a part of The Agenda, is irrelevant anyway. I&rsquo;m not privy to their agenda, but the end result   &mdash;   and we can see it all around us   &mdash;   is that it doubled the number of consumers and producers in the workforce, undeniably, making the money masters very happy,  but at the cost of a great deal of social alienation, disastrous birthrates requiring immigration to fill the gap, and a generation of unhappy, sexually confused, and poorly socialized children who do not bode well for our national future.</p>
<p>You can also read the social alienation in the posts from the many unhappy men (and women too) who complain here constantly about the opposite sex. Something is obviously wrong!  There has also been (as Harvard&rsquo;s Professor Putnam has written) a decrease in trust and a commensurate increase in loneliness, isolation, and social fragmentation, with all the accompanying problems. In hindsight, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been a very good bargain.</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;Putnam talks about how the mass migration of women from &ldquo;kitchens to offices&rdquo; has put enormous pressures on community life in America, even as it has infused extremely valuable talent into our economy; he notes that we have failed to view the public dimensions of this and still treat the ability of families to connect into community as purely a private issue to be negotiated within that family.</i> <br>

		<p>I think the American corporate establishment latched onto feminism and pushed it along, NOT because they agree with all the precepts of feminism, but because they wanted more people in the labor force to drive down wages.  The unfortunate circumstance of the time when this happened was that inflation was a bad problem, so wage declines were covered up by inflation.</p>
