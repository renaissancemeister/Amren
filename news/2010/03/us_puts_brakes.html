<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE62F61T20100316">U.S. Puts Brakes on &#8220;Virtual&#8221; Border Fence</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Gaynor, Reuters, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. government is pulling $50 million in funding from a problematic &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; meant to secure stretches of the Mexico border and is freezing additional funding for the project pending review, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said an allocation of $50 million in funds made under the Recovery Act would be taken away from the ill-starred SBInet program, which seeks to mesh video cameras, radar, sensors and other technologies into a high-tech system to detect smugglers.</p>
<p>Napolitano said the project, which started in 2006 and was being developed by Boeing Co, has been beset by technical problems, missed deadlines and cost overruns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security will redeploy $50 million of Recovery Act funding originally allocated for the SBInet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to other tested, commercially available security technology along the Southwest border,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Napolitano said funds allocated to the program would be diverted to acquire existing technologies including mobile surveillance equipment, thermal imaging devices, ultra-light plane detection systems, mobile radios, cameras and laptop computers for vehicles used by Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>She said the department also had frozen all funding beyond SBInet&rsquo;s initial deployment to two areas south of Tucson and Ajo, Arizona, pending completion of an assessment ordered in January.</p>

		<p>Virtual fences are easier to stop building real ones. That&rsquo;s why they started the virtual one. </p>
<p>Fences are offensive. They separate people and violate the civil and human rights of non whites who we need to help punish the White Community for past racism and lingering hostility toward the global family and for refusal to passionately the benefits of Diversity.</p>
<p>Obama needs the non white border crashers to come here in even greater numbers so when he gives them citizenship, the vote, and free health care for live, he can rightfully claim all the forthcoming humanitarian awards and $1,000,000 speaking engagements for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Bill and Hillary made $100,000,000 over the ten years after he left office. Obama and the No Fence policy will make him even richer than that.</p>

		<p>The law states that the Fed must build a real fence.</p>
<p>The real law was ignored, and they set upon to build a &#8220;virtual fence&#8221;. </p>
<p>Of course, that failed. </p>
<p>Now apparently they&rsquo;re going to give the whole thing up, which was their plan all along.</p>

		<p>Why am I not surprised? The forces favoring open borders represent too much of the power elite in America: corporations, media, universities, and too many politicians.</p>
<p>On a more practical level: could a fence be built which would actually secure the borders? To make it work, it would have to be backed up by considerable &#8220;boots on the ground,&#8221; which would mean a massive expansion of the Border Patrol. Otherwise, border crossers would simply cut their way through it. The people demanding such a fence may not have thought the thing through. I&rsquo;d venture to say that it would require a considerable mobilization to actually secure the borders, and your average American is too busy watching television to get involved.</p>

		<p>Americans have lost all faith in the Federal government protecting us against the tide of illegal invasion so that Janet Napolitano&rsquo;s discussion of diverting the funds to something more useful is meaningless.</p>

		<p>The virtual fence did the job it was really intended to do.  Namely, it was designed to take political pressure off of building a real fence.  Now that Obama is President and the Democrats control both Houses of Congress, they ag-lobby can rest easier for now.  I am sure this will be reserected when things heat up again.  </p>

		<p>The virtual fence was never intended to work anyway.  As a previous poster said, it was only &#8220;started&#8221; because it temporarily appeased some persons.  It made our government look like they were doing something when, of course, they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If our government really wanted to stop illegal immigration, they could do it in 48 hours. Putting barbed wire on the border backed up by troops would stop about 99% of the illegal immigration overnight.  What is so hard about that solution?</p>
<p>Why is our government giving this country away?</p>

		<p>The posters who state that the virtual fence was never intended to work anyway, have it correct.  A real fence, where it was tried, proved to work too well at stopping illegals.  </p>
<p>This in turn made Mexico very mad, which was intolerable to our political betters. How dare we try to stop superior brown people from taking advantage of what is rightfully theirs anyway?</p>
<p>The solution by DHS was to come up with a fix where they could say we had a fence but in reality we didn&rsquo;t, hence the farce of a virtual fence. This pleased everybody, especially the Mexican government and racist Hispanics on our side.  </p>
<p>Sure a real fence can be breached by cutting holes through it and scaling over, but such efforts take time and somebody working a cutting torch could easily be spotted. The same is true with ladders, anyone scaling the fence this way can be  seen easily as well.  </p>
<p>The Border Patrol has a strength of about 19000.  If all these were devoted to boots on the border, there would be enough guards to link up hand to hand across known smuggling routes.  Couple this with a real fence and the problem is mostly solved. </p>
<p>Border Patrol agents are really guards. If the agency would abolish all the special units such as their tactical teams, aid and comfort squads,and overseas assigned personnel, they would have sufficient numbers to do an adequate job.  </p>
<p>Additionally, there are enough personnel assigned to BP-HQ, DC, doing make work to back-fill a new patrol sector with personnel. They could also reduce basic training to six weeks instead of the current 12 to 18 weeks.  How much training does a guard need?</p>
<p>But, the elites have decided that they want an overwhelmingly third world population to replace troublesome whites, and they will do it.  The virtual fence was merely a bait and switch, a fake. </p>
<p>It did nothing but make a lot of people rich, including Sylvester Reyes, Congressman, Demonrat, El Paso.      <br>

President Obama will pass amnesty by this November.</p>
<p>Someone needs to explain to him that when Americans said they wanted him to make jobs his number one priority, they meant for U.S. citizens.</p>
