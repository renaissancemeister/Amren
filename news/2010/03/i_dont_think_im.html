<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>With few exceptions, the process of becoming competent in multicultural discourse is advanced by an initial event or &#8220;encounter&#8221; that challenges individuals to reconsider their beliefs and attitudes. The encounter, according to Gay, is &#8220;an experience or event that shatters a person&rsquo;s current feelings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It may be real or vicarious, personal or social, verbal or visual.&#8221; The design and provision of such encounters is a decisive component of our diversity work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Teaching Diverse Students Initiative (TDSi), now available at www.tolerance.org/tdsi, includes a number of resources to help create an encounter experience. The section on &#8220;Understanding the Influence of Race&#8221; includes tools to help teachers examine their own biases and think critically about what &#8220;race&#8221; really means.</p>
<p>Another encounter experience that we use can be found at the website for the Public Broadcasting Service television series &#8220;Race: the Power of an Illusion.&#8221; The &#8220;Sorting People&#8221; exercise asks participants to categorize individuals into racial/ethnic groups based solely on their visual appearance. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} One of the most powerful readings for our predominantly white, female students is Peggy McIntosh&rsquo;s 1999 article, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack. Most of these students are unaware of the privileges they receive just by being born white in the United States and are startled to read this article. We often accompany it with another article, White Privilege in Schools, by Ruth Anne Olson (1999). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Dismissal</b></p>
<p>&#8220;None of this is true; the author obviously has a political agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the least effective strategies we have found in addressing this response is trying to convince the individual of the accuracy of the source. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Disbelief</b></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think that I can really be biased. I grew up in a diverse neighborhood, and I have a lot of friends who are African American.&#8221; or &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t grow up privileged. My family didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, and we worked for everything we got.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Teachers view themselves as &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;fair&#8221; people, and they are skeptical about being biased. They are typically eager to cling to the comfort of their perceived neutrality on such issues, which again can provide a roadblock to productive dialogue and reflection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Acceptance</b></p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense to me that I am biased, because I am white and I grew up only around white people.&#8221; or &#8220;I do think I have received privileges because of being white, but that is how things are. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} This line of reasoning rationalizes their bias and sense of privilege. They see bias and privilege as societal issues, rather than personal ones, and this allows them to avoid taking responsibility for their attitudes and biases.</p>
<p>The teachers with whom we work accept the societal factors that have contributed to bias but don&rsquo;t see their inaction as contributing to the problem. At this point, we use readings from Tatum&rsquo;s (2003) book, which provides the example of the moving sidewalk at the airport as analogous to racism in America. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Discomfort</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Much of this is surprising to me as well as embarrassing. I am mortified by the fact that I have taken issues of privilege for granted that people of color struggle with on a daily basis.&#8221; or &#8220;I have always been proud of being color blind and treating people fairly .&nbsp;.&nbsp; now I&rsquo;m wondering if I was being unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} One of the resources that we refer to is the movie, Crash, which shows the devastating effects of overt and hidden bias.</p>
<p>Discomfort can manifest itself in other ways as well. Some teachers with whom we work frequently hold great pride in their pronouncement of being actively &#8220;color bind&#8221; when it comes to their students. They view this as an expression of their lack of bias, and it can be difficult to readjust this thinking. {snip}</p>
<p>When teachers express discomfort, we encourage them to explore ways to take action to combat stereotyping and discrimination. We suggest examining materials in classrooms for racism and sexism, addressing and eliminating racist language, and examining school policies and practices that discriminate against particular groups of students. {snip}</p>
<p><b>Disclosure</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything I am experiencing shows me that I have strong preference for African American individuals. I interpret this as a distrust of white people, which is unfortunately true.&#8221;</p>
<p>A less common response is when individuals actually disclose a conscious bias. This differs from the acceptance response, where an acknowledgment of a hidden bias is recognized. This response is characterized by an open admission of prejudice  &mdash;  a step beyond acceptance. This confession requires a great deal of honesty and courage and can be disquieting to divulge.</p>
<p>Although there is the potential for this response to elicit alarm, our experiences indicate a level of self-awareness that differentiates these respondents from others. Individuals who disclose personal bias frequently express how hard they work to intentionally focus on others&rsquo; abilities, without regard to race. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>As teacher educators, we continue to challenge ourselves to provide varied opportunities for teachers as they engage in the exploration of education for social justice. This work is not achieved without challenge. As we present pre-service and practicing teachers with new ideology and experience, we also must acknowledge ourselves as cultural beings continuously encountering and interpreting ideas and interactions. This process of continuous mindfulness and self-examination seats us as co-learners, with each discourse providing opportunity for illumination.</p>

		<p>Oh, I feel so &#8220;privileged&#8221; to read this article!  Before I read it I didn&rsquo;t know just how &#8220;privileged&#8221; I was.  Every day I see Blacks, Hispanics, Gays, Lesbians, Muslims, etc. taking our jobs through affirmative action quotas.  I see our neighborhoods being ruined and practically every neighborhood I lived in as a child and young adult has been taken over and virtually destroyed by Blacks and Hispanics.  I see every organization imaginable for all of these groups.  I see Whites themselves - especially young Whites - buying into this multicultural and diversity madness with all of the media propaganda and being much more concerned for the rights of every other group but their own.  I see La Raza with slogans like, &#8220;For the Race everything, For those outside of the race - NOTHING.&#8221;  Oh what a terrible racist I&rsquo;ve been to hold my outdated attitudes.  Oh how heinous we Whites are to think we have even the smallest of rights to assemble for our own interests.  I think it&rsquo;s time we all donated our bank accounts, 401k pension plans and everything else we own to those poor non-Whites that we so blatantly discriminated against.  Oh I just can&rsquo;t wait for King Obama to decree reparations to everyone we evil Whites have wronged throughout history.</p>
<p>Oh please forgive us everyone!  Oh please!</p>

<p>This statement is actually true. </p>
<p>When I was a child and still had childish beliefs, I believed that blacks were just white people wrapped in dark skin.  It wasn&rsquo;t until fourth grade when my public school was integrated that I began to have &#8220;encounters&#8221; with &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  I began to notice how some kids were louder, more unruly, and less focused on learning than others.  I also began to notice how blacks and latinos had a higher propensity for initiating violence.  </p>
<p>Nine years later, I decided that I had had enough &#8220;diversity&#8221; to last me a lifetime.  </p>

		<p>Are the thirty five thousand White women raped by black men every year privileged?  Is sickle cell anemia an illusion?  Is race the only area in the marxist religion where evolution fails, and a miracle made every human on the planet the same?  Is the degenerate behavior of blacks in every corner of the world a myth?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s odd. I am keenly aware, and even quite proud of the fact that I am sensibly biased - any healthy, thinking person is! However, I have not a shread, not a scintilla of guilt for my alleged white &#8220;privilege.&#8221; I do feel privileged to be a member of the noble white racial family, but will apologize for that when Hell freezes over. </p>

<p>That is true but not in the way the author intended.  After years of liberal indoctrination a person usually matures and at some point in their life everything they have been taught is shattered by reality.  Suddenly they learn to rely on what they observe rather than what they have been taught.  The person then breaks from liberal ideology and becomes a realist.  </p>

		<p>Of course you&rsquo;re biased.  Since you are, you&rsquo;re going to have to keep on buying &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; material from the Southern Poverty Law Center, over and over and over again.  And you&rsquo;ll have to keep buying it until you&rsquo;re not biased anymore, which will be never, because Morris Dees has bills to pay.</p>

		<p>The great lie here is that whites are placed into a position where they are assumed to have unfairly privileged lives because they were born in a white majority nation.  What a load!  ANYONE who is born in ANY country and is part of that nations majority will NATURALLY feel more comfortable and will RIGHTLY  be more readily accomodated.  To seek to undo this order of things is UNNATURAL and nothing less than a power play by whoever is sponsoring the movement to ROB the individual of what their parents and ancestors worked for and EARNED with their sweat and blood (and tears).</p>

		<p>They admit education is &#8220;for social justice&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Education was once about developing virtuous leaders who could apply learned wisdom in leading and preserving the republic. We are so far past that notion that we are circling the drain.</p>
<p>The entire scam and shakedown of teaching tolerance is that all are presumed guilty and must admit their guilt and then accept the precepts of social justice, the fundamental principle of which is the dispossession of whites from their own nation and culture.</p>
<p>Teachers who dissent will be fired. This is a totalitarian thugocracy.  It won&rsquo;t last except at the point of a gun. Coercion is all they have left, and they will use it.  It&rsquo;s the American way, i.e. Lincoln, Stevens &amp; Eisenhower.</p>
<p>And they WIll shut down websites like Amren, either through technological blocking, resource confiscation, or arrest and jail. </p>

		<p>Oh boy. I usually never post on AmRen articles, but this one made me laugh out loud considering my day today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a junior professor at a small college in New York and just had to flunk a kid for plagiarism - the cardinal sin in higher ed. Anyhow, so all the race-realist stuff just comes to a boil and the truth floats to the top. The kid was a cheatin&rsquo; Southern Italian (but he&rsquo;ll get his stuff straight after this). </p>
<p>The AA students do not do anything. Seriously. I have an AA student who has not handed in anything since the beginning of the semester. And the other AA gals alternately sleep in class, and when they wake up, they just kind of moan and complain about &#8216;infomashun&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Most of the other Italians are absolutely brilliant in their work. </p>
<p>The Puerto Ricans, as can be expected, are half-and-half. &#8220;C&#8221; students who are on occasion brilliant and on others just lazy.</p>
<p>Then there are the Ruskies who are pretty damn good. Then the Jews, who are absolutely brilliant. My star student this semester is a Pole. </p>
<p>I always see what one would consider &#8220;prejudices&#8221; lived out in my college courses. Without fail. Always amazing, yet always reinforcing the obvious. </p>

Come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t notice myself enjoying any privileges other than working, obeying the law, paying my taxes and suffering the full brunt of the legal system and government nanny state should I fail to come through on all of these fronts.

I would say the very exact same thing about race realism and those that spread the word about it.  Here is the real issue.  Which position does actual experience support?  As someone nearly diametrically opposed to the attitudes, philosophies and beliefs of the guy who wrote this, I must say I whole heartily encourage this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.  I will set up a hidden camera at some random place in detroit.  I&rsquo;ll have a whole college class that is nothing more than coming in and observing whatever happens to be going on at whatever time the class meets and opening it up for class discussion.  Of course, the difference between the class I run and the class the guy who wrote this runs is they watch movies with actors showing what they want the students to believe.  Me, I&rsquo;d show them the real thing and simply ask that they use their own best judgement about what it means.</p>

<p>The idea behind &#8216;turing around&rsquo; schools or &#8216;transformation&rsquo; is underlined with the act of firing all the &#8216;existing staff&rsquo; and starting &#8216;fresh.&rsquo;  Like a kid who tires of building a teetering tower with his blocks and angrily sweeps them away.  So all the over 30 years old teachers get canned and they staff the place with 22-24 year old &#8220;Teach for America&#8221; and other such &#8216;teachers&rsquo; who have almost no content knowledge AT ALL, but who are adept at implementing a &#8216;social justice&rsquo; curriculum which focuses on &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; in all subjects and uses &#8216;project-based learning&rsquo; (PBL) as the main method of instruction.</p>
<p>PBL is basically putting smart kids and dunces together and producing a poster board or some such nonsense.  Every gets credit and everyone passes their classes.  The kids thus get no content knowledge but become well versed in the ways of protest and looking at whitey as evil.  The Teach for America kids do their two years and move on and new ones come in, so there is no school continuity.  But hey, the district saves a ton of money on salaries and pensions.</p>
<p>Now that you know the game, put your kids in private school as fast as possible.</p>

		<p>I went to a high school where all the blacks had to do was riot, or threaten to riot, and they got their way.  The white students and teachers were terrified and cowed.  A good high school education was denied me, because of racist, violent blacks.</p>
<p>On the job, I&rsquo;ve seen blacks and Hispanics get affirmative action and special treatment.  While WHITES are expected to work hard, be on time and be dependable, everyone tiptoes around blacks and Hispanics.  While WHITES have to walk on eggshells, blacks and Hispanics can make all the racist statements they want.</p>
<p>Like a poster above, I&rsquo;ve seen every neighborhood I&rsquo;ve ever lived in turn into either a black ghetto or a Latino barrio.  Where I live now, there has been a massive influx of illegals.  I have to live behind bars, afraid to walk down the street.  Latinos blast their music all night long.  Illegal gang members and unlicensed, uninusured, often drunk drivers fill the streets.  I&rsquo;m sure I pay more for everything because of Mexican illegals, their crime, and also black crime.  </p>
<p>Seems to me nonwhites can do whatever they want.  It&rsquo;s whites who have to toe the line.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my white privilege?  I&rsquo;ve never been rich, never inherited anything.  All I&rsquo;ve ever done is work hard, mind my own business, and try to hurt no one.  And now I&rsquo;m told I&rsquo;m a &#8220;privileged&#8221; white who should feel guilty?  Well, they can kiss my you-know-what.  As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, blacks and Hispanics should be apologizing to WHITES for their own racism and lawlessness.  Yeah, I know.  I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What I take from this is that we&rsquo;re all guilty. The only question is how guilty are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this, ALL OF THIS is DESIGNED to instill guilt in WHITES.<br>
As a cleric, I pronounce Absolution for all your sins for being White.</p>
<p>Ego te absolvo.</p>
<p>All joking aside, once I realized that it is ENVY that motivates ALL OF THIS &#8216;economic justice&rsquo; and &#8216;social justice&rsquo; claptrap, I realized like another &#8216;victim&rsquo; of the &#8216;system,&rsquo; I was being USED. Once that realization hit me, I could say:</p>
<p>&#8216;Free at last, free at Last. Thank God Almighty I am free at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their psychological manipulation is ended with me, and to everyone I preach to. I&rsquo;ve awoken from the Matrix, and those sunglassed zombies CAN&rsquo;T STAND IT that more and more of us are doing that very thing.</p>

		<p>As government schools are bending themselves backwards and forwards to preach diversity claptrap  &mdash;  because that&rsquo;s what it is, a pack of lies  &mdash;  REAL education about this country, its institutions and its history is being sent down the memory hole.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh (and yes, I am aware that he is a neo-con of the worst sort) reported on this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Intercollegiate Studies Institute reports that most of the 14,000 students who completed the exam (7,000 seniors and 7,000 freshmen) scored an F on the portion of the test covering basic American history and institutions. </p>
<p>ISI, a conservative non-profit educational organization, has recently published the results of this sweeping survey in a 32-page report entitled &#8216;The Shaping of the American Mind: The Diverging Influences of the College Degree and Civic Learning on American Beliefs.&rsquo; &hellip; Here are a few frightening figures certain to keep you up at night: * 71% of Americans failed the civics knowledge test; * 51% of Americans could not name the three branches of government; * The average score for college seniors on the civics knowledge test was 54.2% (an &#8216;F&rsquo; by any standard); ; * Freshmen at Cornell, Yale, Princeton, and Duke scored better than seniors on the civics knowledge test. * 79% of elected officials that took the civics knowledge quiz did not know the Bill of Rights expressly prohibits the government from establishing a religion.&rsquo; Seventy-nine percent!..&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt now what is NOT being taught in the schools?</p>
<p>We are losing our liberty and our country to an authoritarian Big Government  &mdash;  how can we get it back if our young people are learning about &#8216;diversity&rsquo; over what it is that made this country, America, the freest, most prosperous civilization EVER on the face of the earth?</p>
<p>Our youth, the next generations, know little about Free Markets (they&rsquo;re taught Free Markets are racist, exploitative and oppressive to &#8216;people of color&rsquo;), the Founding Fathers (racist, old dead White men, irrelevant because they were slave owners), Liberty (which they little understand and certainly do not respect  &mdash;  but will when the last vestiges of it are gone), yet they can spout off about multiculturalism and diversity and its benefits  &mdash;  as they&rsquo;re stifled by Hate Speech laws, punished by satanic taxes, and locked out of careers.</p>
<p>Little do they know how much they have to lose.</p>
<p>We Whites are triangulated against and strangled by the evil msm, academia and the government.  But there are signs, small signs, that White young have had enough and are becoming aware that everything that&rsquo;s been shoved down their throats about diversity and multi-cultulturalism  is madness and an utter lie. They are becoming aware that any money they earn is heavily taxed to pay for a non-White parasitic class.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re becoming aware that the only thing they&rsquo;re good for, according to the USG is as cannon fodder in its overseas wars, nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the thirty five thousand White women raped by black men every year privileged? Is sickle cell anemia an illusion? Is race the only area in the marxist religion where evolution fails, and a miracle made every human on the planet the same? Is the degenerate behavior of blacks in every corner of the world a myth?</p>
<p>Actually Marxism seeks to undo the evolutionary outcome by leveling the playing field through what they term &#8220;justice.&#8221;  What they don&rsquo;t recognize is that this very act will end up contributing to the decline, and universal failure of the entire human race.<br>

		<p>Anti-racism (aka anti-white racism) is being promoted in NFP&rsquo;s, academia and government bodies nation wide.  When the say they want to talk about &#8220;race and racism&#8221; they mean white racism.  Their mantra declares its the only racism in America.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #25.  I have worked in all black and hispanic environments for several years now.  (Sigh, that&rsquo;s where the money is because it seems only white people have real talent in academia.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the blacks can say the &#8220;N&#8221; word all day long.  They can act like utter idiots - throwing things, yelling, doing no work, and the liberal white and jewish women around me say nothing about it.  They try to cover for them and make excuses.  I think half the young white female teachers around here have the hots for some of these thugs as evidenced by how much they touch them and let themselves be touched.</p>
<p>The latinos, some of them are allright and a few are quite nice, but the low class ones act similarly stupid and thuggy and they get away with tons of things no white kid could ever do.</p>
<p>The things I&rsquo;ve seen over the last four years are incredible, surreal and without logical explanation.  I don&rsquo;t mind to live around middle class Asians or caucasian latinos, but anyone else, not a chance.</p>

		<p>There is obviously a systematic effort to deconstruct the white identity by coercing whites to be ashamed of themselves. To blame themselves for all the worlds evils. While I do believe healthy introspection is good for all people as individuals and groups, I think blame whitey has gone into the sado-masocistic range long enough. A good thing rising from this excess of blame whitey&hellip; Is a self realization that I think was being lost by the descendents of western Europe. What indeed makes Europeans different than the other races has been brought to light* The hippie era was a revolt against the Victorian era and it had its good points but as with most movements.. it was populated by more wannabes than ground breakers&hellip;more flesh than reason..FAKERS. The primitivism that these freedom fighters worshiped is not so attractive in reality as it appeared at a distance. The drug cartels, gangland nonsense, guns in schools, pedophile contagens, femminist movements, gay movements and all the other historically &#8220;repressed&#8221; are not necessarilly virtue, socially or fiscally&hellip; as we currently see.                    There is a general agreement that the Third Reich was an extreme reaction born of humiliation&hellip; being the product of an effort to blame (all) the negativity of WWI on the Germans&hellip;thus justifying their enslavement. The effort to enslave the white race in this same dynamic or to coerce them to misceginate out of existence is not founded on Justice. Lets learn from history and not repeat our mistakes. The celebration of Diversity is best achieved by tolerating it.. even if its an over achiever and white.</p>

		<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>&#8220;As teacher educators, we continue to challenge ourselves to provide varied opportunities for teachers as they engage in the exploration of education for social justice. This work is not achieved without challenge. As we present pre-service and practicing teachers with new ideology and experience, we also must acknowledge ourselves as cultural beings continuously encountering and interpreting ideas and interactions. This process of continuous mindfulness and self-examination seats us as co-learners, with each discourse providing opportunity for illumination.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a REAL teacher in a High School I have gone in every day and encouraged my students to think critically and taught them the skills that they needed to communicate in another language.  I introduced them to the cultures of the various peoples who speak Spanish and let them draw their own conclusions and make their own comparisons. Indoctrinating impressionable students with your particular definition of &#8221; social justice&#8221; is egregious. We&rsquo;re supposed to be developing free thinkers; not robots.</p>
<p>One man&rsquo;s social justice is another man&rsquo;s opression.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t a teacher&rsquo;s job to indoctrinate his students nor is it the job of a teacher educator to indoctrinate future teachers and those who do are a disgrace to what was once an honorable profession. <br>
THis is why the Departments of Education are held in such low esteem by the other departments in many Colleges. Most of the education professors whom I had to endure during my post graduate certification courses had never stepped into a high school classroom.</p>

<p>I should modify my syllabus so that there is no penalty for being late to class because one racial group tends to be late to EVERY class.  </p>
<p>I should modify my assignments so that no one has to work with fractions, etc. etc.  As a teacher, what should I do?!  Quite frankly, these suggestions are simply an impossibility to implement.</p>
