			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, FIRE, February 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SAN DIEGO, February 23, 2010  &mdash;  The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and its student government have violated the First Amendment by freezing funds for 33 student media organizations, dissolving the student-run television station, and threatening to punish students involved in a controversy over a party invitation for an event called the &#8220;Compton Cookout.&#8221; Student government president Utsav Gupta has explained that his repressive actions were due to &#8220;fracturing of the student body on an issue&#8221; and &#8220;hateful speech.&#8221; Further, under pressure from state legislators who seek to punish protected speech, UCSD has launched &#8220;aggressive investigations&#8221; into the party invitation. After many students came to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) for help, FIRE has written two letters to UCSD defending the First Amendment both on and off campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSD is detracting from its message of moral outrage by committing so many violations of the First Amendment,&#8221; said FIRE Vice President Robert Shibley. &#8220;UCSD now must undo the damage to free speech and resist the pressure to punish protected expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The invitation for the February 15 party, which first appeared on social networking site Facebook, celebrated racial stereotypes, asked female partygoers to dress as &#8220;ghetto chicks,&#8221; and invited partygoers to &#8220;experience the various elements of life in the ghetto.&#8221; The party reportedly was a DVD release party organized by &#8220;Jiggaboo Jones,&#8221; an African-American &#8220;shock jock&#8221;-style performer whose persona relies on deliberately provocative and offensive expression. Members of UCSD fraternities reportedly were involved in organizing the event.</p>
<p>Last week, several members of the California State Legislature called for the investigation and punishment of those students involved. Among the elected officials urging punishment for protected speech were Speaker-elect John A. Pérez, Speaker Karen Bass, and most of all Assemblymember Isadore Hall, III, who &#8220;want[s] names&#8221; and suspensions or expulsions. UCSD did not rule out punishment and has announced &#8220;aggressive investigations&#8221; into possible disciplinary violations.</p>
<p>FIRE&rsquo;s letter today to UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox points out that the investigation of protected speech is likely a violation of the First Amendment rights of those investigated and urges the school to announce that it will never investigate protected speech.</p>
<p>This is not the only violation of the First Amendment on UCSD&rsquo;s campus. Last Thursday, student organization The Koala broadcast a defense of the party on UCSD&rsquo;s Student Run Television (SRTV), including language that many persons on campus found highly offensive. In response, student government president Utsav Gupta took immediate action to shut down the broadcast and then the entire station because the broadcast was &#8220;deeply offensive and hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>On February 19, Gupta stated publicly that &#8220;[w]e will only open [SRTV] again when we can be sure that such hateful content can never be aired again on our student funded TV station.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gupta also unilaterally froze the funding for 33 student media organizations because of the content of The Koala&rsquo;s expression, stating that he was compelled to act because such expression was &#8220;fracturing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the student body on an issue.&#8221; A Facebook group opposing the &#8220;mass censorship&#8221; currently has more than 1,100 members.</p>
<p>FIRE&rsquo;s letter yesterday to Gupta and Fox points out that these actions violate the constitutional rights of the organizations involved, not least because the student government, Associated Students of UCSD (ASUCSD), is an agent of UCSD and is thus bound by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the name of protecting students from controversial speech, President Gupta has suppressed expression throughout the campus and has alienated hundreds of students, even those who share his moral outrage at the party invitation,&#8221; said Adam Kissel, Director of FIRE&rsquo;s Individual Rights Defense Program. &#8220;UCSD and ASUCSD must immediately restore access to funding for all organizations, put SRTV back on the air, follow the official procedures for handling complaints at SRTV, refrain from investigating or punishing protected speech both on and off campus, and publicly announce that protected speech will never be investigated.&#8221;</p>
<p>FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights, due process, freedom of expression, academic freedom, and rights of conscience at our nation&rsquo;s colleges and universities. FIRE&rsquo;s efforts to preserve liberty on campuses across America are described at thefire.org.</p>

<p>My goodness. They must have just discovered there is not a single racial special interest group on campus for white students. A university that prides itself on diversity can no longer condone such a glaring omission! </p>

		<p>There is no way someone with the last name Gupta, which is Indian, should be holding student government executive powers in the United States.</p>
<p>What he finds &#8220;hurtful&#8221; would be inherently different from what I would find to be hurtful, and we would probably act differently regardless of whether we agreed. </p>

		<p>Here is some information on this Isadore Hall character from the state of California legislative webpage:</p>
<p>http://www.assembly.ca.gov/acs/makebio.asp?district=52</p>
<p>&#8220;Hall received a Bachelor of Art&rsquo;s Degree in Business Administration from the University of Phoenix and a Master of Arts Degree in Public Administration from National University&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, folks, there is the root of this man&rsquo;s anger! He&rsquo;s using his legislative position to vent at University of California San Diego   &mdash;   a school that is predominantly White and Asian.</p>
<p>A ten year old could get a degree from the University of Phoenix   &mdash;   the same &#8220;university&#8221; that has been indicted for printing out degrees for the &#8220;right price&#8221; to people who paid enough. On top of that, these students are notorious for copying and cheating on their tests and homework. &#8220;National University&#8221; is a complete joke also. <br>

		<p>It seems Fox and Gupta [protest too much, me thinks].</p>
<p>These type of mental midgets actually are our best friends. They do more for our cause than they know. Remember, all the students are watching. They know this is repression clear and simple. It&rsquo;s good that the students see this type of thing in its pure nakedness. It helps our cause immensely.</p>

		<p>Unlike a faculty member, who it could be argued, as a paid employee of the college, has a certain responsibility to represent the college in favorable light, even off duty.  A student really has no responsibility and thus should not be punished for off campus antics.  That being said one still wonders what they were thinking.  Do they not keep up with current events?  Are they not aware of the need for racial and ethnic sensitivity?  Over reaction on the schools side, stupidity on the students side.<br>

		<p>If several hundred White parents pulled their kids out of that college and file a class action, all this nonsense would stop.  They should state that they fear for their childrens safety due to the racially charged environment created by the black students, and are there for not getting the education they&rsquo;re paying for. Whites should pull their kids out of these diversity eutopias in droves, and tell them why. Hurt them in the wallet, that always gets their attention. Let their campuses fill up with thugs - oops - &#8220;underserved minority youth&#8221;, and sit back and watch the liberals get their just reward.    </p>

		<p> Kudos to FIRE for its courageous and aggressive stand in favor of individual and free speech rights. But pointing out to the pointy-heads that what they are doing is unconstitutional will not, in and of itself, force a retreat. FIRE must be prepared to warn these people that, absent said retreat and a &#8220;making whole&#8221; of the people whose rights they have violated, it may become necessary to take legal action against the university.</p>
<p> THAT&rsquo;S what they understand. Get into their wallets, which is to say, the wallets of the alumni, big time, every time they try something like this. The alumni will definitely not like actions that lead to such expensive lawsuits!</p>

		<p>These Marxists types will ban a speaker or viewpoint under the pretense of supporting free speech - much the way they discriminate under the auspices of fighting discrimination. As long as they continue to keep white speakers or white racial interest groups off campus (or control their activities) they will continue to so. They&rsquo;ll continue to hate while posing as the heroic saviors fighting hatred. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that, so far, the students haven&rsquo;t caved.  They must be getting good advice from their parents and their lawyers.  This seems to me to be an open and shut First Amendment case.  The university administration must know they can&rsquo;t do anything if the students stand firm, but this Gupta bozo is clueless.  </p>
<p>BTW, anything come of that noose in the hallway?  If they&rsquo;re not even talking about it, they must know that a Black did it.  If they thought they could hang it on a &#8220;racist&#8221;, they&rsquo;d still be making a stink, getting as much milage as they could.</p>

		<p>The current situation is starting to bear  some resemblance to the totalitarian police state that existed in the US during the latter part of the Wilson administration.  Then the targets were war critics -or even those  deemed insufficiently enthusiastic about the war-and German-Americans. Now the targets are whites suspected of being insufficiently anti-white. </p>
<p>Of course, there are major differences: one is that  the govt can&rsquo;t OFFICIALLY declare war against  whites like they declared war against Germany. So the hysteria is less intense- no mass roundups, detentions without trials or lynchings. But something along these lines could happen when suspected White Nationalists (and the term would no doubt be broadly construed) <br>
are declared Enemy Combatants under the PATRIOT Act. </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #9.  Given that our backs are to the wall now, we have nothing to lose in promoting integration in every sphere controlled by liberals, and this includes newspapers, colleges and grade schools.  </p>
<p>Conservatives will create informal networks to serve their own, if done right it can be very successful.  We need to push hard for these liberal institutions to take in as many &#8220;underserved&#8221; as possible, especially in the employment realm.  </p>
<p>Begin campaigns against liberal departments until every last employee is non-white.  Get those white liberals fired to right past injustices.  Flood schools in liberal neighborhoods with the &#8216;disadvantaged.&rsquo; And do not sell homes in your peaceful, well-ordered neighborhood except by word of mouth.  Do not use realtors, because that invites the &#8216;discrimanashun&rsquo; crowd.</p>
<p>Private schools and colleges can still be salvaged in many areas.  Do not hire any illegals, even for lawn work, and do not patronize any business that does.  Organize local boycotts.  Your town must eliminate all welfare benefits and instead rely on local informal networks.  There is a way to turn the tide, by self-insulating and giving the liberals what they want - in their own neighborhoos en masse, and then keeping them from escaping to yours.</p>
