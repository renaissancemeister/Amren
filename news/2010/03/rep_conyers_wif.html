			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AOL News, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As guards cleared the packed courtroom, Monica Conyers yelled that she planned to appeal. The wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., wanted to withdraw her guilty plea, suggesting she was the victim of &#8220;badgering&#8221; last year when she admitted taking cash to support a Houston company&rsquo;s sludge contract with the city.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn, reviewing a transcript of the June hearing, said Conyers had denied any coercion and voluntarily pleaded guilty to conspiracy.</p>
<p>Conyers, 45, is the biggest catch so far in the FBI&rsquo;s wide-ranging investigation of corruption in Detroit city government. Nine people have pleaded guilty, including two former directors of the downtown convention center, and prosecutors have promised more charges are coming.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Conyers&rsquo; plea deal was limited to taking bribes to support a contract with Synagro worth $47 million a year. But the recent trial of her former aide, Sam Riddle, exposed a series of alleged schemes involving others making payoffs to do business at city hall.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Riddle and Conyers collected $69,500 by shaking people down and urged Cohn to consider the alleged crimes when sentencing her. Defense lawyer Steve Fishman firmly objected and demanded a separate hearing.</p>
<p>Conyers declared, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to jail for something I didn&rsquo;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The sentence will be based solely on conviction,&#8221; Cohn said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, jurors at the Riddle trial heard secretly taped phone calls in which he and Conyers discussed money, bank deposits and how to split cash.</p>
<p>In a November 2007 call, Conyers told Riddle, &#8220;You&rsquo;d better get my loot.&#8221; On another call, businessman Rayford Jackson, who passed bribes to Conyers for her sludge vote, said, &#8220;You&rsquo;re my girl. Don&rsquo;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conyers told the judge some taped conversations would exonerate her.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have taken tapes and used them out of context,&#8221; she said of the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office. &#8220;I will take the blame for things I did do.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The truth is just the opposite   &mdash;   The reason I give this guilty verdict a lot of credibility is that there surely had to be blacks on the jury, though since it was a Federal trial, they could draw jurors from places other than Detroit and Wayne County.  Since they got a guilty verdict, the blacks on the jury had to have voted to convict a black politician in a black city. </p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t something you didn&rsquo;t do.  It&rsquo;s something you did do.</p>
<p>But what can be expected of a racist society that throws blacks in jail, because they&rsquo;re a threat to the white power structure?</p>
<p>See?  I gave you a ready made comment for your next interview.</p>

		<p>Very surprising that she got any jail time, although she won&rsquo;t do 3 years.  She probably thought she would not go to jail when she denied coercion.  She took a plea deal and now wants the court to consider tapes that will &#8220;clear&#8221; her.  Not surprising, she wants her second bite of the apple.</p>

<p>Well, that is the sort of terminology that reputable public officials use when they discuss governing a city, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>How typical that even a supposed &#8216;high class&rsquo; black can&rsquo;t control her behavior in a setting such as a courtroom. They must have oversized screaming and hollering genes.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that this case was federal.  In federal prison, one must serve at least 7/8 of one&rsquo;s sentence, even with maximum time off for good behavior.  There is absolutely no parole available in the federal prison system for anyone convicted after approximately 1986 - the only federal inmates one hears about getting parole hearings are those locked up since before then (typically for murder, given the time that has elapsed since 1986.)  If Conyers received exactly 36 months, she will have to do at least 31.5 months of that.  Up to 3.5 months of this (and at least one month) can be in a halfway house.  This makes completely the &#8220;split-sentence&#8221; (half in a camp and half at home on an ankle monitor) that Martha Stewart received unavailable.</p>
<p>With this sentence for a non-violent first offence, Conyers will serve her time at a federal prison camp (a minimum-security facility).</p>

		<p>Like a lot of items on AmRen, I just do not see the racial angle of this one, except for the fact that the defendant happens to be black. I don&rsquo;t even see anywhere where it says she was trotting out the old, &#8220;they are just doing this to me because I am black&#8221; defense.  </p>
