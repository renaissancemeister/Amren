<h1><a href="https://www.wcsh6.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=115774&amp;catid=2">Petition Drive Held For Non-Citizen Voting Rights</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Wheeler, WCSH-TV (Portland, Maine), March 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The League of Young Voters and Portland&rsquo;s immigrant community are teaming up, pushing for voting rights for legal immigrants.</p>
<p>The city of Portland is home to nearly 7,000 legal immigrants, who make up almost 10% of the city&rsquo;s population. Legal immigrants pay taxes into the city, own businesses, and send their children to Portland schools. They use many of the services available to United States citizens, but have no say in how their tax money is spent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The League of Young Voters, along with several members of Portland&rsquo;s immigrant community have formulated a petition drive. They will have until July 14th to gather just over 5,000 signatures to have the question put on the November ballot. If the question does pass, immigrants would have to prove they are in the country legally, and even then would only be allowed to vote in citywide elections.<br>

		<p>Well that&rsquo;s one way to ensure that nobody ever wants to be a citizen.  After all, if immigrants can vote without being citizens but are never under the threat of a resurrection of the military draft, that makes actual citizens second class citizens.<br>

		<p>This article is pro-immigrant.  True, some legal immigrants may pay taxes, etc.  But, nothing says they have to be here.  Letting them vote dilutes the voting power of U.S. citizens.  But, they will prevail on the left coast.</p>

		<p>You or I do not qualify for &#8216;in-state tuition&rsquo; if we are not legal residents of the state in which the college we apply to is located, so, too late, we are second class citizens already. And I cannot speak for elsewhere, but here in NC, many community colleges will not accept Legal Immigrants, because the school cannot afford to enforce the monitoring etc. they are required to perform with regard to Legal alien students&hellip; but they take Illegals with no hesitation. Talk about warped.</p>

		<p>The League of Young Voters bravely addresses the immigrant citizen shortage: </p>
<p>Not having enough citizen voters who were recent immigrants, or longer-term arrival immigrants, or family chained-in immigrants, or earlier amnestied illegal aliens, or earlier winners of Diversity Lotteries, or countless refugee programs, or the result of decades of offspring of all the above, the highly intelligent, and not at all blithering, League of Young Voters is simply addressing the overall legal and illegal immigrant voter shortage. The group&rsquo;s next exciting project will be to add as many teaspoons of table salt as possible to the Salton Sea. Since real life experiences are said to bring about more wisdom, maybe the name of the group could be more accurately changed to the &#8220;League of Excessively Young Voters.&#8221;<br>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t those same &#8220;services&#8221; paid for BY taxes? I also suspect that their tax contribution is negligible in one of the 1 step forward, 2 steps back in that they pay $100 in taxes yet reap $10,000 in benefits and freebies for which we, mostly, White taxpaying slaves pick up the tab for the rest.</p>

		<p>Portland has around 575,000 people.  7000 foreigners do not amount to ten percent of the city&rsquo;s population.  What other falsehoods is the writer pushing?<br>

		<p>Citizens voting to allow non-citizens (even tax-paying ones) to vote is like shareholders in a company voting to dilute the stock by giving it away to the company&rsquo;s customers.  It&rsquo;s unlikely to happen without some serious irrationality coming into play.</p>

<p>I suspect the &#8220;League of Young Voters&#8221; is in the same league as various &#8220;Junior Chambers of Commerce.&#8221;  Meaning that &#8220;young and &#8220;junior&#8221; means under the age of 45.  If they are &#8220;young&#8221; as in under 25, then you can bet there are old people behind what they are doing.</p>

		<p>This actually might not be a bad idea, they should have them show some proper ducumentation, then maybe they could load &#8216;em up an&rsquo; move&rsquo;m out. Oh! sorry I forgot this is AmeriKa, and they would fall under the defination of [MINORITIES] and therefore would be exempt from any proescution under the laws of the peoples communist republiK. So instead, they may load up all the dissident patriotic white subjects and incarcerate &#8220;them.&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure that is in the works. Plus if they can come up with a plan maybe his majesty the big &#8220;O&#8221; can sign another directive, allowing all foreign freedom haters to vote absentee ballots, therein insuring the absolute change he is seeking. Oh! wait I don&rsquo;t guess they need a PLAN. Just a few strokes of our glorious totalitarian dictator leader&rsquo;s pen would suffice. All knees will bend, and all heads will bow to the king. No, my mistake, I beleive that was said about &#8220;THE REAL KING.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Regarding Comment #6:</p>
<p>The City of Portland, Maine, has a population of about 64,000 people.  7,000 non-citizen immigrants would be approx. 11& of the population.  Your right, it&rsquo;s not 10%.  It&rsquo;s more.  It&rsquo;s closer to 11%.  LMAO</p>

		<p>11 Anon: I stand corrected.  I didn&rsquo;t read the italics.  I sometimes forget that there&rsquo;s a Portland in Maine, as well as Oregon.  It pains me to see that the Eastern Portland has the same sort of twisted multicults that the Western one has.  <br>
