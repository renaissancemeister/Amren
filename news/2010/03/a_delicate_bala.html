<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/us/19cncagenda.html">A Delicate Balancing Act for the Black Agenda</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Don Terry, New York Times, March 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as the economic crisis continues to slam black America disproportionately hard, while bonuses rain down on Wall Street, the debate has spilled into the open and will get its loudest and most public hearing yet on Saturday, in a forum held just a few miles from Mr. Obama&rsquo;s house in Kenwood, at Chicago State University.</p>
<p>Tavis Smiley, an author and talk show host and a frequent  &mdash;  and until recently rare  &mdash;  black critic of the president, is scheduled to convene a panel of civil rights leaders and scholars called &#8220;We Count: The Black Agenda Is the American Agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion will be nationally televised on C-Span, and the invited panelists include Cornel West, a Princeton University professor; Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</p>
<p>&#8220;A black agenda is jobs, jobs, jobs, quality education, investment in infrastructure and strong democratic regulation of corporations,&#8221; Dr. West said. &#8220;The black agenda, at its best, looks at America from the vantage point of the least of thee and asks what&rsquo;s best for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} But since announcing the event last month, Mr. Smiley and the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Mr. Obama&rsquo;s most vocal supporters  &mdash;  &#8220;Barack&rsquo;s pet preacher,&#8221; as one Chicago activist put it  &mdash;  have conducted a sometimes heated debate on black radio about the wisdom of convening the &#8220;We Count&#8221; panel discussion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Barack is ignoring the black community,&#8221; said Ms. Hartman [Hermene D. Hartman, publisher of the weekly N&rsquo;Digo newspaper in Chicago.]. &#8220;{snip} Trickle down is not trickling down.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Tavis Smiley has been pretty much a &#8220;nobody&#8221; here in LA, where he had his little PBS TV show for a few years.  He desperately wants to get into the national picture, and is trying to do it via the Al Sharpton/Jesse Jackson method:  play up black victim mentality and entitlement demands.  That&rsquo;s why he is on the docket with better known black agitators like Louis Farrakhan.  Tavis wants his name to be a household word like Jesse and Al.  Blacks are far too immature to understand that B.O. is the president of ALL the people, not just for the blacks, and he is not there to give them special privileges.  So they are going to raise hell and get real loud at this gathering; hopefully the world will realize that it&rsquo;s just a lot of hot air.</p>

		<p>In a white country, black people should be ignored.  They have no say in how the country&rsquo;s run, they contribute nothing, and they&rsquo;re always complaining and griping about &#8216;racism&rsquo;, whites, the government, and anything else that reminds them of their inferiority.  Oh, plus they don&rsquo;t pay a big chunk of the taxes.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Black leaders: &ldquo;Barack Obama is ignoring the black community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, their greed is showing for all to see, because this pro-black community organizer wants the healthcare bill passed, because it means free insurance for all blacks.  It also contains mandates that non-white quotas will have to filled in med schools despite a lack of qualifications, and there&rsquo;s a government mandate included that stipulates the government&hellip;not banks&hellip;.will handle student loans.</p>
<p>Could it be possible it&rsquo;s because the brothers and sisters have all complained that the banks require applicants to be credit worthy enough to pay them back, which excludes many blacks who dropout and never repay their loans?</p>
<p>With the government handling these loans, they will make certain white kids get only a token few and the brothers and sisters will get the lion&rsquo;s share to make up for all the years of perceived injustice.</p>
<p>The corruption is staggering.  Only an arrogant black would attempt such blatant outrages.</p>

		<p>White Nationalists can win. <br>
	<br>
Every white nationalist must become politically involved; simply by becoming delegates to republican and democratic parties we can easily control both parties; we have the numbers but we must act quickly.<br>
	<br>
I&rsquo;m a delegate&hellip; who has introduced several party planks; one of my planks called for an end to&hellip; (Affirmative Action) happily, the plank was avowed in every county in my state.<br>
	<br>
We can make a difference.<br>

		<p>&#8220;But too many homes have been lost to foreclosure, too many fathers have lost jobs, too many mothers are losing hope for his most loyal bloc to be happy with what many are now saying is more symbolism than substance coming from Mr. Obama&rsquo;s administration in regard to black America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many fathers&#8221;? How stupid do they think we are?  The main problem in the Black community is that there are too few fathers.</p>
<p>The beat goes on after more than half a century of entitlements, special school programs, free lunches, midnight basketball, outreach programs, unrealistic portrayals of Blacks in the media (all intended as some sort of stimulus for Blacks to want to improve themselves) and self flagellation by guilty Whites. Nothing has changed. In fact it has gotten worse at an almost exponential rate.</p>
<p>Violent, atrocious Black on White crime has become a daily reality. Black on Black crime is ever increasing. States and cities are approaching economic catastrophe due to sociopathic Black behavior. Businesses are leaving cities, productive people are fleeing. The &#8220;justice system&#8221; is hamstrung. Prisons are at the bursting point. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Black community. The President is looking out for you.  He&rsquo;s simply being &#8220;cool&#8221; about it so as not to alert the mind numbed White community as to what&rsquo;s in store for them. Health care is merely the first step.</p>

		<p>Lest anyone think large numbers of blacks are turning against Obama please recall that Smiley and Jealous Jesse Jackson disliked him long before he was elected.</p>
<p>Farrakhan and Cornel West are black militants but to their credit aren&rsquo;t Democratic Party hacks, unlike most black &#8220;leaders&#8221; and that explains why Obama hasn&rsquo;t been widely criticized by his own people so far. </p>

		<p>I wonder how Tavis Smiley, Jesse Jackson, Cornel West and all the other shake down whitey race hustlers got this evil, racist event past the radar of ol&rsquo; Jeffrey Imm, One People&rsquo;s Project and the &#8220;Self Described Anarchist Collective?<br>
How did Chicago State University&rsquo;s switchboards not short circut with all of the harassment and death threats being phoned in and all?</p>

		<p>Cornel West, Farrakhan, Jackson, basically all the usual suspects.  Nothing changes.</p>
<p>Actually I&rsquo;d argue this is the first post-racial moment I&rsquo;ve seen.  Obama may be the first black president, but being president he&rsquo;s still just a pinata for these folks to whack and see if any goodies fall out.</p>
<p>Apparently race-hustling has become color blind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Strong democratic regulation of corporations&#8221;  - that is what is needed in the opinion of Cornel West. Capitalism and the free market are the culprits. We must let Washington bureaucrats manage our economy. Decide who works, who gets promoted, how much companies can charge for their products and services, how much return stockholders get on their investments, amount and kinds of fringe benefits offered and so forth. Yes, Cornel, that is what is needed.</p>

		<p>This is truly a meeting of the finest example of a superb panel of extremely intelligent, racially tolerant, unbiased, lovely black gentlemen we have here. With people as kind and well spoken as these it&rsquo;s no wonder the races get along so wonderfully, Oh if only Mr. Taylor have could come up with such a wonderful group of speakers such as these for the recent Amren meeting, surely nothing negative would have ever been said. I&rsquo;m sure all our liberal friends will find all this to be so true.</p>

		<p>Who didn&rsquo;t believe it would become this way? It&rsquo;s the best thing that could happen - the &#8216;black community&rsquo; become disenchanted with their black president. Let&rsquo;s see the wrath of Africa America become focused on one of their own. Nothing short of giving every single one of them every single thing they want; getting every single one of them out of self-created trouble would please them, and even then it&rsquo;s a fine line. No human could do it. But white rage will be  construed as racist and ignored, so only black rage against this so-called President will be legitimate.</p>
