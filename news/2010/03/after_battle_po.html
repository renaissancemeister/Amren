<h1><a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/28/nation/la-na-hometown-portland28-2010feb28">After Battle, Portland Renames Street After Cesar Chavez</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Baxter Holmes, Los Angeles Times, February 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chanting started at the front of the church, a full-throated belt from a man pumping his fist from behind the lectern.</p>
<p>Si se puede! Si se puede! Yes we can! Yes we can!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just below the man sat the reason for their chanting: a huge representation of a street sign, 7 feet long, 2 feet tall, green with white letters reading &#8220;Cesar E. Chavez Blvd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three years. That&rsquo;s how long it took to get a street here renamed after the labor leader and human rights activist. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been horrible,&#8221; said Marta Guembes, co-chairwoman of the Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard Committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A key dispute: Why not rename a park or bridge? But the committee wanted a street. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks each had one, as did local developer and civic leader Bill Naito.</p>
<p>Finally, after much dispute, the City Council voted 5 to 0 last July to rename 39th Avenue  &mdash;  a seven-mile stretch that passes about 650 homes and upscale stretches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having been through three of them, street renamings are inherently one of the most controversial things a city can go through,&#8221; Portland Mayor Sam Adams said.</p>
<p>{snip} William Schneider, a chiropractor whose office is located on 39th, had spearheaded the opposition group for financial and historical reasons. He liked the history of the street and didn&rsquo;t want his business address to change.</p>
<p>His e-mail list had about 150 people opposed to the new street name, mostly for similar reasons. But the motivations of some people who attempted to join his group disturbed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people I talked to, some of the racism I saw, I was pretty astounded,&#8221; Schneider said.</p>

		<p>39th Avenue in Portland, OR,  is in an upscale neighborhood of white people, one of my sisters is among them. Why this street? They should have renamed 181st Avenue. That is in Gresham in a Hispanic neighborhood. The local residents would have been thrilled to pieces, I&rsquo;m sure!</p>

		<p>Well, we all know that Mexicans are trying to elevate one of their own to Martin Luther King status. The thing is, from what I have read Chavez was against illegal immigration knowing it hurt farm laborers and drove down wages.</p>

		<p>In San Francisco, Army street was renamed Caesar Chavez, after 134 years.I dont have anything against Caesar Chavez, but I do not like renaming streets after such a long time. </p>

		<p>Out of shear rabidity-and an innate hatred of Whites-Mexicans will be exercizing thier coming political influence and power.  They will erase the Europen-American-cultural-influences of our people. </p>
<p>Now, I do not want to live around these people; I have had enough time-living amongst them-that I would rather be water-boarded than watch anything with George Lopez. </p>

		<p>I know a couple who live on 39th. Needless to say most people who reside on the street weren&rsquo;t happy. </p>
<p>This was nothing more than pandering to a small minority. Thats why it took so long to come to pass. Most citizens thought it was a stupid idea as Chavez only visited Portland once and had really no real connection to the town. So it was fought tooth and nail. </p>
<p>To show how unpopular the renaming was, the City Council actually passed it somewhat underhandedly. The final city meeting for comments and the vote was rescheduled on short notice, so only the city council and just a few citizens were on hand when they voted.  </p>

		<p>Unless Cesar Chavez built and payed for 39th Ave., it should stay 39th Ave. If the name has to change it should be named after the majority of the Portland residents that keep the street maintained with their tax money.  And that name is Caucasian.</p>

		<p>The number one omission from Chavez&rsquo;s memory is this, &#8220;He hated and fought against illegals.&#8221;  How could he organize his thug union with illegals (scabs) coming over and doing the work his people were on strike from doing?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rewrite history, please.</p>
<p>I did eat all the lettuce I could in the late sixties while in California.  </p>

		<p>This guy did the grape boycott thing and protested against pesticide use.  I don&rsquo;t understand why every white person who does things like this doesn&rsquo;t get a street named after them.  Are there any Rachel Carson Street campaigns out there?  (Silent Spring).  How about others?  I don&rsquo;t begrudge people having heroes and such, it&rsquo;s just he seems like such an underwhelming insignificant man of limited accomplishments to rally around.  Why not an Aztec Way or Mayan Blvd?  At least those people built civilizations.</p>

		<p>My office is half a block from my city&rsquo;s newly-renamed Cesar Chavez Boulevard.  Except for the new name written in tiny letters above the original name, you would never know the name had changed at all.  Everyone in town still calls it by its old, historic name, but the Hispanic activists seem to feel they got a victory anyway.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Avenue of the Americas&#8221; has had that name for sixty years&hellip; and every one <i>still</i> calls it &#8220;Sixth Avenue&#8221;.  A bit farther downtown is Houston Street.  This is named for an obscure Georgian rather than a famous Texan.  And his obscure pronunciation survives.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Illinois Avenue on the Monopoly board no longer exists in the real world.  Atlantic City changed it to (what else?) MLK.  </p>
<p>If Manhattanites can stick to their guns, why not everyone else?</p>

		<p>MLK in Portland is still called Grand on some blocks and Union on others. Nobody I know supported the name change on 39th. </p>
