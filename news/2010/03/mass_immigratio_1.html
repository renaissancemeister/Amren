<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>TRADITIONS based on heritage, sporting culture and common language are threatened by mass immigration, a leading demographer has warned.</p>
<p>Monash University population expert Dr Bob Birrell has said the huge influx of people with few or no English skills had created social problems in Melbourne suburbs such as Dandenong, Sunshine and Broadmeadows and most major cities were feeling the population strain, the Herald Sun reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a pretty picture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Social divisions are becoming more obvious and geographically concentrated and certain areas are being overlain by an ethnic identification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Birrell made the explosive comments in an article for Policy, a magazine published by the Centre for Independent Studies, a right-wing think tank.</p>
<p>In a plea to the Rudd Government to slash the current immigrant intake of 180,000 a year, Dr Birrell warned that the predicted population of 35 million by 2050 would be a disaster for urban living and the environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would have to wander deaf, dumb and blind through Australian capital cities to not notice how urban congestion has already reduced the quality of life,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The intake dominated by people from non-English speaking backgrounds was transforming Australia, Dr Birrell said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are losing core elements of what was once shared. Almost all could once aspire to a house and land .&nbps;.&nbsp;. and sharing a common language, sporting culture and heritage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But mass migration was creating ethnic enclaves in suburbs with cheap housing, and planning rules were forcing Australian-born &#8220;losers&#8221; and non-English speaking background migrants to live in congested neighbourhoods, &#8220;cheek by jowl&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Population target</b></p>
<p>Kevin Rudd has made it clear that he believes in a big Australia. In a recent speech he declared that migration was &#8220;good for our national security, good for our long-term prosperity, good in enhancing our role in the region and the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the Federal Opposition and the Greens said questions needed to be asked about Australia&rsquo;s immigration plans.</p>
<p>Opposition immigration spokesman, Scott Morrison, told the ABC there should be an inquiry into how many people the nation can support.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about what the carrying capacity is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to get that perspective from regional areas as well as metropolitan areas, where issues of congestion and housing affordability are major problems as well as public transport.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s more important, is the process for planning. For example, the states and territories have no input into questions of immigration and migration intakes but they&rsquo;re the ones at the end of the day that have to service the needs that are created by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greens Leader Bob Brown said there should be an independent national inquiry into Australia&rsquo;s population target.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that politicians do have an idea of the carrying capacity of this country, its infrastructure, its ability to deal with those quite worrying projections of 35 million people by 2050,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to do better than just say well let it happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other leading academics have also questioned the challenge that mass intake of migrants will pose.</p>
<p>In their book Australia&rsquo;s Immigration Revolution, Andrew Markus, James Jupp and Peter McDonald agrue that while immigration &#8220;offers &#8216;the most immediate and simplest short term measure to deal with labour and skills shortages&#8221; it also comes with serious questions about social cohesion.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1950s 80 per cent of immigrants came from the United Kingdom. Between the 50s and the 1960s migrants from continental Europe became the majority.</p>
<p>After the abolition of the White Australia policy in the early 1970s the mixture of migration changed again. Today, the largest proportion of immigrants come from Asia and Oceania. China and India rival New Zealand and Britian as the biggest source of immigrants.<br>

		<p>A brave opinion by Mr Birrell. I spent some time today reading the comments on this article on an online Australian news site. <br>
Most comments supported Mr Birrell, but a few White liberals whined about the indigenous aborigines and how the evil Whites stole their land and have no right to complain about what is happening in now. I often hear the same complaint lodged against American anti-immigrant groups by White liberals here. <br>
The stupidity of this view is easy to counter: Both the native Australian and the Native American was doing almost nothing with the land prior to the arrival of White colonists.  All the cities, roads, monuments, canals, airports, univeristies, etc. were built by White men for the use of a White civilization. Now these cultural riches are being handed over root and branch to alien invaders who have contributed nothing to the original civilization. The White man builds civilization and Asians, Indians, Mestizos, and Africans reap the benefits. </p>

		<p>All the Aussies have to do is take a look at France or Britain and see what&rsquo;s in store for them if they don&rsquo;t limit immigration now.  Of course, it&rsquo;s a great deal for immigrants; my niece&rsquo;s brother gets something like $500 or more per month from the Aussie guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t for every kid he and his wife have, and so far they&rsquo;ve produced 7 kids.  He doesn&rsquo;t work; his wife works as a teacher, and they collect plenty of money to raise their children.  So it&rsquo;s obviously a great deal for immigrants who don&rsquo;t want to work and are willing to produce many children.</p>

		<p>Actually I was watching an episode of No reservations with Anthony Bourdain. He was talking with an elderly chinese man. Anthony was droning on about how wonderful diversity and multiculturalism was in Australia. The chinese mans reply was &#8221; We dont want to talk about that&#8221;. Apparently the chinese have figured out  that they are not welcomed by the Natives. Good thing it was not a Lebanese. He might have gotten a knife in the gut.</p>

<p>I have an even easier counterargument: had the Indians and the Aborigines not permitted immigration, they would still be the sole owners of their continents today.<br>

		<p>A tip of the hat to those who have been telling us all along that this was a world-wide conspiracy, a NWO.  Whatever one calls it, it is the death of the West.  Certainly anyone with a somewhat open mind can see that the socialists/communists have made considerable headway in the destruction of conservative whites.  Of course we are at one minute to twelve and our end is just over the horizon.  No sweeping election success can restore what has already been done.  For instance, how would one propose to move upwards of 30 million illegals out of the US?  It is the same for Australia, France, Great Britain, etc.  While we slept they made of with the nations&rsquo; jewels.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to see Bob Birrell coming in on the right side of the debate, but he has been a part of the problem for a long time. It seems Rudd&rsquo;s lunacy has pushed Birrell to the verge of sanity. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism and the end of the White Australia Policy was just part of a programme that can be traced back to Lyndon Johnson, who brought in an Immigration Reform Act in 1965. Australia was more easily coerced than other western countries because we were allies of the US in Vietnam. Australia might not have opened its borders except for the Vietnam War. Gough Whitlam was opposed to Indochinese boat people, calling them Vietnamese Balts. </p>
<p>Since then, the Western world has been hoodwinked by half-baked arguments about demography and low birth rates, as even the third world waves of unskilled migrants will willingly pay taxes for pensions for aged Europeans. It&rsquo;s very rare to see these people, visible ethnic minorities, doing any volunteer work or work community services. </p>
<p>But it probably is not possible to reverse immigration trends without support from the larger governments of Europe and North America. The same laws and policies are enforced in all wealthy countries, as if there is a collective will to self-destruct. This may be the year, 2010, when the number of children born to minorities in the US is greater than those born to Americans of European heritage. </p>
<p>One easy way to make immigration palatable and benign is to source white Africans, but even then not in the numbers Rudd advocates. Australia should be offering humanitarian assistance to White South Africans. These people, along with white Rhodesians, have average IQs close to 120, because they are a select and able group. The white people in Rhodesia could harvest 1,000 bushells from a hectare of land where the blacks are unable to harvest 10 bushells, or a yield of 1% in contrast to previous output.</p>
<p>South Africa was a prosperous country where there was a lot more respect for law and order. The blacks knew the consequences of crossing certain boundaries. Now they murder each other if they come from different tribes or have fled from Mugabe across the river. They are killing whites, usually the most vulnerable who have been displaced by so-called affirmative action. There are 1,000 reported rapes every week. Medicine for AIDS is not distributed because of Mbeke&rsquo;s superstitions. </p>
<p>South Africa and Rhodesia decry the whites who leave these once functioning colonies because they know they can&rsquo;t run their countries without them. Yet they refuse to recognise the white people&rsquo;s abilities to bring progress and order to the country. These were the people who built these countries and made them viable and prosperous.</p>
<p>These African whites are displaced people of ability with a lot more to offer Australia than the Sri Lankan freeloaders who squatted on the Ocean Viking, or the Afghanis who set fire to their boats as the RAN comes into view. White Africans will not make Centrelink their first stop before applying at the Housing Commission for emergency housing, as is the cultural practice of swarthy refugees from the third world.</p>
<p>White South Africans would be an asset, with similar cultural mores and customs to the bulk of Australians. Though they have been victimised for over 15 years, they will not inflict a culture of victimhood on Australia, but a culture of contribution to the commonwealth.</p>
<p>The lunatic voices that call for a swarthier Australia are powerful, and would scoff at such immigration. Luckily though, saner voices are becoming louder.</p>

		<p>With tomorrows Earth Hour I&rsquo;d like to remind everyone in Australia who reads this to turn all your lights on to protest the 3rd world imigration to Australia.</p>
<p>The western world already had its answer to global warming (if it&rsquo;s real) with a naturally reducing population and increasing efficencies due to increasing cost of energy.</p>
<p>Instead politicians like Krudd have compounded the problem by bringing in unchecked numbers of imigrants from the 3rd world.  Each imigrant increase their carbon footprint by about 16 times.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide doesn&rsquo;t cause global warming.  People cause global warming, carbon dioxide is simply a byproduct.  Bringing in these 3rd worlders doesn&rsquo;t just increase their consumption of energy it also removes the motivation to improve the conditions of the country they came from by giving them an easy out.</p>
<p>Time to stop the never ending cycle of PC/socialist decline.</p>

<p>are right on the ball as I know those areas quite well and the flood of Africans and other third worlders  are creating real racial tensions and and an atmosphere where  race riots are almost  a certainty in the near future.  <br>
  Melbourne was a great city to live in but the absolute idiocy of massive immigration including a generous allocation of third<br>
world `refugees`and the lack of  investment in infrastructure<br>
are causing real headaches,esp urban congestion and transportation<br>
 I almost feel in some of these comments that  Bob Birrell    <br>
is really saying `third world mass migration is killing Aussie culture.`Hence  by straddling the political correct fence he is daring to say how things are and echoing the sentiments of many who live here in Melbourne without actually declaring an end to<br>
this insane migration policy and being labelled the ultimate <br>
taboo word&hellip;racist.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m an international post. grad. science student at Monash uni and I can see what Dr. Birrell talks about. In my course there are about 65 percent Chinese, 25 percent Indians and maybe one out of ten is European or Australian European. The education sector is however the third largest business here and the Aussies would have to lower their living standard drastically if the government should reimplement the &#8220;White Australia&#8221; policies. The economy in Melbourne is totally geared towards international students. </p>
<p>If Dr. Birrell should find the courage to move to a inner city part of a major European town he would understand that Chinese and Indians are indeed civilized folks one can do business with. I am stoked to live a place where Africans and Muslims are not welcomed(lowest score on the Aussie visa point system).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am unimpressed by the European Aussie kids, I find that the majority want to party, have fun and do happy go lucky. Few of them think abouth their future or getting a good education. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they aren&rsquo;t good sports ;)</p>
<p>All in all my impression is that Australian politicians are much more sane than their western European counterparts. And there is huge, recently arrived, diaspora of virtually every European nation here aswell, that means a lot of people who know the truth about multikulti. In fact, I am pretty optimist on the future of Australia as a European country/nation. </p>

<p>Rudd wants to increase our population to 35 million by 2050 - this can only be done by opening up our borders to the masses. Problem is that the environmentalists have a stranglehold on government policy so it is almost impossible to build the infrastructure (power/water etc.) to deal with the hoards. Australia is in deep trouble.</p>

<p>Deliberate lies. What immigration from the third world is good for, as he well knows and counts on, is block votes for his liberal party that keeps them in power. This is the standard sellout of their country by &#8220;liberal&#8221; politicians who figure that the good hearted population will buy the snake oil.</p>

		<p>Kurt in Post # 6 is correct when he says, &#8220;People cause global warming, carbon dioxide is simply a byproduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fastest way to increase carbon emissions, and thus global warming, is to transfer millions of low-carbon producing Third Worlders into the First World, and then demand that it is now &#8220;racism&#8221; unless these immigrants begin to use resources like First World people.  In Somalia, Wambumbo will burn nearly no gasoline.  In America, Wambumbo will live in a house heated and cooled by fossil fuels, and drive a carbon-emitting SUV.  <br>

		<p>&ldquo;Good for our national security, good for our long-term prosperity, good in enhancing our role in the region and the world�?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deconstruct these 3 lies, which are often espoused during immigration debates:</p>
<p>1) Good for national security: About half of the terrorist acts in the USA and Europe have been perpetrated by &ldquo;immigrants.�?  Is that &ldquo;security�?? As proven by many, many, many cases during the last 50 years, a great many foreign spies reside here as immigrants, and have stolen our military secretes.  Is that &ldquo;security�??  Finally, racial and ethnic diversity is at the root of many wars – examples include Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, and virtually any place in Africa.  Anyone who thinks increasing racial and ethnic diversity aids &ldquo;security�? is a complete idiot!</p>
<p>2) Good for long-term prosperity:  This argument is The Population Ponzi Scheme: the idea that we need continuous inflow of new workers, consumers, and tax payers to keep the economy growing.  Like all Ponzi Schemes, this one eventually leads to disaster, because it obviously cannot go on forever.  It also confuses individual standard of living, vs. gross national product.  The former is what we seek.  Who cares if we double our &ldquo;national economy,�? if we must live packed like rats in stinking, stress-filled poverty-stricken city hell-holes.  People would prefer a 10% reduction in salary to live on a larger piece of land, surrounded by nature, serenity, and clean air and water, and safety.  Ever increasing immigration gets you Los Angles or Mexico City.  California, which has the highest USA immigration, is bankrupt, and is in a downward economic and social spiral.</p>
<p>3) Enhancing our role in the world:  Note that both England and the USA were dominant world and economic powers during periods when their population was homogeneous and they had virtually no Third World immigrants.  Now that both nations have increased their &ldquo;diversity,�? both are in decline.  China, which is 95% Han Chinese is in ascendancy. <br>

I have recently moved from one of those invasion suburbs that you mentioned to a greener, Whiter, more watery and spacious area.<br>
And I feel so much better for it and my stress levels have gone right down.<br>
Where I was in the outer north of Melbourne, we were literally getting drowned out by other cultures.<br>
Halal butchers and Mosques everywhere with a constant stream of more Africans, Turks, Iraqi&rsquo;s and various grabby southern Asians constantly showing up with their large families in tow. <br>
You&rsquo;d hear stories of a family of 20+ Indians buying a two bedroom house, working together with a insect like efficiency paying it off super quickly, then moving to the house next door to do the same thing while slowly taking over the whole street. <br>
Then there is a large (three stories high approx) and very alien looking Sheik temple on the Hume Highway which draws all of it&rsquo;s pilgrims to flood the area, on Sundays especially compelling my partner and I to play &ldquo;spot the White guy�? (our version of &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Waldo?�?).  <br>
When my daughter&rsquo;s local play centre had a multi cultural day, I dressed her as a traditional Ozzie (cork hat etc.), the &lsquo;multi&rsquo;-cultural experience that day entailed Muslim and African music from beginning to end,  with no exception. <br>
Every single kid at the local public high school had black hair too for instances (barring some hair dye here and there), so my kids literally would have visually &lsquo;stuck out like a sore thumb&rsquo; there and would have &lsquo;been honey to the bees.&rsquo;<br>
Most of our rates (land taxes) went to building immigrant learning centres, job seeking and training facilities for foreigners and ESOL schools, we also got a &lsquo;Mohamad&rsquo; (Mohamad Abbouche) voted in as mayor for our troubles.<br>
When my partner and I had to go to our local Hospital for treat in the AE, I am not exaggerating when I say that all of the five people ahead of us in the queue they all needed a completely different specific translator to talk to the charge nurse. <br>
And when my partner delivered our two babies, we were literally the only two English speakers on the ward and our two baby family was dwarfed by the other mother&rsquo;s already large broods.<br>
And then to top it off two major terrorist cells were (thankfully) thwarted in our area over the last five years. ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yhmvoaz" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yhmvoaz</a> MCG plot, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yhq953u" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/yhq953u</a> Somali Holsworthy army base plot)&hellip;�?these are the people in the neighborhood, in the neighborhood.�?<br>
And this is not to mention all the drug crime, and violence that comes with all of these conscious less invaders.<br>
We were economically stuck where we were too, as the constant immigration (400,000 a year, half being student visas) puts lots of pressure on the property market, raising the price of housing in the centre outwards with reports of real estate agents getting offered brides and death threats to house desperate people.<br>
All of this pushes people out further and further to the dry, waterless city fringes to live.<br>
Of that 400,000 figure 25% are from the UK alone, no doubt escaping the Orwellian horrors there, but the average age being 50yrs old effectively making us the old British empires &lsquo;elephant graveyard.&rsquo;<br>
And the only time I remember immigration as an recent election issue, was when John Howard was scare mongering on &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; immigration which is in a pittance, only in the thousands, compared to the nearly half million a year we get in &lsquo;legal&rsquo; migration.  <br>
Most Ozzies I know work hard and make good money (maybe $800 ish a week in the hand), but then drink lots, smoke lots of marijuana and take for granted their prosperity, probably because of the area I lived in.<br>
I&rsquo;m currently re training/upskilling myself because from having &lsquo;entry level&rsquo; corporate skills, I have been usurped by all of these Indians who seem to all have a Master&rsquo;s degree or PhD in something. I found this while working in I.T., telecommunications or energy services. And when I worked in banking (before they cost cut me away), I noticed that all of graduate employees in our inter company newsletter looked like that all (100%) come from Taiwan (Han Chinese).   <br>
We White Australians were constantly told that we have no culture to preserve and that any sign of ethno patriotism is considered &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; or an embarrassment by the liberal press.<br>
And on the nightly news we&rsquo;d constantly get these propaganda &lsquo;puff pieces&rsquo; selling us on the idea that we&rsquo;re a melting pot, country of immigrants while sharing some success story of some African hairdresser who after receiving lots of assistance now has a successful business catering to her own people.<br>
I now live among majority White people and although we are economically worse off, due to the smaller population we are so much happier.<br>
But although this will sound selfish, its now &lsquo;everyman (& woman) for them selves&rsquo; to me now, I feel like I&rsquo;ve lived in the future and it&rsquo;s not good.<br>
And unfortunately I think we have to meet these invaders by emulating their tactics.  <br>
I&rsquo;d prefer a stronger stance of course, but hey we have to be practical too and think of our children&rsquo;s future, because really that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.<br>
I am bringing my kids up to proudly celebrate their heritages.<br>
But as bad as I make our situation sound, I appreciate that we have it really easy compared to Whites in South Africa, the U.K. and the urban parts of the States.<br>
When ever I get the choice to choose, I choose White. <br>
But I don&rsquo;t get <i>given</i> that choice very often.</p>

		<p>@ Poster 12 Loud European  - you are right about European Aussies not taking things seriously enough. There is often some truth to stereotypes and unfortunately the laid-back Aussie stereotype is no exception. The education system needs an overhaul and students need to be encouraged and nurtured from a younger age to take up the more highly-skilled fields of study rather than not being encouraged to do anything more than what they feel like by a system that doesn&rsquo;t really care either way because it can import all the labour it wants. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Australia can&rsquo;t afford the luxury of casual immigration laws. It sits too close to Asia.</p>
<p>Other than pretty substantial populations living along the sea coast, as it is now, and then only some of the sea coast, the interior of Aussie land is just not fit for any sort of large inhabitation at all.</p>
<p>Habitation yes, but not substantial. 35 million by 2050 does seem a lot. It can be done if resources are abundant, but Australia has some pretty harsh extremes.</p>
