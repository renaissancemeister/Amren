<h1>3 Arrested As NC School Board Reverses Busing Plan</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Baker, Google News, March 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The school board in North Carolina&rsquo;s capital city narrowly agreed Tuesday to roll back a policy that buses students to achieve diversity, following a tense meeting at which three people were arrested, others were forcibly removed and heated arguments echoed passions from an era past.</p>
<p>After dozens spoke at a hearing, the Wake County school board voted 5-4 to approve a new assignment policy aimed at placing students in schools near their homes.</p>
<p>The talk was angry, as terms like &#8220;segregation&#8221; peppered many arguments. A crowd of students sitting outside the doors of the meeting chanted so loudly that they briefly disrupted the hearing. Extra police officers were on hand to provide security.</p>
<p>Raleigh police said three men were charged with trespassing or resisting officers. One was released and two others remained jailed Tuesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reversing the diversity rules follows a cascade of similar shifts around the South, and particularly in North Carolina, which once was a model of desegregation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NAACP supported the long-standing policy that uses socio-economic background rather than race to assign students, and Barber continued to question the board&rsquo;s plans during Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bill Randall, a black congressional candidate, said the diversity program is not the root of problems among low-achieving students.</p>

		<p>Deseg programs cost money, therefore someone makes money off of it, and other associated costs.  The odds of this happening are very long, but the cops in Raleigh should do some checking up   &mdash;   the screamers yelling &#8220;segregation&#8221; very likely have some clear financial or other links to those who directly benefit from deseg spending.

		<p>You mean there is still some &#8220;busing&#8221; going on in this country? I thought that was phased out years ago.</p>
<p>This article focuses a lot on the protesters, but I&rsquo;ll bet there are a lot of parents who are hopping mad that, in many cases, their kids have been bused to a school 45 minutes to an hour away when a good school may be just down the street.</p>

<p>My, my, my, how greatly the black masses want to be included everywhere whites are, so they can then complain about not being treated equally, because they&rsquo;re not intelligent enough to compete.</p>
<p>Integration and busing have caused a dumbing down of the curriculum to black levels and a cause for much chaos and trouble-making by blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good the failure of busing is finally being recognized for what it really is; however, it&rsquo;s far too late to bring the country back from the insane policies that began years ago, many of which are still in force right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re beyond the point of no return.  Only secession will offer the hope of forming a successful country within the US right now, and it will have to be along lines of race and politics to be successful itself.</p>

		<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t calling for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in black neighborhoods and schools. Never have, never will. Black businesses won&rsquo;t invite &#8216;diversity&rsquo; either. Virtually entire cities now are black. There won&rsquo;t be a program for diversity there. Well, that&rsquo;s not true. There are diversity programs there, too, by which they mean hiring even more blacks and exalting, celebrating, and promote them.</p>

		<p>Wake county has not bussed to achieve racial balance in years.   They have and for the rest of this school year bussed to achieve a median family income balance.  So whether they continue or not does not necessarily segregate or desegregate the schools. What it will do is save transportation cost and allow for increased parental involvement.</p>
<p>The three arrested were white college students with addresses outside Wake County or for that matter NC.</p>

<p>Yes, they were mostly White. One young idiot they interviewed said that he was in high school, so they weren&rsquo;t all college students. Gee, did the kid&rsquo;s parents drive him there? There was also some White idiot wearing a T-shirt that said &#8220;We won&rsquo;t stay quiet&#8221; in Spanish.(No nos quedaremos callados.) A very sad spectacle, indeed. </p>

<p>Bill Randall has more sense than the white agitators.  There is not the slightest bit of evidence that putting an underachieving black student next to a white student in a classroom will improve the academic performance of the black student.  Whatever the solution to underachieving blacks is, it&rsquo;s going to have to come from people like Randall, because those underachieving blacks sure as hell aren&rsquo;t going to listen to white people.<br>

		<p>Do they think that by being around whites that some kind of intellectual pixie dust will rub off onto them? After all these years, I really don&rsquo;t understand the whole paradoxical idea, to be perfectly honest.<br>
It seems like calls for diversity are an admission by those of the noble darker hue that they need to avoid their own kind and get the magic pixie dust from whitie. <br>
Self-hating?<br>
Oh yeah, its called &#8220;internalized racism&#8221;. <br>
Sigh. Well, at least the &#8220;black congressional candidate&#8221; gets it. Diversity ain&rsquo;t the problem. Its those of the noble darker hue.</p>

<p>You know, I always thought that there would be separation because so many white women are bedding down with black and other men, or even simply because secretly, all white men want separation. Or even because eventually white women will vote that way too, as the reality of extinction looms more and more obvious. But you could be right, it could be the only way to build a sane society. We can&rsquo;t count on the rest of the world to prop us up with endless consumer goods for Another 40 plus years for nothing in return. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Bill Randall, a black congressional candidate, said the diversity program is not the root of problems among low-achieving students&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>He is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>The &#8216;root of problems&rsquo; among low-achieving black students is an inability to succeed past their own inherent capabilities  &mdash;  for blacks, with average IQs of 85 and brains five cubic inches smaller than those of Whites, academic parity with Whites will never be possible.</p>
<p>And yes, we want our White children segregated from blacks  &mdash;  and who can blame us?  Blacks target our White children in school and on the bus for robbery, assault, beatings, rapes and worse.  Black children are disruptive in class, impulsive, and aggressive, yet scream &#8216;racism&rsquo; whenever they don&rsquo;t get their way. </p>
<p>Blacks continue to believe that high black suspension and expulsion rates are due to a &#8216;Racist White System&rsquo; and not black children&rsquo;s aberrant behavior and inability to abide by school standards  &mdash;  standards such as not running around the classroom, not cursing at the teacher, waiting one&rsquo;s turn, not cutting in line, not fighting or stealing, not blaming others for one&rsquo;s misbehavior, not damaging or destroying school property or the property of others, and not physically assaulting those around you.</p>
<p>Why would any White parent send his precious child into a school or onto a bus to be assaulted and beaten up by feral, fatherless blacks?</p>
<p>The number one job of parents is to protect and provide a safe environment for their children.  I&rsquo;d rather be called a Nazi racist than put my beautiful daughter in jeopardy of being raped, beaten up or robbed by blacks.</p>
<p>George Wallace was right.  Segregation is the answer, the only answer.</p>

		<p>The only way that positioning black students next to whites will improve blacks&rsquo; scores is if the blacks are copying the whites&rsquo; work. Even then, I&rsquo;m sure much of it would be copied wrong and much left out. </p>
<p>I find it very interesting that within a period of two weeks this decison came down, along with one that actually did make NBC Nightly News stating that for the last 40 years reading skills in US schools have dropped over 18%, to 5th in the world. Oddly enough, the timeline of both of these problematic (not to mention horrendously expensive) issues began with integration. Imagine that.</p>

		<p>To posters 6 and 15, I also wonder about these things.  </p>
<p>#1  Why don&rsquo;t white liberals show us the way and integrate themselves in black neighborhoods?  The only whites I ever see doing that are the random &#8220;down with the people&#8221; college student who moves on at some point.  You rarely ever see any white families moving into places to integrate with the &#8216;peeps.&rsquo;  Even further, we need to ensure that all white lib areas get bombarded with &#8216;affordable housing.&rsquo;  The Kennedy Compound needs a housing project next door.  I challenge every Amren reader to push this!  Let&rsquo;s bring the joys of diversity to the lib&rsquo;s back yards.  </p>
<p>#2  Why is it that there can be no all-white neighborhoods, but all-black, Latino or Asian neighborhoods are celebrated for their &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; and culture?</p>
<p>  We need to call libs out on these and many other issues.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have to understand that the &#8220;white American&#8221; identity is finished.  To promote anything of our culture we are going to have to reach back in our family trees to the countries of our ancestors and have lots and lots of &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; festivals such as Irish holidays, Swedish celebrations, Oktoberfest, Bastille Day, Renaissance festivals especially, etc&hellip;  Then the libs and non-whites cannot say anything.  </p>
<p>I went to a Renaissance festival last summer and for the first time in 15 years I truly felt I was among my people.  There were thousands of whites as far as the eye could see, celebrating all European cultures including jousting and other manly sports.  It was great.</p>

<p>About 10 or so years ago I met a former teacher at a suburban school that quit her job because the principal and other administrators called her in to a meeting and told her she needed to learn the difference between bad behavior and black behavior.  The reason for the meeting was because she was referring a disproportionate number of black children to the principal for discipline.</p>

		<p>On the one hand, they want integration so bad they&rsquo;re willing to create bizarre bussing schemes and the like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, notions like &#8220;color blindness,&#8221; &#8220;assimilation,&#8221; &#8220;melting pot&#8221; etc are officially dead. Every identity group is exhorted to maintain their identity at all costs. (Except whites of course.) Diversity and multiculturalism, and in the end, balkanism is the ideal that the elites are forcing us towards.</p>
<p>So it seems like they&rsquo;d WANT to be rid of bussing and all that. If they want to keep their racial-cultural identity intact, then why the fuss over insisting on going to school with whites, or for learning in the Western, white middle class style for that matter?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a matter of going to schools that are as good materially - then hey, give their schools the same money (they get more in many cases already - look at Kansas City for example) and lets call it a day. But it&rsquo;s not only about that. It&rsquo;s about wanting whatever whites have (culturally as well as materially), even though the reality is that they hate white culture. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd. The competing goals of integration and diversity in the end are a contradictory sick joke that we&rsquo;re going to be fighting over and trying to sort out forever as long as we go down this path towards minority-majority demography. </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so much easier and more comfortable to be around those like yourself?</p>

		<p>The very word &#8220;busing&#8221; and its dismal history in this country since the 1970s has yielded nothing but chaos in the school systems of the country; massive white flight to the suburbs making many cities like what Detroit is now; and a general lowering of the quality of public education everywhere in the US. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your dream come true:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yhg7c7v" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yhg7c7v</a></p>
<p>16 Shawn the Female:</p>
<p>Interesting you talk about black students copying off white students.  I ambushed some black kid who was doing just that to me.  This was in 7th grade science class, in a school purportedly for &#8220;gifted&#8221; students, but most of the blacks were slightly above the white average at best.  Somehow, the one in question was able to get into this school, but didn&rsquo;t deserve to be there.  He was the typical arrogant type, whose favorite pastime was bragging about his male organ.  </p>
<p>For a period of a month, comprising two major tests and a few quizzes, he was cheating off me, because he sat not directly aside me, but close enough such that there was nobody else between the two of us, and he could easily see me doing my tests and quizzes.  I knew he was cheating off me, for two reasons:  (1) I saw it out of the corner of my eye, and (2) He got the exact same score I did on all those tests and quizzes.  </p>
<p>After the second test, and the usual identical score between the two of us, I finally got frustrated enough to do something.  But I just didn&rsquo;t know what.  I wanted to tell the teacher directly, but I was sorta in her doghouse over something unrelated.  Then I got to thinking that my mother always told me never to cheat off anyone else, because the person you&rsquo;re cheating off of might be dumber than you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dumber than you.&#8221;  Hmmmm&hellip;.</p>
<p>For one test, I decided to be dumber than him.</p>
<p>However, this also required me talking to the teacher, and working up the courage to do so in spite of me being in her doghouse.  I did, and as it turns out, she had already gotten over the incident.  And she approved of my ambush, finding it suspicious herself that his test scores had been uncharacteristically high over the last two tests and quizzes in between.  </p>
<p>So, the next test comes along, and I tank every question, and he poodles right along.  I went back up to the science room at lunch on the day of the test to do it for real, and to see that the teacher tore up my ambushed test.  We got them back with scores at the next class.  I got 89%, he got 3%.  (Turns out that one of my deliberately wrong answers was actually right.)  From the look on his face, I could see that he knew what I just did to him.  He changed his seat in science class after that, and never as much as looked at me the rest of the school year.  </p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t in that school for 8th grade, so I have no idea what became of him.   I can only imagine now that I&rsquo;m helping to pay for his room and board.  <br>

		<p>At least, it&rsquo;s good to see that bussing is finally being abolished in some places. I remember living in the Maryland suburbs in the 1980s and being bussed an hour away to schools which were filled with rowdiness, and where little academic work was done because the time was mostly devoted to politically correct indoctrination. Another argument for getting rid of bussing is the expense. As gas keeps getting more expensive, how much must it be costing to send those large school busses such long distances every day? </p>
