<h1>Prosecutor Investigating NJ Walmart Racial Comment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! Finance, March 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A racial comment made over the public-address system at a Walmart store in southern New Jersey is being investigated as a possible bias crime, a prosecutor&rsquo;s office said Thursday.</p>
<p>A male voice came over the system Sunday evening and calmly announced: &#8220;Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement, at the Washington Township store, provoked an immediate apology from the store manager and a promise from company officials to try to determine how it happened.</p>
<p>Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean F. Dalton began an investigation Monday {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Office spokesman Bernie Weisenfeld said in the statement that its victim-witness unit has contacted the store&rsquo;s management, offering counseling services to anyone affected by the announcement. The county&rsquo;s Human Relations Commission was offering similar help.</p>
<p>Officials say several people have come forward and expressed interest in getting counseling.</p>

		<p>All we keep hearing about this voice is that it was a &#8220;male.&#8221;  Why haven&rsquo;t they said &#8220;white male?&#8221;  My guess is because it wasn&rsquo;t a white man, it was likely a black man or Hispanic man.  If black, I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s all an angle for a racial hoax.</p>

<p>Yes, if any black thugs who might have been put off from mugging someone that evening, but were in such angst and mental anguish over the horrible assault, they can rest assured they will be placed on a stretcher, taken to a intensive care facility and given chicken soup and tranquilzers until they recover sufficiently to make their next court date for one of the 58% of total violent crimes they commit every year.</p>

		<p>In a sane world this whole incident would be considered comical and forgotten about by now. To put it another way had the &#8220;voice&#8221; asked white people to leave the building do you think a federal case (you wait and see) would be made of it? Liberals, Marxists and assorted PC types have little or no sense of humor. They know diversity, civil rights and multiculturalism are scams but are committed to them nevertheless. They are fanatics and such are very serious, humorless people; unfortunately very dangerous people as well.</p>

		<p>I was disgusted  &mdash;  but not exactly surprised  &mdash;  this morning as I listened to wanna-be &#8220;rogue&#8221; or &#8220;iconoclast&#8221; talk show host Michael Smerconish tell the world that this not-worthy-of-national-coverage &#8220;story&#8221; was either &#8220;terrible&#8221; or &#8220;horrible&#8221;, in his own words  &mdash;  I forget which.</p>
<p>I wanted to e-mail him about his lame moral posturing as soon as I got home from work, but his badly programmed web site doesn&rsquo;t provide his address. It did, however, name several books he has authored, which I&rsquo;ll happily avoid in the future.</p>
<p>And I still intend to let him know what I think of his egregious blather.</p>

		<p>This is the biggest non-news, media-hyped, pointless non-story so far this year. You&rsquo;d think someone pumped poison gas through the speaker system the way it is portrayed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fully figure out the angle here but is truly absurd that the national media jumped on it. I&rsquo;m white - if I was in Walmart and someone came over the PA system and said &#8220;All whites leave the store&#8221; I&rsquo;d probably roll my eyes, think the obvious prank was pretty stupid, and move on. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d need counseling or demand prosecutors search for the criminal to ease my pain and suffering. My wife is Lutheran and I am Jewish and the same holds true with the religious aspect.  </p>
<p>Basically, this story not only makes blacks look even more pitiful and moronic than they already are but also feeds the white guilt of idiot liberals and leftists. The black over-reaction is clearly ridiculous however what is worse is that it is so predictable. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if they have been conditioned to immediately take on the public posture of &#8220;once again&#8221; being the victim of some unseen white conspiracy while at the same time acting as if they have some magical protected status where it is a capital crime to upset their fragile emotional balance. And naturally, the smell of money - extorted from Walmart - is like blood in the water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, guilt-ridden whites - also without thinking - instantly chalk this up as further proof that they must hate themselves and their evil heritage. </p>
<p>Blacks have already dumbed down the schools and the workplace - now they are dumbing down the emotional age of society. Seriously, grow up. Have some perspective on what happened. With blacks there is no nuance or logical understanding of place or events. They behave like foolish children but cannot even see it.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say the mystery voice on the PA system is found and happens to be black - will that change anything? No - blacks are too thick to see the irony and will just keep on keepin&rsquo; it real until they stumble into the next excuse for their own failures. </p>
<p>And the guilt-ridden whites? They will &#8220;know&#8221; that the perpetrator behind the microphone was driven to do the evil deed because of all those past injustices.</p>
<p>Attention Walmart shoppers - America has become unhinged. </p>

		<p>Somebody makes a bad-taste joke over a Walmart intercom and right away a prosecutor is assigned to the &#8220;case&#8221;.  However, a group of very serious people making death threats to hotel employees if their employer honors its contract with peaceful white people gets no attention whatsoever - let alone a prosecutor.  This is the messed up world we live in!</p>

		<p>The shopping experience would be so much better if most blacks left all of the stores and never set foot in them again. It feels like I am walking into a war zone every time I walk into a store that has numerous black shoppers or black employees. Their rudeness insults my sensibilities.  At least they still get out of my way when I walk toward them. </p>

Were their &#8220;beliefs&#8221; plausible, they could defend them, but they are down to nothing but lies by now.  To criticize their &#8220;beliefs&#8221; by reason allows for the possibility that there may be some sense in what they say, but to sneer and laugh at them denies them any dignity at all. </p>

<p><b><i> &#8220;[Spokesman of the Gloucester County Prosecutor&rsquo;s office] Bernie Weisenfeld said that its victim-witness unit is offering counseling services to anyone affected by the announcement.&#8221;  </i></b><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>My first reaction to this non-story, this little prank,  was to burst into laughter.  Incredible!</p>
<p>Ah, but it&rsquo;s turning out to be not such a harmless, innocent prank after all. As  some posters have shrewdly observed above, it&rsquo;s turning into a chance at the ghetto lottery. Get ready for the law suits!  I&rsquo;m sure some of those customers have been traumatized for life, poor things&hellip; they&rsquo;ll never get over this horror.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s good to know that law enforcement is on the job.  I&rsquo;m sure they will investigate thoroughly and prosecute to the fullest.  (And, by the way, on that subject, what is being done about the death threats and the cancellations of contracts with four hotels  that 300 Amreners were subjected to in Virginia last month?  Any progress there?)</p>

		<p>Counseling for those traumatized for this vicious &#8220;hate crime&#8221;?</p>
<p>Doubtless this dreadful announcement brought forth terrible memories in the minds of all the black listeners, reminders of those grim days during which every tree and lamppost in the South was festooned with blacks from the daily lynchings.  Every day was a day to Kill a Mockingbird in America!</p>
<p>The store should open its doors for a weekend of free shopping for all black patrons by way of atonement.  They should be encouraged to bring rocks and bricks to throw through the windows in celebration of the time-honored tradition of black rioting and looting.  It&rsquo;s only through gestures such as these that we can truly come together as a people.</p>

		<p>Most Wal-marts are more secure than most prisons, the omni present security cameras generally outnumber customers. They probably have the black prankster on tape from half a dozen different angles. If they crack down they look like racists since the prankster can always just claim he pulled the stunt to &#8220;highlight the racism of the wal-mart corporation&#8221; or something.</p>

		<p>It was likely a black guy.</p>
<p>I say that because it appears to be nothing more than a prank, and a black person would likely be more comfortable committing such a prank, if nothing else because the punishment will be much less if it is found to be a black guy.</p>
<p>I wonder if they can do a voice analysis, although it would never be conclusive.  Sometimes you can tell a person&rsquo;s race and approximate age by the voice, but admittedly it is not conclusive.  Anyway tell the shoppers to stop being so melodramatic about it.  It was just a joke.</p>

		<p>This was done very clumsily which leads me to belive that it was most likely a black-perpetuated hoax. If it was done by a white person, it will turn out to have been a teenager, most likely just being a witless teenager, trying to see what would happen. A &#8220;real racist&#8221; (read a white adult, because we all know only whites are racists) would have achieved this with far more finesse.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting the one poster has it right.  Another race hoax.  The PA mic is unattended.  This smells a little like the hanging the noose on the door knob of the black professor incident.  That was, of course, discovered to have been done BY the black professor.<br>
Even if this incident was NOT done by a black looking to win another ghetto lottery, it was probably done by somebody who was sick and tired of blacks blocking aisles while they loudly and profanely yakking about whatever they yak about, all the while stuffing items into bags, under shirts, down pants, etc.  Or, opening packages and snacking, then putting the package back on the shelf.  Another famous black and hispanic pass time while in stores.</p>

<p>BTW is this not the same but opposite of black pride movements advertising to blacks to buy at black owned stores only?  Meaning don&rsquo;t buy at non-black stores?  That is an announcement to leave the non-black stores.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s been an arrest, but no details as of this writing about who or what the charges are.  When they do charge him, I worry that the underlying crime will be one that is never prosecuted, except that a &#8220;hate&#8221; enhancement could be added.  It&rsquo;s not beyond possibility that old, stupid laws that have never been enforced in 100 years will start to make a comeback so that unpopular speech can have an underlying crime attached.</p>

<p>As far as I know, no crime(if it was a public PA system - if a customer misused a private PA terminal I&rsquo;m sure they could charge him with something minor like unauthorized using of company materials which would at most end up being a tiny fine) was commited.</p>

Were they offering him counseling for what he endured? And was the D.A. outraged?? Whose side was the NAACP on then.

		<p>It was a 16-year old teenage boy.  They say here that they&rsquo;re not going to identify his racial persuasion, because it &#8220;did not factor into the investigation.&#8221;  That probably means he is not white, and probably black.  It also says that the juvenile criminal proceedings against him will take place in the county where he lives, Atlantic NJ, instead of Gloucester NJ, where the Wal-Mart in question sits.  I looked up the demographics of both, and Atlantic is about twice as black as Gloucester. (In terms of percentage)</p>

		<p>The perp, a 16 year old boy, has been arrested.  Because he is a juvenile his name is not being released.  I now quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen&rsquo;s age, and would not disclose the teen&rsquo;s race, saying that did not factor into the investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>His race is not being released.  What does that tell you?  He isn&rsquo;t white!  And as anyone from South Jersey can tell you Atlantic County, especially Blacklantic City, has a large number of black residents.  Will this &#8220;boy&#8221; get the juvenile book thrown at him?  Will he be crucified like a white teen would be?  Will his life be ruined like a white teens would be?  NOPE!  </p>
<p>Actually I hope the kid is Hispanic, that would be a real hoot.</p>
<p>As for poster #31: that elderly white man who got slugged by an oppressed black male was probably a racist when he was younger and is only now getting his just deserts.  I am sure that is how the MSM would put it.</p>
<p>Like water, this country just runs down hill faster and faster with no dam in sight!</p>

If we&rsquo;re thinking of the same case, that was in California, and quite recently. He was beaten by a couple of blacks, so severely that he was not expected to live.  I have seen nothing further about it, and don&rsquo;t know if he survived. Not surprisingly!  <br>

		<p>In New York City many years ago, in a clothing store, all blacks were ordered to leave, and all of the whites, about 8, were ordered, at gunpoint, to stay inside, so a black racist mass killer could set the place on fire.  All of the whites who were ordered to stay died.  So did the black racist who set the fire.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;A racial comment made over the public-address system at a Walmart store in southern New Jersey is being investigated as a possible bias crime, a prosecutor&rsquo;s office said Thursday&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>O, The Horror!  The Horror!</p>
<p>This has been headline news here for several days even though I am on the opposite side of the country.  </p>
<p>Yet Whites being tortured and slaughtered by blacks as in the Knoxville Horror (two young Whites raped and murdered by blacks), The Wichita Massacre (four young Whites shot in the back of the head by blacks as they knelt in a snowy soccer field), the Pearcy Massacre (five Whites shot-gunned and their bodies burned by three blacks)  &mdash;  and hardly a peep out of the msm.</p>
<p>I would not have even read, heard about or known of these cases if not for the Internet  &mdash;  and sites such as VDare.com and AmRen.</p>
<p>Yet a prank where black feelings might have been hurt merits coast-to-coast front page coverage for days on end, calls for prosecution of Hate Crimes and a host of counselors in case an aggrieved black possibly had his feelings hurt.</p>
<p>The media consider black feelings to be more important than White lives.</p>
<p>Anon #31 and #35:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Does anyone here remember when that old white guy working at a Wal-Mart as a door greeter was punched in the face by some black thug? Where was the compassion for this white guy?</p>
<p> &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; <br>
If we&rsquo;re thinking of the same case, that was in California, and quite recently&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about a case in California, but the one #31 refers to took place in Florida:</p>
<p>&#8216;&hellip;Ed Bauman, 69, was working as a greeter at the Walmart in Palm Bay, Florida when the security alarm went off as 23-year-old Skyler Lowery was leaving the store.</p>
<p>Bauman followed him to the parking lot to take his license plate number, which pissed off the younger man, so he took the greeter&rsquo;s clipboard. Bauman tried to get it back. That&rsquo;s when Lowery took a swing at him. Bauman, quite naturally, swung back in self-defense before another customer subdued the perp.</p>
<p>Lowery claims Bauman used a racial slur against him.</p>
<p> Walmart,  fired him for fighting with a customer&hellip; Police say he was well within his rights to defend himself&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt there are no Civil Rights or redress for Whites?</p>

		<p>35 Anon: You can&rsquo;t keep track of the anti-White atrocities without a scorecard these days.  The Wal mart greeter beating was moths ago.  The California beating took place the same day as this prank, last week sometime, and happened at a convenience store.  I only read about this stuff on AmRen, the msm has more interest in jesting words than evil deeds.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about a case in California, but the one #31 refers to took place in Florida:<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The California case happened in San Bernardino, near Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I find Bon&rsquo;s  unawareness of this case rather &#8220;amusing&#8221; (if that&rsquo;s quite the right word, and no offense) and also very significant&hellip;. because, as she said above, the papers out there have inflated the  New Jersey non-story into &#8220;headline news for several days&#8221;, while a truly vicious (perhaps lethal) black on white crime that happened very near to her remains unheralded and hardly known even to people nearby.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yjnetd8" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yjnetd8</a></p>
<p>Oh, I see now, on checking further, that the victim (in his 60s) has expired. The police are presently looking for &#8220;two young men&#8221;&hellip; no further details.  I&rsquo;m sure there are lots of &#8220;young men&#8221; in California, so they&rsquo;ll have plenty of looking to do with such a vague description!</p>
<p>[Incidentally   &mdash;   if you have a strong stomach   &mdash;   some of those other unheralded stories are quite amazing too &hellip; such as &#8220;Police trying to identify woman&rsquo;s severed head found inside a backpack.&#8221;  Incredible! This is what is going on all around us.]</p>

		<p>At the most this young man&rsquo;s offense is merely disorderly conduct.As it is, I don&rsquo;t know what a &#8220;bias&rsquo; offense is. A lawyer friend of mine and member of the NJ bar, informs me that since the lad is only 16, he can only be ajudicated delinquent in a Juvenile court. That the county prosecutor was called in is total overkill. It is most likely that he simply want to get his face in the press.</p>

<p>Daily whites&rsquo; are asked to endure stupidity from media about whiteness being inferior to blackness.  Do whites need therapy?</p>
<p>Watch BET for two hours and you&rsquo;ll be more thankful than ever you are white, you will plainly see differences in culture and intelligence.</p>
<p>Our government should have all of us in therapy for selling horrendous lies for the past 60 years concerning these issues.<br>
Someday the call will come, &#8220;will all whites leave the building.&#8221;  Where will you go for therapy then?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just barely old enough to remember when American towns had drive-ins, which were social hubs for young people.  I was only six or seven, but our family&rsquo;s teens, and their friends, would call the drive-ins, and get the employees to page fictitious people whose names were subtly obscene (too subtly for the drive-in employees to grasp).</p>
<p>One of my cousins did a perfect imitation of the elderly Jewish grande dame who headed the local Republican Women.  That &#8216;Gertie&rsquo; voice could command (obscene) emergency pages of the most ridiculous-sounding fictional grandchildren.  Our slumber parties were the best.  We could not stop laughing, because it usually worked.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering: did any of those drive-in customers have to have counseling, after hearing those obscenities over the loudspeakers?  Did my cousins traumatize a whole generation?  Oooooooh, the HUMANITY!</p>
