<h1>Black Leaders&rsquo; Support May Buy Time for Paterson</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Goldman and Michael Gormley, Yahoo News, March 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York Gov. David Paterson might have won some time when he received what has become rare support from influential black leaders as he tries to ride out allegations in two scandals that threaten his job and led to the resignation of three top staffers.</p>
<p>{snip} Late Thursday night, black leaders in New York City said he deserves his right to due process and should stay in office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Group members led by the Rev. Al Sharpton said they want to meet with the governor to discuss his ability to continue to govern.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn said in an interview afterward that there was overwhelming support for the idea that Paterson is entitled to the presumption of innocence until the investigation is finished.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Outside the restaurant, Sharpton was asked explicitly if he supported the governor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Former Mayor David Dinkins said Paterson absolutely should remain in office. Former state Comptroller H. Carl McCall made a case for Paterson to stay, while others reportedly were angry inside the closed meeting, with some calling for Paterson to resign.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Quinnipiac University poll released Friday showed plummeting support for Paterson among New Yorkers. The poll found that 46 percent of New Yorkers say he should finish out his term, while a survery released earlier in the week had that number at 61 percent.</p>

		<p>Today Amy Goodman on Democracy Now reported with a straight face that black leaders had met twice at Sylvia&rsquo;s in Harlem supported Patterson. She had nothing to say about what white leaders think nor did she posit that the white leaders should have an opinion.</p>
<p>Children are surrounded by the message that black leaders come together and support corrupt black politicians.  Black children are emboldened by it, but Whites just absorb it a necessary part of overcoming our shameful history.  But a few smart whites who still know how to think in their own interest see black behavior as pure race privilege. Whites will eventually learn how to negotiate from position of racial survival instead of racial shame.</p>
<p><br>
On TV was also Eharmony advertisement showing a fully afro looking africanae snuggling and loving with a White man. Absolutely disgusting!  I can&rsquo;t watch TV without my home being invaded with one insult after the next.  Blacks rule TV.</p>
<p>Then was a kids show with schoolchildren walking arm in arm, and they of course had a diversity nestled in against a beautiful white girl.</p>
<p>The very Ebonics Mo&rsquo;Nique was interviewing afro Paul Mooney about his book Black is the New White. He was saying how much he loves Obama and his chocolate brown wife with the fine behind. The afros in the audience gave that a standing ovation. Thankfully, no Whites were visible in the audience.</p>
<p>Then on a soap opera was a beautiful white girl sitting at a table with an afrothugh pouring out her heart about something. He was listening so earnestly, but we know that he was really planning how to give her womb the curse of afro destruction and ruin her for her own kind forever.   Diversity = Mongrelization.</p>
<p>The a Clorox commercial came asking about a pair of white socks &#8220;Which is Whiter?&#8221; Finally, I didn&rsquo;t change the channel, and wondered if anyone but me is seeing what I see?</p>
<p>Then in a restaurant I saw an absolutely ugly monster afro hitting on a blonde White women. I was disgusted and disturbed, but could do nothing because the government here is all black and I&rsquo;d be arrested for a hate crime if I tried to protect a White woman from afrodestruction.  Then I blamed her, because she was in a restaurant that serves blacks, and any good White woman knows to stay out of places like that.</p>

		<p>First, who cares what black &#8220;leaders&#8221; think? When did they become the arbiters of NY government? Seriously, Paterson meeting with black blowhards at a time like this is a massive waste of time - he couldn&rsquo;t find a less objective, less intelligent group to help him deal with his problems. </p>
<p>Sadly, the situation is a mess. Paterson is entirely incompetent and ill-equipped for the job and he should resign just based on his inability to govern, scandal or no scandal(s). Ultimately, his own stupidity led to the present fiasco which goes to show that dimwits should not be the governor of a major state.</p>
<p>The worst part, especially for New Yorkers, is that this will drag on some more as we hear the cries the racism to cover up the malfeasance.  </p>

		<p>The article refers to &#8220;rare black support&#8221;.  Puh-leeeeeease!  Blacks always support their own, and everybody knows it!<br>
As for all the black-oriented stuff on TV: a lot of blacks watch a lot of non-cable TV.  And, as for all the pro-black propaganda, almost everyone either knows the truth or learns it soon enough.  The problem is, too many young white women learn it the hard way.</p>

		<p>First, who cares what black &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; think?</p>
<p></p>
<p>I do.  I absolutely love seeing this.  Specifically, I absolutely love other white people seeing this.  They NEED to see this.  They need to know the extent to which blacks are corrupt and racist, especially the degree to which they are anti-white.</p>
<p>There is alot of racism in the US.  But it&rsquo;s not among whites.  It&rsquo;s blacks.  When whites see blacks doing this stuff, they wake the heck up.  First there is denial.  Then anger.  Then acceptance and integration of the truth into behavior.</p>
<p>The entire nation of white people is currently on the cusp from denial to anger.  You have not seen anything yet with regard to this.  There is going to be some real rage as the truth of people like Paterson and how blacks rally around him BECAUSE he does this stuff, not just despite it.  Whites will figure out that they have slipped into second class citizen status.  That is a very dangerous situation&hellip;.because there is no real threat of punishment for those who refuse to take this other than the agreement of other whites.  Once that disappears, there will be trouble.</p>
<p>I think the next year to three will be the anger stage.  This stuff will still be common, but it will enrage whites every time it happens.  There could be rioting.  Certainly, there will be incidents all over the place (think Joe Horn and what happened after Joe Horn).  After a time, no one will have any illusions as to what the deal is with blacks.  Society wil adjust to that new reality. Expect few to none blacks elected.  If anyone comments on it, they will be laughed at and chided about the Obama years&hellip;&hellip;if they are lucky.</p>
