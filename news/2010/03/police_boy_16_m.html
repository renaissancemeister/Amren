<h1>Police: Boy, 16, Made Racial Comment at NJ Walmart</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NPR, March 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 16-year-old boy who police said made an announcement at Walmart ordering all black people in a southern New Jersey store to leave was charged with harassment and bias intimidation, authorities said Saturday.</p>
<p>The boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, grabbed one of the courtesy phones at Walmart&rsquo;s Washington Township store Sunday evening and calmly announced: &#8220;Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now,&#8221; police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This was an extremely disturbing event on many levels,&#8221; Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference. &#8220;Any statements like these that can cause harm or grave concern must be addressed as quickly we possibly can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen&rsquo;s age, and would not disclose the teen&rsquo;s race, saying that did not factor into the investigation.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old has been charged with harassment and bias intimidation.</p>
<p>Authorities would not say whether the announcement was planned or made impulsively. Police said they were also investigating a teenage boy who accompanied the suspect to the store, but the other boy has not been charged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Winters [Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the NAACP] said she hopes the boy will get counseling and be educated about sensitivity so he can understand the consequences of his actions.</p>

		<p>I must assume that since the news release didn&rsquo;t identify the prankster as white that he was most likely black himself.  If so he&rsquo;s to be congratulated for his sense of humor.</p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;This was an extremely disturbing event on many levels,&rdquo; Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference. </em></p>
<p>What is &#8220;extremely disturbing&#8221; is that the legal establishment of New Jersey is bringing to bear it&rsquo;s full might against a harmless prank perpetrated by a 16-year-old boy. Give your head a shake, Dalton!</p>
<p><em>Winters [Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the NAACP] said she hopes the boy will get counseling and be educated about sensitivity so he can understand the consequences of his actions.</em></p>
<p>I hope the boy is allowed to continue to be a 16-year-old boy. It is entirely appropriate for 16-year-old boys to be committing pranks. The boy would need counselling if he wasn&rsquo;t committing pranks and goofing around. No one was physically hurt, no property was damaged, and there was no psychological damage involved. I should teach this boy a few of the pranks I pulled when I was 16, then you&rsquo;d have a news story. </p>

		<p>New Jersey supposedly has a new Governor that is supposedly frugal with taxpayer money. With one stroke of a pen, he can save the state the dear cost of prosecuting and imprisoning a teenage boy for a mindless prank. But he won&rsquo;t, because Chris Christie&rsquo;s record on race is horrible   &mdash;   he was a key Federal cog in the Turnergate scandal. </p>

		<p>Just when it looks as if the multicults can&rsquo;t fall any lower, they come up with another drop to an even lower level.</p>
<p>This political hack that&rsquo;s supposed to be a prosecutor definitely needs to go.  I wonder how many of the 37,500 white women raped by blacks last year were in his district yet not given even a fraction of the time devoted to this silliness.</p>
<p>I saw in a news story that the area involved is nearly bankrupt, yet they still have money to pursue frivolous incidents.  </p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see what a more severe economic drop will cause them to do.  Maybe lay off everyone in the prosecutor&rsquo;s office, but the DA himself?</p>
<p>That would be more than welcome.</p>

		<p>This was a headline story in our Southern Hemisphere news outlets too.<br>
Along with Tiger Woods being portrayed as being a vulnerable, nervous and thus likeable person, regarding about his impending return to golf.</p>
<p>News outlets these days are all about programming the cattle&rsquo;s thoughts, telling us what we ought to be thinking.<br>
And ironically there is very little diversity in opinion. </p>
<p>This particular story is a tarring and feathering, mountain out of a molehill, storm is teacup&hellip;.<br>
No matter what the race of this teenage prankster (as we all wait with baited breath to see), the lesson here is &#8220;world don&rsquo;t mess with Black people, as they are a protected species&#8221; and &ldquo;if you mess with them, we&rsquo;ll put your head in the stocks, humiliate your family and tarnish your name for life, no matter how little the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are so many much more important things to be thinking about<br>
Like how we are incrementally and softly losing our civilization, culture and historical legacy.</p>
<p>Thank God for the internet (in its current form.)<br>

<p>What&rsquo;s disturbing is that insulting blacks is an arrestable crime.</p>
<p>Or does anyone who reads this article seriously think that intimidation and racist violence are what motivated this.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but a tempest in a teapot.  I would have thought such an announcement was a joke in poor taste, nothing more.  I would have ignored it and kept shopping.  People who choose to take offense also get to reap the rewards of such a choice - their blood pressure goes up, the heart beats faster, stomach acids churn   &mdash;   is it really worth the price?</p>

		<p>The establishment is really scraping the bottom of the barrel for hate crimes against non-whites, which are committed by White people.</p>
<p>This is really small potatoes, but Whites have been so cowed by non-whites that this is the best &ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; that can found.</p>
<p>This kid, if he is lucky will only be executed for his hate crime and not gang-raped in prison, while waiting in vain for his appeal, which will be turned down.</p>
<p>His buddy for knowing him and not reporting him to the Thought Police may also be executed. </p>
<p>While I can be seen as exaggerating, a few years from now it may be the norm.</p>
<p>These kids should stick to rape, murder, money laundering, terrorism, treason and being a drug cartel, at least with these (if their crimes are against their fellow Whites), they have a chance in court with the establishment-probably become folk heroes&hellip;but thought crime, hate crime, they are doomed in the Star Chambers and Inquisitions of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; Amerika!<br>

		<p>Since a) the race of the youth is not being disclosed; b) he is not being charged with a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;; c) the NAACP spokesperson had sympathetic, coddling comments about him; it is safe to assume that he is NOT WHITE. It won&rsquo;t matter though. If his race is ever revealed the local paper(s) will bury it on page 46 of section Z and AP, Yahoo, etc. will never pick it up nationally. </p>
<p>As other posters have commented on this same story,  to hurt black feelings is a more heinous crime than black on white real crime is.  Dead or injured for life whites don&rsquo;t count; over sensitive bruised black egos must be pandered to endlessly. I hope more and more whites are waking up and mad as hell. If not the future is grim indeed.</p>
<p>BTW, what the hell is a &#8220;bias crime&#8221;? </p>

		<p>So a boy told black people to leave walMart. How many millions of white people have been told by lawless and violent dangerous behavior of certain Blacks to leave townss and cities built by whites?<br>
How many whites have been addressed with biased language toward them? And what would come of it if anyone that could do anything about it knew?</p>

		<p>   I have heard more media coverage of this prank then I did the whole time of the knoxville massacre where blacks raped, murdered, burnt and violated in many ways 2 white college kids out trying to have a good time.</p>
<p>   So a 16 yr old asks blacks to leave walmarts<br>
after the knoxville massacre i would be prone to ask them to please leave the country.</p>

		<p>On the one hand, what this boy did was inappropriate in a polite society, and he deserves some form of discipline.  Nobody can deny that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the NAACP (and, frankly, the entire black community in Gloucester) are doing what they always do: Blowing this as far out of proportion as they possibly can.  It&rsquo;s becoming so predictable to expect a disproportionate response from them: If there&rsquo;s any way these people can take advantage of the slightest instance of &#8220;racism&#8221;, they&rsquo;ll do it.  They always have to milk the &#8220;white guilt&#8221; cash cow until it&rsquo;s bone-dry.  That&rsquo;s why I find it impossible to feel any sympathy for them whatsoever, as much as I might find the kid&rsquo;s actions reprehensible.  How much do you want to bet that this incident will be rubbed in our faces for years to come as an example of how &#8220;white racism still lives&#8221;, while at the same, the NAACP will overlook the innumerable (racially motivated) black-on-white murders that will take place in the same period?</p>
<p>Also, if a black teenager had gone on the intercom and asked all white people to leave the store, would he have been charged with &#8220;bias intimidation&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s a rhetorical question, of course, and one that I&rsquo;m sure most of us contemplate whenever we read about incidents such as this.</p>
<p>Oh, and what the heck is &#8220;bias intimidation&#8221;, anyway?</p>

		<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t the FBI called in?  Maybe the CIA.  I think the failure of Obama to come to the Walmart personally shows a lack of leadership on his part.  Murders, rapes, burglaries, armed robberies&hellip; disproportionally committed by  16 year old blacks. Well, these are not so important.  But a COMMEMT??? - That probably 99% of the customers paid no attention to?  Now THATS important.  Oh yes indeedee.  Has the U.N. issued a statement on the matter?  Maybe Tiger Woods can offer some moral guidance &hellip;.Blah, blah, blah&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

		<p>First, what is the race of the 16 year old boy?<br>
It is not mentioned? Why!<br>
If the boy is white, it most certainly be mentioned,<br>
and we would never hear the end of it. The mass media<br>
will use this indict all whites for a single action of<br>
a white boy.<br>
If this boy is black, or non white. It will fast <br>
disappear from the news into a memory hole. Like so<br>
much black on white crime, and black on black crime<br>
gets pushed backed and treated if it never existed.<br>
We live in a sick society, that will only get sicker.<br>
Political correctness is the cancer of society, that<br>
will eat up all the vital organs that will ultimately<br>
cause civil society to disappear.</p>

		<p>Low-intellect individuals of all ethnicities tend to be paranoid and easily manipulated.  How many less-than-intelligent blacks, for instance, believe OJ and Michael Jackson are definitely innocent, the Duke lacrosse players are really guilty, or that the K really murdered all those children in Atlanta?  I&rsquo;ll bet the word in the ghetto after this  PA-system incident was that a Wal-Mart manager ordered all blacks out of the store or that the corporation is banning blacks!  Wal-Mart probably gets a lot of black business and thus overreacted to the event.</p>

		<p>On the one hand, what this boy did was inappropriate in a polite society, and he deserves some form of discipline. Nobody can deny that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To my mind, a big part of the problem is people like you who think that.</p>
<p>The REASON the kid did this prank.  The part that makes it funny.  Is the realization in the back of everyone&rsquo;s minds that blacks do bad things to whites because that is part of what it means to be black.  And because of that, they should not be allowed to live anywhere that whites live.</p>
<p>Further, whites are subjected to real racism every day.  Rape, murder, torture, violence of every conceivable kind, routinely and in great amounts, by blacks, for no other reason than the color of our skin.  Meanwhile, blacks play the victim&hellip;.even though there has not been a significant amount of white on black racism for generations.</p>
<p>What this kid did was a form of resistance.  The fact that it is funny at all, covers up something seriously wrong in what whites tolerate due to brainwashing.</p>
<p>The kid does not need some form of discipline.</p>
<p>You do.</p>

		<p>The 16-year old boy that was arrested and is being charged with &#8220;harassment and bias intimidation&#8221; is White (will find reference)  &mdash;  hence the blanket national news coverage.  </p>
<p>According to the AP, a New Jersey prosecutor and the Washington Township Police Chief arrested the boy.  </p>
<p>The POLICE CHIEF made the arrest and a prosecutor is already involved.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think the 16 year old were a murderer!  </p>
<p>Do the police chief and prosecutor not have better things to do in NJ, like arresting black-on-White murderers?</p>
<p>Does this not tell you the value of White Life in the eyes of law enforcement, the government, the media and academia?  A STUPID COMMENT from a 16-year old BOY elicits more response, outrage and coverage than does a WHITE MURDER.</p>
<p>You can be sure if he were non-White it would have been laughed off locally if at all and that would have been the end of it.</p>
<p>Instead, because it is a White involved in a possible &#8216;Hate Crime&rsquo; it is national news and has been for several days around here in California  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t seem to get away from this story.  Even a search on google shows it it being reported by CBS, NBC, the AP, Yahoo News and every large city paper.</p>
<p>Yet black-on-White murders continue unabated without a peep from the msm, the government or academia.</p>
<p>This is why Whites need to unite and assert our rights  &mdash;  we need a White race hustler to stand up and say ENOUGH!!  We are sick and tired of our people being treated like cattle, like non-entities when our children and elderly are being murdered, tortured and burned by black criminals.  If the government won&rsquo;t help us, we will take matters into our own hands to protect ourselves, our children, our elderly and our loved ones from rampant black criminals who target our people for murder, robbery and assault  &mdash;  and the media and government yawn.</p>
<p>No longer will we be ignored by a government and justice department that won&rsquo;t protect our people, be open to charges of ridiculous crimes that later prove to be pranks or hoaxes, be considered less than worthless while black criminals prey on our people at will.</p>
<p>We are tired of stories like this: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Just prior to Christmas Break 2006, healthy Eastern Michigan University coed Laura Dickinson passed away unexpectedly in her dorm room. There was no foul play, the school said. Well, they lied. In fact, officials had reason to be suspicious of a black student, Orange Amir Taylor III, 20. Eventually he was arrested for raping and killing Miss Dickinson. </p>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s father was devastated that the school had lied to them. &#8216;They let us bury her thinking that a healthy 22-year-old girl died by some freak accident.&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A rape and murder of a White lied about and covered up by officials, not reported by the media, but cotton balls and a stupid prank over a loud speaker illicit screams of racism, 24/7 coverage in the national news and demands of Hate Crimes and intimidation charges.</p>
<p>WE MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS TREATMENT OF OUR PEOPLE.</p>

		<p>Since officials are hiding the race of this prankster, saying that &#8220;it does not factor into the investigation&#8221;, we must assume that the kid was also black.</p>
<p>A funny prank, but like the &#8220;Compton Cookout&#8221; party organized by another black guy with a sense of humor, these incidents acquire lives of their own whenever the nation&rsquo;s bed-wetting classes get hold of the stories.</p>

		<p>Typically, when a Black commits a crime, race is left out of the news stories, then the whole story disappears.  Here, race is omitted, so we tend to assume the offender is Black, especially since these &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; are so often staged.  But if, as 37 Bon says, the kid is White, that would fit into the heavy news coverage, not to mention the overwhelming police investigation.  Do they put 13 detectives to work hunting down the typical murderer?   <br>
     As interested citizens, we are forced to rely on educated guesses to interpret the news, just like Soviet subjects had to when reading Pravda.  Whites have to be their own detectives and reporters these days, since the official ones are toadies of the regime.  </p>
<p>36 Anon: I agree, this is just a kid resisting as best he can.  Rude, but nothing more.  Some other poster wrote on an earlier article that he lives in a largely Black area.  If so, he has no doubt had a bellyful of diversity.  And I pity him when he goes back to school.  </p>

<p>1. Black and white women don&rsquo;t make good mothers.</p>
<p>2. Blacks and whites are generally prone to unlawful/criminal behaviors.</p>
<p>Are these symptoms of poor nurture or nature or both?</p>

<p>Extraordinary.  Apparently they do NOT have better things to do.    </p>
<p>Police chiefs do not make arrests. Cops do.  That is what cops are for. Not even sergeants make arrests (ordinarily)   &mdash;   much less chiefs.  The chief no more makes arrests than the mayor types his own letters and mops his own floors. That&rsquo;s grunt work. He has  cops and detectives for that. </p>
<p>Except in THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, that is!&hellip;  Such as high-priority cases where important people and publicity are involved.    You would think this prankster kid was the most wanted person in the USA.  (Maybe he was!)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably so long since the chief made an arrest (as a young cop) that he can&rsquo;t even remember how to fill out the paperwork.  Really! (I&rsquo;m sure someone else did it for him.)  After all, chiefs don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Someone should ask the chief how many other arrests he has made during his career in this title.  I can guarantee you the answer is  ZERO!   </p>
<p>So why this one?</p>

<p>No, the problem for our cause is people like yourself who are so driven by anger and hate that your instinctive reaction is to attack anybody who expresses the least bit of disagreement.  Even if said person is on your side (and yes, sir, I am a racially conscious white, or else I wouldn&rsquo;t read AR).</p>
<p>&#8220;You do.&#8221;</p>
<p>You obviously have serious anger issues.  Hotheads like yourself represent a step backwards, both intellectually and morally, from the standards that AR represents.</p>
<p>My white nationalism is driven by a love of my own, not a hatred of the other.  You are quite clearly the opposite, and you disgrace yourself, and the rest of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;What this kid did was a form of resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this boy did was a childish, idiotic prank, and I would support discipline for any teenager who did anything similar, regardless of their race.  If a black teenager got on a loudspeaker and demanded that all white people leave a store, I would argue that said child deserves discipline.  Why?  Because unlike the racist PC crowd, I do not have any double standards.</p>
<p>Yes, the blacks in Glouster are playing the Victim Card at the hint of the slightest &#8220;injustice&#8221;, the way they usually do.  And no, I am not the slightest bit sympathetic to their whining.  Since you obviously didn&rsquo;t read past the first sentence of my post, you overlook that I acknowledged this.  But being a racial realist does not mean engaging in childish behavior (as this boy did) and personal attacks (as you are doing to me now).</p>
<p>If your best excuse is, &#8220;That&rsquo;s what they do&#8221;, then you&rsquo;re stooping to the level of your enemy.  The fact that our cause may be right does not entitle us to act childish.  In case you have forgotten, what differentiates AR from the PC crowd is that its arguments are based on scientific research and REASON, not getting on a loudspeaker and shouting racial slurs.</p>
<p>That is why we will eventually succeed.  People like you are a threat to the gains that we have made.  I can only hope that you realize the error of your ways.</p>

		<p>Come to think of it&hellip; What this kid did, was a bad joke, yes. And I understand that many Black people may have been offended.</p>
<p>But you see, many Blacks will do lots of loathesome kinds, directed at Whites, like all those rappers who &#8220;sing&#8221; that they,d like to shoot a White man and rape his wife, etc, etc&hellip; And we are supposed to take it as though it was not racist&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time Black got a taste of their own medicine. I mean, they will often do things directed at Whites, and say it is art, or comedy, and that we shouild not be offended. So maybe we could tell Blacks: &#8220;Hey, what the boy did was a joke; can&rsquo;t you take one little joke, homeboy?&#8221;.</p>

Correct. A person who understands the subject and takes it seriously would not be treating it as a joke. It&rsquo;s not a joking matter.  This was a naive kid playing a kid&rsquo;s prank, not knowing what he was doing. A dumb prank, yes, completely thoughtless, but just a prank &hellip; nothing serious.  (For example, no Amrener would ever have done this. They&rsquo;d know better.)<br>
