			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Spencer, Alternative Right, March 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There is no college basketball team more hated and reviled than the Duke University Blue Devils. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duke can inspire love, too, of course, and a large fan base made up mostly of people who have no real connection to the school. {snip} ESPN&rsquo;s generous coverage of the Blue Devils speaks to these vicarious Dukies, but also to the millions who love to hate.  </p>
<p>For me, the source of Duke Hate has always been rather obvious .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and unmentionable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A lot of Duke Hate, no doubt, comes from a certain &#8220;preppiness&#8221; associated with its players .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a quality that was put into stark relief in the &rsquo;92 Championship Game, when clean-cut Duke went up again Michigan&rsquo;s &#8220;Fab Five&#8221; freshman, who had pioneered the hip-hop look of bald heads, baggy shorts, black sneakers and socks, and street-ball style.  {snip}</p>
<p>But this &#8220;preppiness&#8221; charge has always seemed to me like a euphemism for what really bothers people about the Blue Devils  &mdash;  during Coach K&rsquo;s tenure, his teams have been majority white, and with some notable exceptions like Grant Hill and Johnny Dawkins, Duke&rsquo;s most beloved/hated players have been Euro-Americans. People love to hate the Dukies because they stand as a flagrant violation of the trajectory of college and professional basketball over the past 30 years. Duke is white, they play white, and they win.</p>
<p>Duke 2009-10 squad is even blancher than usual. Led by All-ACC guard Jon Sheyer, Nordic Superman Kyle Singler, 7&rsquo;1&#8221; Slav Brian Zoubek, and the Plumlee bothers, Mason and Miles, Duke&rsquo;s starting line-up feature three, and sometimes even four, white players. Eleven of the 14 slots on Duke&rsquo;s roster are filled by Caucasians. </p>
<p>This comes in the context of the NCAA Division I being between 60-70 percent African-American (and the NBA, 80 percent so.) The top-ranked college programs of 2010 seem, if anything, to exceed the norm. Kentucky&rsquo;s starting five  &mdash;  and top 10 scorers  &mdash;  for instance, are all black.1 The United States&rsquo;s 2008 Olympic squad, the elite of the elite of American basketball, featured a total of zero white players. (The &rsquo;92 &#8220;Dream Team&#8221; had four, including [Christian] Laettner.) This trend is evident at the high-school level as well. As Sports Illusrated reported twelve years ago, in the inner cities, white kids have all but given up on playing competitive basketball.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before going into why the Dukies&rsquo; whiteness makes them so hated, it&rsquo;s worth asking how such a state of affairs ever came to pass  &mdash;  for a majority-white team might seem particularly surprising at a place like Duke. The school&rsquo;s undergraduate body might include many future &#8220;IBankers&#8221; (less so now, of course), and it&rsquo;s certainly more &#8220;fratty&#8221; than the Ivy League, but Duke&rsquo;s faculty is about as post-Marxist as you can get, exemplified by such pomo luminaries as Stanley Fish and Fredric Jameson. While I was rooting on the &rsquo;06 and &rsquo;07 teams during the heights of the &#8220;Duke Lacrosse Hoax,&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t know how Coach K got away with it  &mdash;  or how long the faculty would stand for a starting five that so represented White Privilege and the legacy of slavery.</p>
<p>The credit or blame, as it were, for Duke whiteness must surely lie on the shoulders of Mike Krzyzewski, not only the head coach but the man who signs off on every recruiting decision. Recruiting is, of course, a two-way street; recruits must choose Duke. But it&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that Duke gets the pick of the litter each year, and one must conclude that the fact that Coach K and his assistants key in on the best white players in the country is part of a deliberate plan. (And even if it&rsquo;s somehow unconscious, it&rsquo;s consistent.)</p>
<p>Krzyzewski is by no means a &#8220;racist,&#8221; as that term is usually used, nor does his commitment to recruiting quality run skin deep: according to the Encyclopedia of Duke Basketball, &#8220;Since 1976, only two players who didn&rsquo;t transfer or turn pro have failed to graduate.&#8221; All of Krzyzewski&rsquo;s star recruits were, in fact, four-year players until Elton Brand went pro early in 1999.</p>
<p>Put simply, each year, Coach K recruits the &#8220;golden boys,&#8221; young men who are highly skilled, fresh-faced, often white and handsome, sometimes cocky, and invariably intensely annoying to other fans who wished their players measured up. Duke has produced its share of NBA talent, but it&rsquo;s no coincidence that its most cherished players were all &#8220;college athletes.&#8221; Hurley, Laettner, Ferry, Cherokee Parks (who&rsquo;s white despite claiming some Indian blood), and Redick have all been either journeymen or busts in the pros. Steve Wojciechowski, Duke&rsquo;s floor-pounding point guard in the late &rsquo;90s, was one of the most well-known (and most loathed) players in the country at the time; after graduation, he played a year in Poland and then moved to the coaching bench beside Krzyzewski  &mdash;  proving that his game really was all about guts, brains, and heart.</p>
<p>Duke whiteness just doesn&rsquo;t work in the NBA  &mdash;  much like its intense, trapping defense and complicated, three-guard weaving patterns can&rsquo;t be transfered to the more primitive pro game, which has devolved into scenes of eight men standing around watching a man-é-mano matchup between each teams&rsquo; two best players. </p>
<p>Duke&rsquo;s current leader, John Sheyer, is archetypal in this respect. As ESPN&rsquo;s Jay Bilas, a white Duke grad and former coach, noted while covering a game this season, Sheyer has mastered playing &#8220;below the rim.&#8221; Doug Gottlieb blogged, &#8220;Scheyer is probably not an NBA player, but his Jewish faith allows him to get an Israeli passport and he would be one of the most coveted players EVER for a team like Maccabi Tel Aviv.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Duke Haters love to associate the Blue Devils with elitism and class privilege. But what&rsquo;s so unusual about the team is that its players are precisely those the world assumes can&rsquo;t compete in big time basketball. Christian Laettners aren&rsquo;t supposed to be able to even hang with Larry Johnsons. </p>
<p>Carolina&rsquo;s Dean Smith, Krzyzewski&rsquo;s arch-nemesis for years, is often credited with leading the drive for racial integration in the state of North Carolina by recruiting black athletes in the &rsquo;60s. Coach K has achieved much the opposite in creating a singular program in which Anglo-Saxons and Europeans stand tall once again in the game that James Naismith invented. </p>
<p>Why Coach K&rsquo;s recruiting sensibility would be so deathly annoying to opposing fans has a lot to do with an asymmetry in American basketball. Simply put, fans are mostly white, players are mostly black. (This has, no doubt, played a large part in the declining fortunes of the NBA, and it&rsquo;s something no PR genius can fix.)   </p>
<p>This asymmetry is, no doubt, experienced on a personal level by most fans. I myself was obsessed with sports as a young person, due in no small part to the fact that I grew up in the age of Sportscenter. But by the time I hit my 20s, this passion had waned considerably, to the point of disinterest. And I certainly hadn&rsquo;t chosen Duke in hopes of becoming one of the &#8220;Cameron Crazy.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>My interest in basketball had all but disappeared, but when I arrived in Durham, camping out all night in hopes of getting in the grad-student ticket lottery was just something one does. Period. And interestingly, this obligation was shared by my left-wing colleagues, who deconstructed Gender and Race by day and rooted on J.J. Redick by night. I even began playing pick-up basketball twice-a-week in a scrum that included both an ISI scholar and a nationally known liberal blogger.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I also learned that Coach K keeps a staff of specially selected waterboys, each of whom is required to wear a suit and tie to games, which makes for quite a strange scene when after every few possessions these well-dressed students would sprint onto the court and assiduously wipe sweat off the floor.</p>
<p>During a game against Clemson the full significance of Duke whiteness really hit me. I looked across the arena and observed our doppelgänger  &mdash;  Clemson fans who looked and dressed much like us (save the obvious) and were rooting almost as intensely .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though not quite. The Clemson all-black starting five, on the other hand, looked nothing like Greg Paulus and Josh McRoberts. The Tigers weren&rsquo;t quite the Running Rebs, but corn-rows and tattoos were in evidence. I realized then that, quite frankly, if I&rsquo;d gone to Clemson instead of Duke, I wouldn&rsquo;t have taken the slightest interest in the basketball team.</p>
<p>Much like nationalism, school spirit and winning can overcome quite a lot, but I doubt the Clemson fans could ever quite identify with their team like Dukies do. And I often wonder whether there isn&rsquo;t something deeply unhealthy about college students passionately rooting on players with whom they have little in common, and, I&rsquo;d add, with whom they&rsquo;d never associate were it not for basketball.</p>

		<p> Some excellent points were made here. And the last sentence said it all: These fans from other colleges who &#8220;hate&#8221; Duke, are really envious: &#8220;Why couldn&rsquo;t OUR team look like us?!&#8221;</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ll be sure to watch the game Duke is involved in this weekend. It will probably look like the Milan Indians vs. the Muncie Central Bearcats, circa 1954, again. And for those of you who aren&rsquo;t from Indiana and therefore don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about here, think of the plot of the movie &#8220;Hoosiers.&#8221; In Milan, as in Hickory, as in (I hope) Duke, the &#8220;good&#8221; (White) guys won.</p>

		<p>We really need to eliminate this term &#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; from our lexicon.</p>
<p>Caucasians are Kurds, Georgians, and Azherbezanies, and don&rsquo;t even speak an Indo European langauge. In Russia, they aren&rsquo;t even considered &#8216;white.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We should call ourselves either Indiginous Europeans or Diaspora Europeans to take our culture into account as well as the color of our skin.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s another way of saying that Duke has more students of European ancestry than Ivy League schools.  Due the overrepresentation of Jews and Asians, Europeans are between 20-30% of the undergraduates in the Ivy League.  Europeans are actually more underrepresented than blacks at Ivy League schools.  </p>

		<p>There are 4 colleges/universities in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina:  UNC Chapel Hill, NC State (Raleigh), Duke (Durham) and North Carolina Central (Raleigh).  NCC is closest to Duke, as I recall, and is a &#8220;traditionally black&#8221; school.  It was where all the black kids went when the white kids went to Duke, and to a lesser extent the other two schools.  NCC is today still primarily black, and &#8220;by choice, not by mandate&#8221;, as the then-head of UNCCH&rsquo;s music dept. once informed me in 1976.  The fact is, Duke, a private university, has ALWAYS been primarily white; its alumni are primarily white, and a huge amount of Duke&rsquo;s money comes from the wealthy alums, who aren&rsquo;t all that interested in seeing Duke become &#8220;more integrated.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s just that tradition plus alums, in Duke&rsquo;s case, create the mostly white basketball teams - which is kind of a nice thing, I think anyway!</p>

		<p>I was not ware there was &#8220;white&#8221; basketball any more than &#8220;jewish&#8221; physics our &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; genetics. I am no more bothered by the dominance of African descended players in sports that I am - or ought to be - about a comparable Jewish hegemony in physics. It seems the great genetic breeding experiment of the Middle Passage and plantation slavery combined to create a breed of men who are better at basketball.</p>

		<p>You need a high IQ to stay in Duke(or Northwestern, Vanderbilt or Stanford). That means white. A high IQ basketball game is a winning game. Unfortunately, the other schools lack intelligent players, ie white players,or want to mimic the NBA and also be NBA farm schools.</p>

		<p>On the one hand, the media always complain about low player graduation rates every early January (to correspond with the BCS football games) and mid-March (to correspond with the NCAA tourney) for big time college football and basketball players, respectively.  But Duke has a high graduation rate, yet the mainstream sports media despise them.</p>
<p>I have a lot of problems with Duke, which became perfectly apparent after the LAX non-scandal, but they have nothing to do wit this.</p>
<p>Also, Butler, another team in the Final Four, seems to be doing it the right way.  They had the third best graduation rate in the past however-many years SI measured it for all teams in the 65-field tourney.  And whaddaya know   &mdash;   Butler&rsquo;s team is way whiter than the normal Division I squad.  However, Butler was in the news in the last few weeks for a much worse reason   &mdash;   The Chancellor (?) disinvited Chief Justice John Roberts from speaking at commencement (?) in May, because of his &#8220;right-wing extremism.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The final 4 teams are about 60% white (though the starters are still mostly black for Michigan St. and West Virginia). A Duke-Butler match up would often see 7 whites on the floor at one time.</p>
<p>Also, all-white teams from Europe often beat all-black teams from the U.S. in international competitions.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous 7:53 p.m:</p>
<p>     I&rsquo;m a bit suprised by your assertion of blacks being better bastketball players than whites. Fundementaly speaking, they&rsquo;ve actually ruined the sport. Thirty or forty years ago, there were a number of great black players. Greater white players as well. </p>
<p>     Also, i think the main theme is being overlooked here in this article. The fact is, white players also achieve &#8220;what&rsquo;s more important greater academic scores&#8221; than the black players. Even teams, where most of the players are black, the minority white players on the bench, again, achieve higher grade scores. This simple fact alone must iritate a number of blacks.  </p>

<p>Phil, I&rsquo;m wth you! Years ago when a White people in the U.S. identified himself as Caucasian it was understood to be a White person of European descent. Well, those days are sure gone. </p>
<p>Every once in a while I&rsquo;ll do a survey over the phone for something or other and when they get to the demographics part and ask my race I&rsquo;ll say European. If I&rsquo;m feeling rather b****y(rhymes with witchy) that day I just tell them I&rsquo;m Irish. </p>
<p>But I do like your idea of Indigenous European or European Diaspora. That&rsquo;s even better. I think I&rsquo;ll try Indigenous European next time.</p>
<p>By the way, on the Census I ignored the Hispanic nonsense and put my race as Irish. And no, I didn&rsquo;t give them my phone number.    <br>

<p>NO! My understanding is that those folks do speak an Indo-European language. </p>
<p>Back to basketball. Duke has rigorous academic requirements. I think some years ago it was pointed out that ONLY two of the major schools had such rigorous academics for their student-athletes. Notre Dame was one and Duke was the other.</p>
<p>Coach K, what they call him, is merely choosing players that play the type of ball that he used to play when he starred, what was it for: West Point? What is called &#8220;white basketball&#8221;. And I bet he does not tolerate &#8220;trash talking&#8221; either.<br>

		<p>Meh&hellip;. Interesting article but somewhat superficial. In any event there are schools with pre-predominately Black teams that have superior basketball programs.<br>
I will say I think the future is ripe for white American basketball players, great Black players will go straight to the league or play in Europe instead of going to play college ball. </p>

<p>Sorry, but I disagree with that.<br>
Caucasian is one of the best terms in America. If you as a German say &#8220;white&#8221;, everyone will tell you: So some kurds are looking white too, how about them.<br>
If you say blue-eyed, not all whites have blue eyes but some blacks does.<br>
If you say Indiginous Europeans, it suggest you are only talking about Europeans but hiding that somehow the fact that white people in arab area of today and Egypt invented so much.</p>
<p>For that caucasian is a very good term. Furthermore if we have learned one thing of the Ni&hellip; I mean bla&hellip; I mean Afro&hellip; I mean whatever, it is that changing the name doesn&rsquo;t change the picture the people have about it. </p>
<p>Caucasian is very clear. It is well defined and everyone knows what it means.</p>

		<p>Why the over-analysis?  White players succeeding perennially at a game that is thought to be &#8220;owned&#8221; by the black man.  Of course they hate Duke.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know how Coach K got away with it &mdash; or how long the faculty would stand for a starting five that so represented White Privilege and the legacy of slavery.&#8221;  That sums this article up for me.  The leftist and Marxists must just HATE that he can be so successful recruiting, winning, and graduating white players year and year out.</p>
<p>Critics of Krzyzewski ought to know that they are not even remotely qualified to criticize ANYTHING about him related to basketball.  He recruits basketball players that have character, morals, values, intelligence, and darn good basketball skill.  Those are rare combinations to find year in and year out to achieve at such a high consistent rate for decades.  After which a very high level of them graduate.  There is only ONE thing people can hate about these young men.  We know what that is.  They just like to blame it on the athletes&rsquo; &#8220;preppiness.&#8221;   Guess what, RACISTS, you&rsquo;re not fooling anyone here! </p>

<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;ve always likened watching basketball to watching paint dry, only perhaps a bit more somnolent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to make a point of watching a Duke game, if only from an anthropological perspective. </p>

		<p>Sheesh, such brainwashing at play.</p>
<p>This confused kid is ashamed of his own skin, literally. He is assuming whites are evil, and that being white is some sort of problem apparently. And his tone certainly indicates he believes that hatred for whites is somehow normal.</p>
<p>But for all his babbling the great irony of this article is his inability to just deal with the actual reason why his team is white - because the playes are held to Duke&rsquo;s ACADEMIC standards in addition to the athletic ones.</p>
<p>Of course, he can&rsquo;t go there. That would involve logic, and therefore the logical conclusion that there are racial differences - or at least the idea that blacks just can&rsquo;t compete in the classroom.</p>
<p>So instead he just keeps babbling about some mysterious &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; nonsense.</p>

		<p>It is amazing that the usually almost all-white student bodies of other universities will cheer on their all-black team against Duke.</p>
<p>In an understatement of epic proportions to say the reverse would never happen.</p>

		<p>One of the best college games I ever saw was in the mid-70&rsquo;s, when the thinking man&rsquo;s team, Princeton (80% White), was matched against Rutgers (100% black). Due to a flagrant foul that was not called, ghetto-style basketball prevailed, but it was a real nail-biter to the end.</p>

		<p>  The college I attended quite a few years ago also had a winning ALL white team, and frequently beat the mostly or all black teams that they played. The black opponents and fans did not take it well, and there were confrontations that never seemed to get mentioned in the local media. It was an interesting time to be a campus security officer. We were not armed, although I must confess to covertly bending that rule when we played certain teams. My life was more important to me than being a glorified security guard sacrificed to political correctness. Most blacks know that person for person, they are not our intellectual equals, but they seem to think that athletic prowess is or should be thir exclusive province.</p>

		<p>If you want to see the last hold out of white athletes in college sports, it&rsquo;s not in basketball, but in football, at least in the Ivy league. Schools that still continue the sport (Harvard and Yale to name two) do not give out athletic scholarships for football and each player on the team is a student-athlete; they were good enough to get into the school on their own academic merits, yet they are still recruited for their athletic skills. You can imagine the racial composition of those teams. <br>
I once heard a Harvard coach speak of his recruiting methods. He basically said, and I paraphrase here, &#8220;I can&rsquo;t give you any money or financial help to come to school here and play football, but when you do graduate, you will leave with a Harvard degree that you have truly earned.&#8221; <br>
You can&rsquo;t say that about many schools at all-at least not today.  </p>

<p>Nonsense. Baseball, wrestling, hockey, volleyball, tennis, golf, field hockey, soccer and most other college sports are over 90% white. Even college football is over 50% white.</p>

		<p>I saw a clip from &#8220;The Daily Show&#8221; or whatever that show is that has that liberal comedian sitting there &#8220;reporting&#8221; news by mocking and making fun of conservatives.  I am not talking about the show that has the guy with the glasses but the other show that is similar.  Anyways, I actually know liberals who use that show as their only news source.  Go figure.</p>
<p>Anyways, recently the host of the show was making fun of that coach who is in the news lately for wanting to start an all-white basketball league.  The entire segment consisted of clipped and biased versions of interviews demonstrating the coach&rsquo;s &#8220;viewpoints&#8221; as well as mocking statements from the interviewer which involved comments such as &#8220;how dare black people who are better at basketball than whites be allowed to dominate?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The whole irony here disgusted me.  Here they are making a big deal over a white coach who is being &#8220;racist&#8221; by wanting an all white basketball league since he wants basketball to return to the good old days when it was more sportsmanlike and less thuggish&hellip;..while at the same time they were mocking him with statements conveying that white people are lacking in basketball skills compared to blacks.  They even had &#8220;demonstrations&#8221; to prove it.</p>
<p>What sickened me was how the audience seemed stunned and shocked whenever the white coach would say something &#8220;racist&#8221; against blacks, while in the mean time the audience would laugh hysterically whenever whites were mocked for their clumsiness on the basketball court.  Reading the comments that came after the video disgusted me even more.  It seems that so many white people just don&rsquo;t have a clue STILL.  If that &#8220;news&#8221; clip from this comedy show didn&rsquo;t set white people on edge, I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like the use and the abuse of the word diaspora.</p>
<p>The word implies a forced dislocation of captives, prisoners, or refugees.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the way blacks and Jews through the word around because neither are being forced to stay in any place or in any kind of captivity. No one is being forced to live where they live and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like where they live (and continue to do nothing but blame the host population), are free to leave.</p>
<p>Those of us of European descent made a choice to come here. We are not captives or prisoners of history. <br>

		<p>@Patriot.  are you saying that the *author of the article* is anti-white?  If so, I think you are wrong.  The author is *defending* the skills and teamwork of white players, and traditional &#8220;white&#8221; basketball  &mdash;  and explaining why Duke&rsquo;s success is sticking in the craw of the MSM, pro-black crowd. They can&rsquo;t stand Duke because the university has a lot of whites and has a white image.  Duke is *seen as* a bastion of white privilege and success.  that&rsquo;s why the msm, pro-black crowd cannot stand to see Duke win.  The author of this article is dissecting he psychology of hatred of Duke.  He is also attacking self-hating whites.</p>

		<p>The last bit of the article makes an excellent point, the over-the-top support white Duke fans have for the team is obviously because they can identify more with the team members.</p>
<p>The first half of the article that compares a white team to white privilege/racism ruins the last part, and is immensely disgusting.</p>

		<p>I just love the idea of a White college basketball team that wins over Black or majority Black teams!</p>
<p>I was never really able to cheer for Black athletes competing in any sport, to be frank. I want, and I need, to cheer for athletes who look like me; and with whom I might have a certain number of things in common. It&rsquo;s as simple as that, and I think it&rsquo;s perfeclty natural. It is based on instinct, I think.</p>
<p>Plus, I am so sick of what seems like some kind of ploy by the mainstream media, to show Blacks as physically superior beings, or whatever&hellip;</p>

<p>I have been coaching high school (Boys an Girls) basketball for over 15 years, and you can&rsquo;t teach basketball fundamentals to 90% of the blacks. Every one of them believes they can get a scholarship to college and then play NBA. To see real basketball played you need to watch college and NBA games from 30 + years ago, that&rsquo;s real basketball.</p>
