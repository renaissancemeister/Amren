			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Medha Sood, TopNews (Mohali, India), March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A study on the black community in Montreal conducted by the McGill University, has revealed that blacks still face invisible barriers that lead to their socio-economic backwardness.</p>
<p>A report by the Montreal Consortium on Human Rights Advocacy Training, led by Professor Jim Torczyner, claims, &#8220;Blacks continue to lag significantly behind non-blacks on every indicator of success&#8221;.</p>
<p>Statistics show that the ratio of unemployment among blacks in Montreal is more than twice as high as that of the whites. The average annual income of blacks is $22,701, compared with $34,196 of the population as a whole.</p>
<p>The condition of women and children is also deplorable. Almost 1‚ÅÑ2 of the black children in Montreal live below the poverty line and 1/4th of women aged 15 years or more are single mothers.</p>
<p>Blacks also lag behind in the professional sphere. Even if they are armed with an equivalent or better degree they earn considerably lesser amount as compared to whites.</p>
<p>These figures seem to support the report released by the United Nations which shows that Montreal is one of several cities where ethnic Canadians face unbridled prejudice in policing, education and labor.<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this before. Blacks achieve less than whites and then the specious assertion that this is due to white prejudiced is made. Obviously such prejudice doesn&rsquo;t exist, that&rsquo;s why its &#8220;invisible.&#8221; That being said, if one starts with the false premise that blacks are equal in ability to whites then this is a very logical conclusion.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These figures seem to support the report released by the United Nations which shows that Montreal is one of several cities where ethnic Canadians face unbridled prejudice in policing, education and labor.&#8221;  Here we go again, assuming that every black failure is the result of &#8220;prejudice&#8221;.  Just yesterday I had to call my health insurance company and I spoke to two different women.  The first was black and her attitude was that she was doing me a favor just by speaking to me.  She mumbled and clearly had a chip on her shoulder.  The second woman was almost certainly white and her attitude was the exact opposite.  She showed empathy and went out of her way to help.  I&rsquo;ve had this same experience many many times - and so have thousands of others. If blacks, especially black women, wish to defeat stereotypes, they must make sure that more of them change their own attitudes and behaviors.  This is the ONLY thing that can make a difference.</p>

		<p>What this article fails to mention is that most of the blacks living in Montreal are from Haiti. The Haitian population in Montreal is about 86,000 indviduals representing about eight percent of the total population. If considered as a group, these Haitians are not getting most of the jobs because their numbers are relatively small. This is not prejudice, this is simple logic and arithmetic. </p>

		<p>    Again and again, we start with an unequal and double standard premise; the premise is that we are all equal but yet, whites have to be the producers of an educational system to &#8221; educatre non-whites,be inventive and produce a commercial product and hire non-whites at the so-called proper percentage; which means what is advantages to minorities. Where is the government in any Western civilizationcountry holding minorities to the same education and economic standards that they hold white-Christians ? It doesn&rsquo;t and hasn&rsquo;t existed; there is your &#8221; racism &#8221; and its against European cultural people since the mid-sixties universally.</p>

		<p>The key to this article is the phrase &#8220;&hellip;blacks still face invisible barriers that lead to their socio-economic backwardness.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the barriers are invisible they can never been seen, they can never be defined, they can never be confronted.</p>
<p>One cannot argue with this - therefore the argument goes on forever. It will always &#8220;explain&#8221; black failure but never honestly face black failure. Why? Because it&rsquo;s invisible.</p>
<p>How bogus is this getting? It&rsquo;s like me saying I&rsquo;m always late for work in the morning because the invisible monster hid my keys and my supervisor saying, &#8220;Well, that explains it. Here&rsquo;s your paycheck.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article is much easier to understand if you simply add the phrase &#8220;everywhere in the world&#8221; to the end of each general statement.  Examples:</p>
<p><i>blacks still face invisible barriers that lead to their socio-economic backwardness</i> EVERYWHERE in the world.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Blacks continue to lag significantly behind non-blacks on every indicator of success&rdquo;</i> EVERYWHERE in the world. </p>
<p><i>The condition of [black] women and children is also deplorable</i> EVERYWHERE in the world. </p>
<p>&hellip;and so on.  <br/>
It&rsquo;s really quite simple - blacks are blacks everywhere in the world.  They don&rsquo;t have what it takes to be anything else.  </p>

		<p>My God, how much more proof does the world need to show that blacks are absolutely unable, as a group, to produce anything of merit, no matter where they live???  Unless blacks have white or Asian blood, they do not achieve success as a group, and usually as individuals.  They ARE inferior in intelligence and low on the social evolutionary scale - but undoubtedly superior in physical prowess.  As for the Hindu caste system, originally it was not determined by one&rsquo;s birth, but by one&rsquo;s innate talents.  It was a good and sensible system when it originated.  But when it became rigidly tied to birth parents, it became corrupt and unjust.  India is a poor and backward country on the outside.  But on the inside, India is home to some of the greatest spiritual masters ever to walk this earth,- but Westerners generally are not able to see past the externals, and, without a belief in reincarnation, cannot perceive the truth of the masters&rsquo; teachings at all.</p>

<p>(insert anything that does not include the word &#8220;black) leads to socioeconomic backwardness of blacks.</p>
<p>Aparently, the sun itself rises and sets to torture poor blacks, my word, how did blacks even survive to birth, what with the entire universe out to keep them down.</p>

		<p>Look up the tern &#8220;Panchama.&#8221; In fact, don&rsquo;t, because Google will not auto-fill it in for you&hellip;a banned word. And when you search yourself, you wil find sterilized versions of history (sterilized with outright lies) that state that the Panchamas (untouchables) of India are/were only designated as such by way of their occupations, such as slaughterer of livestock. Utter and complete lies. They were very darlk-skinned, quite black in fact. That&rsquo;s precisely why they were ony allowed to do the &#8220;jobs that real Indians wouldn&rsquo;t do.&#8221;  The blackest are/were aboriginals who kind of resemble Australian Aborigines&hellip;they look a world apart from the Indo-European Brahmins who historically ruled India. In fact, they look almost alien to the  modern human race.<br/>
What a pack of lies this whitewashed history is. And so it has been in the world, I suppose, but today, the ENTIRE WORLD is under the yoke of such lies. Never before have so many people been hoodwinked and brainwashed. PC has perpetrated an evil of previouslu unimagined proportions; controling and manipulating the information and education of billions.<br/>

<p>Every time I run across this phrase &#8220;ethnic canadians&#8221; it confuses me for a minute because it&rsquo;s a misnomer. The only &#8220;ethnic canadians&#8221; are white. The rest are just foreigners.</p>

<p>We get the impression that some artificial force is pressing blacks down into an unnatural condition of backwardness.  &#8220;Leading&#8221; them, as it says, into this condition, instead of this being where they always were. </p>
<p>The fact is, that blacks in Canada go there in order to obtain better conditions of life. And they do.  They are far, far better off there than they ever were in their countries of origin, or they wouldn&rsquo;t be going there, nor would they stay.  So no one has led them into backwardness, but out of it.</p>

		<p>Marriage is an economic arrangement as much as anything else.  A female trades sex and domestic work for the security and resources a male can provide.  Females get more benefits from marriage than males do, although marriage does make men live slightly longer due to more regularity in their habits.</p>
<p>The propblem in dysfunctional cultural groups is that the social heirarchy is non-existent.  Strong fathers who would look out for the interests of their daughters are not present, as the children were born out of wedlock to men or teenage boys who feel no social pressure to take care of what they made.  (Mothers have no store of wisdom passed on from mother to daughter either.)   </p>
<p>Such ragtag males are constantly on the prowl for new &#8216;conquests&rsquo; and there are no social stigmas against it.  They follow animal instincts and have no time for deep thought or contemplation about the meaning of their actions in the long term.  They also fight male rivals (gang warfare) and claim the females as trophies.</p>
<p>This perpetuates the dysfunction generation after generation, and merely sticking such people around functional cultures, such as injecting &#8216;low income housing&rsquo; people in the middle of a nice town does not alleviate the problem.  The wild males merely look upon the docile people around them as new targets.  That&rsquo;s why you see that wherever the voodoos go, they rush at the white girls so fast and cow the white males into submission.</p>
<p>Their own girls have no options because the good boys from the functional society don&rsquo;t want diseases, attitude or girls who are already pregnant with their thrd child by as many men.</p>
<p>All that happens is that the good people of the town go in &#8216;circle the wagons&rsquo; mode, and then outsiders charge them with racism.  After violence and dysfunction infect the schools, the public spaces and every other aspect of life, the functional culture moves, which is known as white flight.</p>
<p>Then the neighborhood is now &#8216;blighted&rsquo; and white racism is blamed.  Soon, the voodoos are moved to a new white town and the process begins anew.  This will go on in this country until there is nowhere left to go.  By that time, whites will be a similar percentage of the population as in South Africa, and migration to Iceland will commence.</p>

<p>That is hilarious :-D<br/>
And a very good argument also!</p>
<p>All anti-racist campaigns target at only talking about the situation of blacks in very small white areas. If we keep on saying this is all over the world and asking &#8220;name me a place where this is not the case. name me a place where blacks are in advantage rich.&#8221; they will lose all their arguments.</p>
<p>For Example:<br/>
-&#8220;Blacks are more violent than whites in french because of their poverty&#8221; - no! all around the world. name me a place where they aren&rsquo;t.<br/>
-&#8220;Black Community is not good at Philadelphia  schools because they face racism&#8221; - no! they are bad at all school around the world. name me one place they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That is great</p>
