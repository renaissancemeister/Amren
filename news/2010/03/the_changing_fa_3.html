<h1>The Changing Faces of Brandon</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Simpson, Globe and Mail, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To the uninitiated, the Brandon art gallery might seem to be an unlikely place to hear Spanish. But the other day, three young women were studying a painting and chattering in Spanish.</p>
<p>Hang around Brandon for a little while, and you&rsquo;ll see signs in Mandarin and Ukrainian, too, because a demographic shift has hit this Manitoba city of 45,000 people.</p>
<p>English, Spanish, Mandarin and Ukrainian are the &#8220;official languages&#8221; used inside the Maple Leaf Foods hog-processing plant, the largest employer in Brandon. About 2,100 hourly workers (all unionized) toil at the plant; 70 per cent of them are from China, El Salvador, Honduras, Mauritius, Mexico and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Their arrival in the past decade, and especially in the past five years, is changing  &mdash;  and challenging  &mdash;  Brandon. It&rsquo;s an example in an unlikely place of what Statistics Canada reported this week: the upsurge in visible minority populations.</p>
<p>Most of the upsurge is occurring in the large cities and the suburbs that surround them. Courtesy of the Maple Leaf plant that opened in 1999, that upsurge is being felt in Brandon.</p>
<p>In the plant&rsquo;s early years, employee turnover was almost 100 per cent a year, a company spokesman said. About a quarter of the work force was aboriginal. The hours were strict and the work  &mdash;  what the company calls &#8220;disassembling&#8221; hogs  &mdash;  was hard and repetitive. The aboriginals left, but so did almost all of the original employees.</p>
<p>The company tried recruiting in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, but with little success. The first Mexican workers came as part of a pilot program in 2002, and the influx has continued.</p>
<p>The amazing part of the influx  &mdash;  and the good news for Brandon  &mdash;  is how many workers stay on after their two-year temporary work visa. They apply for permanent status, bring their families and settle down. Some of their wives quickly enter the work force in fast-food restaurants and other entry-level jobs.</p>
<p>Last year, the company counted 1,812 people it had brought to the plant, of whom it had retained 1,457. Recently, about 250 Chinese workers became eligible for permanent residency. Only nine did not avail themselves of the opportunity, and 40 of them bought houses as soon as their permanent status was confirmed.</p>
<p>When vacancies arrive, the company has to convince the Canadian government that it&rsquo;s trying to find Canadian employees. But local unemployment is very low, as it is across Manitoba. And Canadians apparently don&rsquo;t want to work in this kind of plant.</p>
<p>Potential immigrants do. The company&rsquo;s last overseas recruiting effort was in Honduras. Maple Leaf representatives interviewed 600 applicants there and offered jobs to 88.</p>
<p>Brandon had experienced small waves of immigrants before, but that was long ago. The eastern Europeans who arrived have been thoroughly absorbed, although self-reliant Hutterite colonies still dot the landscape of southwestern Manitoba. So having people from El Salvador, China and Honduras was not exactly something for which Brandon was prepared.</p>
<p>Brandon was a kind of &#8220;set in its ways&#8221; city, with its old university, community college and agriculture service industries. It has voted Conservative federally forever. The provincial NDP can win one seat in the east end of the city, but the rest is blue, as are all the rural ridings.</p>
<p>At dinner the other night with community leaders, and during a conversation with the mayor, it seemed Brandon is largely very supportive of the immigrants. Yes, there are challenges for the school system in teaching English as a second language. (A program financed by governments, the union and the company offers English instruction to about 1,300 employees.) Housing in the city is tight. And there is the Canada-wide problem of having people working in a hog-processing plant who have professional qualifications from their native countries.</p>
<p>But a survey taken last year showed 89-per-cent approval of the immigrants in Brandon, especially since there have been few run-ins with police and the immigrants have helped to keep the city&rsquo;s population from declining. The decision of so many plant workers to settle in Brandon displays a commitment that impresses residents.</p>
<p>Community leaders, satisfied thus far, ask the right questions. Can we continue to keep the arrivals? Can our educational system cope? Can we avoid intercommunal misunderstandings?</p>
<p>So far, though, so good.<br>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Brandon go across the border and give jobs to at least 1000 Detroit teenagers? Heck, they could save travel costs and go for Seattle or Portland.  Both cities have a black teen age unemployment figure of 20%. It would be a scream watching the nightly news as well mannered Mounties drag &#8220;brothas&#8221; to the constable&rsquo;s office while ducking the garbage and bullets fired at them by the &#8220;brothas&rsquo;s mothas.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the work was awful, the pay was awful, and the solution is to lobby government to bring in slaves from third world countries.</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>

<p>This statement stinks like&hellip;well, a hog processing plant. Atlantic Canada is in a perpetual state of high-unemployment, and has been for years. Their young people flee the area for hope of work in (wait for it)&hellip;the prairie provinces, like Manitoba!</p>
<p>If the NDP isn&rsquo;t salivating at the influx of dimwitted third-worlders, then they aren&rsquo;t paying attention.</p>

		<p>Canada has been taken over, not by immigrants, but by Bay Street (the Canadian counterpart to Wall Street).</p>
<p>This great country, full of natural resources, is the playground of an elite financial oligarchy.</p>
<p>These robbers pacify the naive populace with a non-stop, heavily funded, feel good multicultural propaganda campaign, to deflect attention away from their pillaging. </p>
<p>They effectively contol immigration policy.  When they have a resource and lack a workforce to exploit it, they go to the &#8216;global labor marketplace&rsquo; to match it to foreign labor. Canada now has the highest per capita immigration in the world, and nary a word of protest, thanks to the multicultural koolaid.</p>
<p>Canada needs to fall hard to wake the people from their stupor.  </p>

		<p>Two things can be construed from Brandon&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>If it is announced that a meat packing plant wants to build in your area, claiming it&rsquo;s bringing employment, DIG IN YOUR HEALS AND FIGHT AGAINST IT TOOTH AND NAIL.</p>
<p>Secondly, those third worlders may be doing the work today, but once they are the majority in that community, they will become demanding, unruly, violent and intractable employees.  AND, their KIDS won&rsquo;t be seeking work where dad and mom work.  They will be hanging on the corners forming gangs.  </p>

		<p>Oh really? Canada doesn&rsquo;t have enough unemployed workers to fill their hog factories? That seems hard to believe, if the unemployment there is anything like it is here in the United States. What a load of liberal bull-hockey. And trust me, if 89% of all the citizens of Brandon (a figure which I find almost impossible to believe) support immigration now, they won&rsquo;t for very long. Just wait till immigrants start arriving in larger numbers and taking higher-paying jobs.</p>

		<p>Rather than improve working conditions and raise the pay (and explain to their customers why meat has to cost more) the Maple Leaf plant did what our corporate masters always do&hellip; import cheap third world labor.  The profits have been privatized, the costs of greater burdens on the public schools, more crime, and social balkanization have been socialized.  The left, which in your grandfather&rsquo;s day was pro-labor, is all in favor of this.</p>
<p>We all know the same thing happens in the United States.  Meat packers find some poor town desperate for jobs and get tax breaks and zoning variances as incentives to build a plant.  Once built the packers import a bunch of illegal aliens to do the work and none of the locals gets a job.<br>

<p>Ah, the same old tired argument, &#8220;they do the work that Americans, Canadians or whomever won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; Where have I heard that before? The person who quoted this forgot to complete the real meaning of the sentence &#8220;apparently Canadians don&rsquo;t want to work in this kind of plant&hellip; for slave wage labor  because they can&rsquo;t afford to pay taxes and still feed their families on slave wages&#8221;. There now, sentence complete.</p>

		<p>I got a call from a professional recruiter last year - they wanted to know if I could think of anyone with a specific set of skills to relocate to Brandon, Manitoba and take a professional job there. I forwarded the query about, but I must confess I&rsquo;d thought seriously about looking into it myself. And chief among my interests in relocating was the thought that surely in Brandon could I leave multiculturalism behind. Guess not! These third-worlders are everywhere these days - Alaska, small town Canadian prairies, Scandinavia, Nebraska, Maine&hellip; need I go on? There&rsquo;s just seemingly no place to go to anymore that&rsquo;s truly majority white. A colleague of mine wants to relocate to Idaho, but I can&rsquo;t see how that state either will be immune to the third world tsunami.</p>

<p>The companies don&rsquo;t even have to import the slave labor themselves, our respective governments do it for them since there&rsquo;s still lots of Somalis and Haitians left. </p>
