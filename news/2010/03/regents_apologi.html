<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>University of California leaders Wednesday apologized to black UC San Diego students for recent racial incidents at the campus and proposed changes in admissions policies aimed at boosting enrollment of minorities across the system.</p>
<p>UC President Mark G. Yudof and other UC regents acknowledged that the UC San Diego episodes, including an off-campus student party that mocked Black History Month, has brought attention to the low enrollment of African American students on the campus. About 1.6% of UC San Diego undergraduates are black, among the lowest such figures for any UC campus. The UC leaders promised to help create campus environments in which minority students feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>Speaking during a regents meeting at UC San Francisco, Yudof said he wanted all UC campuses to adopt an admissions process known as &#8220;holistic&#8221; review, in which applicants&rsquo; test scores and high school grades are considered in the context of their life experiences and personal accomplishments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holistic review is permitted at the university, but Yudof said he would like it to be required at all nine UC undergraduate campuses. UCLA and UC Berkeley now use the approach most extensively, while others, including UC San Diego, rely on a more rigid formula that allows less consideration of personal accomplishments and, Yudof said, may unfairly reject otherwise academically eligible low-income and minority students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, UC regents adopted sweeping changes in undergraduate admissions policies that were designed partly to boost the number of low-income and minority students without violating the state&rsquo;s ban on racial affirmative action. Starting with freshmen entering in fall 2012, applicants will no longer need to take two SAT subject exams, although the main SAT test would still be required. The change also will widen the pool of students eligible to be considered for admission based on high school grades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But [Regent Eddie Island] also blamed UC&rsquo;s admissions policies for artificially limiting the rolls of minority students. &#8220;It is the absence of inclusion that frees hatred, that frees bigotry, that allows it to go unchallenged. That&rsquo;s our biggest problem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Black student leaders from UC San Diego addressed the regents and said that the controversial party, a so-called Compton Cookout at which guests were invited to dress like ghetto residents, was just the tipping point after decades of blacks feeling marginalized on campus. {snip}</p>

<p>I looked it up:  For the undergraduate class admitted for the fall of 2009, the demographics are:</p>
<p>Asian: 46%<br>
Caucasian: 26%<br>
Mexican-American: 10%<br>
Other Latino: 3%<br>
Filipino: 4%<br>
African-American: 2%<br>
Other/Undeclared: 10% </p>
<p>Add Asian and Filipino, and it&rsquo;s half Asian.  Assume the 10% of &#8220;other/undeclared&#8221; are whites who think there&rsquo;s no such thing as race, and no more than 36% them are white.  Looks like whites are a minority there.</p>

		<p>The people in control at the universities need to stop playing PC and admit the truth   &mdash;   that people are prejudiced against blacks primarily because of (a) the blacks&rsquo; behavior in and out of school, (b) the fact that so many blacks are behind and have to have remedial classes in college, which takes money and professors away from people who are qualified to be there, and (c) blacks squall the loudest about needing money and help during their university experience, when in fact they shouldn&rsquo;t even be there because they are not qualified for it.  We need to go back to admitting people on the basis of merit only; those who don&rsquo;t qualify can go to trade or vocational schools.</p>

<p>Let me translate this for those who cannot speak &#8220;multiculturalese.&#8221;  What Dr. Yudof is saying is that in the future, a desire to be a rap star or a NBA player will out-weigh a perfect SAT score in terms of college addmitance. </p>
<p>Remember, the purpose of education is NOT to train the brightest among us so that they can continue to advance science,  technology, and culture, but to assure that different races are equally distributed in all professions (except, of course,in sports, where un-equal racial representation is welcomed).  </p>

		<p>Since I am FROM San Diego, grew up there then moved to Louisville KY, the BEST decision I have ever made, I have been following the &ldquo;racist&rdquo; incidents from the start, the &ldquo;Compton Cookout&rdquo; was hosted by a black man and the next week a noose was found  in the library put there by a latina, soon a &#8220;K&#8221; style hood, really a pillow case was found on a statue never found out who put it on but most likely was another &ldquo;oppressed minority&rdquo;</p>

<p>When are white students going to address the regents? When is there going to be a student group for whites at any college of any kind in California? Where whites are shut out of the debate, even as they all work to bring diversity, and in most cases minority special interest groups are considered the definition of diversity, and whites are considered the cause of everyone elses &#8216;oppression&rsquo;? I guess Being marginalized and scapegoated, discriminated against and harassed and physically attacked, I guess that is not as important as Feeling marginalized.</p>

		<p>The only way the education system is going to be placed once again on a competent level in order to graduate more qualified students is to get rid of about 90% of the incompetents now holding teaching positions and replacing them with REAL teachers and professors.</p>
<p>The university administrations and teaching staffs especially have become closed minded bigots who do more harm than good and their teaching abilities are so lackluster the graduates coming into the workforce now care more about social engineering than performing at optimum levels.</p>
<p>This could be why Gates and others prefer to get high tech people from non-PC countries.</p>

<p>hatred and bigotry = reality, sanity, logic</p>
<p>unchallenged = free speech without the threat of physical violence by commie, professor inspired, black thugs</p>
<p>In other words, a diverse group dialoging to an administrator enforced, predetermined consensus, is required to muzzle the thoughts of observant white students.  Absent the diversity, white students tend to embrace their culture more than they would with blacks around.  When the Afrotudes are around whites are forced to pretend blacks are smart and their culture has value.</p>

		<p>I was greeted by this noxious piece today, and hoped AMREN would include it so I might comment. This is not about minorities, it is simply a payoff to blacks, and their fiends, to prevent more outraging on campus.</p>
<p>I recall one Mr. Nguyen, a student, commenting that he thought too much was being made of the whole thing. I believe this reflects the student body consensus, excepting the AA (mulatto and mestizo) kids, and some leftist loons. Maybe this PC swill from UC leadership will spur some of the &#8220;silent majority&#8221; to vote their racial interests, or even speak up.</p>

<p>Is that why whites are being scapegoated with hoax crimes across the UC San Diego campus?</p>
<p>I mean whitey is only 26% of the campus. Who are they going to blame in a decade when that number is like 10%? Or in 20 years when it is 5%? Or in 30 years when it is almost zero?</p>
<p>At some point, the Hispanics, Asians and Middle Easterners are going to tell blacks something like, &#8220;Look, you can blame whitey all you want. But don&rsquo;t try any of that racism with us or we&rsquo;ll give it right back to you.&#8221;</p>

I know this sound far-fetched, science fiction, but I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if we&rsquo;ve been infected by a parasite. If it can happen to ants, why not other animals:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yewbsah" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yewbsah</a></p>
<p>Meet Dicrocoelium, a fellow parasite.</p>
<p>This lancet fluke&rsquo;s lifestyle is a migration through the fluids of three hosts; a cow, a snail and an ant.</p>
<p>Hungry snails eat the dung of the infected cows and swallow inadvertently the sequestered fluke eggs. Once hatching in the snail&rsquo;s intestine, they burrow through the gut wall and into a digestive gland. Within this gland, flukes reproduce a second generation - spewed back into the world by the tormented snail as balls of slime, each sticky drop, a seething mass of flukes.</p>
<p>It is in the third host, the ant host, where we observe mind control. Foraging ants come across the sparkling orbs of snot, sensing the source of moisture that they are, they quench their thirst on the slick beverage. Entering the third hypersea reservoir, the flukes undulate through the ant&rsquo;s fluids, most form cysts in the abdomen, but some home in on the nerve clusters that control the mandibles in the ants head.</p>
<p>The temperature drops into the coolness of evening, and the infected ant feels compelled to leave its brethren, forsaking them to climb a grass stalk spire to its apex - the pastures emergent canopy. Preparing to make itself a sacrifice, it anchors itself to the flimsy blade, attached firmly by its mandibles.</p>
<p>It waits motionless throughout the night to be devoured by the primary host, the cow. Herds like ruminating clouds pass over the ant, blotting out the stars, the hoof falls reminisant of distant thunderclaps. If the ant survives until morning the flukes relinquish their control allowing the ant to scurry back to join its fellow workers in the gloom and away from the solar furnace which would be death to both the host and the backseat driving parasite. By day the ant is a regular Joe indistinguishable from any other ant, but when night falls, again it makes its ascent into &#8216;munch range&rsquo; over and over until eventually consumed, drowned in cud, bursting open as a swarm of flukes within the cows stomach. The flukes complete the cycle by penetrating the bovines liver, becoming adult egg producers.</p>
<p>Flukes embedded inside another organism, use mind control. Though it could be argued not remote control, but the comparison remains at some level similar, implanting electrodes, the closest we can come to crawling inside another animals CNS. At least hopefully so. <br>

		<p>Holistic review to allow blacks into public financed universities, and then Grade Inflation so blacks can graduate with their general studies and afro-history degrees. With the degree they then get government jobs and are set for life. Very expensive welfare.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Republicans and Libertarians only argue the welfare part   &mdash;   as if the blacks could survive in a competitive market economy. </p>
<p>I wish we had our own university like the religious right has (www.liberty.edu - they even have a law school). I think trying to build a university is better than a think tank. Universities are better for networking and building future intellectuals and professionals.</p>

<p>When I have ridden through the campus, I saw only Asian faces. Maybe that&rsquo;s just a conincidence.  But &#8220;Caucasians&#8221; are only 26%. Who&rsquo;s the so-called &#8220;minority&#8221; there? </p>
<p>And who is the presumed &#8220;majority&#8221; that is, by implication, being criticized as selfish and insensitive? The guilty group that &#8220;frees hatred and bigotry&#8221; and allows them to flourish and &#8220;go unchallenged&#8221;? I wonder who that could be.</p>
<p>I also have to wonder how (for example) Arabs are categorized. Are they listed as Caucasian?  And others? Apparently.<br>
If Caucasians comprise only 26% of the whole, I&rsquo;ll bet that <i>&#8216;white, native-born, Christian Americans&rsquo;</i> don&rsquo;t amount to more than even half of that, giving them 13% (at best). And of those, how many are males??? Surely hot even 6.5%  Hardly any!</p>
<p>If any &#8220;minorities&#8221; should be complaining about being under-represented and shut out, it is  <i>white Christian native-born males.</i> We are the decided minority.</p>
<p>And this, in the country that we founded and built! Simply amazing.</p>

		<p>It just don&rsquo;t get no goofier than this. Kind of reminds us of those utterly ridiculous TV commercials we&rsquo;re constantly bombarded with. Some older White men on a fishing/camping trip. The obligatory Black &#8220;best friend&#8221; along for diversity. Two White females with the mandator Black female also their &#8220;best friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder just how many, or rather how few actually   &mdash;   Whites can honestly claim to have Blacks as their closest friends. I&rsquo;d venture to guess that other then liberal fools going through their little charades, damned few Whites really have Blacks as their &#8220;best&#8221; friends. Sure, you work with them on a daily basis&hellip; But after work, on weekends&hellip; everyone heads off in separate directions. Visiting each other&rsquo;s homes, spending quality time together? I doubt that real life is even REMOTELY like those oh, so ridiculous TV sitcom commercials. I mean, why would we want them as our &#8220;closest friends&#8221; to begin with? We have almost nothing in common with them.</p>

		<p>How could any sensible person not mock an institution like the collective federal, state, and local government and public schools and universities that, in the name of racial equality, enact racial favoritism towards non-whites any chance they get and for any reason?  In India, they have sacred cows who roam the streets while people starve to death.  In the US, we have infantilized blacks with two digit IQs being ushered through public universities, getting fake degrees of no value from departments that have zero scientific, engineering, nor research integrity while applications from superiorly qualified whites and asians get rejected.   All this is done for one reason only: to manufacture more generations of brainwashed voters for the democrat party at the expense of having fewer and fewer US born engineers, scientists, doctors, and nurses.    The democrats are Detroitifying the entire country.   This place will be mostly a broken down wasteland in 50 years if this catering to brown skinned racism continues indefinitely.    </p>

		<p>Since Asians and Latinos collectively make up over 60% of the student body, and whites are now a minority and getting smaller yearly, then I guess this means that Asians will have to be excluded to bring in more black students.  Let&rsquo;s see how that flies.</p>
<p>One thing whites need to understand is that Asians have no time for affirmative action, cries of poverty, etc&hellip; and they will push back.  They may be our best secret weapon.</p>

		<p>In despair and frustration, I can only laugh at all this.<br>
What the universities, and education in general, have come to (or descended to) transcends belief. </p>
<p>I think of my old history and social studies teacher in high school, back in the 50s. She was a grad.of the Univ. of Colorado, and thus was  a firey liberal   &mdash;   for those days, that is. (I&rsquo;m talking the McCarthy era.) Everything is relative, though. The funny thing is that by today&rsquo;s standards, she would be considered a hardbound &#8220;conservative&#8221;, about  as extreme right as you could get. Even todays &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; are lefties compared to her back then.  She probably would have regarded Bush as a communist.  LOL. I never saw her again. She wasn&rsquo;t really that much of a lefty after all.  I wonder what she thought of the leftward swing of the country in the 60&rsquo;s&hellip;hippies, Woodstock, &#8220;freedom riders&#8221;, riots, and all that.  She probably was amused at first, then baffled, and then absolutely horrified.   &mdash;   Poor woman, she never would have believed what&rsquo;s going on today!</p>
<p>That shows how far to the left we&rsquo;ve come. Sometimes our dreams turn out to be nightmares.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;One thing whites need to understand is that Asians have no time for affirmative action, cries of poverty, etc&hellip; and they will push back. They may be our best secret weapon&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Asians are already forming groups to advocate and stand up for their people.  They well understand the power of group advocacy, as does the government, which is why it is not allowed for Whites.</p>
<p>DH is a college counselor and tells me that Asians are being discriminated against far more than White males these days  &mdash;  many of the UCs, according to the admissions officers, are &#8216;over-Asian&rsquo;d&rsquo; and are trying to become &#8216;more diverse.&rsquo;   I imagine if the chips fell where they may, the Asian percentage at the UCs would be even higher than 46%, the black and hispanic percentage much lower.</p>
<p>Prop 209 has helped but the UCs twist themselves into knots to get around its requirement of race neutrality in admissions, implementing the idiocy of &#8216;holistic&rsquo; grading which weighs and gives academic merit to such life experiences  as getting shot, growing up in foster care, having a father on death row over earned academic achievement.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, last year I saw my daughter&rsquo;s Asian friends, with such outstanding academic achievements as near-perfect SAT I and II scores, 5&rsquo;s on the toughest AP exams, GPAs over 4.25, denied entrance to the best UCs  &mdash;  UCLA and Berkeley and instead offered admission to second- and third-tier Riverside, Santa Cruz or Merced. </p>
<p>Hopefully, our Legal friends at PLF (Pacific Legal Foundation), who are fighting race-based UC admissions, will nullify this latest end-run around Prop 209.</p>
<p>They report:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In an effort to determine whether UCLA is obeying the state Constitution&rsquo;s ban on race- and sex-based discrimination and preferences in undergraduate admissions, Pacific Legal Foundation today submitted a California Public Records Act request for relevant documents from UCLA&rsquo;s applications process.</p>
<p>PLF has been contacted by a number of students, parents, and UC faculty who suspect that undergraduate admissions at UCLA are not race- and sex-neutral, as required by Proposition 209 </p>
<p>Among the documents sought by PLF&rsquo;s Public Records Act Request:</p>
<p>*Undergraduate applications, including essays – with all personal identifying information redacted – from applicants to the classes of 2005 through 2008.</p>
<p>*The identities of all applications readers, the scores they gave each application, and documents revealing why they decided to admit or reject each candidate. </p>
<p>*All handbooks and other documents designed to guide application readers.</p>
<p>UCLA asks for personal essays, which by definition have to be graded somewhat subjectively.  We&rsquo;re asking for these essays – and evidence of how they&rsquo;re scored and weighted – to make sure that admissions officials aren&rsquo;t using these subjective evaluations as a way to bias the process in violation of Proposition 209&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/kjltbz</p>
<p>This request was filed in October of 2008 and there is no follow up (as of yet) on PLF&rsquo;s site.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But [Regent Eddie Island] blamed UC&rsquo;s admissions policies for artificially limiting the rolls of minority students. &ldquo;It is the absence of inclusion that frees hatred, that frees bigotry, that allows it to go unchallenged. That&rsquo;s our biggest problem,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Regent&rsquo;s answer to test results which don&rsquo;t support his enforcement of race mixing is to invent special preference scoring for minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yudof said he wanted all UC campuses to adopt &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; review, in which [admission] applicants&rsquo; test scores and high school grades are considered in the context of their life experiences and personal accomplishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regent Yudof&rsquo;s answer to test results which don&rsquo;t support his enforcement of race mixing is also to invent special preference scoring for minorities.<br>
  <br>
Both of these Regents have long since decided that minority attendance statistics in their educational institutions trump educational standards or the quality of achievement of their graduates. Thus, these Regents are traitors to their responsibility to the worth of the institution they represent. </p>

		<p>Gen Lee:</p>
<p>Read my post again.</p>
<p>You COMPLETELY misunderstood what I wrote.</p>
<p>I am neither insensitive nor are my comments flawed and I resent your accusations.</p>
<p>My point is, and as PLF is investigating, that such &#8216;life experiences&rsquo; as getting shot, growing up in foster care, not having a father TRUMP academic achievements such as perfect SAT scores, 5&rsquo;s on the toughest AP exams and GPAs of 4.25 and above.</p>
<p>Tell me, General, is that fair to you?</p>
<p>So a kid that&rsquo;s had a &#8216;tough row to hoe&rsquo; in life with FAR INFERIOR academic achievements is admitted over an Asian or White kid who sacrificed his life, worked hard, focused on academics, buckled down, paid attention in class and pored over books.</p>
<p>Does this seem fair to you?</p>
<p>I know this because I&rsquo;ve worked in high schools for the past 20+ years and have watched as non-White students with FAR Lesser Qualifications, FAR Lower Class rankings, FAR Lower Test Scores but who have &#8216;triumphed over life&rsquo; (as they&rsquo;ve written in their sob-story essays) are fawned over, paid personal visits by top-notch university admissions officers, flow in to major universities for personal tours, offered full scholarships that include living and travel expenses.</p>
<p>Is this fair to you?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, top Asian and White students receive rejection after rejection after rejection from university after university. </p>
<p>My daughter told me the salutatorian in the class before hers (Asian) was rejected by every ivy league university.  He was so crushed he couldn&rsquo;t go to school for two weeks.<br>
 <br>
The valedictorian of my daughter&rsquo;s class (White male) with perfect SAT scores was rejected by EVERY ivy league institution AND Stanford  &mdash;  and we live in California. I could tell by his demeanor that he was crushed although he tried to suck it up.</p>
<p>What would you tell him about non-Whites with FAR lower rankings who were picked up by Stanford with full scholarships (because they&rsquo;d had a hard life)?</p>
<p>My daughter, last year&rsquo;s salutatorian, was rejected by every ivy league school she applied to  &mdash;  she received 5&rsquo;s on every AP except for calculus BC on which she received a 4.  She also won the science, English and foreign language award at her school (voted by the school faculty).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, non-Whites far below all of them in ranking were picked up by Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Harvard  &mdash;  and given scholarships to attend these top universities.</p>
<p>How is that fair?  </p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t there when my daughter received the rejections  &mdash;  but I was and it was horrible.  A year later she is still hurt by the unfairness of it all, at scholarships and accolades showered on those with far inferior qualifications.  She received no recognition or accolades from anywhere. </p>
<p>She asked me what the point was of working so hard in school only to be rejected by the top universities  &mdash;  the same universities that accepted lesser-qualified non-Whites.</p>
<p>What would YOU tell these students?  </p>
<p>Because a non-White with far inferior qualifications, who might have been shot or had a tough life, should TRUMP those with superior qualifications?</p>
<p>How in ANY WAY is that fair?</p>
<p>Which do you think has a better shot of success at a top-notch university, the &#8216;holistically&rsquo; admitted non-White student with &#8216;life and/or personal achievements&rsquo; (at 18?) or the student with perfect or near-perfect SAT scores, GPAs over 4.25 and 5&rsquo;s on AP tests?</p>
<p>Would you bet on the &#8216;holistically&rsquo; admitted student?  According to the admissions committee at the UCs, this student SHOULD BE &#8216;given a chance&rsquo; (and remember, college admissions is a zero sum game  &mdash;  that &#8216;holistic&rsquo; student pushes aside a more qualified candidate. </p>
<p>THIS is what PLF, with good reason, is investigating  &mdash;  why non-White &#8216;sob stories&rsquo; TRUMP  superior White and Asian academic qualifications.</p>
<p>Bottom line:  This is to DENY Whites from receiving degrees and credentials from top universities in order to lower their status.</p>
<p>Do you now understand what I wrote in my previous post?</p>

<p>If the experience does indeed confer &#8220;academic merit&#8221;, then students should all go out and seek to get shot in order to become better scholars.  Sheer nonsense, obviously!</p>

		<p>Bon: You wasted a lot of time and keystrokes trying to explain to me something that I already understand:  Whites with superior academic credentials are unfairly discriminated against in college admissions and on many other levels.  At no point in time did I take issue with that part your initial post, yet you spend almost all of post #32 trying to explain something to me that I never misunderstood.  What I did take issue with was part of the smaller section that follows..</p>
<p>Bon #27:&#8221; Prop 209 has helped but the UCs twist themselves into knots to get around its requirement of race neutrality in admissions, implementing the idiocy of &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; grading which weighs and gives academic merit to such life experiences as getting shot, growing up in foster care, having a father on death row over earned academic achievement. Ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>There you are insinuating, if not outright saying that it is &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; that getting shot (among other things) should factor, or &#8220;weigh&#8221; into a students academic credentials.  I am saying you are wrong IN THAT STATEMENT ALONE.  Having been shot at the beginning of my Junior year of undergraduate studies, I can say with complete certainty that the subsequent 2 years at college were, for me, an extremely difficult time.  I imagine that people of all races who were victimized by non-fatal gunshot wounds at some point in time (including High School) went through similar traumatic experiences in the aftermath (especially immediate aftermath) of being wounded.  Do you take issue with this or question the legitimacy of my claim?</p>
<p>I do not like to make excuses, as that gets one nowhere in life, but I only hope you understand how mentally traumatizing an event such as getting shot can be, and how it can negatively effect one&rsquo;s performance in life generally, and academics more specifically.  Your initial post seemed to indicate some trouble in understanding that.</p>

		<p>I have had a hard life too, and I never attended college (scholarship or none), or even graduated high school. So I have no personal experience with this, or any ax to grind. From the age of 17 i have had to work and support myself. I do not gripe about it. I have also been the victim of many crimes, and of frequent discrimination in the workplace. I have been almost killed several times. I don&rsquo;t cry on anybody&rsquo;s shoulder about that either. I very rarely even talk about it, because few people would understand (unless they&rsquo;ve been through the same). If you complain about black crime or discrimination, many whites are unsympathetic and will accuse you of being prejudiced. You&rsquo;re supposed to tolerate the behavior of other races and not criticize them. So I don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think iit is possible for anybody to evaluate another&rsquo;s &#8220;life experience&#8221;.  Only you know what you&rsquo;ve been through. Nobody else can. (Nor is it their business. As I said, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell them about it.)  And why should that count for college admission anyway?  These things are apples and oranges. The only thing that should matter (in school) is academic performance. Schools should be neutral otherwise - &#8220;level playing fields&#8221; as they say. Social engineering and racial schemes should not apply. If you can do the work, fine. If you can&rsquo;t handle it, you shouldn&rsquo;t be there. Just my opinion.</p>

		<p>Might I add to clarify, Bon, that what you said it post 32 differs a bit from what you said in 27.</p>
<p>Namely:</p>
<p>#32 &#8220;My point is, and as PLF is investigating, that such &lsquo;life experiences&rsquo; as getting shot, growing up in foster care, not having a father TRUMP academic achievements such as perfect SAT scores, 5&rsquo;s on the toughest AP exams and GPAs of 4.25 and above.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you here.  The key being your use of the word &#8220;trump&#8221; which was not used at all in post 27 (nor was a similar word).  Those life experiences should not even come close to TRUMPing any academic achievements such as SATs, APs, GPAs.  </p>
<p>However, in your initial post (27) you called it ridiculous that said &#8216;life experiences&rsquo; should even &#8220;weigh&#8221; into the equation.  Life experiences &#8220;weighing&#8221; in college admissions on the one hand, is quite different from Life experiences &#8220;trumping academic achievements&#8221; in college admissions, on the other.</p>

My point is simple:  While one should not gain any additional academic merit for being shot, there is no reason to completely disregard it in an assessment of one&rsquo;s overall academic performance and life circumstances.  </p>

<p>Liberal and well off whites, with college degrees, good jobs, and high incomes, who have not had to live and work among ghetto blacks, refuse to believe that blacks are not the wonderful, wise, persecuted people they learned about in sociology class. (I&rsquo;ll grant, some are.)  Why couldn&rsquo;t you &#8220;just get along&#8221; with them? Whatever happened to you must be your fault. </p>
<p>If you tell them about your unfortunate experiences, they don&rsquo;t like to hear that kind of thing because it makes them uncomfortable and it conflicts with their preconceptions. You run into a wall of scepticism, sometimes outright hostility. They believe that you are lying, or exaggerating, or else that you are simply a racist bigot who got what served you right.  There is always the belief that somehow you deserved it. They can&rsquo;t believe this terrible thing could happen to just anybody. At worst, it was just a freak event that was not racial. Furthermore, they have no identification with working class people.  Thus you get no sympathy.   So it&rsquo;s best not to talk, at least not to well off white liberals.<br>

		<p>Life experiences have always been weighed in college admissions.  The kid with mediocre grades but an immaculate self-built hot rod admitted to the engineering school, or the girl with a B average who raises her four younger siblings for her ailing, widowed mother, these kinds of demonstrations of creativity or determination have long been valued by any intelligent dean.  But now the move is to institutionalize these judgements, in order to admit more incompetent Blacks and Hispanics.  The sob story essay has become a standard tactic to evade the law and cheat more Whites out of their country.  All a non-White has to do is cry about &#8220;racism&#8221;, and their work is done. <br>
      I once asked an Oriental girl about all the examples of &#8220;racism&#8221; she cited, wondering just who had said or done these things.  Grudgingly, she admitted that in every case, it was a Mexican who had insulted her.  In truth, having to live among Mexicans or Blacks is a life experience that should count in favor of a White being admitted if anything does.  </p>

<p>Should not the admission process be &#8216;race neutral&rsquo; and objective as per the tenants of Prop 209?

<p>Otherwise, as Bon stated, if the chips fell where they may, asians would make up far more than 46 percent of the UC system&rsquo;s racial makeup and whites would be higher than the current 26 percent.  Whites and Asians are being passed over and shunted aside for lesser qualified blacks and hispanics.

I can understand that. I had a Mexican friend, some 20 years ago, who bitterly resented the Chinese coming into this country. He was very prejudiced and make no secret about it. Unlike Americans, he was nasty to them at every chance he got.  Oddly, he never considered that he had come into this country as an immigrant too.</p>
