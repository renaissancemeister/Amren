<h1><a href="https://www.rep-am.com/news/local/471080.txt">Torrington Police on Alert for Gang Activity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Litten, Republican-American (Waterbury, Connecticut), March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police were put on alert Sunday after two men told authorities that a New York street gang had threatened to come to the city early Sunday morning and &#8220;kill any white guys they see walking on the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police were told as many as 50 gang members were headed to Torrington with machetes and planned to launch their attack in the area of East Main and Maud streets, near the city&rsquo;s downtown. The threats, which were not carried out, apparently came in response to a series of fights over the last few months between two groups in an ongoing conflict that police Lt. Mike Emanuel said may have originated at Torrington High School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Emanuel also confirmed that a fight Thursday at the city skate park was one of several that led up to the threats reported to police early Sunday morning. He said police are close to bringing charges against some of the people involved in the fights.</p>

		<p>Many factions across the nation have been warning that Blacks and Tans would do this to whites and the police will look the other way.  Police do not want to get involved and fear the loss of their jobs if they dare to arrest Black Gang members.  Whites must begin to wall off their communities and shut gates at night or be prepared to die.  The Blacks now only elect politicians pledged to take guns away form whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gang activity,&#8221; my eye.  These are no more than a loose affiliation of like-minded, non-white racists that can be found among both Hispanics and blacks anywhere in America.  </p>
<p>While they hate each other based on race, all of them despise whites, due to jealousy at being unable to compete in the white man&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>And as if it weren&rsquo;t bad enough having them here to create an environment of hate against whites, the big brother federales want to bring in more, allegedly as taxpayers to help make up for all the funds they&rsquo;ve stolen for the last fifty years.</p>

		<p>My solution to most of these problems with gangs within our borders is to send in our homegrown and home-sponsored freedom fighters   &mdash;   the United States Marine Corps, the finest fighting force in the world.  They would take care of gang problems in the inner cities and elsewhere in record time, IF we allowed them to use the same tactics that they would use in a foreign battlefield.  Yup, it&rsquo;s brutal, but that IS what&rsquo;s called for with the gang issue.  Gangbangers are among the most vicious fighters on the earth, and they deserve to be met by the best we can offer.</p>

		<p>How can this be? Conn. is way way way above the Masons and Dixons Line, below which are found the Southern racists.  How can blacks in the North do anything but love and adore the yankees who freed them from the evil White Master&rsquo;s plantation?</p>
<p><br>
Blacks hating Whites up North?  Seems impossible.  The good news is that these racially motivated attacks will teach the yankees what Southerners have always known.</p>

		<p>come on now, hispanics are not THAT bad. This whole notion that blacks and hispanics are united against whites is for the most part a fantasy. If anything from what ive seen, hispanics despise blacks, even more so than (some) whites. Really I relish the thought of hispanics becoming the minority majority in this country, if white people will not regulate black people, believe you me, hispanics will. Ideally there would not be a minority majority at all, but a minority majority of hispanics is spades more palatable than a black minority majority. I think many here would agree</p>

If the races had been reversed, the Imperial governmedia would be in overdrive warning us about the dangers of Evil White Racism, Big Chief Obongo would call a press conference (with Nancy Pelosi weeping in the background) and the SPLC would be up all night issuing dire bulletins about &#8220;White Supremacists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With all due respect, folks, these (Trinitario gang members) are considered more to be Hispanics than Blacks proper. That is, they are Dominicans from the Dominican Republic. I&rsquo;m not sure if you want to refer to Dominicans as Blacks, but that&rsquo;s not exactly what I think of when I think Black gangs - i.e., Crips and Bloods. Black gangs don&rsquo;t use machetes.</p>
<p>Letting all of these Dominicans in here was a catastrophe. Most of them came as illegals, often pretending to be Puerto Ricans, another gigantic mistake of an immigrant group. I understand that parts of NYC such as Washington Heights (?) have been taken over by Dominicans and essentially destroyed.</p>

		<p>I had a close relative who lived in Torrington back in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s. I spent a few weeks there one summer - it was just another American town, clean, crime-free, peaceful, and white as cream-cheese! </p>
<p>Oh, what we have done to this country and to ourselves. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is not a strength, it is a CANCER - a malignant, agressive disease to its very core! </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I must disagree with you on this idea.  They have beat us where it counts; politically, culturally, and in population.  But once the fighting begins, that will probably be remedied, because I think far many more white men are prepared where it counts than others.</p>

		<p>Torrington and Danbury Connecticut were wonderful places to live. They were also relatively far from either NYC or Boston so they were mostly white middle class . Danbury in the late 1980s was voted the most livable city in the entire country. I worked there at the time and was a wonderful place. Torrington was considered too far from any big city and therefore a very good place to live if someone didn&rsquo;t mind being at least 2 hours from NYC or Boston. However, like a cancer the ethnic groups who are usually associated with gangs living in place like Hartford CT which was totally ruined or Springfield MASS also ruined, needed &#8220;healthy&#8221; areas to feed on. The only way to stop this growing cancer is to reestablish the right of free association. I mean the government first has to stop prosecuting efforts by whites to keep their community all white if they choose. I know this is very very very unlikely . At least, for now,they haven&rsquo;t taken away the right to wishful daydreaming.</p>

<p>No matter where you go the black man wants to kill and if his target is unarmed he prefers to hack them with machetes.In Africa,Haiti, now America. You cant just kill them it has to be (die hard) or in a dramatic blood soaked way.Look at all the gang attacks and gang rapes we know about, there is always torture.It is beacause they are seething with hate because we remind them everyday of their inferiority by our just living our daily lives.</p>

		<p>Some years ago when I was scouting places to go live to get out of Queens one of the places I went was Torrington. Now I had remembered the area from when I would take my folks up to Catholic retreat up in Litchfield. A beautiful locale. When I passed through Torrington (around 2004) I saw a small but no doubt growing population of hispanics at one end of town. When I passed through Winsted (birthplace of the rat Nader) I talked to a white guy who pumped my gas who told me the place was &#8220;changing&#8221;, that some blacks were moving in. Quiet little Winsted. Then I went on the Torrington website and there was a caption &#8220;Life just got better!&#8221; and a glowing description of &#8220;multicultural&#8221; Torrington with a picture of a smiling asian lady. Just about sums it up. This can&rsquo;t possibly go on for much longer without something big jumping off.</p>

		<p>Maybe OT:<br>
I have seen on youtube a snip of a BBC-Report on Zimbabwe in which the reporter says: &#8220;Some conservatives thought it would a mistake to have a black administration and there will be blood, but today we can see it was not true. The people are living together in harmony.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we today look at such reports, we can only see the mistake.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I must disagree with YOU!  I understood exactly what ranger was talking about.  While they have us beaten politically and in terms of population, they are vastly different to us culturally, and don&rsquo;t kid yourself&hellip;THEY KNOW IT!  All but the most retarded blacks and mestizos have to be at least subconsciously aware of this fact, even if they&rsquo;ll never admit it (due to pride).</p>
<p>What scientific, engineering or artistic feats ever done by blacks and mestizos can hold a candle to all that done by those of the Caucasian persuasion?  Their silly arguments of &#8220;White racism&#8221; and &#8220;poverty&#8221; quickly lose steam when one realizes that White-black IQ differences have remained virtually unchanged, even after 50 years of &#8220;Brown v. Board of Education&#8221;, &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221; and court-ordered busing.  </p>
<p>In a sick, twisted sort of way, we are swiftly becoming like the uninfected humans in Richard Matheson&rsquo;s novel (not the god-awful Will Smith movie) &#8220;I Am Legend&#8221; .  Whereas in times past we were the norm and &#8220;they&#8221; were the deviants, now the roles have been reversed and we must be destroyed to insure their survival and legitimacy.</p>

		<p>Horace, whites up north are indeed no less &#8220;racist&#8221; than we southerners. (I&rsquo;m a metro Atlantan). Blacks, however, do not care how &#8220;liberal&#8221; a white person is. If you go near the wrong ones, you&rsquo;re in danger, and they don&rsquo;t give a hoot if you support affirmative action and contribute to the NAACP. </p>

		<p>I totally agree wtih ROB! Prepare! Prepare! Prepare! that means physically, mentally, and  materially. There are numerous &#8220;schools&#8221; around which can train a person to be effective with various types of firearms. And like the man said, &#8220;don&rsquo;t take a knife (read machete)  to a gunfight. While I love the US Marines, having worked closely with them in various parts of the world, to use them to take care of local gang issues is problematic politically. Local men need to organize and, as I said earlier, prepare! The writing is on the wall (graffiti).</p>
