<h1>Insurgent Video Shows Toronto Student</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Broadcasting Centre, March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CBC News has confirmed the identity of a Toronto man  &mdash;  believed to have joined an al-Qaeda-linked group in Somalia and killed in battle  &mdash;  on an insurgent group&rsquo;s online video.</p>
<p>Mohammed Elmi Ibrahim, an English major at the University of Toronto, can be seen on the two-minute nine-second video made in Saudi Arabia. He is shown discussing the historical significance of his location.</p>
<p>According to a message that accompanies the video found on the al-Shabab website, Ibrahim was killed in battle, although his death has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s unfortunate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his family has high expectations for him  &mdash;  and the Canadian society,&#8221; said Omar Kiresh, president of the mosque that Ibrahim attended.&#8221; So I think it&rsquo;s a loss for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The message with the video is addressed to Canadian youth and says: &#8220;Dont be sadden [sic] but rather rejoice in the news of your dear brother and follow his footsteps and march forth in the ranks of the honest mujahideen, al Shabaab mujahideen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ibrahim, who went by the nickname &#8220;Canlish&#8221; and was in his early 20s, disappeared about 18 months ago and is believed to have joined the Somalian insurgent group al-Shabab. The group was recently added to the Canadian government&rsquo;s terrorist list.</p>
<p>The designation came as members of the Somalian-Canadian community reported that the group is trying to radicalize and recruit young Canadians.</p>
<p>Ibrahim, born and raised in Toronto, had gone with a group to make the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca known as hajj. But he did not return with the group, and that&rsquo;s when his family and intelligence agents in Canada concluded he had gone to fight with al-Shabab.</p>
<p>At least five other young Canadians, who all belonged to the same mosque as Ibrahim and have not been seen since last September, are also believed to have joined al-Shabab.<br>

		<p>The saying &#8220;We&rsquo;re fighting them over there so we won&rsquo;t have to fight them over here&#8221;, is only a near-term half-truth. By importing people who hate us as well as those with a culture opposed to ours, we guarantee we&rsquo;ll be fighting them here in the future, and not just with court cases. </p>

		<p>So lying Omar downplays the role he and his mosque played in radicalizing good ole boy Canlish, and the four or five OTHER missing guys from his mosque, eh?  Right.<br>
Any mosque that has that number of guys go missing and into the jihad network should be shut down and/or expelled.  Even better, why do we need ANY of them within our culture?  Blacks OR muslims?  Nothing but trouble.  We all have our own home grown trouble, why import any more.  Insanity to let it continue.</p>

<p>I remember a simpler time of French-Canadians and English-Canadians fussing over language, the Queen and independence.  They traded the Royal Canadian Air Force for joy of having Somali-Canadians, Paki-Canadians, Haitian-Canadians, Chinese-British Columbians (BC has split off, hasn&rsquo;t it?) and all the other wonders of multicultism.  Can you spell disintegrate?</p>

<p>-&gt;The term &#8220;Canadian&#8221; seems to be very inclusive in these days&hellip; I hope Quebec will become independent and leave all multi-something, insane English-speaking part.</p>

		<p>And the guy was born here.  So much for the second generation types  &#8220;integrating&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m disgusted by what&rsquo;s happening to my country.  The problem is, where can real Canadians go, once recolonization is finished?</p>
