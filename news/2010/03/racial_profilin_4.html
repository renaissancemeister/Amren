<h1>Racial Profiling: Fact or Fiction?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glenn Smith, Post and Courier (Charleston), March 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>North Charleston police have pulled over black drivers at a disproportionate rate over the past two years, with black men twice as likely to be stopped as their white counterparts, police statistics show.</p>
<p>Blacks make up about 49 percent of the city&rsquo;s population but accounted for 65 percent of traffic stops that don&rsquo;t result in a ticket or arrest, records show. That translates to some 25,000 traffic stops involving blacks. Some critics of the police department suspect that these ticketless stops are indicators of harassment or racial profiling.</p>
<p>Police officials insist it&rsquo;s a reflection of a strategic, zero-tolerance crackdown on crime in several troubled neighborhoods where the population is predominantly black and where blacks commit the majority of crimes.</p>
<p>This approach has paid off with a more than 30 percent drop in violent crime over three years, North Charleston Police Chief Jon Zumalt said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some civil rights leaders, however, find the numbers disturbing.</p>
<p>Taylor-Williams&rsquo; mother is Dot Scott, president of the Charleston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Scott, a North Charleston resident, said her organization regularly receives complaints from black motorists who say they have been stopped by North Charleston police for no good reason.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Proven anti-crime tactic</b></p>
<p>Zumalt denied that his officers are infringing on people&rsquo;s rights or targeting people based on race. Instead, police are using a proven tactic of cracking down on even tiny violations, such as broken tail lights, to create an environment where crime can&rsquo;t take root and prosper.</p>
<p>Boosting traffic stops and saturating high-crime areas with officers is part of the strategy police adopted to curtail retaliatory violence that fueled a total of 55 killings in 2006 and 2007, Zumalt said. Last year, the number of killings dropped to 11.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [police] recently launched a &#8220;Sell the Stop&#8221; program requiring officers to identify themselves, explain what&rsquo;s going on and why the stop is necessary, he said.</p>
<p>Zumalt said he will not tolerate people of any color being pulled over for no reason, but he has seen no evidence that that is occurring. The police department has received three complaints since 2007 about alleged racial bias by officers and, in each case, the officers were cleared, records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mary Ward, president of the North Charleston branch of the NAACP, said she isn&rsquo;t sure where the complaints are coming from or why they&rsquo;re going to Scott. Though she has cautioned police against using racial profiling, Ward said she has received no calls on this subject in over a year.</p>
<p><b>A hostile climate?</b></p>
<p>North Charleston police conducted nearly 61,000 traffic stops last year, double the stops recorded during violence-marred 2006. Police have no information on the race of those involved in traffic stops that led to arrests or tickets, as the department has no mechanism in place to track that data, Zumalt said.</p>
<p>Stops that led to no citations or arrests are tracked because state law requires police agencies to fill out forms on these encounters as a check on racial profiling.</p>
<p>The state data, as a whole, show police in South Carolina stopping black motorists at a rate that roughly reflects their percentage of the population. That is generally true for the communities surrounding North Charleston as well.</p>
<p>In Charleston, for example, blacks make up about 30 percent of the population and 35 percent of some 27,000 traffic stops in that city over the past two years, state records show.</p>
<p>The Rev. Joe Darby, vice president of the Charleston NAACP, said statistics prove there is racial profiling in North Charleston, which long has caused many blacks to steer clear of the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>North Charleston police arrested about 3,700 people for disorderly conduct over the past two years, and around 67 percent of those cases resulted in guilty pleas or verdicts, according to municipal court records.</p>
<p>The court records do not include the race of those arrested, and police said they do not track that information.</p>
<p><b>Complaints to NAACP</b></p>
<p>Scott provided The Post and Courier with information from 10 complaints lodged with the Charleston NAACP about North Charleston police in the past year, including one regarding a confrontation she had with officers while trying to evict two tenants from a rental property.</p>
<p>The complaints range from racial profiling allegations and contested drug charges to a dispute over a ticket that a woman received for having a child not properly restrained in a car.</p>
<p>Half of those who complained about police harassment had previous criminal records, including three with multiple arrests for drugs or violent crimes, state records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Numbers sow concern</b></p>
<p>The NAACP isn&rsquo;t the only group to raise concerns about profiling. Participants at a diversity training session for new officers in November complained that some officers seem to use any excuse to stop young black men.</p>
<p>The Rev. Augustus D. Robinson Jr., pastor of Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, told the group that one man in his church had been pulled over 14 times in North Charleston. His church even shows an instructional film to young people to teach them how to act during a traffic stop to avoid a confrontation with police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The first question I would ask is: If you pulled all of these people over and it did not result in a ticket, why did you stop them?&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is the key.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police have stopped people for myriad violations as part of a &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; approach to problems in troubled neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s a strategy that proved effective in driving down crime in New York City, Los Angeles and other cities.</p>
<p>Zumalt said many of the stops didn&rsquo;t result in tickets or arrests because officers chose instead to give people a break with warnings. He said officers issued warnings for about 40 percent of the violations found in traffic stops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police officials also are watching to make sure officers are treating people appropriately, auditing records of stops, reviewing in-car videos and conducting customer-service surveys with citizens who encounter police, he said.</p>

		<p>First off, it is very hard for a cop to tell the race of any of the people inside the car, especially if the car has those tinted windows that blacks seem to like so much.</p>
<p>The other problem is that racial profiling isn&rsquo;t the only kind of profiling.  There is also age and gender profiling:  Young people are more likely to be pulled over and are subject to more scrutiny than really old people over 40, and men more likely than women.  There are no serious charges of ageism or sexism leveled in these situations, but there are when race seems to be used.</p>

<p>That is really what is happening.  They are more likely to give a break to the black motorist, most likely due to political pressure from politicians and police chiefs.  </p>

<p>This is irrelevant to most blacks. What is relevant is that more blacks are being stopped than Whites. This is intolerable to blacks. The solution?? Quit stopping more blacks than Whites. The black crime rate will skyrocket, with plenty more blacks being raped, robbed and murdered. This will be acceptable to blacks. Just DONT stop more blacks than Whites.  </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, the cops are in a no-win situation by keeping these racial statistics. If a minority driver is let off with no arrest or ticket, then it&rsquo;s &#8220;See, we are being stopped by no reason.&#8221; But if the same driver is arrested or ticketed, it&rsquo;s &#8220;See, we are suffering selective enforcement.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;really old people over 40&hellip;.&#8221;  Wow.  Thanks for that one :)</p>
<p>A Charleston area blogger and police officer has a post up that sums up the situation rather nicely:</p>
<p>https://lowcountrycrime.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/and-they-trot-out-the-racial-profiling-line-again/</p>
<p>As another poster said - cops can&rsquo;t win.  Unfortunately, South Carolina requires them to keep these stats by issuing warning citations.  On the copy the officer turns in they also have to answer questions like &#8216;was vehicle searched, was consent given&#8221; etc.  It&rsquo;s ridiculous the way blacks are catered to whenever they cry racism.</p>

<p>Way to go, Reverend. When this hits the police locker room, the cops will decide to cover their butts by writing tickets to all the blacks they stop. Thereby costing them big bucks (a traffic ticket in the Bay Area of the &#8220;People&rsquo;s Demokratik Republik of Kalifornia&#8221; goes for about $400; it&rsquo;s probably not cheap in Charleston, either).</p>

		<p>Funny how the tactic of profiling whites in black neighborhoods as being there for illicit purposes doesn&rsquo;t raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p>Look for the thing out of place&hellip;profiling IS law enforcment.</p>
<p>And to confirm some suspicions, yes the cops treat blacks with kid gloves because they are taught at birth how to say &#8220;raciss&#8221; and where to find the ever present disingenuous white liberal that will validate everything they claim.</p>

<p>They always do. Blacks simply don&rsquo;t measure up to white standards, so when you try to hold them accountable, you always have the typical &#8220;leaders&#8221; hawking about discrimination or some nonsense like that.</p>

		<p>There is a VERY easy solution to this problem (the alleged problem of &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo; of blacks, by white police officers) - absolute freedom of association.</p>
<p>Allow all whites who prefer the company of their own kind, to live in all white states. All whites who WANT to live with blacks, and other non-whites, can do so in other states.</p>
<p>Result: no more allegedly &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites will have any contact or jurisdiction over non-whites, and all &#8216;racism&rsquo; will end.</p>
<p>But this is the last thing the non-whites want&hellip;</p>

		<p>After liberals have spent decades convincing blacks that they are being systematically discriminated against, it&rsquo;s little wonder that many think every unpleasant encounter is racially motivated.  And black advocacy groups want to appear to still have some reason for existence.<br>
The Supreme Court has stated that racial profiling by cops is okay.  Blacks are less likely to be properly insured and to have their vehicles in proper running order (tail lights out, etc.)  They&rsquo;re also liklier, I would guess, to act up when stopped.<br>
Several years ago, an Ohio state cop pulled me over on a rural, two-lane road at night.  When she first got a good look at me, she seemed startled.  I have short hair, was driving a beat-up old pickup, and probably was mistakenly profiled as a (young?) man.  She told me I was weaving over the outside line and she wanted to see if I was sick(!)  I replied, &#8220;Oh, I never drink, ma&rsquo;am!&#8221; She didn&rsquo;t deny actually thinking that and just gave me a very polite warning.  <br>
When it comes to the criminal justice system, many blacks complain, no matter what.  I once saw a program about a serial murder case in the Deep South.  No one suspected a black until an outside DNA expert used scientifically racial profiling.  The cops started looking at blacks, and a man with a long record was ID&rsquo;ed and convicted.  The government itself refused to use the outside method because of the racial implications!  Then, to beat all, a black prosecutor who helped convict the guy stated that he wished such technology would just go away!  <br>
People who think like that really should leave in a separatist society.</p>

That sounds brutal, but what are we supposed to think of people who object to ordinary, sensible, law enforcement, and then turn around and cry when their kids are killed?  I never bother reading about crimes that involve only Blacks.  The newspapers know it too, because Black on Black murders usually only get a paragraph on page 15.  </p>

<p>That just might happen.  I have heard rumors that cops in black-heavy cities are under pressure to arrest more whites for more tickey-tack offenses just to even up their arrest racial stats.  If you are a young white man, and you live in an &#8220;urban&#8221; area, your behavior better be purer than the wind-driven snow and Caesar&rsquo;s wife combined, b/c the cop, needing to fill a racial quota, is going to find any excuse to arrest you and take you off to either juvenile or adult jail, you&rsquo;ll be raped in either case.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care either to be honest.  Blacks hate us, they attack us, so let them self destruct.  Let them kill eachother.  let them have high abortion rates.  Let them snort cocaine and inject heroin into their arms.  Most whites don&rsquo;t care either what they do, as long as they don&rsquo;t blame us for it or make us a part of their culture.  Let the blacks and hispanics engage in this self-destructive behavior.  In the end, we will pick up all the pieces they left behind and reclaim our race and rights.</p>
