<h1>Georgia Considers Outlawing Abortions Based on Race, Gender</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Clark, Fox News, March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Georgia lawmakers are poised to take up a controversial bill that would outlaw abortions prompted by the baby&rsquo;s race or gender, an issue that has inspired a billboard campaign claiming a racial conspiracy is behind the termination of pregnancies.</p>
<p>Are health care providers using abortion to curb the growth of the U.S. black population?</p>
<p>That question will be at heart of a debate among Georgia lawmakers, who are poised to take up a controversial bill that would outlaw abortions prompted by the baby&rsquo;s race or gender.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for the bill, it barely made it out of committee this week, in a 7-6 vote and it still needs to clear the Rules Committee before heading to the full House, but proponents are emboldened by the recent committee vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the bill passes, providers cannot solicit, perform or accept funding for abortions they know are prompted by the baby&rsquo;s race or gender. Providers who are found guilty each would face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000. Pregnant women would not be held liable.</p>
<p>Loudermilk, who acknowledged that enforcement will be difficult, said the bill applies the same standards used for outlawing discrimination in workplace and in schools.</p>
<p>Catherine Davis, director of minority outreach for Georgia Right to Life, the group behind the billboard campaign, told FoxNews.com that she supports the legislation that she says will address an issue that has &#8220;such a disproportionate impact on the black community rather than every other community in Georgia, as well as the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis noted that in 2008, blacks made up 30 percent of the population in Georgia but more than 57 percent of the abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those numbers are so horrific,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There has to be something else contributing to this number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis said one study shows there is a direct correlation between the location of most abortion clinics in urban areas and the number of abortions by black women. In Georgia, she said, 100 percent of the clinics are in urban areas. Nationwide, it&rsquo;s 75 percent, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ross [Loretta Ross, national coordinator of SisterSong, an abortion-rights group] agrees that abortion is having a disproportionate impact on the black community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of health disparities, less access to birth control, less access to sex education,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have a higher rate of childhood sexual abuse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so when you have those types of disparities, you&rsquo;ll have unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Absolutely right!  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;unintelligence&#8221;.  Black women are far more likely than White women to have abortions due to the fact they can&rsquo;t afford them.  If they practiced &#8220;safe sex&#8221;, they wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten pregnant in the first place!</p>
<p>A lot of conservative-types may disagree with me, but I strongly feel abortions for women living below the poverty line should be state-funded.  I hope this bill fails.<br>

		<p> This story&rsquo;s a joke   &mdash;   right?! Since when have black children been an &#8220;endangered species&#8221; in any country? Their birth rate is higher than ours; the government takes care of any whose parents   &mdash;   meaning their momma   &mdash;   are &#8220;too poor&#8221; or too trifling to do so.</p>
<p> If &#8220;most abortion clinics&#8221; are located in black neighborhoods   &mdash;   which I don&rsquo;t believe for a New York minute (what is this mysterious &#8220;study&#8221; that proved the allegation?)   &mdash;   then black women don&rsquo;t have to go and avail themselves of their, uh, SERVICES, to they? If abortion is making black children an &#8220;endangered species&#8221; then why isn&rsquo;t the NAACP picketing and chanting in front of abortion clinics?</p>
<p> If the truth be known, it&rsquo;s we European-Americans who seem to be headed for &#8220;endangered species&#8221; territory, based on recent reports that minorities are destined soon to make up half of the children in this country. Is there NOTHING that someone can&rsquo;t manipulate around into a case for feeling &#8220;sorry&#8221; for blacks, and &#8220;guilty&#8221; about their so-called &#8220;plight&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this law. How can someone prove that an abortion was performed due to the race or gender of the baby? How would such a stupid law survive its first challenge? </p>
<p>Maybe if an Indian or Chinese woman has an abortion and the baby was a girl you could speculate that the gender was a factor, but how could the state prove it?</p>

		<p>Ah, the irresistible force meets the immovable object. Which does the PC establishment value more - a woman&rsquo;s &#8220;right to choose,&#8221; or protecting the minority group that started it all?</p>
<p>Politics aside, I think it would be difficult to prove that any particular abortion was performed due to the child&rsquo;s race or gender, so the whole matter is probably academic anyway.</p>

		<p>I call this &#8220;When Liberal Causes Collide.&#8221;  To liberals, abortion is sacred and women have a right to abort for any reason, at any time, no questions asked.  But oops!  Now too many black babies are being aborted, and some people abort babies just because they&rsquo;re female!  Such dilemmas must make liberal heads explode!  This must be their attempt to have things both ways.</p>

		<p>Reverend Wright rails against the US government for supposedly inventing AIDS to exterminate blacks, but I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a reliable supporter of the political party that has as one of its cornerstones the most overt attempt to check the population of blacks in America - abortion.</p>
<p>Abortion has killed FAR more blacks than HIV/AIDS, and considering their race is a perennial 90+% supporter of Democrat candidates and issues, could we say they&rsquo;ve been complicit? </p>

		<p>Though generally opposed to abortion, the reality is that the black population would be increasing even more rapidly were it not readily available.</p>
<p>A far more effective approach would be widespread application of eugenics to control the birthrates of the less intelligent.</p>

		<p>I always found it funny when they tried to make a connection between high abortion rates and proximity to abortion clinics like some white girl in the suburbs with an unwanted pregnancy is going to say &#8220;Well, I should have an abortion but I don&rsquo;t want to go all the way into the city.  Parking is terrible and I might get robbed.  I think I&rsquo;ll just have the baby&#8221; or on the flip side I don&rsquo;t think that a pregnant black girl is going to see an abortion clinic in her neighborhood and say &#8220;You know, I was planning on having this baby but I think I&rsquo;ll stop in and see what all the fuss is&#8221;.      </p>
<p>The locations of the clinics are a simple matter of supply and demand.   </p>

		<p>Blacks have a higher fertility rate than whites, yet somehow abortion is thinning out the black population?  I wonder if the pro-life community would endorse a billboard aimed directly at white women?  Perhaps it could display a nearly expended hourglass; and underneath, in bold red print over a black background, cite the 2050 estimate that whites will become a minority in America.</p>

		<p>As far as the placement of the clinics, The market dictates the location. A car lot opens where sales can be made. A supermarket does the same. So it only stands to reason why the clinics are in the black hoods. THAT IS WHERE THE SALES ARE!</p>

		<p>So if this goes thru, blacks will then cry that they are being denied services (abortion) specifically because of their race, and thus whitey continues to hold them down in poverty.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the P.C. crowd really begins to collapse into itself.  They are running in circles all trying to &#8220;out-racist&#8221; themselves and in the meantime looking like fools.</p>

		<p>I look at this proposed law in a slightly different light.</p>
<p>We all know that white females (even in Georgia) are having sex with black males and it is unavoidable that pregnancy results. This law would forbid abortion for white women pregnant by black men, simply because the child would be (half) black.</p>
<p>I believe we also know, that many of these interracial pregnancies end in abortion, which this law would prohibit.</p>
<p>Draw your own conclusions whether it would be a good law.<br>

		<p>The only &#8220;abortions prompted by the baby&rsquo;s race or gender&#8221; are when some girl gets knocked up by someone of another race. I see no reason why a need-based fund shouldn&rsquo;t be set up to help poor women of any color. Because it beats the heck out of a coat-hanger which is option 2. This is just pro-lifers looking for an angle. Those people have gone stark-raving mad.</p>

You need to aim this at the 14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds procreating like bunnies. 18 is too late. A simple outline of a female hand (no color, due to  PC laws) clutching a wad of 10 fanned out $100 bills and the come on line of &#8220;Get yours today!&#8221;  would do the trick. As soon as the first one bites, and gets back to tell all her little BFF&rsquo;s about it, you won&rsquo;t be able to get in the door through the throngs in line waiting to get fixed.</p>

If most abortions are peformed on urban minorities, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to provide the service in the urban communities?</p>
<p>If these &#8216;clinics&rsquo; were moved out of the community, blacks and the race hustlers would be complaining that urban women had to go outside their communities to receive this form of &#8216;health care&rsquo;. If any of these &#8216;clinics&rsquo; were closed, another group of people would be screaming that &#8216;racism&rsquo; was the driving force behind denying minority women this &#8216;service&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>70% of black babies are born out of wedlock.<br>
Fatherless children almost always are raised in poverty.<br>
50% of black women have herpes.<br>
Blacks aren&rsquo;t using birth control or practicing safe sex.<br>
These take forethought and planning. <br>
Abortion is a fix after the fact. <br>
The book &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; made the connection between legalized abortion and the fall in crime rates.<br>
59% of abortions are done on blacks, but another Georgia statistic is 50% of the children in foster homes are black. Ban abortions and that statistic will sky-rocket. Blacks aren&rsquo;t providing stable homes and good parenting to the children that are born now - there are many more things horrific about black behavior than their abortion rate!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m confused here. Was told several times during my education that the biggest reason for the disproportionate number of unwed mothers in the &#8220;black community&#8221; is their moral aversion to ending a human life. Guess that&rsquo;s one more thing I&rsquo;ll have to re-think&hellip;</p>
<p>Like some of the other posters, I also have a hard time understanding what is meant by &#8220;abortions based on race.&#8221; The only logical conclusion I can draw from a convoluted statement like this  &mdash;  which would do credit to the Detroit School Board President  &mdash;  is that they want to prevent white women who have been raped by blacks from aborting the unwanted pregnancy.</p>

&#8220;This is just pro-lifers looking for an angle&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head. This is pro-lifers trying to &#8216;play the Left at their own game&rsquo;, and force them into conceding that at least some fetuses have value, in order to shift the ideological ground in the pro-life direction. Of course, the left have long used minorities and victim groups to push their own agenda too. It is rather like during the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the USA fought proxy wars in Latin America and Africa. Now the left and right wings are doing the same thing in a political/ideological sense with the minorities in their own countries. <br>
It is a dangerous tactic which may have unintended consequences that the pro-lifers did not envisage.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a little confused myself but for a different reason that most stated here.<br>
They are saying that there all the &#8220;abortion clinics&#8221; are in black areas.<br>
Then they say that black women have less access the birth control and sex education. <br>
What the fail to leave out is that abortion clinics aren&rsquo;t just abortion clinics. I don&rsquo;t know of a single clinic that just performs abortions. All the abortion clinics offer birth control, not just to women but to underage girls without parental consent and sex education to anyone who wants it. <br>
They also treat women and men for STDs, and again, underage girls with no parental consent can get STDs treated. <br>
So all the &#8220;abortion clinic&#8221; stuff is just a bunch of bull. Because abortion clinics also offer every type of birth control, even, to underage girls, why aren&rsquo;t they saying that because all these clinics are in &#8220;black neighbourhoods&#8221; that white women and white girls have no access to birth control and treatment of STDs. <br>
These crazy people just can&rsquo;t figure out what they want can they?</p>
