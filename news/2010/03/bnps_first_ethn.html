<h1>BNP&rsquo;s First Ethnic Member Appointed Special Advisor on Islamic Extremism to Nick Griffin</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, March 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The British National Party&rsquo;s first ethnic member, Rajinder Singh, has been appointed special advisor on Islamic extremism to Nick Griffin and has been tasked with preparing an initial report on the extent to which British society has already been Islamified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Singh has personal experience of the consequences of the Islamification of his home country and is thus in a perfect situation to point out all the tell-tale warning signs,&#8221; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;His first assignment is to prepare a comprehensive overview of the Islamic presence in Britain and the extent to which that community has been radicalised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Topics which will be covered include identifying the &#8216;tipping point&rsquo; at which Muslim numbers become an overwhelming influence; how the Labour and Tory-supported wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played into the hands of the Islamic fundamentalists; and the use of &#8216;Islamic centres&rsquo; as a means for creating de facto mosques,&#8221; Mr Griffin said.</p>
<p>Mr Singh said he was &#8220;very pleased&#8221; to be taking on this role so soon after having joined the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said all along that the single greatest danger threatening the existence of Britain is the creeping Islamification process.</p>
<p>&#8220;If left unchecked, radical Islam will spell the death knell for all other religions and cultures,&#8221; Mr Singh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the Britain in which I first settled, and do not want it to face the same fate as my homeland. I saw with my own eyes the destruction that radical Islamism wrought, and if I can help prevent that happening here, I will have contributed to saving this nation,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>So we are focusing only on Islam now?  An Indian has joined the BNP who seems to be heavily focused only on Islam and so everything is just fine and dandy?  What about the issue of his own kind coming into England?</p>
<p>I am really getting tired of Indians getting a free pass all the time.  They are the one immigrant group that comes from the Third World that all white countries seem to prematurely adore.  People view them as &#8220;smart&#8221; and &#8220;peaceful&#8221;.  Enough with this ignorance.  </p>
<p>Small numbers of India&rsquo;s best and brightest MIGHT be okay, but all you need to do is look at India to see what high numbers of this immigrant group will eventually bring with them.  I don&rsquo;t find much of anything admirable about them.  If I wish to admire them I can go to India.  They have no business in white countries, at least at the rate they are pouring into them.</p>
<p>Political Correctness in Britain wins, and sanity loses, once again. Political Correctness: 1 - BNP: 0.</p>

		<p>Strange bedfellows we have here, unless Mr. Singh is an avowed believer of some religion other than Islam. A person who is a true believer of Islam is by name a radical, if they follow their rule book, which calls for the destruction of all infidels. So, are we to assume he is a true believer, thus a wolf in sheeps clothing, or someone like many so called Christians, who won&rsquo;t really follow what their book tells them to do? If he is, a true believer he is going against what his god, allah the moon god has told him is right. Humans are evil by nature, and must work hard to overcome this. Thus the saying, &#8220;The highway to hell is easy and many will find the way, but the pathway to heaven is narrow, and difficult and only a few will ever find their way&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know, this man seems dedicated to the party, and to ending the Islamification of Britain.  Admitting him is a good publicity stunt for the BNP, but he also seems comitted.  I wouldn&rsquo;t take this as evidence that the BNP&rsquo;s &#8216;face is changing&rsquo;.  The party is still committed to its principles and won&rsquo;t become like the labour or tory parties.</p>

<p>Such sentiments are exactly what the BNP needs.</p>
<p>I think the reason why Nick Griffin appointed him to such a position is so he can act as a token. The BNP is always being called racist, but it would appear ironic, and therefore dishonest, to call the BNP racist if they had a non-white member in a prominent position.</p>
<p>I disagree that the face of the BNP is &#8220;changing.&#8221; Having just one non-white token isn&rsquo;t going to alter the party to a radical extent, if at all. Besides, if this man agrees with the BNP&rsquo;s pro-British principles, why not let him support the party?</p>

		<p>I said this before on the BNP issue of having non-whites.  While I appreciate the few non-whites there are who are against the anti-white bigotry, we don&rsquo;t need them to validate our cause.  In fact, having to get validation is what will destroy the Tea Party Movement, what&rsquo;s destroyed the Republican Party, and the Minutemen as well.  Even Malcolm X said having whites who were sympathetic to the black nationalt cause being in black-centered organizations would eventually start catering to whites.  The same will happen with every pro-Western and pro-white organization.</p>

		<p>The British government forced the BNP to accept minorities in its ranks.  Very well.  They&rsquo;ve done so.  And this is a brilliant choice.  A minority who will speak out against the violence and intimidation of Muslims.  Brilliant!  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;issue&#8221; of this (well-informed and eminently sensible) Sikh man&rsquo;s &#8220;own kind&#8221; (i.e. Sikhs) &#8220;coming into England&#8221; is that very few of them actually have, and those that have are (with very few exceptions) well-integrated into English society, unlike most Muslims.</p>
<p>Believe me, as an English nationalist, the Sikhs are our friends and allies in the war against the Muslims. Unlike the Muslims (whom they know extremely well, and detest for very good reasons), they are happy to abide by our laws, and allow our society to remain Christian and European in character. Hit out at them and you are utterly missing the real target.</p>

		<p>With a name like Singh he is likely a Pakistani that watched his country become totally controlled by groups like the Taliban, so I believe he would know what to look for. The problem is, no one will listen at this time. I think there may be some brutal sharia killings in Britain&rsquo;s future which will bring culture shock home to them and in my visits most all the &#8220;Indians&#8221; one sees are in fact, muslim Pakistanis.. The country of India is under seige by muslims as is Thailand, a place I have many fond memories of from the Viet Nam war. During my time there, there were no muslims, now they are blowing up stuff and murdering people AS USUAL! People, this muslim threat must be taken more seriously in Britain and in the U.S. to include the stOOpid black converts.</p>

		<p>Muslims are not the only enemy of Europe, all non-whites are. Our mission should be to remove all non Whites and White traitors from Europe not just Muslims. Do not fear those outsiders (Muslims) who are showing their hatred for us openly in support of those invaders (Hindus, Christian blacks etc&hellip;) who conceal their hatred for us but still hate us none the less. Hindus and Sikhs are definitely the allies of Europe and the West against Muslims as long as they all stay in South Asia not Europe or other Western lands. Only then can an alliance be made with them to keep the mullahs in check.</p>

		<p>No 1.  Do not let your blinkers stop you seeing.  There are many Asians in Briatin who are British and want to be seen as such, but the major problem faced and it is/will be in te USA etc, is the radical Muslims weho have seen the west give in tom terrorism elsewhere and allowed the terrorists to take over so if it takes 50 years, that is the big plan.  But the British &#8220;true blue&#8221; Asians are intelligent enough to know that if the Muslims take over, they will have to leave aqgain to find another civilised country so Nick griffin and the BNp has scorede a coup inh nthat in a year&rsquo;s time, the opposition Parties in politics (remember that the BNP is a legally registered political party) will find it very difficult to use insults and ad hominen to fight what will become a popular party.  Already many who were abour (Democrats) etc are saying openly they intend to vote BNP in te next national election and even the British Press in their comments/readers letters columns are printing these thoughts.  The pendulum is swinging back to sanity.</p>
<p>We, my wife and I,met a charming Pakistani/British family on a day holiday trip to Morocco recently (we live near Gibraltar in Spain) aenly chatted with us.  The teenage kids were also well behaved and affable.</p>
<p>So there is hope as long as we do not let the liberal fools (and the socialists)spoil it all.</p>
<p>Incidentally I read in the US Press that many are worried about your Pres. Obama&rsquo;s socialist actions.  God forbid he is allowed to do the same as the socialists (Labour) have done to Britain but then. as I understand it, the the World financial crisis<br>
started in the USA.</p>
<p>God bless us all.</p>

		<p>I believe Mr. Rajinder Singh is from the Punjab so when he speaks of his homeland he means the Punjab and not India as a whole. Punjab Sikhs have been marginalised by expansionist Islam since the creation of India and Pakistan in 1948 and Mr. Singh knows only too well the results of allowing Islamic expansionism. Sikhs are not a colonising religion and reasonable numbers of them have settled well in the UK and have a history of supporting the BNP when attcked by the multicultural British establishment. Mr Singh is on record many times as stating that the UK is full and the country should remain what it always has been, the homeland of the indigenous British people. He is the perfect foil to the totalitarian left who brainwash the public with their cries of &#8216;racism&rsquo; at anyone who opposes multiculturalism/mass immigration into white-majority countries. </p>

		<p>These are the days of the tribulations. Christians are being persecuted for their faith all over Europe. The UK is the worst. They tear down ancient Christian churches and build mosques in their place. Today France has more mosques than churches. Islam is not a religion, it is a satanic cult and the majority of Western politicians have abandoned Christianity to support it&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m appalled by the ignorance displayed by some of the posters on this thread. Courtney, the problem is bigger than Islam, but Islam does constitute a huge chunk of the problem. White Slave, the Indian gentleman spoken is a Sikh, a follower of a totally different religion - he is NOT Muslim.<br>
Sikhs are specifically protected under existing British law. Furthermore, the BNP is now required to take on ethnic applicants who wish to become members.<br>
Overall, this move by Nick Griffin constitutes a major public relations coup. Get over it.</p>

		<p>Just a tip for those that have assumed that this Indian man may be a Muslim, his last name is Singh, a very common Sikh name. If you meet a person with that last name you can be assured that he is of Sikh heritage, though by looking at Mr. Rajinder Singh, you can also tell that he is not a practicing Sikh. Sikhs are forbidden to cut their hair or shave, which is the reason they wear turbans. Mr. Singh&rsquo;s clean shaven face and turbanless head shows that he is not a devout follower. </p>

		<p>@ Keep Britain British - Courtney seems to have a particular dislike of Indians and she&rsquo;s entitled to her opinion - but I agree with you that Sikhs, Hindus and Buddhists are not a significant problem in Great Britain or America. Some - such as the Sikhs and (hindu) Gurkhas have a long tradition of military service to Great Britain, both in the British Empire and modern times. Their numbers are low and they are overwhelmingly law abiding and well educated. I do agree with Courtney that large scale immigration from Muslim or non-Muslim countries in Asia is undesirable.</p>
<p>American conservatives who criticize the BNP for inviting this Sikh gentleman to join may want to consider the fact that the Republican party had similar motivations when they appointed Michael Steele chairman. </p>

<p><br>
Quite so   &mdash;   but let&rsquo;s not forget that the UK legal establishment FORCED the BNP to admit nonwhites; whereas the Republicans VOLUNTARILY turned their Party over to Mr. Steele in a desperate bid to appear &#8220;hip&#8221; and &#8220;with-it&#8221; in the wake of the ascendancy of the Mulatto Messiah. </p>
<p>(If I may make a peculiar analogy: It&rsquo;s like back in 1967, right after The Beatles released their psychedelic <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> album, the Beatles&rsquo; rivals, The Rolling Stones, suddenly felt the need to make a super-groovy psychedelic record too (the disastrous <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>) despite the fact that psychedelic music is as inappropriate for a bluesy group like the Rolling Stones as a black Chairman is for the GOP.) </p>
<p>So actually the BNP&rsquo;s &#8220;motives&#8221; were NOT the same as the Republicans. The BNP&rsquo;s &#8220;motive&#8221; was not to be LEGALLY DISBANDED AND CRIMINALIZED by the courts   &mdash;   which would have flushed down the toilet almost 30 years of effort by countless patriots from Nick Griffin on down to the lowliest Party volunteer. The BNP did NOT change their policy to score some sort of PR coup; they did it because the Multicult pressed a gun to their head. </p>
<p>But now that it&rsquo;s done, it WILL act as a PR coup because the MSM will find themselves unable to excoriate and tell outright lies about the BNP nearly as viciously now that they&rsquo;re no longer exclusively white. Ultimately, the admission of Mr. Singh and a few (preferably not TOO many!) nonwhite faces into the British National Party is a good thing for the BNP, and for Britain as a whole. </p>

And so do I.  As well as the reasoned comments  of BJ Deller, BoredinVA, KeepBritainBritish, and others who have pointed that this was a shrewd (and necessary!) move to avoid being &#8220;LEGALLY DISBANDED AND CRIMINALIZED by the courts&#8221;.   Given that fact, it may not be ideal, but it is the best move can expect under the circumstances. What other option was there?</p>
<p>And btw, Sikhs are NOT Moslems! They have fought Islam for centuries. Sikhs are to Islam what the mongoose is to the cobra.</p>

		<p>I think some people on here are overreacting to what posters such as myself have said.  My concern is very legitimate.  I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily blaming the BNP for the move they made.  I am upset that the multicultural establishment forced them to do such a thing.  And I was also concerned that this move would excuse the case for non-Muslim Asians in Britain.</p>
<p>Obviously the most ideal situation would be for the BNP to be all white.  But given the circumstances, I agree that a Sikh is the best choice.  And now that some British posters on here have elloquently explained who the Sikhs are, and that there aren&rsquo;t very many of them in Britain, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with this appointment anymore.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t confuse me with the poster above who assumed this man was Muslim.  I agree that that post was hard to understand and a bit odd. I think sometimes posters on here enjoy attacking certain posters for their viewpoints and singling them out (in my case my dislike for large scale Indian immigration) instead of reading the actual content of the particular post at hand and trying to understand where a particular poster is coming from.  Now that some posters above were polite enough to explain that Sikhs are not a problem, I have a better understanding of the situation.  A simple explanation is all that is necessary; not all this attacking and singling out that constantly goes on on here.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I do agree with Courtney that large scale immigration from Muslim or non-Muslim countries in Asia is undesirable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you, for understanding where I was coming from on this note.  How dare I come on this website and get upset over large numbers of Indians in great Britain.  I agree that this Sikh was the best the BNP could do considering the circumstances they have been up against, but it seems like some people are suddenly going against my original argument a little too much and going in the other direction justifying Indians in Great Britain overall just because they are &#8220;better&#8221; than Muslims.</p>
<p>ghw, you seem to usually be a reasonable poster, (usually one of my favorites) but sometimes it seems like you enjoy joining the bandwagon and agreeing with every single poster in a discussion who happens to disagree with me on a topic.  I like the way you compliment BJ Deller&rsquo;s post that was directed at me even though his post was filled with grammatical errors and he seems to think Indians and non-Muslim Asians in general are &#8220;perfectly fine&#8221; in Great Britain.  You have done the same thing to me before in other discussions.  I would like to know what your personal opinion is on topics sometimes instead of seeing you coming into discussions and giving &#8220;at a boy&#8221; comments to every single poster who happens to disagree with me.</p>

<p>I think this is extreme and unfair.  I am not an enemy of Japanese Americans, and most of them don&rsquo;t see themselves as my enemy.  I know Asian Indians who are perfectly fine people, and second generation Indians are little different from white Americans other than having a browner shade of skin.  No, I do not favor the mass immigration of Indians here (we have enough people, and enough of our jobs already taken by immigrants) but I don&rsquo;t see every Indian as the enemy of whites.</p>
<p>The BNP faces serious legal challenges and is being forced by the real enemies of Britain (not Indians, but the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal parties) to accept non-whites.  Bringing in a man like Rajinder Singh is an excellent way to meet the legal requirements.</p>

		<p>Singh has gone on TV as admitting he has no problem with England staying majority white(how many whites would do this) and non-whites being paid to leave, therefore I have no problem with him being in the BNP.</p>

		<p>And in my above post I apologize for not capitalizing the &#8220;Great&#8221; in &#8220;Great Britain&#8221;.  How would I miss that?</p>
<p>WR the elder, I see your point and slightly agree.  But I just hope a lot of people posting under this article aren&rsquo;t implying that non-Muslim Asian immigration to Britain is suddenly okay.  Large numbers of any nonwhite group are never okay.  They are obviously going to change the character of any white society (for the good or bad; usually bad).  It disturbs me how far a lot of posters on here are taking their arguments to support this Sikh.  Are all of you suddenly saying that non-Muslim Asian immigration into white countries is okay?</p>
<p>And I am sorry, while I agree that East Asians (such as Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese) are smart, I DO NOT agree with the same conclusion about Indians.  Yes, we have the best and brightest coming here, but to imply that if we open the flood gates of India and allow them all to pour in here is just fine and dandy, we are being foolish.  Just because a small percentage of Indians are smart, that doesn&rsquo;t mean most of them are.  Take a look at India.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Mr Singh has personal experience of the consequences of the Islamification of his home country and is thus in a perfect situation to point out all the tell-tale warning signs,&rdquo; Mr Griffin said.<br>
 * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>By his &#8220;home country&#8221; what is doubtless meant is The Punjab (in the extreme north of India),  not either Pakistan or India. Punjab is the Sikhs&rsquo; home.</p>

		<p>Every movement has its purists who hold that no approach that can work in the real world is worthwhile&hellip;it&rsquo;s nice to see that that hasn&rsquo;t been the reaction here to Mr. Singh&rsquo;s appointment (and it certainly gives me no pleasure to write such a non-European name in any connection to the BNP).</p>
<p>But the brilliant Mr. Griffin is the ultimate &#8220;race REALIST.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has gauged the REALITY within which he must operate, and has found a way (has anyone else?) to get large numbers of white people to start thinking of themselves as a race and ethnic group with its own interests&hellip;could anything be a better first step for our movement???</p>

		<p>H.Dumpty is correct that many rigid purists are too doctrinaire and unrealistic in their intransigence.  By being so inflexible, they will get nowhere and accomplish nothing.  Mr. Griffin, however, is a pragmatist and a realist in recognizing  &#8220;the REALITY within which he must operate.&#8221;   Therefore, while I don&rsquo;t applaud it as ideal, he has made the best choice possible in the circumstances. </p>

<p>Courtney, sometimes I think you just insist on being ornery.  Where did I ever say I wanted to open the flood gates to Indian immigration (which all by itself could double our population).  I explicitly stated the opposite.  I am aware that most of the Indians immigrating here are college educated and probably have significantly higher IQ than the average Indian in India.   But that has nothing to do with my statement that it is foolish to consider all non-whites to be enemies of whites.  Heck, there are blacks I don&rsquo;t consider to be my &#8220;enemy&#8221;.  Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, Elaine Wright, and other real black conservatives are sensible people and if all blacks thought like they do we could all just get along.</p>

		<p>WR the elder,</p>
<p>I was just making a general statement to most of the posters on here.  That wasn&rsquo;t directed at you.  I just wanted to make sure we are all clear on this topic.  I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily saying you said that.  I think the problem here is there is misunderstanding coming from both sides.  Sometimes when we feel bold about a topic we just type what we feel and people take it the wrong way.  I am just as guilty as anybody.  But if you go back and read my post again, while I was directing part of it at you, I didn&rsquo;t necessarily direct the whole thing at you.</p>

		<p>Having visited the BNP website almost daily for the past month or so, I can say with some confidence that the BNP is not giving up its ethnically-based principles. They may have admitted one Indian man, but at their core they still believe in deporting illegal immigrants, halting non-British immigration, and supporting voluntary repatriation. Most members still carry a &#8220;Britain for the British&#8221; tone in their political views.</p>
<p>I believe that a small number of minorities in England cannot be a bad thing, especially since the Sikhs were loyal British subjects at one time, and if Mr. Singh supports voluntary repatriation of non-British people living in the UK, then he is a good political ally and will only help the white nationalist movement.</p>
