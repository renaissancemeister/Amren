<h1>Pinellas School Board Chairwoman Under Fire for Calling Disruptive Students &#8216;Hoodlums&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Matus and Jamal Thalji, St. Petersburg Times, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pinellas School Board chairwoman Janet Clark is coming under fire for using the term &#8220;hoodlums&#8221; to describe a small group of chronically disruptive students in county schools.</p>
<p>Board members Mary Brown and Linda Lerner criticized Clark at Tuesday night&rsquo;s board meeting. And now Ray Tampa, president of the St. Petersburg branch of the NAACP, said Clark&rsquo;s refusal to apologize has made things worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was disgusted with her response,&#8221; Tampa said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The International People&rsquo;s Democratic Uhuru Movement  &mdash;  better known as the Uhurus  &mdash;  called for Clark to resign for the statement, which it viewed as racist. Clark is white. Tampa said he thought the comment was inappropriate, but not racist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clark made the comment at a board workshop last week in a wide-ranging discussion about chronically disruptive students at John Hopkins Middle School and other Pinellas schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much time is taken up with addressing hoodlums, with kids who don&rsquo;t want to be in school,&#8221; she said. She also said, &#8220;We are talking about a small number of children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown and Lerner weighed in Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might be disruptive. They might be in gangs. They might be many things, but they are not hoodlums,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I feel that that statement showed insensitivity to our children, and it certainly did not offer good guidance to our staff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are people upset out there about the comment, different kinds of people, including employees,&#8221; Lerner said. &#8220;We have to be careful as board members when we speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the meeting, Clark said the statement had nothing to do with race. &#8220;I made no mention of race,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are hoodlums of all races and colors and ethnic backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>But Clark may have stepped into a situation where the same word conjures up different images, depending on who hears it.</p>
<p>It does not appear the origins of the word &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; have any ties to race or ethnicity. It is an adaptation of a German word that meant &#8220;ragamuffin&#8221; or &#8220;good for nothing,&#8221; said Michael Adams, an associate professor of English at Indiana University and author of the 2009 book, Slang: The People&rsquo;s Poetry.</p>
<p>But the meanings of words can change, Adams said. Over time, &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; may have become a more racially identifiable word, in part because of the slang term &#8220;hood,&#8221; short for neighborhood, and also because hood and hoodlum began to be applied to African-American youths by white people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoodlum, when you look it up in the dictionary, doesn&rsquo;t look so bad,&#8221; Adams said. But when people in the black community hear it, &#8220;they associate it with words and meanings other than (those from) 1871 or whenever it was the word first appeared in print.&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor said the case reminds him of the uproar from a 1999 incident when a Washington D.C., city official used the term &#8220;niggardly&#8221; to describe how he was managing budget cuts. It means &#8220;miserly,&#8221; but another employee took it as a racial slur.</p>
<p>Said Adams: &#8220;What people hear always means something more than what a word may mean historically.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whites should realize that blacks often do not know the dictionary meanings of common words. So they must always be on guard and think ahead to imagine what meaning blacks may give to a word based on its sound or some &#8220;mental&#8221; image it my produce in them.</p>

		<p>I believe Miss Clark when she said it had nothing to do with race.  However, her critics have just implicitly admitted that almost all the problems in the Pinellas schools are black-caused.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;They might be disruptive. They might be in gangs. They might be many things, but they are not hoodlums,&rdquo; Brown said.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying that he might be a murderer, but he&rsquo;s no criminal.</p>

		<p>Take a look at the rhetoric of these comments regarding the disparate impact of sentencing, for it contains the essential code words in the social justice formula.   Elite whites always fall for this trick. They can&rsquo;t resist giving in to this kind of manipulation of the Anglo Saxon White cultural defect of feeling virtuous through administering fair play:</p>

&ldquo;There is no justification for this remaining sentencing gap,&#8221; said Jennifer Bellamy, ACLU Legislative Counsel. &#8220;This legislation is long overdue but it does not go far enough. With bills in both chambers and a president demanding legislative action, we finally have the political will and momentum to end this unconstitutional disparity. We should not miss this opportunity to effect real change and ensure fair sentencing for all Americans.&#8221;<br>

		<p>See how teachers learn to teach your children to surrender their White Identity, which is the scourge of the planet. </p>
<p>If Whites will stop thinking of themselves as White, then they won&rsquo;t notice that all their White invented government, schools, hospitals, churches, neighborhoods, philosophies, and sciences are being taken away from them by non whites who are aided and abetted by White liberal elites who will always keep their own white jobs and white pensions.</p>

<p>What If All the Kids Are White?: Anti-bias Multicultural Education With Young Children And Families (Early Childhood Education Series)</p>
<p>Product Description</p>
<p>In this compelling volume, distinguished educators tackle a frequently asked question about multicultural education: How do I teach about racial and cultural diversity if all my students are white? The authors propose seven learning themes to help young white children resist messages of racism and build identity and skills for thriving in a multicultural country and world. The text includes strategies, resources, and classroom examples for implementing the learning themes in early childhood settings. <br>
Taking multicultural education to a new level, this practical guide: <br>
* Places the development of white children&rsquo;s racial identity in the context of the historical construction of &#8220;whiteness&#8221; and racism in America. <br>
* Suggests strategies for nurturing a new white identity as the starting place for anti-bias/multicultural work with children. <br>
* Offers ways to expand children&rsquo;s interests and concerns beyond their immediate world to instill a sense of caring and connection toward people different from them and to encourage seeing themselves as agents of change. <br>
* Includes activities for families and staff, reflection questions, a review of white anti-racism activists, lists of suggested children&rsquo;s books, and organizational and website resources. </p>

		<p>&#8220;But the meanings of words can change, Adams said. Over time, &ldquo;hoodlum&rdquo; may have become a more racially identifiable word, in part because of the slang term &ldquo;hood,&rdquo; short for neighborhood, and also because hood and hoodlum began to be applied to African-American youths by white people, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it might have even become a descriptive word to identify out-of-control blacks who have about a third of their male population in prison, jail, probation or parole, but for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t call them what they are.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t mention the black high crime rate that is out-of-control, because that will make the same people mad.  And, of course, we must all understand that we are supposed to tolerate all these black pathologies thrust upon us and act as if they don&rsquo;e exist or that we enjoy them.</p>
<p>Remember Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s arrest for civil disobedience, because he was protesting the expusion of numerous black teens who were fighting on school grounds?  Well, like him, most blacks want us to put up with these hoodlums and give them maybe a written reprimand instead of punishment, because, as they claim using their distinct ability to reason, white kids chew gum in class and aren&rsquo;t expelled so &#8220;why should the brothers be punished?&#8221;</p>
<p>Who can respond effectively to such brilliant logic?</p>

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t understand the King&rsquo;s English.  They don&rsquo;t understand proper American English either.  Not even the educated ones.  They don&rsquo;t like to read, they&rsquo;d NEVER open a dictionary under any circumstances, and they don&rsquo;t speak English amongst themselves - they speak Ghetto-ese or Ebonics or some pidgin English that rarely includes the plural &#8220;s&#8221;.  Such as Fiddy Cent.  However, in the Black Run America, THEIR ignorance of English becomes white racism.  The teacher in question did not do anything wrong.  She should be grateful she was not physically attacked in the meeting though, through black ignorance of English.  Been known to happen.</p>

<p>Say WHAT?! &#8220;Hood&#8221; and &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; have two different origins. </p>
<p>Who is it that gave the word &#8220;hood&#8221; its racial connotations anyway? It was blacks themselves, not whites, contrary to what the lying professor claims. &#8220;Boyz in Da Hood.&#8221; Remember them? That wasn&rsquo;t a white group. </p>
<p>Here we have blacks giving a word racial connotations, and then blaming whites for it, with the aid of people like this lying professor. </p>
<p>Words have always been used to define and describe undesirable behavior, but the liberal lefties want the power to do so only for themselves, with their playground slur of &#8220;racist&#8221; and their idiotic designation of &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221; </p>
<p>But a nonwhite can never be labelled with a pejorative term. Even &#8220;juvenile delinquents&#8221; becomes merely &#8216;youths,&#8221; which can be applied equally to a church choir as to a pack of gang rapists. </p>
<p>Oh, excuse me, &#8220;gang rape&#8221; is a term we also can&rsquo;t use anymore. I forgot.</p>

<p>This is the height of the coming thought police era that we are facing.  Even a neutral word is now taboo, and no more words are allowed to describe trouble makers, as if they simply do not exist.</p>
<p>I am reminded of one Jewish principal I had, uber liberal, by the way.  Even though we were in a high school, and most of the boys were 17 to 20 year old men, she always referred to them as &#8216;children.&rsquo;  We on the staff always thought they were grown men.  Some of them were fathers.  Many were in gangs.  A big chunk only came to school so their mommas wouldn&rsquo;t lose their &#8216;binafits.&rsquo;  Others came to sell drugs or go shopping for the young girls, as in trying to &#8216;git wit&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Would I describe them as hoodlums?  Yes.  Do I think it applies to race?  That&rsquo;s just plain stupid.  I knew white hoodlums growing up in my very neighborhood.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite true that blacks wouldn&rsquo;t be bothered to look up a word&rsquo;s meaning in a dictionary.  Damn, I had a tenure track black female professor teaching a graduate level english lit seminar (african american lit, of course) who would &#8220;axe&#8221; us questions about the readings.  &#8220;Let me axe you this&hellip;&#8221;  It is certainly true, however, that the meaning of a word has a different context depending on who hears or utters it.  Working in a grocery store in a &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhood had me dealing, five or six times a day, with &#8220;diverse&#8221; customers axing my what aisle the &#8220;crackas&#8221; were on.  They certainly had a gleam in their eyes to match the shiny grills on their teef when they lisped it, and shuffled off cackling madly.</p>

		<p>Hoodlums doesn`t describe the nature of Bay Area young deviants. I have been lucky enough to survive Mexico City, Liberty City, Hue Viet Nam, Washington D.C. [ now that was rough ] and San Juan Puerto Rico; however The Tampa Bay area makes them all look like Lourdes or Fatima. When people break down on the causeways, they take their pistols out of the glove compartments and put them on the dash so  odd young black rampagers know they might have trouble.<br>
     The Pinellas County Jail resembles the Tombs at Rikers except there are more gang signs. The cops have quit arresting any hoodlums unless they fall over them because the FBI spends every waking moment trying to frame them for Civil Rights violations.The situation created by 60 years of welfare and illegal immigration has turned the once excellent Bay Schools into grim, concertina wired, gulags. Even the Mafia in Ybor City fear the black teenage gangs that have started to loot the old Italian enclave.<br>

		<p>Johnathan is correct; whites are being outsmarted at every turn and aren&rsquo;t even smart enough to survive.  Plus, whites don&rsquo;t have the will to fight to survive.</p>
<p>Machete will still be spelled and pronounced the same when the last white neck is severed.  </p>
<p>Laws don&rsquo;t protect you anymore and anyone protecting you in the streets is deemed to be a &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Most of the naive whites believe that person to be a racist fool as well.  So what will happen to whitey?  Hold your neck out, this should come as no surprise.</p>

		<p>This one really took me aback.  Once again, I fell into the trap of thinking that Americans all understand certain words to mean certain things.  I forgot about the rampant ignorance and politicization of language.</p>
<p>From the article:  &#8220;hoodlum began to be applied to African-American youths by white people&#8221;.  Gee, I wonder if behavior had anything to do with it, i.e. the dictionary definition of &#8220;hoodlum&#8221;?</p>
<p>I can only venture a guess that regional pronunciations differ.  Mine rhymes with &#8220;dude-lum&#8221;.  Maybe others say it like &#8220;wood-lum&#8221;.  In that case, the chronically stupid might take &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; to mean &#8220;a denizen of the &#8216;hood&#8221;, i.e. a black punk.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just a guess.  More likely, blacks have been described as hoodlums so often that it&rsquo;s harder to separate out the racial component.</p>
<p>What bothers any sane person about this article is that the black kids are disrupting school each day, and yet that seems to matter less than the word &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; being uttered during the course of a session attended by politically alert listeners.</p>

		<p>Whites should always keep in mind that when blacks or some black organization makes a public demonstrating calling for the dismissal of some white over some trivial incident, it is not that they really are offended or consider it serious, it is just a power game. Get some white fired, no matter how innocent, and you acquire intimidation power. Right or wrong has nothing to do with it, it&rsquo;s about power. </p>

		<p>More white people have learned about blacks and race.  The lessons will keep on coming until critical mass is reached, and only then will sensible people put a stop to all the self-destructive black &#8220;reasoning&#8221; along with their violence.  There will come a day when blacks will no longer be taken seriously about anything. </p>

		<p>This is nothing more than a red herring the local NAACP chapter and this other group have seized upon to attract attention. And anyone with an IQ above 90 knows it.  Peace and harmony are not in these groups&rsquo; best interest.</p>
<p>Without racial contention these groups cease to exist, so they run with whatever they can get their disruptive grubby fingers around, often making it up as they go. They come off as fools to most whites, which matters none whatsoever to them.  Their desire is to stir it up, heat it till it boils over, which keeps them in the money.  Racism is a cash cow in the black community if milked properly and who better knows than black &#8220;racial equality&#8221; organizations which teats to pull to start the cash flow.</p>
<p>Newspapers and other media buy into it.  Local white bleeding hearts help carry the banner, knowing full well the issue is bogus, but will do and say whatever to assuage their self imposed guilt for being white and all the while completely destroying any possibility to provide a platform resonable black citizens could stand upon and shout, &#8220;She&rsquo;s right! They are hoodlums!&#8221;</p>
<p>Silly and effete white people such as those are responsible equally for this kind of bogus protest.  We need to get our house in order before we can assist repairing the plights and blights which infect black communities.  White citizens need to stand up, plain and simple.  It isn&rsquo;t racism to tell black citizens they are wrong and that they do not have your support on an issue; we manage to do so amongst ourselves without igniting civil warfare, or our neighborhoods.  Let&rsquo;s see if our white officials stand muster in this situation and oppose our black officials.</p>
<p>I have grave doubts.  I fear &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; will become the new seven letter six letter word.  Rob them of the opportunity; begin using &#8220;hoodlum&#8221; to describe every hoodlum of whom you hear - white, black, hispanic, or asian.  We need to cease rolling over at the sound of a cheap public address system.  We should do what&rsquo;s right - and forget guilt.  I have nothing for which to feel guilty with regards to race.  Never owned a slave - don&rsquo;t want one - and I&rsquo;ve never oppressed anyone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frightening that you are in danger of bodily harm or even the loss of your life because people don&rsquo;t know what words mean and can&rsquo;t understand them in context.  </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t expect the social crusaders in the court system to have any sympathy.  They&rsquo;ll tell you that it&rsquo;s your fault because you didn&rsquo;t hang on every word you said in the company of the uneducated and uncivilized.  </p>
<p>After all, they can&rsquo;t be expected to restrain themselves.  Even the liberals know this.  It&rsquo;s a part of their flawed narrative they&rsquo;ve never been able to explain away, so they just blame it on you, because you know you bear the responsibility for slavery.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if your ancestors didn&rsquo;t come here until 1914.  It&rsquo;s still your fault.</p>

<p>Bleeding heart, progressive liberal culture IS BLACK CULTURE.  Blacks are the endgame of liberal cultural change.  Feminazis model their ideal woman image on the black female.  Hollywood models its ultimate badboy prototype on the black thug.  Blacks were Marxists before Marx was even born.  Tribal, communal, polygamous, nomadic, voodoo and mojo behavior.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>How true!  I finally got a chance yesterday to watch the Bearded Man video about the fight on the Oakland bus.  On reading the comments posted there, I was stunned (horrified is really the word) with how incredibly juvenile, ignorant, crude, uncouth,<br>
incoherent, immature, all of them were.  ALL!   It was generally impossible to tell the whites from the blacks, except for who was rooting for whom.  I thought, &#8220;Are these vulgar,  inarticulate slobs really OUR people?&#8221;  If so, who could care?  A half century of dumbing-down and forced equalizing has turned a great mass of whites into virtual blacks.  The New Proletariat for the New World Order.</p>
<p>And, btw, BeardedMan is not really the white hero the fans who idealize him imagine him to be. He saw no racial aspects in the altercation, and he repeatedly stated, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not prejudiced.&#8221;  Well, maybe he SHOULD be! If he doesn&rsquo;t see anything racial there, then he&rsquo;s as hopeless as most other brainwashed whites. To him, it was just an incident between two guys, one of whom happened to be black and the other white. That&rsquo;s all. No further significance.  He reminded me of all those pathetic victims who insist, after the crime, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not prejudiced or anything. There wasn&rsquo;t anything racial about this.&#8221;   Yeah, sure.  Some people are just too blind to see what&rsquo;s in front of their noses.</p>

		<p>What will ultimately &#8220;wake up&#8221; what&rsquo;s left of the white race in America is the realization that Afrocentric liberal-left culture has unavoidable consequences - when America becomes hobbled into an artificial state of poverty.  When whites collectively realize they aren&rsquo;t living in an acceptable way any longer, their white nature will begin to kick in.  And that will give birth to a new generation of white leaders who will address reform fearlessly.</p>
<p>It is no accident and no small coincidence that the seats of liberalism in America resides in every place where blacks are concentrated and wield power to rob the treasuries:  In the cities.</p>
<p>Whites lean to Libertarian-capitalism by nature;  in that they intinctively want to own and work for themselves, to produce, to innovate and to overcome the uncertainties of life and nature.</p>
<p>Blacks are MARXIST by nature in nearly every way.  Marxism is, in fact, the very model of traditional black culture.  Blacks work against individualism, innovation, traditional education, and punish individualism.  </p>
<p>Whites have to be trained to act culturally black by decades of indoctrination.  And once they become trained, they are invariably and absolutely LIBERAL-LEFTIST-PROGRESSIVE.  They become effectively black.</p>
<p>Socialism in America WON&rsquo;T look like socialism in Sweden looked 40 years ago.  Why?  Because in Sweden, the lowest common denominator was still white.  The worst, most unnatural structure for whites nevertheless worked optimally for them.  In America, the lowest common denominator is black.  And blacks will gladly live like they live in Cuba, when everything is given to them and when non-blacks are forced to be as wretched as they are.</p>
<p>Cuba is nothing but a big African village ruled by a culturally black chieftain.</p>

		<p>lol, this story is so ridiculous it almost doesn&rsquo;t warrant commenting on. I wonder if calling someone a &#8220;murderer&#8221; will soon have racial overtones because blacks are overrepresented in the murdering population. What&rsquo;s really funny is the person who said, &#8220;they may be in gangs, but they are not hoodlums&#8221;. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I would see more racial overtones in &#8220;gang member&#8221; than &#8220;hoodlum&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #26.  I have taken classes in African history and culture (forced to btw) and everything about Africa is grass huts, tribal networks, mutual bribery and unbridled sex in a man-dominated world.  There are no boundaries that cannot be crossed from child-rape to cannibalism.</p>
<p>The libs loved Avatar because it presented such an ideal, tribal-based world.  White feminazis love that imagery because it hearkens to their true, secret desire, that of a savage man they can supposedly tame.</p>
<p>Remember when people started saying, &#8220;It takes a village to raise a child&#8221;?  Oh, how the libs loved to say that, and they had a dreamy glint in their eyes.  Remember Hillary Clinton and her fuss about it.  Sad thing is that they really have a village in mind.  not a small town like we have here, but some communal, tribal feel-good society where everyone is &#8216;equal&rsquo; and ready to share.</p>
<p>This African tribalism is washing over us.  A first world society cannot exist in a tribal context.  That is the real clash of civilizations going on.  At least with the Moslems they had a major world civilization.  We can at least talk about political structures with them on some level.  The Afrovoodoos never had one.  They are still tribal to this day, everywhere they are found in the world.</p>

The Wahabis eschew modern technology, medicine and such, but willingly use all of the said technology in their war against the civilized world. In the big military prison in Iraq called Camp Bucca, the Wahabis are kept in their own compound away from the rest of the Sunni and Shia muslims as there is even conflict between the Sunni and Shia against the Wahabii. The Iraqis hate the Saudis and the Saudis will not allow Iraqi muslims to pilgrimage to Mecca (RICH Iraqis are allowed to of course) and Mecca is controlled by the Wahabis. The muslim world is controlled by Saudi Arabia which in turn is controlled by the hateful Wahabii muslim royal family, and ruthlessly controlled at that.</p>

		<p>Martel (#21): So what&rsquo;s the issue? Blacks use bullying tactics to crush relatively innocent Whites, just to reinforce fear? You&rsquo;ve accidentally ommitted White Liberals. They are the iron fist of these Black bullies you refer to. The angry Blacks, themselves, usually possess no power at all to silence their White targets, but through protests, threats of boycotts, demands for action, etc., they entice naive, liberal Whites to fulfill their agenda. When a White bureacrat is &#8220;disgraced&#8221; for having passed a &#8220;racially insensitive&#8221; remark, how often is it a <i>Black</i> superior/board which fires him? The primary target of this type of discourse should not be the bullying Blacks themselves, who are irrelevant, but rather, the dim-bulb, liberal Whites who pander to them to protect their own image. This is a situation in which the enabler is the real threat. The angry, unreasonable Blacks themselves rarely stop to consider how powerless their methods would be without liberal Whites as their partners in crime.</p>

They hate us, blame us for all their problems, yet want our money and institutions to further their black power agenda.  They live around whites by choice and against our will, and then have the audacity to accuse us of racism.

     Crime and violence are lower in the Moslem world?  Then why are they so violent in Europe?  Could it be that their own governments are so brutal because they understand what is necessary to get them to behave?<br>
     Mental illness is lower in the Moslem world?  How would anyone know?  They seem to accept behavior that we regard as lunacy.  OTOH, if you recognize liberalism as a mental disturbance, perhaps you&rsquo;re right.  <br>
     Drug use is lower in the Moslem world?  Again, who knows?  Is anybody keeping track of the hash smokers in the alleys and courtyards of Damascus or Algiers?  The government might drop the hammer on idiotic Westerners, but do they trouble themselves with the local villagers?  <br>
     Homosexuality lower in the Moslem world?  When one rich man can hog four wives for himself, plus unlimited concubines, the men who are left out have to turn somewhere.  Homosexuality has long been officially forbidden and unofficially widespread and overlooked in much of the Moslem world. <br>
     AIDS rates are lower in Moslem countries?  Maybe.  But note that the countries that have the worst AIDS problems, in Africa, deny it.  </p>
<p>Only White countries publicly release these kinds of unflattering statistics about themselves, and even they conceal some of the statistics about the non-Whites among them.  It&rsquo;s hard to compare the West to countries that may not even keep any statistics, or that use police state methods to crush deviant behavior.  </p>
