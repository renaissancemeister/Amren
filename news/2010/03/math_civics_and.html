<h1>Math, Civics and Sciences Founder Alleges &#8216;Discrimination&rsquo; by Referees</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Silary, Philadelphia Daily News, March 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE CHARGE is serious and Veronica Joyner is prepared to make it.</p>
<p>Joyner, the founder and chief administrative officer of Math, Civics and Sciences Charter High, said her school&rsquo;s players, coaches and fans were subjected to racial discrimination last week during a PIAA Class A basketball playoff game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Joyner said she has found, in speaking with others, that Philadelphia schools routinely &#8220;see a lot of discrimination, and cheating/biased referees, when they travel into predominantly white areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyner, a member of the NAACP&rsquo;s Philadelphia chapter executive board, said she is continuing to gather support for her allegations and intends to push the issue &#8220;as hard as possible&#8221; with the help of that organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a second-round game last Tuesday, played at Coatesville, MC&S; was thumped by Reading Central Catholic, 83-53, and received as many as seven technical fouls, according to eyewitnesses contacted by the Daily News.</p>
<p>The game was halted with 13.9 seconds remaining when Kwahmere Gredic, the Mighty Elephants&rsquo; point guard and senior captain, whipped the ball high into the stands. It hit no one.</p>
<p>Joyner did not attend, she said, because her principal, Frank Devine, was present to represent the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I&rsquo;ve received so far, both teams were treated equally,&#8221; Cashman [Brad Cashman, executive director of the PIAA] said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see any evidence that shows the charges you&rsquo;re saying [Joyner] is making could be verified.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day after the game, MC&S; coach Danny Jackson said Gredic had received a school suspension, and that he had been told by Joyner he would be barred from coaching for the first few games of the 2010-11 campaign.</p>
<p>Joyner said in an interview neither one was slapped with disciplinary measures. Also, in an overall context, she said she takes great exception to the fact that the Daily News stated that MC&S;&rsquo; program had &#8220;disgraced itself&#8221; during that loss.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As the captain, he was allowed to speak with the referees [about rules interpretations or essential information, per PIAA rules]. He said they ignored him every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyner is particularly angry that one MC&S; player, Thomas Moore, suffered a bloodied lip (while trying to draw a charge) and that another, Gredic, was pushed to the floor en route to the basket. Fouls were not called.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Cashman] added, &#8220;This is the only Philadelphia school that makes these complaints. Our reports are that the conduct of MC&S;&rsquo; coaches, players and fans is OK when they&rsquo;re winning. When they&rsquo;re losing, it becomes unsportsmanlike. Putting it mildly. It was definitely &#8216;unacceptable&rsquo; based on the reports I have so far from last week&rsquo;s game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cashman said the referees&rsquo; reports show that one MC&S; player received back-to-back techs, then an automatic ejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The player] verbally abused a ref to get a tech, then did it again, right away, to get the next tech,&#8221; Cashman reported. &#8220;The referees&rsquo; reports don&rsquo;t indicate the number of techs, but they all resulted from &#8216;obscene language&rsquo; and &#8216;questioning of officials.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Coleman said Joyner submitted to him a letter and DVD of last year&rsquo;s Greenwood loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found there was no room at all to protest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There was one call in the last 30 seconds that could have, even should have, gone the other way. It can&rsquo;t come down to that. They played horrible. Down to the other team&rsquo;s level. Danny and Lonnie [Diggs, MC&S;&rsquo; athletic director and an assistant coach] were fine with not pursuing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diggs stated via text message, &#8220;I just feel many of our inner-city schools haven&rsquo;t gotten a fair shake as far as officiating goes, for whatever reason, in many of the state playoff games held outside of our district vs. suburban teams this year and in years past. Hopefully, it is something that can be brought to light and corrected.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Coleman, who is also African-American, labeled Joyner&rsquo;s charges &#8220;completely unfounded; completely wrong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though I do realize she is entitled to due process.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;I&rsquo;d have to ask Veronica Joyner, &#8216;Does she think Kansas is contacting the NAACP now because they lost to Northern Iowa?&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

		<p>In other words, the refs called a fair and clean game, because they wanted clean basketball without ostentatious exhibitionism that is so typical of black teams.  Blacks think they deserve to win because so many white people have told them that they&rsquo;re better &#8220;afawetes.&#8221;  So if they lose, then some evil must be to blame.</p>
<p>Even if the refs were unfair, the margin of victory was 30 points.  I fail to see how that lead doesn&rsquo;t hold up if you change a few foul calls.  And even if the refs did change the outcome of the game, so what?  It&rsquo;s high school basketball   &mdash;   Presumably, no money is on the line, and its unimportant as housewife gossip in the greater scheme of things.  </p>

		<p>The answer to this is for the suburban school to put the game on the scheduled and just forfeit. don&rsquo;t play. It isn&rsquo;t worth the aggravation. Of course, the blacks will scream bloody murder, but it&rsquo;s for the best. Home or away, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Just don&rsquo;t play black schools.</p>

<p>- - The Blacks play commit these technical fouls because of their own hate for Whites.  They think that they can intimidate Whites with that kind of play and they&rsquo;re so brazen - thinking that they can do anything to Whites and get away with it - that they just do ahead and play that way.  When they get called on these violations they then claim racism.  The more power Blacks get the more this is going to happen.  Incidentally, when All-White schools play all-Black schools the result is usually that the White schools win. </p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t at all unusual taking into consideration that most ALL blacks have the same attitude towards whites as Jeremiah Wright.</p>
<p>All black inadequacies, failures, ineptitudes, and low intellect is blamed on something other than the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my personal belief that blacks are so self-absorbed and arrogant they feel anything that doesn&rsquo;t support their perverted self-image is based in inequality or anything other than the truth.</p>
<p>In addition to that, their complaints are also based in a hatred of whites.  Her comments are unequivocally racist, as they use the term nowadays, and she should be called a racist for spouting such egregious lies.</p>
<p>That she isn&rsquo;t, reveals how spineless whites have become.  They&rsquo;re ready to take unjust criticism lying down and playing dead.</p>

		<p> She sounds like a typical crybaby black, yelling &#8220;Bias!&#8221; and &#8220;Racism!&#8221; whenver she can&rsquo;t get her way. And she never even bothered to attend the game, but she&rsquo;s telling the athletic conference poobahs all these details about what happened during and after the game? Ha! A lawyer would call that &#8220;hearsay evidence,&#8221; which is inadmissable in court. Let&rsquo;s hope the league sticks to its guns on this and tells her to go take a hike.</p>

		<p>Good Lord 30 points?  How do you blame that on the referees?  Could it be the well-known phenomenon of black athletes not &#8220;showing up to play&#8221; so to speak when the game gets rough?  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between Randy Moss and a dollar?</p>
<p>You get 4 quarters out of a dollar.</p>
<p>Randy Moss, Keyshawn Johnson, that nutcase Ochocinco, all known to stop playing when they don&rsquo;t get the ball as often as they&rsquo;d like, when the game gets out of hand.  Keyshawn even wrote a book titled &#8220;Just Throw Me The Damned Ball.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No heart.  Just like these kids.  One trying to get the Academy Award flopped like a fish trying to draw the blocking foul while driving to the basket and was denied.  Same went for the kid who thought he could stand his ground and cause a little white weakling to charge him and crumble.  He got his mouth busted.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this black kid who was the running back on my cousin&rsquo;s peewee football team.  Kid had some talent but after every handoff and 35 yards of running for 4 yards total gain he&rsquo;d lay on the field and writhe for 5 minutes.  Trainers run out, he gets up, back in the game.  Happened every 3rd play.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from a rather dusky neighborhood and could go on all night with these stories because I&rsquo;ve been watching it all my life.  I&rsquo;ve seen them piss and moan and make excuses when they lose and seen some of the most unsportsmanlike disgusting conduct imaginable when they win.  Especially when it&rsquo;s a white private school, that REALLY brings out their best.</p>

		<p>Sounds like this black team got whipped pretty good by the score.</p>
<p>It can be mortally physically dangerous for a white team to beat a black team at a game of basketball.</p>
<p>Back in the early 1960&rsquo;s, some students from Calumet HS [predominantly white], Chi., were STABBED TO DEATH by some persons from Dunbar HS [predominantly black] when the white team beat the black team at a game of basketball.</p>
<p>Those two white students WERE NOT EVEN AT THE GAME, KILLED AFTERWARDS IN RETALIATION!</p>
<p>Flipping a basketball into the stands in the manner as was described could really hurt someone. That &#8220;toss&#8221; was meant to hurt!!</p>

		<p>First of all, congratulations to Reading Central Catholic!<br>
Second, here&rsquo;s where this will go:<br>
The blacks can&rsquo;t possibly lose to whites at basketball and will continue to shout and complain about racism.  The liberal whites will decide it must be racism&hellip;. because blacks said so and we want to show how progressive and understanding we are&hellip; so&hellip;.<br>
the white refs will have to go to diversity training and &#8220;modify&#8221; the interpretation of the rules to allow for &#8220;cultural differences&#8221; (see also thuggish behavior)&hellip;<br>
and some more white students will have their eyes opened when they play against blacks.</p>

		<p>Trash blacks do all they can 24 hours a day to make you guys hate them. Don`t fall into their trap and hate them. Do what they really fear from you,ignore them. Remember if you fall into the trap and start hating them,you will never be able to hate them as much as they hate you. These clowns were dissed and acted like any other gang of thugs. Don`t let your kids play with them.Don`t send your kids to school with them. Arm your kid on his 18th birthday and say the famous words,&#8221; You on your own now kid.&#8221; Race relations improve dramatically including basketball sportsmanship, when you are armed and never see each other.<br>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t unusual for all-black teams to intentionally play &#8220;thug ball&#8221; in any sport, with their fans hollering for more. If the coaches are also black, you can bet the kids are coached to play dirty. That way they can blame any loss on &#8220;the racist honky refs.&#8221; I saw this firsthand in a Pop Warner type football league in west Texas in the early 1980s. That was my first hint that blacks were not &#8220;just regular people.&#8221; The truly sad thing was that the team in question was highly talented and could have easily won while playing by the rules.</p>

		<p>I just realized that whenever a high school&rsquo;s name uses a term like &#8220;math&#8221;, &#8220;science&#8221;, or &#8220;technology&#8221; it means it is a black high school, and the students can&rsquo;t do any of things in the name.</p>

		<p>Naturally we only get the black side of the story on this matter.  I&rsquo;ve noticed that every time blacks get trounced by whites, whether in step dancing or basketball, they whine of racism and discrimination.  This just highlights their arrogant and supremacist attitude towards whites.  They&rsquo;ve been told their whole lives they are superior to whites and when they lose the only explanation is discrimination.</p>
<p>Also, there is a marked difference in rule enforcement between black ghetto schools and white suburban schools.  White schools actually enforce the rules which comes as a shock to blacks when they travel to play them.  Ghetto ball rules like throwing elbows, traveling, moving your pivot foot, more than three seconds in the lane, and trash talking are not allowed.  </p>
