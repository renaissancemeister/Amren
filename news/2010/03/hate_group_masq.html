<h1>&#8216;Hate Group&rsquo; Masquerading As Advocate of Human Rights?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Miele, Daily Inter Lake (Kalispell, Montana), March 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A funny thing happened on the way to this week&rsquo;s column  &mdash;  I got &#8220;targeted,&#8221; &#8220;frozen,&#8221; &#8220;personalized&#8221; and &#8220;polarized.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, I got lumped in with the majority of Americans as the &#8220;radical right&#8221;  &mdash;  you know, the scary people who believe in God, the Constitution, family values, and an honest day&rsquo;s work for an honest day&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Targeting&#8221; the opposition is the tactic made famous by left-wing political theorist Saul Alinsky, who wrote in &#8220;Rules for Radicals,&#8221; that one key route to power is to &#8220;Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the methodology employed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a so-called human-rights group, in a new report called &#8220;Rage on the Right,&#8221; which seeks to convince Americans that &#8220;the anger seething across the American political landscape&#8221; as represented by the Tea Party movement is &#8220;shot through with rich veins of radical ideas, conspiracy theories and racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example of how &#8220;targeting&#8221; works, you have to realize that this SPLC report is allegedly a review of &#8220;The Year in Hate and Extremism,&#8221; but there is not one mention of Islamic extremism included  &mdash;  nothing about the alleged murder of 13 people at Fort Hood by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan; nothing about the Muslim convert who apparently killed a soldier at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark.; nothing about the father who allegedly killed his daughter by ramming her with a car for being &#8220;too Westernized&#8221;; nothing about the founder of a Muslim TV station in Buffalo, N.Y., who was charged with beheading his wife for seeking a divorce; nothing about the murder of a college professor in New York state by his Muslim student, allegedly in revenge for &#8220;persecuted&#8221; Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} We all know that Americans are dangerous, especially when seeking to guarantee their constitutional rights. Among the &#8220;signs of growing radicalization&#8221; that SPLC spokesman Mark Potok notes in his &#8220;Rage on the Right&#8221; report is &#8220;Politicians pandering to the antigovernment right in 37 states [that] have introduced &#8216;Tenth Amendment resolutions,&rsquo; based on the constitutional provision keeping all power not explicitly given the the federal government with the states.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, supporting the Constitution is now considered radical.</p>
<p>So too is quoting the Founding Fathers. As one sign of the growing &#8220;radicalization&#8221; that threatens America, we are told by Potok that armed men have attended speeches by President Obama &#8220;bearing signs suggesting that the &#8216;tree of liberty&rsquo; needs to be &#8216;watered&rsquo; with the &#8216;blood of tyrants.&rsquo; &#8221; What Potok fails to mention is that the source of the quotation is Thomas Jefferson{snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This kind of &#8220;scare tactic&#8221; would be more alarming if it came from a source other than the Southern Poverty Law Center, but that group&rsquo;s credibility has already long since vanished. Even a writer for the left-wing Huffington Post wrote a scathing rebuke of the SPLC for its lack of interest in the Obama administration&rsquo;s decision to drop charges against members of the New Black Panther Party who had tried to intimidate voters in Philadelphia in 2008.</p>
<p>Carol M. Swain wrote last year that, &#8220;The SPLC has been mum on the issue, despite the fact that in 2000, it included the New Black Panther Party among its annual list of hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nor is Swain a voice on the right who can be marginalized as yet another neo-Nazi racist by the Southern Poverty Law Center. She is a black woman who is a professor of political science and law at Vanderbilt University, and has written a book entitled &#8220;The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet from her vantage point as an expert on race relations, she has no trouble seeing through the polarizing tactics of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Her summation is the best final word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than monitoring hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has become one.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Good to see someone besides AmRen bloggers &#8220;target&#8221; and &#8220;freeze&#8221; the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is exactly what Frank Miele said it was. As I&rsquo;ve suggested on here before, the best thing that its &#8220;targets&#8221; could do, is start suing it every time it tries to libel them with one of its &#8220;hate group&#8221; labelings. Even if the targeted group lost the lawsuit, it would be forcing the SPLC to expend its money on legal fees, and spend its time defending its actions instead of continuing to operate as a meat-ax terrorist benefiting the Left. </p>

		<p>During the second half of Sam Dickson&rsquo;s latest Amren speech, he enumerated some of the &#8220;guilt by association&#8221; tactics used by the SPLC:</p>
<p>If you were born in an area where a known &#8220;hater&#8221; once lived, that means you are &#8220;associated with him&#8221;.<br>
If you made a public speech, and somebody in the audience was a known &#8220;hater&#8221;, that means you are associated with him.<br>
If you are quoted by a known &#8220;hater&#8221;, that means you are associated with him.</p>
<p>For the record, according to the SPLC, loving your own people makes you a &#8220;hater&#8221;!  Those people truly are a bunch of hysterical hate-mongers.</p>

		<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is anything buy Southern.  It has nothing to do with poverty, and very little to do with law.  It is run by people whose goal it is to destroy White Christian Civilization both here in the Western Hemisphere and everywhere else.  It operates much like the ADL and the two may even work in tandem.  We have to realize that the more we become aware of just who the folks are that are behind the efforts at our destruction, the more they will attempt to put us down any way that they can.  They will violate the law for their own benefit.  They will lie.  They will do anything that they can and that is a great deal because they are extremely well-funded by the people who support what they are and what they do.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no respect for any commentator or so-called journalist who goes to a group so obviously hateful and corrupt as the SPLC in order to get an opinion on hate groups&hellip;or anything else for that matter.</p>
<p>Only an out-of-touch, gullible fool, without any kind of analytical or perceptive abilities, would be taken in by this crowd of oddballs, flakes and misfits.</p>
<p>That the SPLC fails to highlight any of the jihadist groups now training in this country, the Black Panthers, La Raza, Aztlan, plus numerous others, tells us all we need to know about their lack of objectivity.</p>
<p>Show me someone who believes anything the SPLC prints or sermonizes, and I&rsquo;ll show you a fool.</p>

<p>Laughably, if white, this is what we have been abhorrently reduced to in the USA: Zero Mostel&rsquo;s character Pseudolus in: &ldquo; A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only men or women in the &ldquo;Forum,&rdquo; who know that they do all the work intelligently, and get a contemptuous rejoinder as their only rewards, wearily sing of both that comedy and tragedy today!</p>
<p>I could end this sarcastically, with my usual glib: God help us all&hellip;but this time I will not; or at least, not yet!!!</p>
<p>Or better put, before I do it, I would like to review this except from the above article by Dr. Carol M. Swain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather than monitoring hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has become one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SPLC is and always has been, not a &ldquo;hate group,&rdquo; as that term holds some dignity to it when judged through the absurd definition as imposed by the SPLC and their fellow travelers, but it is a violently Red terrorist collective. It has no purpose other than the genocide of the white race and the total destruction of Western Civilization; in other words, it is the genocidal radical, bipedal pig&rsquo;s pen, on the Animal Farm!!!!</p>
<p>And with that noted:</p>

		<p>So the SPLC has overreached itself, to the point at which even the controlled governmedia have begun to notice.  That&rsquo;s encouraging, but I have little doubt that the leftist propaganda outlets will simply find another source for juicy quotes with which to smear White people.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;Rather than monitoring hate groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center has become one.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>No, Carol, the SPLC has <i>always</i> been a Hate Group.<br>

		<p>Having been on the receiving end of Morris,  Heidi and Mark&rsquo;s attempts at character assasination several years ago now I can only suggest that their greatest contribution to society is in proving that their hoodwinked supporters are precisely what P.T.

		<p>The SPLC has indeed become a hate group itself.  It pre-sorts &#8220;crimes&#8221; to make sure that only right-wing &#8220;culprits&#8221; are left in the spotlight to scare their lily-livered lefty contributors into scratching more checks to the overly-flush SPLC!!

		<p>There is a serious question how popular deep-down SPLC is with<br>
many of the persons within the FBI, ATF, etc. One of the most<br>
abject of failures within law enforcement is to fail to harness and control an informant and to end up as an unwitting tool of the informant.  In essence there is little distinction to be made in this regard between a smart local criminal psychopath<br>
who gets the upper hand over a detective and a half a billion dollar informant entity that gets an upper hand over much of federal law enforcement.  It is not a remote possibility that about the time Dees feels he&rsquo;s consolidated his powers, he finds himself confronted with a multiple count arrest warrant (say, under RICO provisions ? )</p>

		<p>It has been painful to watch the SPLC hop into the immigration business.  Like any good investors, they need to go where the growth is.  Their ham handed attempts to tar anyone who opposes our current immigration system has exposed them as the smear merchants that they are.

<p>Here, here.  </p>
<p>In the mid nineties the SPLC was bad mouthing the militias unmercifully, not because they constituted a threat to the country&hellip;because they did not&hellip;.but because they were a group of white people with real power that united under the cause of self-defense, and that tenent posed a threat to the SPLC agenda of promoting tribal fractiousness which they believe is necessary<br>
to assure no white group can create a kind of nationalism in this country.  White nationalism, they believe, is their greatest enemy, and they fanatically perceive it to be a threat at every turn and behind every tree.  They believe it is absolutely vital that they reduce the power of the white structure in this country any way possible.  They&rsquo;ve become even worse now than they were then.  The organization is rife with unmitigated hate.</p>
<p>As a member of a militia at that time, I wrote the SPLC and sent them certfied letters regarding my intent to file a cause of action against the SPLC and personal legal action against any individual working for them if they libeled or defamed me by association in any way.  At the same time I began searching the statutes to find a tort that would fit the charges.</p>
<p>I intend to do the same right now the first time any of them utters or writes anything that unequivally slanders or libels me by association.</p>
<p>I would encourage EVERYBODY who feels as I do to do the same.  </p>
<p>Mr. Engle is right.  The SPLC would spend a lot of their dwindling funds fighting individuals.  The amount of time involved for them would probably be more than they can handle right now.  The very least it would do is shut them up.<br>

		<p>Not only has the SPLC always been a hatred hustle, the MSM has always known it.  It&rsquo;s their job to know their sources, their job to dig out the truth, their job to know how to get information.  If they don&rsquo;t do their job, it&rsquo;s because they have chosen not to.  The SPLC is the media&rsquo;s own pit bull.  </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Ranger, it is not merely commentators and journalists who use $PLC as a source of information.  The FBI takes their fabricated &#8220;intelligence&#8221; at face value and uses it in investigations and prosecutions.</p>
<p>A rash of libel lawsuits against this private, for-profit (really, is Dees doing this for free?) spy agency would be ideal.</p>

		<p>12 Anonymous:  About ten years ago, a Ph.D. candidate at George Mason University was doing his dissertation about paranoia-industrial complex groups like the ADL and SPLC.  The reason I know about it is that he called CofCC officials wanting to know their responses to his interviews with Mark Potok and a few ADL regional big wigs.  I don&rsquo;t know if his thesis was ever published, or if it was good enough to get him his doctorate, but his theory was that there is a tacit understanding, a quid pro quo, between the two:  The FBI et al. use the ADL and SPLC to get information in ways that are illegal for the FBI, spying and voyeurism, and the FBI pays them back by having its informants/stool pidegons, or sometimes even its agents, dress up in funny uniforms and mouth off about crime and insurrection.  (E.g. Hal Turner, and many others.)  The reason for that is for the ADL and SPLC to have &#8220;threats&#8221; so they can raise money.</p>
<p>One big problem for the ADL and SPLC that has developed in the last year and a half?  One word:  Madoff.  A lot of people that give to the ADL and SPLC were hurt in the Madoff scandal, so they don&rsquo;t have it to give like they used to.  Therefore, the ADL and SPLC are getting increasingly desperate for enemies.</p>

		<p>Re post  #18 (Question of Diversity)<br>
I don&rsquo;t dispute what you say.  I think &#8220;all of the above&#8221; <br>
captures some of the variety and complexity of relationships<br>
with various FBI Field Offices and SPLC.  Yes, the excessive restraints placed on FBI and other fedral agencies back when Congress got into investigations of  COINTELPRO opened the door very wide for just what you point to.  But cooperation and communication among &#8220;law&#8221; enforcement entities is a delicate and complicated matter, and there is indication that SPLC rubs many people in the FBI the wrong way. <br>
Basically, there&rsquo;s no enduring way for a trained law enforcement entity to get involved with an outfit like SPLC without lots of<br>
friction and heat being generated within the law enforcement entity as a result of the asymmetrical relationship.  I have little doubt that under the vast roof of the FBI, there is amassed at places  very thoroughly and very carefully definitive information about the &#8220;con&#8221; games and the &#8220;cointelpro&#8221; variants<br>
that are at work within SPLC, as well as features of the private lives of some of the luminaries, certainly not excluding Dee$ him$elf.  $PLC has a very very corrupting influences upon local law enforcement.  Brighter executives within local and regional law enforcement can see that ultimately their relationships with SPLC turn from gravy into mud.  But brains are not that abundant, and in the meantime it is very attractive to be investigating &#8220;thought crimes&#8221; that thus do not entail the standards of actual work involved getting a basis for an actual arrest or a basis for actual prosecution.  The big problem for SPLC is that they get to quarterbacking local dummies in &#8220;understanding&#8221; suspects whose reading material and writings the dummies can not understand.  Among folks who catch on quickest to what is happening are some librarians and, of course, some local lawyers.  A good many lawyers view the basic<br>
SPLC &#8220;abuse of legal process&#8221; with a good bit of practical hostility. They are correct in noting that over time &#8220;using&#8221;<br>
the Courts to punish thoughts and attitudes is going to make the <br>
legal system less and less congenial to the demands of everyday justice  &mdash;  in short, it messes with the &#8220;milk cow&#8221; that feeds the lawyers.  Focusing on the aversive impacts of SPLC upon The Establishment  is more productive than focusing upon the mere violation of indiviudal rights of expression or assembly.     </p>

		<p>A very practical problem for SPLC is the amount of local law enforcement  money it siphons away from genuine local purposes.<br>
It costs as much as $14 a minute  &mdash;  a minute  &mdash;  to keep a local law enforcement officer on duty. The fact that he or she gets only a thin sliver of that amount for salary should not obscure what&rsquo;s at issue.  A practical objection to &#8220;thought policing&#8221; is how <br>
much resources are diverted from plain old vanilla issues of<br>
odometer tampering, breaking and entering, pushing meth near the middle schools, bid rigging, chop-shops, armed robbery, traffic problems, etc   </p>

		<p>Of all the groups the SPLC has criticized lately, the one that baffles me the most is the Oath Keepers. A police organization that promises to disobey unlawful infringements of civil liberties, for example herding people into internment camps at gunpoint during an emergency, real or imagined. Considering the demographics of the SPLC&rsquo;s leadership and much of it&rsquo;s donor base, I would think that they of all people would support this wholeheartedly. Especialy when they spent the last eight years (rightfully) criticizing the Bush administration&rsquo;s infringements on civil liberties.</p>
<p>Instead, they have chosen to sensationalize a problem that barely exists, and carry the banner of a centralized state, so long as a guy they like is in charge. Apparently they have never heard the story of the boy who cried wolf.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s worse than that, O&rsquo;Reilly AGREES with Potok and the SPLC.  Glenn Beck is another one on Fox that&rsquo;s been moving left over time, and it won&rsquo;t be long before he&rsquo;s on the SPLC bandwagon, too.  Then again, I saw through O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s act a long time ago.  If you remember, O&rsquo;Reilly used to host one of those national syndicated gossip shows that was either on Channel 2 or 5 in STL.  O&rsquo;Reilly goes where the wind will take him.</p>

		<p>overwhelm SPLC with useless emails&hellip;send &#8220;bill me later&#8221; magazine subscriptions with SPLC&rsquo;s address on them&hellip;send them false &#8220;racist&#8221; complaints with your Mother-in-Laws address attached to them&hellip;do stuff like this.</p>

		<p>With regard to Post 17  &mdash;  Michael C. Scott<br>
One very immediate way to clip with wings of SPLC is to catch<br>
on to how they &#8220;cookie cut&#8221; &#8220;cherry pick&#8221; &#8220;gerrymander&#8221; information.  If relevant facts omitted are juxtaposed to their<br>
&#8220;intelligence&#8221; files, the manipulaive, $elf $serving contriances at work become starkly evident.  Law enforcement does have a keen eye to distinguishing between its being &#8220;fed&#8221; and its being genuinely &#8220;informed&#8221;.  Possibly the internet now affords invidiuals a tasteful and rational basis of making known the full range of relevant facts about some apect of their lawful political conduct?  That could be a huge disincentive to law enforcement gullibility vis a vis $PLC.  Also, the federal Privacy Act ought to provide for inserting corrective or complementary information into files held under one&rsquo;s name.  Dees&rsquo; organization has certain analogy to some of the shallower aspects of human sexuality.  At first a &#8220;relationship&#8221; with SPLC by a law enforcement entity is exciting and mutually enhancing. But before long it plays itself out and betrays the lack of sustained compatibility and then becomes increasingly aversive.  SPLC is probably in phases two and three of this process.  Let&rsquo;s help it all ripen.  </p>

Or, perhaps, where the money is?   SPLC is said, after all, to be very rich.   Hmmm.<br>
