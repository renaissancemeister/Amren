<h1>Malema &#8216;Fan&rsquo; Counts Dead &#8216;Boere&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DaniÃ«lla du Plooy, News24 (Cape Town), March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Julius Malema&rsquo;s supporters is placing &#8220;updates&#8221; of farm murders on a Facebook page in the ANC Youth League leader&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>On Monday the FF+ [Freedom Front Plus] warned that the ANC youth leader&rsquo;s controversial song &#8220;Shoot the boers, they are rapists&#8221; could incite farm murders.</p>
<p>Malema&rsquo;s Facebook page has over 12 000 fans. One of them, Clearence Letlonkane, has been posting information about farmers being murdered, as reported on news websites, every few hours over the past few days.</p>
<p>One of these updates reads: &#8220;3 000 farmers dead since &rsquo;94 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we lost more people than that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we r far from being even .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So kill da boer, kill da farmer.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Corruption</b></p>
<p>Another one of his posts states: &#8220;They kept the wealth of our land .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the little riches obtained is not merly (sic) enough to be shared equally amongst all of us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hence it is that corruption persists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Crime will not rest until all that was stolen 4rm us is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all regained .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Letlonkane also writes that &#8220;eight people have been murdered on farms in Limpopo since the beginning of February&#8221;.</p>
<p>When questioned about this, he commented as follows: &#8220;I haven&rsquo;t killed anyone, but I am not sympathetic to those who have been murdered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sue me for not shedding a tear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malema is not necessarily the creator or even involved with the page.</p>
<p><b>Hate speech</b></p>
<p>Ernst Roets, national chair of AfriForum Youth, has indicated that they will use the Facebook posts as evidence during the hate speech case against Malema which they&rsquo;ve submitted to the equality court.</p>
<p>Anton Alberts, the FF+&rsquo;s parliamentary spokesperson for economics, said in a statement on Monday that &#8220;one doesn&rsquo;t have to give the matter much thought to realise that Malema&rsquo;s utterances are creating an atmosphere which is beneficial to those who want to murder&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FF+ will do its part to stop this scourge in the political and legal arenas. The farming community will have to start protesting publically against the murders and the lack of a commando system. Afrikaners should start learning to toyi-toyi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Floyd Shivambu, spokesperson for the ANC Youth League, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, but on Wednesday told News24 the ANC Youth League had nothing to do with the Facebook page. &#8220;People have always written nonsense on Facebook. We have complained in the past and it is very sad that people would use the name of Julius Malema for hate speech,&#8221; said Shivambu.</p>
<p>He said another Malema fan page had been removed from the social networking site after it had been found to contain hate speech.</p>
<p>Asked whether he saw any connection between Malema&rsquo;s singing of a song calling for the killing of &#8220;boers&#8221; and Letlonkane&rsquo;s posts, he said there was none.</p>
<p><b>March through Johannesburg</b></p>
<p>AfriForum Youth is organising a march in Johannesburg on Friday to protest against Malema&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>According to Roets, the court case is &#8220;an important priority, but it is also necessary for the public to make it clear that the behaviour of Malema and the youth league will no longer be tolerated&#8221;.</p>
<p>A letter of grievances and a list of over 1 600 farm murders will be handed to the ANC Youth League during the protest march. Those who have been affected by farm murders will also participate in the march.</p>
<p>According to Roets, the protest will be &#8220;legal, peaceful and orderly&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The impression created by this protest will be in direct contrast to the ANC Youth League and Malema&rsquo;s irresponsible actions. Buses from Pretoria have been arranged and placards with slogans will be supplied.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Can anyone say &#8220;rule of law&#8221;? Would this be tolerated in the United States, even if Mr. Letlonkane were black? (we all know it would not be tolerated were he white)</p>

		<p>The blacks say that over 3,000 farmers have been killed. This is the truth, but this is for farmers alone. In total over 50,000 whites have been murdered by blacks since 1994. </p>
<p>One of the biggest lies the blacks tell themselves is that the whites killed a lot of them during apartheid. The ANC controlled &#8220;truth and reconciliation committee&#8221; was created to investigate how many blacks died at the hands of whites during apartheid.<br>
The TRC asked every single black who had a friend or family member that went missing during the apartheid years to come forwards.</p>
<p>Wherever possible the blame was then allocated to the apartheid government. Even when the missing person might have gone missing due to black crime.  </p>
<p>Even then the TRc could only blame the apartheid government for 7,000 deaths over a period of 42 years.</p>
<p>Hard to belief isn&rsquo;t it, given the hysteria and all the propaganda.</p>
<p>Here see for yourself. This is one the official reports from the TRC.<br>

<p>7,000 thousand deaths during the time of Apartheid rule between 1948 and 1990. Notice how the deaths shot up once Mandela was releases in 1990.<br>

<p>Sadly, you are correct Afrikaner. My country has a 100% record of supporting the wrong people in various governments or coups. We failed miserably by failing Ho Chi Minh, Mao Tse Tung and a host of others and all got us into political and military quagmires from which we have never recovered. Your country is but among the latest but not the most recent. I suspect the Afghan and Iraqi governments will be added to the hall of shame.<br>

		<p>It pains me to see such hate speech, especially amongst us the youth of RSA&hellip;.<br>
Why are we so bitter? Have we not grown passed this. It seems to me as if we want revenage, why? I have lived in what most people call a &#8216;Boer Town&rsquo; Lichtenburg for almost my entire live. I find Letlokane&rsquo;s comments to be down right racist and quite immature. Where is the humanity bra? You are no better then those killers themselves</p>

		<p>The South African tourist authorities used to promote their beautiful country as &#8220;The World in Miniture&#8221;<br>
Many years on in a much more fallen world, perhaps that statement has more truth in it than we will evr know.<br>
It is a small nation where the non-whites outnumber the white 10 to 1. Just like the ratio for the rest of the planet.<br>
As in S A the non-whites are out to destroy what remains of white western civilization.<br>
One would need to be blind not to see that America could be the next victim.<br>
Obama goes to the White House in a bullet proof limo or helicopter, perhaps he should travel there in a wooden horse from time to time.<br>

		<p>First of all - murder is murder, be it by the hand of black people or white people, it is still wrong and only when we as South Africans stand together will we be able to put an end to innocent people of all races and colours loosing their lives.</p>
<p>It all comes down to education. If everyone had a decent education, no one will follow an individual like Julius Malema who knows that what he says (even if meant figuratively will be literally interpreted by the masses) is down right wrong and filled with hate speech. We need to move forward and I personally feel that unless we make peace with the past and focus only on the future will we be able to heal and grow together as one, a nation of diversity and where colour is just that, a colour not a way to be stereotyped or labeled by.</p>
