			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Scott, Essence, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>My new friend is handsome, African-American, intelligent and seemingly wealthy. He is an athlete, loves his momma, and is happily married to a White woman. I admit when I saw his wedding ring, I privately hoped. But something in me just knew he didn&rsquo;t marry a sister. Although my guess hit the mark, when my friend told me his wife was indeed Caucasian, I felt my spirit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wince. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When our people were enslaved, &#8220;Massa&#8221; placed his Caucasian woman on a pedestal. She was spoiled, revered and angelic, while the Black slave woman was overworked, beaten, raped and farmed out like cattle to be mated. She was nothing and neither was our Black man. As slavery died for the greater good of America, and the movement for equality sputtered to life, the White woman was on the cover of every American magazine. {snip} She was unequivocally the standard of beauty for this country, firmly unattainable to anyone not of her race. We daughters of the dust were seen as ugly, nappy mammies, good for day work and unwanted children, while our men were thought to be thieving, sex-hungry animals with limited brain capacity.</p>
<p>We reflect on this awful past and recall that if a Black man even looked at a White woman, he would have been lynched, beaten, jailed or shot to death. In the midst of this, Black women and Black men struggled together, mourned together, starved together, braved the hoses and vicious police dogs and died untimely on southern back roads together. These harsh truths lead to what we really feel when we see a seemingly together brother with a Caucasian woman and their children. That feeling is betrayed. {snip}</p>

<p>Endless theories and speculation just to avoid the obvious; men, white and black, find white women more attractive (and less confrontational) than black women.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to reach back in time to find a reason that isn&rsquo;t there. No black man today looks at a black woman through the lens of slavery.</p>
<p>These theories grow increasing convoluted as they do absurd.</p>

<p>- - In lieu of the last 50 years since the beginning of the so-called &#8220;civil-rights movement&#8221; in which time more Whites have been murdered by Blacks than all the soldiers who died in the Viet Nam War; in lieu of the 35,000+ rapes of White women by Black men each year in the U.S. - do we really wonder why?</p>

		<p>This is the kind of thinking we need to encourage amongst all races.  It should make members of every race wince to think of one of their own marrying outside of racial boundaries. Our racial kinsmen can only benefit from furthering this mindset amongst others.</p>

		<p>Whoever is seeing hot white women w/ black men really needs to stop watching so much TV!</p>
<p>While I do not condone &ldquo;mixin&rsquo; it up&rdquo;, I am not so weak that I wince at the sight of a white woman w/ a black man. That is because 99% of these women had very low self esteem in the first place to stoop so low (i.e., obesity, drug addiction, stretch pants). Do white men really see white women with black men they would rather have for themselves? Not me. About 3 or 4% of these women look alright and about 1% actually look good. I suspect there is something we are not seeing with the later 1% (STDs, out-of-wedlock kids, low intelligence).</p>
<p>Basically, the white women who date black men are demographically similar in intelligence, STDs, divorce, child birth, attitude and many other areas, to the black women who date black men. If the black man and oriental woman wants to take out our genetic trash, let them!<br>

		<p>this is an area I can definetly agree with black nationalists on.  Black men should be with black women, white men with white women, and everything will be fine.  Is that okay if I, a gentile white man, says that?  Or do I have to be a non-white to say that and not get in trouble?</p>

		<p>She is absolutely correct that black women should not be held to the same standard of beauty as white women. Black women have their own unique beauty and charm that is different from the other races. The best way for them to be appreciated is to live within their own nation that supports their unique culture. Integration means that they will always be competing as minorities against the dominant majority culture&rsquo;s standard of beauty. Unfortunately, black women will continue to be treated poorly by black men unless there is some kind of separation between the races. I honestly feel for black women, they have almost always treated me (personally) very well. I feel very sorry for how they are being treated by their own kind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We reflect on this awful past and recall that if a Black man even looked at a White woman, he would have been lynched, beaten, jailed or shot to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. Jack Johnson - the overrated Great Black Dope who was thrashed by journeyman white boxer Jess Willard - openly ran a  prostitution ring in the early 1900s and he was not lynched. Of course, any man who raped a woman risked being lynched in early rural America as there were no police stations to run to for justice. Yes, blacks were more likely to be lynched but they were also more likely to rob, rape and murder (just like today).</p>
<p>I live in an affluent area in northern Virginia with quite a few East Asians, Asian Indians, Middle Easterners and Hispanics. There are mercifully few blacks but many find their way to the local mall.</p>
<p>Over half the black males at the mall are with non-black women. Almost no black women are with non-black men (save an occasional young white guy with a young black girl).</p>
<p>So I can understand the hate and racism of black women like &#8220;Jilted&#8221; Jill Scott.</p>
<p>Whites, Asians, Indians and even Hispanics seem to be dating, socializing and intermarrying at a high rate (I know many on here don&rsquo;t like this but it is just a fact around here). So black women understandably feel left out.</p>
<p>But why blame whitey? Black males also lust after Asians, Hispanics and other non-black, non-white women. Why not hate on them too? Indeed, none of these males become involved with black woman but at least a few white males do.</p>
<p>Of course, whitey will always be blamed for this (and every other black failing). But as America becomes more diverse there will be more and more non-black females for black men to pursue - and the difference will not be made up by non-black, non-white men. </p>
<p>So black women can - and will - keep blaming us for their romantic shortcomings. But that bone-deep, stewing, churning hatred they feel for black men and the non-black &#8220;partners&#8221; they pursue will be less and less salved by blaming whitey as they view as many black men with non-white, non-black women.</p>

		<p>If you read Jill Scott&rsquo;s wiki page there are a few enlightening items.</p>
<p>1. She has been jilted by at least two black men. I can imagine they left her for a non-black woman.</p>
<p>2. She has an HBO series called &#8220;No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t expect her to get the Michael Richards treatment however.</p>
<p>3. She is set to star in two movies and a future episode of Law &amp; Order. She is black so she will not lose here career for her racism.</p>
<p>4. Some of her songs are hilariously titled: <br>
&#8220;He Loves Me (Lyzel In E Flat)&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Beautifully Human&#8221;<br>
And - ironically enough - &#8220;Hate On Me.&#8221;</p>

<p> - - And that is the answer.  These Blacks love, simply love taking the White Man&rsquo;s woman away from him.  It gives them plenty of satisfaction to do so.  We must ask ourselves why this is occurring.  Women make the choice, we have to realize this, and if they didn&rsquo;t choose to miscegenate, then Blacks couldn&rsquo;t date or marry them - period.  Of course, White women&rsquo;s attitudes have had half a century of conditioning by the media with movies like - &#8216;To Sir With Love&rsquo;, &#8216;Jungle Fever&rsquo;, and whole lot of other movies, books, TV shows, articles and advertising.  </p>

And the troubles may not end there. He/she may lose his/her job. If a White public official would say anything along the lines of what Jill Scott said, his/her days in office have ended. Whites are supposed to celebrate inter-racial marriage and/or romance, while blacks are allowed to condemn it in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221; or &#8220;racial pride.&#8221; Calling that a double standard understates the case.  </p>

		<p>Unfortunately we cant blame all of it on the black male. I, as a single male who frequents nightclubs on saturday night witness the horrors of hundreds of pretty white girls who treat these blacks as gods. I go to an upscale very large primarily white nightclub ( at least used to be white) that has probably a thousand or more patrons every sat night. Opens at 10 pm. At exactly about 11.30 about 50-75 brothers strut in and have the first choice of the white girls. These white girls are all over the brothers, dirty dancing and kissing in public. Many of them leave with the bros. The bros are way more aggressive than the white boys. The young white boys are second choice. Diversity/multiculturalism has been a great success with college age girls. My own 22yo niece as far as I know has not gone with the bros but can see nothing wrong with it. I try to talk to her but get fussed at because I am a racist. <br>
  I really cant blame the bros for prefering the white girls over the loudmouthed ugly nappy sisters. Somehow we have to realize that the white girls have not been taught anything but that race does not matter, and anybody who tries to say otherwise is an ignorant racist and at some point may be jailed for this opinion. The white race is lost when we lose our young girls. I dont know the true percentage, but a good percentage, maybe even 20-25% of the w girls in my area have bama babies. Its so sad and somebody needs to formulate a strategy to teach our girls right from wrong to save our race. <br>
  A  couple of other points to make,,,first its only the bros they are with, hardly ever see a white girl with a mexican, aisan, or arab type. Secondly,, our young white boys are not a problem as its rare to see a white boy out with a black girl, in fact I beleive that black girls simply are not attractive to white men. At least not to me&hellip;.   kingfish    </p>

		<p>&#8220;We reflect on this awful past and recall that if a Black man even looked at a White woman, he would have been lynched, beaten, jailed or shot to death.&#8221;</p>
<p> This is deceitful hyperbole. Blacks and whites mixed so freely in the old Jim Crow South that most Yankees would have been shocked by the closeness of the races. Were blacks unjustly lynched? Of course, some were, but their numbers have been exaggerated and used to paint a false picture for black sympathy and current political advantage.</p>

Oh really? Freedom Of Association?  ONLY Whites are the ones NOT allowed to live among their own or associate with their own, or promote their own general welfare or to defend their own race! Have you not noticed DE-segregation being shoved down our collective throats through FORCE and LAW? MISCEGENATION is the genocide of the races that practice it and with Whites only 8% of the TOTAL world population(that leaves 92% of a NON-White population)!!!then I would say WE are the ones being genocided!</p>

		<p>First, to &#8220;Kingfish&#8221;, why would you want to go to a night club where blacks hang out? The white women there are whores. Back in the 70&rsquo;s or early 80&rsquo;s I remember reading an article in the Omaha paper about a group of black coeds at the Un. of Nebr. who had to form their own social network in order to have any social life. The black guys on campus didn&rsquo;t want to date them{prefered white gitls} and the white guys didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with the black coeds. I would also suggest that everybody read the original article and then read the comments, especially from some of the white women. Then google, &#8220;why black men date white women&#8221; read some of the articles and comments. Some of them are unbelievable, especially from white women. What the hell is wrong with them. One article is written by a women and is printed I believe in the NY Times, and she talks about how soft a black man&rsquo;s skin is, like soft velvet. That she wants to date only black men because they treat her like a lady. Try telling that to Channon Christian. These articles are enough to make me puke.</p>

<p>For those of you don&rsquo;t appreciate the fine offerings of black cinema Jill Scott is always plays fat, unattractive friend of the main character on those Tyler Perry, black man in a fat lady suit type movies. </p>
<p>With her large flared nostrils, hefty girth and whatnot, she is not sexually desirable in under &#8220;conventional&#8221; standards of beauty and has little prospect of dating outside her race, so the sting of losing her pro athlete black super hunk to a white Jezebel must be especially painful.<br>

<p>I think you are probably the exception. I only see the white male-black female pairing about once or twice a year. It&rsquo;s so rare that I usually have to keep myself from staring, since the coupling is such an oddity. I wish I could say the black male-white female pairing was nearly as rare. I suspect local conditions and cultures are really at play here. What is common and acceptable in one city may be rare and largely unacceptable or undesirable in most other cities.</p>
<p>I have, however, seen an increase (not huge, but noticeable) in the number of white men-Hispanic women pairings. That kind of surprised me a little. I hope it&rsquo;s not a nationwide trend.<br>

 I agree with you 100% that people should have freedom of association and choice. This is what is stated in the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, give people freedoms to choose who they<br>
want to be with. Now, personally, i prefer black and hispanic women; however, that&rsquo;s not because of race, it&rsquo;s because of pref<br>
-erence. Yet, if a person wants to date outside their race them <br>
give them that alternative in peace. That&rsquo;s not being judgemental<br>
. <br>
  Now, whites are 15% of the world pop. not 8%, please Anon. be in touch with reality. You need to end the paranoia that whites a<br>

<p>Yes, I see the same thing all the time.  It seems every other black man I see has a blond (it&rsquo;s always a blond) white girl on his arm.  Makes you think about those predictions about blonds going extinct in 2 centuries.  </p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, the under 25 crowd of white girls is totally into the idea of having a black guy.  They have an absolute dream-like conception of this large, muscular take-charge man ravishing them.  (Funny how these feminist-leaning girls want a savage example of masculinity to &#8216;take them&rsquo; and be in charge - as long as he&rsquo;s not white.  They think they can tame the wild men.  Oh well, more baby-mommas to add to the hood.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why many white men are forced to find Asian or Latina wives or girlfriends - many of the best white girls are going black and no one wants them back.  Also the overwhelming majority of white men will not date or marry black women.  With the Asian or Latina, skin color is not usually an issue.</p>
<p>Where I live, there are literally almost no white girls anywhere that aren&rsquo;t already with black guys.  Many are with these dinky, little uneducated illegal immigrant latinos.  (I am not joking - they have status over them in the relationship and they aren ot afraid to say it.)  I found a whitish-looking Asian woman and my kids look 100% white American on account of it.</p>

<p>So, are they with blacks or latinos?  These two sentences seem contradictory.  Where do you live?  Inside TV Land?  At most 5-10% of white girls where I live are with black men.  And most of these girls are not the type you would want to be in a relationship with regardless of their dating history.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Jane&#8221; made the comment that she sees more and more white male/black female couples.I have certainly not seen that. In fact in the town I live in there are more black men married to or living with white women than black males with black females. Can you imagine if there was a town where the number of white men with black females outnumbered white men with white women???? It would never happen. In this town I am in, I have never seen a white guy with a black woman, and in fact have only seen two black men with black women. But countless times I see black males with white females. Black people are so hypocritical. They call themselves &#8220;brotha and sista&#8221; but can&rsquo;t stand the sight of themselves. The question is, do white girls go out with black men because they don&rsquo;t want to be called racist? Or is it the images they see from rap music and videos, MTV, VH1, BET, and in the print media. Ever notice those promos for spring break and it is always a bunch of white coeds in front of a stage with some rapper thugs spewing out profanity. White girls are so clueless. They don&rsquo;t know or care that black men are using them. Makes you wonder what their parents think when they send them off to some major college. Is my daughter going to come home for vacation with some black thug?</p>

		<p>To the Omaha poster&hellip;.as a new arrival in the town, I can say I&rsquo;m shocked and dismayed at the staggering level of black male/white female pairings across all social strata.  The only thing more horrible than seeing the frequency of the pairing is the smug appearance of these females and the fact that most of the replacement populace that results from such unions, i.e. mulattos are already thoroughly overrepresented in this town.</p>

<p>Like you I have seen a notable increase of White men/Black women relationships over the past several years as opposed to the reverse which used to be overwhelmingly the case. They tend to be more upscale and professional as opposed to the lower income Black men/White female couples. In fact, I have seen at least several in the past three months in local upscale bistros.  What is more troubling is that these are the better type of White men.</p>
<p>It is hapenning which much more frequency than in the past. Especially in the 40 and younger crowd. One reason probably being that a number of professional Black women have begun to give up on Black men. Secondly so may of our young White kids have been brainwashed into believng that miscegenaton is &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;progressive&#8221; by the sick, twisted media.</p>

		<p>to poster 52 who calls Jay a hippocrite.  I am with Jay here.  You are not seeing the big picture. When even 10%, and I think the actual number is closer to 20% of the girls of childbearing age go with the blacks and have bama babies, there leaves a shortage of girls for the white boys. I personally know of many many single young and not so young guys who havnt had a date in a long time. So what are we to do, waste the reproduction of decent white boys who would just be sitting home alone on sat night or sancion them in finding the white latinos or aisan girls as Jay has done and reproduce smart white racially aware kids vs just having them hook up with black girls and having more bama babies. Any and all races are better than having mor bama babies&hellip;&hellip; Jay, and lots of others have the rights to happiness and children also. I have a latino girlfreind who is as white as I am and nobody here would assume she is anything other than a pretty white girl if you saw her in the street. Total euro look,and she is sweet and nice also. I live in Colombia 3 months a year and about 10% or so of the population is white, and this 10% owns and runs things, and are educated and worldly in matters of race. Because of the economies of scale and vastly cheaper prices for things, a rich or middle class person there lives far better than a rich or middle class person in the USA. I personally know of several american freinds living good on nothing but S Security. Not possible to live good on SSecurity here. Not to mention the year round good weather. <br>
  Just wanted to stand up for Jay here and all the other lonely white guys because of the lack of available &#8220;good&#8221; girls, the ones who have not gone over to the brothers.  KF  </p>

		<p>Thanks to poster #56 for the defense.  I guess I should have specified, I married an Indo-Pak girl who looks white herself, facial features and all (the original Aryans!)  Not an east Asian.  That&rsquo;s why my kids are Aryan white!  (Raised in American culture, I might add.)</p>
<p>Have you looked at the northern Indian girls lately?  Google them.  A big chunk of them are as white as you and me.  Remember how Alexander the Great&rsquo;s army marched through - they spread the European seed to a population that was already longstanding Aryan.</p>

<p>Are you prejudiced against obese white women? Do you consider them to be less worthy members of the white race than Nicole Brown Simpson and Heidi Klum? Many pro-white women happen to be obese. They are just as white as you are, and are actively involved in advancing the white cause. White women should be judged according to their commitment to the white cause, not according to their looks. What if we used a similar standard with white men, and began looking at obese white men as less worthy members of the white race?<br>
