<h1>U.S. Blacks, Hispanics Losing More Sleep Over Worries</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Nichols, Reuters, March 8, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than whites and Asians to lose sleep over job and money worries, a sleep survey released on Monday found.</p>
<p>The National Sleep Foundation telephone poll of more than 1,000 people from the four ethnic groups also showed that more black Americans are likely to do job related work before bed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black Americans are also more likely to pray and have sex before going to bed and need the least amount of sleep to function, the survey found.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hour before bed is an important time to relax and wind-down before going to sleep,&#8221; says Thomas Balkin, chairman of the National Sleep Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asians report getting the best sleep, having the least amount of sleep problems and the most infrequent use of sleep aids, the poll showed, while whites are more likely to sleep with their pet or partner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites and Asians were more likely than blacks and Hispanics to blame a lack of sleep for harming their job performance, hindering their ability to carry out household duties and care for their family.<br>

		<p>This is a job for the United States Handicapper General and his or her Sleep Equality Federal Agents.  The solution is obvious   &mdash;   force all whites and Asians into sleep deprivation torture jungles.  On the other hand, since the same study shows that blacks and Hispanics have sex more often before sleep, this means that those whites and Asians who will have to endure sleep deprivation will be entitled to a state-provided happy ending.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asians have fewest problems getting to sleep, then whites, then blacks&#8221; </p>
<p>I guess this just fits with the behavioral tendencies that Phillipe Rushton has been writting about for many years now. Asians have higher IQs, are less fertile, less aggressive and have smaller egos(on average)than whites, who in turn hold a (more substantial) lead over blacks when it comes to these things.<br>
Rushton&rsquo;s rule of three! </p>

		<p>Just when you thought that it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse.  Now, we must feel guilty for Blacks and Hispanics not getting as much sleep as Whites.</p>
<p>If White people can&rsquo;t &#8220;wake up&#8221; (no pun intended) to this obvious, blatant, constant pandering to Blacks and Hispanics then God help us all.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, we&rsquo;ll have &#8220;Affirmative Action Sleeping&#8221; where Blacks and Hispanics are allowed to come into work 2 hours later than Whites to make up for the lack of sleep that they are getting.  We&rsquo;ll have Whites show up to work at 8am and Blacks &amp; Hispanics show up at 10am.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh.  It might actually happen.  If you had told me 20 years ago that we would have a Communist, Muslim, half-black President, who wasn&rsquo;t born in America and practiced Black Liberation Theology, I would have laughed at you.  But as we now know, it actually happened.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d infer from this pattern that there is a great deal of difference between stewing &amp; fretting about the next few hours of your life vs. long-term planning.</p>

		<p>  To a certain degree, I can believe they lose more sleep. Hispanics are worrying about ICE catching them and blacks are worrying about their next hit of crack cocaine.</p>

		<p>Several years ago, while stationed in Charleston, SC, I had a apartment just off base. There was a mix of people; lots of military, a bunch of dry wall installers who were illegals from Nicaragua, a few college students and various others. I was a little upset when I was assigned to a night shift job until I realized that my hours were pretty consistent with the illegals who had a tendency to stay up at party, especially after their weekly payday. This also held true for those receiving welfare checks around the beginning of the month. A neighbor downstairs would tell me of police cars arriving regularly between midnight and 3 AM during the first few days of the month. Strangely enough, the apartment complex was kind of a dead zone in the afternoon, you might hear a few kids running around, but that was about it. Considering my hours, this was a blessing in disguise even though the place was about 2 notches above section 8 housing. </p>
<p>I suspect that losing sleep is not really over money or career, but probably things like drugs, booze, &#8220;booty calls&#8221;, and the endless search for the next round of entertainment. </p>

		<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve worked with many blacks, and I can state with absolute certainty that they fall asleep more easily than whites.  I&rsquo;ve actually been in the middle of conversations with people who&rsquo;ve simply nodded off and seen employees sitting erect at their desks, fast alseep.  Even Thomas Jefferson remarked on how much blacks slept.  But, so many of them being chronic complainers, they probably tell pollsters the opposite.</p>

		<p>I would take this poll/survey with a ton of sea salt. If someone call me on the phone to ask me about if I have sex before bed, I would say.. Yes. Every night and every morning. And I am an Asian Male. I seriously doubt this poll is accurate. It supports the stereotypes of each ethnic group. I don&rsquo;t believe it, it&rsquo;s not believable.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d have to say I side with those who think this is a crock. I work with lots of whites and Asians and the majority of both groups here have some sleep problems. As for whites having larger egos than Asians. No, don&rsquo;t think so. And Rushton has not said that either. I like a lot of what Rushton says, but some of it isn&rsquo;t legit, as it is based on self reporting, and that&rsquo;s a no no when it comes to hard science.  Having grown up next door to an Asian family, seeing their kids play piano every day, and then having to hear one of the sons claim at school he hadn&rsquo;t &#8220;played in 5 years&#8221; before sitting down to play at a senior fest, Asians can be as full of bull as anyone else, and they have a definite lean toward self aggrandizement. But what group of non-whites doesn&rsquo;t these days?</p>

		<p>The problem with polls and surveys is how many people did you ask, how many people participated, what were the conditions, and a million other factors.  As the joke goes, 99 percent of statistics are made up</p>

		<p>With all the pimping, sleeping around, drug using, going after whites, and protesting that most blacks do, it&rsquo;s no wonder they would get tired easily.</p>
