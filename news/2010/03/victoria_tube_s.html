<h1>Victoria Tube Stabbing: 35 Schoolchildren in Knife Battle</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin Davenport, Peter Dominiczak and Tim Ross, This Is London, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the middle of Victoria Station during rush hour in a suspected gang fight involving rival schools.</p>
<p>Two groups of up to 35 children, many dressed in school uniforms, are said to have fought a running knife battle in front of hundreds of terrified commuters.</p>
<p>The victim ran into the station in an attempt to escape his attackers but they pursued him inside and he was caught just outside the ticket barriers of the District and Circle lines. The boy was surrounded and stabbed repeatedly. He died in hospital after being tended by police and paramedics.</p>
<p>Police say 20 people, aged between 14 and 17, were arrested at the scene last night and were being questioned this morning but it is not known if the killer or killers are among them. All those arrested were described as of Afro-Caribbean or Somali origin. A number of weapons, including knives, were recovered at the scene.</p>
<p>The victim is believed to come from Acton and was of North African descent. A spokesman for British Transport Police said his relatives had been informed of his death but officers were not yet releasing his name. Senior police chiefs in Westminster held a crisis meeting this morning and transport police said they were deploying extra patrols at Victoria station.</p>
<p>One senior officer said: &#8220;This was a running knife battle at the height of the rush hour. Commuters were absolutely shocked. This brings the whole knife crime issue right into our back yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sources say one theory being investigated was that two groups of children met at Victoria for a planned fight.</p>
<p>The victim was from a school in west London and the other group came from a school in north-west London. One insider said: &#8220;It seems there were about 15 youths from west London and about 20 from north-west London and they converged on Victoria for a reason. Apparently they were prepared for a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Witnesses said the victim was left in the ticket hall lying in a pool of blood in front of hundreds of tourists and commuters. His attackers then fled the station and a number are believed to have tried to escape on buses.</p>
<p>Tube worker Graham Lewis said: &#8220;My colleague who witnessed it said he was basically set upon by a gang of young boys. They were young, some were wearing school uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another staff member said: &#8220;It was awful. I got a call that there had been an incident and ran down the stairs. The first thing I saw was this man lying on the floor in a pool of blood. People were screaming. There were commuters everywhere and they didn&rsquo;t know what to do. People were in a panic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just after he was stabbed about 30 police officers piled into the station. They were there really quickly. The paramedics arrived soon after and they started working on him. They had stripped his upper body because he went into cardiac arrest and they were doing CPR on him. Many of the staff members who saw what happened had to be sent home because they were in shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>One Transport for London ticket office worker, who declined to be named, said : &#8220;My colleague was right there as it unfolded. The boys attacking him couldn&rsquo;t have been any older than him as they were wearing a dark blue school uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victoria station was closed to Tube trains for several hours after the stabbing. A large area of the station was sealed off for much of last night as police searched for weapons.</p>
<p>Detective Superintendent Ashley Croft, who is leading the inquiry, said: &#8220;This was a reckless act of violence that has resulted in a teenager tragically losing his life and our thoughts are with his family at this time. We are working closely with our colleagues at the Metropolitan Police to build up a picture of what took place immediately before, during and after the attack and ask anyone who was at the station at the time or who has any information to get in touch.&#8221; He added: &#8220;We believe the attack started on steps leading into the Tube station on Terminus Place before continuing into the Circle and District line booking hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stabbing is the fourth killing of a teenager in London this year, although the number of these deaths is down compared with recent years. In 2008 30 teenagers were killed, many of them in gang fights.</p>
<p>Today Kit Malthouse, the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said: &#8220;Despite the huge reduction in teenage killings in the last two years, this horrible incident shows that we have still not won the battle against knife crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone with information should call 020 7391 5275 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.<br>

								<h2>Man&rsquo;s Arm Nearly Hacked Off in Brawl Between Restaurants</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Kiran Randhawa, London Evening Standard, March 26, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A man had his arm almost hacked off in a fight involving two rival restaurants in central London.</p>
<p>Staff from Azmar restaurant and the nearby Donya restaurant were caught up in the brawl last night which left pools of blood in Edgware Road.</p>
<p>The dispute began at 10pm after two cousins fell out when one began working for the rival establishment.</p>
<p>An employee of the recently opened Donya restaurant, who used to work at Azmar restaurant, is said to have confronted his cousin demanding his last pay cheque.</p>
<p>A row ensued and up to 15 men joined in the fight, which started in the Azmar and spilled out onto the pavement.</p>
<p>One of the men is said to have had part of his arm sliced off outside the nearby Portland Arms pub.</p>
<p>Shwan Chaker, 35, a friend of the owner of Donya restaurant, said: &#8220;The fight was between two cousins. One was working for Azmar but recently started working for Donya. His cousin was not happy and withheld money he owed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy from Donya then walked in to Azmar demanding his money and before you know it, there was fighting and blood everywhere. Friends of both of them joined in with the fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the guys almost had his arm chopped off.&#8221;</p>
<p>A witness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: &#8220;There was blood everywhere. The floors and the stairs inside the Azmar restaurant were coated in blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The area was cordoned off until this morning as police investigated. A tent was erected as forensic officers carried out tests. A police spokesman said five people have been arrested and are being questioned.<br>

		<p>&hellip;hundreds of terrified commuters.  Yeah, terrified they might be late for work or late for dinner.  Britain has been sinking for 50 years.  This kind of behavior is nothing new to the true Brits.  People anymore are numbed to this kind of thing.  Just another day at the office.  How about this Kit Malthouse&hellip;what an optimist.  Thinks that victory in the &#8220;battle against knife crime&#8221; is just around the corner.  Typical statement by a typical &#8220;official&#8221;.  Lawd hep us.</p>

<p>In no way is this justice.The ordinary Londoners now enduring an epidemic of third -world savagery played no part in the dismantling of order in the former colonies.Blaming them for the current mess in Zimbabwe is rather like attacking modern-day white citizens of Atlanta for slavery.If any of the rabble responsible for this killing are brought to book,I hope there is room in the cell for the entire New Labour cabinet that let them in.</p>

		<p>Now, as blacks and muslims are at an increasing risk of becoming victims of their own fellows in western countries, it is a good time to close our borders to the third world and to justify this action by our safety concerns for the potential immigrants. We would protect immigrants from crime by not letting them into the country first place, wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice?</p>

<p>I wonder if these are the true words being used &#8220;children&#8221; and &#8220;youths&#8221; I am sort of surprised that their being black was mentioned at all, though in truth, it didn&rsquo;t ACTUALLY say black, only AFRO Carib and Somali&hellip;</p>

		<p>Am I wrong here but this is the type of gang violence that not so long was almost totally absent from English society?</p>
<p>The famous belief that the English police never even carried guns is gone a long time ago? Any bobbie involved in a criminal investigation carries a firearm now. Perhaps any bobbie period carries a firearm now.</p>
<p>&#8220;All those arrested were described as of Afro-Caribbean or Somali origin&#8221;</p>
<p>And the victim is described as being from &#8220;North Africa&#8221;. Well, this is how they do it in the &#8220;old country&#8221;, so please don&rsquo;t criticize. That might be some violation of the English hate crimes laws. Clan against clan, tribe against tribe. Good to go there, good to go here [England].</p>

		<p>Please note that the &#8220;Afro-Caribbean or Somali&#8221; students were all wearing school uniforms.</p>
<p>I mention this because during the &rsquo;90s many liberals claimed that we could lower the crime rate in the inner cities by forcing public school students to wear uniforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always argued the opposite is true because when they all have the same clothes it makes it harder for their victims to identify them.  </p>

A dirty lie.  It&rsquo;s not a &#8216;knife crime issue&rsquo;.  The article itself spells it out: All were Afro-caribbean or Somali.   Race is the reason.  </p>
<p>The ridiculous title of the second article (people fight, not restaurants- which are buildings; further, when it comes to machete fights: non-whites have them, not whites) is more of the same attempt to misdirect the public, just as a magician uses misdirection, while those in power continue to make the white people of Britain (Britain itself) disappear.   For real.  </p>

		<p>#4 Wulfstan, you are only partly correct when you say the ordinary Londoner played no part in the dismantling of order in the former colonies.  Quite a lot of them were there in the anti-Apartheid rallies, working in the unions to impose sanctions on Rhodesia and South Africa, contributing money to the ANC terrorists.  The Church of England boasted that it gave more money than anyone else to the ANC.</p>
<p>And as deluded as those people were, I have a feeling the younger British generation is even more deluded. So, yes, what they&rsquo;re getting now is a necessary dose of reality.  </p>
<p>I say that without malice. I would love to see Britain recover some of its former greatness. My father and uncles fought for Britain. The people who survived the Battle of Britain and the London blitz with good spirits would be embarrassed at their progeny running around like headless chickens and getting counselling because a few Africans bled on Victoria station&rsquo;s floor.</p>
<p>But will this incident, and hundreds of others, open their eyes? I don&rsquo;t know; how&rsquo;s it working for you in America?</p>

		<p>The timing of this latest black riot couldn&rsquo;t be better. Rod Liddle, outspoken blogger in The Spectator (UK), has just been censured by the Press Complaints Commission for saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The overwhelming majority of street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the African-Caribbean community. Of course, in return, we have rap music, goat curry and a far more vibrant and diverse understanding of cultures which were once alien to us. For which, many thanks.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The transformation of England from perhaps the safest country in the world to arguably the most lawless and dangerous has taken less than thirty years. During this period private possession of firearms has been virtually outlawed, self defense has been viciously criminalized, and now the authorities are considering outlawing the possession of any knife with a point!</p>
<p>Any American who travels to the UK for any reason other than absolute necessity is either mad or completely ignorant of the danger there.</p>

<p><b>&hellip;.Brawl Between Restaurants <br>
  <br>
&hellip;.Fight involving two rival restaurants in central London.</b><br>
___________________________________________________</p>
<p>Incredible!  Two British restaurants were caught fighting. Simply amazing. What next?<br>
Naughty, naughty  restaurants! &hellip;  Bad! Bad! &hellip;  Shame!</p>
<p>If something isn&rsquo;t done to control these quarelsome restaurants,  eventually innocent  people could start getting  hurt. </p>
<p>Thanks to #5 for bringing this to my attention.  He&rsquo;s right!  It&rsquo;s incredible the lengths to which the media will go to absolve people  (at least certain people)  of any responsibility for their actions.  It&rsquo;s buildings that  have fights; knives that commit crimes;  guns that attack people. People are just innocent bystanders to these horrors that plague us.</p>
<p>This is exactly analogous to the schools. When pupils are failing, it&rsquo;s not their fault.  If it&rsquo;s not  the fault of lazy, indifferent,  racist teachers&hellip; then it must be the fault of the buildings.   What else?   You have to take the children out of that bad building in order to save them.   Just place them in another building in a nicer (i.e. whiter) area, and the problems will magically be solved.  Crime is like mold: it infects buildings and makes them unsafe. But somehow it doesn&rsquo;t grow in white areas. Science has yet to figure out this mystery.</p>
<p>Likewise with housing. You&rsquo;ve got to get people out of that &#8220;bad housing&#8221; that  produces crime (people don&rsquo;t).   It&rsquo;s not people who  turn housing projects into hotbeds of crime;  projects are hotbeds of crime that turn people into criminals.</p>
<p>It must be in the air, the water, the wiring, asbestos, SOMETHING!   Educators and social scientists haven&rsquo;t yet figured out the great  mystery that&rsquo;s causing all the crime    &mdash;   but they&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>This is all based on the Liberal assumption that,  &#8220;Children aren&rsquo;t BORN bad! People aren&rsquo;t BORN criminals.  So what made them go wrong?&#8221;  Therefore, it HAS to be the fault of some outside influence that corrupted them.  Liberal dogma precludes the possibility of any other answer.  Even to think otherwise is forbidden.</p>

		<p>What I often puzzle about is you hear so many Brits say the UK is going to the dogs, finshed, and they want to go so far as to get out and move to somewhere like Australia. Yet so few seem to make the connection to multiculturalism, immigration, diversity and liberalism. They basically cry &#8216;evil racist BNP!&rsquo; over their shoulder while packing up and leaving their own shores because they can&rsquo;t handle the deterioration and pretty much collapse of their society. 1000 pound gorilla in the room, much? </p>

		<p>Mike,</p>
<p>what you observe is the outcome of those Brits being exposed to the liberal, multicultural anti-white agenda over the past few decades. They were imposed a self-guilt and self-hatred resulting from colonialism and they have been constantly told that diversity is strength. In addition, since most humans prefer to solve their problems in the least uncomfortable way, recognizing the truth, turning around against the mainstream (e.g. voting BNP) and actively fighting for their country would be very uncomfortable and thus not the preferred option for those white Brits. Immigrating to Australia is much easier, but they fail to see that this will put the problems aside only in the short run. In a few decades, they will experience a recurrence of what happened to their monther country in Australie and they might still fail to make the connection to the points you outlined - until there will be no place for whites to escape to.</p>

		<p>Incredible! Two British restaurants were caught fighting. Simply amazing. What next?<br>
Naughty, naughty restaurants! &hellip; Bad! Bad! &hellip; Shame!</p>

<p>Lol&hellip;.reminds me of that one Stallone flick where he is a cop thawed out decades after liberalism takes over.</p>
<p>Taco Bell won the &#8220;restaurant wars&#8221; (fought with real bullets) so now all restaurants are Taco Bell.</p>

		<p>Ah, the joys of diversity.  Of course the liberals over there will say that those kids are the victims of white racism and were just acting out from a sense of frustration.</p>

		<p> I have never understood this British expression: &#8220;knife crime&#8221;<br>
 Do the knifes commit the crimes or the people handling them? It appears an attempt to blame violent crime on an inanimate object. <br>
