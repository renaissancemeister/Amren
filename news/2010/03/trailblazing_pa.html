<h1>Trailblazing Paratrooper Broke Color Barrier in Secret</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Shaughnessy, CNN, March 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When Walter Morris first joined the Army just before World War II, he wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;Negro&#8221; or &#8220;African-American&#8221; soldier  &mdash;  he was &#8220;colored.&#8221; And he was treated like all the other &#8220;colored&#8221; men who wanted to fight for their country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were servants, we were not soldiers,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;Most of us had an inferiority complex and it was a result of what they had assigned us to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Deep South in the 1940s, racism was out in the open, including in the Army.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could walk down the street in the main post exchange area and in the summer the door would be open and you could look in and see white soldiers and prisoners of war from Germany sitting at the same table drinking, smoking,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;That in itself gave you this inferiority complex. You are in uniform and you couldn&rsquo;t go in, but the prisoners could go in and have coffee and cigarettes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But by the time he left the Army, Morris would become the first &#8220;colored&#8221; man ever to earn the U.S. Army Airborne Parachutist Badge. It&rsquo;s all because he wanted to overcome that &#8220;inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morris was the sergeant for a unit of black soldiers at Fort Benning, Georgia. That&rsquo;s where the Army was training white soldiers to be Airborne parachutists.</p>
<p>So after watching the white soldiers training, he would gather up black soldiers who had finished their jobs as cooks, guards or drivers, and they would duplicate the training the white trainees had just gone through.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Morris was trying to build his men&rsquo;s self-esteem, the War Department was quietly considering creating an all-black paratrooper unit. Morris soon found himself with a new job as the top noncommissioned officer for the new unit dedicated to training America&rsquo;s first &#8220;colored&#8221; parachutists, the 555th Parachute Infantry Company, or the Triple Nickle. They decided to spell it differently from &#8220;nickel&#8221; to make sure people knew they were unique. The unit had plenty of doubters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Twenty soldiers started the training and on February 18, 1944, 17 soldiers graduated and earned the Parachutist Badge. As the unit&rsquo;s first sergeant, Morris was the first man of the 555th to be pinned with the coveted &#8220;wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>D-Day was approaching and the Triple Nickle wanted badly to jump into Europe to fight the Nazis. But the white officers who supported the Triple Nickle couldn&rsquo;t convince the generals in charge in the European theater to put the unit to use.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But soon the Japanese military created a need for the Triple Nickle&rsquo;s special skills  &mdash;  and this is why Walter Morris is not as well known as Thurgood Marshall or Hattie McDaniel.</p>
<p>The only military attack to hit the U.S. mainland during World War II involved incendiary balloons. The Japanese released bomb-laden balloons into the winds that carried across the North Pacific towards the U.S. West Coast. The intent was to set fires in cities such as Seattle, Washington, or San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>More often than not the balloons simply started huge forest fires. But the Japanese didn&rsquo;t know what the balloons were accomplishing. The War Department wanted the fires put out and wanted to make sure the news didn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service needed help putting the fires out. Morris and the members of the Triple Nickle packed up and flew west. Even they didn&rsquo;t know where they were going.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With some quick training, the Triple Nickle became the &#8220;Smoke Jumpers&#8221;  &mdash;  firefighters who parachuted into rugged mountain terrain with nothing but shovels, axes and basic supplies. Their mission meant they had to get the fire under control or out before they could return to base.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But because Operation Firefly started out as a secret, the Triple Nickle&rsquo;s contribution to protecting the home front and to history was all but lost.</p>
<p>Now the Pentagon wants to change that, honoring the Triple Nickle. Of those first 17 graduates, three are still alive  &mdash;  Walter Morris, Roger Walden and Clarence Beavers.</p>
<p>They will be the guests of honor at a ceremony Thursday at the Pentagon.</p>

		<p>They keep trying to fuel Black anger at the &#8220;evil White male&#8221; with these ubiquitous articles about Black people who had to struggle against the oppressive White man.  There&rsquo;s also another purpose to it and that&rsquo;s to keep Whites guilty and when you feel guilty about something you can&rsquo;t fight any injustice against YOU because you feel that you deserve punishment.  This is the way they want Whites to feel.  All this is propaganda in the continuing ever-present attempt to destroy the White race.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how something that happened maybe once, for who knows what reason, and in almost every case not even witnessed first hand by the person telling the story, how that becomes an overall reality believed by everyone. And soon it&rsquo;s &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; and &#8216;hate&rsquo; to not fully go along with every detail of the story. One that was probably inaccurate, if not opposite from reality, in the first place. At least that&rsquo;s how it works if you&rsquo;re in one of the victim categories.  </p>

<p>And, it certainly is not entirely the same, I have read a similar account written by a white WWII soldier who said that he &#8220;was ashamed to tell my family where I spent the war   &mdash;  cleaning the barracks and scrubbing  the toilets of German officers held as prisons of war at Ft. Riley, Kansas.&#8221;  This soldier also expressed his bitterness that the Nazi officers still were accorded all the privileges of officers, including having accesss to the U.S. Officer&rsquo;s Club, where they were served drinks each evening without charge.  Perhaps we carried the terms of the &#8220;Geneva Convention&#8221; a bit too far in this case?</p>

		<p>Being an old Airborne soldier myself, I don&rsquo;t quite know what to make of this story, especially given that so much &#8220;black history&#8221; these days is pure invention.</p>
<p>First off, it&rsquo;s rather unusual to designate a company numerically.  Companies are normally designated by letter, battalions by numbers (2d Battalion 24th Infantry Regiment), and regiments and divisions by numbers also, such as 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division for example.  There was in fact a black Triple Nickel in Korea, the infamous 555th anti-aircraft, best known for their propensity to break and run at the first sight of a ragged Chinese grunt, as was the equally infamous all-black 24th Infantry Regiment.  The disgraceful performance of the 24th Infantry, in fact, was the catalyst for the integration of the Army in Korea, when congressional hearings predictably blamed their performance on segregation.  In the event, the 24th was reformed and its members assigned to various white units throughout Korea. The rest of the US Army was de-segregated at this time also.  By the way, the putative 555th Company of twenty men was less than half a platoon.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t speak for today&rsquo;s Army, there&rsquo;s no question that in Vietnam a hugely disproportionate number of all disciplinary problems (AWOL, disobedience, cowardice, etc) involved black troops, even though they comprised only about 12% of line company strength at that time.  Interestingly, in today&rsquo;s Army, in which recruits can pre-select their preferred MOS, line companies are now overwhelmingly white and Hispanic, blacks being found almost entirely in support functions.  We&rsquo;ve come full circle since WW II, when blacks were limited by policy to support roles, such as supply, transportation, and various other non-combat roles.</p>
<p>I have to chuckle when I see pictures of black grunts in Iraq or Afghanistan; I wonder how long the cameraman had to hunt around to find one.</p>

		<p>While the subject is up&hellip;  why has everyone on Earth heard the story of the shameful internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. .  but no ever hears about Italian and German Americans who were also interned during WWII? Is examining the &#8216;unpleasant&rsquo; history important, or not?</p>

<p>After 1,200 jumps, the fire season and the war were over.&#8221;</p>
<p>They &#8216;had to get the fire under control&rsquo; or else? Since it&rsquo;s not reported that anyone died trying, I&rsquo;ll assume they successfully put out or got every fire under control.</p>
<p>If that was the case, shouldn&rsquo;t their 100% success at fighting fires be tauted as a great accomplishment as well?</p>

		<p>Yes, those were horrible days, back then in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s.<br>
You had prayer in every classroom, God in the country and the country in churches. It was an embarrassment to be a girl in HS and known to &#8220;put out&#8221; let alone be pregnant.<br>
One parent stayed home and raised the children, one parent worked and was proud of his job be it auto mechanic, teacher, ditch digger or janitor.  Crime especially murder was very low in occurrence, and the death penalty was expected for murderers.  And blacks were segregated.  <br>
NOW we have blacks integrated, God has been given the bum&rsquo;s rush, prayer is out of the schools and homosexuality is taught blatantly, churches are dying as is the spiritual well being of the country,  middle schoolers are engaged in orgies and nude texting, half the young people dress, act, and talk like ghetto blacks, crime is rampant, nobody is proud of their job, women have to work as well as men to pay taxes for black entitlements, crime and murder and drugs are rampant and I put it ALL ON INTEGRATION.  INTEGRATION is what brought it all to us.  Because all of it comes from black &#8220;culture&#8221; and behavior. And, I might add, MANY savvy Southerners of the 50&rsquo;s PREDICTED that this is exactly what the country would look like after integration.   Maybe segregation wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all?</p>

		<p>In response to #5-</p>
<p>You know why.  Because pointing out that white Americans were spied on and interned as well as the Japanese kinda hurts the whole &#8220;white racist government&#8221; argument.  My German grandmother lived in an ethnically German neighborhood during the war.  </p>
<p>Their neighbors were first-generation immigrants from Germany, and there was often a couple FBI men parked somewhere on the block in a nondescript black sedan watching their house.  No chance I&rsquo;d know this if my grandmother hadn&rsquo;t told me.  Still haven&rsquo;t found anything more than allusions to this in any history book.</p>
<p>On a side note, I can&rsquo;t believe someone hasn&rsquo;t come out with this yet, so here it is: did they call themselves Triple Nickle because &#8220;they wanted to be different&#8221; or because they didn&rsquo;t know how &#8220;nickel&#8221; is spelled until after the patches were ordered?</p>

		<p>3 Anon, I don&rsquo;t believe that story about an American soldier cleaning the barracks of German officer POWs.  That work would certainly have gone to German enlisted POWs.  And free drinks every evening at the Officers&rsquo; Club for POWs?  Gossip.    <br>
     Germans had almost no chance of successfully escaping once they landed in the U.S. and the Army didn&rsquo;t want to waste manpower guarding them, so they were treated pretty leniently, but those stories are just some ex-soldier&rsquo;s storytelling.    </p>

<p>Apparently he&rsquo;s not a historian.  Towns on the Pacific Coast were attacked on at least 4 separate occasions by Japanese submarines and floatplanes launched from them.  </p>
<p>German submarines routinely operated within sight of the Eastern Seaboard and ships were sunk within sight of New York City and Boston.  A tanker was torpedoed in the mouth of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>But then again this would ruin a story about a bunch of &#8220;paratroopers&#8221; who apparently were so good the Army dropped them on top of a forest fire and said &#8220;your only way out is through that fire, so you&rsquo;d better put it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fraternizing with prisoners of war?  Treating them better than GI&rsquo;s? Call me a sceptic, but I find this unsubstandiated story hard to believe. Just more griping. Nothing but hearsay that we&rsquo;re supposed to believe because somebody says so.  Ditto with  post #3, equally unsubstantiated. As time goes by, these stories are easier and easier to fabricate or at least embellish, with no one to contest them.</p>
<p>And why is this revelation suddenly coming out just now, more than half a century later, during the Reign of Obama?  Coincidence?</p>

		<p>The article makes it sound like Japanese incendiary bombs were starting fires all over the Pacific northwest and the 555th was fighting them for some time. Here&rsquo;s a blurb from an army history site:</p>
<p>&#8220;The battalion did not serve overseas during World War II. However, in May 1945 it was sent to the west coast of the United States to combat forest fires ignited by Japanese balloons carrying incendiary bombs. Although this potentially serious threat did not materialize, the 555th fought numerous other forest fires.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sent to the west coast in MAY 1945, a few months before the end of the war and helped put out normal forest fires. No Japanese balloon bombs were ever credited with starting fires.</p>
<p>This article reminds me of the ficticious exploits of the Tuskeegee Airman, who &#8220;never lost a bomber they flew cover for&#8221;&hellip;..a blatant Hollywood lie that everyone took as fact. </p>

<p>Well, that would make sense of this story, though it would be a battalion less than the size of two infantry squads.  In fairness, one can&rsquo;t expect any MSM reporter to get anything he does on the military factual and straight.</p>

		<p>Thank you Cliff Yablonski.   Japan released some 9,000 balloons, hoping them to reach North America.  About 300 did,  but &#8220;little damage was caused.&#8221;  It was  a desperate gesture on their part, but a failure. </p>
<p>There were several sub attacks on the W.Coast, all pathetically ineffectual.  One, a shelling of an oil field near Santa Barbara, caused about $500-1000. damage. Another, at the mouth of the Columbia River,  only caused damage to a baseball field and some phone cables.  A Canadian lighthouse in BC, was shelled but not hit.  None of these attempts involved casualties or serious damage.</p>
<p>There is mention in the Wiki article of the 555th, including the fact that there was one casualty from fighting  &#8220;a fire&#8221;, but there is no indication that it was related to the Japanese balloons. It was on Aug. 6th, 1945, at war&rsquo;s end - so probably not.<br>

		<p>Gosh, he makes it look like putting out forest fires was more dangerous than jumping into Normandy on D-Day! Again, they are trying to create the impression that only blacks fought in WW II.<br>
   The 555 was organized after the surrender of Germany. If Japan had not surrendered, they would have been sent against Japan. </p>

		<p>As an Iraq veteran, I can say the U.S. military there looked   &mdash;   and I think still is   &mdash;   greatly disproportionately white, compared to non-deployed troops. American faces there seem as white as our whole country was 30 or 40 years ago. Also, as others point out, combat units are whiter than other units, and truly elite units, like Special Forces, are lily white, to this day. </p>
<p>To give credit where it&rsquo;s due, I met some fine hispanic soldiers and marines in Iraq. No doubt some good black servicemembers are deployed. I knew of one.</p>
<p>Contrary to this article, blacks actually have a reputation for avoiding the airborne out of fear of heights. BTW, I understand there once was a requirement for all Marine officers to pass a swimming test   &mdash;   not unreasonable for an amphibious force. The requirement was dropped because a certain group too often can&rsquo;t swim at all.</p>
<p>I feel a bit uncharitable recounting all this. I&rsquo;m no great warrior myself. But Shaughnessy&rsquo;s implied white bashing is over the top, even if it is normal now.</p>

		<p>There may soon come a day when the history told to children is as unrecognizable to us as the bastardized history-for-retards told in the &#8220;Time Machine&#8221; at the end of &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221;.  They&rsquo;ll say that Martin Luther King personally led a battalion of black warriors as they parachuted into Berlin and captured Adolph Hitler.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t shoot a rifle as well, they don&rsquo;t swim as well, they don&rsquo;t follow a course on the ground from a map as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Mundy speaking on Sixty Minutes about the paucity of general officers in the Marines. I must say the General did look and sound stupid.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting the Marines NO LONGER have a swim requirement as part of the basic qualifications to become an officer?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Most of us had an inferiority complex and it was a result of what they had assigned us to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thre are a number of black oriented web sites that describe the Army of the period calling black troops as &#8220;cowards&#8221;. That is not the exact word that was used. The exact word was TIMID. Meaning non-assertive and non-aggressive. TIMID and coward are not having one and the same meaning. Seems the observations of the white officers was pretty much right on the money, according to Morris. And don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I admire and respect persons such as Morris and his cohorts. They were brave men and deserve our respect.</p>
