<h1>Wave of Refugees Resettling in Indianapolis</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Thomas, Indianapolis Star, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hussein [a woman] is among a recent wave of refugees who have resettled in Indianapolis. More than 1,110 refugees are expected to make Indianapolis their home this year, an increase of more than 30 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Some come as families. Some come alone. All are desperately seeking a new life while escaping economic or political strife unimaginable to most Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The vast majority of refugees who settle in Indianapolis are Burmese, who continue to be the largest refugee group in the U.S., followed by Iraqis.</p>
<p>Refugees such as Hussein, who come from nations that are represented here in fewer numbers, can face an especially difficult adjustment.</p>
<p>Refugees &#8220;follow the American narrative of people seeking out a better economic or political life,&#8221; said Una Osili, associate professor of economics and philanthropic studies at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. Advertisement</p>
<p>&#8220;They bring with them diverse cultures, diverse traditions that help to enrich the fabric of our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also come with their own set of difficulties.</p>
<p>Indianapolis Public Schools, for example, has been struggling to accommodate 21 new refugee students since February. Six more are due to arrive by the end of this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials with Catholic Charities Indianapolis and Exodus Refugee Immigration, the two refugee resettlement agencies in Indianapolis, cite the area&rsquo;s relatively healthy economy, a welcoming community and an established Burmese population of about 8,000 people on the Southside for why refugees are placed here. About 75 percent of Indianapolis&rsquo; refugees each year are Burmese. (Burma is also known as Myanmar.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the key is community stakeholders and churches assisting the agencies and having a dedication of what they&rsquo;re doing,&#8221; said Susan S. Boyle, Indiana&rsquo;s refugee resettlement coordinator. &#8220;Everybody works together to accomplish this.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the most pressing obstacles to overcome is a new language. Parents and their children oftentimes are learning English simultaneously. For adults such as Hussein, the classroom is often the leasing office at Stratford Apartments, which many refugees call home. For the students, it&rsquo;s in classrooms across Indianapolis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spanish is by far the most prevalent language among those who are limited- English speakers  &mdash;  which make up more than 11 percent of the district&rsquo;s enrollment  &mdash;  but IPS students speak more than 40 languages in all.</p>
<p>Last week alone, 11 refugees enrolled in IPS schools from countries including Congo, Ethiopia and Sudan.</p>
<p>Six other students  &mdash;  five Burmese and one Ethiopian  &mdash;  will call Indianapolis home by the end of this month.</p>

		<p>Here we go again! Just yesterday I had to take time out of my busy day to comment on the Indochinese in our beautiful city of Ft. Wayne. Now, here I am again having to rant about the brownskins now being forced onto the beautiful city of Indianapolis. Again, I will pose the sophisticated question as to why these uneducated jungle people are not living on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard with the high class creeps like Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s kin. Is it too much to ask for the limousine liberals of the east coast who bring them to Ellis Island to just go ahead and find a cozy shack for them behind their mansions? Why is it that the swimmers of the east coast can never do anything right when it comes to bringing the indigent to Amerika? I have been to Indy many times in my life and now I will have to carry punji sticks just to feel safe while cruising the malls. I had enough of booby trap devices after two tours of the god-forsaken jungles of Vietman; now I have to worry about being slapped in the gut with a punji in Indy. </p>

		<p>Living in Texas myself - these numbers reported here have me thinking of making a move to Indy! Some days I certainly feel a bond with General Custer. </p>
<p>Suffice to say our &#8216;government&rsquo; will not rest until every decent sized metropolitan area is saturated with &#8220;diverse cultures, diverse traditions that help to enrich the fabric of our communities&#8221;. </p>
<p>Is there an end to this madness?</p>

		<p>Wow, just another reason to rush into the old city limits (pre-1967) of Indianapolis, buy that house (at a fantastic discount) and enroll your kids in IPS. We must experience these cultures. Maybe this is the best way for Eugene White (IPS Superintendent) to keep his numbers from falling. The mayor, Greg Ballard, is doing yeoman work to keep Indy afloat, however, considering the racial makeup, the city may be too far gone to recover. Adding all these people in certainly doesn&rsquo;t help. </p>
<p>When you drive through Indianapolis, West Washington Street looks like Mexico once you head west of the RR overpass. The one nice thing about Central Indiana is that there aren&rsquo;t many geological barriers to building. Hence you see people bailing out of Marion County to the sticks. </p>
<p>The IMPD (the tax grab from the townships that forced the Indianapolis Police Department and Marion County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department to merge), has enough trouble with bad apples in its ranks. Google the name Myron Powell and also search for Indianapolis police corruption. I could see a situation where in 15 - 20 years, there will be enough immigrants in the ranks that any reports of arranged marriages, female genital mutilation, and some of these other fine aspects of third world nations will routinely be covered up or the police will intimidate witnesses. </p>
<p>For Justifer, Castleton Square on the NE side is still reasonably safe. The Trader Joe&rsquo;s across the street gets a multitude of customers from Fort Wayne and you rarely see a minority in there. I wouldn&rsquo;t go to Circle Center at night, but in the daytime you should be ok. Avoid Lafayette Square Mall near 38th and Lafayette like the plague. The east side of Indy looks a lot like Gary. Carmel Clay Terrace and Metropolis are outside of Indianapolis/Marion County and I haven&rsquo;t heard any complaints about them. If this immigration nonsense continues, how long before Glenbrook Square and Jefferson Pointe wind up on www.deadmalls.com? </p>

The fabric of my neighborhood is enriched with illegal aliens who keep throwing trash in the streets and in people&rsquo;s yards and make a lot of noise.  May Osili&rsquo;s neighborhood be so enriched.<br>

Catholic Charities strikes again with their white, blind, feminist altruistic agenda. </p>
<p>If Christian fellowship organization are bent on &#8220;reaching out&#8221;, they need to limit their good-will to the host country and do what they can &hellip; JUST KEEP IT OVER THERE!</p>
<p>But no way. Instead the mindset is bring em&rsquo; here; bring em&rsquo; here; bring em&rsquo; here.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our state department and it&rsquo;s immigration/resettlement policy is to blame because they work hand in hand with these Christian groups to make all this possible.</p>
<p>The advantages that groups like Christian Charities have over the individual unorganized masses, is they are organized and in the right way, with the right connections through official channels. Simply put, they have partnershiped with the government which is a requirement if your gonna influence policy, get financially support, or attract media attention. </p>
<p>The definition of power: &#8220;The ability to influence policy and control peoples live for better or worse, with or without their consent.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Catholic Charities unfortunately has power. Just ask the average white Inianapolis citizen how they feel about their city being targeted for resettlement by Burmese invaders and what they could do to stop it legally? </p>
<p>The answer or course is nothing.</p>

		<p>Has anyone realized that we are seeing a first in the history of our country? Our elected officials have seen fit to allow another language to have equal billing with English. Supposedly, legal immigrants must promise to learn and speak English. I believe that&rsquo;s one of the rules for becoming a citizen. However, those who speak Spanish can&rsquo;t be bothered to honor that tenet. They as well as illegals have this outrageous sense of entitlement that makes them think the are above the rules of this country. I have a fantasy that I could be President for a day. If so, Americans would wake up the next morning to a nation emptied of all illegal aliens and their supporters such as Luis Gutierrez. Call your reps. This Sunday is the day the chosen ones will march on OUR streets, waving THEIR flags, and demanding THEIR (imagined) rights. Let&rsquo;s stop this travesty, and hope that one day we will get a leader who thinks more of his/her citizens than foreign criminals.</p>

		<p>I just despair when I read these news items. Why Why Why?<br>
They are Muslim, why can&rsquo;t they have sanctuary in safe Muslim countries such as Malaysia or Indonesia or even Oil Rich Arab Countries.<br>
Why can&rsquo;t they become guest workers in Saudi Arabia? (Reason is they are unemployable ANYWHERE)</p>
<p>And as for that cultural diversity as Matt #3 says.Lets have a look at some more of their culture: AIDS, Polygamy, Crime, Rape, War,Violence, Robbery, Tribal Warfare, lies, deceit, more crime, disease, large uncared for families.</p>
<p>The only way to stop the almost certain destruction of America is to stop this mass third world immigration RIGHT NOW.<br>
1st step should be to stop all welfare for 3rd world migrants.Surely the funds are needed for the existing and aging American population who served in wars and built the USA you still (just) have.</p>
<p>Just Who are these misguided fools behind it all of this. Are they blind or just totally brainless. Perhaps they have never heard of the Trojan horse? Really that&rsquo;s what 3rd world immigration is. Just as the lofty towers of Troy were brought down so were the towers of NYC brought down because unknowingly we too let &#8220;them&#8221; in.</p>

		<p>There is a proven reason for this bold move to place such people in the most unlikely places, the most white, tranquil and connected places to America&rsquo;s past are being systematically eradicated.  Don&rsquo;t believe that statement?  Google statements like East Africans in Maine or Vietnamese in Iowa.  These are not accidental occurrences.  The white population of the US has a target drawn squarely on its back.  The USA many of us grew up in, fought for in war, and hoped to raise children in is dying.  From my travels and what others have discussed with me, the current generation of white children will be the last in a long line that reaches back to the 1500s.  All of the toil, the sacrifice, the wonderment of the best place ever to have been built on earth will be gone shortly.  It is to our everlasting shame that we did not rise up and once more, die for the Divine Right to own this place.</p>

		<p>In the town of Grand Island Nebraska, 49% of the school children are nonwhite. This town has a population of about 48,000. The crime has gotten so bad more police officers are needed. More school additions have to be built, health services are strained, and everyone&rsquo;s property taxes went up to pay for all this. Hundreds of refugees from Somalia and the Sudan have been resettled in this town. At one time this was a nice little town. Now it is a little Chicago, with all the crime, And all in the name of diversity.</p>

&#8220;One more reason that I&rsquo;m an ex-Christian&#8221; Well, I can second that. Our country is in the worst economic downturn in more than 70 years and yet these groups insist on dumping the world&rsquo;s misery into our communities and expect us (the taxpayers) to pick up the tab. And with the exception of Iraq, NO AMERICAN, NOT A SINGLE ONE, is in any way, shape or form reponsible for the plight of these &#8216;refugees&rsquo;. And in case you are wondering about that second organization, Exodus Refugee Immigration, it too is a Kumbaya religious group like Catholic Charities.  They&rsquo;re assciated with Church World Refugee Service and Episcopal Migration Ministries, check out their website- <a href="https://www.exodusrefugee.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.exodusrefugee.org/</a></p>

		<p>To #14, I work in an all immigrant Spanish speaking public school.  Some of the kids point blank say that they don&rsquo;t need to learn English and that we (the white teachers) need to learn Spanish.  </p>
<p>When I hear educators lamenting the lack of English language skills among immigrants I just chuckle.  Facts on the ground in 20 years will cancel out any need to learn English as the U.S. will become officially bi-lingual.  It&rsquo;s already almost there since translation into other languages, especially Spanish, is now par for the course everywhere.  Most of my students (90%+) by the way, are functionally illiterate in Spanish.  Go figure.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the main purpose of the refugee re-settlement industry is NOT about re-settling uneducated, dirt-poor immigrants and offering them a &#8216;chance at the American dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s main goal is to destroy, demoralize and terrorize us (the White population), by settling these disease-ridden, crime-prone parasites into our clean, safe communities and then force us to support them and the many others they bring in. </p>
<p>The government pays the refugee industry a lot of money for each refugee it &#8216;resettles&rsquo; into White homelands  &mdash;   clean, safe White cities in particular.</p>
<p>According to RefugeeResettlement.com (https://tinyurl.com/yzofyfx):</p>
<p>These &#8216;charities&rsquo; are government contractors that receive money from the federal government for each refugee they bring over. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;They have almost no real responsibilities for these refugees. After 4 months the &#8216;sponsoring&rsquo; organization is not even required to know where the refugee lives.</p>
<p>The money the U.S. spends bringing one refugee to the U.S. could have helped 500 individuals overseas in countries where they currently reside&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>How would you like to live next to refugees from somalia?  What do you think would happen to the value of your home?  Would you like this next door, in your neighborhood or in your children&rsquo;s local school?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;I bought a nice house only to find out the house next to me was rented by Somalis. They take no pride in where they live at all. The place is always a mess. They are loud and very disrespectful. Their teen kids are even worse. We have had to call the cops on them 3 times. They have done everything from ruin items on my property to stealing. One is headed to jail for a gang-related stabbing. They always have new cars in front of their house&hellip;.and after about 6 months they are all banged up and then they just go get new ones&hellip;.Many times their bills end up in my mailbox and I have to take them over, several times they have had court summons for drinking and drugs. I have finally decided to put my house on the market and try to move&hellip; What is sad is that I had no hard feeling toward them until I actually met them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you think this is an anecdotal story as the refugee contractors would like you to believe or is it typical somali behavior?</p>
<p>The refugee program is another form of genocide used specifically against Native Born White Americans and it must be stopped.</p>

		<p>To the rest of the Choir:</p>
<p>The clear majority of Americans did not want the so-called Health Care Bill and we got it anyway.  So now what do we do when the communist-in-chief has said that the immigration amnesty is next?  Voting seems to do no good since probably even the conservative members of congress will be goaded into letting the 30 or million illegals stay.  This is the final battle, we lose this one and we have lost our country and maybe the world.  So we march and carry teaparty signs?  Maybe this is how the colonists felt when on the edge of the Revolution, that year or two just before 1775 when there was still hope of a peaceful settlement yet the dark clouds were gathering and most understood the future to be in question.</p>
