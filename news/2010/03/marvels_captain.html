<h1><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/marvels-captain-america-casting-crisis-15336">Marvel&rsquo;s &#8216;Captain America&rsquo; Casting Identity Crisis</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Sneider, The Wrap News, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While everyone seems to be chasing down flimsy leads about who&rsquo;s playing Captain America, I&rsquo;m left wondering: What the heck is Marvel thinking here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a month since &#8220;Captain America&#8221; director Joe Johnston promised casting news within &#8220;a couple of weeks,&#8221; and besides a disappointing (and ever-growing) list of actors I&rsquo;d never dream of installing as the title character, we&rsquo;re no closer to anything firm.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the choices thus far send all kinds of mixed signals as to where they&rsquo;re going with the character  &mdash;  except for the fact that they&rsquo;re definitely keeping Steve Rogers white. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>(At least Marvel seems intent on casting an actual American. You won&rsquo;t see Sam Worthington, Christian Bale, Daniel Craig, Russell Crowe, Gerard Butler, Jude Law or Michael Fassbender donning the star-spangled tights.)</p>
<p>The studio did just cast British-Australian Hugo Weaving as the villainous Red Skull, and is looking overseas for its leading lady, {snip}.</p>
<p>None of this answers the question: How is there not one non-white actor on this list? To have 10 actors reportedly in the running, with not a single one of them African American, Latino or otherwise, isn&rsquo;t exactly representative of the American population these days. Why pass on a great opportunity for Marvel to think outside the box. After all, isn&rsquo;t America a melting pot?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I should confess that I&rsquo;ve never been a big comic book guy, so I&rsquo;m finding it hard to drum up much enthusiasm for a Captain America movie  &mdash;  but that makes me exactly the type of ticket-buyer Marvel should be trying to court.</p>
<p>The die-hard Comic-Con crowd will see &#8220;Captain America&#8221; no matter who dons the shield. It&rsquo;s the people on the fence with me whom Marvel needs to catapult this character into the realm of Superman, Iron Man and Batman.</p>
<p>The widespread speculation surrounding the Captain America casting is reaching absurd, almost unprecedented levels, even for the Internet, and the longer Marvel waits to announce it, the more its choice will be scrutinized.<br>

<p>I find it irritating that such a question could occupy Sneider&rsquo;s little mind. </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t Captain America be a woman? They can have Captain America as a black unwed mother with aids that suffers from some other physical handicap.</p>

<i>&#8220;None of this answers the question: How is there not one non-white actor on this list?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Because Captain America isn&rsquo;t black.</p>
<p>As always, if blacks want a black anything, let them do the work to create the product themselves.</p>
<p>Blacks complain when white people allegedly &#8216;steal&rsquo; their culture, why should they expect whites to let them co-opt ours?</p>

     Better yet, he should look into what proportion of movie writers are White, and give his job to a writer of color.</p>

		<p>As previously mentioned, Captain America has been caucasian for over 60 years. He did have a partner in fighting crime, the Falcon, who was African American.  The Black Panther character is actually African.  This is truly a comment on how poisonous political correctness is to society; there is a government takeover in the works, terrorism runs practically unabated, joblessness is through the roof,and the USA has amassed a debt that will likely never be paid. So, what&rsquo;s the most important issue we face? Whether a comic book character that has been blonde and blue eyed for 60 years can be changed into a person of color, thus conforming to the zeitgeist of dopey political correctness.</p>

		<p>If you ever talk to young black and Latino boys and men on the subject of comic book action movies, you&rsquo;ll find that they absolutely love comic book action movies. The first of these was the original Batman movie. The movie featured no minorities what-so-ever, yet sold $40 million in merchandise before the movie even came out. At least half of those sales were to black people. While I&rsquo;ve never heard a minority complain that there are no minority comic book action heroes, I could see where white liberals would assume there might be a little white guilt to squeeze out of the situation and pull another race hustle. I think that minorities would love to see a comic action movie with the protagonist as a member of his or her own respective race. The problem historically is that the best comic action movies come from old comic book series featuring superheroes from the old America and the idealized values of truth, justice and the American way. By this measure, new modern American based story lines featuring minorities as lead characters simply don&rsquo;t allow for the greatness of one person to become a superhero.   </p>

		<p>Re Captain America and solving the embarrassing whiteness of being:</p>
<p>Eventually those who are making this film will simply do what is normally done to solve this terrible vexing and as yet inoperable disease of too-whiteness: Simply provide Captain America with a black boss. Think: any clones of James Earl Jones. I do not watch much television, but last night I happened to tune into a Fancast showing of something called &#8220;The Human Target,&#8221; and, of course, you guessed it: Bingo  &mdash;  black boss! On all such shows and films, the formula: The black boss shall be firm, calm and kind, deeply serious, but with a flash of humor, but, above all, must possess God-like wisdom. Like most whites I do not have a seizure and swallow my tongue when seeing a black boss on film, but the predictability of it is annoying, for the makers of these things are obviously piously laboring under the belief that they are teaching bigoted moronic average white Americans not to &#8220;hate,&#8221; when that is not really a big problem for me or most whites. But you have to wonder what selfish reasons lurk behind all this PC goody-goodness, possibly such as the freedom to cast whomever in the heck they damn well please for all the other roles, since it is hard for anyone to scream &#8220;racism&#8221; when the story&rsquo;s Mr. Big is black. As far as discrimination against blacks and other minorities in movies and television, I have to agree somewhat. My long-time theory is that right now somewhere in America there is at least one black man working in a carwash, a burger joint, or the like, who possesses the seemingly limitless acting talents equal to that of the late Laurence Olivier, and yet he cannot find a single acting job. Why? Because he specializes in playing villains.<br>

		<p>It is beyond foolish, just plain dumb-as-dirt stupid in fact, to take an iconic white character and make him black for the sake of diversity.</p>
<p>That said, Captain America is one the less interesting superheroes in Marvel&rsquo;s vast stable of superheroes. Almost any hero with &#8220;big superpowers&#8221; would be more interesting than Captain America.</p>
<p>Another way of characterizing it would be to ask &#8220;Who is in the first ranks of Marvel&rsquo;s superheroes?&#8221; so as to include superheroes without powers, such as Iron Man (Yes, I know there&rsquo;ve been Iron Man movies, and that another one is coming up. I&rsquo;m just using it as an example to get at the idea of &#8220;big superpowers&#8221; coming from an artifact like a suit.).</p>
<p>There are too many to mention. See: <a href="https://marvel.com/universe/Category:Heroes" rel="nofollow">https://marvel.com/universe/Category:Heroes</a></p>
<p>If the author is interested in black superheroes, there are also too many of those to mention: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_black_superheroes" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_black_superheroes</a></p>
<p>Batman and Superman are DC comics characters, not Marvel. The author is clearly out of his depth here, as even ten seconds of research would have revealed to him.</p>
<p>The article was pathetic, absolutely pathetic. Jeff Sneider should be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  I&rsquo;m a die hard comic fan and I wouldn&rsquo;t touch this movie if it had an affirmative action superhero in it.  Beyonce Knowles is trying to convince DC Comics and Hollywood to cast her in the role of Wonder Woman in an upcoming film.  Most of the fanfare about the idea has been negative and her selection would be the kiss of death.  That Catwoman movie with Halle Berry still hasn&rsquo;t covered the cost of production yet.   </p>

		<p>Because blacks have no history of significant accomplishments their empowering Marxist masters resort to replacing white heroes with black ones in movies.  </p>
<p>The most blatant example of this deception is in the remake of the original &ldquo;Walking Tall&rdquo; movie.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking Tall&rdquo; is a movie based on the real life story of a small town southern white sheriff who defeated an organized crime ring in his community.   </p>

		<p>Is the Marvel Universe closed? Is it full? Why is there no effort to actually create some original black super-hero characters? Why is it necessary to &#8220;revise&#8221; characters and make them black? I think it is laziness and greed on the part of Marvel and Hollywood. Frankly, it would be insulting to me. It&rsquo;s saying &#8220;We don&rsquo;t feel like taking the time and money to create a truly original character with which you might identify, so we&rsquo;ll just change this one. That&rsquo;s good enough for you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I find comic books emblematic of much of what is wrong with this country.  They promote a magical belief that good will triumph, no matter the odds.  Well, it should be obvious that this is not the case.  Evil often triumphs, especially when people are waiting around waiting for some hero to defeat it.</p>
<p>The insipid optimism that underlies comic books is perhaps very American, but also very stupid.  Is not the very notion of a &#8220;Super-Hero&#8221; vapidly and childishly stupid?  Real conservatism is not informed by optimism, but by pessimism and by a tragic understanding of life - by the realization that there are many more ways that things can go wrong than that they can go right.</p>
<p>Many comic book super-heros were conceived as revenge fantasies by scrawny kids in New York in the 1930s.  Who needs a pantheon of heroes thought up by pathetic losers?  And why are so many ostensibly grown men - like the fan-boy warriors at Republican websites like Ace of Spades HQ - obsessed with these tawdry, low-brow amusements?  And if they hadn&rsquo;t noticed, these comic book characters are almost always now employed for spreading the usual liberal Hollywood propaganda.</p>
<p>Who should play Captain America?  Might as well be Sean Penn.  Who cares.</p>
<p>Grow up.  And leave childish things behind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is not the very notion of a &ldquo;Super-Hero&rdquo; vapidly and childishly stupid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really. It&rsquo;s the natural progression from Roman and Greek mythology and their gods.<br>
It&rsquo;s also based on theories of supermen and human progression (Captain America himself is a good example of this - cutting edge drugs used to create bigger and stronger soldiers - which is what the American military is employing today).</p>
<p>&#8220;That said, Captain America is one the less interesting superheroes in Marvel&rsquo;s vast stable of superheroes. Almost any hero with &ldquo;big superpowers&rdquo; would be more interesting than Captain America&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. His lack of superpowers makes him more interesting and more relatable.</p>

		<p>In responce to poster #23:  Lorenzo Llamas is certainly Caucasian, and true his marriage record isn&rsquo;t the best, but I have never heard of him being anti-American.  He is involved in the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.  He doesn&rsquo;t seem like such a bad guy.  My point is that we shouldn&rsquo;t pick on whites of Spanish heritage.  Fernando Llamaa was an Argentinian born at a time when Argentina prided itself on it&rsquo;s European heritage.  And, no, I am not a Spaniard.</p>

		<p>If it were cast with a black actor they might as well go the whole hog and make the whole movie black as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it would be ruined anyhow.  Instead of having White superheros portrayed as minority characters why doesn&rsquo;t the comic book industry just make some unique black characters?  My guess is blacks don&rsquo;t read comic books anyhow so the issue is mute.  There is a Justice League of America movie coming out in the next few years and I understand they&rsquo;re dead set on casting the Green Lantern as some minor black figure that DC Comics created a few years ago to add a little tokenism to the DC universe.  Never mind that the main White character, Hal Jordan, has been the Green Lantern for 50 years or so.  </p>

		<p>Having a black Captain America isn&rsquo;t going to solve any of their problems, just like having a black president didn&rsquo;t.  Just like almost 50 years of welfare, busing, affirmative action, quotas, anti-white policies, and feel-good programs that naive whites have created for blacks.  </p>

		<p>27 Eric: Whenever I see a movie ad with a Black cast, I know it will be stupid.  Black movies have to appeal to people of lesser intelligence.  <br>
     BTW, I should admit that the movie &#8220;Idiocracy, with a multi-cultural cast, was funny.  And true.</p>

		<p>Since about a third of American movie-goers are black, the industry is bound to cater somewhat to them, with comedies like those of Tyler Perry or action flicks with a black co-hero.  Blacks often make fun of themselves in these features, and the villains or buffoons are often dark-skinned, just as they were in the black-created &#8220;race films&#8221; of the past.  <br>
Some black actors, like Will Smith, manage to be unethnic enough to play roles anyone could play, and then there are leading roles with a dark (no pun intended) side  &mdash;  like some of Snipes  &mdash;  that blacks portray well.  <br>
Whenever I think of a black superhero, however, I keep picturing The Brotha From Anotha Planet!</p>

<p>&#8220;I disagree. His lack of superpowers makes him more interesting and more relatable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agreed, which, by the way, is probably the main reason why so many Americans have always liked the character Batman.  No superpowers.  Zip.  He relies solely on high-tech gadgets, his genius-level IQ, a Jack LaLanne-style physique and his indomitable spirit.</p>
<p>I wonder how long before the neo-Marxists in Hollywood make him a black man.</p>

		<p>&#8220;At least Marvel seems intent on casting an actual American.&#8221;</p>
<p>An illegal 3rd world immigrant makes a poor captain. </p>
<p>Even though the leading role of captain will be played by a white, rest assured that a minority will play a prominent role teaming up with Captain America to slay the white villain.</p>

<p><i> Because blacks have no history of significant accomplishments their Marxist masters resort to replacing white heroes with black ones.  The most blatant example of this is in the remake of the original &ldquo;Walking Tall&rdquo; movie. <br>
  <br>
&ldquo;Walking Tall&rdquo; is based on the real story of a small town southern white sheriff who defeated an organized crime ring in his community.  In the remake, he is depicted as a black man.</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I predict that it&rsquo;s quite likely  we are going to be seeing much, much more of this, as America continues to darken and blacks (and other nonwhites) are handed ever more power to appease them.  Unless the coarse we&rsquo;re on takes a dramatic change,  this is only the tip of the looming iceberg ahead of us, a mere taste of things to come. </p>
<p>Many of our traditional heros as well as literary, cultural, and legendary figures   &mdash;     King Arthur, Robin Hood, Julius Caesar,  all the way to Madame Curie and Einstein    &mdash;   will be  revamped and portrayed as black (or discovered to have  been  really &#8220;black&#8221; all along!) &hellip; that or else they will simply be dropped  (or banned) from the cultural roster and forgotten  within a couple of generations as relics of  the hated old white slavemasters.  </p>
<p>Our literary figures and everything else in the culture (including language and the dictionary) will be revised to enhance the new black jingoism and to excise any remaining hint of the old &#8220;racist white culture&#8221;.   Those figures or facts that can&rsquo;t be revised will be eliminated.   Political correctness will rule and reality will be irrelevant.    As in every totalitarian culture (and I can&rsquo;t imagine it being otherwise), truth and fact will be subordinated to  propaganda and political convenience. </p>
