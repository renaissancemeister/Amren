	<p><b>From &#8220;Brokenhearted Brit in China&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I met my Chinese wife some four years ago online. Despite her speaking no English and my Chinese being basic at the time, we seemed to hit it off. We had issues though from the very start: cultural chasms, worlds apart. The Chinese in the mainland at least, inhabit a world of expediency where it&rsquo;s not a question of what is good or right or true; but rather, what one can get away with, it&rsquo;s the worst kind of dog-eat-dog world but devoid of any of the civilizing values such as fairness, kindness or basic courtesy.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s out for their own interest and devil take the hindmost. Pure unadulterated capitalism with a cruel twist. In China, there&rsquo;s a saying that if you put head over the parapet someone will shoot it off; it&rsquo;s a collective culture and so you&rsquo;d better keep a low-profile; do mediocre work at best and so avoid being noticed, utterly at odds with Euro-American drives to excellence and competence. You can imagine the kind of fall-out that happens when such disparate cultures collide.</p>
<p>My wife (then my girlfriend) told me she loved me and I was suckered in by her victim sob-story of how her violent dad would throw her against walls which is why she behaves like a demented control-freak most of the time: has to have her own way, be right about everything and have an opinion about everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Despite a professed conversion to Christianity she still behaves like a psychotic harridan most of the time but is now an expert on the Bible too to add to her list. It is truly sad that she can only feel safe when she is dominant in every conversation, every situation, bosses everyone around.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s massively insecure and this is just compensatory behaviour but if you think it&rsquo;s no big deal you should try living with it day-in-day-out: my confidence is almost all gone since she makes demeaning comments all the time, has to in order to feel good about herself. Don&rsquo;t get me started. Don&rsquo;t repeat my mistake: you cannot love these people better, at least, I have failed to, but I really tried, boy did I try. I read this online yesterday and it helped me wake up a little bit, see what you think (the language is a bit rich):</p>
<p>https://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/manipulator/eighteasyways.shtml</p>
<p>This is my wife to a tee, bar the sensitivity mentioned in point eight: https://www.rickross.com/reference/brainwashing/brainwashing11.html</p>
<p>I realized I&rsquo;d been had when she fell pregnant and aborted without even a discussion and in face of her professed love for me. &#8216;You&rsquo;re not suitable&rsquo;, was her retort. I now know this meant I didn&rsquo;t have enough money.</p>
<p>How do I know? Easy: when I got a high-paying job suddenly she wanted to marry me. That&rsquo;s when my own neediness kicked in (no living family, no friends here in China or elsewhere for that matter: &#8216;There is safety in having many advisers&rsquo;  &mdash;  Prov 7:14) and when I should have run a mile, I stayed. Now my life is a daily hell of put-downs, demeaning remarks, undermining me in front of her daughter (nine-year-old). Don&rsquo;t make my mistake. &#8220;Every credibility gap has a gullibility fill&#8221;  &mdash;  guess who supplies it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Lessons? Heed the red-flags early. A man can live without trust, without love, but not without respect.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p><b>Rick:</b></p>
<p>I married a girl from the Dominican Republic. The marriage came about as a result of a complicated string of events. She lived with me for 3 years prior to marriage and for me she was a soft loving person and physically attractive. Her education was basic and now that we are married she has not made any attempt to improve herself. Her written Spanish is embarrassing and she still speaks pidgeon english after more than 8 years together.</p>
<p>She has no understanding of finances and her expectation of me is to pay all expenses and keep her in an upper middle class existence. I have adopted her son who now I found out has an IQ in the mid 80&rsquo;s and at 18 his only interest is in eating and watching movies especially cartoons.</p>
<p>When we go shopping she never looks at price but simply picks up what she wants. While I am busy getting groceries, she is outside picking lottery numbers or lounging in the cosmetics section. Her son is better dressed than I am and he gets whatever he wants whenever he wants it, not as a reward but out of some genetically encoded programming.</p>
<p>He has popcorn to watch the cartoons with and has absolutely no interests or motivation. In summer vacation he watches TV until the early hours and gets up at noon. He has no motivation to get an advanced education and it looks as though i will have a son for life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>As you can imagine intellectual stimulation does not come at the dinner table but through the internet or reading. It is like having two young children at home; her and her son.</p>
<p>I married not out of love but out of pity; to break off the relationship would have catapulted her back into a 3rd world lifestyle. I ended up learning a hard lesson in life. If you apply your experience, perspective and values in life, to judge how another person from another culture views life you will invariably be wrong. I felt that she would be forever grateful if I pulled her out of the gutter and graciously allowed her to live like I do.</p>
<p>Wrong! All of this is expected and taken for granted. I feel like a doormat. In terms of priority in our family unit, it is her son, the dogs and finally me.</p>
<p>My job is to be the rice bowl. I am the ATM machine to spew out $ on demand.</p>
<p>The argument I hear from many men is that American women are spoiled and demanding and have no respect for their husbands. My experience is that once you bring a foreign woman into an American lifestyle she will metamorphose in a nanosecond but still maintain her cultural values. In the end it is better to stay with your own culture, the culture you know. They understand and think, eat and live the way you do and in the end there are fewer unpleasant surprises. In my case, I am patient but very aware that the day will come where I will be unable to jump across the cultural abyss that divides us.</p>
<p>NORMAN IN CHINA  &mdash;  A VOICE OF EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>Max (&#8220;My Chinese Wife Set a Trap!&#8221;) was either very naive or so out of touch with the realities of Chinese Culture, traditional family obligations, and sexual politics. He seemingly had no idea what he was getting into when he married a Chinese woman.</p>
<p>He deserves what he got; as do the other western expats in China who fall in love and marry a Chinese women who later prove not live up to the ideal image of the demure subservient Asian honey.</p>
<p>I could write volumes about the disastrous results of relationships, marriages, and divorces of expats I&rsquo;ve met here who married Chinese women.</p>
<p>Before I even arrived in China, I took the time to educate myself about the culture. As a result of my research, I knew I would only become involved with a Chinese woman if I knew they clearly understood marriage was never something I would consider. Once talk of meeting parents, giving money, living together, or marriage is mentioned, the relationship ends. Sometimes I have ended it; but most often it is the woman who walks away because she knows I have nothing that her culture and tradition demands I give her. That approach has served me well.</p>
<p>As each Laowai [greener] friend I have known here has got married, I knew they would be divorced within a two to three time span after a green card or citizenship in their home country was granted to their spouses.</p>
<p>Perhaps for your readers who which to learn more about relationships in China and Chinese women, I could recommend an excellent website operated and written by an Expat American Psychologist who has lived in China for many years. Gregory Mavrides, Ph.D. aka Talkdoc to many expats in China, discusses many aspects of issues raised by recent articles on your site. His website is called Middle Kingdom Life. This page is a good entry point .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. https://middlekingdomlife.com/guide/understanding-attraction-foreign-men-china.htm<br>

		<p>50% of OUR marriages end in divorce, so it&rsquo;s not much better on the other side. In fact, too many American women act exactly like the two wives listed above as examples.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for the man with the Dominican stepson: <br>
Wake up the son, and tell him, &#8220;Get your lazy   &mdash;  - out of bed and cut the grass! Now that you&rsquo;re 18, you&rsquo;re going to be out of school soon. After you&rsquo;re finished with your chores, we&rsquo;re going to go visit a recruiter for the U.S. Marines!&#8221;</p>

		<p>A bitter lesson for the hapless Brit. East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet. The point about expecting gratitude is spot on. NEVER expect gratitude! Not even from White women. It seems the Western guys are disenchanted with the extreme feminism of our own women and seeks romance in the Orient. Sad to say that the girl&rsquo;s motives are much more mercenary!! Should also be remembered that &#8216;romantic love&rsquo; is alien to many of these societies and the Asian women&rsquo;s desires revolve around filial piety and social advancement. </p>

What they call a &#8220;rescue&#8221; marriage. Actually it has value but only if both partners understand the parameters. They can work but for examples when they don`t,&hellip; &#8220;Leaving Las Vegas&#8221; comes to mind. The rescuee has to accept the help and want to change for the better. Sounds like that`s not the case here. </p>

		<p>I have a worthless nephew, a perpetual student who got a 20 year old internet bride from the Phillipines when, in pursuit of a PhD he never got, he finally had to move out of his mother&rsquo;s house at age 34.  He needed someone to cook his meals and do his laundry, like his mom did.  The failed scholar is now working at Wal Mart and sending $200 a month to his wife&rsquo;s family, making them the richest people in their village.  The wife, a better student than my nephew, is going to nursing school here.  I expect she will dump him when she graduates and find a better husband.  Not a bad career path for the young woman, and I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that her family planned it that way.  Now probably every family on their little island is prepping their smartest or cutest daughter to become an internet bride for a few years.   </p>

<p>By this, am I to assume he means date or have casual sex? I don&rsquo;t think he should be getting &#8220;involved&#8221; as anything beyond friends if he has no intention of ever possibly taking the relationship further.</p>

		<p>I hate to say it but Rick deserved what he got.  Marrying for pity instead of love?!   Do you mean to tell me that an American White man would be so stupid as to take a lifetime vow out of pity?  Yet I believe him.  This is the perfect example of the collective character weaknesses of many Whites. However I give him credit; at least he realizes his mistake now.  </p>
<p>The guy with the Chinese gal was another good example.  Don&rsquo;t think for a moment that these foreign women don&rsquo;t perceive the weaknesses of these White men.  They do.  Many of them use them as a meal ticket.  It&rsquo;s so sad the way our race is going down.  We&rsquo;ll need a miracle to recoup.</p>

		<p>I once knew a guy who married a woman he met in China.  She was about 10 years his junior and much more attractive than he.  They seemed to have a loving relationship in which she tolerated his constant job changes, shaky financial situation, and marital infidelities.  Then one day, after she got accepted into medical school, she announced out of the blue that she no longer wanted to be married to him.  The last I heard he had been rejected by his on-the-side lover and was delivering pizzas.</p>

<p>You made your beds gentlemen (sex was almost certainly your primary motive) and now you must deal with the ugly consequences.<br>
  <br>
Divorce these foreign losers, then find and marry white women and have lots of white children. You will feel so much better.</p>

		<p>I married a Russian woman in Ukraine and she brought her daughter after we were married.  Boy, the misery was unbelievable.  I was very careful not to be alone with the daughter.  Who needs a pretend rape charge?</p>
<p>Mom had a cool habit of showering with her daughter of age 15. After all this was normal behavior over there I was told.<br>
When she came to bed, she reeked of garlic, and her hair stuff smelled of wet dog.  Very attractive.</p>
<p>All her new Russian friends had huge houses and stacked up the SUVs. So she sure made it hot for me to provide what she clearly was entitled to.  I did a financial plan for one of them, and he had 7 pages of credit card debt.</p>
<p>She ignored me except for money and transport. Any deviation in their plans was serious anger. </p>
<p>15 year old Daughter went with a 35 year old black drug dealer she found at Normandale college in MN, (He is still there working and a part time student, and yes, looking for new girls) <br>
I learned you avoid spousal maintenance and child support if you are at the school, and this black guy had a lot of offspring.</p>
<p>They loaned out the car regularly to drug dealers needing a clean plated car  (in Minneapolis) in return for free drugs, (My title) I was told that people were prejudiced against the blacks and they were really nice people.</p>
<p>Dealer told her if the cops stopped them he would say they were his drugs, this while she was on an H4 visa!  Stupid slutty tart!</p>
<p>And the wife, it seems she used my bed with her boyfriends when I was not home, They were too cheap to spend for a motel, and they ran through my liquor as well. She was gone just after I got her a GC.</p>
<p>I suggest you divorce them immediately upon bringing them here, hide the papers, who knows, may be it will work out for someone one day, and that way when their driving kills or maims someone, you don&rsquo;t get wiped out by them financially.  Just pull out the enacted divorce papers and save yourself from bankruptcy.  These people don&rsquo;t care they will just move onto the next guy anyway if you go bust.</p>
<p>Wife&rsquo;s teeth were about $20,000 to get done too.  She wanted to know how much I had saved for her daughters&rsquo; university education, and when was I going to get her 24 year old son here?<br>
She knew I was lying when I told her he could not come as a minor so was on his own.</p>
<p>These are clearly the most despicable people on the planet.<br>
Tell everybody! It is real abuse. Its like living with Satan.</p>

		<p>In the book: &#8220;What Every Cop Knows&#8221; - - anecdotal accounts of life by Chicago cops, the observation was made that these middle aged white men that marry Filipino mail order brides have a rate of death during the first year of marriage that is much greater than the norm.</p>
<p>IT IS CALLED DIGITALIS! Simulates death by heart attack. Marrying one of these non-white mail order brides can be very deadly to your health!!</p>

		<p>Several years ago, I dated a half korean woman. We even lived together for a while. Her father had been army and met her mother overseas. This is EXACTLY the kind of manipulative, gold digging tactics she and her mother BOTH used. They were serial manipulators who ruined the lives of at least a half dozen men each. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I&rsquo;m a good judge of character so I wasn&rsquo;t that far in before I figured out her game and left her. Within two weeks she was living with another guy. Apparently, she had been keeping him around &#8220;just in case&#8221;. I suppose one could argue her behavior was learned from her mother. But it was what it was. </p>
<p>It was fun for a while and I left when the getting was good. So I&rsquo;m not bitter or anything. I&rsquo;m just sayng that if you think you&rsquo;re going to mess around with these gold diggers and not get burned then you&rsquo;re fooling yourself. And if you think that your little honeypot is going to be different then you&rsquo;re in for a rude awakening. If you&rsquo;re looking for love then you aren&rsquo;t going to find it there. You&rsquo;re better off sticking with your own.</p>

		<p>Race traitors whining about it all going wrong.  Cry me a river.  How about you stick to your own race as a start?  How about you find a mature person your own age rather than &#8220;going native&#8221; because you can get somebody 20 years younger than you?  WHY do you think somebody 20 years younger than you was willing to go with you at all???  YOU knew it was about getting money and position in return for being willing to hump the old white guy.  And when a better offer comes along, or you lose your job?  You&rsquo;re surprised they dump you?  Who&rsquo;s the one with the mid 80&rsquo;s IQ again?????</p>

<p> A liberal fool got what he deserved. I remember a Nigerian woman telling me about her cousin sister who roped in a German guy (What is with Germans and black women these days?). Her sister already had a child from an earlier relationship but she was in Nigeria with her German boyfriend she introduced her own child as her sister&rsquo;s child. Lying and cheating is the way of life in the non Northern Euro, non Japanese world.<br>
Anyways I have always believed that it is always better to marry someone of the same religion, race, linguistic background, ethnic background etc&hellip;, more the similarities between the two, more stable the marriage will be. The youth of today are totally clueless in the affairs of human relationships and need guidance. They could start by reading this book, The Choice of a Mate by Anthony M. Ludovici.</p>

		<p>It is no secret that Russian women will sucker some American man to send her money under the pretenses that they will someday marry. Some even come to the states under the fiancee visa that requires that a marriage take place within 60 days or she has to return to Russia. Some end up marrying a hapless American and leave when she gets her green card. Some even have boyfriends in Russia where they send letters and pictures to the bridal agencies that match Russian women with American men. When the gravy train stops, so do the letters and the emails from the woman and she moves on to her next victim.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine is now defending himself against the slanderous accusations made by his (lovely young Korean) ex-wife because she accuses him of abandoning her in South Korea and fleeing back to North America. </p>
<p>Once their married failed to work out   &mdash;   they had both been  working, but he was making twice as much as she was, so he was supporting her   &mdash;   she started making outrageous demands when it came to splitting up the marital assets. His white father had contributed over $20,000 to get them off to a good start. That money went to a deluxe apartment which anyone in the West would have envied. (In the Korean system, if you make a big enough down payment, you can reduce your rent to nil or almost nil, and the landlord will just invest your deposit and make income off of it.) </p>
<p>When they decided to divorce, she wanted half the assets in the marriage, even though HIS WHITE FAMILY had contributed the overwhelming majority of it. My friend could prove, from bank records, that most of the assets in their relationship were HIS from before the marriage. (Korean law says you can keep the assets which you already had before the marriage.) What&rsquo;s more, during the course of the marriage, <b>he split his money with her as a matter of course</b>. Therefore, the settlement should have been very small. But she and her family did not see it this way. </p>
<p>The argument got nastier, and both sides had to get separate lawyers. </p>
<p>My white friend&rsquo;s lawyer told him that, as a foreigner in Korea, he was over a barrel. <b>Korean judges never find in favor of non-Koreans, </b>my friend was told. What&rsquo;s more, he was expected to give her money because he was asking for a divorce. A settlement of some $10-15,000 would have been typical. </p>
<p>(The couple has no children and got married in late 2006.)</p>
<p>Then she started to wage a PR offensive, for lack of a better word. She was spreading rumors that he had fled to Canada without telling her. (He had in fact moved into a Korean motel and had receipts to prove it.) </p>
<p>Then he moved back home with his family for a while. When he got back to Korea to work, she had filed a lawsuit against him, demanding some $95,000 (or 90 million Korean won). More than half of this was due to so-called &#8220;pain and hardship,&#8221; which is ridiculous considering the fact they&rsquo;d been married less than four years and had no kids. </p>
<p>The process is still underway, but he makes some poignant observations: </p>
<p>1. He could never make her happy, in spite of the luxuriousness of their apartment and his work schedule. She would constantly start arguments with him. Sometimes he would react, sometimes not. What I wonder is, would she have tried that with a <i>Korean</i> husband?</p>
<p>2. He can&rsquo;t figure out when she changed. She was demure little geisha when I knew her before the marriage; she was learning English and seemed like a carefree, &#8220;modern&#8221; girl. Sometime after the marriage, she became a harpy. </p>
<p>Of course, I offer another observation:</p>
<p>BEFORE THEIR MARRIAGE, her racist Korean father revealed his true colors. This was during a major Korean holiday which is their equivalent of Thanksgiving. &hellip;My white friend decided to &#8220;offer an olive branch&#8221; of sorts to show that he was a suitable candidate for their beloved daughter. (A lot of South Korean men work as pizza delivery drivers and other jobs that pay less than half what my friend was paid.) My friend even paid for his own traditional Korean &#8220;hanbok&#8221; uniform so as to impress his future father-in-law. But the father in law cancelled it <i>literally at the last minute</i> by barring my friend from entering. His words, which my friend understood, were, &#8220;No foreigner will ever set foot in my house!&#8221; </p>
<p>They got married anyway. I think my friend figured that he and his girlfriend would stay married, and the old man would change his ways. Guess again&hellip;.Now, in spite of the divorce and the lawsuit, my friend&rsquo;s ex-wife actually went to his white family&rsquo;s doorstep   &mdash;   how could she afford the flight?   &mdash;   and, in compensation, demanded that they sponsor her for citizenship. <br>

		<p>I hear lots of American guys accuse American women of being gold diggers, yet most women (even from Eastern Europe, not just the non-white countries) are just looking to marry an American or Western European man for citizenship.  ANY WOMAN that marries me is signing a prenuptial agreement.  I&rsquo;ve already dated girls in my younger days who used me to buy them stuff (even the whites girls do that).  Not going to let that happen again!</p>

		<p>At the same time it cannot be denied that what drives many white men to marry non-whites is that many (not all, but many) white women are practically unmarriageable.  Think of the uber feminist with the perpetual &#8216;chip-on-the-shoulder.&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ve met a few and they are really something to behold.  Kick-butt in their careers but absolute neurotic control freaks in a relationship.  </p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s a new book out about that now by such a woman who tells these uber women to settle for marrying down rather than being alone forever.)</p>
<p>This phenomenon has given rise to the large number of childless old spinsters who become social justice do-gooders.  Basically, their maternal senses are warped due to their disdain for their biology and they take endlessly needy minorites as their &#8216;children by proxy&rsquo; that they mother and baby and try to nurture.  I wonder why no one has ever recognized this before.</p>

		<p>Some foreign women were made to be man traps for gullible saps.  </p>
<p>Where I work there are many Dominican females.  To a girl they are all literal &#8216;sex-pots.&rsquo;  They are seething and oozing wild, man-fantasy sex.  They are probalby the most sexual of all latino cultures.  This is an integral part of their way of life and they cannot stop themselves from pole-dancing type gyrations every chance they get.  That&rsquo;s what multiculturalists mean when they talk about &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; in other cultures.  They&rsquo;re talking about sexual flair and expression.</p>
<p>Some men marry oriental women because of the perceived exoticness and expected harmonious domestic skills.  There are many such successful marriages, but the green card danger is always there and the poorer the girl, the greater the danger.</p>
<p>I know guys who married Mexican women for the perceived family values.  Those marriages are, strangely enough, quite stable.  The more caucasian-looking latina girls from south america or puerto rico actually seek out white american men, because as two such women explained it, &#8220;Who are we gonna marry, latino lettuce pickers?&#8221;  These marriages that I know of are also stable, but probably a big factor is the whiteness and outlooks of the foreign women coming in.</p>
<p>I married a light-skinned woman from India, but who was raised here and is more westernized than you can imagine.  I am sorry to say that hotness was a very big factor, although domestic harmony is not as it could be as she has also been indoctrinated in the western femiinist worldview.  </p>
<p>I do agree that men need to really investigate their potential wives beforehand, especially for cultural compatibility.  Due to the way America and the West is changing, we&rsquo;re going to see more and more of this thing.  It makes me wonder if perhaps we should focus more on preserving western cultural values and civilization than on preserving a perceived racial purity - and this from we Americans who are polyglot of European ethnicities that, back in Europe, think of each other as whole different species!  </p>

		<p>KGB - I am familiar with a lot of these sorts of stories about Korea (the law almost always ruling against the foreigner, the racist parents of the partner, the general anti-foreigner attitude of a lot of people). I wonder why they get away with it so easily? They seem to be considered one of the US&rsquo;s model nations in Asia. Yet they have at times an aggressive nationalism that I&rsquo;m curious as to why it hasn&rsquo;t gotten more attention. They do almost whatever they want, we&rsquo;re held up to the microscope.</p>

		<p>I am married to a Chinese woman, so I&rsquo;ve some experience.  Certainly, for many white men, a Chinese wife will not work out and should be avoided at all costs.  But, for many of these men, a white wife is not the ticket, either. Understand and avoid the following and you may find a wonderful loving wife:</p>
<p>Most Chinese girls &#8220;advertising&#8221; in the dating services want to get married within 3 months.  This is due to the expense of translation, and the understanding that once the newness of corresponding wears off the man may be looking at different girls.  But ask yourself, who can know another person, Chinese or otherwise in just 3 months?</p>
<p>If you find a girl on a dating service, be aware that you are not corresponding with her, but rather a translator who &#8220;knows the rules&#8221; and is just looking to make a commission. </p>
<p>Most Chinese girls do not speak English, and few Westerners speak Chinese.  How can anyone expect a successful marriage without communication?</p>
<p>Many guys go for a girl 15-30 years younger.  Does this make sense to anyone?</p>
<p>Do not think the woman&rsquo;s kids will adapt well to the U.S. without problems, and if you have kids expect further difficulty.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go to China in order to &#8220;teach English&#8221; with the real agenda of finding girls.  In general, English teachers employed by private companies are considered losers by the locals, and intelligent/desirable women are typically not interested in a long term relationship with a loser.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known guys who&rsquo;ve ignored the above and married young pretty Chinese women.  Then they are surprised when the girl takes off after obtaining a Green Card. </p>
<p>Finally, understand that intelligent Chinese women are first and foremost women: if you treat them kindly and provide for them you will most likely be rewarded. On the other hand, if you want them to be your maid and beer fetcher, then I wish you well after your young pretty wife deserts you.</p>

		<p>White men that marry non-white women always have ulterior motives in the end, and are the most pathetic species on the planet, specifically White men that marry Asian women.</p>
<p>If you need to get your jollies off with your little Oriental doll, don&rsquo;t have kids. It&rsquo;s pseudo-pedophilia and a clear admission that you are not man enough to handle a blue eyed goddess because you&rsquo;re afraid she might hurt your little boy feelings. Get real. </p>
<p>How do I know this? My mother was Chinese. The first story describes her to a T. The whole conversion to Christianity. I literally hate my father because of it. He suffers from antisocial disorders and borderline Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. He couldn&rsquo;t land a nice white woman if he wanted. Luckily my mother must&rsquo;ve been part European or something since she probably came from a long line of race traitors, because I look white.</p>
<p>White men that turn their back on nice Irish of British American gals, who in my experience are the sweetest lasses on the planet, bar none, and have none of the severe white worship, gold digging, self-hatred that ugly brown skinned women have, are the weakest, most pathetic, most disgusting people on earth, and I can&rsquo;t even look them in the eye when I talk to them. Many white men feel the same way. It&rsquo;s just as bad as black men with white women.</p>

<p>Yes they did think of each other as different species but we now know they share more genes with each other than they do with nonwhites.  You can&rsquo;t preserve western cultural values and civilization when the majority of the population is non white.  If we could, Latin America, with its Spanish culture, would be as competitive as the US.  Your wife most likely is interested in Indian culture to some degree and will share that interest with your children.  Your children will look at dead white males in history and not really care who they were or what they did.  Obama types will be their heros.  I think our future will be very similar to Latin America.  As for my own European white children, I hope they have a place to go and escape your world  Jay.  I talk to my kids about race all the time.  I have told them marrying their own kind is honoring their family.  </p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t get married until I was 39, and I&rsquo;ve very, very happy I waited.  Marrying young is nearly always a disaster for men, whatever race the woman is.  Throw cultural differences into the pot with youthful relationship naivete and general inexperience with life, and you have an unmitigated recepie for disaster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very happy I&rsquo;m not single anymore.  Colorado Springs is a military town, and the dating scene here stinks out loud.  My main complaint was the lack of single, educated young women who were conservative without being Jesus-freaks.  The solution to my quandry was Japan.</p>
<p>I will have to disagree with Anonymous at 1:23 PM in that it isn&rsquo;t always &#8220;pseudo-pedophilia&#8221; that interests white men in east Asian woman.  I simply wasn&rsquo;t keen on an overweight gal with a bad attitude, a bunch of tattoos and a case of genital herpes from her black ex-boyfriend.  When a woman deliberately cultivated trashiness - trendy in much of the West, where Hollyweirdos are permitted to set our standards, I treated her accordingly and stayed away.</p>
<p>This said, the article and the above posts tend to confirm everything I have ever heard about Chinese women; i.e. they tend to be grasping and manipulative.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I had occasion to meet and date a Russian girl. She was white with a fair complexion and had blonde hair and blue eyes. She spoke English perfectly, albeit with an accent, was university educated, and had a decent job. I thought she was a real catch. Gradually, as our relationship progressed, I began to notice several disconcerting elements about my fair, Russian beauty: 1. She had three valid passports issued by three different countries (Russian Federation, USA, and Canada). 2. She expected me to pay for everything even though our income levels were about the same. Her insistence that I foot the bill was driven home when we discussed living together. She was all in favour of this arrangement providing that I paid for all the living expenses. 3. She received many, mysterious phone calls at all hours of the day. 4. She occasionally disappeared for a couple of days at a time. 5. She constantly, but subtley, derrided my mother. 6. I caught her shoplifting cosmetics one day, and when confronted, she expressed the view that it was her right to steal from the store. This relationship lasted for about three months. There were too many strange and potentially destructive things about this Russian girl. At the end, she didn&rsquo;t seem too beautiful anymore. I got out before there was any permanent damage to my life. It&rsquo;s best to stick with people of your own race and culture. Since then, I only date white, generational, Canadian or American women. </p>

<p>Yes, you are 100% correct here Jay - I saw terrible example of this last Sunday.</p>
<p>I attended Sunday &#8220;Christian&#8221; services at University of Chicago Rockefeller Chapel - this Gothic cathedral is fully restored, looks absolutely stunning - with 300 foot ceilings, stain glass windows - the place looked like English Kings should be coronated there.</p>
<p>There must have been room for 2,000 plus in the pews, but only around 25 people attended the service - some Asian students, some old people. The service was led by women priests in their 40s who made long sermons about Leftist politics, poor minorities, need for more gun control, Obama care. These White women weren&rsquo;t ugly, but there was simply no snow balls chance in hell any White man would ever want to marry or have anything to do with such women.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s out there then yes - all kinds mail order brides look good.</p>

<p>Just to let everyone know, comments made like the one I quoted above are false. The law is that a foreign spouse loses her green card if she divorces her American husband before two years. It&rsquo;s not legally possible for a foreign spouse to leave her American husband shortly after obtaining her green card and driver&rsquo;s license. This law is meant to prevent lonely American men from being used; it&rsquo;s also meant to prevent marriage fraud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many guys go for a girl 15-30 years younger. Does this make sense to anyone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Just a side note on this question.  Up to recently, this was a normal age differential for Europeans (and wealthier Americans)and culturally acceptable.  There was even a long period when young women were raised and educated in New England for the very purpose of eventual marriage to older, established Englishmen. Winston Churchill&rsquo;s mother was one such American woman.  Men from good families, even titled, were obligated to serve in the military.  After they had &#8220;made their fortune,&#8221; which meant establishing a personal reputation as a gentleman, and/or at least built a personal fortune, they would move up to a more managial position in society and take a young wife from a reputable family.  The reason for her youth was obviously for the founding of a family.  Family heritage, wealth, and reputation was passed from one generation to the next in this manner.  The poor usually married young as the remedy for containing Christian lust.  The males often were either enticed into service, motivated by their poverty, or they would be abducted into service, which was acceptable in times of war.  But the system created and sustained European wealth and culture, and by the way, with the church firmly behind it.  This is the system that whites posting here on Amren would be seeking to re-established, if in a more workable form - even if they donn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>But one is not likely to succeed in any task if the aim is not clear, and understanding the aim requires understanding the thing, in this case our social history, rather than our current political and social myths.</p>
<p>America began the dismantling of that very structure with Democracy, even if you call it Republicanism. But we can&rsquo;t go back, so if we are to go forward, it must be with a new hybrid of social order.  A list of current political points that would-be members must agree on will not meet the need, nor will it succeed.</p>

		<p>D.B. Cooper your comments bashing white women are out of line, I say this as a white male. If you are a white man, you are doing nothing more than attacking yourself. It&rsquo;s exactly this sort of thinking which results in miscegenation by white men and the associated problems mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>While I too am disgusted by the behaviour of some white women, it is a two way street. There was a time when miscegenation was illegal. White men who failed to oppose the legalization of such behaviour and who today fail to advocate against such perversity are partially to blame for the miscegenation of white women   &mdash;   in addition to the culpability of the women themselves. There are other examples as well.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I believe it is a man&rsquo;s duty to be head of the household. Therefore, the transgressions of women and children are essentially a failing on the part of men.</p>

<p>We have to, I am afraid, take the long view and I&rsquo;m talking centuries here.  Whites by themselves will not survive past two centuries buried in a sea of blacks and browns.  Those two groups have an uneasy love/hate relationship.  Whites will need allies and Asians are the best option.</p>
<p>Most Asians in an arc stretching from northern India through China and Korea and into Japan have a smiliar skin tone.  Some Japanese are even whiter than the average white person!</p>
<p>Group IQ among the northern Asian belt is generally on par with those of European descent.  Interracial kids between the two groups don&rsquo;t have skin color issues and the mixing is certainly not as dramatic as black/white or black/Asian.</p>
<p>Culturally, the more advanced Asians have cultures that are comprehensible to Westerners.  The Chinese dynasties resemble the Roman Empire to some extent.  Japan&rsquo;s warrior culture of the past is not far from the Crusader ideal.  Intellectual achievement has always been prized in northern India, China, Japan and Korea like it has been in Germany, France, England, Scotland and Scandanavia.</p>
<p>I know there are ultra racial purists out there, but those who see the writing on the wall tend to focus on future solutions.  We may not be able to save our gene pool in its current form (which is already transformed by the tons of mixing among white ethnic groups) but we can take steps to preserve our cultural trends, values and civilization for centuries to come.</p>
<p>Look at the way things are shaping up here in America.  Even on this board, Whites and Asians are often lumped together in juxtaposition to blacks/latinos.  Even in our neighborhoods, whites don&rsquo;t complain when northern Asians move in, but if blacks or latinos do, uh oh.</p>
<p>Think about things and take the long view.  We plan for the future of our grandkids today!</p>

		<p>From my observations on human nature, it is clear to me that these men generally made their own beds via a combination of a lack of humility and a dyed-in-the-wool liberalism.</p>
<p>I am a 28 year old man, still unmarried right now, but I regularly come in contact with young white American women. I&rsquo;d have to say that the common canard hurled about Western women is not at all true. Some may be &#8220;feminist harridans&#8221; but they are generally detected easily   &mdash;   far more so than with non-Western women!   &mdash;   and, in addition, such hardcore feminist women are viewed with disdain, and in many cases even disgust, by other women. Women, believe it or not, actually love men.</p>
<p>Young white men should also remember that young white women are far better readers of a man&rsquo;s character than the reverse. They will notice things about you that you would never think of, and discuss them with their friends, especially if they are interested in you. A young man should remain passionate and driven about his life goals, and not take abuse from other people, yet remain humble about flaws in his own character and take steps to correct them. If he tries to keep this attitude, he will find that there are enough white women around to keep his attention, and seeking out foreign women will come to seem strange or alien, even borderline creepy, to him.</p>

		<p>These tales of woe just serve to remind us that; East is East, West is West, Black is Black and White is White.</p>
<p>It should always stay that way.</p>
<p>Interacial marriages are often immigration and welfare scams or good old fasioned gold digging. As a marriage it just does not work out for every reason.</p>
<p>The same applies for forced intergration of education and housing. It just does not work.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been in few relationships in my 23 years, but have been pursued and have had flings with women of different races.</p>
<p>I had a very beautiful &#8220;fair&#8221; skinned Indian woman ask me out and we had a six month fling while I was in college. Turns out she just wanted to be with a white guy before she married an Indian man. I was that &#8220;white&#8221; guy. I&rsquo;m half-Chinese. </p>
<p>I have gone out with Asian girls that have liked me specifically because I&rsquo;m white. Can you believe that? I found their sense of humor to be lacking and them to be exceptionally cold, and their eyes, being entirely black, really disturb me. Some of them have been very brown in skin tone, too, and it was fairly obvious what they were doing. For some odd reason by mysteries in my gene pool I have brown-green eyes which are apparently even of enviable quality by the vast hordes of black-eyed women.</p>
<p>I have been hit on by black women when they found out where I went to school, and in high school I was propositioned flat out for sex by black girls. I never took them up on those offers.</p>
<p>The truest, most decent woman I have ever had the fortune of spending my time with was a white woman from Connecticut. She wasn&rsquo;t amazingly pretty, wasn&rsquo;t needy, wasn&rsquo;t high maintenance, was tolerant of my sense of humor, loved to laugh, had no ulterior motives, and never race mixed. I was white to her. Another woman that was half-Jewish and half-Irish was a terrific girlfriend and I just felt more comfortable being around one of my own, i.e., whitish, but white to most non-whites.</p>

		<p>Jay, you are wrong about white people not complaining when Asians move in.  White people don&rsquo;t complain when one or two Asian families move in, but increasingly, nice white neighborhoods are turning into Chinatowns, with Chinese stores, Chinese churches, and Chinese-majority schools.  This is NOT a comfortable situation for whites, especially for the very settled over-50s, who have to stand by and watch their nice white neighborhood turn into a foreign country in which THEY NO LONGER FIT, and in which they can no longer freely communicate, which is the basis for having any sort of neighborhood feeling to start with.</p>

<p>This is a huge problem in NYC, from what I&rsquo;ve heard. Whether or not it&rsquo;s just smoke, and &#8216;stereotyping&rsquo;, or if there&rsquo;s really a fire, I don&rsquo;t know. And it&rsquo;s not just whites, but ethnic groups of all kinds. They say Asians will take over a neighborhood and then only hire other Asians. They&rsquo;re not white, so no investigations into it from the &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; and right thinking folks, except to call for more Asian pride and Asian &#8216;diversity&rsquo; for these &#8216;victims&rsquo; too. <br>

<p>100% true.  I live in lower manhattan with my white fiancee.  The residential buildings down here are 90% asian.  They are unfriendly and uncommunicative with the white residents.  They prefer their own kind.</p>

		<p>@ Jay, post #25:</p>
<p>&#8220;[I] wonder if perhaps we should focus more on preserving western cultural values and civilization than on preserving a perceived racial purity - and this from we Americans who are polyglot of European ethnicities that, back in Europe, think of each other as whole different species!&#8221;</p>
<p>For whom? And what purpose?</p>
<p>Non-whites have demonstrated time and again that they have no appreciation for western values. They&rsquo;ll never accept them, it&rsquo;s just not their nature. If the only people who appreciate and contribute to our culture our extinct what purpose is there to keeping it alive?</p>

<p>We have to, I am afraid, take the long view and I&rsquo;m talking centuries here. Whites by themselves will not survive past two centuries buried in a sea of blacks and browns. Those two groups have an uneasy love/hate relationship. Whites will need allies and Asians are the best option.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making an alliance with a genetically different but equally capable race should not involve race mixing. We can just be allies and support each others against the rising tide of browns and blacks but keep the White and Yellow races genetically distinct from each other at the same time. And as far as Whites not being able to survive for two centuries, I am sure the Sultan of Turkey felt the same about a disunited people living on the edge of Eurasia 500 years back. The ancestors of White people had to cower in fear infront of Turks, Barbary pirates and Mongol horsemen but in some centuries Whites ruled the whole world and are still the most powerfull race. The struggle is far from over yet.</p>

		<p>It is very sad to read posts from men who, even in this cynical age, are still duped by opportunistic women.  I can feel their pain and despair, but find myself asking &#8220;Aren&rsquo;t all their problems really about sex?&#8221;  </p>
<p>I think the degree to which sex has been re-sold to the whole world(via the largely feminist and homosexually controlled Media) as a status symbol is to blame.  In gentler times certain men (and women) would have been able to live peacefully as bachelors or spinsters, without society making them feel like they&rsquo;re social outcasts by not engaging in <br>
obvious sexual activity. The incredibly ordinary looking men I see on the streets of London with Asian or Eastern European women are invariably far older and far less physically attractive than their partners,which makes you wonder how they came to be a couple in the first place. They are walking adverts for the power of the Internet Marriage Bureaux and holidays in Thailand!  Unfortunately there will be many more victims of immigrant opportunism in years to come as both Europe and America continue with their ihsane immigration policies.</p>

		<p>I know over a dozen men who married foreign women. Three married Europeans (two Brits and a German). The rest married Asians. All theirs lives turned into living hells within a year or two of bringing their foreign brides to the U.S. Any qualities of thrift or agreeability vanished within a year, two at the most. To a one, they became demanding, argumentative and lazy. If they got jobs, they considered the money they earned as &#8220;theirs&#8221; and spent it on cosmetics, clothing, eating out with their gal pals, etc. They also considered their husbands&rsquo; income as being totally at their disposal, and were disinclined to show any restraint in spending, and caused their spouses (and children) plenty of financial woes by bouncing checks and straining budgets, sometimes deliberately in response to requests to be fiscally responsible. Most of them cheated on their husbands, sometimes blatantly. All but one went for the big divorce lottery within ten years, and won big time, using the kids as bargaining chips. The one exception was a Filipina who married an exceptionally nice and passive guy, and figured she probably wouldn&rsquo;t get a better deal, since he basically gives her all the money that&rsquo;s left after he pays the bills. She spends at least three nights a week in bars, leaving him to take care of the two kids, only one of which is his. She&rsquo;s never held a job for more than a month.<br>
  Now I agree that you can, and all too frequently will, run into the same problems with American women. But like many other problems we have in America, we have them because we have let things get out of hand. Decent American women are to be found if you have the character, patience, and courage to not let them get away with bad behaviour. Granted, it can be a long and difficult search, but I firmly believe that marrying outside your nationality, and especially outside your race is not the answer.</p>

		<p>While in Ralph&rsquo;s today by Chan Marino, CA, I saw a mixed couple (white male/asian female) shopping with their child and her parents.  What was even more nauseating was that the white guy was trying to speak broken chinese to the parents, as if he was being so worldly.  Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think he was an amrenner, 2nd, are whites that far gone already?  And 3rd, every time I see a couple like this and take a look at their child, it inspires me to make sure I find a suitable white female to mate with.</p>

		<p>I got half way through reading the posts on here and I have decided I am finished for good.  Finished with reading these posts for the night and also on the verge of being finished with this website.</p>
<p><br>
What are the men on this website about?  Are the white men on this website about preserving our race, or bashing and degrading their women every chance they get?  Is this website about discussing the virtues and beauty of Western Civilization or is it about talking about how much better Asian women are than white women?</p>
<p>As a white woman, I don&rsquo;t know why I even bother with this website.  Why should any white woman care to be involved with preserving her race when stuff like this is all we read on websites such as this?  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that white men are just as guilty as white women for the failure of current family values and marriage etc&hellip;. Instead of finger pointing at white women and talking about how horrible and repulsive we are, and how nonwhite women are so much better ( I don&rsquo;t see how you can be a true believer in Amren if you claim that garbage)&hellip;instead of all this&hellip;we should be working together as white men and women.</p>
<p>But you know what?  After reading some of the stuff above, I think I am on the verge of being done with this website.  I have had it.  I am sick of it!  I don&rsquo;t hear black men going around talking about how repulsive their women are.  I don&rsquo;t hear hispanic men doing this with their women&hellip;Indian men&hellip;Chinese men&hellip;.etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>Are you for preserving the white race or not?  If you want to take the &#8220;easy&#8221; way out and sleep with Asian women while going on and on about how &#8220;repulsive&#8221; white women are&hellip;then FINE. Just don&rsquo;t post on this website acting as if you care one ounce about your race.</p>
<p>According to statistics, most white men still marry and date white women.  So most white men obviously still prefer white women.  Perhaps, if you haven&rsquo;t been able to find a white woman, there may be some shortcoming on your part.  Ever thought of that?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found the right white man yet ( I am still young)&hellip;but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am going to find myself an Indian or an arab now does it?  Believe me&hellip;I have had MANY bad experiences with white men.  But guess what?  White men are still number one in my book and I wouldn&rsquo;t ever dare come on a website like this and bash them the way a lot of you white men are bashing us.</p>
<p>I have had it!  What a bunch of sorry excuses for men on this website.  I think I am done with this website.  I am sick of this!  The people who post on this website and the people who run it seem to be more interested in fighting the fight with Asian and hispanic women at their side than with white women.</p>
<p>So long&hellip;.I am finished!  I may hopefully have a change of heart in the morning&hellip;.but so long for now!  I am done! Good night!</p>
