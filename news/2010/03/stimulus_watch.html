<h1>Stimulus Watch: Less Stimulus for Minority Firms</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Google News, March 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanic and black businesses are receiving a disproportionately small number of federal stimulus contracts, creating a rising chorus of demands for the Obama administration to be more inclusive and more closely track who receives government-financed work.</p>
<p>Latinos and blacks have faced obstacles to winning government contracts long before the stimulus. They own 6.8 and 5.2 percent of all businesses, respectively, according to census figures. Yet Latino-owned business have received only 1.7 percent of $46 billion in federal stimulus contracts recorded in U.S. government data, and black-owned businesses have received just 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>That pot of money is just a small fraction of the $862 billion economic stimulus law. Billions more have been given to states, which have used the money to award contracts of their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minority businesses are often too small to compete for projects; do not have access to the necessary capital, equipment or bonding requirements; or lose bids to companies with well-established relationships. There also has been an emphasis on spending stimulus money quickly, which favors businesses that have won past contracts.</p>
<p>But minority advocates say that blacks and Latinos have been harder hit by the recession, and getting a fair share of stimulus contracts is key to the recovery of these communities. Unemployment among blacks and Hispanics is much higher than among whites. And although unemployment among whites increased at a faster rate during the worst of the recession than among minorities, rates of those considered underemployed  &mdash;  including people who have given up looking for full-time work or people working part-time because there is no full-time work available  &mdash;  increased faster among minorities than whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six percent of the $16.9 billion in Federal Highway Administration contract money spent by states has gone to disadvantaged business enterprises, which includes companies owned by minorities as well as women, veterans and the disabled, according to department press secretary Olivia Alair.</p>
<p>Out of $1.1 billion in state-spent Federal Aviation Administration contract money, 7.8 percent has gone to disadvantaged businesses, Alair said, and 8.6 percent of direct Transportation Department contract dollars have gone to those companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>LaHood&rsquo;s [Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood] department has pledged $20 million in subsidies to help disadvantaged businesses pay bonding premiums and fees, and has established a short-term loan program that lent $4.9 million in 2009. Last month, LaHood announced $9.9 million in grants to help businesses owned by minorities and women compete for federal contracts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Latino-owned businesses have received 3.7 percent of the guaranteed total, and black-owned businesses 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>The founder and chief executive of one of the nation&rsquo;s largest black-owned construction companies, Richard Copeland of THOR Construction Inc., said minority-owned companies usually employ 60 percent minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can&rsquo;t get on these jobs,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t hire our people from our community, so poverty and drugs and crime and unemployment and welfare become habitual.&#8221; His company has done a small amount of weatherization work through Minnesota stimulus contracts.</p>

		<p>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe minorities were given a back seat to stimulus money is ignorant of what has been going on.  There has been the greatest push ever by this community organizer to elevate blacks any way possible by hook or crook.</p>
<p>This article is just more black whining, hoping to intimidate whitey into giving even more.</p>
<p>Are you fooled?</p>

		<p>If government, especially the &#8220;Federal&#8221; government really wants to help businesses, the best thing they could do would be to leave them alone.  Let government cease taxing business to death.  Let it cease piling so much paperwork on them that they need to hire people just to do the paperwork.  Let the EEOC cease entrapping businesses for &#8220;discrimination&#8221;.  Let the EPA cease entrapping business for &#8220;environmental&#8221; violations. Let the IRS cease hounding and persecuting businesses with their millions of pages of fine print that even they don&rsquo;t understand.  Let OSHA cease making business owner&rsquo;s lives a living hell because of countless technicalities.  All government needs to do is CEASE AND DESIST.  Their lack of action would be far more beneficial than their evil wealth redistribution schemes.</p>

		<p>I swear, these minority (emphasis on that word) organizations all have the ability to put a &#8220;spin&#8221; on why they haven&rsquo;t been able to legitimately qualify for the free money or loans, and they also have no shame about demanding to be made exceptions to the rule so they can get more than they deserve.  They give me such a hemorrhoid!</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money is earmarked for &#8220;minority&#8221; contractors. All big contractors have front minority firms. They just put a woman in the office, or someone&rsquo;s wife down as president and owner and they get the contract anyway. </p>
<p>All these set aside contracts are nothing but legalized corruption, so the contractors are just playing the corruption game.</p>

		<p>I heard about this on the radio. What this article fails to mention is that the federal government is giving money to the states, the states to the municipalities, and so forth. Firms bidding for contracts at these levels win if the make the lowest bid to get the job done. If women and minority firms are not getting the bailout money, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not making the lowest bids. Is this because of discrimination? Because white firms are more &#8220;connected&#8221; or have been in business longer? I doubt it. The ability of new, innovative firms of all kinds to undercut entrenched competition by offering better service cheaper is the backbone of our economic way of life. It happens all the time. This, however, is a clear bid to circumvent both municipal practice (which is meant to protect the taxpayer from corruption) and a basic tenet of the economy. In other words, this is on argument on behalf of awarding contacts not to the firm offering the best deal to the taxpayer but to the firm, regardless of price, deemed worthy of benefitting from a Keynesian redistribution scheme. If women and minority firms want contracts, they have to innovate and undercut prices. Period.</p>
