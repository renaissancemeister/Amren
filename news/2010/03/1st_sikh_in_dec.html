<h1>1st Sikh in Decades Graduates Army Officer School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Roberts, Yahoo! News, March 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The soldiers in standard-issue fatigues and combat boots stood side-by-side repeating their creed {snip}.</p>
<p>Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan was no different except that he wore a full beard and black turban, the first Sikh in a generation allowed to complete U.S. Army basic officer training without sacrificing the articles of his faith. He completed the nine-week training Monday after Army officials made an exemption to a policy that has effectively prevented Sikhs from enlisting since 1984.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rattan had to get a waiver from the Army to serve without sacrificing the unshorn hair mandated by his faith. An immigrant from India who arrived in New York as a teenager, Rattan said he hopes his military commitment will allow him to give back to his adopted home country and will help diminish prejudice Sikhs sometimes face in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Army in 1984 eliminated an exemption that had previously allowed Sikhs to maintain their articles of faith while serving, but officials can issue individual waivers to the uniform policy after considering the effects on safety and discipline, said Army spokesman George Wright. Only a handful of such individual religious exemptions are ever granted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rattan said he encountered no trouble from fellow soldiers during training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During training, Rattan wore a helmet over the small turban, which he doesn&rsquo;t remove, and was able to successfully create a seal with his gas mask despite the beard, resolving the Army&rsquo;s safety concerns, said Harsimran Kaur, the Sikh Coalition&rsquo;s legal director.</p>
<p>Rattan also worked with an Army tailor to create an insignia patch normally worn on soldiers&rsquo; berets that could be affixed to his black turban, she said.</p>
<p>An estimated 300,000 Sikhs live in the United States. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before the Army&rsquo;s regulation change in 1984, Sikhs served in the U.S. military during every major armed conflict going back to World War I. Those who joined before the change were allowed to serve with their beards and turbans, but the policy effectively prevented new enlistment of Sikhs, Kaur said.</p>

		<p>As a former Army officer myself, I have no problem with his beard as long as he&rsquo;s going to be utilized as a spy or liason in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I remember the military allowing beards back in the 1970&rsquo;s and before the 20th Century. <br>
Remember Robert DeNiro in the Deer Hunter?</p>

<p>And if he goes into a combat situation with his turban, and loses it, an enemy will easily be able to grab him by his extra-long hair&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well, the Carter and Clinton appointees in the Pentagon are o.k. with overlooking jihadists who kill their people, making blacks officers, who are practically illiterate, encourage women in combat roles, and lying about Jessica Lynch being a female Rambo when it is later learned she fell to her knees and prayed, so why should we be surprised they&rsquo;re now allowing another anti-Christian, anti-white hater in the military?</p>
<p>And that they offer him an exemption that no other is allowed only adds to the stupidity and insult of the entire matter.</p>
<p>The politically correct military is going to be involved in incidents far more serious than jihadists killing US soldiers.  Entire battles will be lost and even more secrets will be stolen by foreign nationals who have been welcomed by the naive brass and given top secret status only to give out US secrets to their home countries.</p>
<p>Diversity is a weakness, and diversity is dumb, but the weaknesses and stupidity are far greater within the ranks of the pentagon geeks than it is in the diversity ideology they follow.</p>

<p>The Sikhs have actually proven themselves to be most capable soldiers in the past and I think that 1000 Sikhs is better by far than 1 muslim in the U.S. military. Muslims should be banned from the U.S. military service.</p>

		<p>Anyone know what this guy is going to DO in the army?</p>
<p>I think he is a doctor. Presumably NOT going to go into combat or be in a situation where he will need to wear the helmet or put on a gas mask. Will perform duty in an area where such situations will not occur. State-side ONLY perhaps?</p>
<p>The entire Sikh culture is based upon a tradition of men who aspire to the warrior code. But obviously there is a conflict between the wearing of beards and turbans and the U.S. Army regulations.</p>
<p>This has now been overcome? </p>

<p>Not correct. Short hair was initiated with the Army of Republican Rome because long hair could be grabbed by an enemy from in front of a shield and break the integrity of the Roman Phalanx, which at the time, was a major force in the known world.</p>

		<p>Of note: when I was in the Army and after a 49 day out patrol I returned with a sort of beard and was threatened with reduction of grade and Art. 15 BUT! reading revealed that at the time of the Viet Nam war and all before, OFFICERS were required to wear beards so they could be distinguished from EM in times of hectic combat..Charges were dismissed, I shaved and only the enmity of a few stateside officers remained. This requirement may/or may not have been changed&hellip;it was a rather obscure rule in the UCMJ but still held weight.</p>

		<p>&#8220;so why should we be surprised they&rsquo;re now allowing another anti-Christian, anti-white hater in the military?&#8221;   (ranger)</p>
<p>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ </p>
<p>That completely unjustified assumption is really going overboard!  Sikhs have no history of being anti-Christian, nor are they anti-white. In fact,  the Sikhs  developed as a warrior sect in Northern India (the Punjab) that RESISTED the advance of Islam. They have a long tradition as soldiers, and they bitterly fought the Moslems who were trying to impose conversion. The name Singh, which they all have, means &#8220;lion&#8221;. If not for them, all of India would be Moslem today.</p>
<p>But being caught between Islam and Hinduism, they can go both ways, according to what&rsquo;s in their interest. In fact, Sikh guards, sworn to protect Indira Gandhi, the prime minister of India, actually assassinated her over the issue of Sikh independence.  Something to think about, when putting our faith in foreigners to protect us!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what I think about allowing them this exemption in the US military. I&rsquo;m uneasy about it, though I have nothing against Sikhs personally.  But much better, I think, for them to be in their own country where they can can have their own customs, and not be here at all. Then, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any issue about this. At the bottom of it, our immigration policy (and those who created it to destroy white America)&hellip;THAT is the real problem that&rsquo;s endangering us, not Sikhs.</p>

But since you spoke about that community, please tell me when, where, they proved themselves to be most capable? &#8220;In the past&#8221;&hellip;? Do you mean, a long, long time ago, in India?

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Religions have been known to modify their rules, according to time and place, and changing circumstances. </p>
<p>For instances, Catholics relaxed their rule against eating meat on Fridays. They changed the mass from Latin to vernacular.  Mormons modified their position on polygamy;  they have changed their sacred undergarment several times (supposedly never to be altered), and they dropped their exclusion of blacks. And so forth. Jews also have reformed many practices to come out of the Middle Ages and adjust to modern living.  There&rsquo;s nothing in the world that&rsquo;s inflexible.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if Sikhs want to come live here, voluntarily,  in our country (or other societies), they should be prepared to modify their customs to accommodate them to their hosts. Turbans and daggers amd uncut hair may have been the thing in India, 500 years ago, but they are out of place here today. And there is no practical need to justify them either.  </p>
<p>We need to clarify who is in charge in our country. There is too much groveling to &#8220;minorities&#8221;&hellip; even those just just recently arrived.   WE should not have to modify OUR customs to adjust to THEIRS!</p>
<p>I set the rules in my own house. If I do not allow smoking in my house, and you are a smoker, I expect you to show respect for my rules when visiting. If not, you are welcome to leave. You were not kidnapped; no one is holding you against your will. You can just leave.</p>

		<p>1 - The Navy, for a while in the Seventies, allowed beards.  The Army and Marine Corps never did, and one of the inaccuracies in The Deer Hunter was DeNiro&rsquo;s beard.</p>
<p>As for the Sikh, I never saw or heard of one during my time in the Army (&#8216;63-&#8216;68).  I would assume that this guy is an Army doctor.  In any event, wearing the traditional Sikh headgear as a member of a rifle company would provide an irresistible target for a sniper.</p>

<p>Doctors and dentists are subject to deployment the same as all other soldiers. So he could easily find himself in the modern equivalent of a M*A*S*H unit.</p>
<p>Any Hindus in the Army had better watch their backs with this guy around. In 1984 Indian Prime Minister Indira Ghandi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.</p>

		<p>12 Skip: Romans did not fight in the phalanx.  Greek hoplites, heavily armed and armored infantry for that day, fought in tightly packed phalanx formations, with their long hair and beards.  Recall how the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae carefully combed their hair while awaiting the Persian assault.  <br>
     Romans fought in centuries, usually 80 (not 100) men in three or four ranks, which were combined into larger formations.  The century was a much more mobile battle formation than the phalanx, which could not be easily be turned around to face a new threat.  That&rsquo;s why the Romans beat the Greeks.  They didn&rsquo;t need to grab their hair.  </p>
<p>As any look at a photo from the time will show, the U.S. Army allowed beards and long hair in the 1800s.  The short hair was a hygienic measure from the early 1900s.</p>

		<p>I must say, the Sikhs I&rsquo;ve run across have, without exception, been good eggs while being tough as nails.  These cats can FIGHT.  Good shots, too.  Looks like they&rsquo;ve bent the rules to accommodate this one young man, but I&rsquo;m betting he&rsquo;s gooing to be a good soldier.  Sikhs, as a general rule, are eager for an opportunity to zap muslims.  Next stop, NHL!</p>
