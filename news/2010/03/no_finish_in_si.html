			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Anderson, Washington Times, March 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A multibillion-dollar &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; along the southwestern border promised for completion in 2009 to protect the U.S. from terrorists, violent drug smugglers and a flood of illegal immigrants is a long way from becoming a reality, with government officials unable to say when, how or whether it will ever be completed.</p>
<p>More than three years after launching a major border security initiative and forking over more than $1 billion to the Boeing Co., the project&rsquo;s major contractor, Homeland Security Department officials are re-evaluating the high-tech component of the plan in the wake of a series of critical Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports warning lawmakers that the expensive undertaking is deeply flawed.</p>
<p>The program now places the Obama administration in a quandary, foretold by lawmakers who witnessed Boeing and Homeland Security publicly mischaracterize the nature of the contract, according to GAO, after government officials, watchdogs and contractors privately discovered that it was destined to fail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since February 2007, according to a review of federal records by The Washington Times, GAO has been telling Congress and Homeland Security that its high-tech border protection system needed better oversight and accountability, and that it lacked realistic measures of cost, timing and benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite such warnings, based on GAO&rsquo;s detailed evaluations of the root causes of major problems, the goals of the high-tech project, dubbed &#8220;SBInet,&#8221; were not realized and deadlines were pushed back. In September, GAO reported to Congress that the virtual fence scheduled for completion in 2009 will not be ready until at least 2016  &mdash;  if it goes forward at all.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Obama administration has announced significant budget cuts for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) programs that depend on costly manpower, fencing, infrastructure and technology. While Homeland Security has described the virtual fence project as a critical element of increased border security, the administration has requested $574 million for the program for fiscal 2011  &mdash;  a cut of nearly 30 percent compared with the $800 million that Congress approved in fiscal 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was before Congress last week defending a 3 percent cut to the CBP budget, a proposal that has concerned Border Patrol Chief David V. Aguilar, now serving as acting CBP deputy commissioner. {snip}</p>
<p>The chief said the Border Patrol needed to cut new expenditures below commitments it made for the fiscal 2009 budget, adding that while &#8220;significant cuts&#8221; already had been made, additional reductions would be necessary. He directed the sector chiefs to do more with less.</p>
<p>Chief Aguilar also said he &#8220;had to shut down&#8221; some pending and ongoing programs involving the Border Patrol&rsquo;s Enforcement and Information Technology (EIT) Division, which the agency has described as a key component in its ability to secure U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Critics of the border project contend that the Bush administration had two possible goals in launching SBInet, both of which it failed to meet: to build a well-planned, functional, high-tech system of sensors, cameras, radars and a Border Patrol command center; or to move quickly and tout the border security effort as a means of negotiating immigration reform.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite Homeland Security&rsquo;s recent decision to re-evaluate SBInet, department officials and lawmakers charged with oversight were told long ago that the virtual fence was being built on a shaky foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;GAO was on this right from the start,&#8221; Mr. Stana said of SBInet, which was launched in 2006. &#8220;The first problem was the government never came up with detailed requirements for the system; they never talked to the Border Patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Glenn Spencer, president of the American Border Patrol, a private organization that uses airplanes and high-tech equipment to monitor the U.S.-Mexico border, said the virtual fence failed because Homeland Security &#8220;did not set measurable goals for the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boeing didnt really know what to build and [Homeland Security] had no way of knowing if it was working or not,&#8221; said Mr. Spencer, whose board includes two former Border Patrol chiefs. &#8220;The axiom reads: If you cant measure it, you cant improve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Napolitano first announced that the program was under review on Jan. 8, the Friday before a report on SBInet aired on CBS&rsquo; &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; On Wednesday, she signaled in testimony to a Senate committee that SBInet was hanging in the balance, saying that &#8220;before we say we&rsquo;re going to do this along the entire border, we need to re-evaluate and see if there&rsquo;s better technologies that will pair with our actual boots on the ground in a more effective way.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As mentioned before at this web-site, the Virtual Fence was never actually intended to work.  Everyone knew right from the beginning that it would not work and will never work. The real purpose of the Virtual Fence is to transfer Billions of Dollars to Boeing and other &#8220;military-type&#8221; companies, in return for large donations to the political campaigns of our Federal legislators.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to secure the border, they simply build a real fence in a few months, for far less money. But they have no intention of ever securing the border.</p>
<p>Another Billion Dollars of your money wasted.<br>

		<p>&#8220;May be not finished until 2016, if ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.  This country has lost its will to protect its own borders.  It&rsquo;s far too late to worry about trying to secure the perimeters when so many devisive elements are already here.  Allowing more to come in won&rsquo;t tip the scales any further in the direction of insolvency and chaos as has already occurred.</p>
<p>That a radical leftist fringe, completely out-of-touch with reality, was allowed to take control of the White House and Congress signaled the death knell for the American empire.</p>
<p>Worrying about a border fence is like being concerned about closing off the swimming hole after the alligators are inside.</p>

		<p>Maybe all us white Americans could move to Mexico.  Once the country has emptied of all it&rsquo;s Mexicans, of course.  Granted Mexico is a &#8220;fixer upper&#8221; but I think we could make a go of it.  Especially if we learned from our mistakes and didn&rsquo;t let the Mexicans back.</p>
<p>Viva República Del Sur!</p>

		<p>The &#8220;virtual fence&#8221; was never intended to work, any more than &#8220;virtual sex&#8221; results in procreation.  We need a real fence.  Actually two parallel fences, about 20 yards apart, with plenty of land mines and mean dogs in between.</p>

		<p>A &#8216;virtual&rsquo; fence I take will be invisible to the naked eye.<br>
So it&rsquo;s not really a fence then is it?<br>
Call me old fashioned, but I wouldn&rsquo;t feel very safe with a &#8216;virtual fence&rsquo; around my house.</p>
<p>Things that consist of solid matter are more real and reassuring and at least can act as a hurdle.<br>
A King Solomonly way of dealing with this would be to have a Sheriff Joe of Arizona type of character having illegal&rsquo;s building the fence themselves, under strict supervision of course.</p>

		<p>The interesting thing about this is something I became aware of recently in an exchange between Barney Frank (the poster boy for destructive liberalism) and Bernanke.  Bernanke (supposedly an employee) basically put Frank on notice that the fed would not be monetizing any more debt.  Further he told Frank that social security, medicaid and &#8220;entitlement spending&#8221; would be cut.  What is interesting about the exchange is the manner Bernanke took with Frank&hellip;..like a CEO telling a low level subordinate what he is expected to do.</p>
<p>My point is this.  Obama, Frank, Pelosi and the rest are not actually the people who run this country.  They are a bunch of actors on a stage, performing a drama to distract all of us from who actually makes all the decisions.  Want to know who those people are?  Then follow the money to as who profits from the fed.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, these people flooded the US with non-whites.  But something interesting has happened.  The result is probably not what they expected.  It is destroying the source of their profits and power.</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t have any of THAT, can we.  So I suspect the next few years will be marked with intense anti-immigrant sentiment and policy.  If you suddenly see all welfare for non-blacks dry up completely, H1B visas canceled and a militarize border, you will know why.</p>

		<p>The government of India can build a 4,000 kilometer [2,500 mile] long REAL fence, double with razor wire in between, lit at night, patrolled by TROOPS with assault rifle, between the border of India and Bangladesh. But the U.S. government cannot even build a MUCH SHORTER VIRTUAL FENCE!! Well, we all see what is wrong here, don&rsquo;t we??!!</p>
<p>India si, USA NO!</p>

		<p>I will believe in the effectiveness of a virtual fence when the government removes the real fence around the White House and replaces it with a virtual one.  </p>
<p>It is not going to happen.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Oranges&rsquo; could be a metaphor for a rich fruit orchard planted by one hard-working group but subject to raids by another group who can&rsquo;t be bothered to plant and tend their own but rather scream about their &#8216;rights&rsquo; to share in the bounty. These groups could be rather large and noisy, a bit like metaphorical elephants but there are proven ways to deal with the problem. A three-meter fence, anchored by sections of railroad track driven like stakes into the ground, cuts across South Africa&rsquo;s Eastern Cape Province. On one side sits Addo Park, a thriving slice of wilderness containing the largest elephant population in the region. Just meters away on the other side of the fence stands row upon row of orange trees sagging heavily with fruit. This fence might as well separate an oil refinery from a raging brush fire  &mdash;  such is the notorious appetite of elephants for citrus that they would long since have raided those orchards. Only the fence, packing 8,000 volts of gentle persuasion, has protected those trees.</p>

		<p>Yes, I agree that the nation has lost the will to protect its borders or keep illegal migrants out.  I guarantee you that there will be growing seccessionist movements led by whites, and this time, the Federal gov&rsquo;t, led by blacks and latinos, will fight to keep them in.</p>
<p>Imagine that, the new civil war will pit a non-white federal gov&rsquo;t against white rebels in the north and midwest.</p>

		<p>The joke being played on the majority of Americans who have wanted a real, secure southern border for DECADES is infuriating. At some point it will come out that every major effort by the Fed Govt to secure the border was accompanied by a wink and a nudge - &#8220;build that fence&hellip; but take your time and don&rsquo;t do too good of a job&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly what we&rsquo;re seeing here is a major betrayal of the majority white population of this country in the same vein but on an even larger scale than the betrayal of the British people by the Labour Party. In order to drive down wages and win the votes of immigrants, the elite class in this country has sold the rest of us out. Unforgivable.</p>

		<p>Next Washington will claim they have built a &#8220;stealth fence&#8221; that is completely invisible.  </p>
<p>The media will show pictures of unprotected border and claim it&rsquo;s the &#8220;stealth fence&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The same Americans who believe in the honesty of our political elections will believe every word of it&hellip;</p>
