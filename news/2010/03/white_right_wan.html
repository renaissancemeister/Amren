<h1>&#8216;White Right&rsquo; Wants Obama to Be One-Term President, Farrakhan Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, February 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan, boasting his divine stature, on Sunday predicted trouble ahead for President Barack Obama and urged him to do more to improve the lives of blacks and the downtrodden.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old leader said the &#8220;white right&#8221; was conspiring to make Obama a one-term president, and pointed to his stalled efforts to introduce health care legislation as proof. He said those opponents and lobbyists were trapping him into a future war with Iran that could lead to mass destruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;prophet&rsquo; is too cheap a word. I am a light in the midst of darkness,&#8221; Farrakhan said at the annual convention of the movement that embraces black nationalism. &#8220;It ain&rsquo;t ego, it&rsquo;s my love for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>An estimated 20,000 people attended the heavily guarded Saviours&rsquo; Day event at the United Center in Chicago. Followers  &mdash;  men dressed in navy uniforms and women in white skirt suits with matching hijabs  &mdash;  cheered on Farrakhan with shouts of &#8220;Allahu Akbar,&#8221; Arabic for &#8220;God is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrakhan spent most of the fiery nearly four-hour speech recounting a 1985 vision he had in Mexico. Farrakhan has often described how he believes he was invited aboard an unidentified flying object he calls &#8220;the wheel&#8221; where he said he heard the late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad speak to him.</p>
<p>He said that experience led him to inklings about future events, including the United States&rsquo; 1986 bombing of Libya.</p>
<p>Farrakhan recounted how his divine knowledge has allowed him to recognize countless warning signs over the decades  &mdash;  such as natural disasters such as the earthquake in Chile  &mdash;  and said they indicate impending trouble, including for Obama.</p>

Farrakhan has often described how he believes he was invited aboard an unidentified flying object he calls &lsquo;the wheel&rsquo; where he said he heard the late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My biggest problem with the &ldquo;minister&rdquo; Farrakhan, has always been that he holds back so much about his visions. Look, we all know what white &ldquo;deviltry&rdquo; is capable of because we normally get out cosmic marching orders from our &ldquo;creator&rdquo; Dr. Yakub, when we drink our morning coffee tainted with milk to whiten its original ebony richness for our evil magic. Moreover, It is well known, that we can hyper-enhance our powers from Dr. Yakub, by eating beef (from cows, which produce the blackness tainting nectar we call milk) and when that is mixed with chicken meat (since these birds drop eggs, that are encased in a white shell and surround by a yellow yolk) allows us to grow wings and attack &ldquo;the wheel&rdquo;  and request Asian aid while doing so. </p>
<p>Think about it, with all the above truths in mind, Farrakhan must be a Dr. Yakub plant or crazy, or even both?</p>
<p>Just look at what has happened with Journey and this song, and draw your own conclusions: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6P8gDHqTA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=635F7B9F3E4194C2&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=40" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd6P8gDHqTA&feature;=PlayList&p;=635F7B9F3E4194C2&playnext;=1&playnext;_from=PL&index;=40</a></p>
<p>Arnel Pineda debuting with this song in Chile with Journey, just has to be through eggs and Dr. Yakub relentlessly attempting to destroy the Nation of Islam and &ldquo;the wheel .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allahu akbar and may &ldquo;the prophet,&rdquo;  help us all!!!</p>

<p>Yes, we DEFINITELY do want to make this character a one term president, but we&rsquo;d rather impeach him right now.</p>
<p>Please know that if this man gets re-elected the country as we know it will be a replica of the black power movement, for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>Even now, in spite of the falling economy this pro-black community organizer is doing all he can to try to shift the balance of power to blacks.  He IS being restrained to some extent now, because he wants to serve a second term.  If he does, all the stops are gone.  There will be nothing to really stop him from going all out for black power.</p>
<p>Look for him to initiate the construction of his, &#8220;Civilian army that will be as strong and as well-funded as the military.&#8221;</p>
<p>We could all be under the watchful eye of Acorn and Calypso Louie&rsquo;s black Muslims.  Please believe me, that is no exaggeration.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t you see what is coming?  Based on current political trends, it seems likely that Obama will be denied his rightful opportunity to be &#8220;the historic first African American president who the American people wanted to serve three or more terms, but the raciss constitution limited them to electing him to only two terms, but the raciss Tea Partiers, Birthers, and Rich White Republicans, Nazis all, denied him his rightful opportunity for his second term.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he isn&rsquo;t reelected, the race hate machine will crank into its highest gear since the Civil Rights Movement (called &#8220;struggle&#8221; by liberal white elites who want to remind us that we are evil whites whose racism made blacks &#8220;struggle&#8221; for what we should have given them back in 1789).</p>
<p>Whites in Our White American Nation will be vilified as never before, and violent riots will probably break out wherever you find black churches and mosques.  America will be declared worldwide as the Nation Too Raciss to Reelect Its Greatest President Ever to His Rightful Second Term.</p>
<p>Race hate will rage on as never before. We are moving to a day of cataclysm, just as we were warned from 1800 (Prosser&rsquo;s Rebellion) through to the noble white struggle against forced racial amalgamation and miscegenation through government controlled integration.</p>
<p>In our lifetimes, we will witness the coming true of all the horrific prophecies made by our people&rsquo;s historic race realists.  And the fact that will be hushed into oblivion is that we, the whites, won&rsquo;t be the ones to start the fight.<br>
We will be blamed for everything by our own people.  </p>

		<p>While I would agree with many that our current health care system is badly broken, I believe I have legitimate fears that government run health care will wind up working about as well as our government run schools do.  This has nothing to do with racism.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be any happier if Hillary Clinton was president and pushing the same program.</p>
<p>The basic problem with health care is that it gets more expensive each year by much more than the inflation rate.  Every businessman who pays for his employees&rsquo; health insurance knows this.  So obviously the first step is to have some capable and objective accountants carefully follow the money each step of the way and explain <i>why</i> the prices have to keep going up.  Only then will we have any basis for figuring out what to do about the high cost of health care.  But this first step hasn&rsquo;t been done.  So the politicians are doing what they always do   &mdash;   applying the wrong solution to a problem they don&rsquo;t understand.  Farrakhan, who is very much a white hater and a Jew hater himself, says I&rsquo;m a racist for having these sensible views.</p>
<p>Not only do I hope Obama is a one term president but I wish that Dubya had been a zero term president.  The best thing about white politicians is that you can dislike them without being labeled a racist.</p>

		<p>Notice that this racist psychopath is able to attrack 20,000 like minded psychopaths in Chicago and 1 MILLION in Washington, and not a word from the limp wristed &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; that protested and caused the cancellation of the Amren conventions.</p>
<p> They know full well that had they tried to disrupt a Farrakhan gathering, they would&rsquo;ve never made it out alive. Can you imagine what would happen if a group of Whites stood up in the middle of the crowd and shouted out at Farrakhan and then try to shove him off the stage! The movie &#8220;Jaws&#8221; comes to mind.</p>
<p>I still get satisfaction knowing that when ole Louie got cancer awhile back, he sure did run to the &#8220;right White&#8221; dr. to save his butt.</p>

		<p>Hannity on FoxNews is discussing Farrakhan&rsquo;s comments. The hottie chick said we shouldn&rsquo;t give Farrakan attention because he is divisive and we&rsquo;ve come so far in this country that we just don&rsquo;t need divisiveness.</p>
<p>Shame on here for thinking that it is good that we&rsquo;ve come so far. Getting here where Southerners aren&rsquo;t blatantly racisss in public has come at the cost of our liberty and freedom. Forced integration, civil rights, affirmative action, diversity quotas, multiculturalism, non stop illegal immigration, Obamanation, all was forced upon us at the point of a loaded gun.</p>
<p>Those who are aware of the facts welcome divisiveness, because divided is how we started and divided is how we will recover our strength.  </p>

Now on Fox TV is advertisement for tickets to the African Children&rsquo;s Choir.  We are supposed to buy tickets to help the &#8220;plight of children in Africa.&#8221;   </p>

<p>White people in the white USA are the most plighted of all the races. Save Yourself First.</p>

		<p>Is it just me or does Farrakhan keep getting crazier and crazier.</p>
<p>The funny thing about this is I&rsquo;m a person that has experience with the supernatural in Christianity.  I KNOW actual prophets.  They tend to be very humble, low key people.  Meek is the word here.  My pastor recently said something very interesting about the term &#8220;meek&#8221;.  Meek is power under control.  That describes a real prophet.  Power under control.  Completely unassuming.  But, boy, when the situation calls for it, do they manifest power.  REAL power of the type that crazy people like Farrakhan can only dream about.</p>

A popular bar had a new robotic bartender installed. A man enters and orders a martini. The robot serves him a perfectly prepared cocktail, and then asks him, &#8220;What&rsquo;s your IQ?&#8221; </p>
<p>The man replies &#8220;150&#8221; and the robot proceeds to make conversation about quantum physics, string theory, and advanced medical technology. </p>
<p>The customer is very impressed and thinks, &#8220;This is really cool.&#8221; He decides to test the robot. He walks out of the bar, turns around and comes back in for another drink. Again, the robot serves him the drink and asks him, &#8220;What&rsquo;s your IQ?&#8221; </p>
<p>This time the guy responds, &#8220;100.&#8221; </p>
<p>Immediately the robot starts talking about football, NASCAR, Budweiser and John Deere tractors. <br>
Really impressed, the man leaves the bar and decides to give the robot one more test. He goes back in, the robot serves him and asks, &#8220;What&rsquo;s your IQ?&#8221; <br>
The man replies, &#8220;uh &hellip; 50.&#8221; <br>
The robot leans in real close and says, &#8220;So, you people still happy you voted for Obama?&#8221; </p>
<p>I found this on one of the AR links and liked it.</p>

The very same pack of devious, lying, mass murdering, conniving snakes who &#8216;neo-conned&rsquo; us into an illegal, unprovoked and clearly criminal war against Iraq - are, indeed, trying their level best to pressure us into another war, this time against Iran.</p>

		<p>Minister Farrakhan is most likely the smartest man in politics. He was playing the violin by age 3 when he was on the Ed Sullivan show. He along with John Adams,John Quincy Adams and about 5 odd Supreme Court Justices graduated from Boston Latin School, the hardest high schools on the planet, since ruined by affirmative action. He believes in separation of the races, economically, politically and sexually. His schools work and compete intellectually with America`s richest prep schools. His followers believe in the right to keep and bear arms and their children love God and their parents. America would be the envy of all mankind if all American blacks were Muslims like the Minister.<br>

<p>Forgive me, I&rsquo;m not that familiar with the US political system, but isn&rsquo;t this what the opposition is SUPPOSED to do?  Or am I missing something?  I&rsquo;m sure that if McCain had won the election, Louis F would be doing his level best to ensure that he only served one term, too.<br>
Here in Britain, we&rsquo;re just beginning to latch on to the fact that Saint Obama doesn&rsquo;t like us.  I mean REALLY doesn&rsquo;t like us.  The liberal left (including the leaderships of all three main parties) are still in something of a state of denial about this, as the cult of Obama-worship probably remains stronger over here than in the USA.<br>
God bless America, our last best hope.</p>

		<p>Farrakhan should be more worried about the left not the right.  Many White people voted for Obama because they erroneously believed he wasn&rsquo;t one of our alien elite&rsquo;s hand puppets and it looks as though the status quo remains.  The nation&rsquo;s been fleeced for 3 trillion dollars, those troops are still in Iraq, the neocons still control foreign policy and Hillary Clinton recently said that they&rsquo;ll probably be there for fifty or sixty years!!!  I respect Farrakhan to a point in that he wants an African homeland for his people and that&rsquo;s something we should all agree on.  As much as he launches scathing attacks on our overlords, I&rsquo;m puzzled why he doesn&rsquo;t see that Obama is nothing more than a surrogate placed in the White House to do their bidding.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Thanks for mentioning that the hate group NOI gets to hold their hate Whitey rally in a sports stadium. And dont forget that NOI is also a serial killing hate group,the one that orchestrated the Zebra  Murders in the 1970s, that lasted several years, killed dozens in the Bay Area, and hundreds nationwide.</p>

<p>Mr. Tiffany! do you have any idea of what the muslim agenda is for the NON MUSLIM world? And never mind the august schools you say he (farakhan) attended, he is a murderer and went uncharged for a blatant murder in D.C. in the black D.C. riots. I was there, pulled out of the jungles of SEA and brought to D.C. for the riots with other SF, Marine Recon and Rangers&hellip;No sir, he IS NOT a good man, he is a typical black thug with a lot of influence.</p>

Minister Farrakhan is most likely the smartest man in politics. He was playing the violin by age 3 when he was on the Ed Sullivan show. He along with John Adams,John Quincy Adams and about 5 odd Supreme Court Justices graduated from Boston Latin School, the hardest high schools on the planet, since ruined by affirmative action. He believes in separation of the races, economically, politically and sexually. His schools work and compete intellectually with America`s richest prep schools. His followers believe in the right to keep and bear arms and their children love God and their parents. America would be the envy of all mankind if all American blacks were Muslims like the Minister.<br>

But Farrakhan is a hypocrite like most black nationalists.  What, they hate whites and think we&rsquo;re devils, yet they wouldn&rsquo;t be as successful as they are without living in a white country.  He tells his black followers that whites are evil, yet he uses American-made institutions and he lives in a white neighborhood.  If he was a true black nationalist  &mdash;  and if the other black nationalists really were  &mdash;  they&rsquo;d move to Liberia, which was set up for blacks.  </p>

<p>And make a huge DEADtroit out of an already non-functional society. Liberia, Nigeria, Ethopia, Zim and Somalia/Somaliland are made fun of by the real black Africans I work with here in Afghan as total social failures, which of course they are. I like that sometimes in the press one sees Liberia&rsquo;s financial and governmental problems as being because it is an &#8220;emerging, fledgling economy&#8221; It has been a nation for some time I believe, almost as long as the U.S.</p>
