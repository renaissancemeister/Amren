<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article7069255.ece">Rise in Marriages Between Cousins &#8216;Is Putting Children&rsquo;s Health at Risk&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frances Gibb, Times of London, March 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The dangers of marriage between first cousins are to be highlighted by a leading professor, with a warning that their children are at risk of genetic defects.</p>
<p>Baroness Deech, a family law professor and crossbencher, will call next week for a &#8220;vigorous&#8221; public campaign to deter the practice, which is prevalent in Muslim and immigrant communities and on the rise. She will reignite a debate started five years ago when Ann Cryer, MP for Keighley, drew attention to the number of disabled babies being born in the town and called for cousin marriage to be stopped.</p>
<p>Fifty-five per cent of British Pakistanis are married to first cousins and in Bradford the figure is 75 per cent. British Pakistanis represent 3 per cent of all births in Britain but one third of children with recessive disorders.</p>
<p>Lady Deech will also warn that marriage between first cousins can be a barrier to the integration of minority communities. In a lecture she will call for testing for genetic defects where such marriages are arranged and the keeping of a register of people who carry genetic diseases, so that two carriers are not introduced. &#8220;Some variant of this could be possible in cities such as Bradford with a high density of immigrant population,&#8221; she will say.</p>
<p>Lady Deech, who chaired the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority for eight years, will also suggest that married first cousins use invitro fertilisation so that embryos can be tested for recessive diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human rights and religious and cultural practices are respected by not banning cousin marriage,&#8221; she will argue. &#8220;But those involved must be made aware of the consequences.&#8221; Her comments will be made at the Museum of London in the last of a series of family law lectures that she has given under the auspices of Gresham College. Other topics have included marriage, divorce law, cohabitation and gay partnerships; last week she argued that children do better in two-parent families of different genders.</p>
<p>&#8220;The local estimate was that 75 per cent of Bradford disabled children had cousin parents and the rate of cousin marriage in the UK Pakistani community is increasing,&#8221; Lady Deech will say.</p>
<p>In Birmingham, another city with a substantial immigrant community, Lady Deech notes that 10 per cent of the children of first cousins die in infancy or have a disability.</p>
<p>She will note that the practice has always been associated with immigrants and the poor and is &#8220;at odds with freedom of choice, romantic love and integration&#8221;. But factors linked to cousin marriage in the British immigrant community are working against what she calls its &#8220;otherwise inevitable decline&#8221;.</p>
<p>One is finance: such marriages can be arranged to settle debts. Another is financial support of relatives abroad. A third is that it provides a &#8220;ready-made framework of supportive family members for a new immigrant spouse&#8221;; and a fourth is that it enables relatives to migrate to Britain as a fiancé or spouse.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, it is also said to underpin clan loyalty and to accompany nepotism, she argues.</p>
<p>But cousin marriage can be a barrier to integration of immigrant communities and &#8220;arguably to democracy as we know it abroad&#8221;. It also carries genetic problems that can be &#8220;replicated generation after generation, with accumulated suffering in an extended family&#8221;. But Lady Deech does not favour a ban on first-cousin marriages such as one that exists in US states.</p>
<p>&#8220;The State would have to show that it had compelling reasons to limit the right to marry and that the means are related to the goal.&#8221; But there are compelling arguments to act on health grounds. Personal health is the &#8220;fetish of the late 20th century&#8221; and people are targeted over food safety, drink, smoking, alcohol and exercise.</p>
<p>Yet there are cultural differences or ignorance about disabled children, she says. Women may be blamed in some minority cultures for being childless or having disabled children; while the &#8220;Muslim view .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is that it is a consequence of Allah&rsquo;s will, and they may therefore approach it with fatalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lady Deech calls for measures short of a ban to prevent the genetic problems arising from cousin marriage.</p>
<p>She says: &#8220;There is no reason, one could argue, why there should not be a campaign to highlight the risks and the preventative measures, every bit as vigorous as those centring on smoking, obesity and Aids.&#8221; While there was reluctance to &#8220;target or upset Muslims over cousin-marriage issues&#8221; the practice was not mandated by religion, only permitted, so it is not at heart a religious issue, she argues.</p>
<p>A campaign of education needs to start in schools so they understand about genetics and what it means to carry a mutant gene, Lady Deech says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where marriages are arranged, it is possible to test for carrier status and record the results, without stigmatising individuals.&#8221; In the Orthodox Jewish community young people are screened for Tay-Sachs disease, a recessive genetic disorder that prevents mental and physical development, but not given the result. When a match is proposed, a register is checked to ensure two young people who are carriers are not introduced. &#8220;Some variant of this could be possible in cities such as Bradford, with a high density of immigrant population&#8221;, she argues. Finally she suggests in-vitro embryo testing: ethical objections about this being a slippery slope to eugenics are met by current guidelines under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, she says.</p>
<p>Inayat Bunglawala, of the Muslim Council of Britain, welcomed Lady Deech&rsquo;s comments. He said that cousin marriage was popular even though Islamic teaching encouraged wedlock outside the immediate family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly education has an important role to play in this area. There are clear dangers in marrying a close relative, which need to be better understood. Professor Deech&rsquo;s recommendation appear to be sensible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mrs Cryer said: &#8220;It is essential that we discuss this issue. We have been told to be careful, as discussing it could cause deep offence. Blow that, it does not matter. If people wish to be offended, they will be offended.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I visit a lot of hospitals in some of these thir world areas that used to be British - Luton,Bradford and Birmingham. I didn&rsquo;t need this pointing out. When you walk on a ward and every bed is an Asian child you work it out for yourself.</p>
<p>3% of births and 33% of birth defects   &mdash;   of course this is not a drain on the NHS, even though the Pakistani immigrants are disproportionately accepting state benefits also.</p>
<p>Something like 4% ( another minority) of the population is suspect in 59% of rape cases.</p>
<p>Wonder if anybody will start to do anything about it. Diversity is a strength, remember?</p>

		<p>Same thing is happening in Australia:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yq37pc" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/yq37pc</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A study at Auburn Hospital [Sydney] found almost 20 per cent of pregnant women admitted to the maternity ward in one year were married to their first or second cousins.</p>
<p>The research found babies were three times more likely to be born with birth defects and six times more likely to die in the womb or in infancy than babies in the general population&hellip;</p>
<p>Fifteen babies bom to consanguineous couples – related by birth – at Auburn Hospital had severe defects, including heart, kidney and liver function problems. </p>
<p>Among non-cousin couples there were five disabled babies – one with a cleft lip and two with club feet. Of those babies that died – six in total – all were bom to consanguineous couples. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What was interesting,&rdquo; de Costa wrote at the time, &ldquo;was that the proportion of pregnant women who were consanguineously married had risen from 11 per cent in the 1980s to 19.6 per cent in 1999. </p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words.. .consanguineous marriage is continuing to be commonly practised by the next generation. Accurate information about risks and non-judgemental genetic counselling need to be available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So once again Western countries pay for Muslim backwardness and ignorance.</p>

		<p>Personally I could care less how non-whites procreate so long as they do it amongst themselves. If they are going to be leaching off of our society, let them at least not breed with our peoples.</p>
<p>They can marry their grandmothers for all I care. </p>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t teach Pakis anything. Also, if we remember&hellip;the European &#8220;royals&#8221; had quite a lot of those problems having been inbred themselves to consolidate their power. I believe German, Spanish, English, Danish and Portuguese royals were at one time related by being married to one another. These sorts of pairings are of course against the laws of nature and are laws for a reason. Muslims don&rsquo;t care though.</p>

		<p>C.Konev wrote at 10:22 PM on March 24: Re Jerry Lee Lewis. Not quite correct. Jerry Lee Lewis arrived in England with his wife (legal in his home state in USA although not in all states) who was under 16 years old at the time and therefore not permitted to have sex according to UK law which still stands! They were refused permission to share a hotel room. He was not thrown out or banned but if he had insisted on sleeping with an underage girl he could have been charged with rape as she would have been deemed below the age of consent, first cousin or not. His agent was warned about this prior to his arrival but the situation certainly provoked a huge amount of publicity (much of it in the form of protests outside the venue) in the early days of his trans-Atlantic tour. </p>

		<p>Consanguineous marriages have apparently been causing declines in most of the world&rsquo;s Arabic nations for centuries.  People who thwart nature&rsquo;s laws are doomed to extinction, period.</p>

		<p>It is true that marriage out of the family is actually what Islam prefers (if you go to the actual religious sources from the ancient times), but the cousin marriage thing is prevalent precisely for the reasons outlined in the article.  There is another, bigger reason, though: keeping wealth in the family.  I know Pakistanis and Arabs who have done this and their kids are 70% &#8216;tards.  They don&rsquo;t realize that wealth dissipates in the hands of morons!</p>

		<p>Correction of #3: The woman was not Lewis&rsquo; first cousin. According to diverse sources she was a third cousin, first cousin once removed, or a second cousin (removed). </p>

		<p>Despite the many obvious drawbacks to first cousin marriage it is actually beneficial for many of the women.</p>
<p>Women have virtually no rights and are subject to abuse in Pakistan. They enter houses with mother in laws that rule with an iron fist and other extended family members can also be cruel. They are LESS likely to be abused if they are related.</p>
<p>She may hardly see her family if they are unrelated, but if the families are related her family can offer more support and her inlaws see her as sharing the same genes which further lessens the likelihood of abuse.</p>
