<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE public has rejected plans to massively boost Australia&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>The federal government wants to increase the population from 22 million to 35 million by 2050, largely through immigration.</p>
<p>But a poll has found three-quarters of respondents think Australia does not have the services or infrastructure to cope with more people.</p>
<p>More than 60 per cent wanted immigration slowed.</p>
<p>And a majority of the 1000 people surveyed by Essential Research late last month thought the environment was too fragile to cope with more people, and there was not enough space for them.</p>
<p>The government wants to boost the population because it means more young taxpayers to pay for the high costs of an ageing population.</p>
<p>But the public aren&rsquo;t buying the economic argument either  &mdash;  just over half of those surveyed thought more people would not help the economy.</p>
<p>The poll also found that just over half the respondents  &mdash;  51 per cent  &mdash;  approved of the government&rsquo;s plan to means test the rebate for private health cover. A third of respondents opposed the plan.</p>
<p>The government wants to wind back the rebate for single people earning more than $75,000 and couples earning more than $150,000 a year.</p>
<p>Support for the move, which is in trouble in the Senate, was stronger among Labor voters and those on low and middle incomes.<br>

		<p>Australia can&rsquo;t support more people.  In spite of its huge size, most of the island continent is not arable, and outside of a few fortunate areas, water is always a big concern.  The more people you add, the more sprawled out the cities need to be, and since Australia&rsquo;s big five cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth) are all built on the arable land, expanding them only takes away arable land, and removes them from food production.  Since Australia is a zillion miles away from anywhere, this means they have to export more food, which would start out more expensive because of the transoceanic transport costs.</p>

<p>Too bad that immigration to boost revenue has backfired in Europe where the extra costs associated with importing warm bodies has proven to be a burden on their societies.</p>
<p>It makes a person wonder if these government geeks understand that the rioting, terrorism, crime, and social expenses for these third world hordes cost them far more than any benefits&hellip;if there are any benefits, which is doubtful.  </p>
<p>I truly believe these elitists are just too stupid to know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>

		<p>A few quick thoughts:</p>
<p>1) The idea that high levels of immigration will counter-act an aging population is the biggest canard out there these dyas. Immigrants do not exist in a vaccuum. The immigrant brings in his own (and often elderly) dependents and these consume enormous resources.</p>
<p>2) Although Australia looks like a huge country on a map or atlas, its ecumene is very small. I doubt it can support such an increase.</p>
<p>3) EVEN IF such an increase was considered desireable, why not work to raise the birthrate instead? There would be no need for adjustments, or assimilation concerns. Just encourage Australians to have larger families.</p>

		<p>The elites are not stupid. The policy to reduce Whites to a minority in their homelands is a deliberate measure. The idea is to end the homogenous nature of a population to make any mass movement to resist the elites an impossibility. A racially diverse society will always have tension and conflict that the elites can manipulate to their own benefit. Divide and conquer. The citizens will distrust each other more than the authorities and the media circus will pour fuel on the fire. More and more conflict means less freedom and less everyday security. A person can&rsquo;t walk down the street without looking over their shoulder. A citizen can&rsquo;t speak his mind above  a whisper and hopes his confidants will not rat him out to his boss. What a society we live in!! Something has to give someday. </p>

		<p>Australia support more people?  As in immigrants?  Ha!  Let me tell you about my niece in law&rsquo;s brother - he married an Australian girl, and they now have 7 kids, because in Australia you get something like $400 per kid per month if you make under a certain amount; and my niece&rsquo;s brother, bless his heart, has no intention of ever working.  Why should he - his wife works, and the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t is giving them a nice support to her income, and they&rsquo;re getting along just peachy.  I would imagine that there are a whole lot of other folks just dying to become immigrants to Australia so they can do just like my niece&rsquo;s brother&hellip;.</p>

		<p><b>The government wants to boost the population because it means more young taxpayers to pay for the high costs of an ageing population.</b></p>
<p>Government and its employees - who in the United States make far more in wages and benefits than their employers, the taxpayers, do - no longer see themselves as existing to serve the people, but see the people as existing to serve them.</p>
<p>An EEOC lawyer in the Justice Department sees the number of real discrimination cases in decline, so he lobbies to broaden the rules of what qualifies as discrimination, and gets his department to produce biased &#8220;studies&#8221; to prove there&rsquo;s all sorts of discrimination. A school district superintendent sees the number of students in his district in decline, so he supports mass immigration from the Third World to boost his head count. I can&rsquo;t count the number of articles - it must be dozens - where I&rsquo;ve read that immigrant populations in cities from North Dakota to Italy have &#8220;saved&#8221; the local schools in their towns (in spite of their dirt poor educational performance). Schools don&rsquo;t exist to be &#8220;saved.&#8221; They don&rsquo;t need to exist at all if there aren&rsquo;t any children (sad as that may be) to fill the desks. Great God, our countries have gone crazy. The Civil Service system and anti-discrimination laws have made it absolutely impossible to fire our so-called &#8220;public servants.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There are extra costs for an aging population, there are extra costs for a young population, there are extra costs for an increased population (think of all the roads and other infratructure that must be built). No matter what happens to the population, something will be not quite perfect. There is no perfect solution. Everything involves trade-offs. Are the costs of giving away your country to foreigners and taking it away from your own flesh and blood worth a few extra pennies a week in your old age?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a not-too-unreasonable idea - instead of bringing in immigrants to take care of the old folks, send the immigrants off to the nicer parts of Indonesia, the Phillipines and India to be taken care of by low-cost natives living in their homeland. Those countries aren&rsquo;t too far from Oz, and they have great weather and beaches, just like Florida. The country saves a ton of money in health care and pension costs by having it done in places with lots of cheap labor, and the old folks get a higher bang for their buck. Hell, the Phillipines already exports tons of nurses.</p>

		<p>Good to see that our situation is mentioned in the Amren Blog.</p>
<p>The general public here ARE strongly against further immigration especially from the 3rd world, Asian or Islamic Countries. Do the politicians take any notice, OF COURSE NOT!</p>
<p>Most migrants want to come to Sydney which is literally bursting at the seams, and yes we do have serious water shortages and have had to resort to desalination. We also have totally unaffordable house prices (in Sydney).We also have ethnic ghettos and serious ethnic crime problems as well</p>
<p>Outside of Sydney housing is affordable but there are few jobs especially for young people, yet the government keeps saying we need more immigrants.It has been pointed out that some 3rd world migrants are doing the terrible jobs such as working in country based meat proccessing works.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that Australia is a BIG place, yes, but mainly unihabitable and huge areas have been returned to traditional owners.(That is another story&hellip;)</p>
<p>The government tries to sooth the race issue by saying most immigrants come from Great Britain! Not quite so, GB 18%, followed by China 17% followed by India 16% and so on.It has been noted that many migrants who arrive under UN refugee obligations often go back to the country they have escaped from for a holiday!</p>
<p>We have one big advantage over the UK and US re illegal migrants, we are surrounded by the Indian &amp; Pacific Oceans.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t decide who are more stupid, the white Brits  or the white Aussies. They say they want less or no immigration from 3ird world dumps but they keep voting in their suicidal liberal sellout political parties while vilifying as &#8220;racists&#8221; (to the left&rsquo;s delight) people like Pauline Hanson and others who try to save their country. Oh no, they can&rsquo;t have a &#8220;right wing&#8221; or &#8220;extremist&#8221; anti-immigration political party, that would show how intolerant &amp; racist they are. So a future with bloody ethnic &amp; racial stiff and economic depression will be their children&rsquo;s future so they can feel are nice and fuzzy good-hearted now. Stupid.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s become overly obvious that majority-white nations do not benefit from the importation of third-worlders.  The latter are, as others here have detailed, a huge drain on the social system.  I can only surmise that these immigrants are wanted for cheap labor (as they definitely are in the U.S.).  <br>
Why doesn&rsquo;t Australia push a program to get whites from the sub-Saharan and other areas where the ethnically European are under siege?</p>

		<p>12 Dr M:  I understand that the cost of living in Sydney has gotten so expensive that the typical white middle to upper middle class native born white Australian has to live quite a distance away, e.g. Wollongong, to be able to have affordable housing.  Some even live as far south as Nowra and commute back and forth to Sydney, a two-hour one way trip.</p>
<p>14 Martel:  They were harassing Pauline Hanson so badly that she exiled herself to England.  (I know, frying pan fire).  One of the things they were hounding her about was that she appeared in a skin mag wearing very little when she was 19 years old.  Well, surprise of all surprises!  Here&rsquo;s hoping that she&rsquo;s the most successful Australia-to-England export since the soap opera Neighbours.</p>

<p>Although no economics expert, I&rsquo;ve never bought this argument.  But even if it were true, third-world immigration is a recipe for long-term disaster.  The track record for multiethnic states throughout history has been an abysmal one, and yet the hostile elite of western countries continue this insane course.    </p>

<p>Australia has the great misfortune to have a Labour government, but it was the Labour Party, a century and more ago, which agitated for the White Australia policy (of blessed memory) so as to protect white workers from cheap foreign labour.

		<p>TAKE ACTION AGAINST SUCH  POLITICIANS.</p>
<p>1. Australia is a democracy.  The elected reps are supposed to obey the people and carry out their will.  That is their job. That is what they are elected for.<br>
2. The public does not want more immigration.  The pubic decides.<br>
3. Politicians who defy the will of the people are doing so because they must be taking bribes. In essence they are:</p>
<p>a.  engaging in criminal breach of trust.<br>
b.  dereliction of duty.<br>
c.  insubordination to the will of their employers (their public).<br>
d.  Treason.</p>
<p><br>
Solution:</p>
<p>1.  Amend consitution to allow national referenda.<br>
2.  Ban immigration through national referenda.<br>
3.  Try govt. servants who did not obey their masters (the people) for treason, criminal breach of trust, and corruption and crime against humanity (allowing in immigration).</p>

		<p>&#8220;We must hang together, gentlemen &hellip; else, we shall most assuredly hang separately&#8221;, said Benjamin Franklin. It&rsquo;s obvious that patriotic whites are being attacked by a divide and conquer strategy. We are taught to feel isolated in our own countries and not express solidarity with fellow whites in other countries. We can greatly increase our strength if we support white organizations in other countries as well as our own. What happens to whites in Australia or Britain affects the fate of whites in Canada or the US.</p>

		<p>A few posters have mentioned the issue of arable land and fresh water as limiting factors on the australia population.</p>
<p>You have to be really careful here.  The world is on the cusp of nuclear fusion power&hellip;..very cheap, portable, virtually unlimited centralized power that does not pollute.  They have a WORKING reactor already.  Soon (couple of years maybe) they will have the prototype of a usable energy source.  How long until that is mass produced?  Not long.</p>
<p>My point is such a thing makes large scale desalination doable, even cheap.  That is a BIG problem for a place like australia where the government wants mass third world immigration but can&rsquo;t afford to import the food or produce the water.</p>
<p>Unless you settle this issue politically, now, you might wake up to find yourself displaced overnight.  The excuse they will use is that the &#8220;livable&#8221; percentage of australia has expanded dramatically so there is now room for everyone. </p>

		<p>The heading should read, &#8216;Australians don&rsquo;t want anymore Muslim or other third world migrants&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Australia has accepted over 7 million migrants since WW2 and also over 750,000 refugees. Most of these migrants and refugees prior to the mid 70&rsquo;s assimilated into Australian society but sine the Immigration Restrictions Act 1901 was repealed in the mid 70&rsquo;s there has only been disaster. </p>
<p>Now we over 80% of our migrant intake from the third world and the place is really starting to suffer. Over 35% of new migrants end up on the dole, rorting the taxpayer. The Fabian Labor Govt. is happy for these bludgers to come here as they are natural born Socialists and will support Labor through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Australians are against third world immigration and multiculturalism just like our Brothers and Sisters in other Western lands. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with British, American or other white people coming here as they are similar in most ways and would find it easier to assimilate. The problem lies with the mix - too many third worlders accepted while access is denied to productive would be migrants.</p>
<p>Aussies pls. go to www.protectionist.net.</p>
<p>Good on you John Bell. Appreciate the support. Here&rsquo;s to Nick Griffin and Geert Wilders kicking some left wing in the upcoming elections. At the end of the day, it is up to us - the citizens of the West to take matters into our own hands. Our left wing Govts. have destroyed so much, it is up to us to beat them.</p>

<p>That is unlikely to happen. In my years of observing whites, I have concluded that the qualities that enabled them to build advanced civilizations, are also the same qualities that prevent whites from having racial solidarity. White individualism and nationalism, matter more than white racial solidarity, in the eyes of most whites. Whites are just too competitive at the individual and national level, that the idea that they would come together in racial unity against non-whites, is unthinkable.</p>
<p>When whites ruled the entire non-white world in 1913, instead of coming together with a long-term plan on how they were going to maintain their global dominance, they were too busy plotting how to undermine their fellow whites and steal their territories. In the following year, 1914, whites embarked on an orgy of slaughtering each other in Europe.</p>
<p>When a white man makes billions, instead of kicking back and enjoying the money he has made, he is too busy trying to make even more money. The only way he will stop trying to make more money is if he drops dead from a heart attack.</p>
<p>Australia is a prosperous country, and deserves admiration for its success. But Australia has always had ambitions of being a global power, and not a third-rate nation in terms of global influence. They realize that they cannot have the global influence of America and China, and they seek the status of second tier nations such as Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia. But they cannot have that influence if they remain a relatively small nation of 22 million people. The elites in Australia want a nation of 35 million, and, later, 70 million.</p>
<p>Whites are just too fiercely competitive to be content with anything, even with a low-crime, near-paradise, such as Australia. When whites ruled the world, it wasn&rsquo;t enough - they wanted to conquer and dominate each other in Europe.</p>
<p>Think of what would happen in the world, if whites were increasing their population at the same rate as black Africans. They would wipe out all rival races. Perhaps the white demographic decline is Mother Nature&rsquo;s way of controlling a sub-species of humanity that has superior intelligence, from endangering other human species that lack the same intellectual abilities. Perhaps in the DNA code that enabled whites to put a man on the moon, there may exist a self-destruct mechanism, that exists to restore the balance in nature. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;we need more immigrants to support the elderly&#8221; is bogus for a number of reasons, some previously stated.  Another way to solve the population imbalance situation:</p>
<p>1) Divert resources from schools to nursing homes.  There seems to be a pattern among government officials that a budget must always go up.  Not true.  If the school age population goes down then obviously you put less into education and more towards the elderly.</p>
<p>2) Innovation.  Is there a way to do the same job with fewer people?  If you were to watch an early 20th century film of men laying railroad track and a film of men laying track today you would be astounded at how few men are needed today.  Why? Mechanization.  Importing cheap labor is a very 19th century economic model.  Why bring in unskilled people when many jobs could be automated.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons for the growth of the middle class in first world nations is that the amount of work that one man can do is much greater now than it was one hundred years ago.  How many men does it take to build a car now versus fifty years ago?  Before I was born my mother worked in the bookkeeping department of a large Philadelphia insurance company.  She worked in a huge room filled with woman, sitting at desks with adding machines, keeping books (I saw a photo, incredible).  Today that is all done by a computer run by some technicians and a few data entry clerks.  Even data entry clerks are going away thanks to handwriting recognition technology and bar code technology.</p>
<p>3) Many jobs, however, must still be filled by people.  Many unskilled jobs, by necessity, still exist.  Most countries have a NATIVE born pool of lower intelligence people who frequently end up on the government dole.  Why can&rsquo;t they perform those jobs?  Why do we need to import janitors and scrub women?  Or busboys?  Or lawn keepers?  We don&rsquo;t!  Young people in high school/college, welfare recipients, non-violent offenders and even the mildly retarded can all do those jobs.  There should be no welfare, that would force the able bodied to have to do the jobs &#8220;no one&#8221; want s to do.  As for the retarded, many are capable of handling simple jobs and would love to work and have a career, even if it was a wash and fold job in a hotel laundry.  And if we want to reduce recidivism jobs for convicts are an important necessity.  And can you explain to me why I have to buy stamps from a foreign born postal clerk?  You mean to tell me there are no Americans (or Australians, or Brits, or&hellip;..) who would be capable of working behind the counter of a post office?</p>
<p>4) In the US (and I would bet Australia as well) as huge number of government employees are foreign born.  Why?  There is always unemployment, so why should whites have to pay confiscatory taxes to pay people from foreign counties to do government jobs?  There should be a constitutional ban on any foreign born person (even if naturalized) from working for any local, state or federal agency or department.  If these people are so important to our economy, if they contribute so much more than they take in government services (as our leaders tell us) then there is no need for them to take civil service positions. None!  If we were to believe government propaganda on how important these people are as &ldquo;tax payers&rdquo; then letting these people take tax payer supported jobs is counter-productive since they came here to be tax contributors.</p>
<p>5) Finally, it is time Australia developed a nuclear deterrent.  The Aussies do not need enough atomic bombs to destroy the world, just enough so that any nation (such as China) that felt Australia was an easy target would pay a terrible price for an invasion, even if they ultimately won.  With a nuclear deterrent you don&rsquo;t need to be the biggest or baldest, just bad enough to make a war unprofitable.  Taiwan should do the same if they value independence.<br>

		<p>#26 Deepak, while whites might be less predisposed to groupishness than other races, there are plenty of cases where whites have formed tight groups. The mechanisms that enable whites to do this might also be different than from other races. Examples of white groups include Roman Catholics, Puritans, Nazism, occupational guilds, political parties, universities, companies, nationalities, and ethnic groups. If what you are saying is true (that whites are too individualistic) then why did it take massive fraud in intellectual movements to convince whites to ignore racial interests? Why has their been so much repression on whites from expressing their opinions or freely associating with fellow whites?</p>
<p>Extracting lessons from 1913 is perilous. I don&rsquo;t think whites at that time were worried in the least about non-white parts of the world competing with them. So there wasn&rsquo;t any strong incentive to form a white racial identity that transcended national identities. As for Australia, it should reconsider it&rsquo;s global power ambitions and settle for being an important part of the Western bloc of nations. Finally, I wouldn&rsquo;t impute any motives to Mother Nature; I don&rsquo;t think scientists would support such speculation.</p>

		<p>The heading should read, &#8216;Australians don&rsquo;t want anymore muslim or other third world migrants&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Australia has accepted over 7 million migrants since WW2 and also over 750,000 refugees. Most of these migrants and refugees prior to the mid 70&rsquo;s assimilated into Australian society but sine the Immigration Restrictions Act 1901 was repealed in the mid 70&rsquo;s there has only been disaster. </p>
<p>Now we over 80% of our migrant intake from the third world and the place is really starting to suffer. Over 35% of new migrants end up on the dole, rorting the taxpayer. The Fabian Labor Govt. is happy for these bludgers to come here as they are natural born Socialists and will support Labor through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Australians are against third world immigration and multiculturalism just like our Brothers and Sisters in other Western lands. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with British, Amercian or other white people coming here as they are similar in most ways and would find it easier to assimilate. The problem lies with the mix - too many third world rorters accepted while access is denied to productive would be migrants.</p>
<p>Aussies pls. go to www.protectionist.net.</p>
<p>Good on you John Bell. Appreciate the support. Here&rsquo;s to Nick Griffin and Geert Wilders kicking some left wing butt in the upcoming elections. At the end of the day, it is up to us - the citizens of the West to take matters into our own hands. Our left wing Govts. have destroyed so much, it is up to us to destroy them.<br>

<p>This could far more easily sum up Chinese and Indians, who go after every last cent and will step over bodies in the process. To me when the white man made billions the liberalism and loss of sense of self-preservation took over. Not too unlike how the 3rd generation of a rich family squanders the fortune, or how that saying goes. The hunger and the determination is just gone and everyone is invited in to pick at the remains.</p>
<p>As for Australia, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in the Australian psyche to want to be a world power. In the current Prime Minister&rsquo;s head, maybe, but the average Aussie is far too disinterested in such matters.</p>
