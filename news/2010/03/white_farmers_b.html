<h1><a href="https://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7078730.ece">White Farmers &#8216;Being Wiped Out&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan McDougall, Times of London, March 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE gunmen walked silently through the orchard. Skirting a row of burnt-out tyres, set ablaze months earlier to keep the budding fruit from freezing, they drew their old .38 revolvers.</p>
<p>Inside his farmhouse Pieter Cillier, 57, slept with his 14-year-old daughter Nikki at his side. His 12-year-old son JD was having a sleepover with two teenagers in an adjoining room.</p>
<p>As the intruders broke in, the farmer woke. He rushed to stop them, only to be shot twice in the chest.</p>
<p>In his death throes he would have seen his killers and then his children standing over him, screaming and crying.</p>
<p>The attackers, who were drug addicts, simply disappeared into the night. Cillier&rsquo;s murder, at Christmas, was barely reported in the local press. It was, after all, everyday news.</p>
<p>Death has stalked South Africa&rsquo;s white farmers for years. The number murdered since the end of apartheid in 1994 has passed 3,000.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Zimbabwe, a campaign of intimidation that began in 2000 has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, but has left fewer than two dozen dead.</p>
<p>The vulnerability felt by South Africa&rsquo;s 40,000 remaining white farmers intensified earlier this month when Julius Malema, head of the African National Congress&rsquo;s (ANC&rsquo;s) youth league, opened a public rally by singing Dubula Ibhunu, or Shoot the Boer, an apartheid-era anthem, that was banned by the high court last week.</p>
<p>Malema&rsquo;s timing could hardly have been worse. Last weekend in the remote farming community of Colenso, in KwaZulu-Natal, Nigel Ralfe, 71, a dairy farmer, and his wife Lynette, 64, were gunned down as they milked their cows. He was critically injured; she died.</p>
<p>That same day a 46-year-old Afrikaner was shot through his bedroom window as he slept at his farm near Potchefstroom. A few days later a 61-year-old was stabbed to death in his bed at a farm in Limpopo.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Dubula Ibhunu, defended by senior ANC officials as little more then a sentimental old struggle song, has been greeted with alarm by Tom Stokes, of the opposition Democratic Alliance. He said the ANC&rsquo;s continued association with the call to kill Boers could not be justified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any argument by the ANC that this song is merely a preservation of struggle literature rings hollow in the face of farming families who have lost wives, mothers and grandmothers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>He was supported by Anton Alberts of the right-wing Freedom Front Plus party: &#8220;Malema&rsquo;s comments are creating an atmosphere that is conducive to those who want to commit murder. He&rsquo;s an accessory to the wiping out of farmers in South Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rossouw Cillier, Pieter&rsquo;s brother, bristled as he pointed to the bullet holes in the panelled kitchen of the farmhouse near Ceres in the Western Cape. &#8220;They shot him through the fridge from the back door  &mdash;  the bullets came straight through here, into his heart. He never had a chance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A successful apple and pear grower, he believes his community is living on borrowed time: &#8220;More white farmers have been killed than British soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. Yes, we are at war here.&#8221;</p>
<p>His brother&rsquo;s farmhouse is now shuttered and empty. &#8220;I can&rsquo;t spend time here. We&rsquo;ll have to sell. This farm has been in our family for generations but it must go. Who&rsquo;ll manage it? The children will never come back here. They held their own father as he died in front of them. Will they ever get over that?&#8221;</p>
<p>As we walked across the orchard, fruit destined for the shelves of Tesco and Sainsbury&rsquo;s in the UK was still being picked. A tractor passed a 10ft cross erected in honour of the murdered farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It lights up at night,&#8221; Rossouw said. &#8220;My brother was a religious man. It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left of him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across South Africa many farmers feel endangered. In Northern Province a tribute has been created beneath an enormous sign with the stark Afrikaans word &#8220;plaasmoorde&#8221;  &mdash;  farm killings. Thousands of white wooden crosses have been planted across a mountainside, one for each fallen farmer.</p>
<p>Recently the government&rsquo;s department of rural development has been airing proposals to nationalise productive farmland as a &#8220;national asset&#8221;. Critics claim it is designed to deflect criticism from the ruling ANC&rsquo;s failures.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a lot easier talking about nationalising farms than building decent houses, making clean water come out of taps or honouring promises to redistribute farm plots to millions of landless poor,&#8221; said a spokesman for AgriSA, the farmers&rsquo; union.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Ceres there are few groceries in the township store  &mdash;  tins of pilchards, baked beans, some dried biscuits. A group of teenage boys sit on the burnt-out remains of a Ford Escort. This is where Cillier&rsquo;s killers gathered, in a shebeen, a drinking club, where they fortified themselves with cheap hooch before they set off to rob him. They escaped with nothing.</p>
<p>According to Rossouw Cillier the most telling detail is that his brother was unarmed when they attacked. &#8220;If we brandish a weapon, we&rsquo;ll go to prison, not them. What did they gain from this murder? It was an act as pointless as their lives.&#8221;<br>

		<p>All of the white farmers should leave South Africa and Zimbabwe; and Australia, Canada,the United States and maybe a few other countries should give them asylum based on the fact that they are a persecuted minority.They would make far better immigrants than what we typically get from Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p>Ahhh right and they know this how?  Where they ever apprehended?  Did the police even lift a finger trying to apprehend them?  I suppose whites must have sold them the drugs or at least invented them so this makes the murder a victimless crime according to the UK press.</p>

		<p>What amazes me is the fact that white people would actually consider living ANYWHERE in Africa!!  I mean, that is a black continent, and should be left to its own devices.  Whites who try to defy the facts are clearly going to end up dead.  I say let Africans handle their own affairs - and see how long it takes them to come running to whites to bail them out of their failed enterprises.</p>

		<p>The USA has an open borders policy with the Third World. It would be wise if our government was more picky with who it decides to let in. Personally, I think we should allow the persecuted, white farmers of South Africa to immigrate to the USA instead of countless Latino peasants.</p>

		<p>This country is rapidly sinking into the same situation.  Transfer of wealth to the richest and poorest.  Government run by people who mainly look out for themselves  Massive influx of Third World peoples.  No real jobs.  Massive debt and still spending.  The silent okay to kill whites by blacks and hispanics.  Blacks are a protected species.</p>

		<p>@ Peejay # 1 : Nice thought but no other first world country wants us, but we are in huge demand elsewhere in Africa. ( However, as soon as our farmers are successful the local population wants their land back - normally just before the harvest )</p>
<p>@ Anonymous # 3 : Yes, but in the USA the crimes are never nearly as brutal as in SA ( with apologies to the Christian/Newsom victims - that came close )</p>
<p>@ Tactless old pedo # 5 : And bailed out they will be !! Examples : New Jersey, Chicago, Gary Indiana, Haiti, and about 50 other African states. In fact, at this very moment the SA goverment is being bailed out on a daily basis by the powerful forces from outside SA that put this gov in power in the first place.</p>
<p>@ Anonymous # 6 : We appreciate the thought but your government (since long before the Obama regime) does not want us. It is virtually impossible for a white SA&rsquo;n to gain entry into the US without going through the process of immigration - taking years and costing thousands of Dollars).</p>
<p>@ Anonymous # 7 : You are correct. But now imagine being outnumbered about 12-1 - with the law protecting the black perp and the criminals being in parliament.</p>
<p>Note to fellow Amrenners : We SA white Christians beg of you to keep a keen eye on SA in the months between the Soccer World Cup and Christmas (i.e. July to December), as we are expecting a black uprising without precedent. And we expect no help from anyone (that much has been made clear in the past), but please pray for us - that&rsquo;s all we ask.</p>

		<p>Thank you so much for placing this article! Just like the genocide in Rwanda and the Holocaust the mainline media keeps quiet and awareness is restricted to a handful of people. I know of South Africans who are blissfully unaware of the rate of murders against white farmers because they do not read or hear it in the media. Farm murders are seen as robbery! As if robbery is ok! </p>
<p>Just this little bit of awareness is extremely important.<br>

		<p>The whites should just leave South Africa - en mass.</p>
<p>Then we would see how the Africans get on. It would be Zimbabwe writ large.</p>
<p>I would be so happy to see tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of white South Africans turning up at Heathrow Airport and demanding Asylum. How we would laugh as the Socialist Government of the UK squirmed.</p>
<p>Now they would be the kind of immigrant I have no problem with.</p>

		<p>At the High School where I teach, I&rsquo;ve often brought up the subject of the genocide in Southern Africa and am met with a blank stare and no verbal response.<br>
The situation in Sudan is the &#8220;darling&#8221; of our Social Studies Dept.  They have and annual Die for Darfur day in which the kids in the &#8220;Darfur Project&#8221;  spend the night lying on the floor of the Commons area as if they were dead; all for the purpose of raising consciousness about the emergency. When I question the staff if they are also teaching about the Muslim Arabs who are the perpetrators of the genocide, I get the same stare and again, no response.<br>
It&rsquo;s amazing how a group of people can go on pretending that they aren&rsquo;t aware of the truth.</p>

		<p>What I would ask is WHY White stayed in South Africa after Apartheid ended. I would have sold my property, destroyed or poisoned what I couldn&rsquo;t sell   &mdash;   and gotten the hell out. Given the obvious reality Blacks would turn out as they did.</p>
<p>Whites should form private militia units and visit justice on the local thug population.</p>
<p>Everything Apartheid stood for&hellip; was amply corroborated by conditions in post-Apartheid Africa. Why is the world afraid to admit the original South Africans had it right after all?</p>

		<p>Australia has more welcoming immigration policy to white South Africans than the United States from what I&rsquo;ve heard from friends. White South Africans, particularly those that are educated and under 40 should seriously consider heading down under.</p>

		<p>Just one thing to consider:  The white farmers in S.A. hired hundreds of thousands of black migrant workers over the last 100 years or more.  This brought more blacks into previously empty areas, leading to the false idea in the era of apartheid protests that the whites had invaded a land filled with blacks and pushed them off their farms.</p>
<p>The resulting higher nutrition allowed those blacks to become millions who wanted what whitey had.  Would those same farmers, if brought here, hire Mexican laborers?  Probably.</p>
<p>Our own farmers are doing this for the cheap labor, but it has become a time bomb that will overwhelm us very soon.</p>
<p>Just food for thought on the folly of looking to pay the cheapest wages.</p>

		<p>I would find this humorous if it weren&rsquo;t so tragic. Black Africa, or any black for that matter, just can&rsquo;t figure out they&rsquo;re biting the hand that feeds them. Even the smallest of children understand that you don&rsquo;t attack, much less kill, someone who is providing you with basic necessities of life. </p>
<p>Would black Africans have thought of burning tires to prevent produce from freezing? Would they have even realized that some of the produce can be used to keep growing food, or do they think White farms have fruit bearing plants that magically appear each year?</p>
<p>I understand that SA is founded by Whites and White Africans don&rsquo;t want to abandon their homeland, but when home wants to kill you, you get the hell out of Dodge and wait for all the black Africans to kill themselves, then head back and rebuild.</p>

<p>  I wish to God we would. Unfortunately, the United States doesn&rsquo;t consider whites to be a persecuted minority anywhere in the world. I also recall a BBC documentary on refugees in Great Britain from Zimbabwe  &mdash;  all were black.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the greatest and most pernicious misconception about SA is that the Afrikkaners displaced the black natives of the area.</p>
<p>What is now South Africa was in fact a virtually unpopulated area of the African continent when the first whites arrived in the early 19th Century.  It was only because they were drawn by the opportunities created by the white settlers that blacks migrated to the colony.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly one of the great tragedies of the 19th and 20th Centuries that the original white settlers in SA couldn&rsquo;t foresee the inevitable result of allowing hordes of job-seeking black Africans to crowd into their country.  Clearly, they were aware of the risk and created their apartheid system to preserve what they&rsquo;d created. Of course, it worked for a time, a long time in fact, but they should have been able to see by the dawn of the 20 Century that the nation they&rsquo;d created was doomed,  just as the USA ultimately may be doomed, or at best greatly diminished.</p>

		<p>#8 - I am not saying that the whites who died weren&rsquo;t good people.  Doubtless they were the salt of the earth - it&rsquo;s just that Africa is a BLACK continent, and any white person who thought it was somehow going to tolerate their presence forever was in a permanent daydream.  No - Africa is black, and I say let it STAY that way - whites need to see reason and get out of there.  Living in Africa is suicidal for white people.</p>

		<p>To White is Right #21:</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the lead article &#8220;When the River Ran Red&#8221;, AmRen &#8216;08, about the history of White settlement in SA:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;When the [settlers] arrived in the area now known as Cape Town, whites came into contact only with Hottentots and Bushmen. As the number of Europeans increased, they expanded east and north, only meeting their first black tribe, the Xhosa, some 500 miles away, on South Africa&rsquo;s east coast. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The Boer leader of the time, Piet Retief&hellip; identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the Zulu kingdom, which lay open to settlement&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>After battling and defeating neighboring Zulus, the boers made the fatal mistake of employing large numbers of fecund blacks as servants and workers when they should have worked the land themselves; in time, the number of blacks overwhelmed them:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;. Afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of European civilization, blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society. The Cape Colony and the original Boer republics, which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by Europeans, are today home to tens of millions of Africans&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>An interesting thing is to compare the number of victims of farm murders in the new South Africa with the number of people lynched in the USA during the segregation era. The latter amounted to about 5000 victims over a period of several decades (and a sizable number of those 5000 happened to be White, by the way). The point is, blacks have killed more Whites in new SA in a fraction of the time that segregation lasted in the USA, yet this is not seen as an atrocity. But then again, since White people seem to have lost their instinct for self-preservation, it really has become a non-issue. </p>
<p>One of the points I have made elsewhere is that  new SA  is a harbinger for the First World if (when) the Third World moves into it. Really, what else can we expect other than a race war? It&rsquo;s not that Whites want this race war, indeed the vast majority of White folk these days are bending over to be tolerant towards third worlders. The dilemma is that the third worlders see this thing as a racial struggle. And of course, they are egged on by the purveyors of multicultism, many of whom happen to be White and/or managerial elite types who are using third world migration as a means to undermine traditional Western institutions (see Sam Francis).</p>

<p>You are describing exactly what is causing the problem in the first place. When whites &#8220;bend over&#8221; to accommodate third worlders, whites get screwed.</p>
<p>You are not going to see a race war in China and Japan. Why? Because the citizens of those nations do not &#8220;bend over&#8221;, and allow foreigners to screw them.</p>
<p>If whites want to avoid a race war, then they need to stop &#8220;bending over&#8221;, and begin the process of sending third worlders home. If whites continue &#8220;bending over&#8221;, then they will have blood on their hands, because they failed to take the action necessary to avoid a race war in the future. The future generation of whites who will fight the race war, will blame the whites of today for doing nothing, and creating the conditions of the future that will ignite a race war. Your white descendants will spit on your graves. <br>
