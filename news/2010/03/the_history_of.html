<h1>&#8220;The History of White People&#8221;: What It Means to Be White</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Rogers, salon.com, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But as Nell Irvin Painter explains in &#8220;The History of White People,&#8221; her exhaustive and fascinating new look at the history of the idea of the white race, [race is] a social construct that goes back much further and is much more complicated than many people think. In the book, Painter, a professor of American history at Princeton, chronicles the evolution of the concept of whiteness from ancient Rome  &mdash;  where, she points out, the slaves were largely white  &mdash;  to the 21st century America and explains how, in the era of Obama, our once-narrow concept of whiteness has become at once far broader and less important than ever before.</p>
<p>The elevation of some ethnic groups  &mdash;  Germans and Scandinavians  &mdash;  as &#8220;whiter&#8221; than others can largely be tied to a small number of scientists who shared an obsession with both measuring people&rsquo;s skulls and pinpointing the world&rsquo;s &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; people. {snip}</p>
<p>Salon spoke to Painter over the phone, about the meaning of &#8220;Caucasian,&#8221; America&rsquo;s obsession with racial difference, and the real meaning of Stuff White People Like.</p>
<p><b>Why write a history of whiteness?</b></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spent so much time in this country on various racial issues. It&rsquo;s our national sport, in a way, and it&rsquo;s always as if there is only one side: nonwhite. But this is one of those binaries where you need both sides to make sense of it.</p>
<p>I want to point out that this book is not about white nationalism. It&rsquo;s not about how bad white people are. It&rsquo;s about how we have thought about people now considered white. I used to encounter reservations about the project, and people would ask, &#8220;Why are you doing this as a black person?&#8221; People hear it&rsquo;s a book called &#8220;The History of White People&#8221; and that it&rsquo;s by a black author, and make assumptions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Human Genome Project found that there&rsquo;s no genetic basis for racial difference. Is this the end of race?</b></p>
<p>This is nothing new. {snip}</p>
<p>But just as there&rsquo;s been the discovery that race is a concept with no scientific meaning, there&rsquo;s also been a cultural movement to rerace knowledge. When the genome was completed in 2000, the headlines were, &#8220;Race is meaningless,&#8221; &#8220;We&rsquo;re all the same,&#8221; and then three to four years later there came, &#8220;I am a race-profiling doctor.&#8221; There was heart medicine marketed to black people. What&rsquo;s really interesting about finding race in the genome in terms of diseases is that diseases that have been discovered so far with a strong genomic cause are among white people, not black people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>As you write in the book, there were four great expansions of what America considers whiteness. What were they?</b></p>
<p>The first three are expansions of whiteness, because the assumption was that to be American you first had to be white. The first occurred in the Jacksonian era, in the first half of the 19th century, when citizenship criteria were changed from wealth to race. That&rsquo;s when adult males of any income were allowed to vote, as long as they were considered white. Things changed in the 20th century, when different groups came in as immigrants and people of Irish background were incorporated into the notion of American whiteness. The third great enlargement took place in the mid-20th century, starting with the New Deal in the 1930s and WWII. Politics and the mobilization of Americans to fight the Great Depression and to fight the Second World War opened up American-ness to people who had been considered alien races and their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re currently in the midst of the fourth great expansion, which is an expansion of the idea of the American  &mdash;  that an American doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be white to be considered American. &#8220;American&#8221; now includes Hispanics, for example, and people who identify themselves as multiracial. Because of this sort of great enlargement, we can no longer sum up the American as one person or the white man as one person.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conspicuous that many of the scientists who were trying to determine the &#8220;most superior&#8221; white race were obsessed with figuring out which race was best-looking.</p>
<p>Physical beauty and race were thought to be something physical and permanent that can be passed down generation to generation, but if you look at magazines from the 1960s or the 1920s, you see that ideas of beauty change. What I find so fascinating is that if you look carefully at the faces of many models today, they would not have passed as beautiful in the middle of the 20th century. Now we look more at bodies. We like bodies to be very thin  &mdash;  like thinness is beauty.</p>
<p>Every few years there also seems to be a new fashionable ethnicity for runway models  &mdash;  one year it&rsquo;ll be Russians, the next it&rsquo;s Brazilians.</p>

I must have missed that announcement.  Or that the genome has been completely mapped and decoded, and that we know what every single gene does(we don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>If race is meaningless, how is it possible that genetic testing can be done on dna to determine the race of a subject?</p>

<p>The Human Genome Project is nothing buy politically correct so-called &#8220;science&#8221;.  There most certainly are races, but the more the powers that be promote miscegenation the more diluted the White gene pool becomes.  At some point in time if this continues - along with the low White birth rate - there will be no more discernible White Race, and the politically correct hucksters will then REALLY be correct.  This is what they&rsquo;re hoping for, a time when there will be no more White race, when Blacks and other races have appropriated our genes and used our own genes against us to destroy us.</p>
<p>Wake up America, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and everywhere else where there&rsquo;s White people.</p>

		<p>Silly stuff put out by those who want all people to blend together.</p>
<p>The full column gives the usual nonsense about humans being 99.99% the same.  This is silly, but just for a moment pretend it&rsquo;s true.  Humans have approximately 3 billion letters making up their genome. That&rsquo;s a lot of room for many differences.  Also, at the DNA end of things, as much as one letter being changed makes a world of difference at the full organism end.</p>
<p>Want a computer example?  Try typing a website address and just be off by one letter. Big difference.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As it turns out, we all share 99.99 percent of the same genetic code   &mdash;   no matter our race&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>By some accounts, that may be true. By the same reasoning, we also share more than 98% of our genetic code with the Chimpanzee. It is often said that, were a chimpanzee to randomly type on a typewriter, and given enough time, he would eventually type out the Encyclopedia Britannica. That may or may not be true, but even were it, who has enough time to wait until it is published? </p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t often find it all so neatly and concisely packaged thus, but this simply HAS to be the biggest pile of unmitigated manure posing as a scholarly work ever compiled! Aside from being a scientific nightmare, this is just so much leftist opinion dressed up as an academic exercise - which is to say, it ought to be welcomed with open arms by the media, academia, the government, etc. </p>
<p>To think the day has come, where Whites stand by and allow a bigoted black woman define who and what we supposedly are. The depths of our modern cowardice is as terrifying as it is pathetic!   </p>

		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re currently in the midst of the fourth great expansion, which is an expansion of the idea of the American &mdash; that an American doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be white to be considered American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is only one American Race, Comrade Painter!</p>
<p>It is, and only can be the white race; we are an annex of Europe and we embody that; anyone who says otherwise, is a Communist fool!</p>
<p>I do not care, for a second, what &ldquo;surprisingly was wrong&rdquo; with the black &ldquo;American experience,&rdquo; or why the oozing &ldquo;Latino enrichment,&rdquo; are a pauper&rsquo;s grave parade for this country! </p>
<p>They are, what they are!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rainbow&rdquo; Pink Communism and outright Red Marxism are the only &ldquo;cogent thoughts&rdquo; that nonwhites can conceptualize for this country, simply because it is in their interests. How and why, labor and capital would be &ldquo;equalized&rdquo; are such &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; concepts for them, in this clearly socially constructed crimson milieu of derangement, is beyond me; it seems, that only parasitical &ldquo;equalizers&rdquo; are ever even mentioned in conjunction with, the anti-white  theoretical &ldquo;accepted chic&rdquo; of the day. </p>
<p>How unexpected?</p>
<p>What do any of you really anticipate here? The nonwhites and their maudlin white traitor masters will eventually admit to being in opposition to this?</p>
<p>Hardly!!!</p>
<p>Just reach into your pockets, and get your Obama &ldquo;Health&rdquo; Care Card!</p>

		<p>Anonymous #1 is right.  Race can be determined from a DNA sample, as every forensic scientist knows, but strangely, the Human Genome Project is supposed to have determined that race doesn&rsquo;t exist.  The liberals are the modern creationists in their rejection of biological science.</p>
<p>All &#8220;Whiteness studies&#8221; and &#8220;Whiteness science&#8221; that is done by the left these days is obvious and virulent anti-white hatred.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s so much idiocy in this piece that it&rsquo;s impossible to even scratch the surface of it. Fortunately, American Renaissance has blown all of these claims to bits over the years. I can&rsquo;t think of anything (although some would say God) other than race that so clearly exists but that so many people are desperate to deny the existence of. And if the concept of race is a &#8220;social construct,&#8221; then why is it the most universally accepted &#8220;social construct&#8221; in history and why are they having so much trouble disabusing the ignorant masses of such a belief? I would add that when it comes to choosing where to live, the &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; crowd have no more trouble than the rest of us in choosing a neighborhood that is &#8220;socially constructed&#8221;  to keep the riffraff out.</p>

		<p>Ugggghh why do people like this even exist, much less have a forum for their views.</p>
<p>Of course a black college professor writes a book about race - it&rsquo;s all they know how to do.  No, it&rsquo;s not our &#8220;national sport&#8221;, lady, the rest of us actually are, you know, getting real things done.</p>
<p>Of course a black person would write a book like this.  Sounds like its a nice little hate letter to white people.  I notice Painter&rsquo;s snide little nastiness about how white people are the ones with genetic problems, &#8220;not black people&#8221; (one of the many lies she utters in this interview - sickle cell anemia, greater rates of prostate cancer, that new cardiovascular thing they just discovered - all more genetically prevalent in people of African origin).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the Human Genome Project ever announcing anything like &#8220;race is scientifically non-existent&#8221;.  If they did, it was probably PR designed to placate the Nell Irvin Painters of the world, who stand ever ready to cause trouble against scientific findings that make them feel bad about themselves.</p>
<p>Of course the (relatively rare) smart black people (college professors, et al) want there to be no criteria for membership in the white race.  They feel that they deserve to be let into the club.</p>

		<p> Yet another multi-culti trying to deny the obvious, insisting in the face of all evidence to the contrary that there is &#8220;no such thing as race,&#8221; talking about the findings of the Human Genome Project as if they were Holy Writ. Isn&rsquo;t it just barely possible that the Human Genome Project sachems found just what they wanted to find   &mdash;   that their &#8220;research&#8221; was hardly unbiased, and larded with pre-conceptions of which they were determined to find &#8220;proof&#8221;?</p>
<p> And if what constitutes &#8220;beauty&#8221; is just a fad that changes every few years, who do Indians and other Asians consistently find lighter-skinned people more attractive? Why do black men so often try to gain access to the beds of White women   &mdash;   instead of their OWN women? No matter how much learned drivel this author spouts, we ARE the beautiful race, and the one that has accomplished the most in this world. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother Asians over much, but it drives blacks and self-hating Whites absolutely CRAZY! </p>

		<p>Ian is correct. The Human Genome Project never showed that there was no difference between the races. It was elements of the Bolshevik media, the red-diaper grandkids who made these statements, who twisted facts. </p>

		<p>Joseph Campbell the myth guy would tell you that race is not strictly physical in nature. Is cultural too. The European or white race possesses the oldest culture in the world, about 50,000 years old. Some say the Australian aborigine is older, but of course they would. But a &#8220;racial&#8221; cultural continuity in Europe does go back about 50,000 years?</p>
<p>And of course the genome DOES NOT tell us that we are all the same. The disease MS is due to a gene [?] misfunctioning, an alteration of the genome that occurs in tens of millions of whites ONLY, and is originally found in a single person living in Europe over 50,000 years ago? AND THIS IS JUST A SINGLE INSTANCE, YOU COULD FIND OTHERS AS WELL OF WHERE RACE MATTERS!!</p>
<p>20 % [WHITE] of the worlds population are lactose tolerant.<br>
2 % [WHITE] of the Caucasian population have a natural immunity to the bubonic plague [Black Death] and AIDS, the rest of the worlds people do not.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>This particular person of color, writing about WHITE folks, is doing some from a political perspective, and not truly from a racial and cultural perspective?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;I am a race-profiling doctor.&rsquo; There was heart medicine marketed to black people.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do recall this doc saying &#8220;WHOA&#8221; to the entire concept that there is no such thing as race. TO DO A PROPER DIAGNOSIS OF A PATIENT, RACE MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. MANY DISEASES ARE SPECIFIC OR FOUND MORE OFTEN IN CERTAIN RACES. And is not only concerning the way that medicines work either. Much more than that! </p>

If culture is meaningless, then why do those disposed of their heritage, feel the need to be reconnected to their culture?<br>
After all isn&rsquo;t culture just information after all?</p>
<p>The Liberal idea is that with race, sameness is the rule, but with culture, sharing differences is the ideal.</p>
<p>Discounting race as a factor in the making of the culture, only opens the risk of having the (our) culture destroyed by race, by denying its existence.<br>
It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make chickens, but we&rsquo;re going to do away with eggs.&rdquo;<br>
We can all see that our Western culture is losing its form in order to become &ldquo;one size fits all,&rdquo; no doubt the new comers don&rsquo;t fit in because the culture/society was made for us.</p>
<p>But then all this &lsquo;diversity and cultural enrichment&rsquo; talk is really just a diversion really, a justification, rationalisation or a smokescreen. <br>
We all know that what is happening is wrong, but instead of lamenting the damage that the ants are doing to the henhouse, we need to look at what motivates those who fight on behalf of the ants. <br>
Of course we can&rsquo;t negotiate with those who are agents for destruction, profits or for their own power gaining, self interests. <br>
But to those who do sincerely believe that things are changing for the better, they and we know that we do have the right to preserve and conserve our own piece of true diversity, damn it. <br>
The meaning of life is &#8220;don&rsquo;t die&#8221; and our genes are how we get to live forever.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The Human Genome Project found that there&rsquo;s no genetic basis for racial difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>No it didn&rsquo;t. Blacks who know what the HGP is are concerned about what it may reveal about race differences, and intelligence in particular.</p>
<p>Furthermore, percentages alone tell us virtually nothing about the genetic code. Gene &#8220;switches&#8221;, which are insignificant statistically, can control other gene groups resulting in huge differences between individuals.</p>

		<p>Simple question: If &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; is relatively so inconsequential and meaningless&hellip; WHY do so many Blacks, Black females in particular, try to &#8220;whiten&#8221; themselves, change their typical inherited appearance to look White?</p>

		<p>Come to think of it&hellip; could it be Nell Painter is so bothered by historic reality&hellip; That WHITES made today&rsquo;s civilization possible. With White scientists, researchers, thinkers slowly accumulating that mass of knowledge our civilization rests on. The incredible wealth of knowledge and learning making our technological and medical achievements possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is only &#8220;guesswork&#8221; on my part&hellip; but I am unaware the invention of the working steam engine did NOT happen in an obscure Asian village or in Black populated Africa. While Asians had rudimentary medical knowledge for centuries, I am unaware of acupuncture being the ideal cancer treatment. Nor am I aware of any incredible technological breakthroughs in the sciences&hellip; made in Sub-Saharan Africa before 1900 A.D. (or even after that date&hellip; by Black Africans).</p>

		<p>Even if different racial groups amongst humans are 99.99% similar, it&rsquo;s that last little bit of difference which has the most meaning.  Anyone who denies such either does not understand how evolution works, or denies it outright.</p>
<p>Evolution works by differences, not so much among individuals as such, but amongst populations within a species.  A new and clever mutation would most likely  be swamped out (or possibly never passed on, due to sexual selection) in a large, free-breeding population.  Isolate a smaller part of that population from the main body, however, that mutation has more of a chance to spread.  And if it&rsquo;s beneficial, it may come to define that population, as a different race/strain/breed or even subspecies. as more individuals come to carry that new gene or gene combo.</p>
<p>Therefore yes, there may well have been only one population of hominids (or at least, one that can be counted as our ancestors), but as early humans spread, various populations became isolated from other populations, breeding only amongst themselves, and thus generating racial differences.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s so scary for the Left is that physiological differences can also reflect genetic-based behavioural differences, which may also impact, not so much intelligence, per se, but in HOW different races/strains/breed/subspecies think.  And there&rsquo;s the crux of the matter.  While it&rsquo;s permissible to say that wolves and dogs (the latter now thought to be a subspecies of wolf) certainly _think_ somewhat differently, even though basic behaviour patterns remain the same (sociability, obedience to authority), heaven help them if it should be shown that yes, whites think differently from African blacks who think differently than Orientals, who think differently from Arabs, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think culture itself may well be a marker of this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Race is meaningless&#8221; &#8220;We&rsquo;re all the same&#8221;&hellip; In some ways we are all the same&hellip;We&rsquo;re all made of atoms, we need water&hellip; but even identical twins are not perfectly identical.                 Variation is what makes the world go round. Sameness is stillness. Life is motion, change, difference. Would classical music, philosophy or Christianity have been born in black Africa? Is Eastern philosophy the same as Western? Justice and beauty are concepts all peoples have utilized but the specifics of what constitutes these have varied greatly. (Competition) in ideas and on the battlefield have been the main carving tools that have shaped humanity. Whether we like it or not, the biosphere is a free market place of ideas.. the bad ideas and their adherents go extinct..the good ideas are rewarded by surviving. To conclude this post, I think that a variety of models of genetic meaning or meaninglessness should be allowed to be adhered to by those so inclined. A free market of ideas should tolerate different perspectives to follow out their destiny. If race and gender are truly illusion then those groups that maintain otherwise will go extinct.. etc. But there is no justice in quotas or affirmative action if all are born inherently equal. Thus let people group and hire and fire and sell their houses to.. whoever they want and let nature take its course. &#8220;Nature never said one thing and wisdom something different&#8221; Juvenal</p>

		<p>Race is partly skin color, physical attributes. But race is also culture, mentality, reasoning and thinking ability. Assuming the rabid claim by liberals, there are NO differences between races&hellip; why didn&rsquo;t all racial groups develop and progress equally over the last 50,000 years? Why have White Europeans and their descendants have had to be the major contributors to human progress?</p>
<p>Why have African Blacks not produced their own Marie Curie, researcher and co-discover of radiation and X-rays. A William Gilbert, a Michael Faraday (researching electricity and furthering our understanding of it.) A Black Galileo, a Black Isaac Newton, a Black Johannes Kepler   &mdash;   astronomers and physicists furthering our understanding of astronomy, gravity, planetary motions.</p>
<p>Oh, never mind. I understand now Whites stole credit from those Africans. Guess Painter has it right after all [NOT]!</p>

		<p>Who is this babbling, lip-bibbling idiot Thomas Rogers? I can&rsquo;t remember ever reading a more incoherent piece outside of an SDS pamphlet back in the Sixties.</p>
<p>And this curious notion that race is a &#8220;social construct?&#8221;  Hmm, if that&rsquo;s the case the mating of two East Asians could result in the birth of a Caucasian or black African I suppose.</p>
<p>Low intelligence and the propensity for criminality by black Africans is yet another social construct.  And lack of any written language, lack of any technological achievement, lack of anything beyond tribal social development in sub-Sahara Africa must be another socially constructed illusion.</p>
<p>All races are different, just as all breeds of dogs are different.  The one thing we all have in common is the ability to interbreed.    </p>

		<p>#4 Ronald: That chimp Would be frustrated and quit before he got halfway through the a&rsquo;s, considering he hadn&rsquo;t already chewed up the keyboard. Great post of absurdity. Although it is obvious to these geniuses that there are no significant genetic differences between the races. I myself can hardly tell them apart. They all look, sound and act, so much alike it is all very confusing to me, but then anyone who actually believes this probably qualifies to be a college professor.</p>

		<p>This is the book I commented on last week on another comment heading.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was published because I often don&rsquo;t look to see if my submissions are published or not.  But I reported that it was a story on NPR Monday or Tuesday last week.  This author means whites harm, make no mistake.  Consider the arrogance and audacity of her as a black &#8220;scholar&#8221; writing the history of white people.  Can anyone imagine the outcry is a white man wrote the history of the black race today?</p>
<p>With the recent trend in history book writing so rife with revision, how could she imagine that she would be taken seriously in the long run?</p>
<p>And of course the claim that there is no genetic basis for identifying race is completely false.  She relies on repeated political platitudes, and uses examples of faulty 19th century racial ideas on whiteness to make her point.  The fact is that it is very possible to genetically predict the race of anyone due to a number of genetic characteristics beyond simply the amount of melanin likely to be produced.  Other posters have supplied links to just a few of the studies that have confirmed this over and over in the past decade. By her line of logic, we cannot differentiate fish, but only identify them as fish.  This would stand for any other species. </p>
<p>Her book is an attempt to deconstruct the white race as something that could be unified while upholding the racial pride of her own and other racial/ethnic groups.  A good example is her rationalization above concerning concepts of beauty.  Nonsense.  Every racial group has favored its own lighter skinned members and continually sought to mate up towards lighter skinned offspring.  Today&rsquo;s worldwide obsession with the White European female &#8220;concept&#8221; of beauty is only an expansion of a historical constant.  Her use of the modeling world or even beauty pageants is bogus because they have become so political, or as in fashion simply a change decided upon by a few eccentric designers.  People vote with their money.  Women in Asia spend gobs of money to look more white and so do African American women. </p>
<p>It may be possible to hear her interview by going to the NPR website and locating the file.  I think that the program may have been &#8220;Fresh Air.&#8221;  If I can find it I will post a link to it on another post.</p>

It was also predominately a White English Speaking  Christian  based culture.<br>
If that is all so bad why does everyone want to immigrate there for a better life.<br>

		<p>To poster #29, the book Guns, Germs and Steel has the answer:  It says because Europeans had horses, steel and more resitance to disease.  That enabled whites to conquer the world.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, Africans had all those things and did little.  The Central Asians struck out a few times but their civilizations collapsed.  Asians had those things, but they stagnated inward.  Arabs had those things and stagnated after a while as well.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s our turn to stagnate!</p>
