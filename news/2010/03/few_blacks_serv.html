<h1><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/16/nation/la-na-black-diplomats17-2010mar17">Few Blacks Serve in Top U.S. Diplomatic Posts</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Richter and Tom Hamburger, Los Angeles Times, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The State Department has fallen short in its efforts to promote African Americans to key frontline diplomatic posts, department officials and diplomats said, despite efforts to increase diversity under two black secretaries of State and a black president.</p>
<p>The State Department has high numbers of black employees overall, and some prominent African Americans in top positions, such as Susan E. Rice, ambassador to the United Nations. But officials said few minorities were climbing to senior frontline posts that wrestle day to day with some of the nation&rsquo;s most urgent international challenges in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Only one U.S. embassy in Europe is led by a black ambassador, for example.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Department data from September  &mdash;  the most recent available  &mdash;  show that of the 32 diplomats then heading embassies and other U.S. missions in Europe, only one, John L. Withers, the ambassador to Albania, was black. However, Withers says he will leave that post later this year.</p>
<p>There were no African Americans among the 10 ambassadors or other chiefs of mission in South and Central Asia, or the 18 in the Near East, and only one among the 17 in East Asia.</p>
<p>However, 11 of the 37 missions in Africa were headed by African Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, African Americans make up about 16.3% of the State Department&rsquo;s employees, compared with about 12.8% of the U.S. population. But of Foreign Service officers serving overseas, 6.9% are black.</p>
<p>Latinos, Asians and Native Americans are also under-represented compared with their share of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>The shortfall of black diplomats in top embassy jobs has long troubled African American diplomats.</p>

		<p>African Americans are overrepresented at 16 out of 17 Government departments, by as much as 600% at one of them. When will there be a push to right this wrong?</p>

		<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s spent time in Washington DC knows that the bulk of clerical workers in all government agencies, employees at GS-7 and below, are black. I&rsquo;ve long thought that to be a reasonable explanation for why the federal government is so notoriously error-prone and inefficient.</p>
<p>Blacks are WAY overrepresented in almost all government agencies, but most of them &#8220;work&#8221; at the lowest levels. As the saying goes, those who think the dead never come back to life should see a government office at closing time!</p>

		<p>Well if anyone at the LA Times had 2 brain cells to rub together they&rsquo;d know that sending a black man to an Asian nation as the chief representative would be seen as quite insulting.  They&rsquo;re not as squeamish with their feelings about the blacks as we are.  </p>
<p>Someone at State understands this, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s only one black ambassador among all the missions to that continent.  Not everyone out there is as anxious to accept the coloreds as our lovable Marxist race crusaders.  </p>
<p>Maybe they should send the bossman from the Detroit School Board to an Asian country.  Do you think they have any Chinese-Ebonics interpreters in Beijing?  Hell WE can&rsquo;t even understand these people half the time, can you imagine the culture shock of sending one of our affirmative action products to dialogue with the big shots in other countries?  Does anyone out there actually see Vladimir Putin accepting one of these people as an equal player?</p>
<p>LET&rsquo;S GET REAL!</p>

<p>Well, this is not fair. Too many blacks in positions within the State Dept. They should have ONLY their fair share of such positions. Hillary needs to adopt an action plan to correct this discrepancy.</p>
<p>And of course there are not enough blacks in ambassadorships to European countries. Of course it is so. Could anyone think less. Show the face of America as it is, not just whitey in those key positions. Always the diversity triumphs. Those European positions normally are given to big campaign donors to the President, who ever is in office at the time.</p>

		<p>Blacks are overrepresented at state?  Hel-lo!</p>
<p>Blacks are overrepresented at all levels in the feddle gummint, the largest single affirmative action employer in the world.</p>
<p>And people wonder why the federal government of this country is, overall, perhaps the most ineffectual, incompetent, and corrupt major organization on the planet.  I exclude, of course, the governments of all black African nations, since these cannot be considered governments in any real sense.</p>

		<p>Great comments!!<br>
generalquagmyer: In private, most people in D.C. will admit that the African-American secretaries in D.C. are a major problem  &mdash;   lazy, obstructive, displaying initiative only when gaming the system to forward their own interests. But everyone pretends not to notice. The old formula holds true here: race blindness + race differences = hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>The reason that we send Blacks to Africa as ambassadors is that Africa is the only place where an affirmative action diplomat is as smart as the locals.  </p>

		<p>Could it be that so few are qualified?  If they want the position, I&rsquo;m sure there are a host of black nations who will want them.</p>

		<p>30+ years ago, when I first started working for HEW (Now HHS), I was surprised to hear Blacks refer to HEW as a &#8220;Black department&#8221;.  In their eyes, we Whites were there to do the work that they were incapable or unwilling to do, but that was it.  My last supervisor, before I retired, was a Black woman who managed to put together a White team, and let us do our work.  She was the best supdervisor, Black or White, that I had in the government.</p>

		<p>Out of 100 Americans, 70 are white and 12 are black. Of those 50 whites and 12 blacks finish high school. Of those only 30 whites and 2 blacks finish college. Since educations is supposed to be the prime requisite for employment, statistically speaking only one in 15 blacks is representative of equal opportunity. In other words 6.9% black is dead on.</p>

		<p>Here is my experience with the hiring practices of the Department of State.</p>
<p>I have been trying to get a passport for an upcoming cruise. As I was born in the Panama Canal Zone of a military father, I had to apply to the State Department for a copy of my birth certificate, which was, according to them, the only documentation I would need to receive a passport. Just this week I received a letter from the State Department notifying me that the copy of my birth certificate was &#8220;insufficient evidence&#8221; of my citizenship; that I would need to supply them with a copy of one of my parents&rsquo; birth certificates. Why didn&rsquo;t they inform me of that when I sent off all my information?? </p>
<p><br>
At the time, I didn&rsquo;t realize that as a child you are entitled to a copy of your parents&rsquo; birth certificates. But I was not the only one unaware. So was the EEOC hire, Saquita, at the State Department who answered the phone when I called about it.</p>
<p>A condensed version of the conversation is as follows: I asked Saquita what I had to do to get a copy of a parent&rsquo;s birth certificate or what else I could use, since my father was deceased and my mother is elderly and lives across the country.</p>
<p>Saquita: Well, you could AXE for a copy of yo father&rsquo;s death certificate. Oh, but wait, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t give you a copy of it since you&rsquo;re not him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: But, SAQUITA, he&rsquo;s DEAD. He CAN&rsquo;T request it - remember? He&rsquo;s DEAD. He doesn&rsquo;t need it anymore.</p>
<p>Saquita: Well, you could AXE yo&rsquo; mama for a copy of her birth certficate.</p>
<p>Me: I&rsquo;m sorry, I could what?</p>
<p>Saquita: You could AXE yo mother for a copy of her birth certificate.</p>
<p>Me: I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand, I could WHAT?</p>
<p>Saquita: (extremely huffy by now, speaking very slowly) YOU COULD AXE YO MOTHER FOR A COPY OF HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE THAT SHE COULD MAIL TO YOU.</p>
<p>ME: OH, ASK!! You&rsquo;re meaning ASK! I&rsquo;m sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why I would take an axe to my mother. But no, my mother isn&rsquo;t capable of getting a copy, I&rsquo;m trying to ASK how I can get it!!!</p>
<p>Ooh, she was livid now, but so was I. It went on like this for about five minutes, and then I suggested that she report this call to her superior and let him listen to the recording &#8216;for quality purposes&rsquo;. I sarcastically told her thanks for no help and it would benefit others if she would actually LEARN what was supposed to be her job. (She was supposed to have known that I had a right to request a parent&rsquo;s birth certificate.)</p>
<p>I hung up, found the number for Kansas State Vital Statistics, the phone was answered by a white woman, extremely thorough, polite and absolutely helpful, who said cheerfully, &#8220;Oh, certainly ma&rsquo;m, as a dependent you are entitled to copies of your parents&rsquo; birth certificates. I will be glad to help you with that. In less than 5 minutes I have a copy of the needed document on the way.</p>

		<p>Of the black adults in this country with a four year college degree and mastery of standard English, what are the stats of moderate fluency in other languages compared to white Americans? </p>
<p>It is hard to rise in the Diplomatic Corps without competency in at least one language other than English and that is as it should be; disparate impact notwithstanding.</p>
