<h1>The Perils of Multiculturalism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Pasquarelli, Australian Conservative, March 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What&rsquo;s happening on our streets today is the product of decades of multiculturalism, stupidly subscribed to by all sides of politics. The guilt-wracked Malcolm Fraser gave us the first boat people when Vietnamese fleeing their Communist vanquishers sought refuge in Australia and other countries. </p>
<p>In 1976 Fraser gave us the double whammy when he allowed Lebanese Muslim refugees into Australia against all the advice of his Immigration Department. Since these times the rates of migration to Australia has steadily increased as well as the refugee intake. </p>
<p>In 1997 the Howard Government signed off on African refugees without any regard for the cultural incompatibility of many of these people and alarming evidence of lax health and character checks started emerging  &mdash;  notably the interviews by Alan Jones with Amanda Vanstone and Tony Abbott over a particular intake of Sudanese.</p>
<p>Ethnic ghettos where English is only spoken when it has to be, are now firmly established in our cities and major provincial centres and the resulting tensions and violent conflict provide daily media coverage  &mdash;  carefully controlled by politically correct governments, police forces and compliant journalists. TV and newspaper footage has people&rsquo;s faces pixellated, ethnicity is rarely mentioned and juvenile and even some older offenders are not allowed to be named for all the usual civil libertarian reasons.</p>
<p>Since the attacks on Indian students, particularly in Victoria, politicians and commentators are sitting on their high horses delivering homilies on racism  &mdash;  some of them having a vested interest due to their personal and political relationships. </p>
<p>Core Australians of Anglo-European, Christian-Judeo origin also have their vested interests by virtue of their place in Australian history. Those who can legitimately claim to be shareholders in the ownership of their nation are those whose ancestors served in laying down its pastoral, industrial and cultural foundations and most importantly, those who served and sacrificed in times of conflict. Included in this group are of course Aboriginal Australians, who I shouldn&rsquo;t have to mention separately, but will, because of the destructive policy of separatism which has unfortunately created such division. The remaining shareholders are those of other racial groups who have totally assimilated and whose allegiance is solely to that of Australia.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism with its illogical slogan of &#8220;unity through diversity&#8221; has spawned ethnic crime in Australia and this deadly virus is running amok. The NSW Police has its Middle Eastern and Asian crime squads, whereas in Victoria the use of the word &#8216;gangs&rsquo; and any form of ethnic badging are outlawed by the politically correct police media unit. </p>
<p>Victoria&rsquo;s Police Commissioner Simon Overland refuses to use the words &#8216;zero tolerance&rsquo; when being interviewed on talkback radio and he has recently advised Indian students to &#8216;dress poor&rsquo; to avoid being attacked; and he joined the Gay Pride march in St Kilda, being photographed with homosexuals dressed as Catholic nuns, begging the question  &mdash;  would he have been willingly photographed with homosexuals dressed in burkas?</p>
<p>Overland has seriously lost the plot which has huge political and police morale implications.</p>
<p>My grandfather Luigi, who came to the Queensland canefields from Northern Italy before WW1, told my father that &#8220;the Mafia came with me&#8221;. So ethnic crime has been around for a while. But multiculturalism has ensured that we have a huge spread of criminals  &mdash;  Russian, Sudanese, Middle Eastern, Cambodian, Pacific Islander, Serbian, Croatian, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Ethiopian  &mdash;  the list goes on and is a veritable global roll call.</p>
<p>Whites assaulting Indians may satisfy the standard definition of &#8220;racism&#8221;, but what about Africans attacking whites, Asians attacking whites, Pacific Islanders attacking whites, Middle Easterns attacking whites and, yes, Indians attacking whites, and so on? Then we have Africans attacking Indians, Asians attacking Indians, Middle Easterns attacking Indians and all the other variants. </p>
<p>Ted Baillieu, a totally committed multiculturalist, has blundered into the racial debate in Victoria, obviously trying to pin all the blame on whites with his comments on violence against Indians; and whilst this makes the Greens and the café latte set happy, it could backfire electorally with the mainstream.</p>
<p>As well as fostering ethnic crime, multiculturalism has created the sordid struggle for the ethnic vote, with Labor winning hands down, as demonstrated by Paul Keating&rsquo;s brazen saving of Sheik Hilali from deportation  &mdash;  testimony to the electoral success of Middle Eastern branch stacking in the western suburbs of Sydney. We have seen the steady increase of Asian voters in Bennelong; and the ALP is laying down the foundation for future wins in suburban electorates nationwide. </p>
<p>Australians have never been consulted by either side of politics about the nationally crucial issues of immigration, refugees and citizenship requirements, whereas real estate developers face mountains of red tape and have to provide acceptable environmental impact statements before they get the green light. On the other hand, migrants and refugees are literally dumped willy-nilly into lower socio-economic suburbs and provincial centres without any consideration whatsoever of the impact on the social and economic elements  &mdash;  no ghettos in Double Bay or Toorak, Mr Baillieu!</p>
<p>Tony Abbott has been talking about referendums for this and for that, but let&rsquo;s see more action and less vaudeville. He has had suggested to him that dedicated email and postal addresses be established to allow Australians to record their views on multiculturalism, boat people, immigration, refugees, ethnic crime and citizenship right up to the election. This is not rocket science so let&rsquo;s see some action.<br/>

		<p>They could easily be talking about Canada.  </p>
<p>Modern Canadian mass immigration began with Vietnamese, then the Lebanese, then the Somalians.  These so-called refugees now take regular trips home or sponsor their relatives to join them.  <br/>
 <br/>
From Brisbane to Berlin, there is a rumbling of discontent across the family of white Western nations. The media is waking up late to it. </p>

		<p>Unrestricted, or even limited, non-assimilation type immigration over time, is a proven destroyer of Nations.  We have seen this lesson play out multiple times throughout history, yet we persist in believing that this time it will turn out different.  It will not.  The graves of our societies will be the mute testimony to our continued idiocy.</p>

		<p>australia, canada, european nations, and the u.s.a. all have free elections. they voted in and continued to vote in the very politicians that ruined their respective countries. this didn&rsquo;t happen overnight, these politicians served for years in office, and spouted this garbage, and were never voted out of office. the problem is that white folks took their way of life for granted. they were too consumed with their sports, their big screen t.v.s and comfortable couches, and their movies. their own apathy has ruined their countries. they have no one to blame but themselves.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no use lying about the cause: Australians <i>were</i> consulted - as were Americans, Brits, Canadians, and you name it. It&rsquo;s just that they refused to listen, or blindly judged opponents of immigration as racists rather than realists, or voted for leftists because they gave them more handouts paid for by future generations yet born.</p>

		<p>The author&rsquo;s mention of PM Malcolm Fraser interested me. So I looked him up on Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;He supported the Commonwealth in campaigning to abolish apartheid in South Africa&hellip;Fraser opposed white minority rule in Rhodesia. During the 1979 Commonwealth Conference, Fraser, together with his Nigerian counterpart, convinced newly-elected British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to withhold recognition of the internal settlement Zimbabwe Rhodesia government (Thatcher had earlier promised to recognise it)&hellip;Subsequently, the Lancaster House talks were held and Robert Mugabe was elected leader of an independent Zimbabwe at the inaugural 1980 election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Led to the elction of Mugabe - a brilliant leader he has been!</p>
<p>&#8220;A former deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated that Fraser was &#8216;the principal architect&rsquo; in the installation of Robert Mugabe&hellip;Under his government, Australia also recognised Indonesia&rsquo;s annexation of East Timor, although <b>many East Timorese refugees were granted asylum in Australia</b>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supported Indonesian annexation of East Timor, then recognized East Timorese as refugees&hellip;.from what, his own policy?</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraser also surprised his critics in immigration policy. According to 1977 cabinet documents, the Fraser government adopted a formal policy for &#8220;a humanitarian commitment to admit refugees for resettlement&#8221;.[10] Fraser expanded immigration from Asian countries and allowed more refugees to enter Australia&hellip;Fraser supported multiculturalism and established a government-funded multilingual radio and television network.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fraser deserves a special place in hell. He was defeated in the 1983 election, then in 1986 he was on a visit to Memphis when he was caught in a seedy hotel in a, uhm, compromising position. Caught, literally, with his pants down.</p>

		<p>Multiculturalism and the end of the White Australia Policy was just part of a programme that can be traced back to Lyndon Johnson, who brought in an Immigration Reform Act in 1965. Australia was more easily coerced than other western countries because we were allies of the US in Vietnam. Australia might not have opened its borders except for the Vietnam War. Gough Whitlam was opposed to Indochinese boat people, calling them Vietnamese Balts. </p>
<p>Since then, the Western world has been hoodwinked by half-baked arguments about demography and low birth rates, as even the third world waves of unskilled migrants will willingly pay taxes for pensions for aged Europeans. It&rsquo;s very rare to see these people, visible ethnic minorities, doing any volunteer work or work community services. </p>
<p>But it probably is not possible to reverse immigration trends without support from the larger governments of Europe and North America. The same laws and policies are enforced in all wealthy countries, as if there is a collective will to self-destruct. This may be the year, 2010, when the number of children born to minorities in the US is greater than those born to Americans of European heritage. </p>
<p>Luckily though, saner voices are becoming louder.</p>

		<p>One has to at least entertain the idea that this is a global conspiracy that is now coming to fruition.  And as we have called it here in America, The New World Order, is behind the rot of most Western nations.  For the life of me I can&rsquo;t understand what will be gained by it.  As an old Greek once told me, &#8220;Dogs don&rsquo;t do their BMs in their own backyards&#8221;.  I mean, the end of our age will destroy these elitists along with the rest of us.  Unless, the conspiracy includes the deaths of most of the Western population along with the immigrants.  Sounds fantastical?  Google the Georgia Guidestones.  One of the massive stones contains ten guides.  Guide one:  Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.  Strange isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Unity Through Diversity&#8221; Really?  I was in a Sydney suburb today which has a large diverse population as well as a special school for high intensity English Language tuition. I was one of the very few whites at the train station and I observed:</p>
<p>All the Asian kids stuck together<br/>
All the Afro kids stuck together<br/>
All the Middle Eastern kids also stuck together.</p>
<p>So much for all the lies about one world, multiculturilism, the universal nation, togetherness etc that the social engineers throw at us. Diversity yes, but all in there own little groups.</p>

		<p>Every word of this is true. In Australia we (European-derived Australians) have a political, academic and media elite that fervently hate us and the nation we and our ancestors have created. They will never be happy until white Australia is finally consigned to the history books, and the nation resembles something like Brazil or South Africa.    </p>

		<p>In the U.S., at least, few politicians have been willing to offer voters an anti-immigration choice.  And since we have to essentially deal with only two parties, it&rsquo;s been a frustrating fight.  Now we have the emergence of the Tea Party movement, largely in response to the deafness of our leaders.  There are loud rumblings in Europe and throughout the Commonwealth as well, so the matter is coming to a head.  <br/>
Many cultural liberals, throughout the world, thought that diversity was desirable.  Now that it&rsquo;s obvious that it&rsquo;s a nation destroyer, pols in republics must change their attitudes or be voted out.</p>

<p>It makes a huge difference what color they are and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.  It&rsquo;s because every race sees the world differently.  They may sometimes speak the same language as part of assimilating, but race is the underlying characteristic that is a constant.  As such, there will always be tension as long as multiple groups occupy the same living space.</p>
<p>Suppose we get rid of the so-called &#8216;racists&rsquo;, rednecks, etc.  Would the race problem be solved?  Hardly.  Somewhere down the line, a person is denied a promotion legitimately based on their incompetence or poor past job performance.  If the person making the decision is a different race, the tension returns with a vengeance because this is just one more variable thrown into the equation that would otherwise be absent in a non-diverse situation.</p>
<p>Homogeneous societies are hardly perfect, but are the only workable solution for this problem.  Every race needs to live separately and function based on their own abilities.  This is what most white nationalists including myself want.  We&rsquo;re tired of being told who we have to work, socialize, and live with.</p>
