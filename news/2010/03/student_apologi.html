			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gordon, Los Angeles Times, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The UC San Diego student reportedly responsible for hanging a noose last week in a campus library issued a public, but anonymous, apology Monday and said she had no racist motivation.</p>
<p>The noose&rsquo;s discovery set off protests at a school that is already tense from recent racially charged episodes and triggered condemnations from UC leaders and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>In a letter published Monday on the front page of the UC San Diego student newspaper, the Guardian, the student wrote {snip} &#8220;As a minority student who sympathizes with the students that have been affected by the recent issues on campus, I am distraught to know that I have unintentionally added to their pain,&#8221; {snip}. She was suspended Friday and remains under investigation for a possible hate crime.</p>
<p>The letter is signed &#8220;Anonymous UCSD Student&#8221; and offers no clues about her identity or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Sari Thayer, the Guardian&rsquo;s Web editor, said in an interview that the woman had asked the paper to publish the letter and that &#8220;a reliable source&#8221; confirmed its authenticity.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Student Activism, March 1, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Guardian, UCSD&rsquo;s student newspaper, has printed a statement that it says was written by the student who hung a noose in the campus library last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The student says that she didn&rsquo;t learn of the noose&rsquo;s discovery until Friday morning. &#8220;Ashamed and embarrassed,&#8221; she called campus police and confessed. &#8220;As a minority student who sympathizes with the students that have been affected by recent issues on campus,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;I am distraught to know that I have unintentionally added to their pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>An editor&rsquo;s note at the end of her statement says that the paper &#8220;has verified the author&rsquo;s authenticity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full text of the statement, which at this writing is only available in PDF form at the paper&rsquo;s website, appears below.<blockquote>I have a story that needs to be heard. I am the girl you&rsquo;ve read about, the one who hung the noose in Geisel Library.</p>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;m writing to apologize. I don&rsquo;t have an excuse for what I did, and I deeply regret it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m writing to hopefully put a little bit of faith back into the UCSD campus by clarifying that it was not an act of racism. This is what happened.</p>
<p>I found a small piece of rope on the ground earlier in the day. While I was hanging out with my friends a bit later, we tried jump- roping with it and making it into a lasso. My friend then took the rope and tied it into a noose. I innocently marveled at his ability to tie a noose, without thinking of any of its connotations or the current racial climate at UCSD. I left soon after with one of my friends for Geisel to study, still carrying the rope. After a bit of studying I picked up the rope to play with, and ended up hanging it by my desk. It was a mindless act and stupid mistake. When I got up to leave, a couple hours later, I simply forgot about it. This was Tuesday night. Three days later, on Friday morning, I found out that the noose had been found and construed as another racist act on campus. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed, and the first thing I did was call the campus police and confess. I was hoping to clarify that this was not an act of racism before the incident got a full reaction from the campus. I gave my statement around 9 a.m. They thanked me for coming forward and for trying to clear up the issue. Later, I received a campuswide e-mail saying that I confessed and had been taken into custody, which simply wasn&rsquo;t true. One thing that is true is that I have been suspended. I know what I did was offensive  &mdash;  regardless of my intentions  &mdash;  I am just trying to say I&rsquo;m sorry. <b>As a minority student</b> who sympathizes with the students that have been affected by the recent issues on campus, I am distraught to know that I have unintentionally added to their pain. [Emphasis added.]<br>

		<p>But she likely did have a racist motivation: against whites.  It was designed to create hysteria and ill-will toward whites.  It is whites who are guilty until proven innocent.</p>
<p>It was a hoax and the title of the article would be more accurate to say she apologized for the hoax.  She should be apolgizing to whites because they were the ones that get the blame until proven innocent.</p>

		<p>Wonder what the punishment would have been for a <i>White</i> student who tied one of those Forbidden Knots.  Certainly not anonymity and a form apology.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;without thinking of any of its connotations or the current racial climate at UCSD,&#8221;</i> she says.  What racial climate would that be? And who has created it?  Are we even allowed to ask?</p>
<p>Apparently even the sight of one of our precious Minorities getting caught in her co-racialists&rsquo; own trap isn&rsquo;t enough start anyone asking any embarrassing questions about this stalinesque atmosphere of paranoia and fear.  Maybe that would lead to one of those &#8220;dialogues on race&#8221; that our post-racial attorney-general says we&rsquo;re too afraid to have.<br>

		<p>Some things in this don&rsquo;t make sense or if they are true, display some weird behavior in the part of the college.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stipulate that her version of events are completely true.  That she immediately went to campus police to clear things up without being coerced to do so in any way.  Then why on earth are they suspending her?</p>
<p>But other things bother me.  When did a noose automatically become a symbol of racial animosity?  Like no one besides blacks has ever been hanged.  In the wild-west many horse thieves and the like would be hanged without trial.  Nazis were hanged, some states still have laws making hanging a method of execution, Saddam Hussein was hanged.  Throughout the world the more rowdy of political demonstrators hang effigies of political opponents.  Who decided a noose has ispo facto racial connotations?  </p>
<p>Further, one thing really bothers me more than anything.  If this noose-hanger had been a white male, what would have happened?  Would a suspension been enough to satiate the PC ethnic grievance  types baying for blood?  And don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m exaggerating.  Those la crosse players at Duke university almost had their lives ruined because of a bizarre witch hunt by these PC types. UCSD needs to step back and think about who is REALLY creating racial animosity of its campus.  Hint; it&rsquo;s not a bunch of white males.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe her. My suspicion is that she was trying to inflame tensions with a false hate crime. It is likely that someone saw her enter the building with the noose, and the pressue prompted her apology. These people truly hate us. </p>

		<p>She is lying.  &ldquo;I innocently marveled at his ability to tie a noose&rdquo;.  Every single black in America knows about the potency of the noose.</p>
<p>She and her friend made the noose, and hung it in the hopes that UC San Diego officials, Gov. Schwarzenegger, and the entire national MSM forces would start bashing white people.  But she discovered that she would be caught and so fabricated this story.</p>
<p>White people simply do not hang nooses.  They don&rsquo;t have the time and just want to stay away from blacks.<br>

		<p>It sounds like this story was made up to quell the racial tensions on campus.  </p>
<p>An anonymous minority student who accidently leaves a noose that just happens to set off some students on campus and they don&rsquo;t reveal who she is right away.  Then they assure us all that she has been taken into custody and suspended from the university. (The apology letter disputes the part about being taken into custody.)</p>
<p>Also, if the authorities believe the alleged student&rsquo;s story, they are wrong to suspend her.</p>
<p>This girl is either non-existant, trying to make Whites appear more racist or a total air head who got in due to Affirmative Action. (La, la, la, la.  I&rsquo;m just going to hang a noose on my study desk to spiff it up a bit and oh look at the time I&rsquo;ve got to get going.)</p>
<p>By all means UCSD, tell us just who it is that you first assumed to be a White racist!</p>

		<p>Amusing to see a non-White groveling a bit, especially this &#8220;&hellip;minority student who sympathizes with&hellip;&#8221; whining Blacks.  <br>
     This is clearly a case of someone seeking non-White skin privilege, a coward trying to use her race to dodge a well-deserved bullet.  No White would be let off with such an excuse, so I&rsquo;m not inclined to let anyone else off either.  The only White skin privilege I can see is having the sense to know your inalienable rights and the dignity to exercise them.  Non-Whites who don&rsquo;t know or care about the Constitution can hardly be expected to make a principled appeal for freedom of speech.  To them, and their White Marxist allies, it&rsquo;s all about the power to hurt your enemies, and right now, this girl fears the power of the Blacks.  You go, girl.  </p>

		<p>Honestly it sounds like a plausible story.  Maybe it&rsquo;s just well written to deceive but the fact that it does not involve a white person and the person was suspended anyway, lends credibility to the story.</p>
<p>The worst part of the story is the media now has siezed this opportunity to further demonize a hunk of rope, even though they apparently already had a confession on file.</p>

Ever thought of how racist a pair of Keds can be? White canvas white rubber soles..and then there at the top set of eyelets..a mini noose. How many poor black sharecroppers at UCSD live in mortal terror of Klansman flaunting the secret signs of White Power.

		<p>3 Roger: &#8220;When did a noose automatically become a symbol of racial animosity?&#8221;<br>
     Probably around the time that the word &#8220;yellow&#8221; became a racial slur instead of a color.  A few days ago, driving with a couple young people as passengers, I was critiquing the driver ahead of me.  The girl said to me, &#8221; &#8216;Monkey&rsquo; is a racially derogatory term.&#8221;  I pointed out to her that I could not see the driver ahead of me and therefore could not have known if they were Black or not.  I then pointed out that in many cultures, the monkey is synonymous with foolishness, regardless of race.  I refrained from calling her a monkey.  <br>
     These new meanings for ordinary words and symbols are booby traps placed by our Enemies to force us into their habits of speech and thought.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m dubious about at least 50% of this story. But even so, it&rsquo;s worth noting that incidents of this type are VERY OFTEN found to be created by the very people who claim to be aggrieved, looking for sympathy or to cause trouble for others. And so it was here.</p>
<p>Also, why is she apologizing to other &#8220;minority students&#8221; for &#8220;adding to their pain&#8221;?  What pain?  That&rsquo;s ridiculous. The blunt fact is that it is whites who always come under suspicion as the culprits in so-called &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;,  so therefore it is the white students to whom she should be apologizing.  Her sham &#8220;apology&#8221; is worthless.</p>

		<p>Every time this happens, the individual should be charged with <i>two</i> counts of hate crime  &mdash;   one against the purported victim class, and one against the class defamed.  In this case, the former being blacks and the latter whites.  Indeed, whites and  <i>men</i>  &mdash;   there&rsquo;s a third count.</p>
<p>Minorities will quickly account for a majority of hate-crime instigations, if they don&rsquo;t already.</p>

		<p>I suspect she was caught via security camera tapes.  I doubt she turned he self in willingly as stated. Since she was a minority, the powers that be allowed the story to be concocted as above along with an apology to downplay the situation as much as possible.  </p>
<p>If he perpetrator had been white, you would have seen completely different actions taking place, along with criminal prosecution for a federal hate crime. The main stream media would have been circling the story likes sharks in the water and the race baiters such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton fanning the flames of white racial hatred.</p>

		<p>Apparently, most of these assumed hate actions are stunts by minority groups to gain attention and sympathy.  Such behavior has been going on for decades now, and the mainstream media is afraid to ignore it, for fear of being labeled racially insensitive.  Recently, in addition to this noose incident, there have been swastikas and anti-gay graffiti at UC Davis, cotton bolls at U of Missouri, and scrawled death threats in Canton, OH. These either sound like middle-school pranks or racially motivated hoaxes carried out by individuals of the same developmental level.  Wolf has now been cried so many times that no one should take a single such incident seriously.</p>

Moose &hellip;&hellip;NOOSE</p>
<p>same thing, <br>
Can a white person be convicted for carrying a sign with a MOOSE on it?</p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake, lets find out.</p>

		<p>Elementry my dear Watson, one  does not require the services of Sherlock Holmes, to unravel the mystery of the hanging noose. She did it to stir hatred for whites, whom she assumed would get credit for the incident, alas, on being discovered, she had to cover he back side, with a ridiculous tale. Firstly, and sadly, it is a federal offense to even make an actual noose. Secondly since no mention was made of her race, or her name, it was obvious she was black. The P.C. police gave this a snow job, however, the black showed through the snow.</p>

		<p>Roger &amp; Walter are right. White students, especially guys don&rsquo;t have the time because they did not receive AA scholarships. Most of them are slinging hash or tending bar in order to pay for classes in hopes that eventually they will make enough money to live where they don&rsquo;t have to look at blacks much less deal with them. These AA students who constantly believe it necessary to create some incindiary act need to get a life, by maybe using the time to learn to read.</p>

		<p>Update on Hate: Somebody fashioned a pointed hood out of a pillowcase and put it on a statue of Dr Seuss at UCSD.  Police are investigating.<br>
     &hellip;clackclackclackclack&hellip;<br>
     At the University of California&rsquo;s Santa Cruz campus, a drawing of a noose has been discovered in a toilet stall.  Police are investigating. <br>
     &hellip;clackclackclackclack&hellip;<br>
     At UCLA, &#8220;Asian&#8221; students are demonstrating against &#8220;racism&#8221;.<br>
     I believe that I&rsquo;ve read that UCLA is majority Oriental.  What&rsquo;s their beef?  I&rsquo;m thinking that they figure that they can piggyback on any &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; measures and gather more privileges for themselves.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find that the noose girl at UCSD is an Oriental too.  <br>
     BTW, I&rsquo;m not making these news items up, they&rsquo;re straight off the Yahoo!</p>
<p>FYI to the younger posters: in the olden days, radio newscasts always had recordings of printing presses playing in the background, clackclackclack&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about their student statistics, but I&rsquo;ve ridden through UC campus @ San Diego in the bus various times.  I saw ONLY Oriental students there.  Surely white male gentiles are a very small minority.</p>

		<p>I still hear whining complaints about Lynching, most recently from Tavis Smiley and Cornel West in their I Am America exhibit,  which is race bating propaganda about &#8220;unpaid labor from enslaved africans&#8221;. They emphasize the the number 3400 lynchings.  I stand  ashamed of my self for not asking &#8220;How many white girls have been raped by afrothugs since lynching was outlawed.&#8221; If it is more than 3400 blacks, then you owe us more lynchings.</p>
<p>The afrothugs who raped our white women owe us an unpayable debt of thanks for our not having lynched them. </p>

		<p>People today automatically assume blacks getting lynched by whites and with nooses was always for &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;hateful&rsquo; intentions.  These black men did nasty and cruel things.  They committed rape and murder.  Obviously, that is grounds for execution.  I highly doubt that most whites even back then, who had to spend every minute working, farming, and taking care of themselves and their family, had time to go out and constantly harrass blacks and kill them and beat them up for no reason.  That just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not about to defend slavery, but in many ways it was no worse (or even better) than the truly terrible conditions that existed for industrial workers in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Slavery was simply a different economic arrangement for those who were considered childlike and unable to look after themselves (and many of whose descendents still can&rsquo;t, to be frank).  In lieu of being paid wages, they got free food, free clothing, free housing, free medical care, and were required (by law) to be cared for when old and no longer able to work.  How lucky! All they had to do, in return for their keep, was follow instructions and work.  They also had free time for themselves, their own houses and garden plots, and could even earn money of their own on the side. </p>
<p>Yes, some whiner may say they only had a log cabin. Well, so what?  That was standard for the time.  Many Americans, even presidents, were born and raised in log cabins.</p>
<p>By contrast to the slaves, how many immigrants received ANYTHING for free?  Was a wretched, crowded, unheated tenement in the slums any better than a log cabin?  Many coming from a peasant background, they not only had to contend with learning a new language and unfamiliar customs, but were paid a pittance for their labor. They went to work in the mines and factories and sweatshops and railroads at a minimal wage that barely kept body and soul together, and they were in constant debt to the company store. If they didn&rsquo;t work, they weren&rsquo;t paid. When they got sick or old, they were on their own. There was no welfare, social security, or pensions. Their only support in sickness or age was their children.  Compare that to the guaranteed care of the blacks who didn&rsquo;t have to worry about such things. Yes, slaves had no liberty to leave the plantation, but in exchange for that they had free lifetime care and no worries. Poor whites were strictly on their own. For them, it was sink or swim. Aside from the churches, there was no help. And charity, then, was considered a private thing, not a proper concern of the government.  </p>
<p>Yes, slaves had to work for their keep (how awful!&hellip;  how mean and cruel!)   &mdash;  - but so did EVERYBODY, except for the very few people who were very rich. (And, btw, there were rich blacks to owned slaves too.)</p>
<p>Would you rather be working out in the fields, picking cotton in the healthy sunshine and fresh air; or working in a blazing hot, dangerous steel mill; or down in a dark, damp, dangerous coal mine where you were contracting lung diseases that would shorten your life if a cave-in didn&rsquo;t kill you first?  Or building and working on the early railroads, which were very dangerous.  Again, the blacks were lucky.  Slaves were too valuable to be sent into jobs like this.  But white workers were expendable, as they didn&rsquo;t cost anything to an &#8220;owner&#8221;  and could easily be replaced.</p>
<p>So, who had it worse?  </p>
<p>As for lynching, whites got lynched too&hellip; a fact that&rsquo;s conveniently glossed over by all the black apologists, as if lynching was a black thing. It wasn&rsquo;t! In frontier communities and backwater places without courthouses and established justice systems, it was local justice.  Furthermore, nobody was lynched just randomly, or for Saturday night fun, as you might think from the way they describe it today. If someone was lynched, he had to have done something to cause it.  It was for a reason. (The reasons, in such exhibits today, are NEVER mentioned.)</p>

<p>Someboby here brought up a good point. The two whites youths in Jenna, La. were given prison sentences for driving around with a noose hanging from the back of their pickup. And in the Jenna case the blacks involved in beating up a white student who had done nothing to them were either sentenced to probation or let off. What they did to this white kid was an obvious hate crime. So it will be interesting to see what happens at Un Calif. at S.D. I bet this girl of minority status will be at most given a &#8220;slap on the wrist&#8221; And what will Gov. Arnold demand? Will he demand that she be given a prison sentence, or at least be kicked out of school and made to attend sensitivity classes. Or will Gov. Arnold be a &#8220;girlie man,yah&#8221;.</p>
