			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press release, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>WARSAW, STRASBOURG, VIENNA, 19 March 2010  &mdash;  In a joint statement ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the OSCE&rsquo;s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) strongly condemn manifestations of racism and xenophobia, with a particular focus on the Internet:</p>
<p>&#8220;We must remain vigilant in the face of racist behaviour and incidents, including hate crimes and malicious expressions of hate and racist sentiments on the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our organizations are alarmed by patterns and manifestations of racism such as the ever-increasing use of the Internet by racist groups for recruitment, radicalisation, command and control, as well as for the intimidation and harassment of opponents. The Internet has become an important communications channel that links people in &#8216;cyberspace&rsquo;, who then meet and take action in the physical world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social networking sites are now prime locations for the spread of racist and xenophobic views, especially among young people. We must challenge such views, while being careful not to undermine freedom of expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger emanating from hate spread through the Internet has long been recognized by the international community and our organizations dedicate serious attention to this issue. Prominent examples include ECRI&rsquo;s General Policy Recommendation N° 6 on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Antisemitic Material via the Internet and the upcoming 22 March ODIHR expert meeting on challenges of combating crimes motivated by hate on the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, we strongly believe in the Internet&rsquo;s huge potential to overcome bias and prejudices based on characteristics including race, colour, language, nationality or national origin or religion. This potential should be fully utilized.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, the signatories of this statement, believe that:</p>
<p>- governments should investigate and prosecute criminal threats of violence based on racial, ethnic, religious or other bias and fully use existing domestic and international legal instruments and co-operation channels in this regard;</p>
<p>- governments should provide training to law enforcement officers and prosecutors on addressing hate crimes motivated by racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or other related bias on the Internet;</p>
<p>- governments should reflect on whether national legislation provides an adequate basis to respond to crimes motivated by racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or other related bias on the Internet;</p>
<p>- governments should establish or expand educational programmes for children and young people about expressions motivated by racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or other related bias they may encounter on the Internet and include media literacy training in school curricula;</p>
<p>- effective measures addressing hate on the Internet that do not endanger freedom of speech and expression should be identified and disseminated;</p>
<p>- civil society should explore ways of utilizing the popularity of social networking sites to combat racism;</p>
<p>- civil society&rsquo;s efforts to monitor the Internet for manifestations of hate, and efforts to share and publicise the findings should be encouraged and supported;</p>
<p>- the Internet industry should take an active role in addressing the issue of hate on the Internet and develop and implement effective complaints response mechanisms while respecting freedom of expression.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a mouthful.  Now, if they could just get everyone in the world besides just whites to know about it. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet has become an important communications channel that links people in &lsquo;cyberspace&rsquo;, who then meet and take action in the physical world.&#8221;</p>
<p>They and other thought control organizations and individuals are the only ones I know of that uses the internet to organize and then meet and execute their agendas.  A non-violent organization like Amren isn&rsquo;t even allowed to meet.  </p>
<p>What they haven&rsquo;t realized is that THEY are the new fascists/communist totalitarians who are asserting forced extinction on their own peoples through programs like theirs.  They hope to do this largely by legislating thought.  People like me hardly care what this issue is, if someone is trying to manage my thinking, or herd me psychologically, I will rebel against that organization of idea.  This is why I am not a Christian, or belong to any political party.  I just want to live where I want to and be left alone to associate or not with whom I choose.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t understand how even personal freedom doesn&rsquo;t matter to these bueaucrats.</p>

		<p>International Day&hellip; for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&hellip; I remember reading this Sci Fi short story as a kid, set in Africa. The characters kept referring to a major event that happened in the past, noting that &#8216;some people were proud of it&rsquo;. It was something bad, and it was ambiguous as to who it was exactly that was victim of the cataclysm. At the end of the story you realize all the white people on Earth had been killed. I really wonder, if these people get their wish if they would celebrate.</p>

		<p>I read recently that Muslims in Europe are disproportionately the victims of violent crime, therefore anti-Muslim racism MUST! be rampant.</p>
<p>Except for one detail:  The perpetrators are almost always Muslims too.</p>
<p>Europeans (otherwise known as white people) should go on the offensive by aggressively mounting legal claims against Muslims and other immigrant groups for homophobia, racism, sexism, etc. etc..</p>
<p>if pursued aggressively enough, this strategy would turn the tables on the invaders.</p>
<p>Never has a wholesale invasion of an entire continent been executed, and in such comfort - with the invaded offering housing, health care, food, education the the invaders, and prosecuting its own citizenry for any sentiments expressed against them.</p>
<p>Europe has turned into an open air insane asylum, and does indeed seem bent on race suicide, but there are solutions if people come to their senses:</p>
<p>Demand uncompromisingly that the invaders obey the law, work for a living, send their children to school, and conform to Europe&rsquo;s bewildering array of laws on sexism, racism, homophobia etc.</p>
<p>Many will flee to their home countries, uttering curses, and wailing piteously:<br>
nobody told us invading Europe was going to be so much work.</p>

Hoo-hee, now THAT&rsquo;S funny! I first read those words about 10 minutes ago and I&rsquo;m STILL chuckling over them! </p>
<p>Some of the content of the article is knee-slapping hilarious too: &#8220;civil society should explore ways of utilizing the popularity of social networking sites to combat racism&#8221;? LOL! And &#8220;civil society&rsquo;s efforts to monitor the Internet for manifestations of hate, and efforts to share and publicise the findings should be encouraged and supported&#8221;? Stop it dude, you&rsquo;re making my sides ache! Who writes your material, it&rsquo;s killer stuff!</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll probably stop laughing when the Internet censorship these clowns are proposing actually goes into effect and sites like this one start disappearing. </p>

		<p>I really wish people would wake up and quit believing that the bureaucrats and elites &#8220;don&rsquo;t realize&#8221; what they are doing, or that they don&rsquo;t understand they are oppressing freedom and common sense.  They full understand what they&rsquo;re doing.  It&rsquo;s intentional.  They assume we are too stupid to understand what they are doing to us.  And we must be, if we continue to think what they do they do without understanding or intent as to the consequences and end game.  They know.</p>

		<p>Nice timing:  There was a rally today by the EDL (English Defense League) in the city of Lancashire, and a bunch of &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; who go by the name UAF (United Against Fascism) came to disrupt the rally.  Now, the media are presenting it as a &#8220;fight,&#8221; but translated into English, this means the far left came to be disruptive.  </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ycvwsx3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ycvwsx3</a></p>
<p>As usual, the UAF types hurled insults, including accusations of Nazi-ism.  But look at the Mail&rsquo;s photos of the EDF&rsquo;s side (and how serene their side is compared to the UAF, who the Mail just has to show first.)  Notice that there are flags other than the Union Jack and St. George&rsquo;s Cross being flown in the EDF&rsquo;s side.  You can kinda make out one American flag, but you can obviously see a blue and white flag of a certain non-Islamic country in the Middle East.  Kinda of an odd thing for &#8220;Nazi&#8221; English (presumably Gentile) crowd to do.</p>

		<p>Anyone who still takes the EU organization and its affiliates seriously must be completely of his rocker. If the Lisbon treaty gets pushed through, an event that is not unlikely after the Irish abandoned their previously strong anti-EU stance, national sovereignty of the member states will be completely ceded to an organization that is run by socialist maniacs dreaming of the extirpation of the evil white natives and selfish business elites that are overeager to swap the white population for supposedly more malleable Muslim citizens, or other Third-Worlders. </p>
<p>Like many of you I firmly believe that our leaders are completely aware of what they are doing, but why? I&rsquo;ve been pondering for quite a while over their true motivations and it all boils down to one single plausible scenario (unless you assume that most American and European politicians, including vast parts of the white population, are just naturally dumb)</p>
<p>Diversifying a society to the utmost is a surefire way of destroying national cohesion, culture etc. and replace it with the golden calf of consumerism. A society where infighting and group interests prevail and not even a smallest common denominator of general consent among the population can be found is the best guarantee for an eternal power retention of a despotic upper echelon comprising socialist ideologues and industrial oligarchs. Socialism and predator capitalism are only contradictory concepts at a fleeting glance, both movements have already joined forces. You don`t believe me? How many times have you been told that a democratic system automatically begets a free market economy and vice versa? Just look at China, a nation that will probably ascend to the rank of the sole World Power after the downfall of our Western multi-ethnic nations. Capitalism and an authoritarian Stalinist system coexisting in perfect harmony. The only difference between China and the West is that Chinese people are traditionally subservient and cherish a natural respect for authorities, conversely Westerners are free-thinkers and rebellious. So the Euracrats, like the American government for instance are intent upon implementing a multi-tier sedation system in order to nip White unruliness in the bud and preempt potential insurgencies that might well jeopardize their interests. It is easy to keep everyday Joe`s behavior in check by providing him with enough distractions like sporting events (e.g. NFL, NBA etc.) and a bunch of celebs with stunning looks he can project his personal dreams on (Hollywood). But there will always be enough people who fall through the meshes, mostly the pseudo-intellectual types (e.g. college kids). Simply devise a plan that is centered around inculcating an ideology into their heads that plays on their emotions and exploits their gullibility (white guilt, cultural marxism etc.). Those people are currently used as facilitating prop-ups for the latest ploy of our rulers, the aforementioned diversification of society for the likewise aforementioned reasons. Socialists just like capitalists simply act on the same instincts as the rest of mankind, the craving for power and influence. The key-figures of the socialist movement have never been truly interested in changing society for the better, they were merely disturbed by the fact that they were not the helmsmen who steered its course. A situation that is now remedied by the collaboration with the capitalists, either consciously or subconsciously. Is their any perceptible difference between, lets say Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush, Donald Trump and George Soros in terms of goals, attitudes and worldviews?</p>
<p>I know it reads like a garbled conspiracy theory but is there any other logical explanation for the behavior of our ruling classes?</p>

		<p>There is a lot of doubletalk in this article. They repeatedly speak of combating &#8220;hate&#8221; on the internet, and then they talk about maintaining &#8220;freedom of expression&#8221;!     Well, which is it?  </p>
<p>Is freedom of expression to be reserved only for those they agree with, for those whom they like?  For those whose speech is insipid and harmless? For those whose speech offends no one? But it is only speech which someone finds offensive and upsetting that needs protecting! </p>
<p>They also continually advocate  addressing &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; and &#8220;bias&#8221;, but without defining what those &#8220;crimes&#8221; are. Do they mean merely thought crimes, speech crimes, opinion crimes?  Or actual physical violence where people are threatened or hurt?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an utter novelty, a phenomenon never seen before in the history of the world. And if it weren&rsquo;t happening under our very eyes, it would be too absurd and farfetched  even to be believable. </p>
<p>Can a supposedly intelligent species truly act like this?  Certainly, no HEALTHY or sane species would be collaborating in its own extinction.  That indicates to us that there is some kind of terrible malady or internal infection at work which has, in a sense, suppressed its &#8220;immune&#8221; system, its ability to reason clearly, to organize,  and to defend itself against outside attack.  </p>
<p>In short, Mother Europa is a very sick patient! And so are we.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not solely under &#8220;outside attack&#8221;. It has been softened up and subverted from within. A Trojan horse has done its job and now the barbarians are pouring through the gates. The baffled and confused populace are milling about, wondering what is going on   &mdash;  - what are their elected representatives going to do about this?  Why have they failed to protect them?  Which party should they vote for at the next election? <br>
 <br>
And the invaders keep coming.</p>

		<p>avertculturaldemise essentially asks the billion dollar question:</p>
<p>how did the left wing, the political class, the corporate elite, and the punditocracy all conspire to promote immigration at levels that can only destroy European civilization??</p>
<p>no, this is NOT  a garbled conspiracy theory, but instead an explanation of how the interests of the corporate oligarchy converge with the interests of the political class, including career leftists:</p>
<p>A surplus of labor means lower labor costs and workers terrified of losing jobs and ready to make concessions.</p>
<p>A population lacking common roots and fighting amongst themselves means no organizing among workers.</p>
<p>It also means no shared political aspirations, leaving mindless consumerism (bread and circuses) as the sole preoccupation of social atoms, and the political elite left to run things without the distraction of an informed citizenry.</p>
<p>The left, meanwhile, defines itself by self-hatred, and fetishize alien cultures as morally superior, no matter how barbaric they might be. This dovetails nicely with consumerism: the world as a smorgasbord of places to visit, exotic people to admire, a distraction from the problems of one&rsquo;s own culture. </p>
<p>Pampered bureaucrats, out of touch with reality, believe that population shortfalls in Europe can be replaced with Africans and Arabs, a solution to falling white birthrates that only exacerbates the problem (immigrants on welfare will not pay the pensions of aging workers, but only bankrupt the state faster).</p>
<p>Corporate leaders cannot imagine a shrinking economy, and perpetual growth is only possible was perpetual POPULATION growth.</p>
<p>A lot of corporate leaders in Europe have long since realized that most of the new immigrants are not very productive (North African immigrants in the Netherlands have IQs around 80, compared to the Dutch IQ average of circa 106, and are essentially unemployable, a criminal underclass resembling the black ghettos of the United States, something that did not exist anywhere in Europe until the 1990s!).</p>
<p>A lot of people in government are disillusioned with the immigrants as well (crime, welfare dependency, inability to assimilate, educational failure), but can&rsquo;t backtrack because of the Geert Wilders affect, i.e.: talk realistically about immigration and incompatibility between Islamic and European cultures, be accused of being a Nazi and thrown in jail.</p>
<p>Practically everyone in Europe, meanwhile, knows that this tanker is about to crash into an iceberg, but no one seems to know how to turn around.</p>
<p>Or to use another metaphor: Europe is sleepwalking off a cliff edge, and when it wakes up, it might be too late, because it will already be falling into the abyss.</p>
