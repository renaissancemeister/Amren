			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louise Brown, Toronto Star, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was a dormitory fight rooted in religion, between a Muslim student rising early to cook breakfast during the fast of Ramadan  &mdash;  and a roommate furious at being wakened before sunrise day after day.</p>
<p>When tensions boiled over, the Muslim student threw the first punch  &mdash;  and got himself kicked out of the University of Toronto residence, says Sandy Hudson, the dormitory don at the time, who disagreed with the decision.</p>
<p>The sociology major cites it as an example of why a sweeping new report on campus racism in Ontario calls for <a href="/news/2010/03/whos_still_bias.html#training" target="training-in-canada" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration:none"><b>sensitivity training</b></a> for everyone from dons and professors to campus police.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by the Canadian Federation of Students in Ontario, the report chronicles tales of racism and a &#8220;culture of white privilege&#8221; gathered last year at hearings on 14 campuses, and calls for an array of changes, from overhauling curriculum that is too Eurocentric to &#8220;anti-oppression training&#8221; for students during orientation.</p>
<p>&#8220;With some sensitivity training to the broader issue, that incident might have been better handled,&#8221; says Hudson, now president of the University of Toronto&rsquo;s Student Union and one of nine members of the task force whose 60-page report was released Monday.</p>
<p>Students reported acts of overt racism: a Queen&rsquo;s University student said she was spit on and told to go back to Pakistan; a swastika was painted on a Guelph university washroom wall; the &#8220;N-word&#8221; was scrawled on the door of York University&rsquo;s Black Student Alliance office.</p>
<p>But they also spoke of more subtle feelings of exclusion, something retired York University professor Frances Henry said shows student bodies are diversifying faster than universities have kept up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, students aren&rsquo;t seeing themselves reflected in the faculty or the policies of universities, and there&rsquo;s a tendency to deny that the hallowed halls of learning could harbour racism,&#8221; said Henry, a specialist in anti-racism and member of the task force.</p>
<p>She praised Ryerson University for a recent exhaustive report into the more subtle forms of racism some report experiencing at the booming downtown campus  &mdash;  and the university&rsquo;s vow to tackle any kind of exclusion.</p>
<p>The University of Toronto also promotes inclusion in policies governing everything from room rentals to free speech, said Rob Steiner, vice-president of communications.</p>
<p>The report also calls for:</p>
<p>* Special consideration for applicants from under-represented groups, such as disabled people, members of visible minorities and low-income students.</p>
<p>* &#8220;Equity audits&#8221; to ensure diversity in hiring in every faculty. About 15 per cent of university teachers in Canada are from visible minorities; often they&rsquo;re clustered in engineering, business and commerce.</p>
<p>* Mentoring programs for international students, such as Lakehead University&rsquo;s International Buddy program.</p>
<p>* Encouraging students of more diverse backgrounds to write for campus newspapers.</p>
<p>* Dedicated funding for courses in equity studies, which are often at risk of cancellation for small enrolment.<br>

It&rsquo;s the forcing of people together that&rsquo;s the problem. Let peeople self-segregate and there won&rsquo;t be any of these problems.</p>
<p>Of course, the solution will be more forcing of people together.</p>
<p>And why must we learn tolerance? Why aren&rsquo;t these people expected to learn tolerance toward us? If not tolerance, call it respect.<br>

		<p>&#8216;sensitivity training&rsquo; is about being as insensitive as possible to whites and calling it &#8216;enlightenment&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s pretty much a matter of blaming all problems in society, everywhere on the globe, past and present, on whites individually and as a group.</p>

<p>#1. If it was &#8220;a fight rooted in religion&#8221;, then it was not about &#8220;racism&#8221; &hellip;. it was about religion.</p>
<p>#2. Why shouldn&rsquo;t these two people, from two very different religious traditions, be assigned to separate living quarters with others of their own group?  Would that not be more sensible?<br>
But no, everybody has to be FORCED together in the name of Diversity.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s never a recommendation to help develop a Euro-Canadian identity among white students. Why is that? Everyone recognizes that diversity is changing the demographics. What was once a white majority country with a Christian, British, and European identity is now being changed. It would seem obvious and fair to give students of this background the opportunity to reform as an ethnic group. Moreover, there is something wrong with the government privileging already existing religions and ethnic identities from other parts of the world that have moved to Canada but discouraging whites from ethnic evolution. When the government gets involved in privileging some groups over others that is fascism.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Canadian universities beset by &ldquo;culture of white privilege&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada is well into increasing incidents of non-white crime and violence, and since they&rsquo;re such brainwashed and programmed non-thinking robots I seriously doubt that they will ever be able to see the folly of their actions even if the non-whites capture and kill them all.</p>
<p>The multicults themselves are reported to be amazed that the fools have swallowed all their propaganda so thoroughly without question that they can&rsquo;t believe their own successes.</p>
<p>Canada will go the way of Haiti and Rhodesia.</p>

		<p>Perhaps what Mrs. Henry perceives as &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;exclusion&#8221; is actually resentment over being replaced by aliens in their own country.  One wonders if she would be as judgmental toward Native Americans who resented white settlers or Kurds who resented Arab encroachers. </p>

		<p>It seems that every outrage against people of European stock on college campuses has the racist phrase of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in its rationale for oppression and thought control. It goes to show that the demonizing and racist &#8220;whiteness&#8221; studies that are at Princeton and many other universities are taking root and creating a dangerous paradigm. As whites fail to reproduce and put themselves under the control of those who are demographically displacing them, whiteness studies will help to make whites the Jews of the 21st century  &mdash;  blamed for every wrong, rounded up, and subjected to every horror. Only this time  &mdash;  there will be no whites to come to the rescue. It is time to expose &ldquo;whiteness studies&rdquo; for being nothing but a blatant and hate filled pseudoscience. Google &ldquo;whiteness studies&rdquo; and see the face of evil coming your way and the way of the children that you love.</p>

		<p>What a bunch of baloney.  Why do the Canadians, and those of us here in the States, have to go to mandatory training to learn to tolerate immigrants, as if WE are the ones in the wrong country?</p>
<p>If I had a roommate named Jimmy O&rsquo;Brien who liked to get up at the crack of dawn and cook bacon and eggs I&rsquo;d be just as man as I would at Abu Farooq.  This has nothing to do with race, as one poster pointed out, nor do I think it&rsquo;s about religion.</p>

		<p>It never ends.  If I showed these sorts of articles (which show up almost every day at Amren) to a liberal 20 years ago (using my handy time machine) he would be certain that they were parodies, not serious articles.  Not wanting to be woken up early by some Muslim cooking his Ramadan breakfast is now &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  If a Muslim wants to see a faculty that looks like himself, he should attend a university in Saudi Arabia or Iran.  If a black African wants to see a faculty that looks like himself, he should attend a university in Africa.  If a Mestizo wants to see a faculty that looks like himself, he should attend a university in Mexico.  It is outrageous that people from other countries come to countries created by people of European descent and then demand that we change for their convenience.<br>

<p>What babies! So their own psychological failings are the fault of White students? During my college years the NY state university that I attended had &#8216;Asian Occasions&rsquo; and &#8216;Latin&rsquo; parties, but I never felt excluded. Heck, I did&rsquo;nt want to go in any case! </p>
<p>Comtemporary Western civilization turns all historic experience on its head. What other civilization over the course of human experience has not only thrown open its gates to outsiders, but actually punishes its own citizens merely for going about their own business! </p>
<p>I feel like going back to college for a few courses just for the amusement of asking these sensitive interlopers &#8220;how are foreign students treated in your country? Does Pakistan/India/China/Mexico allow mass immigration? How well are foreign workers paid?&#8221; I already know the answers, but it would be a gas to make them uncomfortable. </p>

		<p>All sensitivity training does is sensitize the majority AGAINST the favored minority.  Any normal person is going to resent being told he&rsquo;s responsible for all the ills of those unlike him  &mdash;  particularly those who are already getting numerous perks simply because they&rsquo;re not white or Christian.  <br>
The truth is that most people are racist, ethnocentric, and nativist.  Most don&rsquo;t hate other groups, but they prefer their own.  And they know the truth concerning who excels in brain and in brawn.</p>

		<p>The answer is, of course, to hire more minority professors.  That will solve the problem.  Oh, wait, American universities have been doing that for years and the students still largely self-segregate.  </p>
<p>The answer must be to get more minorities in the colleges.  Oh, wait, American colleges have lowered standards across the board and given other special dispensations to make that happen, and still the minority graduation rate is abysmally low.</p>
<p>I know, put the kids together in integrated dorms.  Oh, wait, then the whites offend the minorities by not accepting their &#8216;diverse&rsquo; values and habits.  </p>
<p>So the final solution is clear: more anti-white propaganda directed towards white students.  This will cure them of their &#8216;insensitivity&rsquo; for sure!</p>

		<p>To poster #19</p>
<p>This is a serious problem.  This whole white priviledge thing is really spiraling out of control.  Like you, I never had any special leg up from my skin color.  If you grew up in a place where everyone is the same color as you, being that color means nothing.</p>
<p>In China, being Chinese is nothing special.  If an African goes to live in China (which many have) then of course they will have a hard time cracking the nut of success there.  The white priviledge crowd doesn&rsquo;t realize that the majority of any country have natural advantages in internal community relations.</p>
<p>I can go to a white family reunion, but if I&rsquo;m not related, they won&rsquo;t give me free hot dogs, no matter how much I preach about inequalities!</p>
<p>The trouble with the white priviledge thing is that it has taken on a life of its own, and stupid white female liberals are parroting this line and neutered white males do it as well.</p>
<p>It is now gospel truth in academia that all whites living on earth today are guilty of oppression and evil, simply by a loose association with the 5% of white people centuries ago who mistreated non-whites here and there.</p>
<p>Even if a Finn from Finland comes over to America and settles down, he will be blamed for the white male power structure and oppressing minorities.  It&rsquo;s really insane, and those liberals do not care, when confronted with the possible extinction of the white race.  They will tell you to your face, &#8220;Good, I hope all white people perish.&#8221;  And they&rsquo;re white!  Such is the amount of self-hatred they&rsquo;ve become warped by.</p>
<p>Whites need to protect themselves with the creation of separate nations where no non-whites are allowed save for marriage.  We can dilute a few non-whites here and there.  (Can&rsquo;t stand in the way of love!)  But no work visas.  No immigration save for the direst of needs like doctors or something. And a cap that no more than 5% of the population, at any time, can be non-white. </p>

<p><br>
In fact, I have gotten lesser marks on test scores (as for jobs) than I should have had, because I didn&rsquo;t qualify for any of the minority credits, living experience, poverty, single mother, or many other special boosts that are designed to raise their scores  artificially. Thus, all I got was my bare test score, plain and unenhanced by any extras. And after it was &#8220;adjusted&#8221; it was lower on the list than originally. </p>
<p>Still, I did well, but if given a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; (which they&rsquo;re always crying about), I would have done even better.  In truth, a level playing field is the last thing they want. They demand special privileges and special help.  Despite all their campaigning, they don&rsquo;t really want equality.   Their insistance on affirmative action is proof of it.</p>
<p>How odd that after raising the roof and keeping the nation in turmoil for much the past century, it turns out that&rsquo;s not what they really want at all!!!</p>

		<p>Just more examples of code language that the communists have developed to destroy Western Civilization.  And this is not a fantasy, read their own writings.  What we have here is a situation that will ultimately end in violence, ie. either we get them first or they surely will take us out.  Sort of like the white genocide ongoing in South Africa only it will be the death of whites all across the world.</p>

Later, this guy was &#8220;raptured&#8221;:  because of his race, he was UPLIFTED from us regular working joes and given a job in the bank   &mdash;   even though we knew he wasn&rsquo;t filling out his forms well because he could barely read or write English!</p>

That&rsquo;s very interesting. Virginia, last month, near DC, at time of  the scheduled  Amren conference had experienced one heavy snow storm after another and was all snowed in. Our van driver from the hotel (a white American, a rarity there), remarked that the other drivers, from places like Morocco and Somalia, had simply refused to drive in the snow. They wouldn&rsquo;t go out in it.  So they didn&rsquo;t. They weren&rsquo;t punished.  (We have to respect their culture, after all!)</p>
