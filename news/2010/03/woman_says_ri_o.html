<h1><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=10169008">Woman Says RI Officer Raped Her, Came to Hospital</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Tucker, AP, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman who says she was raped by an on-duty Providence police officer testified Monday that the man came into her hospital room grinning and in uniform after the alleged attack in 2007.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old woman said she recalled seeing officer Marcus Huffman in the hours after the alleged rape, but told the jury that she could not remember how long he was there or anything else about the encounter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Huffman, who is charged with first-degree sexual assault in Providence Superior Court, raped the woman in the bathroom of an empty police substation after offering her a ride outside a nightclub where she had been turned away for being too drunk.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Maureen Keough asked the woman if she had given any indication that she wanted to have sex with Huffman, and she said, &#8220;No.&#8221; She testified that she identifies herself as a lesbian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The woman said she was feeling sick from a night of heavy drinking on March 17, 2007 and was turned away by the club&rsquo;s owner when Huffman, in his marked police cruiser, offered her a ride so she could use a bathroom. She said she remembered being driven to the substation and then waking up in a bathroom stall there with her pants undone and her undergarments removed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Huffman has been suspended without pay from the department. His accuser is due back on the stand Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s a liberal to do?  For whom should they hold the candlelight vigil?  Will it be &#8220;Take back the night&#8221; or &#8220;Free Marcus now?&#8221;  Which will be the most fashionable cause at all the best Hollywood parties?  So many terrible decisions!<br>

		<p>Will we ever really know what happened here? These two are very likely not what one would call reliable witnesses, especially when they are the ones concerned. Maybe he&rsquo;s just another horny black rapist with a badge, or perhaps she tried to screw her way out of trouble or even did, and didn&rsquo;t get the payoff she was promised or expecting. She has readily admitted she is a whore. Either way Looks to me like the no harm no foul rule applies here. The judge should throw them both out of court along with the rest of the trash.</p>

<p>I cannot believe what I am reading. The comments I am seeing here are outrageous. I am finding myself in a twilight zone, in which I am a non-white who is defending a (presumably) white woman, who was sexually assaulted by a black thug in police uniform.</p>
<p>It is well known that women who are drunk, are not in a position to give informed consent to have sex. Do any of you have daughters in college? If it was your daughter who got drunk, do you believe that she should be easy-pickings for some despicable and desperate thug, who cannot get a date with sober women?</p>
<p>Even if it were proven that the sex in this case was consensual, Officer Huffman&rsquo;s conduct was totally unprofessional, and should be subject to disciplinary action. Police officers on duty are not supposed to use their official cars to pick up women. It is illegal in many jurisdictions for officers to drink on duty. Having sex with strangers is considered a far worse offence than drinking on duty, in any well run police department.</p>
<p>You may accuse the woman of irresponsibility. But irresponsibility does not deprive her of her civil rights. I just cannot believe how hard-hearted some are on this forum.  <br>

<p>Fully agree, even is the sex was consensual, which I highly doubt,  he is a police officer on duty and should get in legal trouble as that is totally unethical. </p>

<p>Maybe, unless a woman is an alcoholic and can&rsquo;t help when and where she is drunk, she should not get drunk in public in the first place? That would drop her chance of being raped quite a bit.  This is not &#8220;blaming the victim&#8221;. This is just common sense, the same as not going into a bad neighborhood late at night.</p>
<p>Why is it that women can freely get all messed up and whatever happens to them is not their fault, even though they put themselves in a position to be taken advantage of? The victim mentality here is too much for me.</p>

		<p>FYI, Deepak (#4), men are falsely accused of rape every day, or do we have to rehash the whole Duke lacrosse hoax here? (Thank God for <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/" rel="nofollow">these folks</a>.) I&rsquo;d like to know why the woman wasn&rsquo;t given a sexual assault exam at the hospital and her clothing wasn&rsquo;t taken into evidence   &mdash;   a DNA test would have nailed or cleared the cop right there.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the radical feminists have always opposed DNA evidence in such cases   &mdash;   they <i>want to be able to send any man they dislike to prison on nothing more than their say-so, as was often the case previously.</i></p>
<p>Black or white, drunk or sober, the rule of law must prevail and the accused is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. After reading the full article three times, I can find no credible evidence to back up the woman&rsquo;s allegations. If I were on the jury and the trial ended tomorrow, I would be forced to vote for acquittal on that basis. And if the woman concocted the whole story (a distinct possibility), she should have the book thrown at her.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of capital punishment for rapists, but if you choose to get drunk, don&rsquo;t complain if you get hurt.  A man who rapes drunk women is as foul a piece of dirt as one who rapes sober women, but who is to say that the drunken woman did not give her consent?  Probably all of us have at one time been astonished at the behavior of someone we thought we knew, when we saw them drunk.  This woman chose to disconnect her capacity for sound judgement, so she might have agreed to anything.  Her statements on the morning after do not have the weight of her decision to get stupid the night before.  <br>
     Of course the cop should be fired and lose his pension rights.  It should not take a rape conviction to get rid of a bad cop.</p>

<p>Women or men are free to get drunk if they wish. If a very drunk woman is raped, she is not taken advantage of, she is raped and that is totally the fault of the rapist. The fact that she was drunk is irrelevant. It&rsquo;s not  her fault because she was drunk anymore than if she were sober. Crime isn&rsquo;t justifiable or any more the victim&rsquo;s fault because of what he/she(the victim) does.<br>

<p>She most likely was given an exam, she was in the hospital afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m in favor of capital punishment for rapists, but if you choose to get drunk, don&rsquo;t complain if you get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody has the right to hurt you if you get drunk and you have every right to complain. Let&rsquo;s face it, all of us, men or women, have likely gone out and had a little too much to drink at one time or another, especially when we were young. It happens and doesn&rsquo;t make one bit of difference when it comes to the issue of fault and crime, always the criminal&rsquo;s fault. Being drunk  doesn&rsquo;t make it the victim&rsquo;s fault at all. Of course, it would be harder to get a conviction if she doesn&rsquo;t remember certain things. Hypothetically, if it was consensual, which I don&rsquo;t beleive for one moment, the cop should still be fired and charged with abuse of public office.</p>

		<p>My previous post may have given the impression that it is OK to rape a woman who is drunk or otherwise impared. That is not the case, just like it is not OK for a man who goes to a bad neighborhood at night to get robbed, beaten, or murdered. The perpetrator(s) are still wrong and the victim still the victim. But I have to ask, in each case, isn&rsquo;t the person involved taking unnecesary risks by doing so?</p>
<p>As an aside, about &#8220;Women or men are free to get drunk if they wish&#8221;, public intoxication is a criminal offense, so to say it is OK or someone has the right to do so is not true, not with our current laws, anyway.</p>

<p>Are you saying anyone that gets drunk in public should take responsibility if they are physically assaulted by larger individuals? So if a skinny 120 lb year old male were to become drunk it is HIS fault if he is raped by stronger 225 lb males?</p>
<p>New rule, sound like something that would apply in Africa.</p>

		<p>If a White person chooses to shut down the higher brain functions that distinguish them from Africans, then they are likely to find themselves playing by African rules.  For example, an otherwise sensible and intelligent man I knew, while drunk, once deliberately pointed a loaded gun at me to make a point in conversation.  He was not angry, we weren&rsquo;t arguing, he was just demonstrating something.  If he&rsquo;d accidently pulled the trigger and it had made the news, many posters here would reflexively and reasonably have thought, &#8220;Blacks shooting Blacks&#8221;.  Drunks are guilty of self-imposed stupidity, and are not entitled to the sympathy due an ordinary retarded person.  <br>
     This does not mean that the criminal that takes advantage of a drunk&rsquo;s incapacity is any less vile than if they had abused a sober person.  It means that the victim is a willing fool, and while they didn&rsquo;t deserve to be raped or robbed or whatever, they don&rsquo;t deserve a lot of sympathy either.  And it also means that they are an unreliable witness in court, and that a thinking jury is unlikely to send someone to prison on their testimony.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s good for anyone, men or women, to get drunk in public and yes one can get arrested for PI. I&rsquo;m just saying that it doesn&rsquo;t justify raping a woman or robbing a man or whatever. It&rsquo;s a crime and the criminal&rsquo;s fault just as much as if one was sober.<br>
