			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kitty Caparella &amp; Stephanie Farr, Philadelphia Daily News, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Business owners yesterday called on Mayor Nutter to stop &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; on South Street after patrons couldn&rsquo;t shop, dine or get home on Saturday night because of the hordes of teens roaming the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Inspired by Twitter messages to &#8220;come to South Street,&#8221; police say hundreds  &mdash;  business owners say thousands  &mdash;  of young teens stampeded down South Street in waves, jumping on top of cars, knocking over pedestrians and fighting and cursing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s was the sixth flash mob to hit the city since last May: three on South Street; two in the Gallery, including one that spread to Macy&rsquo;s; and one along Market Street East that spread to the area near City Hall.</p>
<p>Several store owners and managers documented the stampede with cell phones or store surveillance tape.</p>
<p>A pizza shop owner said that some in the mob were chanting, &#8220;Black Boys!&#8221; and &#8220;Burn the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>One youth was overheard on his cell phone saying: &#8220;Bring baseball bats to South Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the mood turned ominous as more and more teens showed up by 8 p.m. Between 9 and 10 p.m. the packed crowds reached a crescendo, according to police officials who deployed highway patrol, narcotics strike force and other units to assist officers on South Street. A parent, who had seen a text message or a post on Facebook, alerted police about the potential flash mob.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One armed owner, who showed the Daily News his gun permit, protected his business by standing outside with five assistants.</p>
<p>At Supper, a restaurant in the 900 block, bartender Kyle Fennie opened the locked door to let two woman customers out, but a mass of teens descended, and he let the women back inside. During a lull, he walked them to their cars.</p>
<p>About 10 p.m., police fanned out at either 2nd or 3rd Street and gradually moved the crowds west on South ot Broad. Kids started running at top speed, with some going around the block, and coming up behind the cops.</p>
<p>About 10:30 p.m. on South near 6th, Olympia Pizza II employee Seth Kaufman, 20, was in front of the pizza shop, trying to prevent kids from coming inside to fight with young customers who were eating.</p>
<p>As the crowd pushed the door to get inside, Kaufman pushed back. The crowd pushed again, and inside, the owners, 66-year-old Peter Psihogios, his wife, Harula, 58, and son Paul, 30, were pushing back on the store&rsquo;s double glass doors to keep them shut.</p>
<p>Kaufman said that kids slugged him, and he slugged them back, and then he was jumped, with kids kicking and punching him until he fell.</p>
<p>The elder Psihogios tried to bring Kaufman inside, but he was punched in the head.</p>
<p>Kaufman has bruises all over his body from face to legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He saved our establishment from them coming in,&#8221; said Paul Psihogios. &#8220;We owe him a lot of gratitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said the incident was over by 1 a.m.</p>
<p>No property damage was reported but two juveniles and an adult were arrested in four incidents, police said. They included:</p>
<p>* About 11 p.m. a 27-year-old woman was walking on South near 15th when a large group of male and female juveniles ganged up on her, kicking and punching her until she fell to the ground, where they continued to kick her in the face and head. She was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital, where she was treated for bruises, abrasions and a large laceration on her upper lip. She has since been released. No arrests were made.</p>

		<p>This is just a harbinger of what will be the norm probably next year or the year after. But, then again, we just might get a preview of coming attractions by the end of this year.  It depends on how fast the economy goes even further south between now and then.  </p>
<p>Right now they appear to be &#8220;flashing&#8221; just for fun, but These same black mobs will soon be protesting cuts in social benefits and using the deteriorating economic conditions as an excuse to loot and rob, as well as anything else they can think of.  </p>
<p>Nothing scares leftist dregs more than black riots and violence and they are ready to do anything&hellip;including prostituting themselves&hellip;to prevent the chaos.  They&rsquo;re like trembling children, afraid of every sound around them.</p>
<p>Those that work at the local T.V. station refuse to admit the rioters are black, listing them only as &#8220;youths.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>It seems to me that this would be a perfect area to hand out leaflets about white solidarity.  This should be done in the near future, while memories of those &#8220;young people&#8221; are still fresh.  The flier could say something like &#8220;White Solidarity. It is no longer a luxury; it is a matter of survival!&#8221; and there would be contact information on the bottom.  Preferably an email address.</p>

		<p>Will there be 13 detectives from the Philly PD working this case?  There are 13 detectives working on a teenage prank at a Wal-Mart very near Philadelphia.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s strange about the way this article is written is that it uses the phrase &#8220;But the mood turned more ominous&#8221; (after the second snip).  Notice all the things that happened that the Philadelphia Daily News does not consider &#8220;ominous,&#8221; in that they wrote about it before that sentence:   Stampeding down a street, jumping on top of cars, knocking over pedestrians, imploring &#8220;black boys&#8221; to &#8220;burn the city,&#8221; and a call to bring baseball bats.   </p>
<p>I looked at the pictures, and most of the members of the flash mob look like healthy and well-dressed young men and women, so poverty can&rsquo;t be an excuse.  I noticed most of the victims were white, but they showed one black employee of a sporting goods store.  I get the feeling they tried to find a black victim as hard as they could and play it up, to downplay the race hate aspect of this flash mob.  They can&rsquo;t seem to find a non-black or non-blackish Hispanic member of this mob.</p>

<p>So &hellip; what do we have in Philadelphia? White leftists, Black punks. The decent White (and Black) middle-class does not like the Black punks; the decent Black (and White) middle-class does not like the White exhibitionists. </p>
<p>Both the Black punks and the White exhibitionists are displaying their own version of nihilism. </p>

<p>So it took the police &#8220;only&#8221; five hours to disperse the mob?  </p>

<p>A good thing, too.  When seconds count, the police are just minutes away.</p>
<p>Is it my imagination, or does it seem that the people who crow that &#8220;diversity is our greatest strength&#8221; are the same people who advocate victim-disarmament laws?  </p>

		<p>Because one kid made a joke at Walmart, the media got crazy.<br>
Let&rsquo;s look how much they will talk about this black mop beating whites.</p>
<p>Something I really do not understand about Americans is, they always say white South Africans were stupid not to get together and separate a part of the country for only whites but only wanted the whole country and now have nothing.<br>
But white Americans should actually do the same because they are in a similar situation now and if they do not hurry up, they will lose whole United States.<br>
The time has come, in a few decades it might be too late. </p>

		<p>Look at the face in the picture. The concept of &#8220;educating&#8221; such a &#8220;youth&#8221; seems preposterous. The concept of locking him up for life  &mdash;  which inevitably will happen one day or another  &mdash;  seems a waste of perfectly good resources.</p>

<p>Who cares? We need to focus on serious cases of racism - like the 16-year-old kid in Wal Mart who grabbed a microphone and made a joke about blacks. A white woman being savagely beaten by blacks doesn&rsquo;t count as racism. Whites may be somewhat human. But civil rights and hate crimes are certainly not for them.</p>

		<p>Calling these flash mobs is stupid, flash mobs were originally a white thing, kids organizing via text messaging and instant messages to pull of hilarious pranks like a thousands of people simultaneously doing the moon walk or people all converging in a small area dressed like santa claus.</p>
<p>This is just blacks doing what they do best  &mdash;  waging all out war on their ultimate enemy  &mdash;  civilization itself. Only when the whole world is dragged down to Haiti levels can the young African male armed with a blunt object  take his rightful place at the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>And blacks will point this out after a black riot or wilding.</p>
<p>But the difference is that when white geeks have a huge meet-up it is to get naked, sing silly songs or engage in dorky antics. They may be stupid (and somewhat pathetic in the case of the nudists - most of whom should not be nude)but it is harmless.</p>
<p>Compare this to what blacks do - beatings, riots, rapes, fights, assaults, smashing property, targeting non-blacks for crimes &hellip;etc.<br>

		<p>&#8221; Young people&#8221;. Only the first word is accurate!<br>
This has been going on for quite a while. Gangs of blacks assaulting Whites. These swarm down on their victims like biting flies.  That&rsquo;s probably why the Hispanics in East Los Angeles call them &#8220;mayates&#8221;. It makes sense.<br>
 We need to start defending ourselves by all means necessary. This will cease after a few incidents in which the primitives collide with a curtain of lead. Any White who is still in denial about the real agenda of these beasts should be committed to an asylum. </p>

But white Americans should actually do the same</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard whites &#8220;always saying that.&#8221; But that&rsquo;s begging the question anyway. The real question is why whites in both SA and the US gave in to the PC madness in the first place. If that hadn&rsquo;t happened, we wouldn&rsquo;t have reached the point where there would be talk about breaking up.</p>

<p>Kudos to Seth. He&rsquo;s got the right stuff. But a word of advice. When you&rsquo;re outnumbered like that you&rsquo;re better off locking the door. And standing behind the plate glass where they can see you exercising your constitutional right to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p>Not one racial description of the perpetrators! NOT ONCE! Had the mob-of-color been white, you can be sure the press would&rsquo;ve identified them by race!</p>
<p>It is my long-time fantasy to magically drop-off one of these bleeding heart, media-types or and politicos in any heavily black-populated urban zone throughout this once-great land, say around midnight on a sweltering hot Friday or Saturday night during the summer. Oh, how I wish that could be done! Maybe then they&rsquo;d see things through our lens! On second thought, most of them are pathetically hopeless and would find a way to blame the blacks&rsquo; actions on &#8220;white racism&#8221;  &mdash;  provided they escaped from there alive. :-) </p>
<p>OH, and by the way, did the Philly police chief stop everything and assign all detectives in his dept. as well as call in reinforcements to identify and apprehend these hoodlums-of-color a.s.a.p., charging them with &ldquo;harassment and bias intimidation,&rdquo; among other things??</p>
<p>You know the answer to that&hellip;</p>

		<p> Has there ever been a &#8220;flash mob&#8221; in America that wasn&rsquo;t a black mob? It appears that whites were randomly attacked, and Seth Kaufman was savagely beaten for absolutely no reason. Recently, our controlled media has been obsessed by some prankster making a bogus announcement at a Wal-Mart; what about whites being attacked by black mobs in Philly? I honestly think many of our white ultra-liberals need to be dropped off in South Street some hot summer evening. </p>

		<p>To poster #1, yes this is becoming much more common now.  I remember hearing about the riots in Ohio ten years ago.  What?  Ohio?  Now these flash mobs are occuring in cities all over.</p>
<p>The targets are always white.</p>
<p>Why is this not mentioned in the media?</p>
<p>To poster #9  I also have the same thoughts.  But about S.A., I do believe the whites could still push for a territory even now to be their own country, but then those idiots would just let more voodoo workers in to be domestics.</p>

		<p>According to the article, this is the SIXTH &#8216;flash mob&rsquo; to hit Philly recently. Folks, I see this as a training exercise for future mayhem. Don&rsquo; think that certain groups aren&rsquo;t watching and taking notes. Watch for these mobs to start becoming more and more organized. Philly business owners: start buying guns and ammo. These tools will save you and your families lives.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new. About 22 years ago I worked on the docks and took the El to and from work. My (mostly black) coworkers and i saw moblets chasing white guys up and down Deleware Ave. Towards the end of the shift I was told &#8220;They beatin&rsquo; up white guys tonite&#8221;. We take you to El. They walked up to Market St. Stood with me till train came and chased off predatory bands of bros. I witness a sleeping drunk get robbed and various depradations in the 12-15 minutes till my train came in. My size escort and a wrench saved my sorry white butt that night.</p>

		<p>Here in Kansas City several years ago the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade was disrupted by a large group of blacks.  At least one shooting occurred and many assaults.  It was clear the black rioters went to the parade simply to cause trouble and assault whites.  The local news reported the incident and blamed the problems on the public consumption of alcohol (by whites presumably).  </p>

		<p>We had another flash mob in the Franklin Mills Mall located in the northeast (mostly) white section of Philadelphia recently.  The mob was smaller in numbers and the police had been tipped off.  The city had transit buses brought in to transport the mob back to their home neighborhoods in the black sections of the city.  I guess that we asked for it.  This section of the city gave the majority of the vote to Obama.  I think that white people have a death wish.</p>

<p>As black numbers, black demands, black lawlessness,  and black arrogance grow, we are going to see more and more of this. Whites need to wake up!  Unless the tide is stemmed   &mdash;   somewhere   &mdash;   we could be facing another &#8220;Haiti&#8221; someday far down the road.  We all know what happened there. Just those pictures (above) show the possibility of it.  Blacks must never be allowed to get out of control. Otherwise, they run amok and do what blacks do.</p>

<p>New Video Shows Flash Mob Violence</p>
<p>Disturbing new video posted on You Tube shows violence during last week&rsquo;s teen flash mob on Philadelphia&rsquo;s South Street.</p>
<p>The video shows teens beating up other teens, seemingly at random.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0dY2B0GVE&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0dY2B0GVE&feature;=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>Only a handful of arrests were made, and most reports indicated that were not injuries during the organized teen gathering.</p>
<p>The video, if it is authentic, shows obvious violence during the melee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until flash mobs converge on isolated homes for a little of the old ultra-violence.</p>
<p>A Clockwork Black. Coming soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I won&rsquo;t open my door to anyone claiming that there&rsquo;s been a terrible accident and they need to use my phone.  I know of a local woman living a ways out of town on some property, who had just that happen.  She did not open the door either, but called the police.  </p>
<p>The home invasions recently happen like this: A knock on the door, the unsuspecting party opens the door and the invasion begins.  The trick is to have a peep hole, and maybe even a cam on your door.  Unfortunately, no one smart can simply open their door to a knock anymore.  BE AWARE.</p>
<p>Other good ideas; Keep your front door locked at all times. Be aware of what is happening in your neighborhood.  Know your neighbors and talk to them often.</p>

<p>1) Calling these gangs of lawless predators a &#8220;flash mob&#8221; is a misnomer. Flash mobs were groups of harmless Whites enagaging in amusing to dumb non-violent pranks. </p>

		<p>As the ratio of blacks to whites increases, it will be harder for whites to get away from black mobs.  Philadelphia has had a massive a amount of black on white violence for generations and many of the poor and working class whites are racially aware, but they have no support from the police, politicians, &#8220;business community&#8221; or anyone else with power.</p>

<p>I am sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean white Americans always say this. If they would, America would be a much better place. But most of American comments on Youtube about South Africa say this.</p>
<p>&#8220;he real question is why whites in both SA and the US gave in to the PC madness in the first place. &#8220;</p>
<p>That is a very good question. I think that the reason is the people of the Hippi-generation are now at power. And if you understand this, you will see why I am full of hope: </p>
<p>This people raised in a time when all threaten was from white Soviets against USA and other white countries. The people of that time were living in an absolute paradise. They were able to go anywhere they wanted, they could come home late without beaten up by gangs, they were everything and the only bad thing was the threaten by white wars. And now they are at power. And still they see the threat only by whites.</p>
<p>But now they are getting old. A new generation is raising. A generation which must always be scared to be beaten up by gangs, a generation which is everyday hearing nothing else but the blacks whining about racism, a generation which has not to be scared by whites but only by immigrants (in Europe) and blacks in USA.<br>
And this generation, my generation, is going to get power, hating PC and seeing it leads always to problems wherever diversity is. And that is why the media and politics are in panic. They are really scared of the new generation and try anything to teach them diversity is a strength and whites are to blame. But they don&rsquo;t listen cause they know who they have to be scared of and who not, when they drive bus.</p>
<p>I think this new generation will end PC. Maybe we will lose some areas but we will be able to live in freedom again -by separation.</p>

		<p>Quite easy to brand the crowd as &#8220;teenagers&#8221; instead of blacks. Additionally using this age group would furthermore diminish the reality of the situation. By painting this as &#8216;restless teenagers&rsquo; getting a little out of hand, the libs get to once again sterilize the truth.<br>
In all reality &hellip;. this is nothing short of the black community coming out en-mass and taking over and terrorizing the city. No doubt a good cross section of age groups were represented here. To paint it as such would be telling the truth and that we just can not expect from the media &amp; our government these days&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  </p>

<p>Seth? Kaufman? Are you kidding me? FYI, many Jewish people have German surnames. Seth is a common name for a male in the Jewish community  &mdash;  not Germanic. Having said that, I applaud Seth for his courage; he should file charges claiming this was an anti-semitic attack! And why not? If Seth and a mob of whites beat up a black delevery man the very first thing out the black victim&rsquo;s mouth would be: &#8220;This was racially-motivated!&#8221; Ditto the police!!<br>

The anger of blacks is not only directed at whites, though by a huge majority it is - black are just angry. Period. At everyone and everything. They fight with each other even more than they fight with whites. They are angry from the time they wake up until they drop. The only time they&rsquo;re not is when they have everything they want at the second they want it without any effort. That&rsquo;s pretty hard to achieve. The difference between them and [most] whites is that whites have some measure of self control.</p>

<p>  He may be, but we don&rsquo;t really know. It is irrelevant. One thing we know for sure is that his black assailants only saw him as a white man. Most blacks, and whites for that matter, can&rsquo;t identify Jews except for those religious Jews who dress accordingly. </p>

<p>What is about the white Europe who &#8220;accepted them by inviting them into their homes and welcoming black boys and girls to date their children.&#8221;<br>
and furthermore gave them money, free education, free health care, free houses&hellip; no did they stop murdering and raping?</p>
<p>The very opposite ist the case: 100% of all rapes in Oslo were by immigrants against white women. Again, after the white folk gave them everything for free 100% of all rapes were made bye them against white folk.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Africans are Africans, are Africans, are Africans. Doesn&rsquo;t matter where they live, they will keep on being Africans. And there is a very good reason why a whole continent is poor and was always poor along the whole history, except the areas whites were living in for a short time.</p>
