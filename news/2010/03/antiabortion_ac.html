	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A joint effort of Georgia Right to Life and the pro-adoption, pro-abstinence Radiance Foundation, the campaign ostensibly calls attention to the fact that black women have a disproportionately high number of abortions. But there is a deeper, more disturbing claim at work as well.</p>
<p>An increasingly vocal segment of the antiabortion community has embraced the idea that black women are targeted for abortion in an effort to keep the black population down.</p>
<p>The billboards direct people to a website called toomanyaborted.com, which claims that &#8220;Under the false liberty of &#8216;reproductive freedom&rsquo; we are killing our very future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some black antiabortion activists call the phenomenon &#8220;womb lynching.&#8221; One prominent black cleric, the Rev. Clenard Childress Jr. of New Jersey, often says the most dangerous place for a black child is the womb.</p>
<p>No one disputes that black women have more abortions, proportionately, than women of other races. Nationally, African Americans make up about 13% of the population and have about 37% of all abortions, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Radiance Foundation founder Ryan Bomberger, a 38-year-old former ad man, came up with the idea for the billboards. Adopted as a baby, he said he was conceived when his white biological mother was raped by a black man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am definitely not a white Southern bigot,&#8221; he said, alluding to an accusation hurled his way since the ads went up. &#8220;I am as black as President Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has also been accused of shaming black women who seek abortions. Not so, Bomberger said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s about exposing an industry that is stealing potential from our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Catherine Davis, minority outreach director for Georgia Right to Life, visits black college campuses, bringing the message that abortion is a destructive force for blacks. She often screens a movie called &#8220;Maafa 21,&#8221; made by Texas antiabortion group Life Dynamics, alleging that blacks have been targeted for abortions since the end of slavery by white elites fearful of uncontrolled population growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me put it this way,&#8221; Davis said, &#8220;18,870,000 black babies have been aborted since Roe vs. Wade. If those babies hadn&rsquo;t been aborted, we would be 59 million strong  &mdash;  over 19% of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I know for sure that the black community is being targeted by abortionists for the purpose of ethnic cleansing,&#8221; said King [Alveda King, a niece of Martin Luther King Jr.], a Georgia Right to Life board member who had two abortions before a religious conversion in 1983. &#8220;How can the dream survive if we are willing to sacrifice the futures of our children?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a scenario popularized by abortion foes, the culprit is Planned Parenthood, whose clinics are often located in poor communities where the need for subsidized healthcare is greatest.</p>
<p>The roots of the antipathy toward Planned Parenthood come not just from its role as the nation&rsquo;s largest provider of abortions and other reproductive healthcare, but from questionable social policies embraced by its founder, Margaret Sanger, the mother of the American birth control movement.</p>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s, Sanger was an advocate of eugenics, a movement that posited the human species could be improved with selective breeding and the forced sterilization of the poor and &#8220;feeble-minded.&#8221; That often was believed to include blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black leaders of the day  &mdash;  including W.E.B. Du Bois and Adam Clayton Powell  &mdash;  supported Sanger. &#8220;All these people wanted her to put clinics in African American communities because we then, as now, see fertility control as part of the racial uplift strategy,&#8221; Ross said.</p>
<p>Historian Ellen Chesler [a professor at Hunter College], a Planned Parenthood board member and Sanger biographer, said that Sanger&rsquo;s eugenics views were applicable to sterilization, not abortion, which she generally opposed.</p>
<p>In 1920, Sanger wrote, &#8220;While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion is justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, Chesler noted, eugenics is still with us: &#8220;Its most enduring legacy is IQ testing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Every woman who has amniocentesis is a eugenicist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Make abortions hard to come by, and they scream that &#8220;black women are being denied their reproductive rights.&#8221;  Then, when black women choose to have more abortions than other ethnic groups, they scream that black women are &#8220;being targeted by abortionists for the purpose of ethnic cleansing.&#8221; </p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s so, it certainly isn&rsquo;t working very well, as even a cursory glance at black reproductive rates will show.  Oh, and what percentage of those Evil Racist Abortionists are themselves black?  Has anyone even bothered to find out?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s <i>really</i> pathetic about all this absurd posturing is that the governmedia have created an atmosphere in which the most bizarre black persecution fantasies are actually treated with grave seriousness.  </p>
<p>Are Whites beginning to catch on?  It must be getting increasingly difficult for even the most fanatical White liberals to read such nonsense with a straight face.<br>

		<p>This is always an issue that interests me, particularly on AmRen, one reason being that I know that the vast majority of posters on here are very Pro-Life.  That seems to place these posters in the middle of a dilemma.  I, for one, am very much a moderate on the issue.  However, when it comes to Blacks, I am unabashedly pro-abortion!! This may sound cruel, but we are talking about a population that can&rsquo;t seem to exhibit any sexual restraint, and already has a major problem taking care of their children that are not aborted.  And this nonsensical jabber about &#8220;Black abortion =ethnic cleansing&#8221; enrages me.  As one of many White victims of Black (attempted) murder in this country, it is very clear to me which race is engaging in ethnic cleansing: Blacks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that one out. Is she saying amniocentesis is an IQ test? Amniocentesis checks for genetic abnormalities that will result in birth defects. As the test can be used to justify abortion, I suppose I see her point there, but it was poorly worded.</p>
<p>If she was talking about an IQ test itself being eugenic, that just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

		<p>Blacks increase their numbers relative to whites every year.  So the only &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; I see is of white people.  The antiabortion advocates should grow up and find some argument that isn&rsquo;t about how black people should out breed white people even faster than they do now.</p>

		<p>The truth is that these people are right.  Or rather they are half right.  Blacks are both the victim and the victimizer in the culture of liberal hate.  Liberals are anti-life.  They promote abortion for no other reason than they like to see babies die and that Christianity (which they hate above everything else) opposes this evil.</p>
<p>Blacks are just conveniently accessable to this.  They attach themselves to liberalism because it allows to take white people for a ride with regard to welfare and softness on crime.  But the price they pay for this (actually just one of the many prices they pay for this) is that they are deeply brainwashed into their culture of abortion.  That is the reason for the amount of abortion.  They aren&rsquo;t being specifically targeted anymore than anyone else.  They are just one of the groups open to listening to these fiends.</p>
<p>Or put another way, liberals aren&rsquo;t welcome in white conservative neighborhoods but they are welcome in black communist neighborhoods&hellip;.so that&rsquo;s where they build the abortion clinic.</p>

		<p>As a fundamental Christian, I see a solution that not only makes sense, but allows me to meet BOTH my desires.  Make abortion illegal.  Think about it.  Whites, being law abiding generally, will begin repopulating.  BLACKS, who never care about laws and engage in illegal activity routinely and without thought or guilty consciences, WILL continue to get abortions.  Our population goes up, theirs goes down.  Win win in my book.  And the blacks will be responsible for their own demise with no excuse blaming Whites, while MY conscience is clear also.  </p>

<p>As far as rape is concerned, I do not feel that any woman should be forced by the power of the state to remain pregnant for her rapist.  They might produce another white-hating, crazy advocate like this guy.</p>

		<p>Next time I hear anyone complain about black genocide or that blacks get abortions more, I&rsquo;m going to say, &#8220;Whites have lower birth rates than other races.  I think that&rsquo;s alarm and I don&rsquo;t hear anyone concerned about that?  Besides, blacks have only themselves to blame for the abortions and other immoral behavior that goes on in their country.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#6, I can understand why it seems that blacks are increasing proportionally every year, like Hispanics, but from what I&rsquo;ve read, their numbers have been hovering between 12% and 13% for some time now.  If it weren&rsquo;t for their 50% abortion rate (half of all black babies), their population might be even higher than the LA Times postulates.<br>
Articles like this one seem so double-sided that one must wonder if the writer herself clearly sees the illogic and just pens off the piece anyway.  It&rsquo;s fine for a black woman to speak out against abortion, but the idea that the liberals at Planned Parenthood are trying to wipe out blacks is on par with the contention that the CIA introduced HIV into the ghettos.<br>

		<p>I believe that I&rsquo;ve read that, since Roe v. Wade and the legalization of abortion in America, somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 million white babies have been aborted inside the United States.    Worldwide, the estimates of aborted White babies is near the 100 million mark, according to some of the same sources.  </p>
<p>Now, thanks to some of the efforts of Jared Taylor and American Renaissance&rsquo;s great writing staff, I was made aware of the fact that in 1900, people of European (White) descent constituted somewhere between 30-35% of the entire world&rsquo;s population.   Today, our numbers are gleefully reported by an extremely hostile and hate filled media as being somewhere between 8 and 10% of the entire world&rsquo;s population.   Additional orgasmic-like reporting by the same anti-white media will breathlessly note that in literally no dominant European majority nation is the birthrate of White people at or above, what is commonly referred to as the replacement rate - which works out to something like 2.5 children per white couple.  </p>
<p>Let me cite the 1947/1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide:</p>
<p>This same hostile media, in clear violation of Article 2 paragraph (c) which reads: &#8220;Deliberately inflicting upon the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part&#8221;, is a major cheerleader for massive non-white, third world immigration into America, as well as being fully in favor of granting amnesty to illegal aliens and then allowing them to bring in as many of their relatives as possible via &#8216;family reunification&rsquo; provisions.    The ADL and the SPLC are but two of the many organizations who attack any effort on the part of the dominant white majority to resist being displaced and dispossessed within their native homelands.<br>
Both of these organizations are virulently anti-white and are officially engaged in a conspiracy to genocide the white majority in America.   </p>
<p>But, it doesn&rsquo;t stop there.   This same media also blatantly and with malice aforethought violates Article 2 paragraph (d) which reads: &#8220;Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group&#8221; by pushing interracial relationships and actually having the gall to insinuate that whites who refuse to engage in miscegenation are somehow &#8216;evil&rsquo; and &#8216;racist&rsquo; and thoroughly despicable people.    Clearly, this is an attempt to prevent white babies from being born.  Clearly, this is a deliberate effort to interfere with, and meddle in, the reproductive choices of a specific national, ethnical, racial or religious group of people - namely, white people of European descent.  </p>
<p>So, to summarize this issue.  Yes, there is a conspiracy afoot - and yes, General Lee does make a very valid point with regards to his comments in favor of abortion being available for ethnic groups who have a miserable track record in the area of self-sufficiency; nobody has a right to bring children into this world and expect other&rsquo;s to shoulder their financial responsibilities for raising and caring for that child.    But, the real point here is that there is a conspiracy to genocide people of European descent and we are clearly one of the most productive and talented races of humans on the planet.  And, this is the reason we are in the cross-hairs; we make lousy slaves, and we pose a competitive threat to the globalist, New World Order, One World Totalitarian Government crowd of elite psychopaths who prefer to have docile and obedient servants.</p>
<p>However, I have a strong hunch that these evil psychopaths are not going to get their wish - because whites are waking up all over the planet.</p>

Ryan Bomberger, whose white mother was raped by a black man, grows up to love black people and despise white people.  Anybody see the pattern here?

<p>How many white babies have been aborted since then? Where are the figures on this???  Even if blacks weren&rsquo;t having the high number of abortions that they are, blacks couldn&rsquo;t take over anything.  They would still lose a number of their young men to gang violence, STDs and other disease that blacks are more prone to get than whites.  The whites always do better than them, regardless of whose the majority and/or whose in control.  This isn&rsquo;t meant to be hateful. It&rsquo;s simple a matter of fact.</p>

		<p>When I worked at a crisis pregnancy center, I thought that for many women one more birth or one more abortion wouldn&rsquo;t really change the course of their lives.  You could almost flip a coin.  These women were of the multi-generation welfare, dysfunctional class, mostly black but some white. </p>
<p>For the more middle-class and capable women, it would make a difference, as there was not likely to be a whole series of unplanned pregnancies.  There were some black and some white women in this category.</p>
<p>Not every baby aborted results in a net population loss measured over time, as very frequently there is a replacement baby within a year, who wouldn&rsquo;t have been born without the first baby dying.  And not every baby born results in a net population gain, as the mother may be less likely to conceive a next child so that she can care for the first.</p>
<p>The availability of abortion greatly increases loose sexual behavior in women and frees men from notions of responsibility.  If abortion were hard to come by, people would tend to conduct themselves more carefully whatever their race.  Abortion, like welfare, has contributed greatly to the destruction of the family, with black families being affected first - but white families are now where black families were forty years ago.</p>

		<p>I am pro-life, no exceptions.</p>
<p>But I do see the dilemma here.  As I said in another thread, I am against killing someone who hasn&rsquo;t committed any crime.  This includes children born of rape  &mdash;  abortion only adds to the trauma of the rape, it doesn&rsquo;t erase it.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, and thinking about people who say that blacks have more abortions than whites, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that &#8220;there&rsquo;s more where they came from.&#8221;  Instead of ten children, a black woman might let seven live, while whites still have fewer children.</p>
<p>And I like what Bill said:  &#8220;As a fundamental Christian, I see a solution that not only makes sense, but allows me to meet BOTH my desires. Make abortion illegal. Think about it. Whites, being law abiding generally, will begin repopulating. BLACKS, who never care about laws and engage in illegal activity routinely and without thought or guilty consciences, WILL continue to get abortions. Our population goes up, theirs goes down. Win win in my book. And the blacks will be responsible for their own demise with no excuse blaming Whites, while MY conscience is clear also.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too am a Christian.  </p>
<p>I do disagree on one point  &mdash;  they&rsquo;ll still blame whitey.  Personal responsibility is a foreign concept to them.</p>

		<p>I can understand why someone might have had an abortion, or gotten somebody pregnant, or become a teenage parent on welfare because anyone can make a mistake. I do think that they are worthy of my compassion once.  My compassion is not anywhere that it can be found by someone who just does not care enough to even try to behave in a responsible manner.  I am in favor of the State sterilizing those who persist in idiotic conduct when even the stupidest ones should have learned from their experience to know better.</p>

		<p>For the record I am pro-abortion rights, mainly because women who terminate pregnancies tend to be young, unmarried, poor and undereducated. And not surprisingly, black females who become pregnant are more likey to fit that desciption than white females. Conservatives love to say they&rsquo;re all for &#8220;limiited government,&#8221; but why are they alright with babies being born to women who will most centainly become dependants of the state?  </p>
<p>As for the article&rsquo;s suggestion that if abortion had not been legalized blacks would be 19% of the population, do they take into account that some black fetuses would still have been aborted (illegally) in the ensuing years? And What if the expansion of welfare in the 60s hadn&rsquo;t occured, how many blacks would have had fewer kids as a result?  And would the US black population really be &#8220;59 million strong&#8221; if the immigration act of 1965 had not been implemented, since many blacks have been added here as a result of it?  </p>

		<p>Anti-abortionists who desire more black births are either ignorant of basic demographics or desirous of accelerating demographic changes to the detriment of whites that are already in progress.   White women in America have a fertility rate of 1.8, below the 2.1 necessary to sustain a population.  Fertility in Europe has plummeted to 1.5.  Meanwhile, fertility among blacks in every country in the world is above that of whites.  <br>

		<p>I was in an all white rural community the other day and saw two abortion clinics and an army recruiting station on the same block! Who do you really think is targeted for extinction?</p>

		<p>Since this was brought up, I&rsquo;ll have to weigh in and say that banning abortion even in the case of rape will probably not pass legal muster.  It has already been ruled under international humanitarian law that enforced pregnancy via rape is a violation of the human rights of the woman or women involved.  The UN tribunal that covered the Bosnian war crimes made this very clear.</p>
