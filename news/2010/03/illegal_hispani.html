			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter Rodgers, Christian Science Monitor, March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>US Census statistics suggest [that a] quarter of all Americans will probably be Latino in 40 years.</p>
<p>This trend has worrisome aspects. Imagine a huge, growing Hispanic underclass in America with a grudge, a burning sense of having been victimized by the &#8220;gringos.&#8221;</p>
<p>I witnessed this grudge up close a few years ago at Texas A&M; International University in Laredo. Hispanic students challenged me, claiming any restriction of illegal immigration across the US southern border with Mexico is a violation of Latinos&rsquo; human rights.</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Would you try to reenter Spain without a passport?</p>
<p>Students: &#8220;Of course not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;What about France, or Britain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Students: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet many of these illegal Latino immigrants suffer the illusion they are divinely entitled to colonize the US  &mdash;  and not just the states bordering Mexico, but Chicago and the East Coast as well.</p>
<p>Some Hispanics talk openly of a reconquista, an effort to reclaim the American Southwest that once belonged to Mexico.</p>
<p>Historically, this concept is wide of the mark. Most Hispanic ancestors of immigrants owned no land. Their forebears were serfs of the Roman Catholic Church, once the largest landholder in Latin America and the world. Other ancestors labored as landless peons for Spanish colonial landlords who were later relieved of their lands by 19th-century Anglo-Americans.</p>
<p>Historical entitlement is but one of the myths surrounding illegal Hispanic immigration. {snip}</p>
<p>Professor Lawrence Harrison of Tufts University in Medford, Mass., notes that &#8220;In California, fourth- and fifth-generation Mexican immigrants are still speaking only Spanish and resisting assimilation.&#8221; He says there are serious cultural barriers to the old melting-pot concept. &#8220;Words like compromise and dissent, crucial concepts to American democracy, have radically different meanings in Spanish.&#8221; Dissent, for example, translates into &#8220;heresy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most alarming, today&rsquo;s influx of poor Latin American immigrants comes from countries less than congenial to democracy, a law-based society, or public education. Many experts look with alarm on the fact that, unlike earlier European and Asian immigrants, the tsunami from the south too often undervalues educating children because many Hispanic parents resent the idea that their children will have more education than they have. In 2000, only 25 percent of working-age male Mexican immigrants had graduated high school, a sad fact that contributes to an increasingly volatile underclass.</p>
<p>Limited legal Latino immigration greatly enriches the United States. {snip}</p>
<p>But it is morally shameful to expect taxpayers to fund free education and medical care for lawbreakers so that the wealthiest Americans  &mdash;  restaurant owners, ranchers, agribusiness owners, and construction companies  &mdash;  can hire cheap labor regardless of the national consequences.</p>
<p>It is ever the wealthy sticking it to the poor. With so many Americans losing their homes and unable to find jobs, it is outrageous to say Hispanics still take jobs no one else will do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Businessmen are bonkers if they think opening US borders to allow the free flow of uneducated labor will make America competitive with a burgeoning Chinese economy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Committing national suicide is not without precedent. The Dutch are rapidly losing their country. Before long, its largest cities will belong to Muslim immigrants. What then becomes of the liberal tradition of Erasmus and traditional Dutch tolerance?</p>
<p>Illegal immigration may ultimately be more threatening to the character and values of the US than any threat from radical Islamists. It&rsquo;s not about tribe; it&rsquo;s about the law.<br>

<p>I almost had an accident in my pants, because I was laughing so hard at that sentence.</p>
<p>Now what might these fools be discussing in this article? Is it simply, &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; arrogant vulgarity; is it simply, American stupidity and cultural myths that no longer work; or is it simply, something larger than that, perhaps, an amorphous combination of the two?</p>
<p>Might it not be this &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; thing, we have come to call, multiculturalism?</p>
<p>The gropings of this fool Walter Rodgers and his quoted cohorts spew in this article, certainly indicates that they miss these questions. Take for example, this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illegal immigration may ultimately be more threatening to the character and values of the US than any threat from radical Islamists. It&rsquo;s not about tribe; it&rsquo;s about the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, do you think a &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; or assimilated multiculturalism might work in your neighborhood, Mr. Rodgers? Would it be ok, if we had tribes that &ldquo;respected&rdquo; the &ldquo;law&rdquo; in such a fanciful &ldquo;community?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxO1o6y5ahI&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxO1o6y5ahI&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>Get over it!</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and the associated belief that nonwhites are just like us, within a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; framework of constitutional protections, is a joke. Simply because, multiculturalism holds no law above &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; being a tool to &ldquo;assimilate&rdquo; whites into a diversity auto-genocide of globalism; and nonwhites are all too happy to oblige this process, both &ldquo;legally&rdquo; or otherwise.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>The author somewhat misses the point. <i>Legal</i> Latino immigration dilutes American culture and values, not just illegal Latino immigration.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that our government deported every single illegal alien from Latin America tomorrow and built a wall across our southern border. Legal immigration from Latin America will still eventually make us into minorities in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time our government stop the open borders policy with the Third World and adopt a sane immigration policy.</p>

Even after getting it somewhat right, the author can&rsquo;t bring himself to admit that Americans are a people, yes, a tribe in his words.  When Obama declares it&rsquo;s legal for the mestizo hoards to colonize the USA will our values be any less threatened?</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, but I was under the impression that most of the Spanish southwest was barely populated by Mexicans in the years before the Mexican War. I&rsquo;m fairly certain that by 1846 Whites far outnumbered Mestizos north of the Rio Grande. Again if I am not wildly exaggerating, that Mexican settlers shied away from the this region because of the fierce native inhabitants. Whites had been moving into the old Spanish territories from the 1820s. </p>
<p>Another issue. If the territory north of the Rio Grande belonged to Spain prior to 1824, who could claim it once the Spanish empire melted away? </p>

		<p>  The author, Walter Rodgers, did well until the last paragraph.<br>
  Illegal immigration is about tribes and ethinicity-Indians and Mestizos taking from the whites and then from the blacks and others. This has been published in Spanish many times by the organized groups.<br>
  No we cannot all get along. Indians hate and resent white civilization, they hate people with more education or wealth.<br>
Many tribes have lived in communal societies and had cultures very similar to communism. The other tribes believe that tribal members should have everything and people outside &#8220;la raza&#8221; should have &#8220;nada&#8221; nothing. Liberals cannot think this through because they want to feel good about helping the poor natives but the natives take but do not want to change. Why change if whites are stupid enough to give ?<br>
   For those Americans who understand Spanish not to have told other Americans what is said daily on some Hispanic radio stations in the US looks to many Hispanicos like suicide wish.<br>
   If you can understand, then listen, you will be shocked at what you hear.<br>
   Destroy the gringos-Take their land-force the whites out of the US- Send them back to Europe -or worse a often heard.<br>
   Listen for a week then respond to me.<br>
   Alverez was my mother&rsquo;s name but there are no non-white ancestors.  We are for the same society as you.We came with Florida when the US acquired Florida. <br>
   The Indians and Mestizos called Hispanics today hate people like me far more than they hate you. I understand and might cause you to understand that Mexicans and others, called Hispanics do want to take everything you have and change your country.<br>

McCain and Graham will not rest until they get amnesty passed!<br>
However, McCain is keeping his mouth shut because he&rsquo;s up for reelection.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham is working behind the scenes to help Democrats craft a new version of former President Bush&rsquo;s immigration reform bill. Graham also supported the Bush/Kennedy/McCain bill back in 2007.<br>
A spokesman for Mr. Graham, McCain&rsquo;s best buddy, said in a statement that &ldquo;Senator Graham is ready and willing to play a key role in immigration reform. He intends to work with many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle.&rdquo;<br>
The new amnesty bill will most likely be introduced soon by Sen. Charles Schumer and Sen. Graham has been working with his colleague in search of other Republican.  The only good news is that Sen McCain, another supporter, will be going down in flames in his reelection bid because he continues to completely ignore the Arizona people who are sick of being overrun by illegals. This is especially true now because of the recent murder of a very well known rancher on the border by illegals. Obama is out to destroy America with amnesty and other outrageous policies and is being aided and abetted by the likes of Graham and McCain. <br>

		<p>I must say that for such a piece to appear in any media outlet is refreshing.  The author tried to be nice but you could see his concern peaking through the clouds.</p>
<p>He saw the future, and he saw it wasn&rsquo;t us, but them.  The Dutch thing he mentioned was also fascinating in a brief way.  When the cities of Europe are white no more, what will the libs there do?  Try to integrate the Arabs and African blacks?  They hate each other and won&rsquo;t listen to some outmoded lib ideas from the minority whites.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve long dealt with Latinos, and lived in Latin America. They&rsquo;re a better people  &mdash;  as a group  &mdash;  than blacks, certainly more sociable and cooperative though probably not a whole lot more intelligent.</p>
<p>They will do as much as they think they can get away with, and no more. It seems to be coded in their genes that rules are for fools, and made to be broken. They feel that anyone who tries to enforce rules is picking on them or being paid to harass them.</p>
<p>There are few things in this world dumber than a politicized Latino. They can spout slogans, but they can&rsquo;t think abstractly. When they do organize politically, they are very easily manipulated by the least scrupulous interests.</p>
<p>Ultimately, keeping them in line is a much simpler matter than dealing with blacks. All it takes is a massive show of force. They crumble and fall away as soon as it&rsquo;s made clear to them that whitey means business. Often it&rsquo;s just as effective to find a few key leaders and lock them up or publicly humiliate them. Unlike blacks, Latinos seem to have the ability to sense a cause is lost when faced down by authority with a backbone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually not terrible people on the whole, just limited in the kind of rational intelligence it takes to run a modern society. They seem to understand this intuitively better than blacks do, and carry quite an inferiority complex that they mask with &#8220;macho&#8221; behavior.</p>
<p>I wish more Americans understood Latinos, and knew how to deal with them effectively. They genuinely don&rsquo;t understand why any white person would try to be reasonable with them, and take it as a mealy-mouthed sign of weakness.</p>

<b>Border Invasion Pics site:</b></p>
<p><i>A massive number of people illegally enter the USA every day by simply walking unchallenged across our southern border. In the 1952 miles of border from California to Texas they use literally thousands of trails and paths, ever changing their routes to avoid detection. Cartel involvement has brought increased organizational skills to smuggling operations and, contrary to government claims, only a very small percentage are apprehended. Accurate statistics are impossible to gather, but <b>the true numbers are staggering, and the general public remains largely uninformed.</b></i></p>

		<p>I have long felt that our Rulers are trying to bring the country down slowly, extracting every bit they can before the golden goose dies, and equally important, avoiding any White mass reaction that might upset their plans.  Perhaps this writer fears that things are going bad too quickly, and is advocating a slowdown?  The fact is, there can be no compromise with an unassimilable minority.  It really is an Us or Them choice.  Are we going to support them, and gradually sink to their level, or will we cast them off to care for themselves?  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since I&rsquo;ve read so much truth packed in to so few words.  I am still new to &#8220;race realism,&#8221; so I recoiled a bit when I read your statements.  I, too, have quite a bit of experience with both blacks and Latinos, and I agree with your brutally honest assessment.  I actually like living with Mexicans, but you do have to understand that they simply do not believe in the rule of law.  As you note, however, they will not fundamentally undermine or destroy any system that they understand they are dependent on.  It is a different story with blacks.</p>

		<p>At the height of its population under Mexican rule, the Southwest was populated by roughly 5,000 persons. Most of the territory was vacant. Following the Mexican War, the USA purchased the region from Mexico under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildalgo. Moreover, the Mexican government sold more territory to the USA at the time of the Gadsen Purchase. </p>
<p>These are facts that &#8220;reconquista&#8221; activists NEVER acknowledge. </p>

		<p>The author mentions the long history of Latin American Amerindians working as serfs/tenants for white landowners such as the Conquistadores and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>True enough, but while leftists try to spin this as evidence of &#8220;racism&#8221; and white privilege the reality is that the Indians often weren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to run their own farms themselves and were better off working for the Spaniards.  <br>

It&rsquo;s a good start. As the tag line noted, someone in the MSM has taken notice of the obvious; that Hispanics have their sites set on America and are using the &#8216;historic grievance&rsquo; argument to push their agenda and silence critics.</p>
<p>Unlike American-Africans, Hispanics weren&rsquo;t brought here against their will or by force. How can you come here of your own volition and claim historic victimization?</p>
<p>I believe this began with the broadening of the term minority during the civil rights movement. Originally, minority was a code word for blacks. Over time, other groups realized they could co-opt the word for themselves and claim their own &#8216;historic grievances&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It should have been nipped in the bud at the start but the courts broadened the usage and minority now applies to anyone who claims that title.</p>
<p>Blacks of course are on the losing end as always. Since they allowed this to happen, minority now includes everyone including blacks. While blacks could have held exclusive use of the word, by giving it away, they have assured that instead of getting all the jobs, they&rsquo;re only a minority among minorities.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that one through.</p>

<p>They are only doing what the American government allows them to do.</p>
<p>They are tools of a concerted effort to dispossess Native Born American Whites and make them a minority in the United States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working, as planned.</p>
<p>Hispanics are neither intelligent enough to understand how they are being used nor organized enough to dispossess Whites unless the government had its jackboot on our White necks, which it does  &mdash;  threatening us with Hate Crimes, Hate Speech, loss of job, wealth, land and worse  &mdash;  favoring hispanic rights over Whites, the slave class they&rsquo;re importing, using them to do the job of vilifying us and displacing us in our own homelands. </p>

This was my focus as a graduate student in American history (before I had any such views as I do now:<br>
Indeed, after stacks and stacks-literally hundreds of first hand accounts of the era from American settlers, soldiers, politicians, and many Mexicans, I can easily say that The US southwest(as it is marked today) was very thinly populated by  Mexicans, Spaniards and others who wanted to get the hell away from Mexico, which was in fact a state  only, and not a nation. Mexico in the early and mid 1800s was a place on a map. Mexico city was the state. What existed far to the north was a vast, underpopupated stretch of land with a few outposts of mexican govt. officials, residing in a land with no real authority, in a place that was demarcated by previous proclamations by Spain. The present US southwest never did belong to Mestizos. The claim of reconquistas is as valid as a claim that the USA sent probes to Mars, therefore we own it.<br>
But reconquistas are an ignorant, chauvanistic band of mestizo ruffians,and unfortunately, they already won, as whites have become effete losers incapable of self preservation.</p>

		<p>WOW! Let me catch my breath. This is the sharpest retort to PC mendacity I have read from a major MSM source. If the upcoming congressional elections show white anger has reached a boil, maybe more bien-pensants will be emboldened to offemd leftist dogma by wielding some good old fashioned stigmas.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really very simple&hellip;</p>
<p>The illegals know that the border is very big, very sparsely patrolled, and therefore very porous.</p>
<p>They know that they won&rsquo;t get shot and killed while trying to cross it,</p>
<p>They know that if they get over the border, they can get pretty much the same rights as a US citizen.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t they try to cross it? Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? What&rsquo;s stopping them??</p>
<p>The only way this is ever going to end is if they are fired upon with lethal force. But that&rsquo;s never going to happen. So forget it, the battle is lost, America has changed forever and there is no going back.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This trend has worrisome aspects. Imagine a huge, growing Hispanic underclass in America with a grudge, a burning sense of having been victimized by the &#8216;gringos.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Imagine it?  I could just as easily drive a mile into the Hispanic part of town and open my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet many of these illegal Latino immigrants suffer the illusion they are divinely entitled to colonize the US &mdash; and not just the states bordering Mexico, but Chicago and the East Coast as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  While this is true, in reality it&rsquo;s not land but white prosperity that they covet.  We could return the American Southwest to them tomorrow, and they would still be sneaking across our border for our wages and public benefits under some new made-up entitlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Lawrence Harrison of Tufts University in Medford, Mass., notes that &#8216;In California, fourth- and fifth-generation Mexican immigrants are still speaking only Spanish and resisting assimilation.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m fine with this.  True assimilation of non-whites is a pipe-dream anyway.  Better to leave the multicults with less fodder to justify shoving more diversity down our throats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most alarming, today&rsquo;s influx of poor Latin American immigrants comes from countries less than congenial to democracy, a law-based society, or public education&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Different races have different ideas about form of government?  Imagine that. </p>
<p>&#8220;Limited legal Latino immigration greatly enriches the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Assuming the &#8220;limited legal Latino immigration&#8221; is composed primarily of the caucasion actresses I see appearing in big budget mexican films and mexican soap operas, perhaps there is some truth to this, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Committing national suicide is not without precedent. The Dutch are rapidly losing their country. Before long, its largest cities will belong to Muslim immigrants. What then becomes of the liberal tradition of Erasmus and traditional Dutch tolerance?&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  It will be much easier for the Dutch to &#8220;tolerate&#8221; Muslims when Muslims have taken control the country  &mdash;  they&rsquo;ll have no choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration may ultimately be more threatening to the character and values of the US than any threat from radical Islamists. It&rsquo;s not about tribe; it&rsquo;s about the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  You&rsquo;ve got that one backward, Ace.  The law should serve our needs, not the other way around.  Nonwhite-immigration, whether legal or illegal, is harming our country.  I think most whites intuitively get this, but still feel they have too much to lose to really do anything about it.  I have a feeling this won&rsquo;t be the case for much longer.    </p>

		<p>Samuel Huntington made many similar points in his excellent book &#8220;Who Are We?&#8221;  Huntington explains why Mexican immigration is so much more dangerous to America than immigration from other regions.  When your native country is right next door, psychological attachments to the old country remain strong and assimilation goes out the window.</p>

Your description of Latin culture matches mine exactly.<br>
In their own countries latinos are likeable people..humble, courteous, but  this all changes within a 2 years of arrival in the USA<br>
The humble Mexican peasant becomes the Chicano Gang Banger in short order. The same herd/group mentality of the campesino translates into the herd/group mentality of the gang member.<br>
Gangs are inevitable in Hispanic culture they provide a buffer and a  way of belonging in an advanced technological world that they cannot understand in the slightest. The ignorance and passivity of Latino culture makes them very suspect about white motives, and the massive inferiority complex never goes away. Acts of white generosity are looked on as gullibility to be exploited. Most white liberals never catch on to whats happening, and they keep pumping more money and effort into an attempted relationship, failing to see how different the Latinos perspective really is.</p>

		<p>I want to remind AmRen readers that the term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; officially refers to anyone from a Spanish-speaking country from the New World.  But, in fact, what everyone really means by the label &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is Amerindians and mestizos (mixed New World Indians and other races).  The official and real use of the word differs, because a variety of races live in Central and South America – i.e., there are full-blooded Europeans, Africans, Arabs, Chinese, Japanese, etc. living throughout &ldquo;Latin America.&rdquo;  Hence, a German or Japanese immigrant to Argentina can come to America and not only be counted as a &ldquo;Hispanic,&rdquo; but will be eligible for Minority scholarships, affirmative action, etc.  I&rsquo;ve actually seen 100% Whites from Spain participate in &ldquo;Minority&rdquo; programs in the USA.  – i.e., your tax money that was assigned to a &ldquo;Minority up-lift Program&rdquo; was given to a White (European) Spaniard. </p>
<p>Note the dishonesty here:  We designate Whites, Blacks, and Asians based on genes (race), but &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; based on culture.  What&rsquo;s going on?  Why do politicians do this?  </p>
<p>The bottom line is that, in reality, most &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; who enter the USA are full- or partial-blood New World Indians   &mdash;   The same race of people as the Aztecs who built a society around human sacrifice.  I&rsquo;ve lived my life around &#8220;Hispanics.&#8221; By and large, they are nice enough on a one-to-one basis, and they work hard, when necessary.  However, most are really dumb and have little motivation, beyond immediate needs, they have difficulty graduating from high school, are prone to drugs and small-time crime, and breed at a young age and at a very high rate.  They will out-breed nearly all other races.<br>

		<p>Diversity is our Strength is as great and absurd a falsehood as the &#8220;Work Shall Set You Free&#8221; greeting that met new arrivals at the Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>Racial and cultural diversity is never, not ever, a source of strength, progress, and national commitment.  Though there a few limited examples of racially diverse societies (Hong Kong and Singapore come to mind), cultural diversity is a direct contradiction in terms.  A society, by definition, shares a common culture, a common language, and a set of common moral standards and ethics.  The Euro-ethnic founders and still majority inhabitants of North America share none of these cultural characteristics with the hordes of Hispanics now inhabiting huge tracts within our nation.</p>
<p>To survive we must either expel them (violently if need be) or force them to assimilate on our terms.  And we must, right now, stop any further immigration from Latin America.  </p>

		<p>At the time of the Texas War of Independence, Texas was 7/8 White.  The Mexican peons had fled from the Commanches, and the Mexican government had invited Americans in to populate the area and hold back the Indians.  This immigration policy was hotly debated by the Mexican legislature in the 1820s, but passed.  Given the fact that the Mexicans were being driven out by Commanches and the Mexican Army hadn&rsquo;t the power to protect its people, maybe letting a few Indian fighters from Tennessee seemed like a good idea.  <br>
     California had about 7000 people in 1846, according to the Mexican records.  A little more than half were Mexicans, the rest a mix of Americans and Europeans.  The Mexican landowning class had welcomed the Whites as social equals, and gave some of them big ranchos, and allowed their daughters to marry them.   The Mexican elites knew that their own people could not develop the economy, and so tried to bring capable Whites into their own culture.   <br>
     Only New Mexico had a solid Spanish presence, at Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and many of the old families from that area still regard themselves as Spanish, not Mexican.  <br>
     Mexico&rsquo;s holds on these territories were all very weak.  They were really just the furthest fringes of the old Spanish Imperial claims.  They were thinly populated, so thin that the Mexican government allowed Americans to move in simply to occupy land.  In the 1830s, the Mexicans were more afraid of the British or the Russians seizing California than of the Americans.  People also forget that the Louisiana Territory was seized by France from Spain before they sold it to the U.S.  These land claims were nothing but lines on maps in distant capitals.  Boots on the ground are all that ever really mattered.  Claims that the Southwest legally belongs to Mexico have all the moral weight of 18th century royal diplomacy.  </p>

<p>What is needed ia a complete shut down of all nonwhite immigration to 0&hellip;permanently. </p>
<p>I am of Irish ancestry my ancestors come from the same  county as Nick Griffin&rsquo;s Irish ancestors..ancestors had the same last name&hellip; way further back, German ancestry. However, I am opposed to any Irish LEGAL IMMIGRATION. The Irish illegals who were legailzed in the 1980s and 1990s are not allies of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS. They are in a political coalition with nonwhites for an open borders immigration policy. Keep the Irish out..they would be forced to deal head on with their race-replacement in Ireland. I would keep all English immigrants out also for the same reason.</p>
<p>To reverse race-replacement,illegal aliens must be kicked out&hellip;after the asian and muslim fifth column in OUR AMERICA. </p>
<p>If a majority of NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS openly expressed hostility at  their race-replacement at the hands  of hispanics, asians and muslims&hellip;many of them would self-deport. </p>
<p>The situation can be reversed..if there is a will there is a way.</p>

		<p>Wait   &mdash;   it gets worse!  Take identical-twin American Indians standing on different sides of our southern border.  The one standing in the USA is &#8220;Native American,&#8221; and is eligible for governemnt handouts.  The one standing on the Mexican side of the border is &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; and is eligible for government handouts if he steps over the border.</p>
<p>Now take two identical-twins born in Sweden.  One immigrates to Mexico and the other immigrates to the USA.  The former (if he walks into the USA) is considered a poor oppressed &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; who deserves government funding, just like the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; American Indian, above.  The latter (his Swedish twin-brother) is considered a &#8220;racist white&#8221; former slave holder, who unfailrly enjoys &#8220;White privlege&#8221; and has been keeping People of Color down, and whose taxes will be taken and given to his twin-brother who just stepped across the border into the USA.  </p>
