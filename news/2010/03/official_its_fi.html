			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Harker, Guardian (London), March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>BNP&rsquo;s march into the mainstream moves forward. Fresh from their top-table seat on the BBC&rsquo;s Question Time (which marked International Women&rsquo;s Day with an all-female audience; it marked last year&rsquo;s Black History Month with an invite to Nick Griffin), party members have now been told that it&rsquo;s OK for them to teach our children.</p>
<p>In a review which will shock many members of the teaching profession, not to mention ethnic-minority parents, Maurice Smith, former chief inspector of schools, concludes: &#8220;I do not believe that barring teachers or other members of the wider school workforce from membership of legitimate [sic] organisations which may promote racism is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reaches his decision because, in the last seven years, only four teachers, and two governors, have been found to be BNP members, and only nine incidents of teachers making racist remarks or holding racist materials have been uncovered. Banning BNP members would, he says, therefore be a &#8220;taking a very large sledgehammer to crack a minuscule nut&#8221;.</p>
<p>Two things here are breathtaking: one is that a man who held such a senior position in the running of Britain&rsquo;s schools has such a one-dimensional and uninformed view of the issue of racism in our education system. Is he not aware of the underachievement statistics for many of Britain&rsquo;s racial minorities, widely believed to be party fuelled by low teacher expectations? Is he not aware of the massive rates of exclusions and disciplinary procedures against black boys?</p>
<p>Does he really believe that racism is all about making offensive remarks, rather than promoting, openly or covertly, a system of inequality and injustice? If that&rsquo;s the case, then, with people like him in charge, no wonder so little has been achieved in improving these statistics over the years.</p>
<p>He lists a number of bureaucratic &#8220;safeguards&#8221; to prevent racism in schools, but this is utterly unconvincing. Schools equal-opportunity policies are notoriously ineffective in making real differences, merely satisfying the box-ticking mentality which pervades the education system. And the &#8220;duty to promote social cohesion&#8221; is equality easy to subvert, the term often being used as a cover for anti-Muslim propaganda.</p>
<p>The second shocking development here is that his recommendations were immediately accepted in full by the schools secretary, Ed Balls.</p>
<p>Actually, given that all three parties are crawling over each other to win the votes of the &#8220;white working class&#8221;  &mdash;  whom they now subconsciously equate with racism and bigotry  &mdash;  it shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: the BNP is a racist party. It is anti-migrant and defines those of non-white racial origin as permanent second-class citizens, regardless of whether they were born here. It has been forced against its will to admit ethnic-minority members, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s suddenly become a party of race equality. In fact, the handful of minority members the party may attract will be fellow Muslim-hating extremists.</p>
<p>So when Ed Balls, in his reply to Smith, begins, &#8220;There is no place for racism in schools&#8221;, he shows himself to be a complete hypocrite by then going on to agree with BNP teachers.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s OK with the party in the classroom, then he should be honest at least and say: &#8220;Yes, there is a place for racism in schools.&#8221; And, to black and Asian families in particular: &#8220;Yes, parents, when you leave your five-year-old at the school gates, we don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re handing them over to someone who despises your race, despises your faith, and who wants to terrorise you and run you out of the country. As long as they don&rsquo;t say it so anyone can hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complacency, as the BNP gains council seats and could possibly even gain its first MP this year, is staggering.</p>
<p>It is often said that for evil to flourish, all it takes is for good people to do nothing. As the BNP&rsquo;s message of hate moves onwards, it is time for good people to take a stand.</p>

		<p>Britain truly is hopeless. It&rsquo;s bad enough that WE have Black History month when a 15 second commercial would cover the whole topic, but Britain? What did British blacks ever do, unless you count an imported striker on one of the Premier League teams?</p>

<p>They always turn this around. And the mainstream almost seem to reveal in having things backward. Perhaps BNP members should be the only ones Allowed to teach, if they are really concerned with racism. . Imply they are &#8216;bigots&rsquo; all you want. . but the reality is &#8216;working class whites&rsquo; have already been exposed to the racism of non-whites, and they don&rsquo;t want to experience more. What do to? Perhaps front another &#8216;punk&rsquo; band dedicated to the world-wide workers struggle? &#8216;Authenticity&rsquo; is like gold in times like these&hellip; </p>

		<p>Why not be thorough in rooting out all teachers with possible bias? What about teachers in poor district schools who don&rsquo;t want to live in the same neighborhood as the students do? There might be a problem with religious teachers who don&rsquo;t agree with students on homosexuality, abortion, or being of different faith. I can imagine foreign born teachers still having old country allegiances that conflict with allegiances of students. What about teachers who strive for high achievement being forced to deal with students of limited capability? </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Yes, parents, when you leave your five-year-old at the school gates, we don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re handing them over to someone who despises your race, despises your faith, and who wants to terrorise you and run you out of the country.

<p>That is EXACTLY what is happening right NOW in Canada, England and the US.  Except the racism and intolerance and violence is committed by the minorities attending the schools.  Moreover, the minority and liberal teachers have the gall to preach to the kids it&rsquo;s GOOD for them and there is something wrong with THEM if they object to the obvious hypocrisy they see, and the bias against them they experience.  </p>
<p>Typical liberal/black argumentative technique.  Accuse your enemies of what you yourself have been doing to MAKE them your enemies.  Or, accuse your ideological opponents of what you have been doing all along.  The previous poster had it right.  It&rsquo;s Orwellian.  And they know it.  Some of us read the book to become aware of what could happen to us.  Others read it and came away with a playbook of HOW to do it to us.</p>

		<p>And the BNP wants to keep non-whites out of Britain. Both sides should get their wish. The British isles would remain safely white, there would be no fear, or reality, of the indigenous population going extinct&hellip; and the people of Britain could rest safe knowing they are morally superior to everyone else, with the assurance they don&rsquo;t put up with types like the BNP. That would make things even. </p>

		<p>If we banned racists from public schools in the United States very few blacks would get hired.  Many of them are virulently anti-white.  If favoring discriminatory policies based on race makes you a racist, no Democrats or neocon Republicans could be hired.<br>

		<p>This is why I really have a lot of disdain for blacks.  They&rsquo;re are very emotional, childish, and hypocritical when it comes to blacks.  They move whereever whites are, tell whites what to do, that we have to give up power, that we have to include them, want to preserve their own race and then have to gall to accuse us of oppression and racism.  If you&rsquo;re black and in Britian, shut up.  It&rsquo;s historically and genetically the land of MY ancestors and my bloodline, and you have no say whatsover what goes on there.  </p>

		<p>If Harker would prefer that teachers dress like something out of Star Wars and appear in front of students in a head to toe black shroud with a full face mask it may assuage his BNP fears. Of course, whether or not the teacher is male or female, black or White, or even the actual teacher is another matter as no one would be able to tell but I don&rsquo;t believe that teachers who are members of the BNP take classes wearing a BNP rosette or even a pointy hat. A sneaky comment buried in his anti-White tirade against the BNP is &#8220;&hellip;in the last seven years&hellip;&hellip;only nine incidents of teachers making racist remarks or holding racist materials have been uncovered&hellip;. &#8221; but he does not clarify which race or religion these teachers are and what the remarks &amp; materials were. Harker always writes about &#8216;his&rsquo; race. Nothing escapes his black viewpoint, nothing. Not even trivia about greetings cards. Why does the Guardian employ him?? Because he&rsquo;s black, that&rsquo;s why. He used to write for black-only publications but maybe he could complain if only he had White Irish mother who had been racist and diluted the pure African blood-line.<br>

<p>There are others who write for the Guardian. Lola Adesioye has a weekly online column and she doesn&rsquo;t always agree with Harker about his views on downtrodden blacks being harassed and insulted by Whites making offensive remarks. Harker has yet to rebut this particular article and probably won&rsquo;t. He will file it under Mugabe, Zuma, Idi Amin and other leading lights of the black African race.</p>

<p>  British parents have been leaving their children to British public schools run by teachers and a system which despises the British people despises their faith and has always wanted to terrorise the British people to extinction both genetically and culturally. Did clowns like Harker care then? Mr. Harker, you are a foreigner and as Great Britain is a sieving nation, you have no right to comment about what the British people should or should not do. No sensible nation would allow a foreigner (more so a foreigner who hates the people of that nation) to dictate about what the patriots of that nation can or cannot do. If Britain is so racist and bad, please leave.</p>

		<p>Joseph Harker if there&rsquo;s no place in education for &#8220;racism&#8221;, then your anti-White diatribe disqualifies you from discussion. I can agree with you &#8220;that for evil to flourish, all it takes is for good people to do nothing&#8221;, but the BNP is doing something to combat an anti-White attitude like yours.</p>

 <br>
The truth is most of the real racist and hate crime incidents in Britain&rsquo;s schools these days are coming from Muslims and non whites against Whites; and here we&rsquo;re not talking about mere insults but attacks with killing tools like knives and hammers. Have a look at something we in Britain call The &#8220;Enrichment News.&#8221;  Though you will not find this magazine being sold next to your Guardian in the local shops. It&rsquo;s avaialble only  online and through Google. The UK Enrichment News Keeping you informed of the benefits of multiculturalism. Thursday, February 18, 2010. Another Asian &ldquo;Pack Attack&rdquo; &hellip;<br>
