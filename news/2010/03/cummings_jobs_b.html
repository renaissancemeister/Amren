			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Zimmermann, The Hill, March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The jobs bill on its way to the president&rsquo;s desk will not help the black community, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said today.</p>
<p>The $18 billion legislation, which the Senate passed this morning, consists mainly of tax breaks for small businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem in the African-American community I don&rsquo;t think will be helped a lot by that bill,&#8221; Cummings, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told MSNBC&rsquo;s Andrea Mitchell.</p>
<p>The Maryland Democrat said that while he supports the tax credits, the Black Caucus will also be pushing for legislation sponsored by Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, that focuses on impoverished communities and helps retrain workers.</p>

		<p>There ARE black business owners who will benefit   &mdash;   but alas, the vast majority of blacks, who live in ghettos, want something a bit more direct than tax breaks.  They want cash windfalls.  They want their new &#8220;massa&#8221; to just hand them money for free.  Is this something new?  Nope.  Same old hands-out for &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; as it always has been.  Hopefully SOME DAY (my prince will come) - ghetto blacks will &#8220;get&#8221; that refraining from sex while one is in their school years will allow them to obtain an education, which in turn makes it much more likely that they&rsquo;ll get a decent job/career.  THEN they&rsquo;ll be in a position to take care of themselves instead of demanding that the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t do it.</p>

		<p>I have news for Elijah Cummings:  It won&rsquo;t help the white community either.  It&rsquo;s just window dressing to allay anger over unemployment.  If an 18 gigabuck jobs bill creates three permanent jobs, we&rsquo;ll be lucky.</p>

		<p><i>&#8221; focuses on impoverished communities and helps retrain workers.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I have with me the March 17th, 2010 issue of The Challenger (a local black weekly in Buffalo).</p>
<p>PP. 11 has an editorial by a Darnell Jackson entitled, &#8220;Reflections: Why Do We Blame Our Children?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson runs a job training program and this is what he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;We recently completed a job readiness program that ran 12 weeks. Twenty youths signed up and I was relatively successful (sic). But after the first three weeks many of them disappeared from the program and none of their parents ever bothered to make them follow up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Local black leaders report similar incidents on other job training programs for blacks in Buffalo. 20 show up and if they&rsquo;re lucky, 2 or 3 might complete the program. </p>
<p>I supervise black workers and I can tell you, within a week of being hired, the call-offs and no-shows begin.</p>
<p>I often ask myself why do these people even bother getting a job if they aren&rsquo;t willing to commit to it? </p>
<p>You know when you hire a black worker that the clock starts ticking.<br>

		<p>Well, this is a valid enough observation.  Tax breaks benefit only those who pay taxes, which exludes many, and perhaps most, blacks.</p>

		<p>A jobs bill that does not involve sending every H-1b visa holder home immediately is worthless; not even window-dressing.</p>

		<p>I agree totally with SBuffalonative.  I had the dubious pleasure of supervising blacks when I worked in the construction industry.</p>
<p>True, there were some lazy and good-for-nothing white kids, but the blacks always won hands down.  Now as a full-time student at a college in the South, I see the same phenomenon.  Too many of the blacks here think they will get something for nothing: just show up at classes and a good grade will magically appear. As usual. blacks cause an overwhelming majority of their problems, but they won&rsquo;t acknowledge that fact. </p>

		<p>To #6:  My grandfather told me the same thing with blacks in WWII.  I&rsquo;ve had friends who are my age, served in the military and with blacks, too&hellip;.and all said the same thing.  My grandfather grew up around only whites, had only contact with whites, and then had to work with blacks in WWII.  He had no preconceived notions bout blacks either.</p>

<p>Since the &#8220;problem&#8221; in the black community amounts to several, including low I.Q.&rsquo;s, incompetence, lack of ambition, little creativity, and almost no desire to try to improve one&rsquo;s self for employment, no kind of legislation CAN help them.  Laws are strictly guidelines and crutches, not magic wands.</p>
<p>Blacks are beset with some kind of delusion that giving them piles of money will solve their problems.  The basis of all these problems, however, is the fact they can&rsquo;t seem to understand what their problems are.  Consequently, Western societies are going to be burdened with their tumultuous black populations forever.  It&rsquo;s really like having to care for children who can&rsquo;t care for themselves. </p>
