			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Froomkin, Huffington Post, March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State laws that ban convicted felons from voting are having the unintentional (or is it intentional?) effect of disenfranchising one in eight African-American men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But in many states, convicted felons can&rsquo;t vote even after they&rsquo;ve re-entered society. And because of the disproportionate number of black men convicted of felonies, the effect on that population has been tremendously magnified.</p>
<p>An estimated 5.3 million Americans are denied the right to vote based on their felony convictions, 4 million of whom are out of prison. About a third of them are black, including 13 percent of all African-American men.</p>
<p>Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are proposing to change that. H.R. 3335, the Democracy Restoration Act, would bar states from disenfranchising felons from federal elections after they&rsquo;ve been released from prison. {snip}</p>
<p>At a subcommittee hearing Tuesday, Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau, called the matter &#8220;a question of rehabilitation, democracy and fairness.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>NYU Law School Professor Burt Neuborne argued that &#8220;most felony disenfranchisement statutes have their genesis in an effort to disenfranchise racial minorities&#8221; and that the &#8220;felony disenfranchisement laws of one kind or another&#8221; that &#8220;remain on the books of 48 of the 50 states&#8221; are &#8220;a morally repugnant link with a racist past.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two witnesses spoke in defense of the current system, including Hans von Spakovsky, whose claim to fame is his stint in the Bush Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division, where he turned the voting rights section&rsquo;s mission on its head  &mdash;  working to make it harder, not easier, for poor and minority voters to cast ballots. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Von Spakovsky said it was a matter of states&rsquo; rights. And he both mocked and questioned the motivations of the bill&rsquo;s sponsors:<blockquote>Why does this bill not also amend federal law to allow them to once again own a handgun? Are we to believe that they can be trusted to vote but not to own a handgun? Are we to believe that the sponsors of this legislation think that a convicted child molester can be trusted to vote but cannot be trusted to be a teacher in a public school? Are we to believe a convicted drug dealer can be trusted to vote but cannot be trusted to be a police officer? Or is the true motivation here based more on the fact that their vote is important to winning close elections?</blockquote><br>

<p>For most of them, they can register to vote once they&rsquo;re off probation.  It&rsquo;s that so many black ex-cons can&rsquo;t behave long enough to get off probation, that they can&rsquo;t vote.  So the NAACP is right, it is a question of rehabilitation.  Just that many blacks can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A caller to a Chicago radio station last summer argued that murder and other violent crimes shouldn&rsquo;t be felonies because too many black men wind up with felony sheets:</p>

		<p>Our founders limited the franchise to landowning males for one very important reason: the people who vote should have a stake in the countries success.  Universal suffrage is a terrible idea.  When you let welfare recipient&rsquo;s vote they have one main concern: getting freebies.   Do the feeble minded and illiterate vote based on reason and knowledge?  Probably not.  Wouldn&rsquo;t felons have a tendency to vote to reduce penalties on felons?  Probably yes.   But is that best for society as a whole?</p>
<p>We have cheapened the &ldquo;right to vote&rdquo; as much as we have cheapened citizenship.  Motor voter lets anyone vote without having to prove who they are or if they are eligible,  Why not let felons vote?  Does it make much difference at this point?  Illegals can vote.  The deceased can vote.  Why not felons?  Instead of setting up polling places in schools and senior centers we could locate them in jails and prisons.  The inmates could run the polls as well as vote without having to leave &ldquo;home&rdquo;.  The rest of us have to travel to vote, so why not drive to a jail instead of a school?</p>
<p>This is truly a states right issue from my point of view, but a little thing like the constitution rarely makes a difference to our politicians.<br>

		<p>One-third of them are Black??  That statistics seems a little low doesn&rsquo;t it?  What are they trying to say, that Blacks commit one-third of the crime, Hispanics, one-third, and Whites one-third??  Are they trying to even it out nicely for the sake of political correctness?  I&rsquo;ll wager than White crime is next to nothing, what with Hispanics and Middle-Easterners being counted as &#8220;White&#8221; in the crime statistics in many states.  This is what they don&rsquo;t want us to know.  </p>
<p>Go to www.cnn.com/justice RIGHT NOW AND READ THE STORIES THERE.  Mostly all White criminals.  Just read the story about the prisoner who had the gold teeth ripped from his mouth.  He&rsquo;s Black of course.  It&rsquo;s just incredible!!  Who do they think they&rsquo;re fooling with this constant demonization of Whites and uplifting of non-Whites?</p>

		<p>BULL.  The laws work for ANY race or gender committing felonies.  And rightfully so.<br>
Anybody who has committed a felony has given ample evidence he cares NOT about laws, and therefore should have NO say IN making those laws or electing folks who make the laws.  Whether or not they would lose their vote didn&rsquo;t even enter in their minds when they comitted their felonies, many of those felonies being violent ones.<br>
And they don&rsquo;t much care AFTER they serve their terms.  But then, this did come from the Huffington Post.  Folks who write and read that garbage have been doing exactly what the name implies.  They&rsquo;ve been &#8220;huffing&#8221; too long.  Those aerosols and chemicals WILL rot your brain ya know.</p>

		<p>A caller to a talk show I was listening to the other day said something that got through all the noise and hit me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reached the point where this country consists mostly of a vulnerable working class and an entitled class. The entitled class lives off the working class&rsquo;s taxes, even as they terrorize the latter. And those in power don&rsquo;t mind at all, because the entitled class is their new constituency.</p>
<p>As long as the flow of freebies continues unabated, the entitled class will continue to vote for those who promise to continue the unsustainable insanity. Convicted felons, being virtually unemployable, would figure to be prospective entitled class voters.</p>

		<p>I think voting should be based on a point system.  Your vote should gain points derived from such things as property ownership, taxes paid, employment, criminal record, etc.  </p>
<p>This will end the horrible system we have where a bum who flashes his junk at old ladies waiting for the bus can get out of the refrigerator box and cast a vote that carries the same weight as mine.</p>
<p>But then again, this would benefit the productive classes, and we can&rsquo;t have that now can we?  People might find in this an incentive to better themselves and become productive upstanding members of society, and this certainly wouldn&rsquo;t benefit the administrators of the nanny state. </p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t hold your breath. </p>

		<p>Those people disenfranchise themselves when the commit the crime. Plain, pure and simple. And whites too lose the vote. So what! And most of those folks that commit crimes and do so on a habitual basis WOULD NOT EVEN BOTHER TO VOTE IN THE FIRST PLACE! So what is all this concern for people that would NOT EVEN TO VOTE TO BEGIN WITH?</p>
<p>&#8220;BOTHER&#8221;! Yeah, that is what it is to most of those cons and felons. a &#8220;BOTHER&#8221;!</p>

<p>In a sane America blacks would be told to clean up their act. They would be informed that a felony conviction costs them the right to vote.</p>
<p>Instead the sensible law is being pilloried as &#8220;a morally repugnant link w/a racist past&#8221; by an NYU Law School Marxist. Whenever radio host Michael Savage wants to describe the most repellant people in our country he mentions NYU Law School alumni. </p>

		<p>The idea of disenfranchising convicted felons is all about &#8216;character&rsquo;, the argument being &#8216;why should a man convicted of a crime - often involving horrific, gratuitous, violent abuse of another human being&rsquo;s person and dignity - have a vote with the same weight in the government process as the honest and virtuous?&rsquo;<br>
  As usual this is simply NOT a &#8216;race&rsquo; issue but the hustlers spin as such.</p>

		<p>I feel that voting should be done by those at least 21 and over who have no felony record, who can speak English and are literate, have a place to live,not on welfare(disabled on welfare are excluded) and if any person has taken an IQ test, must have scored at least an 80, just like what is necessary to enter the military. People who are felons or who are homeless alcholics for example, shouldn&rsquo;t be voting. </p>

		<p>how interesting!</p>
<p>in order to make their point, they have to leak out a little bit of information about how many blacks are convicted felons - but then they avoid giving a clear figure.</p>
<p>what percentage of black males are convicted felons? Hispanics? whites?</p>
<p>once the reader realizes what a high percentage of black men are violent criminals, their attention might switch from voting rights to fear for their own safety - so the propaganda can easily backfire.</p>
<p>speaking as a former race difference denier, I would say that a lot of white liberals are having an increasingly difficult time performing the elaborate mental acrobatics that are required to stay delusional&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget one thing:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an awful damn hard thing to do to get a felony conviction at this point. Look up the &#8220;Criminal Justice Funnel&#8221; and consider just how few felony crimes actually result in a felony plea or conviction. It is probably 1-2% of felony crimes actually committed, if that.</p>
<p>SO - statistically, every one of these felons has probably committed a fifty or a hundred crimes for each one that has this consequence. The conviction of a felony OUGHT to have bad consequences, and not being able to vote (likely for Obama or Jesse Jackson or someone equally useless) ought to be one of them. </p>
<p>And I do think that limiting franchise to male landowning taxpayers would result in much more thoughtful voting patterns. The almost universal franchise has led us to Obama and, left unchecked, will lead us to becoming just another third-world kleptocracy. </p>

<p>This is absolutely correct. For each felony that a habitual criminal commits and is convicted of, that criminal has committed about two hundred other crimes of other sorts that they have not been arrested, convicted, sent to prison for. Amazing.</p>

		<p>First, I agree with the writer who said in a sane society the loss of voting rights by convicted felons would&rsquo;nt be an issue.  Also, in a sane society it would be acknowledged that blacks commit at least 60% of the violent crimes in this country.  Furthermore, blacks would be told to grow up and accept responsibility for their actions. </p>

		<p>Adding to #14&rsquo;s comment  &mdash;  Also require a test  &mdash;  see if you know the Constitution.  So many people vote to pass laws that should never have even been suggested.</p>
<p>As I recall, the right to vote used to be given to heads of household that owned land.  That meant a widow who owned land could vote.</p>
<p>All around we&rsquo;re seeing this &#8220;universal equality&#8221; nonsense.</p>
<p>That having been said&hellip;once you&rsquo;ve done your time, you have all your rights, including voting, owning a gun, etc.  Or at least you should.</p>

		<p>  Recent brain research indicates that the pre-frontal lobes of the brain do not fully mature until around the age of 25. As most of you probably know this part of the brain is involved in rational judgment.  Why not make the voting age 25?  We all know or have heard of teenagers and people in their early 20&rsquo;s driving irresponsibly.  Maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t drive at 18 either? In goes without saying in my opinion that felons of ANY age shoudn&rsquo;t be allowed to vote.</p>

<p>When the Constitution was adopted there were very few free blacks in the U.S.  How did the Founders know that upon the end of slavery so many blacks would become felons? </p>

		<p>Only two states permanently disbar convicted felons from voting: Florida and Kentucky.  In nearly all the others, one can reregister to vote as soon as probation or parole are completed, and as was mentioned above, that&rsquo;s the hitch.  Many of these (black) offenders never manage to make it off parole or other court supervision before they are caught reoffending.  This is called &#8220;Doing life on the installment plan&#8221;.  Part of it is black culture.  If you can consider culture as the behavior a group of people will adopt when they are not really thinking about how they are behaving, what constitutes &#8220;culture&#8221; is really just habit-based behavior, and when you are on probation or parole, habits are what will either save you or sink you.</p>

<p>Anon,<br>
How unfair! Everyone knows that Blacks shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to obey the law because the &#8220;legacy of Slavery&#8221; has left them with a permanent &#8220;Dooms Day&#8221; gene that can never be redirected.<br>
The solution is to let them do anything they want so as not to lose their franchise.<br>
They should be given free access to businesses, free acceptance at our major universities without the bother of skill assessment. And if they rape and/ or rape &amp; murder a few White coeds along the way, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay given all their suffering over the years. <br>
Come on man!!! Get with the program!<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that this liberal website allowed an extensive quote from an opponent (Spakovsky) of the liberal lunacy cited in the article. Somebody fire that writer!</p>
<p>But seriously, it&rsquo;s not a matter of us disenfranchising one in eight black men, it&rsquo;s a matter of them disenfranchising themselves, when they decided to disregard the rights of others in the commission of a felony. It&rsquo;s a consequence of actions black males willfully took themselves.</p>
<p>But expect to see more and more looney legislation like this as blacks and other minorities become more and more of a majority.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face the fact&rsquo;s here.  Most of these felons given the right to vote aren&rsquo;t going to bother any way so what difference does it make if they can or not?  Most won&rsquo;t bother to work either unfortunately, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they end up back in the slam.  Great country you got there USA but I&rsquo;m gonna stay here in Canada anyway thanks very much.  We&rsquo;ve got enough problem&rsquo;s of our own for sure but we are a few year&rsquo;s behind you in the falling apart category and it&rsquo;ll take us just a little while longer before the wheel&rsquo;s come off completely as yours have already done, based on what one read&rsquo;s here in these post&rsquo;s.

<p>You&rsquo;re correct.  Most &#8220;re-enfranchised&#8221; black felons won&rsquo;t actually vote themselves.  But that&rsquo;s the point.  They will vote, or at least the public records will show that they &#8220;voted.&#8221;  Their names will be on the rolls in some jurisdiction, presumably one that&rsquo;s heavily black.  Corrupt black poll workers will cast a vote in their name after hours, then sign some phony signature next to their name line in the voter roll.  Why do you think precincts from black areas take so long to arrive at the city&rsquo;s or county&rsquo;s central election or canvassing board?  That&rsquo;s because the blacks who run that precinct are holding them back, waiting to see if they can fake up enough ballots to put their chosen person or issue over the top, if the election is close.  It happened in St. Louis a lot in the 1980s and 90s.  (Hint:  When Harold Washington won Mayor of Chicago for the first time in the 1980s, the black voter turnout rate was 98%.  If you really believe that 98% of any racial demographic goes out to vote in United States for any large scale election, then I have some beachfront property in Utah I want to sell you.)  The key to the fraud is having as many people as possible registered to vote, even if they don&rsquo;t vote.</p>

		<p>Another news item from the Philadelphia this evening. Police presence had to be beefed up on Philly&rsquo;s famous South Street due to &#8220;large, unruly crowds&#8221;.  Video couldn&rsquo;t hide the fact that the &#8220;unruly&#8221; were all Black. I&rsquo;d wager that the news report understated the situation. <br>
They had to limit the Mardi Gras celebrations there over the last few years because of widespread property damage to the businesses along the street. Several years ago the video coverage showed large groups of blacks running along the streets sucker punching unsuspecting Whites both male and female.</p>
<p>NO arrests were made in this evening&rsquo;s incident but the knuckle head White teenager whose &#8220;All Black people please leave the store&#8221; WalMart escapade has gotten national attention. It may turn out to be the latest crime of the century.</p>
<p>¡Que Dios nos socorre!</p>
