<h1><a href="https://www.sonorannews.com/archives/2010/100317/ftpgMinuteman.html">Minutemen Return to the Border  &mdash;  This Time Locked and Loaded</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Bentley, Sonoran News (Cave Creek, Arizona), March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On March 15, Minuteman Civil Defense Corps President Carmen Mercer sent out an e-mail message proclaiming, &#8220;High Alert for All Minutemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her message began with, &#8220;Obama cuts border security funding and freezes hiring of new Border Patrol.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wrote, &#8220;The Minutemen are returning to the border  &mdash;  locked and loaded  &mdash;  to say, &#8216;You are wrong Obama, America comes first!&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercer chastised the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, stating Janet Napolitano thinks &#8220;border security is a waste of time and a politically sensitive issue,&#8221; adding the Minutemen are returning to the border  &mdash;  locked and loaded  &mdash;  because they think Napolitano is an &#8220;unqualified buffoon who risks the lives of American citizens every day she is the head of DHS.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mercer called on all MCDC volunteers to return to the southern border with Mexico, en mass, beginning Friday afternoon, March 26, and lasting until Congress deploys the U.S military to our borders to defend the United States of America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For eight long years we Minutemen played nice; yet for the past eight years we firmly expressed our opinions and desires for the border to be secured,&#8221; said Mercer. &#8220;This muster will be completely different. President Obama and John McCain have left us no choice. This March we return to the border locked, loaded and ready to stop each and every individual we encounter along the frontier that is now more dangerous than the frontier of Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said this operation will not be for the faint of heart and MCDC volunteers will work under entirely different Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), as they will approach their duty as citizens with zero tolerance for any and all violations of our border.</p>
<p>Mercer stated, &#8220;We will forcefully engage, detain, and defend our lives and country from the criminals who trample over our culture and laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previously prohibited from MCDC musters, long arms will be not only allowed but encouraged.</p>

		<p>Good to know that some Americans believe in action. The poet, philosopher and scientist,Goethe, said, How are we to know ourselves? By thinking? No, only through action will we learn the truth of what is in us. I&rsquo;ve always admired how profound this statement is. The Minutemen/woman, are the most knowledgable people there are on illegal immigration. The ACLU,SPLC,LA RAZA, and other fifth columnist groups will do their best to interfere with these Americans, even knowing how dangerous the border situation is to all Americans. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Janet Napolitano thinks &ldquo;border security is a waste of time and a politically sensitive issue&rdquo;</p>
<p>If these were Germans, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians and other ethnic Whites crossing over the border you can bet  that &#8220;border security&#8221; would not be a &#8220;waste of time&#8221; nor a &#8220;politically sensitive issue&#8221;! </p>

		<p>I admire her spirit, but I don&rsquo;t think the tact she&rsquo;s using is going to do anything other than make them targets for the feds.  Too, there&rsquo;s no doubt the SPLC and the ACLU will be there to file suits in every instance where an illegal criminal was captured.</p>
<p>Now, if her intent is to create a bit of sensationalism in order to try to force the pro-black community organizer to act in defense of the border in order to prevent any violence, I think she might have a point there; however, I doubt that she&rsquo;s aware that this anti-white hater, and his bigotted attorney general, would welcome the opportunity to prosecute white people, so I think she needs to regroup and consider other alternatives.</p>
<p>If she organizes her group into a self-defense militia and waits just a bit longer, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the situation will implode all on its own.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at the beginning of a countdown to lawlessness which is more apt than not to come in the very near future.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what happens if the Minutepersons (one must be alert for gender-bias) actually intercept and try to turn back illegal crossers.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they&rsquo;ll be forced to defend themselves with lethal force and end up arrested and tried for assault or even murder if an illegal is killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly we&rsquo;re beginning to resemble the risible UK at this point.  That government can&rsquo;t protect its citizens from criminals and in fact doesn&rsquo;t even bother to try any longer. But let a citizen try to protect himself from a criminal assault and the bobbies will be right there to arrest him for &#8220;resisting assault.&#8221; </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;d love to believe that these Minutemen (and women) really can and will patrol the border, in force and heavily armed, as they say they will. However, pledges to do such things by conservative operations all too often come a cropper, with meager turnout and faint hearts.</p>
<p> And how long do you think it will take the liberal establishment to discover   &mdash;   surprise, surprise!   &mdash;   that the Minutemen constitute a &#8220;threat to law and order&#8221; who must be suppressed and   &mdash;   very possibly   &mdash;   arrested en masse on various trumped-up charges so that the illegals can continue to freely flow north?</p>

		<p>I hate to say it but if the military just shot intruders with snipers than they would stop trying to cross on foot. The deaths of a few would preserve the lives of thousands who would die from lack of water. In other words, humanitarians should be praising these people for saving lives. But that will never happen. </p>

		<p>About time.  But you can count on Napolitano acting now.  To send the National Guards or Army to arrest and detain the Minutemen.  She&rsquo;d never send our military to defend our border, but she surely will send our military to defend the invaders access to our border.  </p>

		<p>  Well this should be interesting. If this isn&rsquo;t just rhetoric, and if people in substantial numbers do respond to this call, it will be a clear sign that the political Rubicon has been crossed, and Americans have lost faith in their government sufficiently to put themselves at risk from at least two directions. It will be something the government can&rsquo;t and certainly won&rsquo;t ignore. I wouldn&rsquo;t hold out any hope that they would take the hint and just do what they&rsquo;re supposed to do and stop illegal immigration and smuggling.</p>

		<p>The Minutemen returning to the border is a good idea to alert Americans about the continuing invasion but they will probably not stop Obama in his quest of amnesty for millions.  One reason  Janet Napolitano was appointed was because she believes as Obama does. Also, I watched a high official from ICE being interviewed on  C-Span.  He could not say enough good things about illegal aliens and was clearly on the same wave-length as Obama and Napolitano. The Minutemen are playing against a stacked deck.<br>
In a little over one year, Obama has taken over banks, car companies, healthcare and college loans.  He is now aiming at amnesty and cap and tax while pushing America into bankruptcy. He does all of this while enjoying unlimited support from our &#8220;watch dog&#8221; press.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s going a bit too far, although I can well understand her frustration, but sometimes it takes radical rhetoric in order to get the opposition&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Most other conservatives are too far the other way in being extra careful in what they say, and, as a result, they&rsquo;re regarded as nothing but dupes to be pushed around by leftist radicals, who make a career out of violence-laced language.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the WN&rsquo;s and others on the right need a few vicious talkers who refuse to recant what they say and in the next breath they need to criticize the leftist dregs for inciting hate and violence. </p>
<p>The left only respects those who won&rsquo;t be pushed around, and often the only thing they respect is a good, hard fist.</p>

		<p>Of course we all know the ACLU, La Raza, NAACP will be up in arms and stop us from doing a darn thing to stop these illegals! We see our own country slipping away by the minute and we are the &#8220;haters&#8221; for wanting to keep OUR own country from the 3rd world hoardes.  Talking and playing nice does NO good, it only gives the enemy ammunition to use against us. There is no appeasement nor pandering to these people any longer.</p>

		<p>Wow!  I wonder how long Obama will put up with this?  It&rsquo;s the right thing to do, of course.  Our govt. decided the American people and our country were expendable a long time ago. The only rationale thing to do to save ourselves is to turn them back by force.  And, bar any further immigration by Muslims as well.<br>
I actually think the Muzzies are more dangerous to us than <br>
Mexico&rsquo;s criminals and other illegals entrants, which often includes Muslims, so I hear.  <br>

<p>Totally true statement, and I know that to be true. August 08, Marines and I were reading in the Stars-N-Stripes that we had lost 69 troops in combat in Iraq&hellip;in another section was a casual mention of there having been 121 gunshot murders in chiCONGO!!! we all agreed, we are safer in Iraq or Afghan than in chiCONGO&hellip;ALSO! in the same month, there were 213 of what were listed as &#8220;miscellaneous murders!!!&#8221; how does one get miscellaneously murdered?</p>

		<p>Thank you MINUTEMEN!I will be sending you a donation and I hope all readers and citizens send their financial support and join the effort to support the Minutemen. This is the real war facing the United States&hellip;..not the madness in Afghanistan or Iran. We must demand our troops be brought home and placed on the Mexican boarder to defend our nation and it&rsquo;s people. The US federal government is actively participating in the destruction of our nation. The US federal government consistently refuses to defend the boarders at the expense of the American citizens.<br>
This is history in the making&hellip;dark history that may be defining the destruction of the our: nation, constitution, liberty and freedom.<br>
American citizens can: ignore, deny, choose to remain ignorant, or they can get involved and solve this problem. Send money, donate time, help patrol the boarder for a week, help get the word out. Americans can run from this problem, but there is no escaping. The United States is under attack and our federal government is complicit. It&rsquo;s time for citizen action&hellip;..or kiss American good-bye.</p>

		<p>Finally, enough is enough.  The feds won&rsquo;t lock down the border since it would force them to do something then about the illegals here, all 30 million of them.  These brave Americans are standing there as on the Lexington Green or the North Bridge.  This may be really big, a tripwire to either begin the 2nd Revolution or, the opportunity for the obama communists to use the military against our bravest citizens.  God help us.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve thought for years that the US military should be guarding our borders. Instead, they are in foreign countries, aside from the middle east, that we haven&rsquo;t been involved in a war with for many years. Bring them home and defend our own country for a change. This had been an Alice in Wonderland world for many years now. Our government put everyone ahead of us, especially the corrupt government of Mexico. I&rsquo;ve often wondered what terrible secret Mexico has on the US to cause our leaders to bow and scrape to them. I pray we soon elect someone who care more about us that pleasing the rest of the world. We haven&rsquo;t had that &#8220;someone&#8221; in a very long time.</p>

		<p>Interesting little developement. I think its what they used to call patriotism and now call zenophobia. Accountabillity and taking inventory on who belongs here in the US is timely with all the enemy&rsquo;s we have, the difficult economy, the drug cartels, etc. There is a time to tighten, and a time to loosen the belt&hellip; I think we can see the latter is the correct option for now. With a mulatto as figure head, between black and white, between Christian and Muslim, with uncertain nationality with socialist leanings&hellip;Yes Virginy&hellip;the white boys will have to secure their future or go over a cliff. Nothing against Mexicans, Mulattos or any of the other &#8220;in vogue&#8221; ambiguous contortions of this era, just white survival with dignity in a nation whites created with Gods help.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a cheap way for the government to secure our Southern Border&hellip; DEPUTIZE the Minutemen as civillian border patrol auxiliaries. Train them. Then let groups of them patrol the border. UNDER the command of an experienced border patrol agent or serving military officer. Give them the power to arrest illegals and to carry defensive weapons.

		<p>  Armed Americans on the southern border is a great idea.An<br>
even better idea would be millions of armed and angry Americans<br>
marching on the nations capitol.<br>
  As a 67 year old disabled veteran I feel like a man without a<br>
country.My country was last seen swirling down the Orwellian<br>
toilet bowl of socialism,liberalism,diversity,multi culturism,<br>
and political correctness.RIP America.</p>

		<p>I have to concur with Wayne Engle&rsquo;s comment, as much as I&rsquo;d like to believe the Minutemen can help.</p>
<p>I would suggest this idea&hellip; and make it our prime objective:</p>
<p>THIS NOVEMBER 2ND, RE-ELECT NOBODY!</p>
<p>The rats in power simply don&rsquo;t deserve to be re-elected.</p>

		<p>There are so many people predicting failure. I don&rsquo;t. The people who show up on the border locked and loaded have already proven unimaginable courage and the will to sacrifice. They are the ones in the arena. They sacrifice all while we sacrifice nothing. Who are we to sit back with our arms folded and judge methods, tactics and details. They&rsquo;re fighting our battles, literally. I predict a shot across the bow of the anti-americans unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. The more people who show up with guns on the border, the more the government will back down, backpeddle and submit to the will of the real America which they obviously despise. If only a dozen minutemen show up, it will be historic. Go minutemen! ROCK ON!</p>

		<p>I agree with Ranger.  While the idea is right, the outcome will likely be CNN programs on the new domestic terrorist threat, all the old critics coming out to say, &#8220;We told you so!&#8221; etc.  If we just wait a little while the government will be forced to recognize the situation because the violence is spilling over into the US.  Taking a defensive position is legal and makes more sense.  Until the Mexican government actually collapses, which could be soon, the political support for citizen soldiers on the border will only cause those citizens legal problems and the overall movement for white (and American) survival.</p>

		<p>I can sympathize with Unreconstructed, who has served his country honorably only to see its values and freedoms, in effect everything he fought for and risked his life to defend, betrayed by our corrupted government. I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: we&rsquo;ve gone from world-leading, prosperous melting pot to bankrupt, dysfunctional chamber pot in a few short dedcades.<br>
How did it all go so wrong&hellip;?</p>

		<p>The Minutemen better be very careful they fully go over every member they have.  It is no secret that the FBI has informants and &#8216;Plants&rsquo; in every single group which is &#8220;non-establishment.&#8221;  Even the Ron Paul movement had them.</p>
<p>And, their mission is NOT to make sure the Minutemen do no &#8220;wrong.&#8221; They are there to make sure they DO.  An &#8220;accidental&#8221; or &#8220;premeditated&#8221; SHOOTING of an illegal alien will result in the immediate demonization of the Minutemen as a &#8220;Right Wing Fringe Group,&#8221; thus subjecting it to &#8216;Domestic Terrorism&rsquo; status and subsequent prosecution by DHS.</p>

		<p>I think the MInutemen have done great work.</p>
<p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this new Minuteman action was this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously prohibited from MCDC musters, long arms will be not only allowed but encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pistols and Shot guns are for defense - long riffles offense. </p>
<p>This is a defensive action.</p>

		<p>I think the Minutemen are rebel-like contemporary American heroes. These guys have decided to take matters into thier own hands, since a weak and corrupted government in Washington, has let them down (repeatedly).</p>
<p>Since this is happenning in Arizona, near Texas, I&rsquo;d say that I think Bowie and the other men at the Alamo would be proud!</p>

		<p>I hope the Minutemen are serious about taking the gloves off.  If they talk tough then turn tail once at the border they will become a laughingstock.  I&rsquo;m curious to see how Janet Reno Jr. (Napolitano) and the rest of the anti-white beltway elites react.  </p>
<p>The lesson here is that the Minutemen played nice, looked pretty for the cameras and tried to influence the system from within.  While galvanizing people much like the tea parties they failed to encourage official Washington to take more proactive stance on the illegal alien invasion.  They simply failed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming painfully clear that the respectability gambit touted by some isn&rsquo;t winning converts in the establishment.  Perhaps a more two fisted approach is necessary to facilitate the change to the system that we seek.   <br>

		<p>She&rsquo;d never send our military to defend our border, but she surely will send our military to defend the invaders access to our border. </p>
<p>Remember that the French Foreign Legion was never allowed to set foot on French soil until very recently, and the reason was that since most were not of French heritage, their interests may not have been in the best interests of France! We now have the same problem with our own U.S. military in that so many are hispanic and Africans (actually FROM Africa) and their interests are certainly and demonstrably NOT in the best interest of White America.</p>

		<p>&#8220;RUB THEIR NOSES IN THE REALITY HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS REALLY DO COMMIT A LOT OF CRIMES ONE HERE.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be snarky, but don&rsquo;t you think they already know that? The problem is not that our political &#8220;leaders&#8221; do not UNDERSTAND the harm that their policies are inflicting on this nation, it&rsquo;s that they know and simply do not CARE. After all, what is the reality of street crime and huge consumption of resources caused by illegal immigration to them anyway? It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re affected by it. In the same way, they don&rsquo;t care if the average citizen gets screwed over by the new healthcare legislation because they&rsquo;re not part of that system and they the best medical care in the world for free, for life. It&rsquo;s hard for the average, well-meaning, upright and honorable patriotic citizen to wrap their head around the fact of this indifference on the part of politicians because it&rsquo;s not in their civic &#8220;DNA&#8221; to act that way and they have a hard time imagining anyone who would. It was hard for me to grasp and still is, but the fact remains, politicians DO act that way and it&rsquo;s deliberate and not from simple ignorance.</p>
<p>Sorry for the digression, but the point is that a lot people don&rsquo;t seem to realize that politicians literally couldn&rsquo;t care less about the harm they inflict because they only reap the benefits such as bribes (i.e. &#8220;campaign contributions&#8221;), power, media adulation, becoming part of the elite, etc, etc. and never have to live with the consequences of what they&rsquo;ve done. So, where&rsquo;s the incentive for them to change their ways? There isn&rsquo;t any, other than the statistically minor threat of them being voted out of office and even then, a cushy retirement awaits along with many guest appearances as a talking head on the networks, remaining plugged in as a lobbyist and so on and so forth. Note that I&rsquo;m not advocating anything here, just observing that politicians are like animals and kids and if you raised either with the same set of stimuli that politicians have, you&rsquo;d have dog whiz all over your house, the kids would be stealing from your wallet and your car would be totaled. Kind of sounds like the state of the body politic a little, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>They seem like they take what they are doing seriously. But then, the boarder jumpers have the system on their side, now. I think if the Minutemen wre to actually shoot one of those boarder jumpers, they might end up in deep trouble.</p>
