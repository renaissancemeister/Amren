			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 20, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At first sight, the piles of rubbish and debris strewn across this garden make it look just like a rubbish tip.</p>
<p>But on closer inspection, it is revealed to be a makeshift camp for desperate Eastern European immigrants.</p>
<p>Around a dozen are camping out in residents&rsquo; gardens, sheds and even their trees as they cannot afford their own homes.</p>
<p>Those who live in the street in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, have been told they are powerless to remove the trespassers taking shelter on their land.</p>
<p>Groups of immigrants have moved into the gardens of at least six properties since November last year, leaving a trail of cider bottles, bags of human waste and drugs needles behind them.</p>
<p>Though homeowners have appealed for help, the police and council say they cannot arrest the trespassers  &mdash;  who have no passports and are mostly from Eastern Europe  &mdash;  because they claim it is a civil, not a criminal matter.</p>
<p>The immigrants gained access to the land through an open alleyway and sleep on dirty mattresses, using rolled-up blankets as pillows.</p>
<p>Ian Treasure, 41, one of the homeowners affected by the camps, said a man named Joseph from the Czech Republic was living in his garden coal shed.</p>
<p>Despite six phone calls to Peterborough City Council pleading with them to evict the immigrants and remove the mountains of dumped rubbish, he could not get the man to leave.</p>
<p>Mr Treasure said: &#8216;The area has become overrun. It is disgusting and the worst thing is that nobody is doing anything about it. Every day it gets worse.</p>
<p>&#8216;It all started in November. I was looking out of the window and I saw a mattress in my coal shed. I went out and it turned out I had a lodger there.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not sure how many there are because I try to stay away from them but I&rsquo;m fed up because they regularly drink in our gardens and take drugs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Treasure said he had asked the man, who speaks broken English and has scabs on his face, to leave dozens of times.</p>
<p>&#8216;The angriest I have got was the first time I saw drug needles there in January. I freaked out,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Treasure added that he was incredibly frustrated that the council and police had done nothing to help him.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The police&rsquo;s hands are tied. All they can do is just move them on and then they would be back so it would be a waste of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ricky Smith, 23, attempted to remove the squatter in his shed after catching him defecating on his lawn on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I slung all his belongings into a pile and told him to get out. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since so hopefully he has got the message.</p>
<p>&#8216;I caught him defecating on my lawn, where my dog plays. I had to build a fence to keep him out of that part of the garden so my dog doesn&rsquo;t get ill playing in his mess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cambridgeshire police said that the makeshift camps were not a criminal matter.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Anybody is allowed to use reasonable force to stop people trespassing and get them off their property  &mdash;  much like a bouncer in a pub or club.</p>
<p>&#8216;If there is some sort of confrontation then we can step in and prevent a breach of the peace, but we cannot act directly against the trespassers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Peterborough council said: &#8216;We are aware of a number of people who are sleeping in these gardens.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will be working to help them access the services which are available to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peterborough&rsquo;s MP Stewart Jackson today said Labour had failed to deal with immigration problems that have led to jobless migrants camping in British gardens.</p>
<p>The Tory MP said: &#8216;The Labour government was warned that uncontrolled immigration would cause these sorts of problems.</p>
<p>&#8216;They have ignored Peterborough&rsquo;s needs and local taxpayers have been forced to foot the bill for their foolish and misguided policies.&rsquo;<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259798/Man-goes-work-comes-home-Romanian-family-moved-in.html">Homeowner Who Forgot His Wallet Returns to Find Romanian Family Moving in in Scene From &lsquo;Dickensian Times&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Daily Mail (London), March 22, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A householder returned from work early to discover a Romanian family had moved into his home, a court heard.</p>
<p>The man was astounded to find Mihai and Laura Dediu moving his belongings out of his cupboards while their young child looked on.</p>
<p>The couple claimed they had been told that the two-bedroomed end-of-terrace property in Northampton had been empty for some time and they could squat there.</p>
<p>Northampton Crown Court heard the man had left his home on December 7 last year, but returned shortly afterwards because he forgot his wallet. He discovered the couple had forced their way in.</p>
<p>Judge Richard Baray said: &#8216;The owner comes back at 5pm and there&rsquo;s an unknown car parked in his drive and the lights to the house are on.</p>
<p>&#8216;He goes in and finds these two defendants and, wait for it, a young child.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are going back to Dickensian times it appears.</p>
<p>&#8216;When challenged, the defendants say they own the property and are just moving in and that the male defendant was going to alter the locks as part of that process.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then an unidentified person attends to take the child away. What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>&#8216;This is a bizarre case. I must be the most experienced person in this building for burglary and in 26 years I cannot remember a case where burglars have taken a young child with them to carry out a burglary. I really can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mihai Dediu, 30, and his wife Laura, 24, pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage to the locks and windows. A burglary charge was dropped.</p>
<p>Ben Gow, defending, said the couple had been told by a man they met in a shop that they could live at the address.</p>
<p>The victim, who was not named, was not at home this morning.</p>
<p>A neighbour said: &#8216;He is a middle aged white man who lives on his own and keeps himself to himself. He also leaves the curtains drawn so I suppose someone could believe the house was empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple, who do not speak English, were sentenced them to 12 month community orders with 100 hours community service.<br>

		<p>The law must be very different in England.  </p>
<p>Trespass denies me the lawful enjoyment of my property. If someone doesn&rsquo;t comply with a request to leave, I can have a police officer lay a trespassing charge.</p>
<p>From there, things escalate sharply.</p>

		<p>Well, the police said you can use reasonable force &hellip; so do it, and stop complaining.</p>
<p>White people, it seems to me, are now afraid to get mad. I suppose this is understandable, with so many laws (especially in GB) to hang you up (maybe literally).</p>
<p>But &hellip; this is carte blanche for butt-kicking! Get in there!<br>

		<p>Knowing what a sad and pathetic little Kingdom Great Britain is I am sure that if the porperty owner is just a tad too rough with the coalshed border the coalshed border may end up owning the whole property!  And the owner ends up in prison.  The new Britain!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure any property owner who tries to kick the trespassers off his property will be charged with a hate crime.  It is of course easier to persuade unwanted guests to leave if you have a shotgun, but the Brits let their government take away their guns some years back   &mdash;   the first step towards tyranny.</p>

		<p>I could go on and on about the &#8220;much like a bouncer in a pub&#8221; bit but I won`t. I did have experience a long time ago what some people refuse to believe happened. A &#8220;hider&#8221; in the house. That`s a burglar who moves in but stays out of sight or out of house while your at home.<br>
 It was 1977, a year after high school. A former classmate of mine, who knew I had a working mother, and my &#8220;secret&#8221; way into the attic lived unknown among us for six weeks to two months.<br>
 Our house was his house from 8:00 till 4:30pm. Those nights he wanted to stay out late he would &#8220;rough it&#8221; in the woods down the street. If he wanted to stay in he had our old TV which had &#8220;disappeared&#8221; from the garage to listen to with head phones.<br>
  He was finally busted by me, not at home but on the street. My mother and I were coming home fifteen minutes before our usual time when I normally picked her up at work. I saw the guy at the bottom of our street. He saw me in the car and did a turn around, shielding his face.  It was bizarre to see him in our neighborhood as he use to live about five miles away. When I got home I went upstairs to use the bathroom. There was a single tiny mesquite thorn in an otherwise imacculate bath tub. &#8220;Bingo!&#8221; Mike&hellip; working mom&hellip; attic entrance&hellip; woods&hellip; twig&hellip;! <br>
 It got sick and scary when I found his &#8216;lair&rsquo; behind a false wall of suitcases a moment later. I put it out of mind until years later when I happened to see a Gary Bussey movie with the exact same theme. I believe it was called A&rsquo; Hider in the House&#8221;.</p>

		<p>What is the world coming to?  The bobbies(British name for police)cannot stop criminal trespassing on the property of British citizens?!  What is next for Great Britain, legalized burglery?</p>
<p>It is bad enough the British people cannot own guns to defend themselves, but now they cannot go to the police to stop trespassers on their own property.</p>
<p>British gun control is a failure.  I do not know if it is on the agenda of the British National Party, but I think Nick Griffin and the BNP should have on their platform, a repeal of Britain&rsquo;s repressive gun laws so that British citizens can have the right to bear arms, deportation of these illegal immigrants described in this article, and of course, property rights so that Britain&rsquo;s bobbies can arrest and get rid of these intruders.  </p>
<p>Of course, the British Royal Family has special privilleges that other British people do not have.  For example, the Queen of England can legally carry a handgun in her purse. </p>
<p>But even worse and hypocritical, there is no way these Eastern European immigrants, without even passports, would ever be allowed to trespass on any property owned by the British Royal Family!  If they did, they would be promptly arrested and prosecuted!</p>
<p>But if that is not bad enough, with today&rsquo;s liberalism in the USA, the same kind of tolerance for such disgusting trespassers could happen here, by making it a &#8220;civil matter&#8221; for the homeless people like these to trespass on properties owned by our own citizens.  In the same way, that would make our own police unable to arrest such trespassers.</p>
<p>There are decent homeless people, who are intelligent individuals and who are willing to work, if they can find employment.  These kind of homeless people deserve our sympathy and support, but they still do not have the right to trepass on other people&rsquo;s private property.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is also the other kind of homeless people, who are unwilling to work and will only accept welfare.  Of course, this includes blacks, hispanics, and even lazy, low-life white people.</p>
<p>I used to live in Gladwyne, a Philadelphia suburb, on a spacious piece of property, before moving into center city Philadelphia in 1986.</p>
<p>Up until 2004, my family had a vacation house, with about three acres of yard, in the famous township of East Hampton, NY, on Long Island.</p>
<p>Neither in Gladwyne, nor in East Hampton, would I ever want such intruders on what used to be my family&rsquo;s property.  I cannot help, but feel sympathy and outrage as to what these British people are having to put up with!</p>

		<p>I am getting so tired of this British habit of calling gypsies &#8220;Eastern European&#8221; and &#8220;Romanian&#8221;.</p>
<p>Can one of our British posters here answer- Is it considered &#8220;racist&#8221; to call them gypsies or tsigini? <br>
Or is this a habit to fool people that these criminals<br>
and vagabonds are White Romanians, Poles, Ukranians, etc.?</p>
<p>Quote from the first story:<br>
&#8220;&lsquo;We will be working to help them access the services which are available to them.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Am I correct in supposing this to mean that they will get welfare and jump to the front of the line, ahead of deserving White British people, for a Council House (I think this is the correct term, if not please correct me) and any other benefits paid for by taxpayers?</p>

 The Daily Mail is a British newspaper that just loves o defame and denigrate White East Europeans at every available opportunity, and the half-truth misinformation was a deliberate editorial decision.</p>

		<p>I am Irish, and have been living in Romania on and off for seven years.  Rest assured, everyone, that the average Romanian does not trespass on other peoples&rsquo; property, defecate on their lawns or expose their children to hazards such as needles, any more than any Brit, Irish or other western Europeans or indeed, civilized people anywhere.</p>
<p>The culprits are gypsies, or &#8216;Roma&rsquo; as they are often referred.  Is it any consolation - OK, probably not - that in their home country many of them (not all) cause the same kind of problems?  Stealing manhole covers in the middle of roads and rails from railway lines (yes, endangering lives in both cases) are just some of their habits.</p>
<p>What those people described in the article do is abominable, and I can easily understand the homeowners&rsquo; frustration.  But can some elements of the western media PLEASE stop referring to them as Eastern Europeans?  Yes, that&rsquo;s where they are from, but this is not how their behaviour should be defined, any more than football hooligans should be referred to as British or a mafioso as Italian.</p>
<p>Regarding those trespassers, what I would personally do to them in that situation is not something I would describe in print lest it be deemed incitement to violence!</p>

		<p>Too bad the British let their guns be confiscated, &#8220;Broken English&#8221; or not, the trespasser would have understood a .45  pointed at his nose! As far as I know, owning a pet is still legal in England, so get a large, deep-voiced dog, with sharp teeth. How do you even wrap your head around the idea that total strangers began moving into your home while you were at work? If they had succeeded in changing the locks, would the British police have removed them, or would they have been afraid of &#8220;offending&#8221; them? As for people camping out in back yards, it&rsquo;s unthinkable that the police can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t put a stop to this. Again, what do you expect from a white population that has no means of self-defence against dark people who have no sense of personal property, decency or civility.</p>

		<p>Jeddermann, I&rsquo;d imagine the scabs on the Gipsy&rsquo;s face were &#8220;pick marks&#8221;. Meth addicts pick at their faces, for some reason.  Look at the &#8216;Before and After&rsquo; shots of Meth addicts that are all over the Internet, and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>If the scabs were not on his face, I&rsquo;d assume they were Scabies.</p>
