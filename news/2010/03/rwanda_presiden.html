<h1><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8545120.stm">Rwanda President&rsquo;s Widow Held in France Over Genocide</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The widow of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose assassination triggered the Rwandan genocide, has been arrested in France.</p>
<p>Agathe Habyarimana is accused by the current Rwandan government of helping to plan the 1994 genocide, and has long been sought by prosecutors there.</p>
<p>Mrs Habyarimana, who has been living in France for several years, denies the accusations.</p>
<p>More than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in the massacres of 1994.</p>
<p>French officials said Mrs Habyarimana was detained in the Paris region by police executing a Rwandan-issued international arrest warrant.</p>
<p>Mrs Habyarimana, who was flown out of Rwanda by the French military in the early days of the violence, has been seeking political asylum in France, without success.</p>
<p>Her arrest follows a visit to the Rwandan capital Kigali last week by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, when he admitted that France  &mdash;  and the wider international community  &mdash;  had make &#8220;mistakes&#8221; over the genocide.</p>
<p>His comments followed years of strained relations between the two countries.</p>
<p><b>Extradition?</b></p>
<p>Diplomatic relations were restored late last year having broken down after a French judge said President Paul Kagame had been behind President Habyarimana&rsquo;s assassination, and Rwanda accused France of arming the Hutu militias involved in the 1994 genocide.</p>
<p>Mrs Habyarimana&rsquo;s lawyer said her arrest was directly linked to Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t not draw a link,&#8221; said Philippe Meilhac. &#8220;The extradition request from Kigali dates back to November and was obviously re-activated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rwanda has welcomed her arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are encouraged by these new developments and the fact that the long arm of the law has finally taken its course,&#8221; said Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama.</p>
<p>Mrs Habyarimana has now been freed on bail.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Catherine Zemmouri in Paris says it is not clear if France will extradite her to Rwanda.</p>
<p>She says that French magistrates have recently refused to send three suspects to Rwanda fearing they would not receive a fair trial  &mdash;  an argument repeated by Mrs Habyarimana&rsquo;s lawyer.</p>
<p>France has, however, extradited suspects to the UN-backed International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>
<p>President Habyarimana died in April 1994 when his jet was hit by a missile over the Kigali airport.</p>
<p>Hardline ethnic Hutu supporters of the president then launched the apparently pre-planned massacres.<br>

		<p>French officials said Mrs Habyarimana was detained in the Paris region by police executing a Rwandan-issued international arrest warrant.</p>
<p>I wonder why such a warrant wasn&rsquo;t honored by Saudi Arabia when a number of African nations issued it for Idi Amin who was living as a &#8220;head of state&#8221; in Saudi&hellip;Just wondering. Idi was given a state funeral when he died a few years ago and the U.S. sent a state dept. rep. to attend!!!</p>

		<p>Exactly what right does France have to arrest a non-French citizen for actions outside France?<br>
Leftist do not let little things like rule of law bother them.<br>
Is there any doubt they will parade a bunch of witnesses from the other tribe to swear she did whatever.She may have done whatever she is accused of, but it is my bet it was one blood thirsty group that got the drop on another bloodthirsty group first.<br>
Of course the victim group is portrayed as choirboys butchured on their way to church service.  </p>

		<p>Idi Amin was trained by Jews, supported by Jews, then turned on them and erected a statue of Adolph Hitler. He allowed terrorists to bring a whole plane load of them into Entebbe and gave the terrorists a safe haven.  That&rsquo;s why the Saudis allowed him sanction.  His hatred of Jews.  Hmmmm.  American blacks were first trained by American Jews, supported by American Jews, the NAACP was founded by Jews and financed by Jews, and now the American black turns on them, hates them, and Farrakhan and Sharpton, both Jew haters, are their heroes.  The black man is at least consistent in his ingratitude whether it be in Africa or in America.  Like a rabid dog, blacks will turn on and destroy any who reach a hand out in kindness.  WHEN will we learn?????</p>

		<p>I believe the Tutsis (who look like Ethiopians) are smarter and more civilized than the Hutus and their genocide by the more primitive Hutus was something I disliked but why should we care about what black people in Africa or anywhere else do? The more we ignore them and the more they ignore us, the better it is. Let the blacks in Africa massacre and butcher themselves. As long as the beautiful wildlife is left alone, why should we care?<br>
