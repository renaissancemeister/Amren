<h1>Tens of Thousands Rally for Immigration Reform</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Karush, Yahoo! News, March 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Frustrated with the lack of action to overhaul the country&rsquo;s immigration system, tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied on the National Mall and marched through the streets of the capital Sunday, waving American flags and holding homemade signs in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>Supporters traveled from around the country in hopes the rally would re-energize Congress to take up the volatile issue. Some lawmakers oppose any attempt to help an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants become U.S. citizens while others insist on stronger border controls first.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama, who promised to make overhauling the immigration system a top priority in his first year, sought to reassure those at the rally with a video message presented on giant screens at the National Mall. The president said he was committed to working with Congress this year on a comprehensive bill to fix a &#8220;broken immigration system.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., released an outline of a bill last week that calls for illegal immigrants who want to get on the path to legal status to admit they broke the law by entering the U.S., pay fines and back taxes, and perform community service. They also would be required to pass background checks and be proficient in English before working toward legal residency, required before becoming a citizen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities in D.C. don&rsquo;t provide crowd estimates, but the mall was full of people for three blocks.</p>
<p>People held signs with slogans such as, &#8220;You need us as much as we need you,&#8221; and &#8220;No Human Being is Illegal.&#8221; Many waved American flags, and a few also carried the banners of their countries of origin.</p>
<p>One group from Queens, N.Y., displayed a giant papier-mache family  &mdash;  a mother and two crying children. {snip}<br>

		<p>Bold face lie. These non-white invaders are trying to make an economic case for the race-replacement of the majority NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICAN population. There is no economic argument for OUR race-replacement. AMERICA has been invaded. Time to repel the invasion. The intent of these nonwhite illegal aliens is to outbreed and race-rplace NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS.</p>

		<p>Oh, we know you need us. But no, we don&rsquo;t need you. In fact, because of illegal immigration, our healthcare system is in shambles. When you continue to offer free healthcare to those who are not citizens, it isn&rsquo;t a surprise when emergency departments on the border shut down and hospitals say, &#8220;No mas!&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard a story about a woman who was out of work. She noticed an opportunity in her town - cleaning houses that were repossessed. She jumped on a chance to earn some money and now has a few people working for her. This, is the kind of job that supposedly &#8220;no American wanted to do.&#8221; Well, guess what, amigos? When our economy is busted beyond recognition, Americans WILL do jobs that before they wouldn&rsquo;t - because we need to pay our bills, our mortgages, and eat.</p>
<p>If the illegals keep pushing, they may find a very unpleasant reaction. At this point in our country, Americans are tired of being shafted and are throwing their heads out the windows shouting, &#8220;I&rsquo;m mad as hell and I&rsquo;m not going to take it anymore!&#8221;</p>

<p>Notice how the mainfringe media has been all over this story, yet they refused to write one single word about hundreds of thousands of tea partiers that periodically hold protests around the country?  The million people in Washington was ignored also.</p>
<p>I say, give them amnesty.  The sooner they get it the sooner this country is going to fold, and many of us are looking forward to that so we can build anew.<br>

<p>Ironic, because most of their countries of origin have pretty much zero tolerance for the human beings that we&rsquo;re supposed to think aren&rsquo;t illegal, and their government don&rsquo;t think they need us very much.  The Mexican Constitution proscribes that a Mexican citizen most own or co-own every piece of real estate in the country, though this provision is rarely enforced outside the valuable coasts.</p>

<p>So, the invaders have learned only a very little (but they have accepted the fact that telling whites, for the time being at least, that they are &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; on this continent is something that bears only the fruit of truculent evil, but not actual knowledge,) and still cling to a hope that most real Americans can be mystified into a &ldquo;we are a nation of immigrants&rdquo; lethargy. Moreover, the :&ldquo;You need us as much as we need you&rdquo; pabulum, indicates the same; interestingly, they never clearly separate their needs from &ldquo;our needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How surprising!</p>
<p>Indeed, it is; or put another way, it is only as surprising as two Communist traitors such as Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. coming up with their &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; and &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; solutions to this crisis of race and culture in the USA.</p>

		<p>&#8220;No human being is illegal&#8221;.Go to Mexico as an illegal alien, and see how far you can get saying that. We need them as much as they need us? We need them to bankrupt our hospitals, overcroud our schools,clog our freeways with ever more traffic, kill thousands of us with their drunken reckless drivers, and add more to the housing shortage.</p>

		<p>The fact that this event was held the exact same time the dems were ramming Obamacare down all our throats reveals what this is REALLY all about.</p>
<p>Most non-whites are in this country for one reason only&hellip;.welfare.  Money and stuff they don&rsquo;t have to lift a finger for.</p>
<p>They know this and the marxists controling Obama know this.  As welfare dries up, their reason for being here dissolves.  As states tighten up on the welfare, the federal government is in a frenzy to give it to them on a national level&hellip;..and free healthcare is a biggy.</p>
<p>The US is going to rapidly split on this issue.  Those areas that implement Obamacare from those areas that refuse.  Those areas that refuse will mysteriously become overwhelmingly white.  While those areas that implement this turn into third world hellholes&hellip;..and their demands on the federal government will increase exponentially.</p>
<p>Then the tax revolts will start.</p>

		<p>I do not believe any country needs any immigration, ever.  Any problems or concerns a Nation may have can be solved by its own citizens.  As for the comments:<br>
&#8220;You need us as much as we need you&rdquo;: No, we don&rsquo;t need them, and they don&rsquo;t need us.  How about they solve their own problems in their own countries and we&rsquo;ll solve our problems here?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Human Being is Illegal.&rdquo;: We either follow the law set down by our words or we will end up following someone else&rsquo;s law of the gun.</p>

		<p>Rather than clooging up American streets and making demands to a government not their own, why don&rsquo;t these foreign invadors instead head south to Mexico and demand that a country now home to the world&rsquo;s richest man do more to improve its own economy and raise living standards?! These people have one hell of a nerve to come here illegaly and then act as if they&rsquo;re the victims and the US the culprit for their troubles. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Queens, NY and I can tell you I feel like I&rsquo;m in a foreign country.  The people that are still left in the neighborhood that are non-Hispanic and natural born American citizens are either too old to get out or too poor or too attached to their homes because they have so many fond memories of the past.  You get on a subway train and there isn&rsquo;t a soul who speaks English.  I wanted so badly to avoid the rush-hour crowds on the train that I started leaving very early for work, much earlier than I needed to and found quite a surprise - other White people had the same idea, there were actually more White people - and then I realized that they too thought of this.  Unfortunately the evening can&rsquo;t be avoided.  I swear I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.  We&rsquo;re like strangers in our own country.  I read that Queens is changing faster than any borough in NYC or anyplace in the country for that matter.  The Koreans have literally taken over Flushing and are moving west into places like Bayside.  You see For Sale signs everywhere - that&rsquo;s the tipoff that a neighborhood is changing.  Long Beach Long Island is another place that Block-busting real estates are driving White people out.  Long Beach used to be a beautiful place, but now as we drove through we see more and more Mexicans and For Sale signs everywhere.  We have to start fighting back or we are finished as a country.</p>

		<p>I have a problem with the bipartisan &#8220;amnesty&#8221;proposal. How are some of these people going to pay so called &#8220;back&#8221; taxes because many of them worked under the table or as a migrant farm worker? Also there is going to have to be some sort of stimulus funding for the new ESL classes that will have to be started because the state and local governments are to cash strapped to pay for them.</p>

		<p>Nothing is &#8220;broken&#8221;.  BHO lies.  The government has simply and deliberately refused to guard the borders for the last 45 years.  And there is, BTW, no difference between &#8220;legals&#8221; and &#8220;illegals&#8221;.  The government wants any and all non-Whites, in order to displace real Americans.  If the government makes no real distinction between the two groups, there is none.  </p>

If our spineless government would enforce laws instead of ignoring them, we would not now be overrun with the low-skilled, poorly educated  masses who think they are entitled to the things only a citizen deserves. We have become the dumping ground of the world and on our way to quickly becoming the next third world nation. </p>

		<p>WRONG! WE DON&rsquo;T NEED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!<br>
Let the profit sucking business and corporate entities pay a fair wage to American workers. That tired line of garbage is enough to make anyone see red. The greedy businesses would rather screw Americans by offering slave wages than help our country. Yet we&rsquo;re expected to patronize them   &mdash;   for their services and products.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a worthwhile suggestion: BOYCOTT a specific business in your area known for its large staff of [probably illegal] Latino help. Urge others to do the same. </p>
<p>Our family refuses to patronize any fast-food franchise for that reason. Guess what? We end up eating better (healthier) and save money in the bargain. Nor do we have to worry about that well-known lack of cleanliness by Mexican food handlers.</p>

You have the belief in the creedal nation, a general anti-White philosophy permeating society, relative wealth and comfort for the majority of people, the situation where the White population is declining and so is contracting into ever smaller areas of the nation.  As we move, we sell off previous property to the new ihabitants, thus retaining some individual wealth, with less thought for the nation as a whole.  Throw in White-guilt and we have our current situation.  On a side note, I don&rsquo;t believe people are purchasing so many weapons to ever fight the government, but in order to be prepared after the government (and everything else) falls apart.</p>

		<p>We really don&rsquo;t need any more immigrants; neither carpenter, landscaper, agrarian nomad, auto mechanic, cable television installer, computer programmer, lawyer, professor, or IT administrator. We don&rsquo;t need any of them because we are self-reliant.</p>

<p>Manure! This country needs more illegal aliens in about the same way one dying from lung-cancer needs a few more cigarettes!!</p>
<p>The only reform we need in regard to this illegal invasion is a whole new leadership that possesses the spine to guard/seal the borders, endforce the laws and deport the tresspassers! How hard is that to understand?!</p>

		<p>&#8220;You get on a subway train and there isn&rsquo;t a soul who speaks English.&#8221; Stop Them</p>
<p>  The last time I was in New York City, about ten years ago, it was the same way on the NYC subway. Two short, primitive looking &#8220;indios&#8221; dressed as peasants from Central America got on at one subway stop and both were holding body length iron staffs/bars. I was surprised that no policeman stopped them and the few white riders desperately acted like they didn&rsquo;t want to see them. There were also many Guatemalan? children running around on that particular train. I felt like some kind of Anthropologist in the Yucatan rather than a tourist in America&rsquo;s largest city. </p>

		<p>White liberals, politicians, etc. would rather DIE than do anything that would earn them the title of &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>THEY WOULD RATHER DIE!!</p>
<p>Not only that, those same guilt-ridden haters of their own race and self that are embedded in all levels of our government and legal system would have people like us jailed and killed without any second thought rather than honestly and boldly address these critical issues that are dividing and dismantling this once-great republic.</p>
<p>And as far as the word (racist) that stops these lily-livered liberals dead in their tracks, it was coined by Leiba Davidovich Bronstein better known as Leon Trotsky:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many on the Right reject the terms as &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;Racialism&#8221; as Marxist concepts. According to the Oxford English Dictionary the term &ldquo;racist&rdquo; was coined by Leon Trotsky in 1930. Leon Trotsky used the term &#8220;racism&#8221; as early as 1933. Anti-racism is a major focus of Cultural Marxism.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Just to state what may be obvious to us but not to visitors, the American public has shown consistently, when asked in a forthright polls, that they oppose mass immigration.  Despite this, our politicians have seen fit to fundamentally alter the racial demographics of our country without our permission.</p>
<p>That said, I do not need or want immigrants.  Quite the contrary, I need and want them to leave.</p>

<p>Excellent post John (and Svigor):</p>
<p>Politicians want power and they will do anything to attain it and keep it.  For some it is the allure of the money and perks that come along with that power  &mdash;  for most it is sheer power, to have the ability to bend others to your will (however perverted!). </p>
<p>And all those plans hatched by Trotsky worked very well, didn&rsquo;t they?  I&rsquo;d like to ask the 62 million dead in the Soviet Union or 35 million dead in the Red Chinese ant hill what they think of Trotsky&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>If anyone has not see Charlie Wilson&rsquo;s War, go rent it, it will give you a peek into what is going on in Congress.  Charlie Wilson admits that he was PAID OFF, by hostile elites to &#8216;vote correctly&rsquo; and serve as a pawn for those who funded his campaigns.   </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in return, Charlie lived a fully-funded life of debauchery, plied with his favorite pastimes of drug, alcohol and women in exchange for votes that he was probably too drunk to understand  &mdash;  it didn&rsquo;t matter to him, as he remarked (after he was accused of using cocaine):  &#8220;Nobody knows the answer to that and I ain&rsquo;t telling!&#8221;  </p>
<p>He served 12 terms.</p>
<p>Ted Kennedy served 47 years, got away with a real murder,  and lived a similar life of turpitude (remember the &#8216;waitress sandwich&rsquo;?).  The hostile elites could have ended his career via the MSM after Chapaquiddick, but didn&rsquo;t (there are speculations he was threatened with blackmail, the hostile elites certainly had enough dirt on him to destroy him). </p>
<p>Ted Kennedy, of course, was the Front Man for the 1965 immigration flood bill that has effectively destroyed this country.</p>
<p>I came across this quote and this is the perfect spot for it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the American people have seen is this incredible disparity in which those people who had cars and money got out and those people who were impoverished died.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &mdash;  Ted Kennedy on Hurricane Katrina</p>
<p>Comment:</p>
<p>&#8216;Ditto&rsquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Mary Jo Kopechne</p>
<p>As many other posters state:  Follow the money.  You can bet those who funded old Charlie&rsquo;s and Ted&rsquo;s licentiousness in exchange for Congressional votes are stone-cold sober in their focus and drive.</p>
<p>Bon <br>
