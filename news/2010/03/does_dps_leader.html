<h1>Does DPS Leader&rsquo;s Writing Send Wrong Message?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Berman, Detroit News, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The president of the Detroit school board, Otis Mathis, is waging a legal battle to steer the academic future of 90,000 children, in the nation&rsquo;s lowest-achieving big city district.</p>
<p>He also acknowledges he has difficulty composing a coherent English sentence. Here&rsquo;s a sample from an e-mail he sent to friends and supporters on Sunday night, uncorrected for errors of spelling, grammar, punctuation and usage. It begins:</p>
<p>If you saw Sunday&rsquo;s Free Press that shown Robert Bobb the emergency financial manager for Detroit Public Schools, move Mark Twain to Boynton which have three times the number seats then students and was one of the reason&rsquo;s he gave for closing school to many empty seats.</p>
<p>The rest of the e-mail, and others that Mathis has written, demonstrate what one of his school board colleagues describes, carefully, as &#8220;his communication issues.&#8221; But if these deficits have limited Mathis, as he admits they have, they have not stopped him from graduating from high school and college. In January, his peers elected him president by a 10-1 vote over Tyrone Winfrey, a University of Michigan academic officer.</p>
<p>{snip} His college degree was held up for more than a decade because he repeatedly failed an English proficiency exam then required for graduation at Wayne State University.</p>
<p>In another city, these revelations might be grounds for disqualification. But Mathis is liked and defended by many of his peers, who cite his collegiality, lack of defensiveness and leadership as more important than his writing skills. Even Winfrey, his defeated rival for the presidency, declined to criticize his qualifications.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is Mathis a success story? {snip} Or is he an example of the system&rsquo;s worst failings  &mdash;  a disinterested student who always found ways to graduate, even when he didn&rsquo;t meet the requirements  &mdash;  likely to perpetuate lax academic standards if the board wins its court battle with Bobb over control?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Another e-mail</b></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another mass e-mail from Mathis, from Aug. 11, 2009:</p>
<p>Do DPS control the Foundation or outside group? If an outside group control the foundation, then what is DPS Board row with selection of is director? Our we mixing DPS and None DPS row&rsquo;s, and who is the watch dog?</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him just last week that he should have his e-mails read by somebody before he sends them out,&#8221; said fellow school board member LaMar Lemmons Jr., who praises Mathis as a leader he can trust.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;If somebody gets ahold of this, it will become an issue that you can&rsquo;t read or write. It will go around the world.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Can Mathis read?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can read. I&rsquo;m capable of reading a lot of information and regurgitation,&#8221; says Mathis, who told me he sometimes needs to read documents two or three times to fully comprehend their contents but then masters  &mdash;  and memorizes  &mdash;  them.</p>
<p><b>Engaging and honest</b></p>
<p>Mathis is an engaging man. When I asked him about the grammatical deficiencies in his e-mails, he didn&rsquo;t waffle or grandstand, instead honestly answering questions about his difficulties in school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mathis and another student unsuccessfully challenged the use of an English proficiency test as a requirement for graduation. In 1992, when the case went to trial, the lawsuit gained national attention. Mathis said then his failure to pass the test &#8220;made me feel stupid.&#8221; The requirement was eventually dropped in 2007, and Mathis applied to get his degree the next year, after his election.</p>
<p><b>Understands struggling kids</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his career, Mathis has compensated for his rudimentary writing skills by seeking help from others and working on his listening and speech skills. &#8220;We picked him (to be president) because we thought he has the intelligence for it and the tolerance for disruptive behavior,&#8221; says Reverend David Murray. &#8220;He has that type of calm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it absurd for a man who cannot write a simple English sentence to serve as the board president? Or to lead the elected board of a district that ranks at the nation&rsquo;s bottom for literacy?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mathis and some of his supporters say his story is about someone who manages his limitations, just as others manage physical disabilities.</p>

		<p>A shining example for the youths of the Detroit School system. Ask Mathis whats the last (or any) book he read. No one can be that poor at writing if they can read at a 4th grade level. We learn how to write by reading what others write.</p>
<p>A man who won&rsquo;t read is worse off than one who can&rsquo;t read. </p>

		<p>I remember a regular poster here named Proactive had some horror stories about black students at Wayne State, which I think he said was his alma mater.  Was this lawsuit mentioned in this article the same lawsuit you mentioned about black students suing the school?  I remember he also said something about there being an easy essay requirement for all prospective graduates.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the perfect example of the norm in the black America that blacks believe should come about.</p>
<p>The end result, with these kinds of norms prevalent everywhere, are shown to us by the failed African states that are disintegrating right now and by Detroit and other black run cities.</p>
<p>That blacks believe they could run everything as it is now tells us how ignorant and incapable they really are. </p>

		<p>This is just another example of racist Whites trying to keep People of Color down.  Each person and each race brings something different to the table.  Just because President Mathis possesses a different skill-set than a White person is no reason to disrespect him.  </p>
<p>We are all different and diverse.  Do people forget that Diversity is Our Greatest Streng?  African-Americans bring different ideas to the the table, and White people have to get used to it. </p>
<p>The reason Detroit schools have a problem is the stingy funding from the State and Federal Government.  If they would give Detroit more money, Detroit could close the so-called &#8220;academic-gap.&#8221; </p>

		<p>A few years ago the New York Post printed several letters from NYC school teachers. The letters revealed a pathetic level of literacy. Many letters were obviously written by Blacks that could barely string to words together. <br>
How did Otis manage to get to such a position without actually writing anything? Maybe all his college work was &#8216;ghost written&rsquo; by another student. </p>

		<p>I guess you don&rsquo;t have to make this kind of stuff up. It would be a perfect story line for a TV comedy series or movie. What a pity that liberals and PC types have no sense of humor. Blacks can be awfully funny when they are not so damned dangerous.</p>

The Blacks will continue to be under achievers until the whites admit that blacks simply lack the intellectual capacity to compete; the Black struggle will indeed be more pronounced if the whites fail to edify them about their cultural disparity as well.<br>

		<p>Good greif. How embarrassing. This goes far beyond grammar and spelling. This man is unable to write a coherent sentence, never mind punctuation. I can&rsquo;t even understand what in the world he is talking about in these e mails. My 3rd grader can do better, and I&rsquo;m not necessarily being condescending, it&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>We had parent&rsquo;s night at the High School my daughter will be attending in the Fall, and the staff went on and on about how important it was for Freshmen to start off on the right foot, because HS transcripts are so vital on college applications. Are they sure? Will it even matter that she will be taking honor classes in English, Science AND Math? From the looks of this article, ANYBODY can get a degree, deserving or not. But who am I kidding, my daughter is WHITE, so of course her GPA will matter.</p>

		<p>I am not going to kill this guy for his lack of literacy.  He&rsquo;s not blaming whitey. He&rsquo;s not blaming the system. He&rsquo;s not blamming whitey&rsquo;s system.  Undoubtedly he could do so in Detroit and find a comfortable ideological home.</p>
<p>I once worked with a man whose reading skills were on par with this guy&rsquo;s and whose writing was worse, but he compensated in ways that allowed him to be quite successful.  It&rsquo;s a legitimate question to ask if, with his shortcomings, Mathis should be leading a school board, but I am going to err on the side of saying that he should be judged on what his ideas and accomplishments are on the board, not his remarkably poor grammar and diction, which be&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>A bigger question to me is how he graduated from college (I&rsquo;m not talking about the literacy test; how did he pass his classes?).  Not everyone is cut out for college, for reasons that are many, and I certainly am in line with orthodox Amren thinking about inherent group differences and how they manifest themselves academically, which seems to be the case here.  He may be the greatest school board member ever, but didn&rsquo;t he have to write papers at Wayne State?  How do you show leadership in a term paper?  It&rsquo;s an embarrassment to that school more than to Detroit School Board. <br>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;m stunned that he was denied a diploma from an American college for 10 years, considering he is black. Still, if he is &#8220;grammatically challenged&#8221;, how was it that he was awarded a diploma at all??</p>

		<p>Mathis seems to have a deficit in his ability to read that is uncorrelated to his intelligence. This is unfortunate for him, but no sane school system would allow him to graduate with other than a technical diploma. This training would have enabled Mathis to be a productive member of society.</p>
<p>I often discussed schooling with immigrants from India and China. They indicated that greater proficiency in English than Mathis demonstrates, was required to graduate even from their high schools. <br>

<p>Seriously though, I don&rsquo;t suppose his grammatical skills are as important as his leadership skills, provided his ideas are translated by a ghost writer before reaching his outbox. Unfortunately this is very common amongst many Blacks: failing at some academic requirement, then subsequently questioning whether the requirement itself is justified and reasonable. At least he doesn&rsquo;t appear to blame his limitation on anyone else. The real concern here is that he &#8220;[understands] struggling kids&#8221;, which in itself may be another way to say that he will not expect much of them.</p>

		<p>We are judging this man through White eyes.  However, for Blacks, where style is more important that substance (except for sports), Mr. Mathis meets all the qualifications: </p>
<p>1) He is Black.<br>
2) He looks good in a suit.<br>
3) He can write about as well as an average African-American.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the problem?  The people of Detroit like him.  If Blacks want him as the President of the Detroit School Board, then, I have no problem with that.</p>

		<p>At one time, high schools were viewed as serious academic institutions. Today, the standards have been reduced to the point where many people graduate high school without being able to read, write, or do simple math. Also, the high schools are notoriously dangerous. It&rsquo;s getting just as bad with the colleges. The fact that a semi-literate man of any color can get a college degree shows how the standards are also going down there, and it&rsquo;s not fair on the high school and college students who study hard to get their degrees, as the value of those degrees keeps going down. Plus, the colleges are also becoming dangerous. I once spent a year living on campus at the University of Memphis. The dorm was so overrun with tough blacks that it was like living in the ghetto, with rap music pounding into the night and extremely loud communication.   </p>

		<p>An Atlanta tv station recently was &#8216;fortunate&rsquo; enough to replace a morning weather caster with one of those well-edumacated blacks who can conversate with the best of them: several times I have heard him say it would be &#8216;more cooler&rsquo; or &#8216;more warmer&rsquo; in the morning, and he &#8216;axes&rsquo; questions, then launches into bits of &#8216;afro&rsquo; gestures and babble. I wonder if they get through meteorology school the same way they get through any other school. Perhaps he, too, attended Wayne State.</p>

		<p>       This gentleman was on Fox News and was ask to give an explanation. He claims to have A Learning disability that makes him unable to discern sentence structure. I have no knowledge of this, maybe some of the other readers can explain it. I can say his verbal skills are no better. He claims to have above average math skills having taught algebra and higher math courses. I would like to see his credentials posted . He probably be down with numbers I mean after all did not all math begin in Africa . Those Greeks they all be thieves, they probably be all black anyway.<br>
        All the great  breakthroughs in math have come from Blacks (John Nash was A Black African) All other mathematicians<br>

<p>  Unfortunately, what you say is true at most institutions of higher learning. Some poorly educated blacks can learn to write with practice, but many seem hopeless cases. Many cash-strapped colleges will accept anyone these days.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity:</p>
<p>Good memory.  Wayne State University in Detroit is my alma mater, and I remember well the lawsuit some black students brought against the university in regard to the essay requirement for graduation.  </p>
<p>It was a very simple assignment:  </p>
<p>Write an essay of a few hundred words demonstrating capability to express oneself in writing standard English.  All you had to do is select a topic from several hundred choices, and then write the essay using an opening, a main body, and a closing.  A fundamental ability in grammer, spelling, punctuation, and semantics was the only thing required. </p>
<p>It seems like this was too much for a large group of black students because they failed the exercise time and again.  When one considers that Wayne bent over backwards for blacks even back then, failure in the essay requirement took a considerable amount of stupidity. </p>
<p>And when one considers the primary black majors such as sociology, social work, parks and recreation (really), and teaching, to fail this part of the BA degree was hilariously shameful.  Then again, one has to respect oneself and the authority in charge in order to feel a healthy shame that compels one to overcome common difficulties and then learn. </p>
<p>They sued and lost. It&rsquo;s that simple. That anyone would sign on to sue the school over something as simple as writing an essay would be an embarrassment to just about any culture, but not blacks. </p>
<p>Wayne State has always had affirmative action, even back then, but it has become a major employer of blacks in Detroit so AA is an expected practice and priviledge for blacks. Today, Wayne could be called &#8220;Karl Marx University&#8221; where most of the major administrative posts are held by blacks, and if they aren&rsquo;t department heads, they are token &#8220;vice&#8221; chairpersons.  </p>
<p>That said, it is very accurate to say that if a black enrolls today and that, with little, if any, academic review, he or she is all but guaranteed a degree.  They&rsquo;ll get the sheepskin just by showing up. Anything less, as the administration sees it, would be &#8220;rasis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Detroit is a seemingly endless tragic comedy.    </p>

<p>He said he &#8220;taught algebra&#8221; and all those &#8220;higher math courses.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s the scam   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s called course title inflation.  Algebra or trig or geometry are just the names on the transcript.  No actual algebra or trig or geometry is being taught or learned.  Oprah (of all people) exposed course title inflation, when she took a young black woman, a high school senior, supposedly getting an A in her &#8220;trig&#8221; class in an inner city Chicago school, out to a DuPage County almost all white school and put her in a trig class there.  She said that she had no idea what was being taught, even though she was getting an A in trig.</p>

<p>Du Page county is right next to Cook county. In Cook county about 70 % of the schools fail, fail defined as 50 % of the students reading below grade aveage. In Du Page county, right next door, ZERO schools fail. NOT just near ZERO percentage, but ZERO of the schools. NOT ONE fails. NOW, ask yourself why that is, and the answer is NOT funding or money!!</p>

		<p>I graduated from City College of NY in 1981. One of the requirements was that you had to pass an essay test. We had three topics to choose from. As I was looking them over, one of them stood out and the thought crossed my mind that a lot of the students wouldn&rsquo;t be able understand it. Mind you, we were all seniors who had completed all of our course requirements. However, this was after open admissions went into effect.</p>
<p>Well, I was right. It was, &#8220;Think about something that evokes nostalgia and write about it.&#8221; I heard a rustling of papers and whispers. Finally, the proctor, who is supposed to keep his mouth shut and just make sure nobody cheats, said that he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to do this, but he needed to define the words &#8220;evoke&#8221; and &#8220;nostalgia.&#8221; Gee, how do you get to be a senior without having ever encountered those words?</p>
<p>As far as the easy majors versus the harder majors, at the graduation cermeony they had the students of each major stand up as they were called. They called my major, Biology, and we were all White except for one Black girl who was one of the talented tenth. They called Sociology and they were almost all Black.</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the picture.</p>

		<p>Next time I&rsquo;m in such a position where I am obliged to read resumes, I will take note of the colleges the applicant says he/she attended and if appropriate, will post those college names. I would also agree with some posters that Mr. Mathis is at least, not blaming his grammatical shortcomings on White racissssm or slavery. Perhaps he can, in fact, do some good there.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the problem? The people of Detroit like him. If Blacks want him as the President of the Detroit School Board, then, I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem either but as a metro Detroit resident I pay for these incompetents. We are hit in our county, state and federal taxes to fund Detroit. </p>

		<p>Wow.  Wow.  Truly, I&rsquo;m floored by this.  I share the sentiments of everyone else who has posted.  However, maybe this guy does have a legitimate learning disability.  I&rsquo;m assuming that if he does, he would have used it as an excuse by now, but still.  I guess I&rsquo;m just so incredulous by the emails that I&rsquo;d like to believe its the result of a learning disability, instead of just pure, unadulterated stupidity/laziness.  </p>

		<p>Otis Mathis is in good company: this black teacher tried to pay <br>
a WHITE HOMELESS MAN to take his teacher&rsquo;s certification test <br>
for him. </p>
<p><b>SCHOOLHOUSE CROCK. <br>
PROBE: TEACHER COULDN&rsquo;T PASS N.Y. EXAM <br>
SO PAID MAN $2 TO TAKE IT</b></p>
<p><i>Wednesday, March 23th 2005&hellip;</i></p>
<p>A BRONX TEACHER WHO repeatedly flunked his state certification exam paid a formerly homeless man with a developmental disorder $2 to take the test for him, authorities said yesterday.</p>
<p>The illegal stand-in - who looks nothing like teacher Wayne Brightly - not only passed the high-stakes test, he scored so much better than the teacher had previously that the state knew something was wrong, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pressured into it. He threatened me,&#8221; the bogus test-taker Rubin Leitner told the Daily News yesterday after Special Schools Investigator Richard Condon revealed the scam.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave him my all,&#8221; said Leitner, 58, who suffers from Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, a disorder similar to autism. &#8220;He gave me what he thought I was worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brightly, 38, a teacher at one of the city&rsquo;s worst schools, Middle School 142, allegedly concocted the plot to swap identities with Leitner last summer. If he failed the state exam again, <b>Brightly risked losing his $59,000-a-year job.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m tired of taking this test and failing,&#8221; Brightly told Leitner, according to Condon&rsquo;s probe. &#8220;I want you to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Along with being much smarter than Brightly, Leitner is 20 years older. He also is white and overweight while Brightly is black and thin. Yet none of those glaring differences apparently worried Brightly.</b></p>
<p>&#8220;He said no one would ever know,&#8221; Leitner said outside the Brownsville, Brooklyn, building he has called home since briefly living on the streets.</p>
<p>The two men met years ago at Brooklyn College where Leitner earned bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in history in the late 1970s, and Brightly got a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1992. After meeting in the alumni office, Leitner began tutoring the teacher as he struggled to pass the state exam, officials said.</p>
<p>But the relationship took a bizarre turn just weeks before the test last July, authorities said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got tired of flunking it,&#8221; said Leitner. &#8220;That was the thing that sparked this desperate act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brightly allegedly helped Leitner obtain a counterfeit state identification card that showed Leitner&rsquo;s photo with Brightly&rsquo;s name. Using the bogus ID, the pair conned city educrats into issuing Leitner a school ID card to use on test day, authorities said.</p>
<p>On July 17, Brightly allegedly picked up Leitner at his home and drove him to Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, where the test was given. The teacher allegedly came back after the test was over and drove Leitner back home, officials said.</p>
<p>After the exam, the state began investigating Brightly&rsquo;s passing score. He sent Leitner to meet with officials, and Leitner claimed to be Brightly - but the ruse failed, authorities said.</p>
<p>When The News went to Brightly&rsquo;s Mount Vernon home yesterday, a man who strongly resembled him insisted Leitner took the test on his own. The man, who appeared to be in his late 30s, denied being Brightly - saying he was the teacher&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Brightly has been charged with coercion, falsifying business records and other crimes. He has been taken out of his Baychester classroom pending the outcome of the case&hellip;</p>

		<p>I live in California, graduated from UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley (law school) and assure you that many educational and government institutions are full of blacks (and to a slightly lesser extent, chicanos) who are hardly better than the illiterate Mr. Mathis.</p>
<p>In high school (Palo Alto) the school, for political correctness, hired incompetent black teachers. The school district also set up a program where blacks from nearby East Palo Alto, which the blacks called &#8220;Nairobi,&#8221; fraudulently attended my high school as Palo Alto residents. These blacks performed far below the school&rsquo;s standards, when they bothered to attend class at all, and made a nuisance of themselves in a dozen ways. E.g., arson, assaults on white students, and demanding segregated bathrooms. The school district hired a black &#8220;multi-cultural program coordinator&#8221; who was a jumped-up race hustler with a history of problems at previous jobs, and of course he caused an infinite amount of mischief. Some years later, the school district, obsessed with hiring blacks, employed a black administrator at my school who was a low-life idiot.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, 1969-1973, the blacks were the bottom of the barrel. As an informal tutor,I helped some of them with their writing, but that was like putting a band-aid on a cancer. However, as long as they avoided science and math classes, it was virtually impossible for a minority student to flunk out. At a friend&rsquo;s school, San Jose State University, the blacks were also wretched students, even in the garbage fields they gravitated to, such as black studies, where rapping took the place of serious academic work. There was a unique black studies professor, Harry Edwards (of Olympic raised fist protest fame)who was respected by white professors and hated and avoided by black students,and harassed by black administrators. Why? Because he actually required serious work.</p>
<p>At law school, UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Boalt Hall,from 1983 to 1986, the blacks were at the bottom of the class, and in a more honestly run school, most would have flunked out. Almost every single black was admitted with qualifications far below those of any white student. (I&rsquo;ve seen the numbers.) The school changed the grading system a few years before I attended, to conceal the fact that blacks were all at the bottom of the class. (Got rid of the bottom 10% grade of &#8220;low pass&#8221; so that every student from the 1st percentile to the 75th percentile got an identical &#8220;pass.&#8221;)There was a first year tutoring program limited to blacks and hispanics which not only coached the minorities on how to take essay exams but degenerated into giving away the test questions in advance! (Complaints and threats of a lawsuit closed down the worst of the abuses.) The prestigious student-run California Law Review admitted whites on the basis of a legal writing competition, but set aside places for favored minorities. The situation was similar at other UC law schools. </p>
<p>A lawsuit some years later demonstrated that there were fewer than 200 total black or hispanic applicants in the whole country, legitimately qualified for the top ten law schools. However, with every law school desperate for blacks and hispanics, you can imagine how far down into the barrel the schools were ready to reach, in order to achieve their numbers.</p>
<p>The tough California Bar Exam, however, separated wheat from chaff. Blacks, even at the UC schools and Stanford, flunked in scandalous numbers. Two years before I started law school, almost every single black flunked. The response from minorities has been to charge that the California Bar Exam is &#8220;racist&#8221; and puts over-emphasis on reading comprehension and writing skills.</p>
<p>In my professional work, I have had countless dealings with government employees, even in high positions, who were hopelessly stupid but in their positions because they were black. </p>
<p>By the way, the next time you choose a doctor, think about this. At several well-known medical schools attended by friends of mine, the assignments were different for white students and blacks. The teacher would give the whites their assignment, then the blacks would hang around a few minutes and get theirs. A friend of mine, a medical school professor in northern California, told me the blacks were hopeless but it &#8220;took an act of Congress to give one a failing grade&#8221; and teachers would be harassed for trying to do so.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even get me started on today&rsquo;s minority school teachers and overpaid administrators. I live in Los Angeles and am familiar with the LA, Glendale and other school districts&hellip;</p>
