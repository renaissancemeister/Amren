			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>N.C. Aizenman and Spencer S. Hsu, Washington Post, March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leaders of nearly a dozen grass-roots immigrant rights groups excoriated President Obama and congressional Democrats on Monday, accusing them of moving too slowly to legalize the status of undocumented immigrants and citing a record number of deportations in 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our community is angry. Our members feel betrayed,&#8221; said Brent Wilkes, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens. &#8220;We never believed in our wildest dreams that President Obama would have a record like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Advocates have promised to bring tens of thousands of demonstrators to Washington for a March 21 protest and to punish Democrats at the polls in November if an immigration bill is not brought to a vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;No legalization. No reelection,&#8221; Emma Lozano, executive director of the Chicago-based Centro Sin Fronteras, told reporters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration advocates in Washington and lobbyists working with the two senators [.Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.)] said privately that the effort amounts to political damage control.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just don&rsquo;t see how this can happen in 2010. The best we can do is to get an outline [of a bill] out and have a couple of hearings,&#8221; said one lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing talks. &#8220;This is a way for everyone to say, &#8216;We are doing something, and we are committed to getting something through Congress after the election.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A legislative show is not going to be acceptable,&#8221; he [Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum] said. &#8220;The necessity here is a bipartisan piece of legislation that gets to the Senate floor, and that will be the marker that immigrant voters and others will use in November 2010 and November 2012 and beyond.&#8221;</p>

Music to my ears. If the &#8220;Centro without Borders&#8221; can help get rid of Obama, maybe we can get rid of them somewhere along the way. How can anyone be so obtuse as to encourage legislation that would not only legalize millions of people (and all the taxpayer goodies it provides), but also inevitably bring in millions and millions of their dependents. How?? Perhaps this can be done on the tail of health care legislation to make sure we go completely bankrupt.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty conceited of you.  Even in Presidential elections, when more Hispanics vote, they&rsquo;re still not a huge part of the electorate on a national basis.  And in mid-terms, Hispanics don&rsquo;t vote as much.</p>
<p>The dirty little secret is that even if a formal amnesty doesn&rsquo;t happen, refusal to enforce immigration law is essentially the same thing as amnesty.  And it won&rsquo;t raise the same kind of conservative ire as would actually pushing for amnesty.</p>

<p>If there is proof positive that these people want nothing to do with their new country and prefer to reject assimilation in favor of their old customs, traditions, culture and language, it is their desire to bring in, by any means necessary, their own people and retain their language, culture, traditions and language.  That most of these people sneaked into the country illegally bothers them not one iota. </p>
<p>Only the fools in the beltway and other politicians around the country aren&rsquo;t bothered by this, because they&rsquo;re completely out-of-touch with the real world and have lived a privileged existence for so long they have absolutely no idea why the majority of citizens want this amnesty debacle stopped in its tracks right now. </p>
<p>The country is imploding right now and will be unable to weather this ongoing economic storm precisely because it is NOT homogeneous.  It is in fact so overwhelmed with so many tribal factions it is no longer a nation of people, but the same boarding house T. Roosevelt warned about that amounts to a contentious mass of disagreeing rabble.</p>

		<p>The arrogance of these  people know no bounds. The whole idea behind amnesty for illegal aliens is that we need these workers. Well we have no work for them. They really do not care. They know they can always go on welfare and food stamps if there is no work.I know a few non-white immigrants who seem to also find Hispanic immigrants contemptible. They are proud of the fact that they can assimilate and do productive work.</p>

<p>I have news for her, the vast majority do not want amnesty. How arrogant and self-centered of these people to think that they have the right to walk across a border, break the laws of another country and be legalized because THEY want to. Oh,  also her organization &#8220;Center Without Borders&#8221;, does this go both ways? Let&rsquo;s say she got her way, ok would Americans and others who walk across the Mexican border automatically be allowed to legally stay there?</p>

		<p>No legalization and no reelection&hellip; Perfect!  At least as a start anyway.  Unfortunately, I believe the die is already cast for the future of America.  I predict a race-based &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; political party will emerge in the not too distant future, followed by increased demands for autonomy in the South-west.  Once the South-west returns to Mexico, I imagine we&rsquo;ll see the rise of Black Nationalism in the former slave states of the South.  It may take a few decades to occur, but on our current path, I believe that&rsquo;s where we are headed.  The precursor to those events, is that we have chosen to leave our borders wide open while reducing our native born (White) population; Actions which if continued, will bring about the end of America.  In the meantime, we get to hear and see the persistent and even increasing demands from &#8220;immigrant voters&#8221;.</p>

		<p>ROOT OF ALL USA&rsquo;S PROBLEMS:  A MISTAKE IN THE CONSTITUTION.<br>
SOLUTION:  NATIONAL REFERENDA</p>
<p>	Allowing such massive immigration has made America, in my mind, a most evil nation.  And American politicians who allow such rampage against their own nation could be viewed as the biggest mother-selling criminals ever in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>When you see our &#8220;representatives&#8221; (who are our servants) constantly on a warpath against us, selling off our nation through amnesty and the alien invasion, and we have to meekly beg our servants to stop their war on our nation, we know something is clearly wrong with our system.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are no binding national referenda in the United States.  Many other countries have it, but not the US.  Therefore America&rsquo;s secret shame is that we do not have a real democracy!  That is why American democracy is a joke.  </p>
<p>The constitution gave all the power to the 3 branches of govt. and assumed they will keep an eye on each other (&#8220;checks and balances&#8221;).    The three branches have become corrupt, usurped power, and all three branches figured out that it is better to conspire, mug and terrorize the nation and totally ignore the owners, the US Citizens.  To keep ultimate power in the hands of the people, the founding fathers put in the second amendment.  The second amendment, which assumed that millions of armed citizens can easily ouster an illegal and anarchist govt. with equally armed thousands of soldiers, is effete because modern armies have weapons that can kill thousands at a time, so the people will be crushed  in any violent uprising against a criminal government.  </p>
<p>So they keep passing evil laws the against our country, the public and against our will.  </p>
<p>	But there is a solution to this govt&rsquo;s war on the nation.  It is a constitutional amendment to allow national referenda, so people can pass good laws in the national interest themselves. These laws will supersede laws passed by Congress and cannot be overturned except on constitutional grounds by a supermajority of both houses and unanimous vote of the Supreme Court.  The people can then still pass it by 66% vote.   Some believe that this right to amend the constitution is inherently vested in the American public.  Others suggest an actual amendment.</p>
<p>We can pass a national referendum, to, say, ban immigration or limit bailouts, etc.  We will solve 90% of our problems this way.</p>
<p>  For eg., see:</p>
<p>http://ni4d.us/index.htm  <br>
<a href="http://www.iandrinstitute.org/National%20I&amp;R.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iandrinstitute.org/National%20I&R.htm;</a></p>
<p>We Americans need to call radio talk shows, etc. and promote this idea and get the process started soon, before America is thrown into the funeral pyre by alienist politicians.<br>

		<p>Hispanics are  largely a genetically arrogant, chauvanistic people. (Not every one, of course, but it is as broadly recognizeable a trait as Jewish thrift and dollar-sesse, or  Chinese circiumspection, or of WASP work ethics).<br>
 As to this spokeseoman&rsquo;s obscene rant, it is no surprise, and they, as a group, are capable of the most shameless affrontery. </p>
<p>Go ahead mz whats-your name (and who cares!); spout off like a loud and brainless idiot. You are showing white Americans what you truly are. You will pave the way for you and your conspititors, right back to Mezstizoland. Next stop, Juarez!</p>

<p>Not in my opinion.  The real reason, as I see it, is to reward criminality and give the Dems lock on their majority at the Federal level (as if illegals don&rsquo;t vote already, I know&hellip;) They would also get easier access to goverment freebies, like you said they already do, plus affirmative action as a protected class (oppressed minority) in jobs and education.</p>
<p>That aside, we need more &#8220;workers&#8221; now like a hole in the head.  Right here, in the county I live in, we have about 12% of the officially counted workforce out of a job. However, the traitors amongst us keep hiring illegals in construction and public works, hotels, retail stores, etc., just to save a buck, while ruining this country. I see mestizos, most likely illegals, all the time at the grocery and discount stores.</p>
<p>As a side note, now that I mentioned &#8220;mestizos&#8221;, isn&rsquo;t it funny that some illegal supporters say &#8220;go back to Europe&#8221;, when, if they are mestizos, they are part European themselves? I guess they&rsquo;ll have to deport their Spanish or whatever side and leave the rest here.</p>

		<p>I believe we must stop any form of amnesty at all costs or lose this Nation for good, but much of the damage has been done in the form of anchors. In my area many of the anchor kids are in their teens already and the women who are here illegally have as many kids as possible as soon as possible because they know it is the best assurance of not being deported. Until we change this, it is a certainty that they will be the majority in no time.</p>

		<p>This is not the same country who won WWII.  We have NO spine right now.  Parasite invaders enter our country illegally then make demands for citizenship and God knows what else.  Not that long ago they would have been considered enemy combatants. Despicable.  Everyday we fight for socialized health care gives them more leverage to make such demands.  As far as the invaders are concerned, this whole health care ordeal is FOR THEM.  It probably is.  We need to get some spine.  Yes WE.  We can elect our &#8220;leaders.&#8221;  We are the ones sitting back and letting it happen.  We are still a pretty large group, capable of moving mountains.  We are smart, strong, and hopefully still have the guts to act.  We are also the ones who need to get very angry before we act.  Aren&rsquo;t we there yet?  How tightly do we need to shoved into a corner before WE pounce?  God help you illegally ivading parasites once the lid finally blows off the pressure cooker.  You have no clue.</p>

		<p>It seems to me to be very shrewd political maneuver, the Democrats have been getting trounced lately and a crushing political defeat in the 2010 congressional elections is virtually guaranteed. </p>
<p>By taking credit ahead of time for the Democrats&rsquo; 2010 downfall, the illegal immigrant lobby hopes to bestow upon themselves undeserved political clout and create the appearance they are the king makers which all democrats have to bow down to.</p>

		<p>This is basically good news.<br>
Perhaps now our elected politicians, particularly the Republicans, will come to realize that they can&rsquo;t please everyone or take certain votes for granted. Most of all, perhaps they&rsquo;ll realize that voters who strongly oppose &#8220;diversity&#8221; among immigrants outnumber those who favor it.</p>

<p>&gt; I agree with you on the first part, but I disagree with the second part.  Illegals and even legal Hispanics have been receiving the equivalent of socialized medicine and other social benefits all along.  It has been demonstrated that an official single payer program would actually make this delivery cheaper.  However, I am with everyone who recognizes that open borders, and/or an active immigration standard would cause any form of health care based on taxes paid by citizens will always break the system.  It has already broken the system we have.  What they are going to have to face is that no one will end up with affordable care if we cannot contain the population that pays for and recieves the services.  However, a health care system that exists for profits for investors is only interested in providing less care for more profit and that means insuring people with fewer problems.  This is ethically and morally wrong, even evil.  Profiting on human pain and loss is evil, period.  (This is not to say that health care providers should not make a good living for the education required and difficult work they do, it means investors in health care corporations, set up for public offering for profit taking). This entire nation is growing more unhealthy by the day, including and especially the youth, due mostly to increasing obesity.  Where would anyone imagine this is leading?</p>
