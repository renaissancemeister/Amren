<h1>Supervisors Escalate Fight About Sanctuary Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Sherbert, San Francisco Examiner, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>City supervisors on Thursday publicly blasted the Juvenile Probation Department chief for refusing to change his policies of reporting to immigration authorities undocumented youths who have been arrested on suspicion of felonies.</p>
<p>During the Board of Supervisors Rules Committee meeting, Supervisor David Campos put William Siffermann, chief of the Juvenile Probation Department, in the hot seat, questioning him for violating The City&rsquo;s recently amended sanctuary law, and saying the department&rsquo;s current policies are an open invitation for racial profiling.</p>
<p>{snip} But Siffermann remained unwavering in his position that the department would be violating federal law if it shielded undocumented youths who had been arrested. He said that in May 2008, federal authorities detained probation officers, interrogated them and threatened to charge them for not reporting undocumented youths that had been arrested.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney general has since convened a federal grand jury, and that investigation is still pending, Siffermann told supervisors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July 2008, Mayor Gavin Newsom implemented the sanctuary law, which required probation officers to report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement undocumented youths who had been arrested on suspicion of a felony. In November, supervisors amended that ordinance so probation officers could only report undocumented youths when they had been convicted of a felony.</p>
<p>Newsom issued a statement Thursday reiterating his stance.</p>

		<p>The San Francisco Board of Stuporvisors, led by the amnestied illegal alien Reconquista champion Campos, slapped the widow of the three slain Bolognas with the worst insult that they could have possibly have created.They passed legislation that assured that what happened to them would happen again for the same reason,namely if an illegal is arrested, ICE will not be informed UNTIL there is a Felony conviction(which could take years).Mayor Newsom, who because he is running for higher offices, and for no other reason,will not enforce this measure.</p>

		<p>William Siffermann is on firm ground.  Especially after the tragic murders of an innocent family by a gang-banger Criminal Illegal Alien armed with a AK 47. Edwin Ramos gunned down an innocent father and his two sons.<br>
 San Francisco had refused to hand Ramos over to ICE after being caught in illegal activities at least two earlier times<br>
before the murders.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;City supervisors on Thursday publicly blasted the Juvenile Probation Department chief for refusing to change his policies of reporting to immigration authorities undocumented youths who have been arrested on suspicion of felonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is my &ldquo;Dream&rdquo; translation of that nonsense:</p>
<p>&lsquo;City supervisors on Thursday publicly indicated that treason charges against the Juvenile Probation Department chief for refusing to normalize his policies of reporting to invader and anti-terrorism authorities the dangerous presence of unwanted alien youths who have been arrested on suspicion of felonies, or worse&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>You get my drift&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.?</p>
<p>Change a few words, correctly document facts, and then act&hellip;</p>
<p>Problems of &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; idiocy and outright treachery can become something of a &ldquo;scandal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh my Toto&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Mexicans, Haitians, and Somalis&hellip;&hellip;.Oh my&hellip;.????</p>
<p>Indeed!!!!!</p>
<p>What more to say; oh, I know, God help us all!</p>
<p>Just a preeminent SCTV (or CCCP1) joke here my friends:</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it for Sifferman!  I used to live in the Bay Area, about 30 years ago, and it was even then a breeding ground for extremist liberals.  I am delighted to be OUT of there and in the sticks of the Inland Empire.  We&rsquo;ve got tons of illegals here, but nobody&rsquo;s shielding them from being reported if they are convicted of felonies.  San Francisco is an insane place - it epitomizes Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s ideals.  Stay away - don&rsquo;t reward them with your tourist dollars!</p>

		<p>Right, Siffermann realizes that not complying with the law places himself in jeopardy. If one of these miscreants is released and commits another crime and someone is injured, he could be subject to civil suit from various parties for not taking action and helping to establish a climate.</p>
<p>That does not even include following federal law. To not follow federal law is bad enough in itself. A civil suit in court in much more personal too.</p>
<p>There was the case a long time ago now where Mayor Feinstein [now Senator] insructed the coroner to teach the gay men of SF how to torture without killing the other person. The coroner refused, and for good reason.</p>
