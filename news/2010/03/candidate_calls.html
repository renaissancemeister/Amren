<h1>Candidate Calls Obama &#8216;Buckwheat&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Just News (Pembroke Park, Florida), March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Buckwheat, the Little Rascal from the 1920s series of film shorts called &#8220;Our Gang,&#8221; is now center stage in a foot-in-mouth moment for a South Florida candidate for the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Corey Poitier, who is running for U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek&rsquo;s seat, delivered a passionate speech against the health care reform bill Monday night to Broward County Republicans. During the speech, Poitier addressed the President by saying &#8220;Listen up, Buckwheat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t meaning him any harm. Maybe it was a little insensitive,&#8221; Poitier said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a term that my brother and I use. It was kind of a way of saying, &#8216;dummy,&rsquo; like when I say to my brother, &#8216;Hey, Buckwheat, cut that out.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poitier admitted that the comment was not very respectful, but he insisted it was not racial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&rsquo;t you be a bit even more sensitive to racial terms or even the perception of a racial term because you are a black man?&#8221; Local 10&rsquo;s Glenna Milberg asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that we have become so racially sensitive that anything can be set off,&#8221; Poitier said.</p>
<p>Students in Poitier&rsquo;s government class at North Miami Beach Senior High School invoked his First Amendment right to free speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Poitier is the only Republican so far in the race for District 17, where 57 percent of constituents are black and where nine out of 10 voters cast their votes for Obama.</p>

		<p>Well, I hope Poitier wins.  Not because of this remark, but for the prospect that a black conservative is thumbing his nose at the marxist in chief. Good on him!<br>
But it is a sad note for whites. Here we are posting anonymously at AmRen, fearing being outed as realistic whites -or nonwhites, who are totally fed up with the obvious upending and destruction of Western culture. Few of us have any real racial animus. I get angry and fed up when I see the news that AmRen posts&hellip;because nobody I know even hear of this stuff, and few really care&hellip;they&rsquo;re zombies. So I vent. That&rsquo;s it. But in truth, I respect that every human being (save for violent criminals) deserves to be free, healthy, and live long. I wish harm on no one.<br>
 We realistic whites just want to live our lives the way we were raised&hellip;free, peaceful, neither hating or hurting anyone, exploiting no one, living out the birthright given to us, paid for in the blood sweat and tears of millions of our forebears, God rest their souls.<br>
And only a black man can dare utter what Poitier said. They&rsquo;re just words, but words are a crime today.<br>
Land of the free? I think not.</p>

That&rsquo;s just wrong.</p>
<p>Buckwheat was black. President Obama is a mulatto.</p>

That reminds me of something that happened at a job I used to have.</p>
<p>This older gruff guy used to call everyone Buckwheat.  It was an blue collar job, so not a lot of office decorum.  Anyway, one day he called a black guy Buckwheat.  Guy went ballistic and made a big stink about it.  Everyone (including the black guy) knew he didn&rsquo;t mean anything by it.  But the black guy just HAD to walk around with that chip on his shoulder and make everyone uncomfortable.</p>

		<p>I knew the man who was &#8220;Buckwheat&#8221; in the Our Gang comedies; he was a dignified man who most people addressed as &#8220;Father Bob.&#8221;  He was an unselfish and kind man who turned his life around in a 12-Step program.  He died several years back, and there were hundreds at his funeral.  I was proud to have known him.</p>

		<p>Yes, I observe balcks as too racially sensitive.  I learned to call classmates by name and treat everyone equally until other races always pointing out race, making race comments ( especially always asking me about color) Other races really do have different cultures and behaviors. This is why like minded people are usually of same race. This is perfectluy natural until it is used for political advantage.  It is wrong to make white people responsible for other groups. Every group needs to take responsibility for their existence within the law.  V</p>
