			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon L. Peters, USA Today, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tiny birds seem to be the next, albeit improbable, wave in fight-to-the-death blood sport.</p>
<p>Twice in recent months, authorities have raided operations where finches were kept to attack each other for onlookers who bet on which birds would survive the matches.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, authorities worry about public safety. &#8220;The individuals who enjoy this kind of brutality, who attend these fights should be regarded as very dangerous,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They&rsquo;re the same type of people who enjoy dog fighting and rooster fighting. There may be drugs or arms, and criminal backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increased public awareness and reporting have made dog and rooster fighting riskier, Rickey says. Finches are much cheaper to raise and keep, they&rsquo;re quieter, and they&rsquo;re easier to transport and secret away, he says.</p>
<p>Most of the birds seized in the busts in Shelton, Conn., and Ashland, Mass., were saffron finches, 6-inch songbirds indigenous to parts of South America, which sell for $120 and more a pair in the USA.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re aggressive when mating, Rickey says, and that&rsquo;s why bird fighters favor them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Connecticut raid last summer, 19 men were arrested and 150 birds seized. In Massachusetts last month, more than 20 finches were seized, and investigations into the 20 people living in the house continue.</p>
<p>Many of the people apprehended in both busts were Brazilians. Brazil has long had a culture of finch fighting, but the practice was outlawed two decades ago.</p>

		<p>Why are there any Brazilians in the U.S. to begin with?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that country having a boom cycle, lots of jobs, wealth being created, jobs for everyone? So I had thought.</p>
<p>Very nice climate, warm, sun, etc. NOT cold of the U.S. in the winter, etc.</p>
<p>I just do not understand it.</p>

		<p> Brazil has long had a culture of finch fighting, but the practice was outlawed two decades ago.</p>
<p>So were drugs,murder,smuggling, illegal entry into the country,theft of private property and prostitution. So what is the point of outlawing bird fighting when those people kill each other whole sale:) coming to a neighborHOOD near you soon.</p>

		<p>I appreciate Jeddermann&rsquo;s astute comment about Brazil&rsquo;s current economic prowess and his questioning why a Brazilian would even be in the economically diminishing U.S.  However, then I remember that it was relative to Rio de Janiero that I first heard of the crime of car-jacking at urban street corners, and it is in the cities of Brazil where there are hordes of homeless children that the POLICE kill each night as if they were exterminating rats or wild dogs (but this is supposed to be a &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; unmentionable).  Brazil has a huge wealth/poverty gap and beyond such beauties as &#8220;Ipanema Beach&#8221; (&#8220;where the women sway like wind in the banana trees&#8221;, to quote one of my favorite singers, MIchael Franks), the cities are groaning with impoverished favelas that are more like what you would expect to find in Haiti than in an glittering South American powerhouse.  And, for me, the final killer, the country is basically Marxist.</p>
