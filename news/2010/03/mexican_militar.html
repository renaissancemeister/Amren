<h1><a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/state/Mexican_military_helicopter_seen_over_US_home.html">Mexican Military Copter over US Neighborhood</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Brezosky and Gary Martin, San Antonio Express-News, March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Zapata County sheriff Thursday was questioning why a Mexican military helicopter was hovering over homes on the Texas side of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>It was one of the more jarring incidents of the fourth week of border tensions sparked by drug killings, and rumors of such killings, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez said he&rsquo;d reviewed photos of the chopper flown by armed personnel Tuesday over a residential area known as Falcon Heights-Falcon Village near the binational Falcon Lake, just south of the Starr-Zapata county line. He said the helicopter appeared to have the insignia of the Mexican navy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s always been said that the Mexican military does in fact &hellip; that there have been incursions,&#8221; Gonzalez said. &#8220;But this is not New Mexico or Arizona. Here we&rsquo;ve got a river; there&rsquo;s a boundary line. And then of course having Falcon Lake, Falcon Dam, it&rsquo;s a lot wider. It&rsquo;s not just a trickle of a river, it&rsquo;s an actual dam. You know where the boundary&rsquo;s at.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sighting came amid ongoing fighting between the Gulf Cartel and its former enforcers, Los Zetas. The mounting death toll and crisis of fear in cities across from the Texas border have drawn global attention, as has a news blackout in affected cities due to the kidnappings of eight Mexican journalists, at least one of whom was killed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gonzalez, the Zapata sheriff, said he couldn&rsquo;t confirm reports that the helicopter was scoping out the home of a drug criminal. He said the incursion about a mile over the border took place over a neighborhood populated by many U.S. Customs officers who work at area border crossings  &mdash;  and that they knew what they were seeing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My understanding is the U.S. military were informed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know what action was taken, if any.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Why would they care about a border that they don`t recognize anyways?  I lived in Mexico, and along the border most of my adult life; then, I found that race was a tangible concept.     </p>
<p>Listen, I`ve stood in front of elementary schools in Oaxaca State-where they marched like little nazis in the playground with chants of Mexican nationalisim-of thier stolen homeland- from the evil, white-gringo-monster.  That, White, blue-eyed-devil they would say.</p>
<p>We as Whites must stop fighting one another and unite; or, It`s over-wherever are new borders are drawn. I look forward to the day of White, racial solidarity if that`s even possible.</p>

		<p>The chopper should be forced to land at a US airfield and the pilot arrested for failing to file a flight plan.  The Sheriff can take up a Federal Marshal who has the authority to order the Mexican National chopper to land and submit to a records check.  Or, the territory can be ceded to Mexico.</p>

		<p>The areas where these helicopters flew over are for all intents and purposes a part of Mexico anyway.  Virtually all the people are Hispanic, every public sign is in Spanish.  The people in those counties can vote in Mexican elections.  The helicopters flew over these areas because that&rsquo;s where Mexican drug gangs are operating.  The helicopters are just indicative of symbolic reconquista.  Everything is Mexico save the welfare checks.  &#8220;Where there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.&#8221;   &mdash;   Vincente Fox.  </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been said that the Mexican military does in fact &hellip; that there have been incursions,&rdquo; Gonzalez said. &ldquo;But this is not New Mexico or Arizona. Here we&rsquo;ve got a river; there&rsquo;s a boundary line.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>What about that precious virtual fence?  The truth of the matter is that the border should be obvious even if it&rsquo;s not a water border.  That it is not is the problem.</p>

		<p>There was another interesting story in the Express-News the other day. It was that the State of Texas wants to lower or eliminate fines for DWI offenders who are &#8220;low-income&#8221;. Even my spouse saw the injustice in that one.</p>

		<p>Imagine if Iran had flown a copter across the border with Iraq or Afghanistan   &mdash;   All of Washington would be in an up-roar!  Obama and the War Cabinet would be meeting in the War Room, we&rsquo;d be at Defcom 10, and rushing additional aircraft carriers, nuclear subs, and stealth bombers to the Middle East.  </p>
<p>But, protecting those borders are of vital interest to the USA, unlike our own border.  </p>

<p>I agree Gay Racist</p>
<p>We seem to have so many different factions with different beliefs. I sincerely wish we would all get on the same page. I really wish we as whites who understand the truth about why race matetrs would put all intolerance aside when dealing with each other. I respect any of my own people who fight for what is right for us as a people. We have every right to determine our own fate as a people and we certainly do not need it determined for us as is being done.<br>

<p>They probably did file a flight plan, it is just that our government is mostly hispanic and black now that no one cares.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incorrect to call this a &#8220;US neighborhood.&#8221; The border between the US and Mexico may be a solid line on the map, but in reality it has become a shifting and poorly-defined frontier zone. All that territory is up for grabs and Mexico&rsquo;s winning by sheer force of numbers. Waves of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are followed by military incursions and the spreading influence of the Mexican Narcostate. After a certain point, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if both countries still officially recognize the land as &#8220;US territory.&#8221; That&rsquo;s just a legal fiction. In the real world, the map is not the territory. </p>

		<p>All they had to claim was they were operating under the command of interpol, now that our king has decreed them the ultimate authority. PS#6 One needs to be very careful with whom they decide to align themself. Discrimination in all things is merely common sense, and a necessary fact of life.  For instance let us say a dog defecated in your plate would you eat it?</p>

		<p>Definitely not cool for the Mexican military to be flying over U.S. soil, unless there is some kind of understanding between our two governments. That being said, these cartels are REALLY bad news for our cities that are close to the border. If we can take care of them by working with the Mexican government, I am all for that.</p>

		<p>Strange is it not? Mexican peasants did what the Soviet Red Army, the Third Reich German Wehrmacht and the Imperial Japanese Army could not do. All those armies were far far far more capable than any army the Mexicans are capable of creating. In the same way, the British fought like lions against Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s war machine only to meekly give up their island to muslims, blacks and hindus. None of these people have it in them to conquer Britain militarily. We live in a crazy world.</p>

You have that correct.  I know my father and his generation are rolling in their graves.  He and a lot of my relatives have fought long battles for this country to remain safe and all it took was a fifth column to rot us from the inside.  They have been cheated for all their sacrifice as this country was so easily discarded on the heap of multiculturalism and ultimately, marxism.  If enough of us were able to we could win it back but certainly not without a major battle.  And while we sit and contemplate what to do, they are corroding every institution in this country from its religions to the military.  And as Bill Clinton so proudly announced, &#8220;By 2050 this will no longer be a white country&#8221;.  So little time left.</p>
