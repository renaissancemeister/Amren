<h1><a href="https://sarahmaidofalbion.blogspot.com/2010/02/deadly-dream-of-uhuru.html">The Deadly Dream of Uhuru</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>"Sarah Maid of Albion," Sarah&rsquo;s Albion Blog, February 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 1950&rsquo;s the word Uhuru, meaning &#8220;Freedom&#8221; in Swahili, became synonymous with what is still portrayed as the Mau Mau struggle against white Colonial rule in Kenya. Meanwhile, in the present day the Uhuru movement is a black power movement in America, whilst Black Uhuru is a Jamaican reggae band.</p>
<p>Uhuru is a word which the liberals like to associate with black freedom fighters rising up against white oppression, or which they use to evoke images of a rich African culture usually to the backing chants of village children or some lilting and sanitised voice of ethnic African revolution, such as the late Miriam Makeba</p>
<p>However, for anyone who has studied the so called struggle for freedom in Kenya and the activities of the Communist inspired Mau Mau the word has far more sinister connotations. The barbarity and cruelty practised by the Mau Mau was an early example of the daily routine sadism and savagery we now see across Africa and reveal quite how outrageous and dishonest the case currently being brought by one-time Mau Mau terrorists against the British government, over alleged torture, actually is.</p>
<p>As with the so called anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa the Mau Mau killed, maimed and tortured many hundreds and possibly thousands more Africans than they did whites. Estimates vary as to how many of the peaceful majority of black Africans were killed by the mau mau between the official figure of 1,800 and up to 30,000, most of the killings being marked by the extreme levels of violence and cruelty involved. In particular the wives and children of non mau mau linked Kikuyu who were serving in the army or police force were targeted and slaughtered in significant numbers.</p>
<p>Only 32 white settlers were killed by the terrorists, however, many of these murders were extraordinarily cruel and violent.</p>
<p>The Ruck family, including their six year old son Michael, being a horrific example, the little boy was dispatched in his bedroom, amongst his toys, by a group of men wielding machetes. His pregnant mother Dr. Esmee Ruck, who had spent years nursing African children, had the unborn foetus literally ripped from her belly, whilst Roger Ruck was hacked to bits attempting to defend his wife and son.</p>
<p>Neither sex nor age led anyone to be spared the killing of Dorothy Bruxner-Randall in March 1954 was followed swiftly by that of four year old Andrew Stephens, hacked to death with a panga in April 1954 and 83 year old Dr Charles Pentreath who died in a similar manner a fortnight later.</p>
<p>Another truly horrific killing was that of Arundell Gray Leakey, brother of Victoria Cross recipient Nigel Gray Leakey, and cousin of anthropologist Louis Leakey, who, after being forced to watch the murder of his wife Mary, was taken on a forced march to the foot of Mount Kenya, where the Kikuyu believe their god Ngai lives, disembowelled and then burred upside down and alive. The killing was allegedly ordered by a witch doctor on the grounds that the gods required the blood of a White man.</p>
<p>The cruelty and blood lust of the mau mau, and that which occurred in the Belgian Congo a decade later, were a foretaste of the horrors which have been visited upon the white population of South Africa in the 15 years since the end of the much reviled but, by comparison, relatively bloodless Apartheid. An aptitude for cruelty is nothing new in Africa, it has lurked at its dark heart for many centuries.</p>
<p>However, have we in fact only seen the beginning of the horror in store for Africa, and beyond. There are rumours that there is far more to come, and again that blood stained word, Uhuru, makes its unwelcome appearance.</p>
<p>Many people in the white SA community believe Uhuru to be a codename for a plan to commit mass genocide against whites when Mandela dies. In part this belief is due to the fact that in 1990. when Nelson Mandela was set free the liberal&rsquo;s favourite ethnic songbird Miriam Makeba released a song titled &#8220;Not yet Uhuru&#8221;. What did she mean and when will be Uhuru?</p>
<p>In 2004, when rumours spread that Mandela was in poor health, following the sudden cancellation of a scheduled meeting between him and the then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, reports claimed that plans are being made by the nation&rsquo;s Communist Party to slaughter all whites in the country in the event that the old man died.</p>
<p>Further reports at the time claimed that that thousands of armed black men were prepared to descend on the main cities such as Johannesburg and Durban to attack whites.</p>
<p>In addition to Uhuru, the alleged plans are variously dubbed &#8220;Operation Vula,&#8221; &#8220;Night of the Long Knives,&#8221; &#8220;Operation White Clean-up,&#8221; &#8220;Operation Iron Eagle&#8221; and even bizarrely enough &#8220;Red October campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was said that under a further name Operation &#8220;Our Rainy Day&#8221; was to be carried out after the death of Nelson Mandela and would involve a &#8220;take over&#8221; of fuel points and various strategic locations and the wholesale massacre of whites. The attacks would lead to a coup and the forming of an all black South Africa.</p>
<p>Of course Mandela did not die and, for his age remains surprisingly robust. However, the rumour persists that the plan is still in place, and that most blacks in the country are aware of that plan. I am told that when racial disputes occur, blacks often tell whites, &#8220;Wait until Mandela dies.&#8221; and they mean it</p>
<p>So what are we to make of this? Does Operation Uhuru exist only in the understandably paranoid nightmares of South African whites, or is there really a plan in place for the day when that most beatified of retired terrorists has his final meeting with Beelzebub?</p>

<p><i>His pregnant mother Dr. Esmee Ruck, who had spent years nursing African children</i></p>

<p>Blacks say a lot of things; they may mean them, but not in the sense a white man would.</p>

		<p>The cruelty, torture and inhumanity described above can be seen, to some extent, in the crimes comitted by blacks here in the US.  For example, have you ever seen a white criminal beat on an elderly person who is incapable of putting up any resistance at all?  Well, we&rsquo;ve seen videos of just that kind of viciousness and the perps are always black.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also seen other videos where black mobs are beating a lone white kid and we&rsquo;ve read numerous reports of black on white beatings, murders, tortures and killings that were unnecessarily cruel.</p>
<p>While other races have their incidents of mayhem and torture, none have the numbers involved as blacks do.  Nor are these pathologies so common among their ranks as with blacks.</p>

		<p>If an undefinable number (15%? 25%-who could tell?) of African indigenes believe there to be a plan,and are prepared to unleash mayhem,then it follows that there doesn&rsquo;t really need to be a plan.</p>
<p>All it would take is one or two murders,and the propensity of the indigene for mindless violence would do the rest. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not paranioa when they really are out to get you, and apparently, SA blacks are out for whites for real. The only problem, other that mass murder, of course, is that if it happens, the country will decend even more into spiritual darkness, and probably physical darkness too, as the blacks alone probably won&rsquo;t even be able to manage to keep the electrical power plants operating, among other things.</p>
<p>I like that final statement about Mandela meeting the devil.  Nice touch.</p>

		<p>I am surprized that not all white south africans have not left the country. Unfortuntately, all the hard work that they and their ancestors have done, will go to nought. I wonder if they will qualify as refugees if the black war against them goes on? These folks would make the ideal refugees, they are skilled and many of them already speak English and would be an asset to any country that accepts them as immigrants.</p>

		<p>I often wonder why any whites would stay in SA.  It is hard leaving your homeland.  But I have heard first hand experiences from white SA professionals that it is difficult to immigrate to America and even Canada.  Of course we all know that both countries are on a bent to achieve a high third world population.  You know, put those whites in their place.  Anyway, even with the murders, cruelty, and degradation, whites there are like us here, we sort of close our eyes to what is happening, because it will happen to the other guy.  Whatever the case, America, watch closely SA for that is our fate too.</p>

		<p>Mau Mau is a Kenyan group that existed before the Independence in the 1940&rsquo;s to 50&rsquo;s by only THE KIKUYU TRIBE to protest an ILLEGAL HUT TAX that the British imposed on the Sons of the land. It was the era of TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. And the last time I checked, when WHITE AMERICANS WERE FACED WITH A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES they eventually drove off the British in what I think is called &#8221; Revolutionary War&#8221;.  All other tribes of Kenya including Kikuyus who did not practice violent resistance against whites. In fact there was no &#8221; Ethnic Cleansing &#8221; of whites in Kenya as Whites still live and own farms that their colonial forefathers had when they &#8221; STOLE&#8221; land from gullible Africans who have since forgiven and accepted these descendants of White people.<br>
 Most Kenyan tribes sought peaceful means to advocate their positions such as Kavirondo Tax Payers Associations. Kenya African National Union which lead to the formation of the LANCASTER HOUSE Meeting whereby they all United to Petition the British Govt for Independence. In fact Independence was granted smoothly Two years after Africans were allowed to vote and had a Prime Minister.<br>
Kenya is and has always been a place of peace and harmony for people of many Nations. In fact there is a burgeoining Italian colony in the Kenyan Coastal town called Malindi where retiring Italians mix and mingle with the locals without a hint of malice!</p>
<p>The atrocities committed in South Africa Congo  and other African countries are not related anyways to the Mau Mau or the Kenya struggle for Independence.</p>
<p>You might as well be talking about the Spanish Inquisition as being a European thing and not a Spanish thing.</p>
<p>Love your blog but had to point out your innaccuracies!</p>

		<p>they will kill all of the whites, just like the haitians did to the white french. anytime there is a mjority of blacks in a country, the whites will eventually be killed. blacks are the most racist people on earth. their whole existence is about their blackness. just look at all the black writers and newpaper people. every article is about their blackness, no other subject ever. they want to talk about their blackness and want you to discuss their blackness 24 hours a day. whites will have to man-up eventually, or perish.</p>

		<p>Some years ago I viewed the film, Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika).  It is the story of a Jewish couple who leaves Nazi Germany for Kenya.  The wife is horrified to immigrate to a backward land and leave civilized Berlin.  In time, their relatives in Germany disappear, while they adjust to life in east Africa.  At the end of WWII, they decide to return to Germany.  I found the movie distorted in a major way, for nowhere in the film does it hint that had they remained in Kenya that they might have been exterminated, not because they were Jews, but because they were white.  No hint in the film about how the Indians would later lose their property and rights in Kenya, and many of them had to leave east Africa also.<br>
Simply put, it is alright to condemn the Germans for killing minorities, but never mention how Africans kill and ethnically cleanse minorities.<br>

		<p>I suppose that there is an underground armed White resistance, awaiting this uhuru?  A dozen Blacks with machetes can be stopped easily with a single semi-auto weapon.  And whatever weapons the Black police and military might have, they&rsquo;re still dumb and they still depend on Whites to keep things running.  I recall how well into the 1980s, the French would send a couple hundred Foreign Legionaires into some African hellhole with every expectation of bringing them all back.  Or when we went into Somalia, and the helicopters got shot down by RPGs, we lost 18 infantrymen and killed over a thousand Somalis in return.  Armed Whites are extremely dangerous to Blacks.  I just don&rsquo;t see a successful overnight massacre.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate our white brothers and sisters in South Africa  &mdash;  their ancestors have been there for over 300 years, and they understand the situation very well. There are three times as many private security officers (heavily armed!) as there are government-funded police, there are thousands of gated communities, and most white folks are savvy with firearms. If you worry about white South Africa, why not join them! You can buy a wonderful house, have servants, and have wonderful friends, for about what it would take to retire in Florida. </p>

		<p>If one is a white South African, there are only two choices: flee while you can or stay and fight to the death. I would take the threat of the coming Operation Uhuru very seriously. Had I lived in South Africa, I would have left a long time ago. I have to assume that whites who still remain, can&rsquo;t leave due to finances or family issues. When Mandela finally does become close to death, the remaining whites should have been heavily armed, gathered at reinforced compounds, stored food &amp; water, and prepared an organized defense. Flee or fight? I say flee and live to fight another day. </p>

		<p>This is typical of the African mind-set.</p>
<p>Firstly, because they can not keep a secret and thus have already lost the element of surprise.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is always the &#8220;we&#8221;, because they hunt in packs (as they do over in the USofA).</p>
<p>Thirdly it exposes their primitive blood lust and total disregard for those who carry just about the entire tax burden.</p>
<p>Fouthly, it is as usual all talk and no do.</p>
<p>I have heard from some of my black employees that the day after the soccer world cup they are going to kill all foreign blacks (the MSM coined the phrase &#8216;xenophobia&rsquo; for this phenomenon which is in reality black-on-black racism, but we all know blacks can&rsquo;t be racist).</p>

		<p>After all the evidence of decline and lawlessness following the demise of white rule, many African blacks still are consumed by the same old magical thinking that guided their ancestors.  If they can just get rid of the whites (who run almost all of the continent&rsquo;s industry and business) blacks can move into their houses and offices, and everything will just keep running automatically.  With a populace with an average IQ of 70, the sub-Saharan will run about as well as a home for the mentally retarded running itself.  <br>
A few decades ago, people may have had reason to hope that European civilization and industrialization had taken enough hold in Africa to enable blacks to follow the lead.  But they can&rsquo;t, plain and simple.  Take the great black hope, SA.  Already it&rsquo;s headed by a king with several wives and a large brood of children, guided by a health minister who says tap water on the genitals will cure HIV.</p>

		<p>Shame on the European, Canadian, Australian and American governments for not taking in the whites of Zimbabwe and S. Africa if this ideology is true. There will be a special place in Hell for these people who turned their back on their oppressed white brothers and sisters in brutal dictatorial regimes like Mugabe&rsquo;s and Mandela&rsquo;s. If this is true, then the whites will have to take out as many colored and blacks in physical violence as they can. Maybe blacks from Europe will want to help in the racial cleansing, thus freeing up land in Europe so the whites could come back to their homeland, and the blacks to theirs. What a novel idea! </p>

		<p>I am a white and still living in South Africa. Some contributors have asked why there are still any whites here. There are several answers to this. One is that South Africa is 14 hours flying time away from the US, 11 hours from Europe and 8 hours from Australia. Contrary to popular belief, there is already a large, impoverished white underclass of approximately 1 million (i.e. 1 out of every 3 whites) who are simply unable to afford even a plane ticket out of here. For example, around the capital, Pretoria, alone, there are no fewer than 38 white Favelas, white squatter camps, where white people live in shacks, tents and hovels. </p>
<p>Many of these people have no professional qualifications or a college degree, and without these it is quite frankly impossible to emigrate to a country like the US, UK or Canada. I personally have relatives who are qualified tradespeople, e.g. electricians and such like, who have tried but failed to get permission to emigrate to Australia. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the unpalatable truth: it appears from here that the West would rather see their fellow whites massacred and would rather allow millions of Asians and Africans to immigrate, than South Africa&rsquo;s whites.</p>
<p>A sobering question to consider - let&rsquo;s say the Night of the Long Knives comes for us here in South Africa. Would the West grant refugee status to the white survivors like they did with the Vietnamese, or would political correctness make the West look away while the survivors are murdered too?</p>

		<p>Anton is quite correct. But even with a professional qualification it is difficult, near impossible to get out, if you have reached your late 40&rsquo;s. And some of our background is very specialized and works only in a South African context. What position will a senior civil servant apply for overseas? Even for an IT qualification the globe has become tough, you need specialized skills and your kind of specialized skills might not be required overseas, they have enough unemployed of their own. There are all kinds of obstacles, e.g a divorced couple. One parent has the sense to emigrate, the other one not. Now it becomes a tug-of-war over visitation rights. </p>
<p>You start fighting against windmills.</p>
<p>How do you tell a black or liberal white judge and liberal white social worker and liberal white professor that this country is dangerous? People are so ignorant and naive and just don&rsquo;t want to know, and that keeps back some of the more intelligent. They think you are mad and have a psychological problem and need professional help.</p>

		<p>Anton says: <i>Many of these people have no professional qualifications or a college degree, and without these.</i></p>
<p>And without those I guess you&rsquo;ll just have to give up and die.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop Africans, or South Asians   &mdash;   or anybody really, EXCEPT whites.</p>
<p>Arm yourselves and WALK if you have to. In a big enough group for defense.</p>
<p>I understand that may sound harsh and unfair.</p>
<p>But life isn&rsquo;t fair. And it is absolutely NO use at all to complain about double standards.</p>

<p>I think we all know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Now forget about it. The question won&rsquo;t save you and yours.</p>
<p>ALL of you should get the HELL up and WALK.</p>
<p>Your exodus has gone largely unnoticed because YOU YOURSELVES have MADE it secret, departing by the handful.</p>
<p>Get even a hundred together to march into a neighboring state, on the way to, say, Spain, and you will be seen.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get that many together, in your dire straits, then maybe you DO deserve to die.</p>
<p>Maybe only 1/3rd or 1/4 of you make it. Too bad. Set out knowing many will die, but that the alternative is worse.</p>
<p>Do not waste breath telling the world why you can&rsquo;t. Nobody   &mdash;   and I mean NOBODY   &mdash;   cares.</p>
<p>Except a very, very few.</p>

<p>Careful planning not being a noted African trait, I don&rsquo;t imagine any such large-scale program has been set in motion, in preparation for the occasion of Mandela&rsquo;s eventual passing. But spontaneous and sporadic outbursts of anti-white violence wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all. </p>
<p>And if those &#8220;sporadic&#8221; events happened to achieve a certain momentum and spread township to township across SA, then you could indeed have an attempted genocide. An entirely unplanned uprising as dangerous as any organized &#8220;Operation Uhuru&#8221; could have been. </p>
<p>That some SA blacks will use the occasion of Mandela&rsquo;s death to harm some SA whites isn&rsquo;t hard to imagine. The only question is whether the spark will catch fire nationwide. My recommendation is that SA whites don&rsquo;t stick around long enough to find out, and should get out while the getting&rsquo;s good. </p>

<p>Our next neighboring state is Zimbabwe. Spain is more than 10 000 km away. First you have to cross darkest Africa, torn by civil war (the Dakar rally was shifted out of Africa recently). And cross the Sahara dessert.</p>

<p>  Anton, you are right but it&rsquo;s our ruling elites that feel that way not everyday white people. I would advise any white South African to immigrate to Western Europe either legally or illegally. It seems once you&rsquo;re on terra firma you&rsquo;ll never be deported  &mdash;  look at formerly Great Britain. Our global oriented, privileged elites have no racial allegiance what- so- ever. They only care about themselves and the minority under classes. </p>

		<p>Anton: I am quite sorry about your plight and the plight of others in South Africa. If I were in your shoes, I would take out a credit card. If necessary, I would max it out in order to get my family out of the country and I wouldn&rsquo;t look back. Come to America or wherever as a tourist and then establish a new identity. You simply disappear into your new country. There are many sparsely populated areas in the U.S., where a smart person could go unnoticed for a very long time. Illegals do it here in America every year by the hundreds of thousands. My guess is that you would find sympathetic whites who would be willing to assist you in sort of a modern day underground railroad. I wish you, your family and all white South Africans Gods protection over the next few years.</p>

		<p>Not that the prospect of genocide against SA whites isn&rsquo;t bad enough, here is another horrifying thought. I remember in the days leading up to the ending of Apartheid, how completely the whole world turned against the whites of SA.  In some quarters it was even suggested that the US used its military might to &#8220;persuade&#8221; SA whites to end apartheid. Now think of this possibility.  Blacks institute a genocide against SA whites and whites fight back.  Would our African Communist president and his leftist administration order America&rsquo;s military forces to attack the resisting whites, for instance using air strikes to bomb the victims of genocide?  And would the American military be willing to carry out such orders? </p>

		<p>Some musings:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to America or wherever as a tourist and then establish a new identity. You simply disappear into your new country&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not sure this will work. Sooner or later you will have to interact with the authorities, or your children will. You have to be able to open bank accounts, take children to the clinic, register as unemployed - too many things might go wrong. People will start talking.</p>
<p>Then again, we read one in eight people (some reports claim one in six, but never mind) in America are on meal tickets, and some alarming articles speak about a break-up of America into the state before it was an United America, i.e. when your founding fathers came to the shores of America. And that there is high unemployment. If all of a sudden 4 or 5 million whites arrive at your shores, won&rsquo;t that strain the social fabric - you yourselves have high unemployment. The same goes for Europe and the rest of the West. The West has a low growth percentage compared to the East, and that already for decades on end.   </p>
<p>&#8220;Would our African Communist president and his leftist administration order America&rsquo;s military forces to attack the resisting whites, for instance using air strikes to bomb the victims of genocide? And would the American military be willing to carry out such orders?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the big question. On the other hand, we understand America at present is so overextended in foreign wars that this would perhaps not realize.</p>
<p>Are the Americans still so influenced by anti-Apartheid propaganda and anti-white? </p>
<p>If not, then it will be difficult to exterminate a brother-race, the American soldier might refuse (just as it was a problem between East and West Germany before the fall of the wall), except if the Americans have been prepared by propaganda beforehand.</p>
<p>I also understand there are a lot of white mercenaries in your army, they were ex S.A.D.F. (the white South African Defense Force) soldiers trying to make a living after they were so shamefully dropped by our last liberal president. And some young foolish adventurers that are there for the money. They will also object. So this would not be so a simple thing anymore.  </p>

<p>It can be quite difficult to up and move a long distance when one has no money to move on. These White South Africans would have to cross several backwater African countries, many with young children. Where would they live or stay once they arrived at their destination with no money? Do you really think the USA,Canada, Europe or Australia would care about Whites? These people would likely be refused. Here in the USA, they only care if you are a  Mexican, if you&rsquo;re White, forget it. You can&rsquo;t blame White South Africans, blame other nations for not taking them in.</p>

		<p>Going by the AMREN comments, one can distinctly notice that the average American citizen, if enlightened about the true nature of South Africa, is benevolent towards us. After all, historically we all are Western European stock.</p>
<p>There is a lot of informing yet to be done.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a difference between what the politicians do and what the voters think.</p>
