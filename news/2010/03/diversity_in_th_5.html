<h1>Diversity in the Tech World</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Razib Khan, Gene Expression, March 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few weeks ago I had dinner and drinks with an old friend who works for the firm which invented the x86 series of microprocessors. He&rsquo;s doing well financially right now, and was very bullish on his firm. More specifically it seems that they&rsquo;re on a hiring binge (he knows because he&rsquo;s been on hiring committees). So a while back he forwarded a resume of a graduate school acquaintance to human resources. His boss came up to him later and told him that there were remunerative benefits to forwarding resumes. If the individual gets hired:</p>
<p>- There is a entry-level $2,000 bonus to the referrer</p>
<p>- But, if the hire is female, there is a $6,000 bonus to the referrer</p>
<p>- But, if the hire is an underrepresented minority, there is a $12,000 bonus to the referrer</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NSF has data from 2008 on doctoral recipients. 28% of recipients in the physical sciences were female, multiplying that out by the number of blacks, Hispanics and American Indians, I get 84 physical science doctorates to women who were are underrepresented minorities in 2008.<br>

		<p>I can tell you with complete earnestness that at the international corporation where my wife works (which is not a &#8220;tech firm&#8221;), the managers nevertheless get bonuses for putting &#8220;diverse&#8221; candidates into their departments. So, of course they are going to do it.</p>
<p>Of course, a White Christian is not diverse, neither is a White male libertarian. A White member of the Conservative Book Club had better not display his books.</p>
<p>They are merely putting in people of color to appease the present Marxist government (and the one before it, and the one before that). </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll keep what I have and hire legals of white skin and make certain that we hang together for a lifetime and create the best working environment for our pale brothers; right here in America. Not Amerika!! We need to bring back as much segregation as we can muster to save the white race that has brought the best living standards known to man. We don&rsquo;t need to do what South Africa has done and destroy a country.</p>

		<p>There is a pattern developing here.  The Federal Government is using ZIP codes to select applicants for jobs.  Federal agencies hiring seem to be selecting people who live in minority ZIP codes.  I was told by the Census that I was not qualified for hiring because they were not going to hire anyone from my ZIP code and I could not move to another.  Whites are being systematically excluded from jobs.</p>

		<p>Are they kidding? I work in the computer field. It&rsquo;s getting hard to find &#8220;non-minorities&#8221; at all. </p>
<p>However, since Asians are vastly overrepresented in the field, they have to specify &#8220;underrepresented&#8221; minorities.</p>
<p>If they mean who I think they mean, this is, in effect, the most anti-asian hiring practice around. Unless, of course, they mean to discriminate againt the dwindling number of whites who are in the computer business.</p>

		<p>Re #5 - I can only echo your comments.  The high-tech world is Indian and Chinese, hence the need for the word &#8220;underrepresented&#8221;, translated to mean black and Hispanic.  Look around in society, and gee, I wonder why they&rsquo;re underrepresented in high tech?</p>

		<p>I work in this industry and I can tell you that white people under 40 are scarce.  Almost all positions filled by younger people are Indian, with other races making up the balance.  The absence of white people annoys me, but the Indians work like mules, they work cheap, and they don&rsquo;t argue with the boss.  Management loves them.</p>
<p>But In my almost twenty years of experience in this field, I have only worked with one black who was anywhere close to competent.  Otherwise, blacks are propped up and celebrated for any accomplishment no matter how mediocre, while white people have to follow up after them and make things right; just like everywhere else in America. </p>

<p>$12,000 bonus&hellip;? What&rsquo;s funny is that the employer&rsquo;s these non-whites leave behind (leaving to take their new job), will then be scrambling to make up for the lack of non-white faces. In schools, neighborhoods, jobsites, and entire cities now, where seeing a white face is a rarity, there is no call to make sure that city &#8216;looks like the rest of America&rsquo; too.<br>

<p>If you look closer, it&rsquo;s the Liberal who gets the $12,000 bounty, and enough loot to move away from diversity. Multiculturalism does indeed work great, for liberals. </p>

<p>I echo your experience with blacks.  And the only competent one I knew was a mulatto.  However subservient the Indians are, they are notoriously uncreative.  Each and every project we sent to India was an unmitigated failure.  We wound up having to do the work over again in the US.  Sure, there are good ones, but nit nearly so many as the press would indicate.  For a manager, cheap labor is like crack cocaine.</p>

		<p> #7 Your first paragraph say&rsquo;s a lot as to one of the reasons for this. Americans have brought much of this on themselves. Modern day Americans black and white, for the most part believe the world owes them a living. They think manual labor is a mexican worker. Even though much of this is communist induced to destroy the country, I believe many in management would prefer these foreign invaders regardless of the damage to the country. Most brain washed people can&rsquo;t see far enough down the road to notice the cliff ahead. Those running the show can, and are trying to drive us over the edge to our impending doom.</p>

		<p>In these tough economic times, I find it hard to believe that they would actually come through with this pledge. I think their (company managers and upper management) motive is that they themselves would be amazed if a black or brown mestizo could perform the task. They are probably so confident that not one is out there that they put up thousands of dollars to prove them otherwise. In a sordid way, I&rsquo;d love to see these clowns actually have to pay up. But I don&rsquo;t think so. It is actually &#8220;covert&#8221; bigotry that these companies are promoting. Ironic, don&rsquo;t ya think?!!! </p>

<p>SRoNJ, I wonder if that has not spread to private business.  About a month ago I called a place about 180 miles away to see if I could get a truck driving job there. After identifying where I live, I was told that I &#8220;was not in their hiring area&#8221;. I said I was willing to commute, as a truck driving tour lasts 2-3 weeks normally, so there would be no daily commute, to no avail.</p>
<p>My town is mostly white, so I just wonder now&hellip;</p>

		<p>Here are a few recommendations I could give to AmRen members who are considering entering the industry, or have children or nephews or nieces about to enter the industry</p>
<p>1. <b>Do not apply for the positions where 1000 others applied for the past 24 hours.</b>  Of course, certainly possible you might be chosen out of a thousand applicants, but you really can&rsquo;t blame anyone if you happen not to be chosen for the position.  Please do not despise yourself, or despise the human resources department at the particular company, or humanity in general, if they happen not to choose the wonderful you out of 1K applicants.  I do know you are a very wonderful high tech developer.  Please understand it was nothing personal.  Google receives 1300 applications a day.  IBM can&rsquo;t afford to actually sit down and read each and every resume it receives.  I attended the information session held by IBM when they came over to our school, and they told me it keeps the resumes it receives in its database for two years, and if they need someone, they will search through the resumes to find the right developer for the job. </p>
<p>2. <b>Apply for jobs where few people have applied, or at least you feel the particular position would not have a lot of applicants.</b>  Do not let the position description fool you.  Many positions might have challenging, boring descriptions at the first glance, but if you read carefully, or actually do it, you will notice many of the responsibilities out there are surprisingly pleasant and easy to handle.  </p>
<p>3. <b>Do not let the salary the biggest factor in choosing the position.</b>  The higher the salary, the more the applicants(duh) and could also possibly mean the more unpleasant and physically and mentally stressful and demanding the responsibility will be at the position.  Do not be choosing a job simply because the particular job pays you 1 more dollar per hour than the job you truly enjoy.  A little bit more money should not be worth sacrificing your happiness.  And moreover, if you do not enjoy the job, you will not be as productive and creative as you want to be, or the dirty old man wants you to be, and they will not renew your contract after a year.    </p>
<p>4. <b>Apply for the particular sector where you are most talented in, and enjoy working at.</b>  To do that, first, you must spend a few weeks, or as long as you need, to realize which field in the high tech world you are most suitable for.  Take out a clean piece of paper, and write down which fields of high tech you found most enjoyable so far in your life.  And then, circle one, or two, or three of those you feel you are most talented in.  And there you go! these are the high tech fields you must actually find your career in.  Find positions where they need your type of developers (and as I stated shortly ago, do not pay too much attention to the salary) and write a very specific resume.  General resumes that you feel could be submitted to just about any high tech company, will not describe you adequately, correctly, or thoroughly enough.  And very specific resumes for very specific parts of high tech industry will describe you and your abilities very thoroughly and make you very attractive.  <b>Specific resumes for very specific sectors in the high tech are infinitely better than general, broad resumes that you wrote to be read by all high tech companies on the planet.</b></p>
<p>5. Your academic record, such as what school you studied at, or what your GPA was, does not matter much nowadays.  Just like any other field outside the computer industry, actual experience and &#8220;connections&#8221; truly helps.  I was offered a position once even before I finished schooling simply because I personally knew someone and her company was looking for someone.  </p>
<p>I was sometimes asked, &#8220;Are you a Computer Science person?&#8221; or &#8220;Are you an Information Technology person?&#8221; or &#8220;Are you a computer engineer?&#8221; and I could not give a clear answer.  computer science or information technology are too broad subjects.  That is like, asking an NHL player, &#8220;are you an athlete?&#8221; the answer could be yes, but that does not describe the player adequately enough.  </p>
<p>and I recently realized, the ideal description of me would be, &#8220;dynamic content developer/designer&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If any questions about what I stated above, any AmRen members are welcome to leave me a line here and ask!  </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t catch this part at first reading. I took the Census worker test maybe two months ago, getting 28 out of the 29 questions right. I haven&rsquo;t heard anything back from them other than, when I called to ask about when they are hiring, I was told it would be around the end of this month. Meanwhile, they are still testing applicants! (this has been going on for months.)</p>
<p>After reading SRoNJ&rsquo;s comment, I wonder if they are still testing because they don&rsquo;t have enough &#8220;underrepresented minorities&#8221; who made a minimally passing score. Most of the persons present when I tested for both the first test and the supervisor&rsquo;s test were Anglo whites.</p>

		<p>To Korean Guy:<br>
   I have to disagree with you re GPA and college quality.  Back around 1980, it seemed that only Bell Labs and the oil companies asked for one&rsquo;s grades.  This past decade, it&rsquo;s been the opposite.  Everybody and his brother asks for a transcript.  I&rsquo;ve been asked for grades within the past 3 years, even though my undergrad transcript is from 1981!!!  I&rsquo;ve also heard stories about students interviewing on-campus (i.e., the recruiter visits the campus to do interviews), where upon exiting the interview room, the interviewee gets handed a Transcript Release Form to sign  &mdash;  no escape if one has bad grades to hide!<br>
   I don&rsquo;t think Google gives much consideration to applicants from less-than-top schools.  There is a reason for this:  Google demands a certain fluency with abstraction.  Wonder how many of the 1300 applicants/day are aware their resumes aren&rsquo;t going to see life out of a wastebasket.  Wall Street quant employers are the same way, for the same reason.  <br>
   That said, there are exceptions, and yes one can be hired before one finishes one&rsquo;s degree, via connections (but don&rsquo;t let them find out if you&rsquo;re flunking out)).  HR departments in older companies e.g. Intel (the x86 manufacturer in the original article) may very well be under strong liberal influence and be actively looking for women and racial minorities  &mdash;  but don&rsquo;t assume there isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;floor&#8221; of credentials below which they won&rsquo;t go.  I&rsquo;m female and I know I won&rsquo;t get into Intel, as my grades were nothing great  &mdash;  even though I know employees there who would be just too glad to get a $6K bonus. <br>

<p>Thanks for your comment.  </p>
<p>The reason I stated #5 was because I saw, far too many times, people with less than beautiful GPA getting all those sweet positions,</p>
<p>whereas I also saw people with fantastic GPAs keep getting turned down for the positions they were applying at.  That includes East Asian males.    </p>
<p>the only explanation I could think of was their uncle or aunt was working for the company.  </p>
<p>I am predicting the GPA or the reputation of the school would be used as a final factor&hellip;. or a tiebreaker.  Maybe it differs among the countries, but if you want to hear about the situation near where I live, experience and connections truly triumph a little piece of paper with a few numbers and letters on.  </p>
<p>I also agree with the human resource departments paying less attention on the GPAs.  A few numbers or letters can never explain enough how much the person can contribute to the company.</p>

		<p>It is utterly incredible, how many white Americans, both male and female, have not the slightest idea how many laws have been written to &#8220;put them at the back of the line&#8221;, whether it&rsquo;s employment, contracts, education, etc. In fact, I&rsquo;ll go so far as to say that it&rsquo;s almost a crime against their families, their friends, and themselves, that millions of Americans of caucasian descent, are not aware of this. It should be elementary knowledge,so serious are the consequences of these laws for them. It&rsquo;s hands down racial discrimination.</p>
