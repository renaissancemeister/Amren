<h1>Class on Pa. Town&rsquo;s Immigration Fight Draws Fire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathy Matheson, Google News, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When David Lopez came to college in the big city, the immigration tensions in his small Pennsylvania hometown seemed a world away.</p>
<p>So he was surprised to find the discord had followed him 80 miles from Hazleton to Philadelphia. His community was being spotlighted in a Temple University class, &#8220;War in Hazleton: Main Street Meets the Global Village,&#8221; just four years after it became ground zero in the national debate on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The class has drawn the ire of Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta, who said he was never asked for any input or to address the students. Barletta, who blames an influx of illegal Hispanic immigrants for a deteriorating quality of life in the struggling former coal town, fears the class is unfairly portraying him as anti-immigrant and anti-Latino.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m surprised and bewildered how a taxpayer-funded school could offer a course without interviewing one of the main principles that the course deals with,&#8221; Barletta said this week. &#8220;There&rsquo;s no way that this course is not being slanted in one direction, which is unfortunate for the students, if that&rsquo;s the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barletta championed a law that targeted landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and businesses that employ them. The law, one of many enacted by local leaders who thought the federal government wasn&rsquo;t doing enough to combat illegal immigration, was thrown out in court. The city is appealing.</p>
<p>Professor Lori Zett said the class provides context, history and background to help students understand why illegal immigrants come to the U.S. It uses Barletta&rsquo;s law as a starting point to examine immigration policy, the global economy and Latin American culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The course was proposed last year by Zett and Temple professor Frank Leib, whose family has strong roots in Hazleton. Leib said he hoped the course would include field trips to his hometown, where students could walk the streets, talk with people and interview the mayor. Zett, who has taught the course for two semesters, said field trips were nixed because of logistics and finances.</p>
<p>The class does get first-person perspectives from students like Lopez and Kayla Hartz, both 18-year-old freshmen from Hazleton. They describe the town of 30,000 as bitterly divided over immigration, with no room for shades of gray; both said the class has opened their eyes to issues never discussed at home.</p>
<p>But Hartz feels some legitimate complaints about immigrant-related problems in Hazleton  &mdash;  such as overcrowded schools  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t get much support from Zett or other students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor also objected to an early course outline describing Hazleton as a Balkanized community filled &#8220;with a fierce mutual distrust.&#8221; That language is not in the current syllabus.</p>

		<p>The course content suggests that on the one side you have illegals, on the other you have Americans resisting them, and the compromise lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>There is no middle ground. Illegals are illegal.</p>

		<p>Two things you won&rsquo;t hear from this course:</p>
<p>(1)  When Lou Barletta ran for re-election in 2007 (?), he not only won his own party&rsquo;s nomination, the Republican Party, but he also won the Democrat Party nomination on the same day, with write-in votes, and with a big name former mayor on the ballot.  </p>
<p>(2)  He challenged Paul Kanjorski for Congress in PA-11, the district which encompasses Hazleton.  While Barletta lost 52-48, Obama beat McCain in PA-11 by 57-43.  Extrapolate that advantage to this election cycle (Barletta is running again), and he just might win this time around.</p>

		<p>Why is the mayor or anybody else surprised?  All public schools, public colleges, and ivy league colleges are nothing more than liberal/marxist indoctrination centers these days.  Have been for decades.  They don&rsquo;t even bother to make a pretense at objectivity now, though.  None whatsoever.<br>

<p>The students are being conditioned to despise Barletta (and all Whites) and everything he stands for  &mdash;  without hearing his side, of course. I suspect the monikers &#8216;White Supremacist&rsquo;, &#8216;Nazi&rsquo;, &#8216;Hater&rsquo; and &#8216;terrorist&rsquo; will be used freely in class to describe him.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The class does get first-person perspectives from students like Lopez and Kayla Hartz, both 18-year-old freshmen from Hazleton&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, of course!  To be &#8216;fair and balanced&rsquo;, two 18-year old experts on the impact of illegal immigration on small town America will be asked about their &#8216;perspectives.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>And that will be the final word from &#8216;the other side.&rsquo;  White residents of Hazelton who object to illegal immigrants destroying their beautiful town (and yes, I have been there several times, DH is from the Pennsylvania anthracite coal area, his parents are interred in the Hazelton cemetery) will be labeled as Hateful Nazis. DH speaks of past days when no one thought of locking the front door and keys were left in the ignitions of the car. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the REAL expert on the deleterious impact of illegal immigration in Hazelton, Mayor Barletta, won&rsquo;t be asked to give HIS perspective.  The mayor told CBS news:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&rsquo;When you start seeing serious crimes being committed, very violent crimes being committed and time and time again those involved are illegal aliens, it doesn&rsquo;t take a brain surgeon to figure out that you&rsquo;re experiencing a problem here that you&rsquo;ve never had before, nor do you have the resources to deal with it.</p>
<p>We arrested an illegal alien for selling crack cocaine on a playground. It took our detectives five hours to determine who he was. He had five different Social Security cards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The catalyst was two violent crimes involving illegal immigrants; a murder by two Dominican men, and a drive by shooting. The mayor claims that elderly residents are afraid to leave their homes, and constituents begged him do something.</p>
<p>The [police] department had exhausted its overtime budget for this year more than four months ago. </p>
<p>At the hospitals, un-reimbursed medical expenses for things like emergency room visits are up by 60 percent. Public school enrollments are up 25 percent. </p>
<p>And the budget for teaching English as a second language has gone from $500 a year to more than $875,000&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the facts he presents are non-PC and he is White so that makes him and his facts irrelevant.  </p>
<p>In the current PC Reign of Terror and War on Whites, no White town can be allowed to remain White.</p>

<p>Having grown up in Hazleton I thoroughly RESENT some 18 year old Hispanic claiming Hazleton as &#8220;his&#8221; hometown.  In 1992 there were barely any Hispanics in the city which means David moved here either after being born in New York/New Jersey to immigrant parents or he was born in a Third World country and moved here from New York/New Jersey.  Over the last 18 years Hazleton has totally deteriorated - overcrowded schools, increased traffic, increased crime, higher taxes, etc. - and going out anywhere in public all I see are Hispanics and hear nothing but Spanish.  It totally GALLS me being at the mall and hearing mom and dad speaking to their kids in Spanish knowing that MY taxes are going to have to pay for that kid&rsquo;s ESL classes while my son attends classes in a trailer because the school is overcrowed because of THEM! Legal or illegal it does not matter to me - they are not &#8220;immigrants&#8221; but are nothing more than invaders</p>

		<p>Anyone who has lived with Latino neighbors&hellip; can tell you from first-hand experience how they drive the quality of life DOWN for White neighbors.</p>
<p>We moved to Houston some thirty years ago. With very few illegal immigrants at the time. The the flood started. Crime rose in direct proportion. The quality of public school education took a nosedive   &mdash;   a teacher friend of ours can readily attest to that.</p>
<p>Demands on the welfare climbed, as did the numbers at local hospital ER facilities, demand (and getting free health care). Of course, the birth rate shot up, thanks to Anglos having to fund the illegals. </p>
<p>I could not agree more with Hazleton&rsquo;s stand on illegal immigration. If only more cities would follow their example.</p>

		<p>Just more of the &#8216;whites give up your land and country and be happy about it&rsquo; stuff.  People of like mind need to live together.  Diversity is okay if it&rsquo;s under 5-10%.  I am sure the people of any race or culture would agree when it&rsquo;s their own home turf in question.</p>

<p>I know someone who moved up here from El Paso.  She told me that people did not leave anything outside, not chairs, decorations or anything else as these would be stolen.  This lady said that she was so surprised when she moved here and saw that people were able to keep decorations outside of their home.</p>
