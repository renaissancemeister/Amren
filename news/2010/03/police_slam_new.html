<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A LIMIT on racial descriptions of criminals was putting political correctness before crime busting, police say.</p>
<p>Descriptions including Black African, Indian and Eastern European are among those dumped in media releases seeking crime suspects.</p>
<p>They have been replaced by four categories: Aboriginal, Caucasian, Asian and other.</p>
<p>Police Association secretary Greg Davies said it was putting unnecessary impediments in the way of catching criminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite silly and counter-productive and of no assistance to anybody to make everything vanilla,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not a matter of being racist, it is a matter of solving crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen-Sgt Davies said it should be about giving the public the best information possible. &#8220;It is political correctness taking precedence over solving crime,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have accurate descriptions of suspects if we are going to release information to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to make it as specific as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Commissioner Simon Overland said they tended to use broad categories of race when speaking to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have moved away from those terms because sometimes they can cause offence,&#8221; he said on radio.<br>

		<p>This appears to be an attempt to administratively de-classify white Australians as a distinct race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to make it as specific as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Distinct Asian sub-catagories: could be Lebanese, Arab, Chinese, Persian, Vietnamese, Indian-Pakistani, Filipino, or Indonesian.</p>
<p>Distinct &#8216;Other&rsquo; sub-catagories: could be Somali, Sudanese, sub-Saharan black, Hispanic, or Polynesian.</p>
<p>Whites stand alone. </p>
<p>By using the term &#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; to aggregate other light-skinned people with whites, the pro-diversity crowd has craftily undermined the uniqueness of the white Australian racial identity.</p>

		<p>For the life of me, I do not understand why any white cops even bother to try and solve crimes in the ghetto.  If they police as they should, they will be accussed of racism.  If they take a hands off approach, at least they won&rsquo;t be blamed for oppressing the bruthas.</p>
<p>Really, I have seen interviews with black folks who one minute decry police brutality and the next they are complaining that their neighborhoods are unsafe.  Which do you want it to be?</p>
<p>It is no solution merely to escape to a much safer white neighborhood because others like you will follow and soon turn the once pleasant &#8216;whiteopia&rsquo; into another ghetto.  When there are no more safe white neighborhoods and the entire nation is a big hellhole, who is going to pay the taxes for all your freebies?</p>

		<p>When I was an undergrad in a downtown Chicago school, 1990&rsquo;s or so, we would receive a weekly &#8220;crime report&#8221; for the safety of the students on who to look out for. As is usual in downtown Chicago all the street crime is committed by those of noble African ancestry. The reports would invariably read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stolen Purse on Division St., 10 pm. Suspect is an African American Male, 5&rsquo;11&#8221;, Red Hooded Sweat Shirt, Baggy Jeans, White Shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>One week I was surprised to find that the description of perps in the weekly emails for the monotonously same crimes were amended to:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stolen Purse on Division St., 10 pm. Suspect is a Male, 5&rsquo;11&#8221;, Red Hooded Sweat Shirt, Baggy Jeans, White Shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I then knew that the perp would be caught for sure, and I felt vastly safer with this newer and smarter identification system.<br>
Thanks, Higher Ed!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Attention all units: converge on 12th Ave and cambridge st; look out for armed rape-murder suspect. Suspect is &#8220;OTHER,&#8221; five feet five inches, 130 pounds. Good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t lump Lebanese, Arab and Persians into Asian category. Lebanese are Arabs at all. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest a distinct Middle Eastern or Euro-Caucasian/non-Euro Caucasian categories.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that in reading about crime or other social problems in the U.K. the term &#8220;Asian&#8221; is employed generally to refer to those of Pakistani origin.  Maybe in Britain, people just know who to look for with such a description, since there&rsquo;s so much Paki crime, but in the U.S. people would be on the watch for Orientals.  And in Australia, with its longtime Anglo-Celtic population, Middle Easterners and Slavs usually look different.  <br>
It&rsquo;s too bad liberal societies have given up terms like &#8220;colored&#8221;, which is much more descriptive of most American blacks than is &#8220;black&#8221;.  Of course, they&rsquo;re the ones who demanded the change.  The term &#8220;Asian&#8221; is especially problematic because there&rsquo;s a distinct difference between Orientals and Indians, for example.  But, then, if an American says &#8220;Indian&#8221;, someone may not know whether he means an East or American Indian!  </p>

		<p>This is just insanity. Of course the police want to get as accurate a description of the perpetrator of a crime as possible.</p>
<p>That is how it always has been. Standard police work. &#8220;A man did the crime&#8221;. Well, great, help us our here. Tall, short, fat, slim, hair, no hair, scar or no scar, limp or no limp, etc., OH, and what was his race??</p>
<p>Everyone that fits the description is a suspect. And everyone that does not fit the description is a suspect too. Don&rsquo;t try to narrow it down, that would be an effective management technique that might offend &#8220;someone&#8221;!</p>

		<p>&#8220;I was robbed!&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Describe the robber&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a human, about 5&rsquo; 9&#8221; tall, wearing blue jeans and a tee shirt&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Male or female? Oh wait we can&rsquo;t ask that. What race? Your choices are Aboriginal,Caucasian, Asian or Other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ummm, I guess Other&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will do our best ma&rsquo;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>You will notice the full description allowed, and no choice for the most likely race on there.</p>

		<p>I am amazed that people who are supposed to be adults are worried that they might &#8220;offend&#8221; someone.  Since when is &#8220;offending&#8221; someone a crime?  When someone chooses to be offended, it is just that - a choice.  Since I have no control over the choices you make, why should I be held responsible if you choose to be offended at something I say or do?  Isn&rsquo;t it time we all grew up?  I am 100% responsible for my every word, thought, and action - and you, likewise, are responsible for yours.  If we want to get along in this world, we have to become mature enough to not take offense at much of anything, since someone else&rsquo;s nasty words will redound upon them, not on us.  This PC that I&rsquo;m somehow responsible if you take offense should I pass gas, is ridiculous and needs to be wholly dropped.  Get over it.</p>

		<p>Even without a description, experience has taught us that our assumption of the offender&rsquo;s race is typically correct.</p>
