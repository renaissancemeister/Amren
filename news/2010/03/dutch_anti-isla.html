<h1><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6230AN20100304">Dutch Anti-Islam Leader Is Major Winner in Polls</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reed Stevenson and Aaron Gray-Block, Reuters, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dutch anti-Islamist leader Geert Wilders scored major gains in local authority polls Thursday, making him a serious challenger for power in a June national election, preliminary results showed.</p>
<p>In the first test of public opinion since the collapse of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende&rsquo;s coalition government last month, Wilders&rsquo;s Freedom Party (PVV) led in the city of Almere and was second in The Hague.</p>
<p>The results came on top of an opinion poll showing that the PVV, which campaigns against Muslim immigration as its main platform, would win the most seats  &mdash;  27 in the 150-member Dutch parliament  &mdash;  in the June 9 election.</p>
<p>That would make it tough for Balkenende&rsquo;s Christian Democrats, projected to win one seat less, to forge a strong coalition without Wilders. Months of talks between parties, and the resulting policy vacuum, could threaten a fragile economic recovery and cast doubt on the scope of planned budget cuts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The PVV has been pitching its policies to a nation of 16 million that is turning increasingly inward as the economy struggles and social tensions rise. There are nearly 1 million Muslims in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leftist elite still believes in multi-culturalism, coddling criminals, a European super-state and high taxes,&#8221; Wilders told cheering supporters at a rally in Almere after polling ended Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the rest of the Netherlands thinks differently. That silent majority now has a voice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wilders, who has faced death threats, was under tight security at his rally Wednesday.</p>
<p>People had to pass through metal detectors and security officers patted everyone down for concealed weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many Muslims who want to take part in the community, but there is a percentage who want to make problems,&#8221; said bus driver Theo Verstappen, 53.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who make problems are not being dealt with properly. It&rsquo;s not too much to ask that people who come here share our values.&#8221;<br>

		<p> Good for Wilders and the PVV. The powers-that-be in the Netherlands will now be forced to take notice of his movement   &mdash;   though it will give them a bad case of heartburn. Is there a premiership in his future? Stranger things have happened.</p>
<p> Two more comments: Was Reuters editorializing when they showed a portrait photo of Wilders with what appears to be red tape over his mouth? And isn&rsquo;t it interesting how, while the Left always accuses the Right of espousing &#8220;hatred,&#8221; it&rsquo;s nearly always conservative or White Nationalist politicians who have to be protected by bodyguards, and whose appearances are disrupted by opponents all too often?</p>

<p>Interestingly, I think any such electoral results in Europe should be very bracing to white racial realists in countries such as: USA, Canada, New Zealand, or Australia. Particularly for the USA, this is true; we have lived for so long (almost 80 years) under our two party dictatorship of &ldquo;left wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; Marxism, that we forget that an honest alternative can be and should be the dominant political force in this country. Or put another way, the two major parties here are little better than funhouse mirror reflections of each other, and they use the US Constitution as their snot rag and wipe.</p>
<p>We need a third party in this country (and I am not speaking of a diversity Tea Party) that openly advocates: for a strict interpretation of the original Constitution and Bill of Rights, demands a white majority of 80% or greater, and fiercely rejects any form of multiculturalism as anti-white terrorism and genocidal Marxism. There should be no cowardly compromising on these three points, ever; in fact, that should be such a party&rsquo;s only platform when not considering more transitory or esoteric foreign and domestic policy issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, any attempt by the Republicans to &ldquo;absorb&rdquo; such a third party, should be rejected out of hand. Let those in that deranged elephants&rsquo; graveyard that wish to be part of a more animated school of Great Whites, join such a party honestly and without corrupt intent. </p>
<p>If they cannot do that, leave them to rot in their self-made Neo Con necropolis!</p>

		<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m glad for this development. On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t really trust Wilders. He strikes me as someone who sees his fight as something rooted in ideology, rather than blood and heritage. I&rsquo;m getting vibes that he&rsquo;s fine with immigration, so long as it&rsquo;s not Islamic. Am I off the mark?</p>

		<p>Bus driver Theo Verstappen doesn&rsquo;t quite get it yet.  No Moslems, nor any non-Whites belong in Holland.  You don&rsquo;t want them to take part in your community, because the &#8220;good&#8221; ones will have the same effect as the &#8220;bad&#8221; ones in the long run.  </p>

<p>The encouraging poll numbers notwithstanding, the comment above illustrates how decades of mass media brainwashing in the West has neutered the native populations.  A more appropriate comment would be:  I have nothing personal against Arabs but I have no desire to see the Dutch people go the way of the Sioux.</p>

		<p>No doubt there are many good Muslims, and I know some of them. That is not the point however when it comes to flooding Europe with them. We do not need to encourage the spread of more defective religious dogmas, and Muslim immigration does this. Not only that, Islam has left a trail of blood behind it from the very beginning  &mdash;  in spite of the fact that there have always been good Muslims. Better to allow Europe to develop on its own without this kind of regressive influence and an anachronistic albatross around its neck, and let Muslim countries develop on their own. Surely the latter can find economic use for all those who would emigrate, if not now, then under better economic ideologies in the future. The religious issues aside, emigration also represents a drain of brain and brawn  &mdash;  the position of the old Left if I have it right. </p>

		<p>&#8220;We need a third party in this country&#8221;</p>
<p>No we don&rsquo;t.  What we need is a new government.  One that is NOT a democracy or at least, a limited democracy of the type we used to have in this country (one where only white landowning men were allowed a vote).</p>
<p>The exact form does not matter.  What matters is that every aspect of it is controlled by white christian men.  Not a single ounce of power, in any sphere, from politics to business, law enforcement nor education&hellip;.nor anything else, can be allowed to be held by a non-white, especially jews or muslims.</p>
<p>What we need is white supremacism.  The entire history of the civilized world was built on white supremacism&hellip;..which isn&rsquo;t even close to being what most people have been brainwashed to think it is.  Almost all the problems of the world can be traced DIRECTLY to whites allowing non-whites to have a say in our countries.  That is the thing whites need to figure out&hellip;..peace, prosperity, justice, are the sole products of white men of faith in control.  Whenever that control slips, these things go away, exactly to the extent that whites are not the ones in control&hellip;.not just for us but for EVERYONE.</p>
<p>Note what I am not saying.  I am not saying that blacks and other non-whites should not have a place in our lands.  Nor that they should not have access to wealth and prosperity.  What I am saying is they should never be allowed to be in charge in any capacity whatsoever.  It&rsquo;s nothing but a disaster that brings great evil to us&hellip;.but also to them.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always surprised that the sociology of religion is never raised in the debate about the future of Islam in Europe. There have been many theories about religion from people like Freud, James, Durkheim, and others. Why are these theories never discussed in the debate? Personally, I just don&rsquo;t believe that Christianity and Islam are basically the same except for some minor surface differences. I think they are very different in the current European context. They can only be categorized together in the legal sense of freedom of religion. In the social sense of motivating followers, striving for power, momentum of fervor, etc, these religions are very different. Geert Wilders has been saying as much when he says Islam is not really a religion but is a totalitarian ideology.</p>

<p>In EU muslim immigration usually means worthless blacks from east Africa or the hostile Pakistanis. No matter which sort of muslims are coming, the only good muslims (to include converts) are muslims living in historically muslim countries and NOT Europe, England, Australia or America.</p>

		<p>John PM #2 - I love your description of our two party system as &#8220;&#8216;left wing&rsquo; and &#8216;right wing&rsquo; Marxism.&#8221; I myself have been describing it for years now as &#8220;Marxism&#8221; (Democrats) and &#8220;Marxism lite&#8221; (Republicans). </p>
<p>As far as the situation in the Netherlands is concerned, I have felt for quite some time that once one White country comes to its senses and rebels, the dam will break. Perhaps the Dutch will start it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually starting to feel a bit optimistic if for no other reason than that the current situation can&rsquo;t go on much longer.    </p>

		<p>I cannot TELL you how happy I was to read this story!!!  My view is, if it can happen in the Netherlands it can also happen HERE!  I am literally PRAYING that the rest of Europe takes notice and follows suit (well, it&rsquo;ll take more courage than France can probably muster, but the REST of Europe can manage it).  Then we, Canada and Australia can perk up and join the good guys and send these wretched Muslims back to their sand dunes where they belong.</p>

		<p>As I understand it, Wilders wants to restrict immigration in general but Muslim immigration in particular.</p>
<p>Paul Belien at the Brussels Journal has an interesting article about Wilders:</p>

		<p>In reply to no.3 whilst I agree that I would rather he ran on an explicit anti immigration/race realist campaign rather than emphasising anti Islamist policies (I would welcome a million anglo-saxon muslims coming to England to boost our numbers rather a million African Christians) Geert is defintiely one of us.<br>
This is definitely a positive for WN and in reality the PVV could do with these gains to attract more competent WNs as they are a bit of a one man show at the moment. Even if Geert has a bit one eyed focus on Muslims he will attract others who are more focused on race whilst bearing in mind most immigrants in Holland are Turkish and Morrocan.</p>

		<p>UK has elections about the same time. For several years now there have been many comparisons between PVV and the BNP. Now Mr Brown, will you finally admit that your decade of unrestricted muslim (mainly pakistani) immigration simply to boost your electoral chances has backfired. Still the BBC promote islam at every opportunity and ignore White English Christians. They have yet to mention the PVV on today&rsquo;s news. The 5 year old &#8216;British&rsquo; (pakistani) boy kidnapped from his family home village in pakistan is on the news evey 20 minutes but the White English couple abducted by muslim pirates offshore somalia is very rarely mentioned. It&rsquo;s a sure bet there is a family involvement in pakistan as the unemployed father, obviously claiming housing and cash benefits in UK could easily afford the airfares for himself and his son and just wants someone to fund the £100,000 fake ransom demand. Best of luck to both PVV and BNP, we in Europe really deserve a restoration to common sense and normality, free from these evil alien influences.</p>

		<p>I have mixed views about the success of Wilders.  On one hand, I believe that radical Islam is a true threat to the safety (and economic well-being) of Europe.  On the other hand, we must not forget the racial angle to all of this.  This is what the neocons do.  They mistake the symptom for the problem.</p>
<p>Wilders is certainly preferable to the socialists that have ruined his country, but neither he nor his PVV are much more than a stopgap solution.<br>

Geert Wilders has been saying as much when he says Islam is not really a religion but is a totalitarian ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; That&rsquo;s exactly what leaders of the Reformation were saying about the Roman Catholic Church in the late middle ages and the Thirty Years War in the 17th century was all about this as well.  The sad fact is that ALL religion has some aspect of the earthly lust for power, some are just more obvious about it than others.  In this, at least Islam is being honest.</p>
<p>Europe wore itself out with religious wars over Christianity, until the final ones in the 20th century.  (WW1 began because when the Serbs rose up against the Muslim Ottoman Turks, they expected the Christian Hapsburgs to support them.  But becasue they were Orthodox Christians, the Austrians felt more comfortable with the &#8220;old order&#8221; and allied with the Turks to suppress the Serbs in 1878.  They did it militarily. This led to organizations for insurrection and seperation in Serbia and Bosnia/Herzegovina.  One of them, The Black Hand, had a member who succeeded in assassinating the Archduke of Austria in 1914 and began WW1, which led to WW2).  The World Wars finally left Europe exhausted.  The rise of philosophies like Existentialism was what the cataclysm of WW1 left Christian Europe.  So present day Europe can only be nominally termed Christian.  No one is willing to go to war for Christianity, and very few for any ideal or principle.  </p>
<p>Europeans are mostly concerned with living in the present. For the most part, Cathedrals are museums for tourists.  Americans, on the other hand, think of almost everything in a futuristic sense.  The most compelling political argument any politician seems to have is concerned with what we will be leaving our grandchildren, a statement that is now so old that the first generation of politician&rsquo;s who used it have grandchildren who are using it while their own present standard of living is on the average lower than their grandparents.</p>
<p>Islam and Christianity owe their existence to Judaism, where they received (or borrowed) their foundations and influence.  In that way, they are certainly in the same category.  Historically, Christianity did the same thing in Europe (and elsewhere) that Islam has sought to do since the 14th century; enter and convert Europe to their version of Middle Eastern monotheism.  The drive to force conversion in the New World was certainly as much a part of Europe&rsquo;s expansion as the 7th century Arab Expansion, where Islam fired the cause.  I have long considered Islam a sort of historical reply to Christianity by jealous Arabs who felt left behind and humiliated.  So they came up with a religion that served their desire to expand their merchant driven civilization where slavery was the main trade.  Mohammad was a merchant who had his own &#8220;revelation&#8221; you will recall.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find the subject fascinating as so many take part in the various religious beliefs, based as they are on fear and superstition (and myth), yet nearly always fail to see how they are being used by organizations that really don&rsquo;t care one pin about their race or ethnicity.  <br>

<p>Yes, it is true, that for the most part, the various races and religions in the USA do sort of get along in the sense that we are not yet in  outright warfare.  However, this is only temporary.</p>
<p>As long as we have a high standard of living and ample welfare programs, diversity can maintain.  However, oil will soon run out, leading to dramatic decrease in food production and an inability to get food, water, energy and supplies into our very dense (Minority-populated) cities.  Likewise, we will have difficulties removing garbage and sewage from cities.  We will be unable to commute to work or heat or cool our houses.</p>
<p>We all &#8220;get along&#8221; now, but it will all break down into chaos and ethnic warfare when any of the following combinations eventually happen (and they will, in our lifetimes): End of oil, drought, flooding, earthquake, sea-level rise, epidemic, agricultural disaster, fishery extinction, powerplant meltdown, volcano, etc.  Don&rsquo;t believe me?  What happened after Katrina?   &mdash;   and that was only after a few days without access to AC, TV and potato chips.  Imagine LA or NY without food, water, electricity or gasoline for 2 weeks!  This will be the turning point.  This will be when you will band together with your kin for your survival.  Diversity will not be a benefit to your community.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m getting vibes that he&rsquo;s fine with immigration, so long as it&rsquo;s not Islamic. Am I off the mark?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the majority of immigrants are muslim there it&rsquo;s no surprise that he would focus on it. But it actually doesn&rsquo;t matter. What does is that increasingly bold people are putting themsleves out there and winning over the population. There are tens of millions of people who have had to take to white flight. The hair-splitters notwithstanding, most folks flat out don&rsquo;t want any kind of third-world presence in their country.</p>
<p>So lets say a Wilders or a Tancredo suddenly goes soft. If there is any indication in what happened to Lou Dobbs&rsquo; popularity what you&rsquo;ll see, and what I actually heard from people, is the average Joe saying &#8220;F*** that guy! We&rsquo;ll back somebody else!&#8221;, and like the snowball that it is someone else will make an even bolder public statement in favor of out-and-out White Nationalism and win with it. Do you think that five years ago a head of state would have said something like &#8220;Italy is NOT a multi-ethnic nation.&#8221;? </p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s the multicult frog that is being boiled. Bath&rsquo;s kinda hot, eh antis?</p>

		<p>To Varina, regarding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually starting to feel a bit optimistic if for no other reason than that the current situation can&rsquo;t go on much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very good point Varina, things are so bad that it is hard to imagine them getting worse, or for the insanely dueling Stalinist (Democrats) and Trotskyite (Republicans) system to endure much longer. Right now, the Republicans will enjoy the electoral fruits of a &ldquo;backlash&rdquo; victory in November that will see them capture the US House again, at a minimum. But they will, as is typical of them, fail to capitalize on its rejection of multicultural Obamaism and its domestic failures. Instead, they will focus on &ldquo;internationalist&rdquo; nonsense that sees the whole world as a Pax Neo Con utopia of &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; and &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; best won at the end of a sword.</p>
<p>In the end, both parties will likely implode within the context of their own secular religion, multiculturalism; the schisms in that secular religion have always been there, it is just a question of when they finally go atomically Weimar.  </p>
<p>All the best to you Varina,</p>

Our alien overlords have overplayed their hand and it&rsquo;s resulting in catastrophic consequences.  There&rsquo;s a split occurring in the Democrat Party between certain factions and the neocon infrastructure of the Republicans is crumbling away.

<p>We need to retain the moral high-ground. Therefore, we need to take the human (and legal) rights of non-whites within (and without) our societies very seriously indeed. We need to state the needs and rights of white people forcefully (including our right to our homelands), and without unreasonable compromise, while continuing to acknowledge and honour the undeniable rights and human dignity of non-whites in the wider world. If we fail to do so, we dishonour ourselves as well.</p>

__  __  __  __  __</p>
<p>Forgive me, Johnny, but I must disagree  here with your usual good sense.  I think #7 has thought it through VERY CAREFULLY, and he sees that sometimes it is necessary to  take the bull by the horns;  he sees that timid half measures will get us exactly nowhere&hellip; in fact, will get us exactly where we are now, being over-scrupulous about the &#8220;rights&#8221; of everyone else but ourselves.  He is not a troll, a lunatic, or hothead!  He sees the urgency (and seriousness)  of our situation more clearly than you do.</p>
<p>I do at least agree with you that moral behavior and reasonable  (not treasonable!) respect for the rights of others   &mdash;   of non-whites and so-called &#8220;minorities&#8221;   &mdash;   must be upheld (but not placed on a pedestal, as we have been doing);  but that OUR OWN rights   &mdash;   that of the majority, while we still are   &mdash;   must take precedence when there is any conflict between the two.  There is nothing &#8220;immoral&#8221; in putting  the survival and well being of one&rsquo;s own people first.  Blacks and others would certainly not be so solicitous of our well being, nor ever put our interests and rights above theirs.  Mincing delicately around these issues and being overly scrupulous about &#8220;offending&#8221; anybody will get us exactly nowhere;  and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been doing for the past half century of appeasing and compromising and temporizing.  </p>
<p>We  have been able to do that, thus far, when we [whites]  enjoyed the luxury of being a powerful and secure majority who could afford to  be beneficent.  But we are approaching the situation where we will no longer be able to indulge in that luxury, and thus we will have to look realistically at how we must behave in this approaching new status.  Some whites, such as those in South Africa and (former) Rhodesia have already had to face that new reality, and we see what their unhappy situation is.  Have we learned nothing?  Are we going to wait that long&hellip; until it is too late?  </p>
<p>It seems to me that #7 is saying what is difficult to face; but sometimes it is necessary to swallow the bitter pill.  Trying to avoid  any unpleasantness and take the sweeter pill instead is dodging reality and will only prolong the disastrous policies we&rsquo;ve been following for too many decades now.  We see the results of that   &mdash;  -  the loss of our countries and our culture.   No separation (of races)  or expulsion (of invading aliens) will be pleasant, comfortable, or easy&hellip; it&rsquo;s just not going to happen that way.  Thinking or hoping otherwise is a fantasy.  If you can&rsquo;t face it, or quibble about extending justice to your enemies who would conquer you, you will have to live with the results.  They will not be so solicitous about your rights!  Those of us who can&rsquo;t face it now are condemning their grandchildren to have to face it later. No white person in America (or Britain) who was living in Detroit or Los Angeles or Philadelphia  (or Manchester or Leeds or London), would have imagined, half a century ago, what their hometowns would look like today.   Not being able to concieve of such a scenario, they did not take vigorous action to forstall it and protect their futures; but instead they voted Labour and Democrat.  They marched for Martin Luther King;  they supported (or at least allowed)  &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movements, school bussing,  and immigration reform; gave money to SPLC;  voted  for the Kennedy programmes, for Johnson&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221;, etc.  And all along they continued to vote for the same politicians and parties and policies.   Is the outcome surprising? </p>
<p>So now in the same manner,  quailing at  vigorous and decisive action today, the white countries of the present will become the Zimbabwe&rsquo;s and Detroit&rsquo;s  of tomorrow.   In sum, to bring about  this eventuality, all we need  to do is nothing!</p>

<p>I hear you, but these white landowning men were the ones who advocated African slavery and massive 3rd world immigration. They created this mess from the very beginning, and they still have the same policies (McCain, Bush, etc)</p>

<p>This may be a step in the right direction, but it&rsquo;s a very small step.  It would be like if America only had the Democratic Party and then got the Republican party too.  It&rsquo;s still very far away from what is needed for the long term survival of Netherlands.</p>
<p>Hopefully, a real nationalist movement will emerge in the Netherlands.  Ideologically, Wilders is like a hard line American neoconservative.  We wouldn&rsquo;t support John Bolton or Daniel Pipes for president and we should support Wilders.  White Nationalists must be the only people so desperate that they will celebrate the success of someone who denounces them and calls them nazis.  </p>

<p>Thank you, ATBOTL.  Well said!  I think you have it figured right.  I&rsquo;ve long suspected that Wilders is a shill for other powerful but hidden interests that lurk in the background.  I fear he won&rsquo;t represent much real change (any more than Sarkozy did, coming to office with the same &#8220;tough guy&#8221; ploy).   Well, maybe headscarfs will be banned in Holland.  So what!  That&rsquo;s laughable.</p>
<p>Still, something is better then nothing &hellip; so they say.  In that case, I suppose Wilders is  &#8220;something&#8221;.  But he&rsquo;s not Charles Martel, which is what Europe needs.   If a real Charles Martel miraculously appeared, the Powers That Be would never tolerate him for an instant. He&rsquo;d be assassinated or imprisoned or declared insane before getting to step one.<br>

<i>&#8220;Note what I am not saying. I am not saying that blacks and other non-whites should not have a place in our lands. Nor that they should not have access to wealth and prosperity. What I am saying is they should never be allowed to be in charge in any capacity whatsoever. It&rsquo;s nothing but a disaster that brings great evil to us&hellip;.but also to them.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I largely agree with your synopsis, but have reservations about the latter points raised in it.  </p>
<p>I overwhelmingly believe it is as a result of allowing non-Whites a place in our lands that has gotten us into our present life-threatening dilemma, in the first place starting with the transatlantic slave trade commenced by our Jewish brethren who also almost exclusively owned the ships and other commercial enterprises involved in and surrounding it.</p>
<p>Wealth and prosperity creates power and depending on the extent and spread of that wealth and prosperity regardless of race or creed, can create a power bloc, at least for a period of time, unfortunately.</p>
<p>As a person of part-Jewish extraction and an avid White Nationalist, and member of the British National Party, I would rather indigenous White nations reclaimed their rightful homelands with a view to repatriating non-White planters, but in the meantime, to remove their citizenship and voting privileges which they were never entitled to in the first place bearing in mind, the latterday nature of the Third World non-White invasion, ie, a deliberately engineered and executed genocide of White nations conceived in its original form and (later incorporating non-White invasion as an additional weapon) as far back as the middle of the 19th century -some say, the French Revolution by, once again, our Jewish brethren and their traitorous White co-conspirators.</p>
<p>No, my criteria would be based on the following:</p>
<p>If non-Whites are to be considered for continued residence on White territories, non-White nations must first satisfy several conditions such as, for example,</p>
<p>Allowing mass White invasion (sorry, <i>immigration</i>) of their ancestral territories,</p>
<p>Affirmative Action and the implementation of an across-the-board quota system for White incomers only.</p>
<p>White exemption from accusations of &#8216;racism&rsquo; also extended to the criminal offences category.</p>
<p>The promotion and open advocacy of White culture, Western Christianity and associated traditions.</p>
<p>Election of White incomers to high profile positions within all political, judicial and societal arenas WITHOUT exception based on racial grounds primarily.</p>
<p>Now, when non-White nations have satisfied my criteria, then and only then can it be decided that non-whites, in turn, be considered deserving of a place in White homelands albeit under any conditions White nations deem necessary to enact for the survival of their own ethnicities.</p>
<p>I hope I have made my most salient points crystal clear to the <i>current</i> powers-that-be around the world.<br>

<p>John, third parties are, given public inattention and shallowness, impractical politics. A much more promising route would be for the tea party majority to &#8220;absorb&#8221; the Republican Party instead, purge all the state and federal hacks and RINOs from it over the next two elections, and run thereafter on strong basic American conservative principles and policies. </p>
<p>(Basically, a Pat Buchanan platform): End all immigration until we culturally absorb as Americans who&rsquo;s here; Financially punish employers of illegals until all illegal jobs disappear and the illegals walk back to Mexico - cost free to the taxpayer; End the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; nonsense. Cut taxes, cut superfluous federal departments like Commerce, Energy, Education, Agriculture, etc.; Freeze government spending at the current level and leave it up to the various federal departments to subsequently choose required annual budget cuts - and keep it that way for years until the federal debt vanishes; Replace the nine thousand page federal tax code with a one page flat tax/or a tax returnless national sales tax on all purchases and eliminate 90% of the IRS. (These changes are just for openers, this space is too limited for other equally effective measures to finally bring OUR government to heel, shrink its size, and remove all federally created debt from long betrayed working American citizens.)       </p>

<p>Ideally, that may be fine, in purest theory. But in reality, the one follows from the other.  You CANNOT have them present without having them demanding their &#8220;rights&#8221; and eventually pressing for a greater and greater share of the pie. We see before us on a daily basis, year after year, the on-going parade of their endless complaints and demands.  We see that no matter how much they are given and how many concessions are made, these are never enough, and one concession only leads to demands for another. </p>
<p>The only guarantee against this is not having &#8220;others&#8221; among you. Do you own work; have your own society; peel your own vegetables; make your own beds; mow your own lawn; collect your own garbage. Employ only your own. Pay decent wages.  Be entirely self-reliant and have no one (else) that you must depend on to keep the wheels running. Shake the dependency on alien labor, alien advisors, alien skills, alien capital. Run your own country and depend only on yourselves. </p>
<p>Let them have their OWN rights and opportunities, all they want, in THEIR OWN countries.</p>
