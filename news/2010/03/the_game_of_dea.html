<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Game of Death [a French documentary] is an adaptation of an infamous experiment conducted by a team led by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. In order to test people&rsquo;s obedience to authority figures, the scientists demanded that subjects administer increasingly strong electric shocks to other participants if they answered questions incorrectly. The people delivering the shocks, however, didn&rsquo;t know that the charges were fake  &mdash;  the volunteers on the other end of the room were actors pretending to suffer agonizing pain. The point was to see how many people would continue following orders to mete out torture. {snip}</p>
<p>Milgram found that 62.5% of his subjects could be encouraged, browbeaten or intimidated into seeing the test through to its conclusion by delivering scores of shocks of increasing intensity to the maximum of 450 volts. In The Game of Death, 81% of contestants go all the way by administering more than 20 shocks of up to a maximum of 460 volts. Only 16 of the 80 subjects recruited for the fake game show refuse the verbal prodding from the host  &mdash;  and pressure from the audience to keep dishing out the torture like a good sport  &mdash;  though most express misgivings or try to pull out before being persuaded otherwise.</p>
<p>Nick says he got the idea for the project after stumbling across an episode of the French version of The Weakest Link. The willingness of the adult contestants to allow the hostess to belittle them  &mdash;  and their own eagerness to backstab fellow participants for their own gain  &mdash;  convinced him that Milgram&rsquo;s findings about the human submission to authority figures were particularly applicable to TV. &#8220;Television is a power  &mdash;  we know that, but it remained theoretical,&#8221; Nick told the daily Le Parisien on Wednesday. &#8220;I asked myself, Is it so strong that it can turn us into potential torturers?&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The results of Nick&rsquo;s documentary indicate the answer to that question is yes  &mdash;  a conclusion reinforced by the program&rsquo;s editors and his sobering voice-overs. Indeed, while most critics have applauded Nick&rsquo;s effort to reveal the manipulative powers of television, some commentators suggest he nonetheless errs by leaving no room to contest the documentary&rsquo;s conclusions. {snip}</p>
<p>Despite that, Marzolf and others say the documentary demonstrates how a television-studio setting  &mdash;  with cameras, a pushy host and an audience that erupts at times with shouts of &#8220;Punishment!&#8221;  &mdash;  may be ideal for robbing individuals of their will. {snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps, but some could argue that Nick&rsquo;s documentary relies on the same reality-TV techniques it is denouncing. Though staged, the game show features unsuspecting volunteers whose reactions and emotions are scrutinized. Although the voice-overs and cuts to sociologists involved in the project make it obvious that the show is a behavioral study, viewers are still required to buy into the &#8220;reality&#8221; that participants have been lured there in order to be horrified when they continue applying the electric shocks.</p>

		<p>I think in the original test, the shock-dial went up to a point that said &#8216;danger&rsquo; or something where the subject could even be killed. I believe very little in the mainstream media, however, including this. </p>

		<p>Interesting story, but really, what does it have to do with issues of race?  Given the fact humans are by nature highly socialized animals, the conclusion of this study was hardly surprising.</p>
<p>Back in 1975 actor William Shatner made a tv movie based on Stanley Milgram&rsquo;s experiment.  It was called &#8220;The Tenth Level&#8221;.  It was actually pretty decent viewing.</p>

		<p>Bogus! I am sure most, if not all, contestants realize that a TV show is fake and that the &#8220;shocks&#8221; were pretend.  This is meaningless.<br>

		<p>I read about the Yale experiment 40 years ago.  The liberals claimed that it showed that the average American would be a willing SS man, if only someone in authority told him to.  Honest psychologists criticized the experiment because the subjects were not randomly chosen.  The pool of candidates was stacked with losers.  The descriptions of their dialogues with the experimenters showed it.  After all, just who is volunteering to take part in an experiment during working hours on a working day, when the economy was doing great and unemployment was very low?  <br>
     Certainly, lots of people are servile, especially anti-racists, but we&rsquo;d all still be bowing to princes and bishops if there were not an appreciable number of independent souls among the White race.  </p>

		<p>Another way to look at this is if the experiment itself was manipulative.  The idea being to give &#8220;scientific&#8221; proof that people were pre-disposed to obey &#8220;authority&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have my own idea for an experiment.  We redo this experiment but instead tell the person who is to do the shocking that their victim is an UNWILLING participent.</p>
<p>Then see the compliance rate&hellip;.which would be zero.  At least for whites.</p>
<p>The whole thing rests on the presumption that the target wants to participate in this and that what&rsquo;s going on is harmless. Remove either of those two factors and compliance drops to zero.</p>
<p>The point of the whole thing is to convince others that people are sheep that will do what they are told by authority no matter what.  The hope is, of course, to try and cause compliance in an individual by tricking him into thinking everyone else would comply also.  The experiment itself is the brainwashing.</p>

		<p>What is it that these &#8220;experiments/entertainments&#8221; demonstrate? IMHO it shows that in a scientific or entertainment situation,  people believe that no one is deliberately injured. In fact, great efforts are made to prevent it because of legal liability. This belief was confirmed by the &#8220;Game of Death&#8221;: No damage was inflicted on anyone.</p>
<p>These are good examples of trash television and junk science.</p>

		<p>The sinister underlying message of these bogus staged &#8220;studies&#8221; is reinforcing acceptance of the REAL threat&hellip;.acceptance that all we average citizens are at heart unthinking, cruel, easily swayed sheep, and therefore need an elite to guide us and control us and save us from ourselves.  How about hundreds of years of empirical evidence that more citizens have been killed by their own GOVERNMENTS than have been killed by other citizens and criminals?  Just taking the soviet and maoists governments alone how many do you come up with?  hundreds of millions?</p>

		<p>I have many professor friends, and I&rsquo;ve known them for decades. That said, I have an insider&rsquo;s view on the deceit and flaws in &#8220;research.&#8221; It is often flawed from it&rsquo;s inception. People in Academia are just fishing for grants, notoriety, tenure, money, power, authority, undue honors and respect&hellip;just like politicians. They are not all bad. The problem is they&rsquo;re all to average in their wisdom and morals.</p>
<p>This is a twofold point: </p>
<p>One should by no means trust experimental results, because the people who ran the experiments, though intelligent, though manipulative, though clever, are sometimes unwise. And the participants are often average also..in other words, they are of an amoral character. </p>

		<p>people are sheep and Milgran&rsquo;s study is still credible. </p>
<p>he wanted to prove that the gernmas were somehow more obedient, and was shocked at the results:<br>
all human communities submit mindlessly to authority in large numbers.</p>
<p>mob rule and conformism are always stronger forces than the integrity of the individual, and an alert, well-informed citizen is a rarity. <br>
 <br>
how to foster independent, critical thinking and consience before conformity? </p>
<p>this is still the most important question for any democracy.<br>

		<p>10 Anon: Yes, there are plenty of natural born slaves, even among Whites, and it is folly to pretend otherwise.  That&rsquo;s why I oppose universal suffrage.  Moderns consider it shocking, but Aristotle said the same thing over 2000 years ago.   But, judging from political history, Whites have a higher proportion of independent thinkers among them.  I hope there are enough left today.  <br>
     BTW, I regard ignorance of the doings of celebrities as a useful, though not infallible, indicator of mental competence.  </p>

		<p>The Yale experiment was real; I remember it from a college psych class.  As was said above, though, the deck was stacked, exactly as Schoolteacher and Anonymous 8:12 PM wrote.  </p>
<p>As for &#8220;&hellip;we&rsquo;d all still be bowing to princes and bishops&hellip;&#8221;, I think the Catholic church&rsquo;s child sexual abuse scandal, which ran on for years and saw the church repeatedly &#8220;recycle&#8221; known offenders by simply transferring them to new areas shows that people are all too ready to grovel.  How many Catholics withdrew themselves and their children because of this disgusting behavior?  Then there was Michael Jackson&rsquo;s antics; after the first big payoffs of &#8220;hush&#8221; money, parents continued to allow Jackson unsupervised access to their children.  These parents, who knew Jackon&rsquo;s proclivities - the whole nation did - were basically pimping their kids to a rock star.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;people are sheep and Milgran&rsquo;s study is still credible.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s entirely accurate.</p>
<p>The people in these experiments are told the people who are being shocked AGREED to the terms of the experiment.</p>
<p>Would the results be as overwhelming if the people were told the alleged victims didn&rsquo;t submit voluntarily?</p>
<p>The way the experiment is structured, it leaves room to question how many people are soulless sadists mindlessly following orders and who are the ones participating in the experiment as it was explained to them (IE, shocking people who agreed to be shocked).</p>
<p>You may have to try the experiment in different formats. For example, tell people that the shock victims weren&rsquo;t willing volunteers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what plausible reason you could give the shockers as to why people who didn&rsquo;t consent were being shocked but the results might vary.</p>
<p>If I had gone through this experiment and I heard people screaming, one of the first questions I would ask my handler was &#8216;are you sure these people agreed to this? Did they know how much it was going to hurt?&rsquo; If they told me, &#8216;yes&rsquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t have too much difficulty continuing knowing the &#8216;victims&rsquo; consented.<br>

<p>But where do they get their ideas and values?  Do they think hard and come up with them on their own?  No!  There&rsquo;s not a flicker of originality to be found among them.</p>
<p>I have always been amazed to observe how slavishly conformist these self-styled &#8220;rebels&#8221; are.  It became fashionable to be a non-formist and to flaunt it. Soon, every copycat teenager and ghetto hoodlum was conforming to the rebel image.   Remember when (for one example) they started wearing their baseball caps backward?  It was a demonstration that they were rebels against conformity. They were &#8220;doing their own thing&#8221;.  Soon, everybody was doing it!  They were ALL being rebels and non-conformists.  </p>
<p>But no they weren&rsquo;t, not really. They were being conformists. Slavish conformists!  Next thing, they started wearing their outsized pants  down around their knees, dragging on the ground, with their underwear showing&hellip; they were &#8220;doing their own thing&#8221; again. No slaves to fashion, they!   They were rugged individualists.  Yeah, sure. But soon, everybody was doing it.  All being slaves to fashion!  (Well, every fool who was gullible enough to imitate what he saw the rap stars doing on television.)</p>
<p>Remember when John Lenon, rebelling against fashion, good looks and good grooming,  made popular the utterly plain look, stringy hair, filthy torn clothes, and round metal-rimmed glasses (the uglier the better)?  Soon, all his slavish followers, demonstrating their rejection of conformity (!!!), were wearing torn jeans, stringy hair, and ugly round glasses.  (Many still are.)</p>
<p>Sorry to tell these rebels against conformity, but when everybody is being a non-conformist, they are all conformists!</p>

<p>Agreed. But how would you guarantee that they are among the voters&hellip; instead of EXCLUDED from the voters?   &mdash;  - which would seem just as likely, if not more so.  It could work either way. Indeed, the powers-that-be would prefer conformists and followers who will not rock the boat (<i>their</i> boat). Independent thinkers have always been a prickly bunch who make the authorities nervous. (They got rid of Socrates, didn&rsquo;t they?)</p>
<p><i>&#8220;BTW, I regard ignorance of the doings of celebrities as a useful, though not infallible, indicator of mental competence.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Agreed again. Anyone who takes their cues (particularly political or social) from  air-brained celebrities is mentally suspect.  Why should I care what Barbra Streisand, Madonna, or Sean Penn think about any particular matter?   I&rsquo;d rather go in the opposite direction!</p>

		<p>20 browser: How to guarantee that the natural slaves are excluded from citizenship, and not thinking people?  Fortunately, the Left have done much of our sorting for us.  By making treason the socially acceptable norm, the stupid, the slavish, and the selfishly expedient have all been invited to reveal themselves.  It&rsquo;s very much like having a foreign occupation during wartime, and noticing who helped the occupiers.  When Whites regain control of our countries, will the diversity coordinators and their mirmidons keep their big houses?  Nope, and they won&rsquo;t be holding offices either.  </p>
