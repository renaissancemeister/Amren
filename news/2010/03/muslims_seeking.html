<h1><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2690763">Muslims Seeking Female Clerk Can &#8216;Line Up Again&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Graeme Hamilton, National Post (Toronto), March 17, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In recent years, the few fully veiled Muslim women who had dealings with Quebec&rsquo;s health-insurance board could choose to be served by a woman to avoid exposing their faces to a man outside their family.</p>
<p>But in the latest example of the province&rsquo;s growing resistance to the accommodation of minority religious practices, the insurance board on Tuesday announced the end of the policy after the provincial human rights commission said it has no duty to acquiesce.</p>
<p>&#8220;From now on, for a woman who is veiled with a niqab or a burka and comes to our office asking to be photographed by a woman, the answer is no,&#8221; said Marc Lortie, spokesman for the Régie de l&rsquo;assurance maladie du Québec. &#8220;Line up again, or come back another day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news follows last week&rsquo;s expulsion from a French-as-a-second-language course of an Egyptian woman who insisted on wearing a niqab during class. It was the second school Naema Ahmed was expelled from for wearing the full face covering, which leaves only a slit for the eyes. Authorities at the first school had said her teacher was unable to properly assess her pronunciation without seeing her mouth.</p>
<p>Quebec&rsquo;s Immigration Department said she could not continue her studies while wearing the niqab.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to integrate into Quebec society, here are our values,&#8221; Immigration Minister Yolande James told reporters last week. &#8220;We want to see your face.&#8221; Ms. Ahmed has filed a complaint with the Quebec Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>After the health-insurance board sought its expertise on the niqab issue, the rights commission published its opinion on Monday that requiring a veiled woman to briefly expose her face to a male employee is not a significant breach of her rights.</p>
<p>In 2008-09, 10 people out of the 118,000 using the health-insurance board&rsquo;s Montreal service centre had, for religious reasons, requested to be served by a woman. No such requests were made in its other centre in Quebec City. The centres process applications for new health cards, which require a photograph.</p>
<p>The commission reasoned that a woman would only have to remove her veil briefly for purposes of identification. It drew a distinction with people who for religious reasons ask that a driving test be given by a member of the same sex. In an earlier opinion, the commission said the province should accommodate such requests because the person is in a confined space with a member of the opposite sex for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>The new Quebec policy is at odds with practices for health-card applications in Ontario, where women are served by female employees if their religious beliefs require. The Ontario government has also established procedures to allow identity photos to be taken in private, if requested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, staff at Ontario service centres are very aware of cultural requirements and diversity and we do our best to accommodate individual situations,&#8221; said Alan Cairns, a spokesman for the Ministry of Government Services.</p>
<p>The furor over the still rarely seen niqab is a clear sign that Quebec&rsquo;s debate over the &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; of religious and ethnic minorities has returned with full force.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Quebec media were filled with reports of perceived threats to mainstream Quebec values  &mdash;  for example, a sugar shack that prepared a pork-free menu for Muslims and a gym that frosted its windows so young Hasidic men in a school next door would not be distracted by exercising women. In 2007, Premier Jean Charest appointed two respected thinkers  &mdash;  Charles Taylor and Gérard Bouchard  &mdash;  to study the question.</p>
<p>The Bouchard-Taylor commission&rsquo;s hearings and 2008 final report calmed things down for a time, but Mr. Charest&rsquo;s government failed to act on most of the commission&rsquo;s key recommendations.</p>
<p>An example of the government&rsquo;s skittishness on the question came last week when Family Minister Tony Tomassi said he had no objection to allowing religious instruction in government-subsidized daycares operated by Islamic and Jewish groups. The next day, faced with loud opposition, he reversed his position and said religious teaching would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>A group calling itself &#8220;Intellectuals for secularism&#8221; published a declaration on Tuesday arguing for a completely secular government. No government employee should be allowed to wear any religious symbol, and the crucifix that hangs in the National Assembly should be removed, the group, which includes former premier Bernard Landry, argued.</p>
<p>Jean-François Lisée, executive director of the Université de Montréal&rsquo;s international studies centre and a signatory of the declaration, said public opinion in Quebec is shifting towards secularism. The &#8220;neutrality of the state&#8221; that government employees represent is compromised when they wear a religious symbol, he said, whether it is a crucifix, a Jewish skullcap or a Muslim headscarf. Quebec, he said, is wrestling with how to respond to &#8220;a stronger assertiveness of orthodox religions, be they Jewish, Muslim or Catholic. The answer seems to be more secular now than would have been the case two or three years ago.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As long as the item is unobtrusive such as a cross or kippah and does not interfere with the identification of the wearer by covering his or her face then there should be no problem. However women covering their faces is a hazard to security and refusing to show their faces to officials whatever their gender puts everyone at risk. If a private business such as the coffee shop or women&rsquo;s gym wants to accomodate by frosting their windows or not serving pork then it is up to them. </p>

		<p>One can only hope that Quebec&rsquo;s attitudes towards standing up for Judeo-Christian culture and white people, and against annoying third-world practices, will spread to the rest of Canada and the United States. As a linguistic (French) minority in North America, the Quebecois are much more aware of the need to fight for their survival than is the case with white people elsewhere. Granted, Quebec made mistakes in admitting third-worlders just because they spoke French, but it&rsquo;s culture, not the classic French/English language friction, that&rsquo;s top of mind for many Quebecois these days.</p>
<p>The following attitude - &ldquo;Generally speaking, staff at Ontario service centres are very aware of cultural requirements and diversity and we do our best to accommodate individual situations&rdquo;  - is what we need to do away with. I feel like brushing up on my French and moving to Quebec!</p>

		<p>Muslims really confuse me.  They don&rsquo;t want their women getting a simple photograph of their faces taken by a male, but yet I have read that in actual Muslim countries men work in lingerie shops more than women do. I think I read that it is because they don&rsquo;t want women running stores over there unless it is a female only mall. The women over there are trying to fight this (the men in lingerie stores).</p>
<p>Do you see how Muslims contradict themselves?  I personally don&rsquo;t think men should be working in lingerie stores even in the United States. If I want advice on a bra, I want to talk to a woman about it&hellip;not a man who is going to sit there imagining me wearing it.  But in Muslim countries apparently that is considered okay, but in the mean time women aren&rsquo;t allowed to  show their faces to a man to get a drivers license or whatever else!</p>

		<p>Driver&rsquo;s licenses????  They need a female for the test?  Excuse me, but in their own native countries THEY AREN&rsquo;T ALLOWED TO DRIVE AND NEITHER SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE IN OUR COUNTRIES.  Especially with only an eye slit to see through.  That&rsquo;s just plain DANGEROUS TO OTHERS.</p>

		<p>Well, the question is always asked, and with good reason: &#8220;how do you actually know that it is a woman behind that mask??&#8221; NOT just a veil, a mask. And for the driver of a car, wearing a mask is not against the law, religion or no religion? Obviously you cannot see properly to drive safely with just &#8220;a slit&#8221; to see through?</p>
<p>Normally, weaing a mask in most locales is of itself against the law unless it is part of a gala event!</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t the Hasidic men just frost over THEIR WINDOWS!!??</p>
<p>Or just brick over the windows so they will not even see anyone?</p>

		<p>There are all kinds of Muslims. Those Muslims that insist on covering their women should not be welcome in our countries. Those that can adapt to our customs should be the only candidates for immigration. </p>

		<p>One reason the officials in Quebec can adopt this somewhat hardline approach is that they don&rsquo;t have the ACLU up there filing endless, frivolous antidiscrimination lawsuits. </p>

		<p>There is a simple solution to this idiocy. If you must hide your face as well as the rest of your body for fear of driving men wild with your charms, then please don&rsquo;t try to change this culture. Just go back to the countries that tell you that you are worthless and demand that you be subsurvient, and maybe someday you&rsquo;ll learn that this behavior is contrary to equality. Muslims live in the 10th century and will never assimilate to a world that left them far behind. The extremist will keep women as slaves and chattals, but if that&rsquo;s what you want, go right ahead, just don&rsquo;t expect civilized countries to put up with this nonsense.</p>

		<p>It is a bit difficult to deal with someone when you can&rsquo;t even see their face? It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine mix-ups in medical treatments when a &#8220;masked&#8221; woman is accidentally given someone else&rsquo;s treatment.</p>

		<p>A health insurance card should probably be considered a necessity in a country with socialized medicine, but a license to drive a car is NOT a necessity.  Blind people, poor people, the Amish, etc., all do without a driver&rsquo;s license.  </p>
<p>I would offer reasonable accommodation on the photo ID for medical care, but if sitting in a car with a man for an hour is just too indecent, then maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t be out on the road.  What happens if you have a flat tire?  Is it possible to change a tire while wearing a pup tent?  If you are pulled over by a cop, does it have to be a female cop?</p>
<p>I am female, and agree with the poster who mentioned the male lingerie salespeople.  Utterly creepy.  These people should NOT be allowed to immigrate and then try to impose all of their delicate sensibilities on a system that was working fine till they arrived.</p>
