	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if a contest were held for &#8220;lying to do good,&#8221; today&rsquo;s radical tenured professors would be Olympic champions. Since academic outsiders seldom observe this breathtaking &#8220;well-intentioned&#8221; mendacity, let me offer a case study of this dubious munificence. A recent New York Times story recounts a group of University of California-Berkeley professors endorsing spending billions for early childhood intervention to help struggling Hispanics. According to research on 8,114 infants, they found that while Hispanic children are intellectually similar to other American toddlers at age two, they quickly fall behind linguistically and cognitively. This gap then widens with age and, according to the research, is not a result of poor nutrition or parental neglect, the usual alleged culprits in cognitive gaps. Nor does poverty fully explain the divergence since even poor whites outshine Hispanics.</p>
<p>The difference, it is alleged, is a purely environmentally caused &#8220;disparity&#8221; that must be &#8220;attacked&#8221; before these youngsters mess up in elementary school  &mdash;  which, in practical terms, means lower incomes, etc., etc. In other words, being below average mentally is akin to, say, stunted growth due to a dietary deficiency and thus, at least in principle, remediable. Whether this gap is nature, nurture, or some mix is irrelevant since there is nothing about environmentally caused phenomena that makes them particularly remediable (doubters might review the history of U.S. public housing). {snip}</p>
<p>The Berkeley professors&rsquo; call for yet more early childhood intervention is hardly a voice in the wilderness. The Times also quotes Eugene Garcia, an education professor at Arizona State University who admits that the reason why Hispanic kids so quickly fall behind whites is unclear, but this uncertainty hardly deters him from likewise recommending early intercession. Carmen Rodriguez, director of Columbia University&rsquo;s Head Start Program, concurs: Toddlers from low-income families are doomed unless they receive early intellectual stimulation. {snip}</p>
<p>And Washington hardly objects. President Obama&rsquo;s appropriately named stimulus package included $3 billion for Head Start and Early Hard Start to help young parents stimulate their children&rsquo;s mental development, and not even skinflint Republicans object. {snip}</p>
<p>Now for a few facts from that awful, cold-hearted Ebenezer Scrooge:</p>
<p>Early intervention has not worked, and nothing suggests that tinkering and extravagant funding will reverse these failures. Head Start began in 1965. It has to date absorbed $167 billion, it is relentlessly scrutinized (annual assessments are legally required), and the failure verdict is indisputable. Similar disappointing results occurred even in much smaller labor-intensive projects, where youngsters intellectually lagging behind their peers received daily intellectual stimulation. One such intervention began at three months of age and transpired for seven hours a day, five days a week. When the children were a bit older, they attended a &#8220;stimulation center&#8221; from 9:00AM to 4:00PM every day of the year. Alas, by fourth grade, the value of this intensive intervention had vanished [2]. </p>
<p>A 1985 U.S. Department of Health and Human Service analysis found that the Head Start program&rsquo;s claim of long-term benefits was exaggerated, and this included increases in cognitive test scores and academic benefits plus such non-academic benefits as reducing crime, teen pregnancy, and unemployment [3]. Another study of Head Start completed in 2006 using a random assignment experimental design with 5,000 children did show some initial progress (using some 41 indicators of cognitive impact), but, yet one more time, the intellectual benefits vanished by the time children entered first grade [4]. And these two studies are typical. </p>
<p>What apparently fuels this optimism is not science, but mass media accounts from the likes of Newsweek desperate to find magic bullet solutions to racial/ethnic differences. Further, add entrepreneurs hawking IQ-boosting gimmicks to anxious parents (e.g., Mozart CDs for infants). {snip}</p>
<p>How can academics at respectable institutions get away with this mendacious fantasy? {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Obviously, the ideologically infused analysis suggests that the desire to expand the social welfare state, even if by quackery, has become so ingrained in certain academic departments (and the New York Times) that it resembles a religious faith. Nobody challenges the assumption that a racial/ethnic difference that favors the white middle class is &#8220;a problem&#8221; requiring government-funded solutions. Everything is just &#8220;compassionate&#8221; belief coupled with a moral imperative to spend government money. {snip}</p>
<p>The Head Start &#8220;solution&#8221; also betrays economic illiteracy. Is government-funded talk-to-kids-with-bigger-words intervention the superior tactic to close cognitive gaps? What about reducing taxes on small businesses so Juan and Juanita can become entrepreneurs, and with the newfound cash, move the family to a middle-class neighborhood so Juan Jr. can play with more linguistically advanced kids? Perhaps the family&rsquo;s newfound wealth could finance horizon-expanding travel versus having a social worker give Juan Jr. a second-hand account. If, as the authors claim, poverty is a key reason for the lack of intellectual stimulation, why not instead use the billions to cut taxes for the ambitious poor instead of hiring more government workers to meddle in family life? </p>
<p>To be frank, the &#8220;well-intentioned&#8221; professors just don&rsquo;t care about Hispanic kids. Expanding the social welfare state is paramount. {snip} These Berkeley professors are merely honoring politically correct gods and squandering billions combined while ignoring opportunity costs as irrelevant. Just imagine a Berkeley professor of education announcing that cognitive differences, regardless of source, are probably intractable, and so Hispanic youngsters, like every other human being, must make the best of their abilities. {snip}</p>

		<p>This illustrates what a horrible mess this dumbed down education system is in this country.</p>
<p>Nothing can be accomplished, because the PC crowd concentrates so heavily on racial issues of one kind or the other there&rsquo;s no time for anything else.  And, most of that wasted time is spent trying to convince everyone that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, afterwhich ALL their stats are broken down by race, and all they can do is talk about trying to solve one racial problem after another, assuring everybody that race has nothing to do with anything.</p>
<p>Are you ever forced to the conclusion that these people are all going to eventually have nervous breakdowns trying to remember all their lies?<br>

		<p>Not only is Head Start a waste of time and $ but the same could be said for the white yuppie parents who drill their 3 year olds w/flash cards and other gimmicks in order to get a leg-up on their future classmates.</p>
<p> Children who attend pre-school and/or kindergarten have no real advantages over kids who don&rsquo;t enter school until 1st grade.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;Just imagine a Berkeley professor of education announcing that cognitive differences, regardless of source, are probably intractable&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>A Berkeley professor did exactly that, Arthur Jensen, Professor Emeritus of Educational Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and for doing so he has paid a very heavy price.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Arthur Jensen of Berkeley, the dean of psychometricians with 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals, struggled merely to find a publisher for his version of The g Factor, this heroically comprehensive summing up of his life&rsquo;s work. Finally, the small mail order imprint Praeger released Jensen&rsquo;s magnum opus &hellip; to shameful neglect&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>For his research and conclusion that IQ and behavior traits are mostly hereditary, intractable and that there are distinct, race-based differences in intelligence, Jensen has been the victim of &#8220;assaults, threats, censorship, character assassination, and non-stop harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no doubt there are many many other scientists, psychometricians, educators, psychologists (if not most, given the thoroughness, years of research AND  empirical evidence such as the utter failure of early intervention programs) at all levels of academia and intelligensia that believe IQ is hereditary, intractable and is different between races but fear for their lives and reputations by publicly stating this.</p>
<p>Better to live a safe life and be rewarded with tenure, publication and accolades (like Gould) by toeing the PC lines of &#8216;There are no differences in Intelligence Between the Races!&rsquo; and &#8216;Non-White academic failure is due solely to environment and therefore more money needs to be poured into early intervention!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The PC line worked, worked well and was very lucrative for Gould. </p>

		<p>What these educated pendejos don&rsquo;t understand is that Hispanics, especially those most recently from Mexico, have no comprehension of what education means.  Their compulsory education in Mexico ends at the end of grade 6, so to them, what we&rsquo;d call a junior high student is &#8220;educated.&#8221;  With no value placed on education by the family, and no urging by the family for the child to learn English, in other words without strong family support, no Hispanic kid is going to be able to keep up with his white peers.  Of course, if the mother didn&rsquo;t have proper nutrition during pregnancy, which many don&rsquo;t, the chances of the child&rsquo;s brain developing normally are lessened.  And, if the child doesn&rsquo;t receive proper nutrition during the first 5 years of life, its little brain won&rsquo;t develop normally either.  That happens all the time.  So hey, you educated fools, change your focus and take an honest look at what the problem really is!</p>

<p>I suspect the reason they fall behind is not &#8220;unclear&#8221; at all. It is owing to racial differences in IQ. And also to cultural attitudes towards learning. And perhaps the fact that many Hispanic children have parents who came to the USA illegally causing an inability to assimilate into the American Way, such as it is these days.</p>
<p>Of course, the real beneficiaries of these social programs will be the Berkeley profs who are guaranteed cushy jobs and extended junkets as they &#8220;uplift&#8221; another sector of the underclass which they themselves have created via their advocacy of open borders and multicultism.</p>

<p>While I agree with most of the article, wouldn&rsquo;t it be even better for Juan and Juanita  &mdash;  presumably among the most ambitious and intelligent of their race  &mdash;  do better to return to Mexico to help improve their own country?  There are middle-class places in Mexico to live, too.</p>

		<p>I was a site manager for a Head Start program here in Chicago. Head Start not only deals with education; the program attempts to provide services to poor families in many aspects of their lives. We had a full time nurse, a nutritionist, a social-services coordinator and a disabilities coordinator. When a parent registers their child for Head Start, they spend over an hour detailing every aspect of their lives down to what they eat every day. The social service person, the nurse, etc&hellip; are paid to contact these parents and tell them how to eat healthy or encourage them to go back to school etc&hellip;    I never saw any family&rsquo;s life improve as a result of this intervention.  They were simply not interested in improving their lives.  In order to keep their jobs, these coordinators would often fake paperwork to make it appear as if more parents were being helped. </p>

		<p>I was in Head Start myself, in the Detroit area&hellip;yet I had already been reading by the time I started.  I&rsquo;ve always been a curious person, and I had parents who helped me learn (they did not force me).</p>
<p>I believe parents should be responsible for their children&rsquo;s education.  I&rsquo;d like to homeschool my second-grader but can&rsquo;t; however, I do try to take time to teach him things.</p>

<p>And why should money be taken from my family and given to these Mexican so that they can eat better?  Isn&rsquo;t that the job of the Mexican government?  </p>
<p>How about this:  because of the oppressive tax burden (for social programs) in this country, both my wife and I must work full time and often on weekends.  This takes us away from our own children, whose little brains are developing and need the love and stimulation from his parents.  So, I must sacrifice brain development of my own kids to assure that Mexican children have better brain development?  </p>
<p>Also, if it were not for massive immigration of wage-slaves from Mexico who depress salaries, I might be able to earn enough money to stay home on weekends and be with my children.</p>

		<p><i>If, as the authors claim, poverty is a key reason for the lack of intellectual stimulation, why not instead use the billions to <strong>cut taxes for the ambitious poor</strong> instead of hiring more government workers to meddle in family life?</i></p>
<p>What taxes? If a poor person works and files taxes, they can get a sizeable refund of not only what they paid, but more, due to:</p>
<p>a) The standard deduction and exemptions on the 1040 form, for a married couple is $18,700 for the 2009 tax year, which exempts a whole lot of income for a &#8220;poor&#8221; person.</p>
<p>b) The Earned Income Credit, which doesn&rsquo;t even require having a dependent child anymore. That alone can offset and state sales and income tax, as well as FICA and Medicare taxes.</p>
<p>So, in some case, they pay absolutely no tax at all, or nearly none, and in other cases may end up being paid rather that paying anything at all. No real tax burden here.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I agree with the idea of getting rid of &#8220;government workers to meddle in family life&#8221;.  That kind of stuff only spells trouble. Of course, it&rsquo;s part of Hillary&rsquo;s cradle to grave education scheme, otherwise known as &#8220;Lifetime Learning&#8221;.</p>
<p>It does burn me to read about the $167 billon this article states has been wasted on Head Start since its inception. That money would be better left in taxpayer&rsquo;s pockets to do something useful (preaching to the choir here), but what does goverment care? It&rsquo;s only Other Peoples Money (OPM).</p>

<p>Also, if the government didn&rsquo;t provide cradle-to-grave welfare for uneducated Mexican imigrants and thier many, many children, your taxes would not be so high, and thus you would not need to work so much, which would allow you to spend more time with your children.  </p>
<p>However, our government does not care about you or your children   &mdash;   You don&rsquo;t have the correct skin color.  What the USA government really cares about is the welfare of the children of the people of Mexico.  Our government feels that the best way to provide for Mexicans is to import them by the Millions into the USA.</p>

<p>Exactly.  We&rsquo;re not getting the best of the Mexicans coming across our borders - we&rsquo;re getting the lowest of the peasants.  The illegals I&rsquo;ve seen over the last few years are even shorter and darker-skinned that the illegals I saw 10 yrs ago.  We&rsquo;re getting low-IQ Indians with little white admixture, who are often illiterate in their own language.  </p>
