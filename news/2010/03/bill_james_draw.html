<h1>Bill James Draws Controversy with Remarks on Herpes Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>April Bethea, Charlotte Observer, March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recently released survey on the high rate of herpes cases in Mecklenburg Country drew controversy this week after county commissioner Bill James suggested blacks are more likely to become infected with the disease because they are &#8220;more promiscuous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some worry that attention paid to James&rsquo; comments could overshadow the larger message of the new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that an estimated one in six Americans has herpes and black women have the highest rate of infection at 48 percent.</p>
<p>James wrote about the CDC survey in two e-mail messages sent to more than 2,000 people this week, taking umbrage with comments from a CDC official saying the higher rate of infection among blacks is not due to increased risky behavior. The health agency said biological factors make women more susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases like herpes, and the higher prevalence of the disease within the black community probably perpetuates racial disparities.</p>
<p>James accused the media and black leaders of downplaying what he alleges are the real reason for high numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is worse in the African-American community because there is more promiscuous behavior,&#8221; James wrote, &#8220;and it has to be fixed there and programs have to be tailor (sic) there.&#8221;</p>
<p>James has drawn criticism before over comments toward homosexuals and the black community.</p>

		<p>Bill James is right, folks.  The promiscuity rate in the male homosexual community is incredibly high; in the B.A. (Before AIDS) days, there were MANY guys who had as many as 6 partners in one night.  Night after night!!!  I know &#8216;cuz I was there.  I also know that sexual activity in the black community starts at an astoundingly young age, and continues all thru the teenage years.  Whites call it promiscuity, and blacks call it natural.  By whatever name, it&rsquo;s a stupid choice, because so many blacks end up with (a) herpes/STD&rsquo;s, and (b) children when they themselves are not yet of legal age.  That kills their chances of getting enough education to get into a decent-paying career.  It is NOT &#8220;cultural&#8221; to make stupid choices, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.  Both blacks and gay men need to wise up, BUT they won&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t want anyone stepping on their &#8220;right&#8221; to sexual activity with whom, when and how they choose - regardless of the consequences.</p>

		<p>This is one of those issues that is hard to blame whitey for.  Some areas where there was a legacy of discrimination, blacks and the media have dug in defensivly clinging onto their &#8220;victim&#8221; status.  I am sure blacks and the Democrats will eventually blame this on Reagan or McCain.  Anyone but blacks.   </p>

		<p>The Alfred Kinsey Institute is a research organization that has an abundance of statistics on sex. I went to their website and discovered the following information:</p>
<p><b>Average Age of First Intercourse by Race</b><br>
White: 16.6<br>
Black: 15.8<br>
Hispanic: 17<br>
Asian: 18.1</p>
<p>While the average age doesn&rsquo;t determine the amount of a race&rsquo;s promiscuity, it does give a good indication.</p>
<p>You can see these statistics here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#Age" rel="nofollow">https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#Age</a></p>
<p>Also, the out-of-wedlock rate for blacks is at around 70%, which definitely indicates a lot of  promiscuity and lewd sex.</p>

		<p>Almost 1/2 of ALL black women have herpes?  </p>
<p>Absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Instead of commenting on how best to prevent even more infections, the PC crowd tries to make excuses for it.</p>
<p>A vast percentage of black women are unmarried.  Maybe this is the reason why.</p>

		<p>The Charlotte Observer had an article on line a few days ago where they published the heated e mails between Willie Ratchford and Bill James. I wish I could find that link, because Bill makes ole Willie look like the truth denying fool he is. Of course Willie resorts to name calling, where Bill tells him to call him whatever he pleases, that the facts are there and he doesn&rsquo;t loose any sleep over name calling.</p>
<p><br>
Bill reminds me of former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCorory, when he made a statement about the crime rate being so high in majority black neighborhoods. The NAACP tried to act all offended and demanded an apology. Pat promptly refused, and said he would not apologize for speaking the truth and that he had the crime reports and statistics to prove it. What a shame he wasn&rsquo;t elected Governor of NC.</p>

		<p>It must be that the &#8216;biological factors&rsquo; make black women more susceptible to the white devil&rsquo;s black magic. Either that, or blacks are more promiscuous! </p>
<p>I will not be surprised if I hear urban rumors that the high rate of STDs are somehow the fault of Whites. I&rsquo;ve already heard that my kin can magically control HIV infections, weather, and earthquakes.</p>

<p>Okay, let me get this straight - so they are blaming racial inequality of some undefined type for this problem?</p>
<p>Also, Latinos are INCREDIBLY promiscuous.  I work around 90% latinos.  Sex is in the air so thick you can cut it with a bowieknife.</p>

		<p>The CDC probably employs some of the world&rsquo;s best statisticians and epidemologists, and only releases data if it is of the highest rigor and confidence limits.<br>
 Therefore it is curious to read some of the more hysteric comments trying to claim that somehow the study was &#8216;flawed&rsquo; by inconsistent sampling etc, claims made by people who probably don&rsquo;t have much of a background in the science of statistics and sampling.</p>

<p>I for one, do not buy those statistics whatsoever! 17 years of age for Hispanics? Come on! How about 12 years of age? Same with Asians and blacks. Whites are also catching up with those 3 groups, sad to say.</p>

		<p>Here is the email discussion in question.  However, it is not an enlightening discussion, and your time would be better spent looking at actual scientific explanations.</p>
<p>The studies <a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/2001/04000/Demographic_rather_than_behavioral_risk_factors.10.aspx" rel="nofollow">Sucato et al</a> and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Fulltext/2008/12001/Epidemiology_of_STD_Disparities_in_African.6.aspx" rel="nofollow">Newman et al</a> show that sexual risk factors do not fully explain sexually transmitted infection disparities, which could be further explained by biological factors.  However, the latter study summarizes research confirming that African Americans do engage more often in certain risk behaviors like sex before age 13 (16.5% versus 4.0% for whites).</p>
<p>One fact that seems lost on everyone is that the CDC study was only on Herpes simplex 2.  About 21% of heterosexual women with genital herpes have Herpes simplex 1 infection.  Of course, many of the women without genital herpes have another sexually transmitted infection.</p>

<p>You can blame the msm for airing the hysterical comments when it should be reporting dispassionately about a serious health problem in the black community (rampant STIs, due to high rates of black promiscuity).</p>
<p>According to the CDC:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In 2007, approximately 48% of all chlamydia cases occurred among blacks&hellip; more than eight times that of whites. </p>
<p>In 2007, approximately 70% of the total number of reported cases of gonorrhea occurred among blacks&hellip; 19 times greater than that among whites.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2007, the rate of P&S; syphilis among blacks increased 25.0% &hellip; 46.0% of all cases of P&S; syphilis reported to CDC were among blacks&hellip; rate for blacks was 7.0 times higher than for Whites. </p>
<p>In 2007, the rate of congenital syphilis are 14 and 6.6 times higher [black and hispanic], respectively, than the 2007 rate among whites</p>
<p>The rate of AIDS diagnoses for black adults/adolescents were 10 times the rate for whites. The rate of AIDS diagnoses for black women was 22 times the rate for white women. Blacks accounted for 44% of people living with AIDS in the 50 states and District of Columbia&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9uxpfx" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y9uxpfx</a></p>
<p>To widely publicize this is racism.</p>
<p>It reminds me of gay activists in the 1980s, those who had NO medical background or knowledge of public health who were given unlimited time in the media to express &#8216;outrage&rsquo;, blame Ronald Reagan for the AIDS epidemic and demand that the bath houses in SF be kept open (which they were for a long time).   </p>
<p>Anyone who deigned to focus on the dire consequences of not warning gay men about AIDS were shouted down and called bigoted, insensitive and homo-phobic.  One gay doctor said he watched as patients he had diagnosed with the HIV virus continue to stream into bath houses to infect unsuspecting men.</p>
<p>Yeah, STIs are racist  &mdash;  they prefer black behavior over White.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always been very confused about this particular stereotype. <br>
The word ho runs rampant in the black community so I&rsquo;m surprised that more women aren&rsquo;t buckling under the threat of it.  In the white world it seems like the term slut is sort of a compliment now.  The word ho is still a very vicious insult.  All the black women I have known have been prudes so I guess they must hide their stuff very well, presumably because of the word ho.</p>

		<p>There may be sygergistic effects at work here; the presence of any untreated venereal disease that leaves open sores will of course make it easier to contract other STDs.  Beginning sexual activity while in the early teens means it is very likely one will make some serious errors in deciding whom to sleep with (kids make all sorts of other judgement errors; why would this issue be any different?)  Then there&rsquo;s drug use; when someone who is drunk and/or high, the first thing to go by the wayside is judgement, whether over one is fit to drive a car or over whether a potential partner should be avoided.  Disaster analysis usually shows that quite a large number of things had to go wrong to cause them.  We may be seeing that here as well.</p>
