<h1>Judge Stacks Prison Sentences for George Thomas in Torture-Slayings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They died separately, and George Thomas should die in prison for both, a judge ruled today.</p>
<p>Knox County Criminal Court Judge Richard Baumgartner opted after a sentencing hearing to stack the two life without parole sentences handed Thomas by a jury in December.</p>
<p>He also sentenced Thomas to 25 years for crimes related the January 2007 slayings of Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23, but that sentence will run concurrently to the life terms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m of the opinion Mr. Thomas along with Mr. Cobbins and Mr. Davidson are dangerous offenders who had no hesitation, absolutely none, when these two young people were raped and killed,&#8221; Baumgartner said.</p>
<p>The remaining defendant, Vanessa Coleman, faces a May trial. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davidson has been sentenced to death in the case. Cobbins is serving life without parole in the murders as well as the additional 100 years for the kidnapping, robbery and rapes leading up to the deaths.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Third killer in Knoxville Horror gets two life sentences without parole.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine this creep is feeling pretty good about himself right now.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because incarceration to a dull-witted thug isn&rsquo;t punishment.  It&rsquo;s a reward of sorts.  He&rsquo;s too stupid to care for himself, but now he gets free room and board, plus recreational activities, including movies and T.V., that he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have in such abundance if he remained on the streets.</p>

<p>Knowing the penal system, he, and any others, will likely be parolled in less than 10 years to make room for insurrectionist Whites.</p>

<p>This and other films like &#8220;To Kill a Mocking Bird&#8221;  show only white on black violence, and if rape is involved, it is a white women&rsquo;s false accusation against a black man.</p>
<p>One thing we never see is black on white violence, or as in this Nashville case, barbarism. I doubt this will change anytime soon.</p>

		<p>A clear sign of the moral cowardice of this nation, is our inability to execute even the most savage and beastial of killers. <br>
This ambulatory piece of excrement is surely among the worst ever, yet we wil pay for it to live on in prison. Just think, fellow suckers and perpetual victims; we will pay for this thing to have all it&rsquo;s needs met, while it conspires to rape/sodomize other inmates, and stab people in the neck, and maybe dream of breaking out, to mutilate more white folks.<br>

		<p>If this case doesn&rsquo;t merit the death penalty, none does.</p>
<p>I hope they are killed painfully in prison, but as was pointed out above, they will probably enjoy their time there.</p>

Anonymous,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so right!! I have numerous times suggested that maybe the families of these victims need to begin to exact their own justice since it&rsquo;s painfully obvious that our &#8220;Justice&#8221; system has no intention of giving us any or at least none to Euro- Americans. My posts never make it to the screen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve observed all of Amren&rsquo;s guidelines. I don&rsquo;t use obscenities, nor do I insult groups or individuals unless the individuals include rapist murderers of innocent women. Surely these groups need to be insulted and threatened. They sure as Hell aren&rsquo;t being intimidated by the &#8220;Justice&#8221; system! How many young women have been murdered, gang raped, beaten and tortured over the last ten years?  We learn only about the ones that are so hideous that they can&rsquo;t be buried and, when the perpetrator is Black, they quickly disappear from the &#8220;radar screen&#8221;. The Wichita and Knoxville cases are among the most horrible examples of savagery in the history of this country. People were shocked by the Loeb and Leopold case during the early part of the last century and by dramatic incidents like Charles Starkweather. They pale in comparison to what befell the Wichita victims, Channon and Christopher, Eve Carson, Lauren Burk and others ad infinitum,<br>
I don&rsquo;t care what we do about health care reform and job creation. If the descendents of the people who made this country what it is can&rsquo;t walk the streets of their own cities and towns and if they can&rsquo;t go to and from their &#8220;jobs&#8221; safely, the whole exercise is pointless.<br>

		<p>George Thomas will be welcome in prison by The Nation of Islam, I mean really being isnturmental in the slaying of two white people.<br>
    They will make A role model of him he will be A hero for young <br>
recruits. He will be nurtured and contraband will be smuggled to him ( food etc;) his nasty attitude will serve him well,he will most likely end up as A bodyguard for one of the  ministers, they love weak minded mongrels who will blindly follow them.He will write articles from his cell about the white man. How the white man and the white powder was his downfall,they will be published in the final call.<br>
      People awake see what these people are doing to us.</p>

		<p>I agree with anonymous #4 and #6.  I will add that as long as things like this are moving around alive, there is a possibility they will one day walk free.  If not, they will surely live a good life in prison around their types, as other posters have stated. <br>
 <br>
Given their notoriety, a few dumb white girls will start prison correspondence affairs that will end in marriage and conjugal visits.  We will all be blessed with mixed race kids at taxpayers&rsquo; expense as well.<br>
    <br>
The chance of these elemental slim going free one day is farfetched?  Not really.  Out of the blue a Federal Judge could suddenly order prison population reduction for one reason or another.  The lifers could have a shortened sentence and some would be immediately released.  It has happened before.  The felons in this case could be bestowed a shorter sentence or even released as well.  </p>
<p>Another possibility is that with tax shortfalls there will be pressure on the state to release felons to save money.  So, the only way to be sure about this pestilence is swift execution.  But Tennessee cowardly failed on this account except for one of the felons, Davidson. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hold your breath.  Tennessee political whores are too cowardly to carry out the sentence on this human debris. Down the road a few years when nobody is watching his sentence will be reduced to life.  He may even get a new trial and walk.   </p>
<p>There are other possibilities as well that may be on the horizon.  In Obama&rsquo;s second, third, or fourth term, with passage of the Federal &ldquo;Sentencing and Prison Population Equalization Act&rdquo; prison residents will have to be &ldquo;Normalized&rdquo; to mirror the racial makeup of the state.  </p>
<p>The thinking will be that if justice were truly equal, inmate populations would reflect this proportional reality.  So there you have it, these perpetrators may walk so a balance can be achieved.   </p>
<p>Obama will be term limited out after eight years?  Don&rsquo;t bet on it.  After eight years in office he will have appointed at least two more &ldquo;Justices&rdquo; to the Supreme Court.  No one should be surprised at what can be found in the emanations and penumbras of the 22 amendment by a group of motivated supreme dorks.    </p>
<p>Of course the death penalty will also be ruled unconstitutional.  This to placate the UN and the racial justice industry.  </p>
<p>As a side note, I&rsquo;ve noticed recently that the list of scheduled executions in Texas is becoming more and more racially balanced, all while the white population of the state is proportionally shrinking.  Not too long ago the list was composed of mostly black inmates; but lately it has been sprinkled with a lot of whites and more and more Hispanics.  </p>
<p>I suspect this is done to deflect critics who have maintained for years that only the &ldquo;poor black man&rdquo; is executed, having been put there by a racist jury and prosecutor.   The state and its politicos have a vested interest in deflecting the racist brand.  Hence there is political and social pressure to equalize executions by race.   </p>
<p>Of course the consequences will be to make it easier for blacks to be commuted to life over whites since more blacks than whites end up on death row.  Once a white is on death row, he will stay there and play his part in the balancing act until he dies one way or the other. <br>

		<p>  The &#8220;Justice&#8221; Dept. should be more transparent and truthfully rename themselves &#8220;The Just Us&#8221; Dept. Increasingly all they seem to care about is extreme leftist notions of &#8220;social justice&#8221; another conveniently undefined term like &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
