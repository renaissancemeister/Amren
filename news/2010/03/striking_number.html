<h1>Striking Number of Obesity Risks Hit Minority Kids</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lindsey Tanner, San Francisco Chronicle, March 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The odds of obesity appear stacked against black and Hispanic children starting even before birth, provocative new research suggests.</p>
<p>The findings help explain disproportionately high obesity rates in minority children. Family income is often a factor, but so are cultural customs and beliefs, the study authors said.</p>
<p>They examined more than a dozen circumstances that can increase chances of obesity, and almost every one was more common in black and Hispanic children than in whites. Factors included eating and sleeping habits in infancy and early childhood and mothers smoking during pregnancy</p>
<p>In a separate, equally troubling study, researchers found signs of inflammation in obese children as young as 3 years old. High levels were more common in blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>These inflammatory markers have been linked with obesity in adults and are thought to increase chances for developing heart disease. Their significance in early childhood is uncertain, but the study&rsquo;s lead author says she never thought they&rsquo;d be found in children so young.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The results suggest that 3-year-olds with inflammation might already have artery changes that could make then prone to later heart problems, although that needs to be examined in future research, she said.</p>
<p>Both studies were released Monday in the journal Pediatrics.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
Twenty percent of black and Hispanic children ages 2 to 19 are obese, versus 15 percent of whites, recent government data show.</p>
<p>In the racial disparities study, risk factors examined included: mothers smoking during pregnancy; unusually rapid weight gain in young infants; starting solid food before 4 months; mothers&rsquo; routinely pressuring young kids to eat more; children sleeping less than 12 hours daily between 6 months and 2 years; and allowing very young kids to have sugary drinks, fast-food, and/or TVs in their rooms.</p>
<p>Minorities were at higher risk than whites for nearly every one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many circumstances studied are more common in low-income, less educated families, including whites. Taveras said the researchers accounted for that and still found race was frequently a factor regardless of income.</p>
<p>The results may reflect cultural beliefs or influence from grandparents on feeding practices, but the good news, she said, is that almost every risk factor studied can be changed.</p>

<p>This reader of Vdare sort of hit the nail on the head when it comes to welfare feeding programs. My belief is that big corporate food processing interests are the primary beneficiaries of welfare feeding anyway.</p>

<p>This explains why this Michelle Obama has made obesity a priority.  She&rsquo;s all over the T.V. talking about it.</p>
<p>Are these people so totally and completely consumed by race that they can focus on nothing else?<br>

<p>They are lactose intolerant and trying to eat a dairy based diet which is not meant for them.</p>
<p>They metabolize the same foods a different way.</p>
<p>This sort of stuff is well understood and has been for some time. And yet everyone scratches their head and wonders WHY!</p>

<p>First Lady Michelle Obama said that the reason we need to reduce youth obesity is because obese children can&rsquo;t do very well in the military, so obesity is now a national security issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that the left wing didn&rsquo;t have a cow over that comment.  After all, opposition to the U.S. military is the left&rsquo;s second holiest sacrament, only behind St. Abortion itself.  I&rsquo;d hate to be someone like Markos What&rsquo;s-His-Face and read that Michelle Obama&rsquo;s crusade against child obesity today is related to the Armed Forces&rsquo;s staffing concerns in 2020.  Also, can we take this as a clue that her husband isn&rsquo;t going to get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan?  Why do we even need a military at all if the world&rsquo;s gonna love us because of the power of Barack Obama&rsquo;s personality?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Minorities were AT higher risk than whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>                   OR</p>
<p>Minorities TAKE higher risks than whites?</p>
<p>Some pretty slick NewSpeak here; an example of the clever language manipulation we&rsquo;re subliminally bombarded with constantly from government, academia, and the media.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the &#8220;striking number&#8221; referred to in the headline?  Whites are only 5% less likely than blacks and hispanics to be &#8220;victimized&#8221; by this particular boogey man.</p>
<p>Only in an incredibly affluent society could poverty be accompanied by obesity.  And because we&rsquo;re talking about an American phenomenon, our conclusion must infer that somehow, the villain is  &mdash;  always was, and always will be  &mdash;  the racist white man.    </p>

<p>Because poor people eat McDonald&rsquo;s.  All they can afford is what&rsquo;s on the dollar menu.  People wonder why they don&rsquo;t just eat apples but fruits don&rsquo;t really cut through hunger.  A diet of fruits and veggies is usually more expensive because you need to eat in bulk.</p>

<p>Nothing really surprising about it when we consider the real agenda at work. The people who control America aren&rsquo;t all that concerned with &#8216;ideological purity&rsquo;; they&rsquo;re willing to do anything to keep their grip on the multicultural monstrosity that is the United States. They know that they have a tiger by the tail, and they dare not let go. Behind all the rhetoric is an underlying goal to &#8216;make this all work&rsquo; without the entire country coming apart. </p>
<p>In truth, they really couldn&rsquo;t care less about war as an ideological matter. Remember, the same exact people who so vigorously supported WWII were the same people who so vehemently opposed to the Vietnam conflict&hellip;.<br>
