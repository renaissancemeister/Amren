<p>The American Immigration Control Foundation has established itself as the premier publisher of trenchant monographs on immigration. Brent Nelson&rsquo;s <cite>America Balkanized</cite> is one of the best volumes on the subject now available and is a worthy successor to Lawrence Auster&rsquo;s <cite>The Path to National Suicide,</cite> published by AICF in 1990.</p>

</table><p>Dr. Nelson calls his book an essay on &#8220;the problems of governance in the multi-ethnic state which will arise in the United States if immigration is not curtailed.&#8221; Drawing on examples from history, current events, and even sociobiology, he argues that America&rsquo;s immigration policy cannot help but create conflicts &#8220;of such dimensions as to be insoluble within the traditional limits of American governance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people have pointed out that massive non-white immigration could destroy the United States. Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s contribution is in articulating the principles that make destruction inevitable  &mdash;  if current policies continue  &mdash;  and in exploring some of the ways American elites deceive themselves into thinking that all is well.</p>
<p><b>North American Mammals</b></p>
<p>What could be called the leitmotif of the book comes from a surprising but persuasive source: <cite>The Mammals of North America,</cite> written by a professor of biology at the University of Kansas named Raymond Hall. This volume, which Dr. Nelson tells us is the definitive work in the field, arrives at one conclusion so emphatically that Prof. Hall italicizes in the original: <em>Two subspecies of the same species do not occur in the same geographic area.</em> Similar strains of squirrel or fox do not occupy the same ecological niche for long. Very occasionally they interbreed and produce a new subspecies, but usually one will destroy or simply displace the other.</p>
<p>Prof. Hall applies this rule to the human mammals of North America. &#8220;To imagine one subspecies of man living together on equal terms for long with another subspecies is but wishful thinking and leads only to disaster and oblivion for one or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is very unusual to find such a categorical dismissal of attempts to create multiethnic societies. To a thoughtful biologist, however, sustained non-white immigration into the United States is a fatal violation of Nature&rsquo;s balance. Much of the conflict we see not only in the United States but around the world is the reassertion of the mammalian nature of man in the face of repeated attempts to deny it.</p>

</table><p>Dr. Nelson points out that it is not just the recent cheer-leaders for the &#8220;end of history&#8221; who have been tempted to ignore biology, but every classical sociological theorist from Marx and Spencer to Weber and Durkheim: &#8220;The underground survival of the ethnic factor in Eastern Europe (and elsewhere) and its sudden explosive re-emergence in separatism, irredentism, rioting, and civil war has confounded all the classical theories of sociology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike animals, human beings do not need anything so obvious as biology in order to assert group distinctions. Populations that are racially identical can fragment murderously because of religion or language.</p>
<p>Of all the world&rsquo;s peoples, it is probably only whites who ever believed that the &#8220;ethnic factor&#8221; could be made not to matter. Americans, in particular, seem to believe that heterogeneity is not the slightest obstacle to national unity, and that a nation&rsquo;s spirit can expand infinitely to accommodate all comers. Dr. Nelson quotes Jeane Kirkpatrick as follows: &#8220;Only those who do not understand America believe that families that have been here for 10 generations are more American than the tens of thousands of new citizens naturalized last year.&#8221; In other words, <em>anyone</em> can instantly become <em>completely</em> American.</p>
<p>Many of those tens of thousands of naturalized citizens have no such illusions. They know they bring immutable characteristics that may not affect the legal American state but that permanently change the American nation. &#8220;What color is to blacks, language is to Hispanics,&#8221; explains Maurice Ferre, former mayor of Miami. &#8220;We could come back in 100 years and the Latinos will not have assimilated in the classic sense,&#8221; says the head of the Chicano [Mexican-American] Studies Research Center at UCLA.</p>
<p>Some immigrants are openly contemptuous of the culture and history to which Mrs. Kirkpatrick seems to think they will smoothly assimilate. Ricardo Chavira, who writes for <cite>Time</cite> magazine, says: &#8220;Imagine the ludicrousness of an elementary school teacher telling a room full of Chicanos that George Washington and company were our Founding Fathers. Obviously, those guys in matching white wigs were no fathers of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Chicanos intend to follow the logic of anti-assimilation to its obvious conclusion; they fully expect steady Hispanic immigration to push whites out of the Southwest and to bring complete Hispanic domination. Although it is not clear whether the Southwest would then reattach itself to Mexico or become an independent nation, Chicanos already have a name for their nation: Aztlan, which means &#8220;the bronze continent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson quotes a 1982 article in <cite>Excelsior,</cite> Mexico&rsquo;s leading daily, that anticipates the same victory:<blockquote>&#8220;The territory lost in the XIX century .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seems to be restoring itself through humble people who go on settling various zones that once were ours on the old maps.</p>
<p> &#8220;Land, under any concept of possession, ends up in the hands of those who deserve it.&#8221;

</table><p>White Americans are not even putting up a token resistance to reconquest; they have granted to illegal aliens all the social benefits of citizens. Dr. Nelson reports further that when the Texas legislature passed a Buy American-Buy Texan law, it treated Mexico as part of the United States. Likewise, it voted to let Mexican nationals pay in-state tuition at five Texas state universities near the border, thus establishing the principal of treating aliens better than American citizens from other states.</p>
<p>Dr. Nelson explains that as long ago as the 1960s, Chicanos realized that conquest would not require desperate measures because whites were willing partners in their own dispossession. Activists have instead opted for what they call &#8220;the long march through the institutions,&#8221; that is, establishment of Chicano Studies Departments, naturalization, seizure of majorities on school boards, and massive voter support for co-racialists.</p>
<p>Their confidence is based not just on sheer numbers but on how those numbers are distributed. In Houston, Texas, for example, Hispanics were only one fifth of the population in 1985. However, they accounted for one third of the children in the Houston School District, and <em>more than half</em> of the first-graders. Hispanics need only wait for the Southwest to fall into their hands. Before long, vast regions of the country will reflect what is now only a local phenomenon: Those who are to be &#8220;assimilated&#8221; outnumber those who are presumably to do the assimilating.</p>
<p>This demographic transformation has been greatly assisted by proponents  &mdash;  mostly white  &mdash;  of &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221; In Dr. Nelson&rsquo;s view, former Marxists have simply rechanneled their hatred of capitalism into hatred of Western Civilization, and with equally destructive intent:<blockquote>&#8220;After the transformation of America which they advocate has been effected, American civilization will no longer have its formerly European character. American civilization will have been effectively abolished.&#8221;
</blockquote>Multiculturalism is promoted with a tremendous propaganda effort meant to convince whites that the displacement of their culture is either inevitable or is appropriate punishment for their sins.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;America is Unique&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Dr. Nelson devotes a considerable part of his book to the question of what defines a nation. He quotes John Jay, writing in 1787 in <cite>The Federalist Papers:</cite> &#8220;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people, a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jay recognized that these are the ties that bind nations together. Today, whites have begun to realize that America can no longer lay claim to any of the old ties. So-called conservatives, who do not share the multiculturalists zeal for the destruction of Western Civilization, find themselves in the absurd position of claiming that a third-world population can still, somehow, be &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than admit that the disappearance of Jay&rsquo;s common bonds means the dissolution of America, they claim that the country is uniquely exempt from the need for common bonds. What then makes America American? Dr. Nelson cites the economist Robert J. Samuelson: &#8220;Prosperity is what binds us together.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be hard to think of a more threadbare basis for national unity. No nation enjoys eternal prosperity. Its true test is adversity. By Mr. Samuelson&rsquo;s definition, the United States could not survive another depression or protracted war. It may not even survive mild recession. In Mr. Samuelson&rsquo;s terms, the United States is strictly a business interest; if it stops being profitable, it can be liquidated. Whether he knows it or not, Mr. Samuelson is admitting that America is no longer a nation.</p>
<p>The thesis of American uniqueness, to which scholars and politicians cling with increasing desperation, does have some basis in history. America did manage to blend Europeans into a cohesive nation, despite the conflicts that continued to wrack Europe. However, as Dr. Nelson points out, this blending took place under ideal circumstances. The new Americans were of the same race (or subspecies, to use Prof. Hall&rsquo;s terminology) and the Western frontier served as a safety valve for ethnic friction. Today&rsquo;s newcomers are not only racially  &mdash;  and therefore permanently  &mdash;  different, they are pouring into a nation that is increasingly crowded and exhausted.</p>

    </tr>
</table> <p>The promise of American uniqueness is false. One of the signs of approaching dissolution is the extent to which the role of government has become mediation between hostile groups. The reigning theory of the last several decades has been that &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; &#8220;sensitivity,&#8221; and &#8220;openness&#8221; can bring a permanent solution to racial conflict. There is, of course, no sign of permanent solution. Dr. Nelson points out that races are &#8220;political conflict groups&#8221; that are &#8220;already pre-organized by Nature.&#8221; Racial friction is therefore an abiding addition to the normal political disagreements found even in homogeneous nations.</p>
<p>It is not as though the mainstream media are unaware of this. For example, they duly report that during one 18-month period in the town of Long Beach, California, there were 55 drive-by shootings as part of a feud between Cambodian and Hispanic gangs. Long Beach was once so overwhelmingly white it was called Iowa by the Sea. The astonishing thing is that the degeneration of a homogeneous, prosperous white city into a racial battleground for aliens does not provoke calls for the restoration of homogeneity. Instead, government takes on the increasingly futile task of papering over racial antagonisms. This is the cost of pretending that humans are not mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government in a multi-ethnic state must grow ever more intrusive, ever larger, and ever more costly, simply in order to preserve the political integrity of the state,&#8221; writes Dr. Nelson. Every act of government becomes a racial juggling act, a distribution of spoils to each group according to mathematical formulae.</p>
<p>To the extent that multi-ethnic states work at all, they require the indulgence of the majority. Dr. Nelson quotes historian Hans Kohn: &#8220;Fundamental for the solution of problems of duo- or polyethnic states is not primarily the attitude of the minority or minorities but that of the majority. The weaker groups in the population must receive a greater consideration than would be proportional to their numerical strength.&#8221; Dr. Nelson notes that this is true in Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada, as well as the United States.</p>
<p>Here, the game of exploiting the majority has become so attractive that groups other than races now play it. Homosexuals, feminists, and handicapped people have all copied blacks and Hispanics and now demand special favors in the name of &#8220;victimhood.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>America Without Americans</b></p>
<p>Where will it end? Dr. Nelson predicts that as their numbers dwindle, whites will eventually demand from their leaders the racial aggressiveness typical of non-whites. It is only the nostalgic attachment of the white majority for the idea of a united America, the illusion that it is still possible to have a government that speaks for Americans of all races, that gives the country even the appearance of unity. These nostalgic illusions will be torn away by the ruthless consolidation of power by non-whites:<blockquote>&#8220;When .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. European Americans begin to think of themselves as such and demand ethnically conscious European American leaders, then America will have become America Balkanized, a nation without Americans, just as Yugoslavia, in the early 1990s, became a nation without Yugoslavs; i.e. no longer a viable nation.&#8221;
</blockquote>Awakened white consciousness may not come for several decades. Because America  &mdash;  with its forms, its trappings of government, its national symbols and slogans  &mdash;  derives almost exclusively from European sources, whites will be the last to abdjure the realm and abandon the current notion of what America is supposed to be. They will cling to the image of an &#8220;inclusive,&#8221; &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; all-absorbing America  &mdash;  but only at their peril. No one else plays by those rules. As Prof. Hall reminds us, any attempt by two human subspecies to live side by side &#8220;leads only to disaster and oblivion for one or the other.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think this article misses the obvious.  Very quickly, those conflicts are going to give rise to ethnostates.  The groundwork has already begun.  Or, put another way, how many whites live in &#8220;multi-ethnic&#8221; neighborhoods as opposed to moving away to be in majority white neighborhoods?</p>
<p>My point is there is a very wide gap between what we are doing and what we are pretending we are doing.</p>
<p>That won&rsquo;t last&hellip;..especially now that the economy has crashed.</p>

		<p>I think about this issue all the time.  I grew up not too long ago (80&rsquo;s).  I&rsquo;m not a senior citizen, but in such a short space of time I feel dispossessed of my own country.  I see the break up the nation.  I see terrible wars.  I see nuclear bombs on our cities dropped by people from here.</p>
<p>In my estimation, the war will begin when a collection of northern mostly white states are fed up and try to secede.  Then the mostly nonwhite federal government will be in the position of waging war on the last white stronghold of the country.  (They will use the example of the Civil War to justify not letting those states go.)  The federal government&rsquo;s army will be 80-90% non-white, and those people will kill and rape the whites during their invasion with impunity.  Think &#8220;Tears of the Sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>This catastrophe and subsequent destruction of the last vestige fo the white tax base will cause the federal government to collapse, then various army commanders will revolt, other regions (non-white) will revolt, and it will devolve into a messy pogrom-for all for several years until loose racial entities are formed.</p>
<p>The few surviving white liberals will ask, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;  And they will retreat to any pockets of white resistance left, and then subsequently spread their poison further.</p>

Exactly. The nation will frature into several ethnic states. I predict a liberal  all-races state, a couple of all white states, one very strictly white, the other a bit lenient.</p>
<p> Another will be Latino, and somewhere in between, a hellish black state, which will be cordoned off by all other states.</p>
<p>The  all-whites state will be the only one to keep it together. The lenient white state will either falter and get strict, or collapse, due to squabbling.  The Latino state will be a carbon copy of the corruption and chaos of Mexico.Eventually, they&rsquo;ll be illegally migrating to the all-races liberal state, and it will collapse even quicker thus. The Latino state will go millitant and wage war on the black state.  They can use their intense chauvanism to justify a nazi-style pogrom on blacks, but they&rsquo;re too weak and dumb to try it on an all white state.  The whitest states will steer clear of all others, guard their borders, and live for awhile as George Washington and the founders always intended. But in their midst, the marxists will be&hellip;waiting to destroy it all again.</p>

		<p>I remember in my younger days, there was much more <br>
solidarity amount whites, and the situation that we<br>
are facing today as the result of massive third world<br>
immigration, affirmative action would be impossible<br>
for whites to accept and promote as late as 1960.<br>
This is because of the constant brainwashing by the<br>
mass media, the churches, that have mostly abandoned<br>
all traditional christian percepts. The schools,<br>
and institutions of higher learning have all been<br>
taken over by change agents.<br>
Now, with the exception of forums like amren, it is<br>
mostly impossible to strike up a common sense<br>
conversation about race.<br>
With the exception of forums like this, I feel that<br>
the blinded majority are being lead to a certain disaster.</p>

		<p>Some whites have already started moving to areas where they can be with their own.  The Northwest group is one, and there are plenty of like-minded folks in Eastern TN and Western NC.  Back in the hills, where they can be left alone to form their groups.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s such a bad thing - people associate most comfortably and naturally with other people like themselves.</p>

		<p>I was having a conversation with some people about this today, (the nation being swamped by illiterate third worlders we have to support) and I was asked how we can protect ourselves and keep it away from our own lives.</p>
<p>I simply said, &#8220;Move to a rural town where there are no jobs and no official government run financial supports.  The first will keep the latinos out.  The second will keep the blacks out.&#8221;</p>
<p>An informal whites economy free of paperwork and official connections is the only way to survive and keep our community going.  Already, the &#8220;Whiteopias&#8221; are under the magnifying glass.  Those people need to bring their economy undeerground and offer no official government support services whatsoever.  Do everything through &#8216;faith-based&rsquo; organizations, and keep the immigrant loving evangelicals out of the loop. </p>

Generally, I have a feeling of hopelessness.   I often talk to the rising generations, those in their 20&rsquo;s especially.   A majority appear to have been &#8216;educated&rsquo; to be fully comfortable with the surrender of their culture and way of life.  They seem ready to accept any absurd result rather than be thought of as a &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I see no solution if sight for a society willing to eliminate itself for abstract ideals like multi-culturalism.  This would not be the first time the masses marched off the cliff for basically insane reasons.  </p>

		<p>A very good article.  Balkanization has been the goal of some Democrats and most Leftists for decades and now we are seeing the fruit growing on the vine in plain sight, and it is rotten, destined not for wine, but the trash heap.</p>
<p>Jay wrote: &ldquo;Move to a rural town where there are no jobs and no official government run financial supports. The first will keep the Latinos out. The second will keep the blacks out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trouble is that welfare is a state run thing, so what does it matter where someone lives as long as the state they are in provides the goodies? It wouldn&rsquo;t keep blacks or Latinos out. Blacks know the system and Latinos figure it out soon after arriving.  Just have some babies and live on the government dime. </p>
<p>One statement stood out for me in this article: &ldquo;Land, under any concept of possession, ends up in the hands of those who deserve it.&rdquo; We are increasingly, by our lack of exertion of group self-interest, losing what we have had for the relatively short period in history that we have had it. And losing it not to a superior military, intellectual or moral force, but to a bunch of illiterate, unarmed peasants; welcomed in by our fifth-column in congress, statehouses and universities everywhere.</p>

		<p>The break up of the United States into smaller, mutually hostile ethno-states is a very real possibility. What will result from that however is a much wider regional if not a world war. Even if that does not happen, hostile nations such as Mexico will take full advantage of the chaos to seize former American territory, or grind axes in any number of ways, including organized genocide against white Americans. One fact is certain, if a white ethno-state does emerge, it will be vulnerable to attack. That will require it to seek the backing of another country, just as the Founding Fathers sought and got the help of the French during the Revolutionary War. Without arms, money and troops from France, the British would have executed them as traitors and the America I was born in would never have existed. The Confederacy also sought and got foreign backers behind it. The only countries who might be of assistance to us would likely be Russia and Canada, the European nations and Australia are too small or over run with non-whites and Muslims. Even Russia and Canada have large numbers of hostile non-whites and Muslims in their midst. Make no mistake, they would not be helping out of the goodness of their hearts, but because would be in their self interest to do so. On it&rsquo;s own, a white ethno-state will sooner or later be attacked and it&rsquo;s people killed by overwhelming hordes of Mestizos or other non-whites who hate and envy us. The Chinese malediction, &#8220;May you live in interesting times.&#8221; certainly applies to us right now.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Move to a rural town where there are no jobs and no official government run financial supports. The first will keep the latinos out. The second will keep the blacks out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An informal white economy free of paperwork and official connections is the only way to survive and keep our community going. Already, the &ldquo;Whiteopias&rdquo; are under the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>&hellip;. Do everything through &lsquo;faith-based&rsquo; organizations, and keep the immigrant-loving evangelicals out of the loop. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Oh, absolutely!  It&rsquo;s essential to keep them out. (But   &mdash;   be warned   &mdash;    they won&rsquo;t be kept out easily.)</p>
<p>Very interesting suggestions. However, I fear that once  this started catching on, large scale, and the government, foundations, NGO&rsquo;s,  and churches realized what  you were doing, they would mount massive programs to break this up. They wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate it. They would find some way to penetrate and subvert you.  The government would seek to get you &#8220;hooked&#8221; on government aid in some form  (hurricane relief, flood help, or something   &mdash;   anything at all), and the goody-goody church organizations would start shipping in colonies of Papuans, Fiji islanders, etc. to &#8220;enrich&#8221; you with their diversity.</p>
<p>Corporations would flock there to open factories or offices - to take advantage of the white, educated population   &mdash;   but soon these new jobs would become a magnet for every third worlder on the planet  (who would HAVE TO BE hired, under watchful government mandate).</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you&rsquo;re going to have a Utopia, you&rsquo;re going to have to build an impregnable wall around it. But our present government - and all the meddlesome non-governmental organizations   &mdash;   will never, never allow that.</p>

<i>What then makes America American? Dr. Nelson cites the economist Robert J. Samuelson: &ldquo;Prosperity is what binds us together.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
And when the prosperity dries up, so will the phony camaraderie between ethnic groups   &mdash;   and the &#8220;Diversity is our strength&#8221; meme will be revealed as a lie to even the dimmest of caucasians. </p>
<p>As I (and others) have said on here in the past: the Third Worlders who come here don&rsquo;t do so because they love us, they only love our money. And when that&rsquo;s gone, look out! I&rsquo;d compare them to &#8220;fair-weather friends&#8221; only I don&rsquo;t consider them friends at all. It&rsquo;s like in the marriage vows, when bride and groom pledge to stay together &#8220;For better or for worse.&#8221; Immigrants are only here for the better, not the worse. When things get rough, they&rsquo;ll either scoot or turn on us (probably the latter). </p>
<p>In any event, thanks AmRen, for reprinting this excellent (if depressing) article. One thing that struck me was this line   &mdash;   because it reminded me of something I&rsquo;ve often wondered about Jared Taylor himself: </p>
<p><i>Awakened white consciousness may not come for several decades.</i></p>
<p>This article is from 1994. It&rsquo;s now 16 years later   &mdash;   and a full two decades since Mr. Taylor began AmRen   &mdash;   and yet any large-scale &#8220;awakened white consciousness&#8221; STILL seems several decades away. AmRen has surely increased in popularity and reach since 1990   &mdash;   but based on the number of daily commenters here, is still more of a &#8220;fringe&#8221; group than one with wide influence and reach. </p>
<p>So what I wonder is this: How does the real America of 2010 (complete with its Mulatto Messiah) compare to the 2010 America that Mr. Taylor would have predicted back in 1990? Or is it worse? This is a question I&rsquo;d very much like to see Jared address sometime during this, AR&rsquo;s 20th Anniversary year. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Awakened white consciousness may not come for several decades. Because America &mdash; with its forms, its trappings of government, its national symbols and slogans &mdash; derives almost exclusively from European sources, whites will be the last to abdjure the realm and abandon the current notion of what America is supposed to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is totally true. Whites will be the last group to adopt widespread ethnic consciousness because of nostalgia for America as it once was. I&rsquo;m afraid by then it will be too late. Our elites will never allow a separate all white Ethno-State without a fight, and I think the fight has been bred out of us.  Maybe, I&rsquo;m wrong but in any case, I won&rsquo;t see that day. I can still hope that others do. <br>
