			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South African authorities have handed the ownership documents of a Cape Town house belonging to Zimbabwe&rsquo;s government to some Zimbabwean farmers.</p>
<p>The white farmers want compensation for the seizure of their land.</p>
<p>The government has two months to come up with money for legal fees incurred by the farmers in their compensation claim case or the house will be sold.</p>
<p>Last week, a South African court agreed with a regional court ruling that the violent land grabs were unlawful.</p>
<p>The ruling paved the way for farmers who lost property to file for compensation in South African courts.</p>
<p>Almost all white-owned land in Zimbabwe has been seized in the past 10 years.</p>
<p><b>Jets vulnerable</b></p>
<p>A sheriff of the court served notices on the residents of one of four Zimbabwean government-owned properties in Cape Town said to be worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people occupying the house told us that they are leasing it from the Zimbabwe government,&#8221; the farmers&rsquo; lawyer Willie Spies told the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;This makes this a commercial property which is therefore not protected by diplomatic immunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the handing over of the ownership documents was a more of a symbolic gesture as the money from any auction would be used for legal fees.</p>
<p>But he said it showed it was possible to enforce legal principles against the Zimbabwean government in South Africa.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Mohammed Allie in Cape Town says other non-diplomatic assets such as Air Zimbabwe jets are also vulnerable to be seized for compensation for lost farms.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) court ruled that the group of more than 70 Zimbabwean farmers should be allowed to return to their farms unhindered.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a Zimbabwe court rejected the farmers&rsquo; attempt to enforce the Sadc tribunal&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four hundred and 28 South African farmers, who owned farms in Zimbabwe were also victims of the land reform, they too are exploring means of compensation,&#8221; Mr Spies said.</p>
<p>Despite the formation of a unity government in Zimbabwe a year ago, white farmers are still facing harassment.</p>
<p>Land reform is one of President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s central policies but his critics say it has helped destroy the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Under colonial rule, white farmers seized much of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s best land, forcing black farmers to less fertile areas.</p>
<p>Reversing this was one of the reasons for Zimbabweans taking up arms in the 1970s to end white minority rule.<br>

<p>Except it&rsquo;s not very good land to begin with, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t being &#8220;farmed&#8221; by blacks, at least not in the same productive manner as the white farms.  There were likely hardly any black people in what is now Zimbabwe at all before the whites came.  It is my understanding that even the best land in Zimbabwe is somewhat akin to, say, the flattest areas of New Mexico east of Albuquerque.  In other words, you need a lot of forward thinking and discipline in order to be able to farm it well.</p>

<p>I cannot say what the quality of the land was, but the Rhodesian farms were on a huge scale, and devoted to cash crops and producing crops for export and such. Provided a lot of jobs for those working the farms. Were run as a business and not as subsistence farms. Did provide income and a lot of food for the locals. All gone now. The current lands taken over lay now fallow, the farming of such large acreages being way beyond the capacity of those who got title and property! </p>

		<p>I hope they have the sense to sell that land and get out of Africa while they still can.</p>

		<p>Me again, he of the real name no pseudonyms.  We lived in South Africa for 24 years until we escaped in 1999.   Zimbabwe will be one of the many African Countries begging for aid as they &#8220;are struggling&#8221; very soon with all the productive farmers being evicted and the black workers who were very happy to have jobs, the normal services including schooling for their kids and hope for the future until Mugabe stole the farms for his cohorts in his efforts successfully to stay in power until he dies.  Ex-Zim white farmers have been offered land in Zambia, and Mozambique where the locals are unable to do much more that subsistence farming.   But eventually some racist black leader will cry out that the successful whites do not belong in Africa and kill them or evict them.</p>
<p>Much of the farmland as such is suitable for bush farming, that is one acre may support one cow.  In Zim though since the 1880s tha Europeans have converted the bush into rich farmland where maize (corn) tobacco and beef was produced in such quantities that Rhodesia (the old Zimbabwe) was rightly named the bread basket of Sub-Saharan Africa and much of this food was exported locally.  Now, Zimbabweans are starving except of course for Mugabe and his gangs, eating leaves &amp; berries off non-food trees, killing and eating the animals in the wild life parks, and water, once when the European Africans were in charge, even in drought times, was plentiful for survival, is in short supply.</p>
<p>Just like Haiti where massive amounts of aid have just been raised to rebuild the country, I question again and again, at risk of being openly called a racist here by some ignorant individuals who have never been to any countries except the UK and Spain, why is it that the black races cannot survive in the modern world without begging for aid?</p>
<p>The UK is like other Western countries who were duped into the financial crisis, any activists are openly demanding that aid to these countries should be minimal as &#8220;charity starts at home&#8221;.</p>
<p>We are all hoping that the general election expected in May will produce a new government that will echo theses cries.  The citizens are being taxed as never before to pay for the stupidity of the politicians (Labour mainly but also the other parties as well who did not speak out strongly against the toxic loans - except for Nick Griffin the leader of the BNP) but our children will be paying taxes for years to repay the loans to the banks.</p>
<p>I read that the US President Obama is receiving a lot of flack for his policies, now being seen to be against the ones that made the USA the richest (best) country in the World?   He appears to be introducing Socialism which for most of us is the beginning of the problems.  I do not know enough about the US scene to say more but hopefully. as an interested party, I will learn more.</p>
<p>As for the illegal immigrants from Mexico, etc.  Surely, there is no point in having laws if they are not enforced?  But Europe is having the same problems and I find that there are many well-.meaning &#8220;liberal people&#8221; (often they do not think thay are liberal) who feel sorry for these poor people but they do not realise the great dangers they and their children face if they are not strong now.  By all means send in colonisers to sort out these countries&rsquo; problems for them but do not allow them to bring their problems to the Western World.  </p>
<p>incidentally I saw the film &#8220;Slumdog Millionaire&#8221; last night and felt very angry as India was one of the biggest critics of Apartheid.  The black South Africans never lived as the poor Indians still do and the Indian Govt. of that day was very hypocritical to condemn Apartheid.</p>
<p>But we living in South Africa at that time knew this.  A very depressing movie.<br>

		<p>Well, the first thing one takes away from this bizarrely incoherent piece is that the BBC employs functional illiterates and perhaps moderately retarded personnel on its reportorial staff.</p>
<p>If I get this straight, there must be South African farmers who own land in Zimbabwe who lost it in Mugabe&rsquo;s farm confiscation program.  And SA is threatening to seize Zimbabwean-owned properties in SA, and possibly some Zimbabwean airliners, by way of retribution.  And somehow SADC has demanded that some seventy Zimbabwean (or is it South African) farmers should be allowed to return to their land in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Umm, oh, never mind.</p>

		<p>According to Paul Theroux&rsquo;s book DARK STAR SAFARI, the land is sandy and needs treatment with minerals before mechanized farming will be productive. And African Blacks will resort to subsistence farming small plots every time they take over land. </p>

		<p>This sounds good on paper, but in reality I&rsquo;m betting even {IF} they are awarded their property back, it would be more than foolhardy to attempt to physically occupy it, more than likely even fatal. Mugabe, or the blacks would see to that with full approval. The old saying, &#8220;believe nothing you see, and only half of what you hear, applies here. </p>
