<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/35049.html">Robert Menendez Poll Draws Scrutiny</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bresnahan, Politico, March 26, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) has begun an unofficial &#8220;diversity survey&#8221; of Fortune 500 companies and has told the companies that if they do not participate in the survey, he will make their names public.</p>
<p>The survey has already drawn fire from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as &#8220;a fishing expedition&#8221; and from legal experts, who say companies may violate federal employment laws by even asking such questions of their employees or suppliers.</p>
<p>Menendez, the only Hispanic in the Senate, wants to find out how many minorities, women and disabled people serve as top executives or members of the firms&rsquo; corporate boards, as well as the &#8220;demographic makeup of your suppliers.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a company responds to Menendez&rsquo;s request, its information will be kept anonymous, although it will be aggregated in a report Menendez plans to issue later this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Menendez said the survey had nothing to do with being chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, where one of his main roles is raising money and courting wealthy donors. And he rejected any suggestion that a company that did not comply with the survey could be the object of a boycott.</p>

		<p>Speaking of boycotts, any of these companies who end up caving in and groveling, will be boycotted by people like us. </p>
<p>If Sen. Robert Menendez feels so strongly about discrimination, why don&rsquo;t he do something about discrimination in places such as, well, how about Mexico itself.</p>
<p>Is it true that it is perfectly legal to ask female job applicants in Mexico to submit a recent photograph with their resumes? I also don&rsquo;t believe our <i>vecinos</i> down south aren&rsquo;t worried about their own lack of black managers.</p>

<p>Really?  Then what <i>is</i> the object of making their names public?  Did anyone ask him that one?</p>
<p>Just imagine a <i>White</i> legislator pulling this stunt to determine if there were enough White managers in American business.  The double standards are so common now that they&rsquo;ve become the norm.  And any White who notices is, of course, a Racist.<br>

		<p>The self-serving agenda of these people is never-ending. I was recently at a conference and the only non-white person in the room was a latino. I could have guessed before he even opened his mouth that he was there to gain something to benefit the &#8216;latino community&rsquo;. I wanted to ask him what he plans to do to benefit the American community. I work in higher education and every Latino at the university is involved in some scheme to benefit their own in one way or another.  </p>

		<p>Why is he concerned about the US as a whole? Shouldn&rsquo;t he be concerned about what&rsquo;s going on in New Jersey? How many fortune 500 companies are headquartered there? </p>
<p>Before becoming a US Senator Mr Menendez represented New Jersey&rsquo;s 13th congressional district, that happens to be 50% Hispanic. Might it be possible, that in Mr. Menendez&rsquo;s own home district, Whites, Asians and blacks, make up less than 70%, 5% and 14%, respectfully, of managers? That right under Mr. Menendez&rsquo;s own very nose, this is where there is inequality?</p>
<p>If there is a shameful preponderance of one racial group in his home district, in this case, Hispanics, does that mean in other regions, the racial-balance is equalized by there being a lessor number of Hispanics?</p>
<p>How about we examine Union city New Jersey (80% Hispanic), where Mr. Menendez was mayor before going on to congress? Wouldn&rsquo;t this be a more appropriate place for Mr. Menendez to examine, a lack, or preponderance, of one race over another? There&rsquo;s a place he can also examine the &#8216;demographic make-up of suppliers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t Mr. Menendez be concerned about his own district? Are these important figures or not? Isn&rsquo;t this an important piece of the mosaic, Mr. Menendez&rsquo;s own district? Is this an important issue or isn&rsquo;t it?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Senate&rsquo;s only Hispanic wants to know how many non-whites are in management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here it is again.  A blatant admission that he hates whites and can&rsquo;t stand to see them dominate in their own country.  It infuriates him.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is the same Hispanic who wants to open the border to unchecked illegal immigration. (But only if the invaders are all Hispanic.)</p>
<p>He also wants to write the amnesty bill that only allows for Hispanics to be considered, even though there are about 4 million immigrants from other non-latin countries, 50,000 of which are from Ireland.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism imports hatred from other countries, and it carries on from generation to generation.</p>

		<p>Menendez is under the shadow of a recall vote by the TEA in New Jersey.  He is a do nothing Senator who only cares about his illegal alien Hispanics.  He is carrying out a Witch Hunt.  He did not visit or do anything to help the tens of thousands of families who were flood out in the big storms recently.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s none of Menendez&rsquo; BUSINESS how many nonwhites are heads of businesses.  CEO&rsquo;s get their positions because of ability, not skin color.  Menendez should be asking how many QUALIFIED graduates of business schools are not white males.  He might find out that it&rsquo;s precious few, because minorities didn&rsquo;t bother to get the education to qualify in the first place.</p>

		<p>Hey, Menendez.  Have you heard of something called freedom of assocation?  Oh, wait!  Never mind.  That doesn&rsquo;t apply to whites.  Forget I said anything.  Continue on with your extortion of &#8216;racist whites&rsquo; and let non-whites take these jobs and drive the companies and their stock into the ground.</p>

<p>Nobody deserves to tell a business who they have to hire, who they have to promote, nor give reasons why they didn&rsquo;t hire someone.  As well, blacks have chose to be here as much as any other group.  They&rsquo;ve had since 1865 to leave.</p>

		<p>So Senator Menendez wants to find out amoung other things how many &#8220;minorities&#8221; are employed by Fortune 500 companies. And of course all you need to qualify as a &#8220;minority&#8221; is a Spanish surname like the one Señor Menendez has.  You see he is not an Amerindian or black of a Spanish speaking background, instead he is a white Cuban. I wonder, since I speak some Spanish could I change my name to say &#8220;Romero&#8221; or &#8220;Hernandez&#8221; and qualify as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; like Sen. Menendez and thus join him in the lucrtaive race-hussling business? </p>

<p>Well, blacks have been free to emigrate for about 150 years.  No one is forcing anyone to stay around.  They have remained because they have been led to believe that they were going to get special privileges for staying.  Christian groups like Quakers set up their all-black colleges and a white Christian woman founded the NAACP for the benefit of blacks in America.  Later, thanks to the likes of MLK and LBJ, the government became involved in supporting exclusive black privilege.  Later this was parlayed to include anyone not white.  But as a result of about 150 years of expectation and political manipulation with its push and shove, Blacks live in a culture of expectation of special bprivilege because they&rsquo;re black.  Whenever I hear the phrase &#8220;white skin privilege&#8221; I want to scream.</p>
<p>The reason I include the descriptor of &#8220;Christian&#8221; is because they were adamant that the Christian who set up these institutions saw it as part of their overall work as Christians.  In fact they were downright fanatical about it, especially in the antebellum period.  John Brown and his ilk were radical Christians who wanted to see a real time version of Armageddon in America, but there were many of them.  They got &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221; on our currency pushed through Congress in 1863 in the middle of a civil war, even though Jesus supposedly condemned &#8220;mannon.&#8221;  Now we have more Christians attempting to &#8220;force the end&#8221; by forming a militia and plotting insurrection thinking that the Bible mandates it somehow.  And it does, but practicing those interpretations has always led to conflict and harm.  This is what I mean when I write that whites are often their own worst ememy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t anyone tell me that this is irrelevant.</p>

<p>This &#8220;poll&#8221; is an obvious shakedown operation.</p>
<p>Companies which don&rsquo;t cough up with donations face the implied threat of law suits and being smeared publicly because they don&rsquo;t have enough minorities in management positions. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. Most corporations will probably pay Menendez off just to get him to go away. This kind of thing goes on all the time. It&rsquo;s business as usual in our multicultural paradise.</p>
