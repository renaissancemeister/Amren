			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Fogarty, Queens Chronicle, March 4, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Feb. 8, Phyllis, a 45-year-old white Howard Beach resident who has requested her last name be omitted for this article, left her place of employment on Crossbay Boulevard at around 3:15 p.m. to cross the street and purchase a pack of Marlboro&rsquo;s and a can of soda from C-Town grocery store, located at the corner of Sutter Avenue and Crossbay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Having completed her purchases, she prepared to cut across Crossbay and return to work, not expecting to encounter trouble from a group of about 12 teens  &mdash;  which included the boy and girl with whom she had exchanged words in front of C-Town  &mdash;  that had congregated on the corner across the boulevard from Cookie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I was walking by, the boy told the girl &#8216;oh look, here comes that b**** again, she&rsquo;s gonna f*** with you,&rsquo;&#8221; Phyllis said. &#8220;The girl then approached me and said, &#8216;I know you didn&rsquo;t cross the street to f*** with me, you white b****.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyllis said she repeated to the girl that she should be more respectful and the girl, in turn, slapped Phyllis&rsquo; hand. Almost immediately, four of the teens jumped on the woman, kicking and beating her. They stole her cell phone and left her on the ground, fleeing when the police showed up.</p>
<p>When the nightmare was over, Phyllis learned two bones in her spine had been fractured and one of her ribs had been kicked out of alignment, which affected her lungs and breathing. Countless doctor and chiropractor appointments later, and she says her back is still killing her.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;I&rsquo;ve been around the block a few times, grew up in Brooklyn and have a little street in me,&#8221; she said.&#8221; But this has really devastated me. They attacked me because of the color of my skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to police, a 15-year-old black male from Queens was arrested in connection with the assault. The girl is still unapprehended. The boy, whose identity remains anonymous because he is a minor, has been charged with robbery and assault and Phyllis says she and police are pushing to make sure he is charged with a racial hate crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the 9,160 single-bias hate crime offenses reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2008, more than half stemmed from racial bias, but only 17.3 percent of those reflected &#8220;anti-white&#8221; bias.</p>
<p>Despite this statistic, Phyllis said her friends, family and even her doctors support her decision to press hate crime charges. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I have good medical insurance and I&rsquo;m not suing because I need that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to be 46 years old in June. I grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood, and I never experienced anything like this. I find this to be one of the most disturbing things to happen to me in my life  &mdash;  but if I can help someone by telling my story, then maybe it&rsquo;s worth it.&#8221;<br>

<p>Despite?  As if anti-white bias in hate crimes is some sort of rarity?  It would be way higher than 17.3% if authorities looked for anti-white bias as enthusiastically as they looked for anti-nonwhite bias.</p>

<p>It would be a lot higher but we know the police and prosecutors often will not bring hate crime charges if the victim is white.</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder admits that &#8216;certain groups&rsquo; i.e., whites are not covered under the the new hate crime legislation he advocates.</p>

		<p>Queens, New York, one of the five boroughs of New York City is the fastest demographically changing county in the United States, as a matter of fact, in the world, except in time of war or invasion.  Whites are very rapidly becoming a minority here, no I&rsquo;m sorry, they are now a minority here.  Blacks are getting more and more frustrated because the Orientals (Chinese, Koreans, etc.) Indians and others are moving into their neighborhoods and starting to push THEM out.  The other groups mentioned are far more willing to work.  The Blacks, not always willing to attack non-Blacks who are not White, prefer instead as most probably realize, to attack Whites.  More and more of these attacks are taking place.  It is not reassuring that she decided to file hate crimes charges.  Where is it going to go and what good is it going to do?  Whites are afraid not only to talk but also to fight.  Years ago in Howard Beach this would not have been tolerated.  Howard Beach used to be almost all Italian.  This is no longer true.  Since Howard Beach got a bad reputation in the late 1980&rsquo;s with the death of a Black (that was causing or about to cause trouble) being chased by a group of Whites, the residents, not surprisingly are scared to death of appearing racist, very much like many Whites today.  I fear that there is going to be many, many, more incidents of this nature and probably a lot worse before Whites begin to take full possession of their faculties again and begin to re-group.  </p>

		<p>I grew up in Queens and I&rsquo;m slightly older than Phyllis.  Is she kidding?  I am not surprised one bit and I don&rsquo;t know anyone from Queens who would be.  She is lucky she escaped with her life or at a minimum far more damage.</p>
<p>Howard Beach used to be mostly Italian and the blacks would not dare cross the Italians.  I guess the Italians have also been neutered along with the rest of us.<br>

		<p>You know, blacks are something like 16 times more likely to commit racial murder, 34 times more likely to assault, 100 times more likely to rob, and over 600 times more likely to commit rape against a white than the reverse (and 2 1/2 times more likely to be convicted of an officially designated hate crime), so, the media always portraying hate as something white means there are distorting the true facts perhaps by as much as 1,000 times. </p>
<p>I was getting ready to make my comment. . something about. . it seems in many of these cases authority figures pressure the white victim into not pressing charges, because everyone knows people of color are the real victims, when I notice even the reporter gets in on the act&hellip; &#8220;Phyllis says she and police are pushing to make sure he is charged with a racial hate crime&hellip; Of the 9,160 single-bias hate crime offenses reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2008, more than half stemmed from racial bias, but only 17.3 percent of those reflected &ldquo;anti-white&rdquo; bias. Despite this statistic&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s always trying to be &#8216;sensitive&rsquo;, for a variety of reasons, I wonder if people were afraid of being insensitive to whites, if this reporter might be accused of &#8216;hatred&rsquo; here (making light of this white ladies plight and not trying to prosecute the case to the most outrageous level possible (anything less is sliding towards hate).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sick of the &#8216;hatred&rsquo; label, but I wonder if the media reported the more fairly facts, or if the races were reversed, as they say, if this reporter would be accused of &#8216;hate&rsquo;? And if she&rsquo;d be writing in this manner in the first place.</p>

<p><br>
First we ALL know why the stats ONLY show 17% of &#8220;hatecrimes&#8221; are perpetrated against Whites, but that the actual number is much higher. How many times do blacks (and others) attack Whites and the cops/prosecutors bend over backwards to deny there was any racial bias involved? But what does &#8220;Despite this statistic, Phyllis said her friends, family and even her doctors support her decision to press hate crime charges&#8221;, mean??? Why would the stats have any bearing on whether this woman sought hatecrimes charges against these thugs? A hatecrime is a hatecrime. </p>
<p>Though I am totally against the hatecrimes laws, blacks and other minorities need to be charged with them whenever they apply. A White is charged with a hatecrime at the drop of a hat. Minorities should be as well. If they were, it wouldnt be long before jesse, al and all the others who play race games would demand an end to hatecrimes laws. This is one instance where I would agree with them. </p>
<p><br>
As far as there only being ONLY 9160 hatecrimes offenses commited in all of 2008, with roughly 50% of them being racially motivated?? Yeah, right!!! I would bet there are more than 9160 black on White hatecrimes in any given month. If those in charge did their jobs without protecting minorities from being charged with these crimes, the stats would reflect this. <br>

		<p>I moved to Queens from the idyllic white bread midwest.  I have seen things here that defy belief!  And I&rsquo;m not talking about the skyline.  Blacks walk in big packs and have an almost uncanny sense of whom to attack and when.  I have seen a real bonafide &#8220;beat down&#8221; where a huge pack of blacks (and afrolatinos) set upon one of their own - for no reason.  I also saw a riot in a high school where two groups of blacks and latinos were going after each other to the tune of at least 30+ participants.  The guards had a doozy of a time quelling it.</p>
<p>As poster #3 notes, there&rsquo;s tons of Asians of all types moving in queens.  My neighborhood is at least 60% Asian now. The rest are old jews and misc. whites who are all dying off.  I cannot remember the last time, outside of one incident a year ago, that I&rsquo;ve seen any white babies, anywhere on any street, in any type of location.  (The Latino women you see in the rough areas of queens are 50% of the time pushing a baby cart.)</p>
<p>I know America is changing and all and our civilization is slated for obscurity, but while I don&rsquo;t mind living around Asians, I do know that blacks are almost all DANGEROUS and I will not live in fear in my own home. </p>

		<p> What&rsquo;s surprising is not that the nasty incident occurred, but that a (community) newspaper actually published a story about it. If the races had been reversed the New York Times and the rest of the mainstream media would be screaming the details and bemoaning the &#8220;White racism&#8221; involved.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s typical that some time after the incident occurred, the district attorney apparently still hasn&rsquo;t filed &#8220;hate crime&#8221; charges against the 15-year-old. And why have the police not found the girlfriend, and the other young black thugs who committed this unprovoked assault?</p>

<p>You mean this woman is 45yrs old and just NOW gets it. Obviously this woman should have gone around the block a few more times and got more steet in her. Sadly, a large % of Whites are of this mindset and someting like this has to personally happen to them to wake up. Even sadder is that some Whites don&rsquo;t wake up even AFTER something like this happens to them. This group will have to be thrown to the wolves if we&rsquo;re ever going to make it as a race. I have some in my family that have REPEATEDLY been victimized [ verbally and physically ] by blacks, and they&rsquo;re still pro diversity pro intergration. They refuse to listen to reason and common sense. They&rsquo;re beyond help!!  </p>

		<p>I grew up in Queens. Whites have lost the right to defend themselves. It was in Howard Beach in mid 80s when a group of white teenagers after being threatened with a knife, beat up 5 blacks . One black was high on crack and stupidly attempted to walk across a busy highway and was accidentally killed. The spineless worthless, white politicians blamed the white teenagers, who were several blocks away. The mayor at the time the worthless Ed Koch called this accident &#8220;The worse murder in the history of New York&#8221;. Several years ago, whites again in the Howard Beach area were again painted as terrible criminals because they again attempted to protect themselves. Of course, the crack addict getting killed in a traffic accident was the opening story on all the MSM networks. The well-known fraud Dan Rather actually introduced the story with &#8221; Tonight, we begin with a modern day lynching&#8221;.  On the same day the crack addict was killed, an orthodox Jew was the victim of a real homicide. It wasn&rsquo;t covered in the newspapers or on TV. The police never caught the murderers. There was no effort to find the killers.</p>

<p>Good point.  I live in NYC (not Queens) and I hadn&rsquo;t known about this. Nor have I ever heard of the Queens Chronicle.  It&rsquo;s significant that it&rsquo;s printed in what is apparently a small community newspaper, but not in any of the major NY daily papers   &mdash;   the &#8220;MSM&#8221;, as we say.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Phyllis can be the one who sets the PRECEDENT for black-on-white racism.  With the country moving towards a more conservative stance generally, this is definitely within the realm of possibility.  I hope she does - it&rsquo;s high time the socalled authorities cut out this nonsense that blacks can&rsquo;t be racist - you don&rsquo;t have to go much farther than Jeremiah Wright or Louis Farrakhan to see clear examples of it.</p>

		<p>This goes back to what I wrote on the <i>Obama&rsquo;s Top Civil Rights Prosecutor Misrepresents Hate Crimes Statistics</i> thread.   The FBI report is totally bogus, it&rsquo;s a racist propaganda fraud made up out of whole cloth, a hate crime itself.   Less than 1600 hate-crimes against whites for the whole country for the whole year.  I&rsquo;ll guarantee there were more than 1600 hate crimes against whites in New York City alone that year and there would have been more had not millions of whites been already ethnically cleansed from the place,  in large part because of the lies the media and government tell in sponsoring racist violence against them.  </p>
<p><i>only 17.3 percent of those reflected &ldquo;anti-white&rdquo; bias.<br>
Despite this statistic</i></p>
<p>It also is a good example of another point I made in the <i>Obama&rsquo;s Top Civil Rights Prosecutors</i> thread - the FBI report provides cover for the media and government to support racist assaults against whites, including murder and rape.  ONLY 17.3 and DESPITE - I mean, how dare this woman complain!   (And what&rsquo;s with putting &#8220;anti-white&#8221; in parenthesis?) If the FBI says it&rsquo;s only 17.3 percent,  it&rsquo;s hardly worth mentioning, is it?  Why, whites get off so easily when it comes to racist violence they have no right to complain.  Serves them right, in fact, since the FBI report PROVES that they are the chief perpetrators of racist violence and hardly ever the victims &hellip;</p>
<p>One interesting thing about the FBI report is the number 9160.   Less than 10,000 hate crimes in a country of over 300 million (and many of those crimes things like graffiti, or name-calling, or scattering cotton balls).   The Justice Department has a dilemma - they have to produce a report that shows white folks gone wild because their political masters derive most of their power from the &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; campaign,  yet they also have to avoid calling into question the workability of multi-racialism and multi-culturalism.   The real figure for bias crimes is probably in the hundreds of thousands yearly, with whites making up the vast majority of victims, and that&rsquo;s only OVERT acts of violence it doesn&rsquo;t count, for example, things like people not walking or living in certain areas due to the very real threat of racial assault.   If they told the truth about racial violence in America it might lead people, especially whites, to question the value and workability of multi-racialism and multi-culturalism.  So they pull this &#8220;just right&#8221; bit of porridge out from under the table - only 9160 and those evil whites to blame.  </p>

		<p>The problem with a percentage of whites is that when we point out black bigotry, they will get reactive and say, &#8216;oh no, you racist (bleep)!  Not all blacks do this to whites.&rsquo;  These whites are so self-righteous and so scared of being called a racist that they won&rsquo;t even consider the possibility that this is the mentality of most blacks.</p>

		<p>Hopefully, as TV has to compete more and more with the net, news of black-on-white crime will become more well known.  Occasionally, even now, the MSM will cover some heinous event.  Even without comment on racial angles, viewers can perceive what happened.  And investigative programs are also growing in number, and, although they used to mostly ignore black crime, the reluctance to showcase it seems to be disappearing.</p>

		<p>I live in Queens in a mostly oriental neighborhood and I chose this because of what I often say to my frineds, &#8220;When&rsquo;s the last time you heard of an oriental mugger?&#8221; While there are areas of Queens with blacks, most of the busses and subway system have a lower percentage of them than the other boroughs (except for Staten Island).</p>
<p>At the same time, when there is a group of black young people nearby it&rsquo;s time to either cross the street or change subway cars since you never know when there could be trouble.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is that most Americans get their ideas of race relations from television and movies, and based on that all seems like a &#8220;hunky dory&#8221; world. When the wake up call comes, it can be too late, as was the case for the young couple in Knoxville who had to live through horrible torture until eventually being killed by black criminals. </p>
<p>Again, I think that as the percentage of whites in the overall population continues to decrease, and we become more conscious of being a &#8220;dispossessed majority&#8221; as Wilmot Robertson put it in his book, that racial consciousness will have to rise as a matter of course and there won&rsquo;t be anything the Establishment propaganda machine can do to stop this from happening. Increasing number of episodes like the attack on the woman in Queens will only hasten such an awakening.</p>

___________</p>
<p>Well, that is because there is a &#8220;bias&#8221; in these stats to give the impression that only whites are capable of &#8220;hate&#8221;. How many black on white crimes are reported as just mere &#8220;robberies&#8221; even though race was a clear factor (racial taunts like this case) in choosing a victim? Just the fact the words &#8220;anti-white&#8221; are used instead of &#8220;racist&#8221; shows the little word games that are being played out. Only whites are capable of being &#8220;racist&#8221;, whereas blacks or other minorities are just &#8220;anti-white&#8221;.</p>

		<p>So what are the odds that Al Sharpton, who is from N.Y. will go to bat for this white lady who was beaten. If any of you here are from the N.Y. area, keep us informed. And also will the mayor and Governor condemn this crime of racial hate?</p>

		<p>It seems to me that black females are no better than black males as far as being hateful and causing trouble. They just land in jail less often for it, mostly starting the altercations then egging on the males.</p>
<p>The Epic Beard Man video is just one example of thousands.</p>

<p>For blacks, as far as they&rsquo;re concerned, it&rsquo;s Open Season on Whites.  They&rsquo;re only doing what the hostile elite allow them to do.  A generation ago, these punks would have been sent a very strong message that if they choose to attack innocent Whites, they do so at their own peril and risk of losing life and limb. </p>
<p>Hispanics too are getting in on the vile act of attacking Whites.</p>
<p>The following took place in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Shenandoah Valley where (according to VDare): &#8220;Stonewall Jackson  made his name driving back Northern invaders during the Civil War. But now, thanks to federal immigration policy, it has serious Hispanic gang problems, dating from the early 2000s.&#8221;</p>
<p>A place no hispanic belongs, but is becoming overrun with gang graffiti and criminal gang activity:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Malave and three Hispanic men allegedly beat several white patrons inside M&T; Bar, 200 S. Main St.</p>
<p>Malave also allegedly yelled, &#8216;All the whites will die tonight,&rsquo; during the assault, and hit bartender Melissa Elrod with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>No charges have been filed against the three men involved in the fight, and they are not named in court documents.</p>
<p>Malave and three Hispanic men tried to assault three people with baseball bats on Aug. 7, 2006, according to court records. Malave and the men instead began smashing the victims&rsquo; cars with the bats before police arrived, according to the affidavit of probable cause.</p>
<p>Authorities initially charged Malave with ethnic intimidation in that case, but those charges were later dropped, according to records. Charges of criminal mischief, recklessly endangering another person and conspiracy were also dropped&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>So the authorities believe Hate Crimes or Ethnic Intimidation charges are not warranted even though Malave shouted &#8220;All Whites will Die Tonight!&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope you folks in Pennsylvania have CCW laws because it is clear your &#8216;authorities&rsquo;, along with the Justice Department, the FBI, the obama administration and every other government entity believe your life, because you are White, is not worth protecting and that you are expendable.</p>
<p>I asked for a new Glock 26 for my up-coming birthday and will put my faith in that to protect me, my children, my elderly relatives, my animals and other loved ones.  </p>
<p>Bon<br>

		<p>#3 FightBack&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;Whites are afraid not only to talk but also to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its because the restraints have been taken off of the blacks while they have been applied to the Whites, for various reasons, which one is a fear of a White-Rise in this Nation. They know exactly what happens when the Whites, the True Whites that Love their People have had enough and exactly what We will do.  But have no fear, My Brethren, its coming back, the Pride.</p>
<p>Even though the restraints have been applied to Us the younger generation of Warriors are approaching.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Its the &#8216;Masculinity&rsquo; of the White Race that offends. It doesnt offend in a literal sense&hellip;its &#8216;Scares&rsquo; the Hell out of them would be more accurate.</p>
<p>But its coming back, at least to a place close to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/carroll-dad-discovers-school-fight-club-030510" rel="nofollow">https://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/carroll-dad-discovers-school-fight-club-030510</a></p>
<p>Click on that and you will see Young White Men involved in a fight club of their own in between classes. NO ANGER, before, during or after. These Young Men, of whom I&rsquo;m very proud, is learning how to fight in a self controlled environment, absent the adults that would never approve of such &#8216;barbaric actions&rsquo;, such &#8216;brutal extremes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No matter what the school officials or the parents attempt to do to curb this behavior, its always in all of us, the ones with Dignity.</p>
<p>As others are mad, I am Proud of the little angels. And its happening everywhere I look down here.</p>

<p>Disgusting. But hardly anything new. These things have been going on for a long time now, &#8220;cleansing&#8221; our cities of whites as the new invaders sweep us before them and take possession of what was once ours.  Step by step, urban whites have systematically been <b>stripped of all legal means of defending themselves</b> and are left defenseless before the colored hordes; their sole recourse is to flee the urban terror&hellip; and they do.</p>
<p>Here in New York City, when Washington Heights was once white, middle class (and heavily Irish), my cousin&rsquo;s brother-in-law was in an Irish bar when a Hispanic came in and started shooting at random. The bother-in-law, a very young man,  was killed and the perp. fled.  So far as I know the crime has never been solved. That was 40 years ago   &mdash;   the late 60s. That&rsquo;s how long this reign of terror has been going on!  It&rsquo;s a racial war against us, make no mistake, but no authorities say so publicly.</p>
<p>As I said, that was when Washington Heights was still white. Virtually all the whites have long since fled, leaving the area now almost totally in the hands of Hispanics. To walk down the street today, you would think you were  somewhere in the Caribbean. They (the non-whites) have won, because whites were stripped of the right of self-defense. But the important point to note is that these mulatto Hispanics did not accomplish this victory <i>on their own. </i>  They could never have done that. It was done FOR THEM by the white leftist types who control the courts, the law, the criminal justice system, the social workers, the academicians. It was not Hispanics who passed anti-gun laws and imposed them on the law-abiding rest of us (while the criminals still remain armed). It was not Hispanics who rigged the justice system against native-born whites. It was the usual suspects who did this in their campaign to de-whiten America and make it more amenable, more agreeable to them.</p>
<p>Oh, incidentally, the suburban areas that the white refugees fled to are now being invaded by the next generation of the very same people who drove them out of Washington Heights 20-30-40 years ago.  It never stops! Wherever whites go, they are pursued within a generation.  Now, whites are fleeing from the darkening suburbs to the exurbs, and even to other states and other parts of the country. Where will it end?</p>

		<p>From my place on the inside, here&rsquo;s how the &#8220;investigation&#8221; goes down:</p>
<p>Yes, an assault occurred. However, the victim&rsquo;s claims of an anti-white racial angle will be met with frowns, smirks, and sideways glances amongst the patrolmen and detectives. </p>
<p>The most superficial attention will be given, and as always, law enforcement will look for astronomically impossible indicators of a &#8220;racial&#8221; angle on the part of the black attackers. </p>
<p>Did they scream &#8220;Die whitey&#8221;? Did they leave a written note? Did they scrawl anti-white slogans into the victim&rsquo;s skin? How can you be sure they were black? On and on, one ridiculous impossible-to-satisfy criterium after another. </p>
<p>There have even been times when police will turn common statistics against the victim: &#8220;Well gee sir, you stopped in a ghetto to ask for directions. Of course the blacks are going to attack and rob you.&#8221; From this the victim then sees him-/herself as the actual reason for the attack and lets the rest of it drop. </p>

<p>Thanks be to whom?  Remember, to hate the person because of their race is wrong, to be informed and suspicious in thinking of that race of individuals is merely &#8220;survival instinct.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Shenandoah Valley is in Virginia (my home state) and Stonewall Jackson operated throughout that state during the War of Northern Agression, not Pa. Also, #21, you are expecting quite a lot from a small gun (Glock 26). My advice is to get a good pump action or semi-auto  12 guage, something like a remington 870, with an extended magazine and a mix of slug and 00 buckshot. a nice laser sight is good to have too. then practice!!</p>

<p>Yes, it is well documented on the Internet, not widely reported in the msm, enemy of Whites:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Equal rights for all? That&rsquo;s not what Holder said in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee this spring. He asserted that the hate bill does not protect Christian ministers, whites, heterosexuals, policemen and members of U.S. military. Only favored groups, he said, such as homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims, and women will benefit under this new law&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course you&rsquo;re correct, sorry for the mix-up.</p>
<p>Shenandoah Valley is in Virginia, but there is also a Shenandoah PA.  DH is from that area.</p>
<p>Both are experiencing horrible problems with hispanic immigration.  Here is the story from Shenandoah Valley, Va:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;About a year ago, a student at James Madison University was leaving the 7-Eleven on South Main Street in Harrisonburg, Va., to return to his apartment. It was 2 a.m., hardly an unusual time for a kid in the college town to walk the streets near campus.</p>
<p>Yet walking about the city that late is just as unsafe as it common. Three members of the Mexican SUR 13 gang attacked him, the city&rsquo;s daily newspaper reported, and beat him unconscious. They took $1 and a cell phone.</p>
<p>After the crime, a friend of the victim texted the cell phone, the newspaper reported, only to receive a scatological, threatening text in return &mdash; the printable part said &#8216;South Side Sureneos run these 540 streets&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you know, 540 is the area code for the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/y8nl77w</p>
<p>The story related above is from Shenandoah PA.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;My advice is to get a good pump action or semi-auto 12 guage&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I already own two, loaded with #4 buckshot.  Not easy to carry in my purse, which is why I&rsquo;m asking for a Glock 26.</p>
<p>As Richard Maybury writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;The only purpose of a handgun is to keep you alive until you can get to your shotgun!&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very good shot, BTW.</p>
<p>Take care and thanks for keeping me on my toes.</p>
