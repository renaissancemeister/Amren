<h1>Mexican Police Ask Spirits to Guard Them in Drug War</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lizbeth Diaz, Reuters, March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police running scared from drug gangs in one of Mexico&rsquo;s deadliest cities are using bizarre rituals involving animal sacrifice and spirit tattoos to seek protection from raging violence on the U.S. border.</p>
<p>In secret meetings that draw on elements of Haitian Voodoo, Cuban Santeria and Mexican witchcraft, priests are slaughtering chickens on full moon nights on beaches, smearing police with the blood and using prayers to evoke spirits to guard them as drug cartels battle over smuggling routes into California.</p>
<p>Other police in the city of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, tattoo their bodies with Voodoo symbols, believing they can repel bullets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Army raids on homes of police working for cartels have found ornately adorned Santeria-type altars covered with statues and skulls stuffed with money paying homage to gods and spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know that guns and body armour are useless against the cartels because they are well-armed and can attack any time. But this is something we can believe in, that really works,&#8221; said a Tijuana-based policeman called Daniel.</p>
<p>BLACK MAGIC</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Small groups of police in the city started turning to strange rituals about 18 months ago, a practice spotted when municipal cleaners found a trail of dead chickens on beaches.</p>
<p>Priests and police say the animal sacrifices release life to rejuvenate spirits that will shield officers against hitmen. They believe the effects are intensified on full moon nights.</p>
<p>Many police see a need to shield themselves from witchcraft used by drug gangs who mix Caribbean black magic and occultism from southern Mexico using things like human bones, dead bats and snake fangs to curse enemies and unleash evil spirits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rituals are carried out by sometimes shadowy Mexicans who have menial day jobs and are priests by night. They claim to be trained in Voodoo, Santeria and other religions from time spent in the Caribbean and in Mexican towns like Catemaco, a centre for witchcraft on the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Police have the quiet support of their superiors.</p>

		<p>I say if it works, use it.  I feel sorry for the chickens, but maybe they barbecue &#8216;em afterwards.  But I don&rsquo;t have any problem with any rituals at all; if they&rsquo;re effective, go for it.</p>

		<p>I had a neighbor break in my vw van by tearing out a window in the camper door. He left a white powder spread all over the inside, neighbor children saw him do it. <br>
I called the police but they would not come out. I lived in Miami. My landladies daughter called the police and reamed them out. They still would not comeout until she thrreatened to call the TV station. When the cop came he was very bored and dismissive until I mentioned the white powder. Then he became excited and investigated. It turned out the powder was baby similar to baby powder mixed with God knows what to give the thief good luck. <br>
The neighbor thief could not be arrested as the cop did not want to press charges based on the kids eyewitness. The neighbor told everyone he was Cuban but he was really Peurto Rican. I fantasized what i was going to do to him until a weelk later I saw something lying under a tree in the courtyard and saw it was him sleeping, his little 4 foot wife got angry at him and made him sleep outside under the tree. I figured i didn&rsquo;t need to do anything to him.<br>
A few blocks away a canal got filled with dead voodoo chickesn and a railroad track that crossed the street was always littered with sacrifices warpped in ribbons.<br>
Welcome to multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>Well Geez Louise.  NO wonder the mexican police are ineffective and corrupt.  Hey Napolitano!  Forget those xray machines!  Just kill a chicken once a day!  What a cost savings!  I&rsquo;ll fee SO much safer flying.  Who wouldn&rsquo;t????</p>

		<p>The mexican would do better if they practiced their marksmanship. I now understand why the gangs are winning.</p>

		<p>Those Mexican police &#8220;officials&#8221; might also want to consult with native African peoples in Kenya and other areas. Human body parts are a highly effective magic charm against bullets. Isn&rsquo;t that what took place in Matamoras some 20 years or so ago? When college kids on spring break were murdered by Mexican gangstas and their blood or body parts were cooked and consumed. To &#8220;protect&#8221; them against police bullets.</p>
<p>One boy was from Santa Fe, Texas, as I recall.</p>

		<p>Open your minds you racist fools!  This is why diversity is a strength.  I can&rsquo;t wait to hang some snake fangs around my neck and smear rooster blood on my chest.  I just feel ashamed that I haven&rsquo;t embraced these beautiful cultures earlier.  I think I&rsquo;ll just abandon all of the values I learned from my ignorant German-American parents.  There was no diversity there, only ignorance and racism.  Finally something to help me shed a little of my white guilt.  Time to go see my Cuban Santeria preacher.  Adios.  </p>

		<p>If I as a soldier had to go into battle against Mexican drug fiends, I&rsquo;d put my trust in powder, tungsten and Kevlar, not to mention a good silenced automatic weapon with a starlight scope. These soldiers are the few Mexicans I have any respect for, because it takes balls to do what they&rsquo;re doing against these narco-terrorists which threaten the lives and freedom of Americans as well as Mexicans.</p>
