			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Martin, Daily Mail (London), March 30, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is a little on the damp side and popular with several species of spider.</p>
<p>But the obvious discomforts of Tilly Newman&rsquo;s garden shed were of little concern to a Romanian immigrant who decided to call it home.</p>
<p>While the Newman family were at work, he would make picnics in the garden and chat over the fence to the neighbours, who thought he was a legitimate lodger.</p>
<p>After each meal he thoughtfully put his rubbish into the correct recycling boxes.</p>
<p>And at night he used the garden hose to wash himself before bedding down on one of the sun loungers in the shed, using a sheet to protect the fabric.</p>
<p>Miss Newman, 22, an accountant, became suspicious when gifts  &mdash;  including a 6in Jesus statue  &mdash;  started appearing on the patio of the family home in Bromley, South-East London.</p>
<p>However, it was only when she went to spring clean her 10ft by 12ft shed that she came across the Romanian.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;He was lying there quite happily and put two thumbs up at me when I opened the shed door. He said, &#8220;nice shed&#8221;. It was all very bizarre.</p>
<p>&#8216;While I was speaking to him he was drinking a carton of orange juice.</p>
<p>&#8216;He then got up and put it in the correct recycling box, almost as if he lived there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Newman called on a friend for advice and the pair demanded to know what he was doing. He said he had been living in the shed for a month because he had &#8216;nowhere else to live&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Newman family took the 26-year-old immigrant to the police station, where officers put him on bail for a public order offence and ordered him not to return to the shed.</p>
<p>But last Sunday he went back and police gave him a final warning.</p>
<p>Miss Newman, who lives in the house with her brother James, 25, and their mother, said: &#8216;We thought we had dealt with the situation but then he came back.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not sure what he wants and I just could not believe he had been there for a month. It is not very nice and I do not like being in the house on my own now.</p>
<p>&#8216;I want the police to do more to stop him from coming back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Newman has put a new lock on the shed in the hope of stopping the man from returning.</p>
<p>Her brother added: &#8216;We sometimes heard running water at night and didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but it turned out he was using the garden hose to wash himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bromley police said: &#8216;We warned the man to stay away from the home when the Newman family brought him into the police station.</p>
<p>&#8216;But they did not want to press charges so we did not take the matter further. If this situation has now changed then they should contact us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is not the first case of its kind. A couple in Kempston, Bedfordshire, found two Polish men in their shed and claimed they tried to eat their daughter&rsquo;s rabbit.</p>
<p>At least six sheds in Peterborough were used as homes by immigrants earlier this month.</p>
<p>Last week a court heard how a Northampton man returned home after forgetting his wallet to find that a Romanian family had moved in.</p>

		<p>This is a really odd story.  Usually when articles are put on this website involving &#8220;Romanians&#8221; we are to assume the author is using a politically correct term for people who are actually dark-skinned gypsies.  But in this case I wonder if the immigrant is actually, in fact, what the article conveys&hellip;. (a WHITE Romanian).  </p>
<p>The reason I think he is white is because his behavior here, while most certainly not ideal, just seems a little more civilized than usual.  Can you imagine a dark-skinned gypsie cleaning up after himself and recycling what he uses?  And the part about him caring enough to place a sheet over the lawn chair to protect it from his dirty body surprised me too.  Then there is the stuff about him hosing himself down every night.  Even though this really isn&rsquo;t an ideal situation for the people who own the shed, and I DO think it is very important for them to contact the police as they have, to me it seems that this man is just some honest white Eastern European who got dealt a bad hand of cards and who is trying to stay alive the best he can without a home to live in, while not disturbing other people in the process.</p>
<p>But then the article goes on to talk about &#8220;Polish&#8221; people eating a pet rabbit and then another case of a &#8220;Romanian&#8221; family actually moving into to someone&rsquo;s house.  Now those two cases sound more typical of actual gypsie behavior.  </p>

		<p>By the way, when you get a chance, you should click on the original article and look at the brother and sister who own the shed.  They are two fine examples of white physical beauty&hellip;.the sister especially.</p>

		<p>Well, this is strange.</p>
<p>In a prior article, I was sure that I read that the British police did nothing. But in this article, they are indeed doing something.</p>
<p>And what sort of man hears water running in the night, and does not get up to investigate? I get up if I hear the slightest noise. If you don&rsquo;t, you just might find your downstairs flooded in the morning.</p>
<p>But I do not doubt this story. I have read it before, in &#8220;The Camp of the Saints&#8221; by Raspail.</p>
<p>The Newmans sound like gentle and sympathetic people, but this is the camel&rsquo;s nose in the tent phenomenon. Soon, he will ask for food. Soon, he will ask to come inside to use the toilet. Soon, he will bring in others to his shed, and they will make similar requests.</p>
<p>It can only escalate. <br>

		<p>Okay, for some reason, my first post didn&rsquo;t go up, which makes my second post above look odd by itself.  In any case, I wrote a very long post going into how I find it odd that the Romanian in this article is actually a &#8220;gypsy&#8221; which is what we would normally assume on this website.  I just can&rsquo;t imagine a gypsy being so civil about recycling and cleaning up after himself etc&hellip;. I was wondering if in this one particular case, this may be an honest WHITE Romanian who is homeless, and trying to survive the best he can while not affecting others.  No, I am not excusing his behavior in the least, but he just seems more civil than your average gypsy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Almost as if he lived there&#8221;<br>
When I was living in my buddy`s garden shed, I always hated that moment of truth  feeling upon returning. When I had to sail under the next door neighbors guns so to speak until I could get inside and out of sight.  <br>
  One day I was too obvious to be ignored. The man next door caught me flatfooted swinging open the back yard gate. But to my surprise he gave me a look of complete knowledge yet still sympathetic and filled with understanding. &#8220;Hey Neighbor&hellip;&#8221; he said quietly. I went inside and almost started to cry. It was the closest I`ve ever come to seeing the eyes of Christ in another human being&hellip; Now my buddy, he was another story.</p>

		<p>How come the  British press can&rsquo;t tell the difference between Romany (Gypsy) and Romanian (person from Romania)? If the average American like myself can easily decipher this, what is stopping them? Could it be an unwillingness to place a true  light upon it, rather than an inability?</p>

		<p>I would bet my bottom dollar that the &#8220;Romanian&#8221; in question is a Gypsy Roma. They are NOT &#8220;Romanian&#8221; at all. Probably also for the two &#8220;Poles&#8221; as well. It now seems that in the U.K. at least, &#8220;Romanian&#8221; or &#8220;eastern European&#8221; is fast becoming code-word for the non-European Gypsy Romani.</p>

		<p>The fact of wether he is &#8220;civil&#8221;or not is beside the point,he has invaded some-one elses property,is living rent free,and where does he complete the usual offices attendant upon human beings?does this woman have to clear up the feces and supply the toilet paper?it is stated that he is homeless,although there is plenty of room in romania,and why is this woman being so nice ?this is a lot different to what my reaction would be in this situation,because at an early stage i would have introduced this creature to MR B BAT.</p>

		<p>No wonder people are confused, as the multicultural brainwashers here in the UK region of the EUSSR never, ever use the term gypsy or Romany but always Romanian. Romanians by-and-large are hard-working law-abiding people who are constantly linked to crime when it is in fact groups of Roumanian gypsies who swarm the UK and cause much bother including one case last week of defrauding the UK welfare system for millions of pounds. Gypsy/Romany/traveller or whatever name they go under are a sainted minority under the laws of the EUSSR and don&rsquo;t they know it. They are a law unto themselves. Under EUSSR law everyone is prized above the indigenous European people. Just like the USA. It&rsquo;s the EUSSR globalists way of giving rights to anyone who is not a citizen of a particular country at the expense of the indigenous people. In other words the One-World government globalists are demolishing white-majority nation-states bit-by-bit. It&rsquo;s genocide by whatever name they choose to call it.</p>

<p>He may have some mental problems and it is hard not to feel a bit sympathetic for the man. He obviously thought what he was doing was okay and was even grateful to the homeowners. If he hadn&rsquo;t started leaving little gifts he may not have been discovered.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a story I read about an elderly Japanese woman that was secretly living in a man&rsquo;s closet for a year. She was neat and clean but he noticed food disappearing out of the fridge. </p>

		<p>These unwelcome &#8220;guests&#8221; are all gypsies.  Gypsies migrated to the West from India.  Gypsies are East Indians.  Historically Europeans have always periodically emptied their nations of gypsies.  Today European politicians welcome and protect these alien degenerates.  It&rsquo;s time the European citizenry empty their nations of gypsies and the political traitors who give them sanctuary&hellip;</p>

		<p>Courtney:</p>
<p>Gypsies (at least, many groups of them) are quite nitpicking about cleanliness *inside* their living quarters.  They have all sorts of rules about clean/dirty:  don&rsquo;t wash clothing bottoms in the same tub with tops, don&rsquo;t wash dishtowels with clothing or bath towels.  The rules come from olden days when everyone lived together in a small wagon and had to wash items in the river:  one needed to pay attention to what was washed upstream from what.  </p>
<p>Superstitions developed about broken items:  if (say) a toaster broke, you had to rid yourself of it immediately (like, dump it out the window).  Similar for breaches of the &#8220;dirty&#8221; rules:  if (say) a piece of underwear fell on top of a dinner fork, the fork went out the window (washing it would be insufficient).  These &#8220;policies&#8221; account for the messes one sees outside apartment buildings with large Gypsy populations.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely that the Romanian squatter (assuming he was Gypsy) was trying his best to keep some discipline w.r.t. clean/dirty by adapting his old rules to modern recycling rules.<br>

Actually they can,but they choose not to,as Gypsies(Roma)and Travellers(Irish)are protected under the Race Relations Act and any slur on them would be construed as a &#8220;Hate&#8221;crime.The words Slovak and Romanian have become coded synonyms for Gypsy,while &#8220;East European&#8221; almost invariably alludes to Albanians. </p>

<p>You misunderstand. Of course Romania is a Latin country but within that country and others their is a minority group of gypsies whose origins are from India. Also, most people from India are not gypsies. This is a distinct group.There are very few gypsies in the USA.</p>

<p>Gypsies tend to behave submissively and feign gratitude as long as there is the slightest chance of you giving them whatever they crave (mostly pecuniary donations)but if you don`t give in to their tenacious requests they will resort to obscenities and utter curses. They are also renowned for their sticky fingers. Since the expansion of the European Union to the east and the accompanying open-border agreements, their numbers have been rapidly increasing in Western Europe. The gypsies can be credited with transforming the city of Rome into the Western European capital of pickpocketing.</p>
