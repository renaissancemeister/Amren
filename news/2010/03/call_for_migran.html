			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melissa Maddison, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hospitality training group says it is vital that Federal Government recognises the major skills shortage facing the industry.</p>
<p>Hostec International&rsquo;s Raman Nabian says there is a shortage of about 1,000 chefs per month around Australia.</p>
<p>He says that figure could increase if hospitality is not included in a new list of preferred skills for migrant workers.</p>
<p>Mr Nambian says there are not enough Australians interested in hospitality to fill all the vacancies.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s been several attempts at this over the last 20, 30 years and nothing seems to really hit home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the recent interest in shows like Masterchef, it just hasn&rsquo;t attracted Australians to that profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of young school leavers that go into cookery as a profession is dropping.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I guarantee that there exists a salary and benefits package at which an ample supply of Australian citizens would be eager to be chefs.  But of course our corporate masters don&rsquo;t want to pay it.</p>
<p>Capitalists don&rsquo;t believe in free markets when it means they have to raise their bid.</p>

		<p>Then chefs will be more valuable and wages will rise causing more people to go into that field.  It&rsquo;s called supply and demand.  When you import from outside it skews that relationship and is like cheating.</p>

		<p>Another profession that Australia says they need is beauticians. In fact, I read where one couple was able to immigrate to Australia because the wife had a cosmetology license.</p>

<p>Sounds like George Bush a few years ago talking about &#8220;jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. They are certainly not going to be executive chefs on a dishwashers salary. You can teach people to be line cooks, but to move up the ranks and do the job well requires a lot of grey matter. No they won&rsquo;t put up with the demands of a chef for a $30,000 salary. This may get you some junior managers for a fast food chain, but not people who really know what they are doing in the kitchen. </p>
<p>Read the book &#8220;Kitchen Confidential&#8221; by Anthony Bourdain to get an idea of what it is like to work in restaurants at this level. It is not an easy job. Pay particular attention to a chapter called &#8220;Owner&rsquo;s Syndrome and Other Medical Anomalies&#8221;. Gordon Ramsey berating his charges on &#8220;Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen&#8221; is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>I would imagine that the differences between an executive chef for a 5 star restaurant in NYC and Sydney are pretty minimal. If you want good help, you have to pay for it. </p>

		<p>Interesting. My uncle (an apprenticed butcher and charcutier) immigrated to Australie in 1948 from Czechoslovakia in the age of 24 years. Most of his life he spent as a cook and he married an Anglo-Australian girl who specialized in wedding cake-baking. Apparently, cooks were sought in Australia even 60 yrs ago.</p>

		<p>OH, Australians just do not want to be chefs anymore. [or waiters or bus boys or waitresses or butchers anymore for that matter also!]</p>
<p>OH, Australians just do not want to be mechanics anymore. [we just cannot find anyone that can repair a Mercedes anymore!]</p>
<p>OH, Australians just do not want to be hotel maids anymore.</p>
<p>OH, Australians just do not want to ranchers or farmers anymore.</p>
<p>OH, Australians just do not want to work in seasonal work anymore. [sheep shearing!]</p>
<p>Etc., etc., etc. Have heard it all before somewhere.</p>

<p>I suspect he is White, likely Christian and therefore desirable. NOT black, dark brown and muslim e.g. UNdesirable. The muslims are what is gonna cause you Ozzites so much trouble, especially the Lebanese and Pakistanis.</p>

		<p>It is quite true there are certain jobs that require extremely little training or ability and very little apart from the ability to push a broom or suchlike. It is also true that those jobs pay very little. When a government pays someone at that low level to do nothing, in the form of various types of welfare, it is quite true that the local population is not prepared to accept those jobs. There is a very simple formula, the higher the support payments, the fewer low paid jobs get filled. By the same token, the lower the support payments, the more jobs get taken. With welfare the government gains in two ways, the ones who get imported as a condition of accepting those low paid jobs are beholden and will vote for the ones that let them in and the ones who are now living on welfare are equally beholden. Business is equally happy, most taxes to pay for all that are raised from consumers, the business share has been getting smaller by the year.</p>

<p>Ozzies should try to nip this one in the bud. &#8220;Hospitality work&#8221; can be defined broadly enough to include &#8220;skills&#8221; possessed by EVERY THIRD WORLDER EVER BORN. It will set the bar for admission to Australia so low that the dumbest, most hostile and most undesirable of the Wretched of the Earth [TM] may qualify. Utterly unskilled and uneducated individuals who offer a First World country NOTHING. Your average African village woman may have an IQ of 70, a Third Grade education, a water jar on her head, and a tendency to get herself pregnant by a different sperm-donor every 10 months   &mdash;   but if she knows how to <i>cook</i>, and that may be enough to get her through your big white door&hellip; </p>
<p>&hellip;At which point she will make her own special contribution to Australia by helping to turn it into Africa. </p>
