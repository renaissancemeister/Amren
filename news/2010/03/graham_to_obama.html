<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34162.html">Graham to Obama: Time to &#8216;Step It Up&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Glenn Thrush, Politico, March 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama is summoning two key senators to the Oval Office on Thursday for an update on immigration reform efforts  &mdash;  but one of them, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), thinks Obama should be the one giving the update.</p>
<p>Graham, less than thrilled at the notion of providing the equivalent of a book report to the headmaster in chief, said Obama&rsquo;s lack of direction on immigration reform is hampering Graham&rsquo;s efforts to recruit additional Republicans to the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, the president needs to step it up a little bit,&#8221; Graham told POLITICO on Tuesday. &#8220;One line in the State of the Union is not going to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the past six months, Graham and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)  &mdash;  who meet with Obama at 3 p.m. Thursday  &mdash;  have worked on a reform framework. Their plan, which hasn&rsquo;t been introduced yet, includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (a liberal must-have) while sweetening the pot for moderates by proposing tough new safeguards, including a biometric national ID card for workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Graham said he wants a greater sense of direction to break the cycle of distrust that doomed comprehensive immigration reform during the Bush administration, despite the support of a Republican president and major party figures like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</p>
<p>&#8220;I think moderate Democrats have to come on board before you get Republicans, and Republicans have to come on board before you get Democrats,&#8221; said Graham.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While many Democrats publicly embrace comprehensive reform, most are privately rooting for inertia rather than tying themselves to any proposal that could be used against them in the midterms.</p>
<p>The tough part for Obama, however, is that the Obama-Graham-Schumer summit is also being closely watched by Hispanic groups, who are demanding proof of action as a reward for their overwhelming support of Obama in 2008.</p>
<p>With a massive March 21 pro-immigration reform rally planned for Washington, and Latinos the fastest-growing segment of the electorate, Obama can ill afford to alienate them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigration reform, he [Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a Cuban-American] added, &#8220;would seal the community&rsquo;s commitment to the Democratic Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>That opinion is shared by a collection of Hispanic groups, who have pressured the White House in forceful terms, threatening to withdraw support if Obama doesn&rsquo;t follow through on his commitment.</p>

		<p>And Graham&rsquo;s desire to legalize illegal mestizo is because, in his own words, he knew a Hispanic officer in the military who took him &#8220;under his wings&#8221; and showed him the ropes.  In addition he said the Hispanic was dressed so clean he &#8220;could literally eat off his uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kind of makes a person wonder if this troubled man is playing with a full deck, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>He said the only whites opposing amnesty were racists.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s too dimwitted to know that Hispanics wouldn&rsquo;t be so generous to whites if the situation were reversed and that there is FAR FAR more &#8220;racism&#8221; within the non-white community?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t, of course, and it is the unfortunate luck of whites to have leaders who are out-of-touch do-gooder fools, while the non-white leaders are ALL pulling for their people and ONLY THEIR PEOPLE.</p>

		<p>First it was healthcare 24/7.  Now it&rsquo;s amnesty 24/7.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t they be first and formost concerned about jobs?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting 10 to 1 the unemployment figure of 9.7 for February was padded to give the impression jobs are holding steady to allow cover for this community organizer to pursue his pro-black agenda.</p>
<p>He must get his healthcare bill passed, because it contains mandates to accept unqualified blacks into med schools and private practice.  Look for the tests to become dumbed down as well.  (If it isn&rsquo;t now included in the healthcare bill as well.)</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s lack of direction on immigration reform is hampering Graham&rsquo;s efforts to recruit additional Republicans to the cause</p>
<p><br>
Lol&hellip;.what is hampering efforts to &#8220;recruit additional republicans to the cause&#8221; is the fact that the republican party is currently on the cusp of a changing of the guard.  Before Obama, it was taken for granted that the old republican guard (which amnesty was one of their platforms under McCain) lead by Bush, had failed so miserably and so completely that the republican party was finished as a viable political entity.  They had one last chance under McCain to differentiate themselves as NOT being in the pocket of shadowy forces destroying our country.  They didn&rsquo;t do it.  The result was disaster.  People did not trust Obama (despite all the hype).  People KNEW what he was but were willing to try ANYTHING to get the republicans out.  They figured, well, at least we&rsquo;ll get out of the middle east foreverwar.  Yeah&hellip;that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>The democrats proved themselves to be far worse than the republicans ever were.  Now, the republicans are back from the dead.  But, there is a problem.  Nobody has forgotten what the old guard did and what they stand for.  There is REAL power behind a movement to marginalize and probably defund the federal government and run things on the state level instead.  This will probably happen sooner than later unless the republican party changes drastically.  Enter the tea party folks which slowly seem to be integrating into the republican party and replacing the old guard with their own people.</p>
<p>So you see and will continue to see republican candidates avoiding issues like amnesty in the hopes of avoiding being replaced by new candidates that are specifically against things like amnesty. You will even see DEMOCRATIC candidates doing this and some new faces in the democratic party, replacing some of their rank and file.</p>
<p>People have HAD it.  One way or another there will be real change in this country.  Dismantlement of the warfare/welfare state, kicking out of immigrants, slashed spending, perhaps default on the national debt.  Either it will happen on the federal level or the US will break up into smaller states as large swathes of the country choose to do this no matter what the feds say.</p>
<p>As a last resort, I can&rsquo;t help but notice that this year alone, more guns were bought by private citizens than are in the hands of the world&rsquo;s top 25 militaries (ours included) combined.  Although some people are stocking up ahead of potential gun grabs (there are so many guns in the US that this is beyond unrealistic for us), that excuse sounds pretty thin to me.</p>
<p>Why are all the guns being bought?</p>
<p>Because people have had it.  Not individuals or groups but communities, states and large clusters of states.</p>

<p>Flimsy Grahamnesty has a law degree.  And yet, he was evidently bowled over by some Hispanic in whatever branch of the Armed Forces they served?  I&rsquo;m guessing Grahamnesty&rsquo;s father ran both the law school and the state bar such that Mr. Intellectual-outwitted-by-a-Hispanic Grunt could graduate from law school and pass the bar.</p>

<p>I was reading an amazing article yesterday.  It was amazing because it was a Christian conservative (&#8220;religious right&#8221;) organization that loves Lincoln and equality predicting a USSR-style breakup of the United States, thanks to an unsustainable debt and spending pace.  It pondered the economic prospects of newly independent former American states, and some might make out well for their natural resources.  Unfortunately, I quipped yesterday, Missouri is doomed unless mud and mosquitoes become highly prized commodities on the world market.</p>

		<p>The very fact that so many South Carolinians voted Graham back into office for another SIX LONG YEARS, inspires me to write, STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES. It&rsquo;s unbelievable because Graham called Americans bigots and every other name because they didn&rsquo;t agree with his first support of amnesty attempt some years ago. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES. It&rsquo;s like the one poster that goes under the name, KULACKS NEVER LEARN. RIGHT YOU ARE!!</p>

<p>At least this is more logical than the absolutely laughable claim that immigration reform would&rsquo;ve sealed Hispanic voters to the GOP.</p>
<p>The 1986 amnesty was passed by a GOP-controlled Senate and signed by a Republican president, yet Hispanics sure didn&rsquo;t switch to the Republicans after that.</p>

		<p>Lindsay Graham is a homosexaul-just read his comments about the hispanic officers clean uniform-and a traitor. It is shocking that Southern White Evangelical Christians voted him into office when they could have voted for a patriotic immigration reformer.</p>

		<p>Perhaps #5 it is because SC is being invaded by Hispanics. This is what a friend of mine tells me who lives down there. Perhaps the invaders-legal or not- are voting for this piece of trash Senator? I believe they (whites) had a chance to be rid of him recently and his opponent was a conservative Dem. Unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t happen. Graham is a good reason to put no faith in the GOP. </p>

		<p>voters in s.c. should vote lindsey graham out of office once and for all, and be sure to replace him with a hispanic politician. maybe that should teach him a lesson. if we get immigration reform in this country and there is a great influx from south of the border, i personally will vote for every hispanic politician that runs, because it is for sure, our white politicians dont represent us. maybe a hispanic will do a better job of it.</p>

		<p>You know, I may be obtuse and I know I&rsquo;m not the sharpest crayon in the box, but I have long said that it doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to understand that economy is tied to jobs, jobs are tied to immigration. Therefore, the economy is tied to immigration. </p>
<p>Every single job in the U.S. that is taken by (or given to) an immigrant, whether it be illegal OR legal is a job not available to a U.S. citizen. Every single job that is &#8216;outsourced&rsquo; (I hate that word; it sounds so much more sanitary than &#8216;sent overseas&rsquo;) is a job that&rsquo;s not available to a U.S. citizen. It&rsquo;s not hard, folks. When your country is drowning in debt, when it&rsquo;s imploding due to massive layoffs, tax hikes, business closings and housing foreclosures, it&rsquo;s absolute insanity to let anyone from outside the country to come in and be employed here. The first action of an administration should be to temporarily halt all [legal] immigration. Illegal immigration should (and could be) halted every single day of every single year, regardless. It&rsquo;s clear when an administration looks the other way that they are much more concerned about hurting the feelings of foreigners than they are the American who has paid taxes for years, is paying their salary,who just got laid off, lost their insurance, lost their house and is now dealing with cancer. Which, by the way takes that employee off the earning roll, taxpayer roll, and puts him on the welfare funded roll, which completes the circle by adding to the taxes required.</p>
<p>Taxes should NEVER be hiked on U.S. citizens to pay for non-citizens, most of them criminals by virtue of them breaking our law stepping over our border, while those same U.S. citizens lose the benefits they have earned and are entitled to. This whole issue makes me crazy. It&rsquo;s so basic, so simple, and so straightforward (not to mention economically profitable), it&rsquo;s totally ludicrous for conditions in this country to be the way they are.</p>
<p>School funding has been cut to the bone because it has been so hugely burdened by special needs such as free breakfasts, lunches, Resource Officers, grief counselors, more teachers for foreign speaking children, etc., - things that have nothing whatsoever to do with actually EDUCATING AAMERICAN children. The schools&rsquo; job is educating. Americans. Not feeding, not counseling, and not daycare. The amount of money thrown toward social services and medical services used up by illegals is mind boggling. All of that must be paid by you and I.Who in turn, lose our own benefits to pay theirs.</p>
<p>Taxes wouldn&rsquo;t have to be raised a penney, and America would be swimming in money if three things were actually addressed in a common sense way: immigration, job outsourcing, and implementing a work-for welfare program, in which all able-bodied welfare recipients were required to put in a 40 hour work week doing anything and were drug tested in order to receive their benefits. They could pick up trash, they could sweep, clean windows, mop government and public buildings cut grass, rake leaves - any menial, trivial little job that could be found. Government payrolls would be sliced in half. </p>
<p>It makes me absolutely crazy that any 200 randomly picked people off the street could govern this country better than those who have put themselves in the position of doing so. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see how amnesty can pass given the state of the US economy.  If I&rsquo;m wrong and it does pass, the mess we&rsquo;re in will really start to sink in with many whites. </p>
<p>To be honest, I think a healthy percentage of whites have known for decades what the long-term consequences would be of unrestricted third-world immigration.  But as long as the economy kept cooking along and they could buy fancy cars, flatscreen TVs, and other imported junk they don&rsquo;t really need, they elected not to make too much of a fuss about it.  Sadly, this tells much about human nature.           </p>
