<h1>Woman Vows to Only Shop at Black-Owned Stores</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Benson, KSHB-TV (Kansas City, Missouri), February 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} But one local woman&rsquo;s goal benefits an entire community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve made a commitment to shop only black-owned businesses for an entire year,&#8221; said Lora McDonald.</p>
<p>As a social worker, McDonald found she was earning a living off working with blacks and wanted to find a way to put some of that money back into the black community. She decided to patronize only black-owned businesses for an entire year.</p>
<p>In two months McDonald has struggled with singling out those stores to meet all of her needs. She has, however, found the only black-owned grocery store in Kansas City  &mdash;  Leon&rsquo;s Thriftway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their service is incredible, like I never carry my own groceries to my car,&#8221; said McDonald.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McDonald has 10 months to go on her year-long journey. If you know of any black-owned businesses she could add to her list, e-mail NBC Action News Reporter Lisa Benson at benson@nbcactionnews.com.</p>

<p>If anyone has ever drove through a black neighborhood with a grocery store, they know they&rsquo;re dilapidated buildings with old neon signs and bars on the doors and windows.  There&rsquo;s usually low life thugs hanging around in the parking lot.  I hope whatever money this woman was paid for this stunt is worth it if she ends up robbed, beaten and raped.</p>

Which is more pathetic, the paucity of black enterprise or the twisted minds of white marxists?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s at least give Leon&rsquo;s Thriftway their due.  If Leon can learn to open a successful grocery store, maybe one day some Whites can learn to be racially conscious.</p>

<p>As a social worker, she was earning a living off TAXPAYERS, mostly White taxpayers. And her services were benefiting mostly Black citizens. She is under NO obligation to &#8220;pay back&#8221; the Black community. They got theirs already. What a dingbat. </p>

		<p>She wanted to shop black-owned businesses because she feels guilty over making a living working with black clients as a social worker.  By social worker, I presume they mean a welfare caseworker, in which case it&rsquo;s viva Missouri taxpayers, almost entirely provided by whites.  In that case, she should shop white-owned businesses if she feels that guilty.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m trapped in a horribly diverse city, and if I tried to shop only Black-owned stores for a week I could not do it! Every small store around me is owned by Pakis-whether a chain franchise or a mom and pop. The only independent small groceries are owned by Asians. <br>
She feels so proud of her idiocy. </p>

<p>Gee, so rare.  I don&rsquo;t know what most grocery stores are like in her neck of the woods.  But where I&rsquo;m from I could have groceries carried to my car each and every time from most any grocery store in town.</p>
<p>I bet she gets into hot-water for this statement.  Blacks will be offended by her taking a &#8220;black job&#8221; and the idea of black workers schleping her groceries for her.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first Amren article bringing attention to people who have vowed to shop only at black-owned businesses.  Isn&rsquo;t it time we establish lists of white-owned businesses that we can patronize?  Of course, such a list would be useful mainly in large cities which are primarily non-white.</p>

<p>I think she has that backwards.  She&rsquo;s EARNING a living off white folks&rsquo; taxes and instituted social programs&hellip;  She&rsquo;s MAKING a living off blacks folks&rsquo; problems.  Big difference.<br>

<p>Jeesh, where do white people like McDonald come from?  McDonald&rsquo;s earnings are paid for by mostly white taxpayers.  So if she really wants to contribute her money back to the people who provide for her living she&rsquo;d shop only at white owned stores.<br>

		<p>Maybe I will contact my local newspaper and vow to never shop at Black owned businesses. I wonder what the reaction will be? ha! </p>
<p>Again in my multi-culti Northeastern city there are almost no black owned stores. There are a sprinkling of clothing shops that cater to the urban overgrown toddler look: oversize pants, garish colors, puffy sneakers. Only the stupidest white &#8216;wannabes&rsquo; wear such attire so I&rsquo;ll never shop there. There are also a couple of soul food places and a Jamaican grill. That&rsquo;s it in a region of 500,000 people. Wait a minute, I forgot the most common black enterprise-black only hair salons. <br>
Blacks make their businesses too easy to boycott.</p>

		<p>If she has to put out an appeal via NBC to find black owned businesses she has already proved the point. There is no need to put out an appeal to discover White businesses patronised by blacks but I bet the owners wish this was not the case. Another story on this AMREN page covers HBCUs but surely some of the thousands of highly educated successful black graduates have set up businesses just for blacks but don&rsquo;t want to make this public just in case they are inundated with even more &#8216;customers&rsquo; or perhaps they discovered the blatant truth&hellip;and just given up a hopeless task. If Leon&rsquo;s Thriftway satisfy all her needs, why look elsewhere? Leon may not be too happy about this although it must be nice to have one customer that is not going to shoplift or throw a loud abusive hissy-fit about the lack of credit facilities! I bet she gets all kind of wonderful supportive comments from staff if she tries to shop at &#8216;White&rsquo; stores, all of whom will have a picture of her above each check-out. I think her career is doomed and confined to dealing with black &#8216;clients&rsquo; for evermore, or at least until the blacks insist she be replaced with one of their own. Tee Hee!!</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&#8221;I&rsquo;ve made a commitment to shop only black-owned businesses for an entire year,&#8221; said Lora McDonald.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned never to underestimate the zealotry of a fool like McDonald, but my guess is that there is no way whatsoever that she will live up to her so-called commitment. In fact, I don&rsquo;t believe that she really IS committed to such an idiotic goal but will make a superficial effort for the sake of appearances. Her point is made without actually doing anything. As usual when race is the issue, the pose itself is sufficient. </p>
<p>Her fellow black-worshipping whites will get the warm &#8216;n&rsquo; fuzzies, she&rsquo;ll get pats on the back from other sanctimonious racists, and blacks will be further emboldened to take advantage of white naiveté. <br>

		<p>The only black owned stores that I ever patronized were liquor stores when I was in high school. Invariably, there was always a neighborhood drunk outside the store who would buy us booze for a pack of smokes and a bottle of ripple. Then we got out of dodge as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>The cops wouldn&rsquo;t really bother them about straw purchases for underage drinkers. These places tended to have illegal gambling upstairs and out of sight and engaged in massive food stamp fraud (back in the paper stamp days). Needless to say, the police had more pressing issues to deal with. Besides most of the police officers I knew probably did the same thing when they were in high school. </p>
<p>If this woman wishes to assuage her guilt for the lack of industriousness of her clients, be my guest. I&rsquo;m sure AMREN will run an article in six months about this woman being beaten/robbed/raped, etc. </p>

<p>The irony being only AmRen, the people she hates, will report on it, definitely not all the facts, if AmRen can dig up the story.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;As a social worker, McDonald found she was earning a living off working with blacks and wanted to find a way to put some of that money back into the black community. She decided to patronize only black-owned businesses for an entire year.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she is effectively boycotting Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern and white (not that they matter) businesses. </p>
<p>What a racist.</p>

		<p>What about her garbage collector?? Is he White?<br>
I hope she doesn&rsquo;t get sick and have to go to a Black hospital.<br>
Her local phone company or power company&hellip;white owned and run?<br>
Car trouble..Black mechanic? Needs gas for her car? Black owned station?</p>
<p>She is so clueless, as said before in other posts, she felt like giving back to the people she made a living off? That would be the WHITE taxpayers!!!<br>
I always thought brainless liberals like her where only a myth, I guess I was wrong.<br>
