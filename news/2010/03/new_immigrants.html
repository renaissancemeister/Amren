<h1>New Immigrants Avoiding Big Cities, Study Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel B. Wood, Christian Science Monitor, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New immigrants and their US-born descendants are expected to grow by 117 million by 2050, making up 82 percent of the US population growth over that period, and will &#8220;have important implications for housing demand at a time when aging baby boomers are expected to retire and leave the housing market,&#8221; the study predicts.</p>
<p>New immigrants who once flocked to the large &#8220;gateway&#8221; cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago are now heading for smaller metropolitan areas like Detroit and Minneapolis, Colorado Springs, Colo., Sarasota, Fla., and El Paso, Tex., according to the study, released by the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California. The census data used for the study didn&rsquo;t take into account respondents&rsquo; legal status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every city in the US is getting a sizable immigration population,&#8221; said Gary Painter, director of research at the Lusk Center and co-author of the study, in a phone interview. &#8220;We are no longer a country where immigration is largely confined to just a few places.&#8221;</p>
<p>The typical immigrant seen in these new places is likely to have been in the US fewer than 10 years, he says, whereas the typical immigrant in a larger city has likely been here much longer. The implication of this is that new immigrants probably have less English language skills, are less likely to be integrated, and are less likely to own a home.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study, &#8220;Immigrants and Housing Markets in Mid-Size Metropolitan Areas&#8221; by Painter and co-author Zhou Yu, an assistant professor at the University of Utah, looked at census data from 2000 to 2005 in 60 cities with housing priced lower than in the major gateway cities. Over those five years, these mid-size areas showed an average 27 percent rise in new immigrant population at the same time that more traditional gateways registered a 6 percent decline.</p>
<p>Painter and Yu found that immigrants continue to have lower homeownership rates than native-born Americans having the same income and education levels. &#8220;Many of these immigrants may be waiting for other family members to join them before setting down more permanent roots,&#8221; explained Painter, who plans future research into the disparity in homeownership rates. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some immigrants&rsquo; rights groups say the move to smaller cities makes sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the negative attitudes towards immigrants, the incessant persecution by immigration agents, and the lack of jobs,&#8221; says Jorge-Mario Cabrera of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, &#8220;immigrants may believe that smaller cities offer all the right options: a place to live unnoticed, a somewhat welcoming environment, and less competition for lower-paying jobs.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of course.  They screwed up the big cities, now they don&rsquo;t want to be around the environments where they screwed up, so they are,  as Mr. Cabrera suggested, moving on to greener pastures that won&rsquo;t be green for much longer.  Where he is wrong is that most of the bigger cities mentioned here are sanctuary cities, so there is virtually no enforcement of immigration law in those cities.</p>
<p>VDare had a story a few years ago about a Hispanic woman who moved herself and her family from L.A. to Lexington, Kentucky, because, (exact quote), &#8220;L.A. is too full of Hispanics.&#8221;  So will Lexington after awhile.</p>

		<p>I have done extensive driving through different cities in different states.  The cities I&rsquo;ve driven through are large, mid-size and small.  I&rsquo;ve driven through rural areas and everywhere I&rsquo;ve gone I&rsquo;ve seen Mexicans - everywhere.  For the government to continue underestimating the total number of illegal aliens in the U.S. to be about 12 million is just plain ridiculous.  It has to be in the 25-35 million range.  There are probably as many illegal aliens in this country as there are Blacks.  And then for some to claim that non-Hispanic Whites still comprise 65 percent of the population is nothing but a falsehood.  If you factor in at least 25 million of them we are more like 60 percent of the population and dropping extremely rapidly.  The projection that we are going to be a minority in 2042 is absurd.  We are going to be a minority in 10-15 years.  But you know these underestimations of the illegal population are made to lull us into a false sense of security, to anesthetize our natural defense mechanisms until the plan of our destruction is completed.</p>

		<p>There is a song on one of Bob Rivers&rsquo; CDs, &#8220;Twisted Christmas,&#8221; called &#8220;Foreigners&#8221; - to the tune of &#8220;Gloria in Excelsis Deo&#8221; - that is absolutely perfect for the main theme of this article.  It basically features a Mexican guy coming into California illegally, and he says how easy it is, how great it is, and finally asks, &#8220;When you gonna shut the door?&#8221; (punctuated by a door slam).

<p>Or in other words, are utterly abject and alien invaders!</p>
<p>Nonwhites offer absolutely nothing to this country, particularly when we are in the death throes of the fading multicultural paradigm General Secretary Obama personifies. The ever maudlin and discordant sanctimony over: &ldquo;new immigrants,&rdquo; &ldquo;deserving refugees,&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;sainted undocumented,&rdquo; are only hysterical pretenses used by a discredited &ldquo;elite&rdquo; to colonize this country and satisfy their genocidal sadomasochisms. So deranged are they now with distress and despondency, they cannot decide if it is better to receive a lash or deliver it; thus, they attempt both at once. </p>
<p>However, they are so comfortable with what &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;should engorge&rdquo; their delusional feeding on hubris, that they forget how utterly useless they really are. Thus, they perpetuate their absurd existences, with a hallucinatory arrogance that becomes oppressively stagnating to all who do actually dwell in harsh reality. </p>
<p>In other words, they overwhelm anyone normal through their fancifully perverse preoccupations, simply because most outside this rainbow vanguard, cannot or will not believe such foolishness has become the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of our politics and the socioeconomics that flow from them. This is because up until now, our material and geographical &ldquo;comfort zones,&rdquo; were reasonably safe from the totality of these noxious infections from above.</p>
<p>Not so anymore!</p>
<p>Or better put, may God let it begin our unquestioned salvation!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Every city in the US is getting a sizable immigration population.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Here we go again with some scam artist stupidly trying to convince everyone he can see 40 years into the future, hoping they will accept more mass immigration, because there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done about it.</p>
<p>Hey, genius! Before telling us what&rsquo;s going to happen 40 years from now can you let us know what will happen when the other shoe falls on commercial real estate and ARMs for residential real estate?</p>
<p>How about the encrouchment of the cartels into the US and their spread to 200 cities per Homeland Defense estimates?  And what if Mexico falls to the drug gangs and the US has to move on Mexico? </p>
<p>What if we fall into a second Great Depression as many are expecting?  Will that increase or decrease those foreigners who are here now?</p>
<p>Sorry, old boy, but you aren&rsquo;t what we would consider the epitome of advance knowledge on anything, especially since you never correctly forecast a single occurrence or demographic in the last 20 years, especially the sub-primecrash.</p>
<p>Hpw about an expert forecast for the year 2100, old boy?  Can you look into the tea leaves and tell us what the situation will be then?</p>
<p>Also, can you tell us that if trends were to show that 10 million Europeans will emigrate into the US by 2050 and 20 million non-whites will return home you would report that as well with as much eagerness and gusto?</p>
<p>Somehow I&rsquo;m thinking you wouldn&rsquo;t bother.  I wonder why not.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re avoiding the big cities because there are already too many of them there, and as a result, they&rsquo;ve fouled things up big-time, and they must know it. Blacks and Hispanics go to where white people are the majority, because it is in those locales that they can find pleasant surroundings (only for as long as whites as the majority, of course). This is true not only of the United States but of developed countries in general.</p>
<p>As for moving to Detroit, I venture to say they&rsquo;re moving to the cities around Detroit. A buddy of mine once used to work for GM, and he loved Michigan, but he always advised me to steer clear of Detroit, because it was almost all black. I imagine third worlders are doing the same.<br>

<p>We&rsquo;ve passed the tipping point and our White America is now fading, but our White taxes are still paying for it.</p>
<p><br>
The brown black yellow red coalitions will not create enough wealth through invention, achievement, and success to pay the interest on government debt. They system will collapse, but since Whites will be so outnumbered and surrounded, nature will rise again in numbers and the non whites will slaughter our men and enslave our wives and children. Our beautiful blonde blue eyed will become sex slaves in mestizo and afrothug harems.</p>
<p>History teaches all you need to know.  FoxNews and Amren will have been closed down for years by the time this certain fate arrives.   Gun confiscation will have been successful under the ADL&rsquo;s hate crimes enforcement.</p>
<p>The only justice will be poetic.  The non white coalition will not discriminate in favor of the liberal White elites who caused the mess. Their bloodlines will also become mongrelized.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about the massive influx from Mexico and Central America  &mdash;  it goes to every county that these guys can find a job. The number of counties more than 95% white has declined drastically over the last 20 years for precisely that reason. The only counties left that are heavily white are those where there are no jobs  &mdash;  Appalachia, southern Illinois, parts of Missouri&hellip; </p>

		<p>We do not need anymore immigrants in this country.  We are full and overpopulated. I see it everyday with Blacks and immigrants (mostly arrogant ones from India), the Hindu that speak Hindi and and live in McMansions with every relative they can find.  They can apply for SSI for their elderly parents and the younger ones with aranged marriages and their kids apply for WIC. Naturally, they buy all the businesses with Affirmative Action privlege with loans from the Small Business Association (not white males no, no).  The Chinese are just as bad right along with the Arabs in and all around Detroit, Saginaw, MI where we whites need jobs.  These immigrants will not hire whites or blacks, just their family members and extended family members that work for free or under the table.  They have invaded my nice peaceful suburb of Saginaw Township and act like they own everything.  Most have huge homes in their country of orgin and are here as parasites living on white money and white taxes.</p>
<p>All these immigrants have protected immigrant privilege from the U.S. Government (no, no not whites that created this country and its&rsquo; institutions).  The latest is the Arabs in Detroit want to change the U.S. Census as they have been classified as White to Arab since they can cry for more money and freebies and want to be a minority.  I am so distraught when I see these arrogant people in my library, my neighborhood and they did nothing to create this country, they have no loyalty or allegiance to this country or our soldiers and no they will not fight in war (no, no just whitey can).</p>
<p>Again, Saginaw, MI (the city) has earned the most violent crime rate for a city it&rsquo;s size) compliments of the FBI,(blacks killing blacks as usual. </p>

		<p>Great comments, everyone. I would just like to add a comment about the first paragraph:</p>
<p><i>New immigrants and their US-born descendants are expected to grow by 117 million by 2050, making up 82 percent of the US population growth over that period, and will &ldquo;have important implications for housing demand at a time when aging baby boomers are expected to retire and leave the housing market,&rdquo; the study predicts.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure that one out. Is the study saying the &#8220;aging baby boomers&#8221; will be homeless?  Otherwise, how is it they will &#8220;leave the housing market&#8221;? Like people don&rsquo;t move around after they retire or get a second house somewhere?</p>

		<p>The entire North and South American continents are homogenizing. What Brazil looks like today is what the USA will look like in the near future. Shanty Towns will become common around large population centers. Non-Whites, as evidenced in this article, will relentlessly find White areas and move to them, and destroy them in the process&hellip;the cancer metaphor for non-Whites seems very appropriate.</p>

<p>Hope this is tongue in cheek?  I hear this so often from White people, and they act like they don&rsquo;t have kids and grand kids! They are the ones who are going to suffer! That is who I worry about and not whether I am dead or alive! Since when has the White race become so callous about their own descendants and their future? It will be OUR fault that we made a hell on earth for them since we are really doing nothing to stop the multi-cult insanity.</p>

		<p>To poster #2:  Yes, you are so right and I have been under this realization for a long time.  Whites are less than 60% of the population now (if you take out all the central asians, arabs, dominicans, puerto ricans, afghanis, etc. that our gov&rsquo;t counts as &#8216;white.&rsquo;)</p>

		<p>  It has been a deliberate policy of &#8220;our&#8221; government to settle Third World refugees outside of major cities in order to bring the blessings of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; to the whole country.  Bringing Somalis to Lewiston Maine is just one on many examples. As for the increase in Mexicans in rural areas, they usually come as cheap farm workers or slaughter house workers and then stay permanently. Many Mexicans know that areas with high concentrations of whites are generally the most desirable, economically viable and crime free areas to live. Of course, this will all change once whites become the minority in another twenty years.  At that time the United (by force) States will become another Brazil &mdash; a grim Soviet style Brazil, a Brazil without the fun.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m always mystified when the illegal alien cheerleaders say, &#8220;we can&rsquo;t deport all these illegals, especially those who&rsquo;ve been here for many years.&#8221; Do I understand then the longer you&rsquo;ve committed the crime of being here illegally, the better your chances for deserving amnesty? By the time they jump the border, then present false documents, fake names and stolen IDs, they&rsquo;ve committed several felonies - but, hey, that&rsquo;s okay, because they&rsquo;re &#8220;POOR.&#8221; Well, by all income charts, so am I. If I decided to rob a bank because of my financial status, I&rsquo;d be looking at 10 to 20. Their fate? They are rewarded with citizenship (just as soon as Obamacare is passed).</p>

		<p>Some of you have no doubt seen the Dustin Hoffman film &#8220;Outbreak.&#8221;  A flesh eating, highly contagious disease must be quarantined in a small western town or else it could be spread throughout the country in days.  An expert in a giant boardroom is spelling out the scenario for top officials, they are trying to decide if it would be just to eradicate the town with a bomb controlling the disease.  He has a large overhead screen showing the town on a map of the US and how it will spread.  Day 1, day 2, day 3&hellip; completely covering the US.  That&rsquo;s what this reminds me of.  Cities are long gone.  Smaller middle America needs to protect itself at all costs.  Who&rsquo;s going to save your property, your livelihood, or your daughters?  Who is going to preserve your rights and your heritage?  Our own government is forcing this!  How will you protect yourself?  The thousands of American rural counties, townships, and villages must be preserved.  That is the REAL backbone of America.  Once they fall all is lost.  Forever. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a stupid belief (but unfortunately a deeply ingrained one) in America that states when a city gets big it causes high crime rates.</p>
<p>Of course a race realist knows the true answer.<br>
When you have a disproportionate number of (Blacks + Hispanics), the crime rate goes up. As we know big cities in the USA have a disproportionately large number of non-whites. </p>
<p>Ask any American, &#8220;Why does Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore have such low crime rates even though they are really big cities?&#8221;<br>
The really sad part is most Americans have been so brainwashed they simply cannot figure it out.</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s a great attitude, buddy.  You know, people like YOU are exactly the problem for whites.  Your defeatist mentality is far more destructive to us than untold hordes of hostile non-whites.  You absolutely forget the courageous history of our people in the face of dire circumstances than those we now face.  My goodness, Leonidas of Sparta, Scipio Africanus, Charles Martel, and the brave men at the Alamo would be laughing at you if they weren&rsquo;t busy turning in their graves.  </p>
<p>The system that now holds a dagger over our collective heart, will be a victim of it&rsquo;s own diversity, and crumble from ineptitude.  No dark horde, with it&rsquo;s inherent absence of implulse control, inability to cooperate within itself, and bestial irrationality, will EVER conquer white men once and for all.  You need to once again find your backbone, Pontificus.  Yes, white men are overly tolerant, long-suffering, preferred to diplomacy  &mdash;   but when we have to, we fight.  And we win.  EVERY time.  Always remember, &#8220;Lions bow lowest before they strike&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I was out on a road trip today and we went through several small towns out in rural areas and you&rsquo;d think those areas would be predominantly white. But they weren&rsquo;t. These areas had third worlders everywhere. So much for moving out to small towns. Would you rather have the convenience of Walmart nearby or 25 minutes away is what it&rsquo;s coming down to for me. There&rsquo;s not much difference anymore. No where to go.</p>

		<p>The White-hating hostile elite that runs the government will not rest until every White community is majority non-White and in ruins.</p>
<p>No White will be allowed to live in peace.</p>
<p>According to RefugeeResettlementWatch.com</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Medium size towns, such as Nashville,TN, Ft. Wayne, IN, Boise, ID and Manchester, NH, are serving as the main reception centers for the refugee program&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Also this:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;In FY 2010 the U.S. will take in 80,000 refugees plus at least 45,000 asylum seekers and so-called &#8216;Cuban-Haitian Entrants&rsquo; – all with the same rights and entitlements as refugees.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is committed to increasing the refugee quota, as was the Bush administration. </p>
<p> In recent years up to 95% of the refugees coming to the U.S. were referred by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or were the relatives of UN-picked refugees&hellip; the U.N. is effectively dictating much of U.S. immigration policy.　　</p>
<p> The leading refugee source countries for the U.S. program in recent years are, in order of admission numbers, Iraq, Burma, Bhutan, Iran and Somalia&hellip;The Muslim component decreased after 911, but today is back up to at least 40% and is set to rise from here&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Refugeeresettlementwatch.com is a wonderful site with great information  &mdash;  comment section is over-run by pro-immigration jerks spouting off garbage such as &#8216;This is a Nation of Refugees!&rsquo;, &#8216;Those who don&rsquo;t welcome refugees are hateful Nazis!&rsquo; (as they collect their fat refugee-resettlement fees from the USG and dump parasitic, low IQd, uneducated refugees on &#8216;rich&rsquo; White communities:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Refugee resettlement is profitable to the organizations involved in it. They receive money from the federal government for each refugee they bring over. They have almost no real responsibilities for these refugees. After four months the &rsquo; sponsoring&rsquo; organization is not even required to know where the refugee lives.</p>
<p>They are actually federal contractors and get the vast majority of their resources from the U.S. taxpayer.</p>
<p>The program is so lucrative that the Catholic Church has dropped traditional charity works to put more effort into resettlement. It uses collection offerings to promote the refugee resettlement program&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I would love nothing more than to see a White politician come forward and put an absolute end to this program.  Well, I can dream, can&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>I am convinced THE main purpose of these programs is to displace NATIVE BORN WHITE AMERICANS and destroy their living spaces (do I owe Jupiter royalties yet?).</p>

Yet the dollar continues to collapse (despite what the USG would like you to believe), unemployment is rampant with no end in site (despite what the USG tells you)  &mdash;  but bring in more parasitic refugees?  No problem. </p>

		<p>The change from majority minority rule will happen much sooner than 2050, Probably in two decades. Most of us will be probably gone by then or probbaly older or too old to care one way or another. The affect of this transformation will be felt mainly by the youth, which is why the system brainwashes them on 7/24 basis with diversity training, multi culturalism, white guilt and so on. If you want to know what the people in charge think of U.S, read the economist magazine issue in Feb about Immigration policy which calls   U.S &#8221; A great ponzy sheme&#8221;. That&rsquo;s how they see U.S a peace of real estate, not even as country with distinct culture and unique values!</p>

		<p>To poster #23.  I have seen the same thing.  Mexicans and others in the most out of the way places in middle America.  Who are giving them the jobs to enable them to work there?  Big agriculture!  The leaders of those companies need to be arrested for hiring illegals.  Ah, but what happened to the kosher meat plant investigation, dropped.</p>

		<p>It will be much easier to cleanse our smaller communities of Hispanics (mostly Mexicans) first since their demographic percentages are currently smaller. </p>
<p>Our ability to have enough children to maintain demographic superiority will never match Hispanic third-world overpopulation combined with our politician&rsquo;s push to import the overpopulated dregs of Hispaniola. </p>
<p>We are being invaded by colonizing aliens who are aided and abetted by traitors in our government and business.  </p>
<p>In the face of this threat real men do not act paralyzed and do nothing&hellip;</p>
