<h1><a href="http://cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=5251">Mayor Vetoes School Board Appointment</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Pratt, Commercial Dispatch (Columbus, Mississippi), March 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Starkville Mayor Parker Wiseman on Thursday vetoed the Board of Aldermen&rsquo;s appointment of Susan Tomlinson to the Starkville School District board.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with a heavy heart that I have decided to veto the appointment of Susan Tomlinson to the Starkville School Board,&#8221; Wiseman said in a statement. &#8220;{snip} Knowing her personally, knowing her credentials, and knowing her outstanding record of service to the schools, I have no doubt that Mrs. Tomlinson could serve the school district capably and well. However, having reviewed a deep field of uniquely qualified applicants and the current needs of the School Board, I do not feel that Mrs. Tomlinson is the best fit for the vacant position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiseman went on to say it is important for a policy-making body like the School Board to be &#8220;representative of the community&#8221; it serves.</p>
<p>The Starkville School District is 64 percent black, 32 percent white, 2 percent Asian, 1 percent Native American and 1 percent Hispanic. If Tomlinson, who is white, were to serve on the school board, the board would become 80 percent white and 20 percent black.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Starkville Board of Aldermen has the power to appoint four of the five members of the Starkville School Board,&#8221; Wiseman said. &#8220;As such, the Board of Aldermen bears the responsibility to ensure not only that appointees are qualified to serve, but also that the School Board is representative of the diverse community it serves. Diversity of representation should be considered as an important but not controlling factor in the process of appointing a school board member.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We do not hire on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, language, disability, or sexual orientation.  Except of course, in the case of People of Color, or certain ethnicities, non-Christian religions, handicaps, or gay-lesbian-transgender-proclivities.  Oh, also, there is no such thing as &#8220;race,&#8221; we are a post-racial, color-blind society, and all races are exactly equal, and racial diversity is our Greatest Strength.</p>
<p>Do you understand now?  Good!  Shut up and pay your taxes.  <br>

		<p>File a HUGE lawsuit. We all know that if a black were denied a job under similar circumstances, it would be a national story and we would never hear the end of it. Even after a multi million $$ settlement were announced. </p>
<p>When these situations crop up we need to sue the hell out of those denying Whites because of skin color. Then we need to sue them again. Until there is a severe penalty to pay ($$$) for discriminating against Whites, this will never end. </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve asked before, &#8220;Why should the percentage of Blacks in an area be the measuring stick for representation?&#8221; Since this is the school board, how about using as a measuring stick the percentage of Blacks with advanced degrees, or even the percentage of Blacks among high school graduates?</p>

		<p>Has anyone ever done a study of the achievements of the black race, independent of any other race? Achievements of blacks, by blacks, for blacks, that other races wanted to learn and emulate. </p>
<p>Any category. Science - Medicine - Architecture - Technology - Art<br>
Literature?  How about some classical African literature, written in a black language, translated so that the world could learn and appreciate the ways and wisdom of the black race. </p>

		<p>What a genius mayor.  Why doesn&rsquo;t he go and find a candidate whose only qualification is that their DNA is 64% African, 32% White, 2% Asian, 1% Native American and 1% Hispanic.  Maybe he could find someone like that at the local prison or mental institution; doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as he has the right racial background so they can &#8220;represent&#8221;. Whatever happened to being judged by the content of their character? Tomlinson should sue the idiots for racial discrimination.</p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m this lady I&rsquo;m happy as hell not to be working in a black ghetto school district. Here in Cleveland, they have so few whites who want to teach in dangerous neighborhood schools that they had to import a large community of Indians from Asia just to get them to teach. They don&rsquo;t have to pay them as much, because the union is almost non-existent, and they figure they can teach them the bare minimum English skills. But wait until they see that the vast majority of mixed kids, blacks and Hispanics rule the school with a heavy hand and violence. They will think that Mumbai wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. It&rsquo;s at least a homogenous society over there, even if you are born into a lower caste system. It&rsquo;s familiar territory. Over here (just like what our troops are facing in Iraq) it&rsquo;s tribal, and the street gangs hang with their own kind. Just like law enforcement. Mostly stick to their own color. What a novel idea.</p>

Comment: Now you&rsquo;ve gone and done it. Was this all just a set up so the minority faculty could shake down Sewanee? More money for themselves and jobs for their friends &#8220;of color&#8221;? Sure looks that way. Mccardell will give them everything. </p>
<p><br>
iReport  &mdash;  It&rsquo;s very dangerous what is happening in this University community, please spread this message.</p>
<p>copy of emails:</p>
<p>Dear Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>As a female faculty member of color I want to publicly express my outrageat the racist web sites/blogs and my continued disappointment in the University administration&rsquo;s lack of real efforts to address issues surrounding diversity and intolerance at Sewanee. Many students,particularly students of color, are currently experiencing great amounts of anxiety because of these insidious images. To my knowledge little is being done to ease the fears that many of them have shared with me. I also feel a great amount of unease for my children, my colleagues of color and myself. While I truly believe that the ideas and comments found on the web sites/blogs do not represent the Sewanee community, I am concerned that students are losing faith in their professors and administrators in making them feel wanted and safe. I urge every staff member and faculty that truly cares and is committed todiversity and social justice to put pressure of the administration to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Immediately hire more tenure-track faculty of color</p>
<p>2. Require that all students complete a social justice requirement</p>
<p>3. Add more courses to the curriculum that address culture and race in American society.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Kim Gallon</p>
<p>copy: </p>
<p>Dear Sewanee Community,</p>
<p>In response to the recent Internet hate blog targeting members of ourcommunity,let us stand in solidarity and with one voice affirm that the Sewanee community is welcoming, and that we do not tolerate injustice or prejudice of any kind.</p>
<p>Join us and come out to the School of Theology on Tuesday, March 30 at 12:15 pm for a walk to the Quad, adjacent to All Saints&rsquo; Chapel, for a time of prayer and a show of unity. </p>
<p>This is the link that has caused outrage:</p>

		<p>Maybe this should serve as a signal that whites should focus on the education of our own people. It&rsquo;s high time we stopped carrying other groups on our backs. What we&rsquo;ve done for others is never appreciated or acknowledged. Let all other groups not only educate their people but pay for it as well. Stop the subsidy of money and talent, charity begins at home. For all the resources poured down the hole we could have developed a higher level of capability for the white middle and lower economic classes.</p>

<p>Imagine what kind of a world we could leave for our children if we did not need to contribute ~ 20% of all of our resources (income, taxes, gov. spending) toward the maintenance and up-lift of tens of millions of people who generation after generation after generation fail to improve their lot, and continue to wreak ever-increasing levels of destruction on our civilization.  </p>
<p>Imagine if for the last 50 years, all that money spent improving Detroit and East St. Louis, and every other inner city, and closing the academic gap, had instead been spent on advanced education of gifted students, or on research for new technologies that could improve life and our economy.  Imagine being able to cut our police, prison, and judicial systems by 75%. Instead, again, this year, like all years before, we will fund cradle-to-grave care for tens of millions of evolutionary dead ends, who neither appreciate it, nor ever substantially improve.  <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time for blacks to stop making excuses for themselves. </p>
<p>In Los Angeles, if you drive through a black neighborhood like South Central or Watts, you&rsquo;ll find that just about every house has bars over the windows. Their not afraid of whitey breaking in. Blacks rob, kill, and prey on their own &#8220;bruthas&#8221; more than any other race.  70% of black fathers abandon their children. </p>
<p>The local hospital, Martin Luther King (name changed to King Drew Medical Center to avoid responsibility) is where all the affirmative action doctors and nurses go to work. It has been shut down five times because of the slovenly lack of standards. They actually let people die in the halls. Don&rsquo;t make me go there! </p>
<p>Affirmative action is a lie. And if black people had any REAL pride, they wouldn&rsquo;t take it. The sad irony is that affirmative action and other &#8220;set aside&#8221; quota programs cheat the minority of blacks who actually worked in school and earned their degrees. </p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t even funny anymore. blacks seem to always need HEP but they never give any, even to other blacks.<br>
They seem to have no problem in bleeding foolish whites of their hard earned money, but we brought this on ourselves.<br>
We wouldn&rsquo;t put up with this typical black behaviour if it were our own 4 year old child, but we allow these overgrown children to get away with just about anything (why not they are black aren&rsquo;t they?)Until white America tells these leeches Enough Is Enough they will keep doing what they do best, taking.<br>
Why are 99% of the charities that hep blacks, 99.5% white?</p>

		<p>I want whites to abandon public schools in favor of home schooling and private schools - it&rsquo;s critical for our survival to get our children away from the socialists and miscegenation-worshiping multiculturalists.  Therefore, the more frequently public schools openly discriminate against whites, the better&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think Mayor Wiseman is certainly wise to insist on black leadership for the school board.  After all, we can see for ourselves the clear benefits of black leadership throughout the world, from the stirring example of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Robert Mugabe in particular, to the explosive economic growth of all former European colonies in Africa since they gained their independence.  </p>
<p>And right here at home we have the inspiring example of major US cities with black mayoral leadership overseeing a veritable renaissance of building, prosperity, and job creation. They have brought peace and the rule of law where previously there was chaos and violence.  So yes, blacks should provide political leadeship for people of color. The record is clear!  </p>
