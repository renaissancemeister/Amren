<h1><a href="http://www.healthday.com/Article.asp?AID=637407">Black Women Least Likely to Breast-Feed in U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Reinberg, HealthDay Reporter, March 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Messages about the health-boosting powers of breast-feeding aren&rsquo;t reaching black American women as well as their Hispanic or white counterparts, a new study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests.</p>
<p>The researchers found that while more than 80 percent of Hispanic mothers attempt to breast-feed, and about 74 percent of white moms do, that number falls to 54 percent for black mothers. And one year after delivery, only about 12 percent of black women are still breast-feeding their child as recommended, compared to 24 percent of Hispanic women and more than 21 percent of white women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics have the highest rates of breast-feeding closely followed by whites and there tends to be a pretty big gap with blacks,&#8221; [Cria Perrine, one of the study&rsquo;s coauthors,] said.</p>
<p>The report is published in the March 26 issue of CDC&rsquo;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Breast-feeding among racial/ethnic groups also varied by state, particularly among black women, with the highest rates of breast-feeding among blacks seen in western states and the lowest in southeastern states, Perrine said.</p>
<p>The reasons for the disparities are not totally clear, Perrine said. &#8220;We definitely need more research in that area,&#8221; she noted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among Hispanics, breast-feeding is the cultural norm, Perrine noted. &#8220;In their countries of origin, breast-feeding is just the natural way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, after coming to the United States there is some loss of that tradition, with more Hispanic women favoring formula feeding, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Allow me to offer my own theory. Blacks see bottle feeding as more modern and more &#8220;acting white&#8221; than breast feeding, which they see as more primitive and more likely to be done in places like the &#8220;mother country&#8221; of Africa. That is why they shun it, despite the Afrocentric claims that Africa is the beacon of hope and light to all peoples of the world. Even blacks, deep down, don&rsquo;t buy it. This is also why blacks prefer to shop in white suburban retail districts rather than their own black communities. Wherever whites go, blacks want to follow.</p>

		<p>Why should they? WE pay for all the formula in the first place via: WIC and food stamps. Not to mention paying for the births of their kids and for most of their adult lives. Best they don&rsquo;t breast feed since many are on drugs and running around with another &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; to replace the last one.</p>

		<p>It has been well known for years that breast milk is far superior to the sugar water that passes for baby formula today. Breastfed babies are much healthier than bottle babies and is the right thing to do for infants/babies. Is anyone really surprised that black women bring up the rear in doing what is right for their babies?</p>

More research?</p>
<p>Would a $10 million grant to survey black women as to why they don&rsquo;t want or like to breast feed be enough?</p>
<p>After they collect the data, maybe they can come up with yet another socioeconomic theory to explain the differences thereby requiring a second $10 million grant to find solutions.<br>

		<p>Considering the diet most black women eat, the rates of STDs in their systems, their rates of drug and alcohol abuse, and generally unhealthy life styles then it seems that these women may be doing their babies a favor.  Isn&rsquo;t it bad enough they had to suffer from their mother&rsquo;s abusive lifestyle while in the womb?</p>
<p>Another problem with black women breast feeding is that they usually send their kids to their own mothers.  They start &#8220;par-tey-ing&#8221; as soon as they are up to it and are not likely to hang around the house nursing every two hours.  </p>

<p>Human breast milk is intended for the consumption of human babies. It contains everything that an infant needs to sustain life. Baby formula on the other hand is man&rsquo;s attempt to emulate breast milk. It generally contains cow&rsquo;s milk, which was intended to sustain a growing calf and is IMO, VERY unhealthy for humans. Formula also generally contains oil and a large amount of sweetner, usually sugar or corn syurp. Sometimes they contain flavor enhancers like msg. Throw in a host of minerals and vitamins (some synthetic) and you have man&rsquo;s version of human breast milk. A very poor subsititute IMO. </p>
<p>I can usually tell when a baby is breastfed and when they are a formula baby. The bottle babies are usually more cranky, sick more often and generally less happy than breastfed babies. </p>
<p>Sure women are exposed to some less than desirable elements in our environment. But the majority of our makeup and constitution is from things we ingest, like food and liquid, rather than things we are exposed to. Again, IMO, human breast milk is far superior to the sugar sweetened, oil and cow&rsquo;s milk mixture that IS baby formula. </p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t rocket science, 70 plus percent of blacks are born out of wedlock typically to teen or early twenty something girls who have little interest in raising them (the lack of fatherly involvement is a given). </p>
<p>The vast majority of these children are raised by their grandmothers who of course are not lactating (well usually not although you do see a lot of 30ish year old black &#8220;grannies&#8221; so maybe&hellip;)</p>

<p>Well allow me to offer my theory as a father.  Breastfeeding a baby is significantly harder than bottlefeeding it.  Just starting the process can be difficult and this is frustrating for the mom.  If you give the baby formula even for a little while, the baby will prefer it because it is sweeter and reject the breast.  The mother has to pump her breasts to store up breast milk in case the dad or the baby-sitter has to feed it.  Once the baby grows some teeth it can get painful for the mom.  I&rsquo;m guessing black women are just choosing the easier path.</p>
<p>Bottle feeding isn&rsquo;t exactly simple either.  You should boil the water before making the formula, then you have wait for it to cool before giving it to the baby.  This is frustrating if the baby is screaming.  If you put it in the fridge and forget about it, then you have to warm it up to at least room tempurature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just guessing here, but I&rsquo;d bet that a lot of black women just mix the formula with water right out of the tap and give it to the baby.  Since babies immune systems are not fully developed, this can be unhealthy.</p>

<p>Since, as you say, you&rsquo;re not a doctor, why are you contradicting medical advice when you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about?  You should know this is a very sensitive issue.  Mothers who breast feed typically are making an extraordinary sacrifice.  It is harder, personally, than anything I have ever done, including the bar exam.  For the first several weeks, you do not sleep for more than half an hour together.  By the time you fall asleep, its time to feed again.  If you have to go back to work, you have to pump milk every couple of hours for months.  You are out of line saying that mothers who make this sacrifice are harming their babies, as you have no evidence and no qualifications.</p>

		<p>This article and most of the commentators seem to be missing the obvious reason that Black women have such a low rate of breast feeding - you can&rsquo;t breast feed your baby when you&rsquo;re out at the club and the baby&rsquo;s with grandma. </p>
<p>Black women are more likely to pass off the baby to relatives for care than Whites or Hispanics since Black women are more often unwed when they have children. Without constant breastfeeding, a woman loses the ability to produce breast milk. Also, take into account Black women&rsquo;s low education and it&rsquo;s not likely they know or even care about the benefits of breastfeeding.</p>

		<p>Having two grown children who were breastfed, I can heartily second what John and Sofita wrote! It is much easier to open a can, mix it with some water and feed the child. With microwaves now, it takes what? 5 seconds to warm a bottle? In addition the bottle-feeding mother doesn&rsquo;t have to watch what she eats, refrain from chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and other more toxic smoking substances&hellip;<br>
Nursing your child to make sure s/he  gets the best possible start in life takes the ability to plan ahead, dedication, determination, willpower and support, all of which the majority of black mothers just do not have.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with you, because, hey, I really am just a Yahoo. But don&rsquo;t some of the products we are exposed to, in fish, pesticides, etc, don&rsquo;t some of them stay in the body for life, or for a very long time? Not certain these are entirely limited to what we eat and drink. Some one mentioned smoking was a bad idea for the breast-feeding mother. </p>
<p>For the other 2 posters&hellip; it really takes more work to put a baby up to your breast than it does for bottles of formula? Sorry, but I was having a hard time - it just occured to me, anyway, that maybe you were facetious, in part, in your post? </p>

		<p>Our children are now 20, 18, and 15, but I still remember my wife trying to breastfeed our first. It was very difficult for her at first, but it proved to be worthwhile after they (she and the baby) got the hang of it. It was also great for me because the only time I had to feed the baby was when my wife went back to work and she left me with frozen breast milk. Our kids have never had weight problems, as breast-fed kids tend to be a bit thinner than formula-fed babies. They also have been above-average students. Our oldest finished sixth in his high school class of 140, the next oldest was fourth in a similarly sized class, and our last is near the top of her class.</p>
<p>Elimination of subsidies for infant formula in WIC would reduce costs in the program, potentially reduce the incidence of obesity in adults, and maybe even improve the IQs of children. The effects may be small, but any improvement in those areas would be beneficial to the country as a whole when spread across the whole population. One only has to read &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; by Hernnstein and Murray to see that.</p>

		<p>And the factory-farm Cows whose milk is used in the &#8216;Formula&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t exposed to harmful chemicals and pollution?  </p>
<p>I have news.  Those cows most likely live, all their lives, on feed that contains antibiotics.  And as environments go, factory farms are roughly as healthy as crack-houses.  </p>
<p>Unless the mother is actively smoking &#8216;blunts&rsquo;, adding <br>
Vodka to her Orange Juice, and doing Meth, her milk cannot be worse than the milk from those poor cows.  And that&rsquo;s BEFORE one considers all the stabilizers and preservatives and flavor enhancers that may or may not be listed on the labels of the formula.</p>

This is very true, but when you factor in all the women who simply DO NOT KNOW HOW to nurse their child, (and it isn&rsquo;t  simply as easy as putting the child up to the breast  &mdash;  there are things like latching-on problems, weak suckling reflex, and myriad others), the mothers who CANNOT nurse their child due to lack of milk production, nipples that bleed, mothers with AIDS or HIV, and the congenitally stupid ones who WILL NOT breast feed, refusing formula would result in a whole lot of dead children, not only black babies, but white babies, too.  </p>

		<p>Human mothers&rsquo; milk was designed by evolution to be the best food for human infants; better than cow&rsquo;s milk (designed by evolution to be best for calves, not human babies) or infant formula.  Study after study have shown substantial health benefits to people who were breast-fed as infants.  The only real potential disadvantage to mother&rsquo;s milk lies in the fact that environmental contaminants are concentrated by a factor of ten for each step upward in the food chain one goes, so human mothers&rsquo; milk can safely be expected to have more heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, and so-on than milk from cattle (though with the antibiotics mentioned by Lauren above the reverse would be true).  This risk could to some extent be minimized by women avoiding foods like swordfish, tuna and shark - especially mako - (top predators in their own environment) while they are nursing, and not merely while they are actually pregnant.</p>

		<p>If Black women are least likely to breastfeed,it&rsquo;s probably because there&rsquo;s a government program that has been created to do that for them as well.<br>
Who knows,there is probably a government program that will send someone over to wipe your rear end at taxpayer expense if you look for it.</p>
