<p>Other black couples will be marking the eighth annual Black Marriage Day this weekend, by attending workshops, black-tie dinners and other activities. Some groups have held events throughout the month, although Black Marriage Day, which celebrates matrimony in the black community, falls on the fourth Sunday in March.</p>
<p>The founder estimates more than 300 celebrations are being held this weekend. The aim is to try to stabilize, if not reverse, the trend of non-commitment within the black community. Studies show blacks are less likely to marry than other ethnic groups and more likely to divorce and bear children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>Experts blame the disparities in part on high black male unemployment, high black male imprisonment and the moderate performance of black men in college compared with black women.</p>
<p>They also note the lack of positive images of black marriage in the media and several misperceptions about matrimony  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s for white people, that it&rsquo;s a ball and chain, that fatherhood and marriage are not linked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite those attitudes toward marriage, there are a handful of campaigns to get blacks to walk down the aisle, from the federal government&rsquo;s African American Healthy Marriage Initiative to Marry Your Baby Daddy Day, with 10 unwed couples with children tying the knot later this year in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;You Saved Me,&#8221; a documentary that explores the marriages of eight black couples, will be screened in more than 20 cities this weekend as part of a Black Marriage Day premiere.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black Marriage Day founder Nisa Islam Muhammad is encouraging couples to renew their vows in front of friends and family in honor of Tyler Perry&rsquo;s movie &#8220;Why Did I Get Married Too?&#8221; which opens April 2.</p>
<p>Muhammad points out that many black children come from single-parent households and contends that the media are not helping. There&rsquo;s never been a black &#8220;Bachelor&#8221; on the popular TV show, and the star of the 2008 movie &#8220;27 Dresses,&#8221; about a 27-time bridesmaid, was white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most blacks already think that marriage is a good thing, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. But many can&rsquo;t find anyone they think would make a good spouse.</p>

<p>What if she has more than one child from more than one man?  She can&rsquo;t marry them all.  And if she marries one of them, she&rsquo;s putting the children not by that particular man at risk, because almost every domestic infanticide is at the hands of a man in a close relationship with the baby&rsquo;s mother that isn&rsquo;t the victim&rsquo;s father.  Also at risk will be the adolescent sons of said mother who aren&rsquo;t that man&rsquo;s children, because the new man leans on the mother to kick them out of the house.</p>
<p>Both are shades of what happens in the leonite realm, when a new male takes over a pride:  Kills the young cubs that aren&rsquo;t his, and ejects maturing adolescents.  The first is self-serving, so that he can get with the females to procreate for himself (the young cubs distract their mother&rsquo;s attention), and the latter is also self-serving, to eliminate any competition for pride leadership.  Humans also display these characteristics, criminal or uncouth as it is, and some humans more than others.</p>

<p>Right.  It&rsquo;s all due to:</p>
<p>1: <i>Unemployment&hellip;&gt;/i&gt;</i></p>
<p>&hellip;but why are so many blacks unemployed? </p>
<p>2: <i>Prison&hellip;</i></p>
<p>And how do blacks get <i>into</i> prison?  Generally by committing crimes, I think.</p>
<p>3:  <i>Moderate</i> [read: poor] <i>performance of black men in college</i> </p>
<p>This is a joke.  What percentage of blacks even graduate from high school?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;They also note the lack of positive images of black marriage in the media&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Oh, of course!  It&rsquo;s the <i>media&rsquo;s</i> fault for not showing those poor, misguided blacks how to get married!  Odd, though, how Whites and Orientals don&rsquo;t seem to need such instructional materials.</p>
<p>And while we&rsquo;re on the topic, how come White complaints about the negative influence of the media are always brushed aside as paranoid delusions, while the very same media are now authoritatively cited as the cause of black promiscuity? </p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;and several misperceptions about matrimony &mdash; that it&rsquo;s for white people&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That seems to be observably true.  Whose &#8220;misperceptions&#8221; are these?</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;&hellip;that it&rsquo;s a ball and chain&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation: that <i>responsibility</i> is involved.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;that fatherhood and marriage are not linked.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In the black world, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Frankly, I see no compelling evidence that most blacks even understand the link between <i>sex</i> and fatherhood.</p>
<p>All in all, we have the standard litany: blacks behave irresponsibly, but it&rsquo;s not their fault.  It&rsquo;s <i>never</i> their fault.  It <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be their fault.  And all that&rsquo;s necessary is to hold a &#8220;black marriage day&#8221; to make every black household the very image of <i>Father Knows Best.</i><br>

		<p>Before the mass migration of blacks to the North 50-75 years ago, the majority of blacks in the south got married and had stable families.  The problem is when you take males out of a rigid social environment and give them free reign - they go nuts.  That&rsquo;s why young men in war situations do terrible things.  There&rsquo;s no one around to stop them.</p>

<p>Albert Schweitzer was right. Blacks are children. Even their slang is childish. Is it just me, but doesn&rsquo;t the phrase &#8220;baby daddy&#8221; sounds like something you&rsquo;d say to a, well, baby?</p>

		<p>I would hate to be in that registrars office during the nuptials!  I have personally witnessed black women fighting over &#8220;they man, i.e. some jail bird hoodlum who has provided these women with nothing but sperm.  But boy, will they battle over him.  And since most black men have multiple children by multiple women, deciding who the lucky girl will be could be catastrophic.<br>

<p>I see another, more sinister possibility here in that this arrangement is being conducted by a Muslim and probably involving converting to Islam in some form or another which also means, future domestic terrorists. For the usual reasons, blacks are attracted to those parts of the Muslim ideology which allow for unfettered violence against non Muslims (which  blacks interpret as Whites) with no thought to the fact that the real Muslims in Saudi and Kuwait are Caucasian and hate blacks.</p>

<p>Saudis are Arabs. Arabs are not white. Yes, there are white Muslims in around the world and even Caucasian ones. I think Americans have much more wider definition of who&rsquo;s black and who&rsquo;s white. For us Europeans we see distinctions that most Americans would not see. This is every true in Scandinavia. </p>
<p>A couple days ago I was out celebrating a past exam at my Master program with some of my fellow course mates. We were of course all &#8220;Swedes&#8221; - but one girl look a little different from us. Not much, but slightly. It came to me that she was Jewish and from Poland or Russia I asked her. I also noted her last name, which was Jewish, but I have been thinking this since the very beginning of the course, because she had the same Jewish attributes as my former girlfriend. Everything was true, but it was only her grandfather, she told me. Genetically assimilation takes time. Even though she said that she did not define herself as Jewish and Russian, she was aware of this. </p>
<p>Her children&rsquo;s children will likely disappear and just a small portion of her &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; and Russian will live through her. This is unviable. </p>
<p>You are very true that Arabs are racists in many ways. They dislike blacks so much that they just took male slaves and then sterilized them. Turks (which are not Arabs) did almost the same thing with their black slaves. Still, there is a little black Turkish community. </p>
<p>Many here argue against &ldquo;race-mixing&rdquo;. I think it can be done if it is done in a small scale and there follows a cultural assimilation. Sadly, this have even become impossible in Scandinavia – because we have no so many people from the third world that they choose to mix with themselves and not with us.  Swedes are now very racially aware, even though race is a Taboo word here. Instead we talk about culture and it&rsquo;s the culture or ethnicity.  </p>
<p>Again, Scandinavia is a really strange place right now. We have a population of nine million. In 1975 Sweden was pretty much ethnically homogeneous – now we take in about 100 000 refugees every year. We have now over 20 percent non-whites in the country.  When you have racial issues, we have cultural issues besides the racial issue. This is true all over Europe.  Sad as it is.. </p>

		<p>Like everything with black people, there has to be an element of nonsense in it or they aren&rsquo;t able to understand it. Even such a serious matter as getting married has to be made into some form of entertainment.</p>
<p>I remember reading in the slave narratives (1930s interviews of former slaves - Federal writers workshop, a depression era attempt at giving people some work) how the slave owners would have a &#8220;Holiday&#8221; so the slaves could go through the motions of getting &#8220;married,&#8221; and have a party.</p>

		<p>SKIP- You are correct sir! Tell &#8216;em what he&rsquo;s won. Well, nothing in terms of tangible materialistic prizes, but you have something much more valuable than any right or left-winger could dream of having. You have an understanding of the truth. I totally agree 100%. Blacks who claim to be Muslim only do so because they are attracted to the carnage and bloodshed, but try to tell the blacks to fast during Ramadan and tell them to abstain from alcohol and drugs, or pork ribs, and you&rsquo;ll have a fight on your hands. That is why they are despised by Arabs and Asian, and even white Muslims. Because they lack self-control. Evolution has not caught up to them, and it&rsquo;s unlikely it will in the next 300 or so years. What would they do if a white guy converted to Islam and joined a mosque, and surrounded himself with blacks? The blacks would then turn on their &#8220;principles&#8221; of putting other Muslims first, and say they robbed the white Muslim or beat up the white Muslim because he was&hellip; wait for it&hellip; here it comes&hellip; white. </p>

		<p>Question Diversity makes an astute observation, comparing black conduct to lion behavior&hellip;I would also like to point out that just as lions urinate on shrubs and leave claw marks on trees to mark their territory, urban blacks do the same by tagging and defacing surfaces in their hood with spray paint. It&rsquo;s an African thing&hellip;. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is too much of this kind of infanticide among lower class whites.  Pay attention to the TV news.  Whenever an infant child is either murdered or beaten so badly that it&rsquo;s a miracle that s/he survived, it&rsquo;s almost entirely at the hands of the mother&rsquo;s new boyfriend that is not the baby&rsquo;s father.  </p>
<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger (yes, that Dr. Laura) says that the rate of infanticide is 60 times higher in stepfamilies than it is in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ones.</p>
<p>As for the other part, that behavior also shows up in humans, but as far as that goes, blacks are way way way more likely to display it than whites.  Several years ago, the school district that serves an inner ring suburb of St. Louis that had &#8220;transitioned&#8221; long ago to almost entirely low-class white to almost all black (in terms of its school age population) opened up a special home for jettisoned teenage boys.  The home is funded partially by the district and partially by private donations.  Other districts in the St. Louis area, (ones that happen to be heavily black, as a matter of coincidence), asked this district for guidance because they needed to set up similar homes in their own areas.  </p>
<p>The local media admitted that the reason these teenage boys were homeless is because their mothers threw them out at the insistence of the mother&rsquo;s new live-in boyfriend.  With blacks, the situation is apropos, because a 14-year old teenage boy probably has a mother who is around 30, and therefore her new &#8220;boo&#8221; is also around 30, and 30- and 14-year old typical black guys are pretty similar in a lot of ways.  So a 30-year old black man views a 14-year old black teenage boy as far more of an equal than does the same dichotomy among whites.  </p>

Blacks are shown to be smart, stably married, prosperous, caring, and all together far more well-adjusted than whites are.  Hollywood would not dare show anything else. </p>

<p>Animals typically kill the very young offspring of rival males to bring the females into heat faster and spread their own genes. Seems like with human males they frequently kill 5 and 6 year old children that are not really a threat as the mother is already accepting new partners again. I think maybe it is also because kids can be very annoying and the bonding hormones just aren&rsquo;t there to inhibit violence and abandonment.</p>
<p>I worked with a black woman that casually mentioned (as if she was discussing the weather) that one of her lovers once beat her 5 year old daughter to death. He was a drug addict (she did not know this) and she left the daughter with him all day when she worked. She directed her anger at the JUDGE instead of at herself or at the killer. She seemed to feel no personal responsibility even though this same man had once choked HER nearly to death in a rage, she seemed to think her kid getting beat to death was a freak occurance sort of like being struck by lightening.</p>

<p>I used to work in an Italian takeaway food place and now I work with a fellow from Egypt (a Christian, as an aside) and the differences between these two chaps is very slight. They are very similar in looks and even have a similar sense of humour.<br>
Apart from the fact that one had a long complicated Italian surname (that I can&rsquo;t recall) and the other&rsquo;s surname is &#8216;Ibrahim&rsquo; you&rsquo;d be flat out being able to tell the difference.</p>

<p>Most young men in war DON&rsquo;T do &#8220;terrible things&#8221;. It has nothing to do with no one being around to stop them. They are the products of their parental training or lack thereof. </p>
<p>I believe that it was Douglas MacArthur who issued a direct warning to the troops occupying Japan that any abuse of civilians, sexual or otherwise, would produce severe consequences including execution.</p>
<p>In the last few years there have been several cases of rape of young Japanese girls on Okinawa. The perpetrators were mostly Afros just as they are here.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to sound like the Church Lady, but shouldn&rsquo;t these women get married first before they have a child with a man? And since they often have multiple sex partners resulting in a house full of little half-brothers and half-sisters, which man do they choose? The first one who knocked them up? Or the last? Or someone in between? Do they write the names of their children&rsquo;s fathers (if they know the names and if they can write) on separate pieces of paper, fold them up, and then randomly choose a name, kind of like a lottery, and that is how they decide which man to marry? And what if he says no because a bunch of other women have also had children with him? I think I see a solution to this and it called an orphanage.</p>

		<p>A social conundrum exists in western society today; one that is based on two opposing axioms.</p>
<p>1. Blacks and Browns cause irreparable harm to civilized, White societies. The problem exists in the collective intelligence, behavior, and outcomes associated with Blacks and Browns. They take from society far more than they return. As proof, no one can name a single Black or Brown society where standards exceed those found in White societies. In fact, there usually are few or no standards in Black and Brown societies.</p>
<p>2. Western Governments and Businesses are highly dependent on the very needy, poor, unintelligent, and irresponsible people (e.g., Blacks and Browns).</p>
<p>See the paradox? Blacks and Browns harm society; yet, governments and businesses need Blacks and Browns! </p>
<p>Think of it this way: The needier and less intelligent the people are, the stronger the government becomes! Which groups are the neediest and least intelligent? Blacks and Browns!</p>
<p>The &#8220;missing link&#8221; in all of this is you and me   &mdash;   responsible, intelligent, White people.<br>
 <br>
Governments and the most elite White business owners force us to transfer our wealth, via the Blacks and Browns, back to them, all in the name of equality, civil rights, human rights, affirmative action, etc.</p>
<p>My God, when will people wake up and see what is happening?</p>
<p>The RNC and DNC are two sides of the same coin; one that is destroying our way of life!<br>

		<p>#16  -  I work with quite a few Arabs and no, they do not look like southern Italians or Greeks.  They may be racially Caucasian but they certainly do not look European, even southern European.  And I am neither Italian/Greek or Arab.</p>

		<p>MOST black mothers have absolutely no idea who the father of there baby is. I have seen TV shows where the black female is 1000% sure (as they say) and yet number 14 who was just DNA tested proves to be without guilt.<br>
It seems that in the world of the black any female of any race or any color is fair game and if no female is available ask some black what Getting It On The Down Low means. It means as Woody Allen has said &#8221; Never being without a date on a Saturday night&#8221;</p>

		<p>We need more stuff like this. Almost half of black adults have never been married, and 70% of black children were born out of wedlock. We need to fix the black family immediately or we&rsquo;ll have another generation of lost blacks. </p>
<p>Most black women I know still have romantic relationships with their baby daddy, why not just get married?</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a myth that black women have multiple baby daddies. That&rsquo;s not true, the average black women today has 2 children by the same man. But like whites women, black women are having less and less children. A lot of professional black women have no children at all. We need to multiply to stay powerful. </p>

		<p>Out of curiousity, and I am fairly positive quite a few members of AmRen have been wondering about it as well.  I searched for and found the largest facebook group regarding interracial relationships.  It was the biggest, most active group I could find after I typed in &#8220;interracial&#8221; on facebook.  It has more than twenty thousand members.  The rest of facebook groups on interracial relationships usually had 4000~10000 members.  Some of the members of the particular facebook group posted pictures of them and their loved ones.  (look at the head photo)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=111295120943&amp;view=all" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=111295120943&view;=all</a></p>
<p>You can click on the picture to move onto the next picture.  It works like an easy slideshow, and the photo album does not require the viewer to be logged onto facebook to view the pictures.  </p>
<p>The following are the trends I noticed from the photo album of the facebook group.</p>
<p>1. Most people in the pictures of the facebook group appeared to be between the age of 20~30.  From the photo album, I saw very few pictures where they seemed to be below 20 or over 40.  (but I agree that&rsquo;s partly because most facebook users are between the age of mid teens to mid thirties)</p>
<p>2. Black women are the group that is most likely to be involved in interracial relationships.  I think roughly 70% of all the pictures of that facebook group included a black female or half black female.  </p>
<p>3. Hispanic men come in 2nd.</p>
<p>4. Obese white women come in 3rd.</p>
<p>5. White men come in 4th&hellip;  tied with black men.  </p>
<p>4. Normal white women, Hispanic women, and Asian women only constitute a small part of the entire group.  (In short, non-black women).</p>
<p>5. I saw basically zero East Asian male in the entire photo album of the facebook group.     <br>
 <br>
6. There were many more pictures of white men/black women or white men/hispanic women than there were pictures of white men/Asian women.  </p>
<p>Please keep in mind, facebook is most freqently used by people between the age of mid-teens to mid-thirties.  it is the most popular social networking site among white people and college students, and myspace is the most popular social networking site for blacks, bands and other types of musicians.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;the difference between these chaps is very slight. They are very similar in looks and even have a similar sense of humour.<br>
Apart from the fact that one had an&hellip; Italian surname, and the other&rsquo;s surname is &lsquo;Ibrahim&rsquo; you&rsquo;d be [unable] to tell the difference.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
They are both Mediterraneans. For many centuries, they shared the &#8216;Mare Nostrum&rsquo;, the Roman lake, at a time when sea travel was more important than land, and water was a unifier while land was a divider.  Nor are all Egyptians racially the same! There are Mediterranean Egyptians, and further south, there are black Nubian Egyptians.</p>
<p>Incidentally, though, true Egyptians were and are not Arabs. The Arabs were conquerors from Arabia, the new rulers, and it took centuries for Egypt to get Arabized.  Nowadays, a vast swath of peoples like to think they are &#8220;Arabs&#8221;. (As if speaking Arabic makes you Arab.)  It would be like Peruvians and Guatemalans claiming to be Spaniards.  </p>
<p>There is so much confusion about ethnicity!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Some groups have held events throughout the month, although Black Marriage Day falls on the fourth Sunday in March.&#8221;<br>
___   ___   ___   ___   </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see now. Black Marriage is &#8220;celebrated&#8221; throughout March.  Black History month is all February. Martin Luther King is celebrated in January. That&rsquo;s already 3 months of black celebration   &mdash;   one quarter of the whole year!   And they complain that they are overlooked and neglected. What more do blacks want? </p>
<p>Do whites have even one such &#8220;white&#8221; holiday? Does anyone celebrate &#8220;white&#8221;  anything???  The very suggestion would be viewed with horror. Intolerable! It would be considered racist!</p>
<p>Question then:  How have these &#8220;minorities&#8221; come to be placed on a pedestal and made more important than the majority?  Who has skewed these things and placed the cart before the horse?  <br>

		<p>&#8220;When you have racial issues, we have cultural issues besides the racial issue. This is true all over Europe. Sad as it is..&#8221;</p>
<p>   I think, over time, that you will discover that they are one and the same thing. You can&rsquo;t have traditional Swedish culture when your people are no longer racially Swedish. We are finding this out in America, where traditional American (European) culture is being co-opted by non whites. Our entire history is being re-written to marginalize white achievement. </p>

		<p>Most young men in war DON&rsquo;T do &ldquo;terrible things&rdquo;. It has nothing to do with no one being around to stop them. They are the products of their parental training or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Children in our society today are getting the bulk of their &#8220;parental&#8221; training from the TV set, government schools, pop music, and long, unsupervised hours with their peer group.  This is why we lose most of the children.  Those who control the first three win their hearts and minds.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
I would consider them white. Certainly the one in the foreground. Absolutely!  I&rsquo;m not one of those who imagine that you have to be blond to be white. Nor even European.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of disagreement on this site about who or what is &#8220;white&#8221;.  No one seems very sure.  I may have a more relaxed definition of the term than most.</p>
<p>But in this case, I don&rsquo;t even have to stretch it. That fellow is white. </p>
