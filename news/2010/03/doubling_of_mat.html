<h1>Doubling of Maternal Deaths in US &#8216;Scandalous,&rsquo; Rights Group Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Smith, CNN, March 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deaths from pregnancy and childbirth in the United States have doubled in the past 20 years, a development that a human rights group called &#8220;scandalous and disgraceful&#8221; Friday.</p>
<p>In addition, the rights group said, about 1.7 million women a year, one-third of pregnant women in the United States, suffer from pregnancy-related complications.</p>
<p>Most of the deaths and complications occur among minorities and women living in poverty, it noted.</p>
<p>Amnesty International issued a report Friday that calls on President Obama to take action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA,&#8221; notes that the lifetime risk of maternal deaths is greater in the United States than in 40 other countries, including virtually all industrialized nations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Minorities, women living in poverty, Native Americans, immigrants and those who speak little or no English are particularly affected, Amnesty International said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that really struck us was that these problems hit women of color, low-income, particularly hard,&#8221; said Nan Strauss, researcher and co-author of the Amnesty report. &#8220;But every woman who is going through pregnancy in this country is at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Figures compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, show that black women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>White women have a mortality rate of 9.5 per 100,000 pregnancies, the CDC said. For African-American women, that rate is 32.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been known for a while and no one has a good handle on it,&#8221; said Dr. Elliot Main, chairman and chief of obstetrics at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. &#8220;This is a national disgrace and a call to action. Both numbers are a call to action  &mdash;  maternal mortality and racial disparity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CDC analysis shows that deaths during pregnancy and childbirth have doubled for all U.S. women in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>In 1987, there were 6.6 deaths for every 100,000 pregnancies. The number of deaths had climbed to 13.3 per 100,000 in 2006, the last year for which figures were available.</p>

		<p>If a higher percentage of black women die from childbirth over white women, then the biggest factor for the difference is drug addiction.</p>

		<p>Women living in poverty should not be creating more mouths to feed in the first place and the fact that so many will do this is what is scandalous and disgraceful. Poverty is their lifestyle choice and I say let them enjoy it then.</p>

The numbers alone mean little.  You&rsquo;d have to compare not only death rates but also rates of alcoholism and drug abuse, rates of preventive measures during pregnancy and even rates of murder and accidents during pregnancy.  Women who take drugs and don&rsquo;t even go for free medical services are far more likely to die during pregnancy than their more responsible peers.  They are also more likely to die from wandering drunkenly in front of cars or from provoking their ex-con boyfriends into attacks.  To compare only the death rates and draw any conclusions whatsoever is false framing.  To look at such figures and cry discrimination is the fallacy of the single cause.  </p>

		<p>It is also true that  Tuberculosis has returned over the last 20 years significantly, when we had NO cases and had conquered that disease.<br>
It is also true that polio and other diseases have re-appeared after we had eradicated them from our national body of health.<br>
It is also true that miscarriages are on the rise.  Child molestation is on the rise.  Infant death is on the rise.  <br>
ALL these are linked.  The reason can be given in two words.  Third Worlders.  We USED to have relatively secure borders and a policy of NOT allowing anybody to enter the country who carried a communicable disease or had other health issues.  Now we have wide open borders without enforcement, allow legal immigrants to enter the country with virtually ANY health issue to include AIDS, and we treat them for free in our ER&rsquo;s.  What did we expect?  A decrease?  The outrage isn&rsquo;t the statistics themselves.  THE OUTRAGE IS THAT WE ARE LETTING THESE DISEASED AND IGNORANT THIRD WORLDERS INTO OUR COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>

		<p>Well, if the &#8220;women of color&#8221; had sense enough to eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, plus beans &amp; rice if they can&rsquo;t afford meat - they&rsquo;d be properly nourished and have a much better chance of surviving their pregnancies.  Too many of &#8216;em don&rsquo;t want to cook, and would cheerfully die before eating a raw salad with vinegar and oil dressing.  And it isn&rsquo;t as though the healthy foods aren&rsquo;t available - they ARE, and they&rsquo;re cheap too, at least here in SoCA.  I say it&rsquo;s just plain laziness, along with a fancy for crack, crank and alcohol.  </p>

So true, Bill. But let&rsquo;s look at your words, and find out why no Liberal (50% of this ailing nation), or any Marxist (20-30%), or most spineless jellyfish otherwise not Marxist (20-40%)(overlapping/concurrent groups) could not get your message, and/or would condemn you and reject the message. <br>
Here&rsquo;s the list of banned words, Komrade!</p>
<p>1) OUTRAGE: You&rsquo;re obviously a nut(or maybe you&rsquo;re just awake; either way, you&rsquo;re not nice.</p>
<p>2) WE: What &#8220;WE.&#8221; There is no &#8220;WE,&#8221; Komrade. This is a nation of many colors. America (sorry, The United States) is not white, and &#8216;we&rsquo; assume you&rsquo;re white, well, because. Only white men would spew this hate.</p>
<p>3) THESE: It just sounds like you&rsquo;re using words to demean these&hellip;oops, um, those&hellip;oops..I mean (well, there must be SOME word that sounds better. You&rsquo;re a bad, bad man.</p>
<p>4)DISEASED: You can&rsquo;t rightfully say that these (argh!!!, I can&rsquo;t stop using the &#8220;T&#8221; word!!!) people are somehow more unclean or less deserving, because of their country of origin. Whites get sick, too, and it&rsquo;s largely the fault of Colonialism&hellip;er, the VESTIGES of colonialism&hellip;and SLAVERY&hellip;and, the lack of FAIR TRADE&hellip;that..er make these AHHHGGG! My ears are burning and my tounge is on fire, I said the &#8220;T&#8221; word again, arghhh!&hellip;uh, could we just move on? Next forbidden word!</p>
<p>5) IGNORANT: This just proves that you, sir are ignorant! ( I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin with this outrage). Oops, I said the &#8220;O&#8221; word. I mean, I just can&rsquo;t fathom how you could have such a limited view of the world. If there is any logic to your thinking, I am unaware of it.  Next word!</p>
<p>6) THIRD WORLD: Please, Sting already told us, &#8220;One world is enough for all of us.&#8221; You are divisive. People like you are the problem. You keep singling out others and blaming them.</p>
<p>7) OUR: Just who are you talking about? This land was once Indian..I mean &#8220;Native&#8221; American. If anybody gets to say this is &#8220;our&#8221; land, it is the Indi&hellip;&#8221;American Natives.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8221; stole this land from them. And that invasion, that theft of land and culture cannot be wiped clean. We took away the Ind&hellip;American..Aboriginal&rsquo;s way of life. That is the travesty here. Your use of this &#8220;our&#8221; word seems to suggest that foreigners&hellip;I mean, people from other&hellip;cultures&hellip;are not legitimate here. Let me tell you, NO ONE IS ILLEGAL! Besides, white Europeans were the first Illegal Aliens. You&rsquo;re so mixed up. </p>
<p>All right, Mr. Bill R. Here are the  words which you can use in public discourse re: immigration and citizens of the world:</p>
<p>The,Is,That,Are,And,Into,Country (under review for final approval),In, First (Use highly discouraged), and Place.</p>
<p>In the future, you can enter the marketplace of ideas with these more reasonable terms.</p>

<p>The &#8220;quick action&#8221; I&rsquo;d like to see is ICE deport these pregnant illegals so we don&rsquo;t have to pay their medical bills. That&rsquo;s the only disgrace I see.</p>

		<p>I never like to hear about any women or children in distress, whatever the race.  I just think that if we didn&rsquo;t import this problem, then it would not be our problem.  </p>
<p>I wonder if the do-gooders are prepared for a huge tax hike on their paychecks to tackle this problem, and further, just when they see progress, what will they do when another ten million illegals flood in and swamp any glimmer of progress from being made.  This has been the problem with the social justice movement.  They say it is the right of the third world to move to America, yet when the quality of life declines here, they want to bring more of the third world here.  It is a cycle that trends us ever downwards.</p>

		<p>Congratulations to Eurowhite women for having the intelligence to handle their pregnancy so well. I&rsquo;m sure that if CNN had measures of Asian women pregnancies given their comparable intelligence, that a correlating success rate would be evident as well. </p>
