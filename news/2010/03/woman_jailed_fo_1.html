<h1>Woman Jailed For Asking &#8216;Why&rsquo; Files Suit Against APD, Officers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rhonda Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman jailed for 10 hours after she challenged the authority of a policeman has filed suit in federal court against the officers and the Atlanta Police Department, claiming they violated her civil rights, used excessive force on her and subjected her to emotional distress.</p>
<p>The suit said the officers were acting &#8220;upon racial prejudices accumulated and fostered&#8221; by APD when they arrested Minnie Carey, who was 61 at the time, for disorderly conduct after she asked &#8220;why&#8221; she had to move from where she was standing on a sidewalk talking to friends.</p>
<p>The suit says the officers&rsquo; agenda in ordering her to move and the arresting her was to &#8220;demonstrate power and control and [to] strike fear into citizens of this low income, predominately black neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Carey, now 62, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Officer Brandy Dolson and his partner drove up in their patrol car and told the women to move. Carey&rsquo;s friends walked off, but she didn&rsquo;t. Instead, Carey asked &#8220;why&#8221; and Dolson responded, &#8220;because I said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey said she was then handcuffed and taken to the Atlanta jail on a charge of disorderly conduct. She was kept in jail almost 10 hours, according to the suit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Citizen Review Board, which investigates allegations of Atlanta police misconduct, already has found that Dolson acted improperly in the incident. Board members put off recommending a punishment until they have reviewed details of previous citizen complaints against Dolson.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Atlanta police have been known to target and abuse blacks, without reason, in this low income neighborhood, resulting in extreme fear of the police by its residents,&#8221; the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Dolson and his partner  &mdash;  Jamie Nelson, who also is named in the suit  &mdash;  are African-American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, the lawsuit says, the city does not discourage street officers from targeting the poor or minorities, and APD does not give officers proper training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suit said the officers violated Carey&rsquo;s Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure, denied her liberty and violated her right to be free from racial discrimination.</p>

Typical cop thugs.  Cops can do this.  If a cop tells you to do something, and you don&rsquo;t do it.  He can arrest you.  But most cops will not do this to a woman in her 60s.  Kind of looks&hellip;. embarrassing.  Looks like the thug cop mentality ran into the loud black woman mentality.  Federal suit will come to nothing.  Cops will skate, but only because they are black.</p>

		<p>Black radical groups are always complaining about the &#8220;racism&#8221; of white cops.  They better be careful what they wish for, because black cops are way more abusive and corrupt (generally speaking), and can often be as &#8220;racist&#8221; (i.e. none too fond of blacks) as white cops.</p>

		<p>What I see here is an extremely immature woman acting like an 11-year-old child.</p>
<p>Some children don&rsquo;t like taking orders from adults, so they indignantly refuse to comply.</p>
<p>This woman reacted in the same way. An authority told her to do something. Like a child, she doesn&rsquo;t like take orders from authority and indignantly refused to comply. Of course, there were consequences to her petulant actions. She can&rsquo;t handle the consequences of her childish misbehavior, so she files a law suit, alleging &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article didn&rsquo;t mention whether or not the police officer involved made any reference to her race, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that he did, which makes it illogical to say this is a racial incident. More likely it&rsquo;s just a case of a black woman being stupid.</p>

		<p>This is a tough call and NOT because the cops were black but because cops are very frequently arrogant and love the power they hold over others.  On the other hand black woman are known to be loud, rude and obnoxious.  A bad situation.  Had the cops been white there probably would have been no arrest because a white cop must fear racial discrimination charges more than a black cop.</p>
<p>In this day and age there is no reason why every patrol car can not be equipped with a video camera recording every officers shift..  In fact a roof mounted camera with four lenses recording (on hard drive) everything that goes on front, back and both sides would be easy enough to implement.  The recordings could be saved for say 90-180 days.  Then if someone cried foul the police, plaintiff, attorneys and a judge could view (and hear) the events and decide whether or not to proceed with the complaint.  Indisputable proof of who the trouble makers are, whether they be police or citizen.<br/>

There are cameras available that can record several hours of video on a device the size of an ink pen inserted into a shirt pocket. I suggest that we all start thinking of using such devices any time we are in &#8220;enemy territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.  The main reason us whites who live in diverse areas need to have these a/v recording devices on us is that if you get into a conflagration with a non-white, s/he will use the excuse that you called him or her a racial slur.  The recording will show them to be the liars they typically are.  </p>

<p>I suspect it was more a case of a loud black woman acting as she usually does, stOOOOOOpidly, and probably accompanied by the usual head bobbing and finger wagging in the officer&rsquo;s face. And of course, there is this jewel of info &#8221; until they have reviewed details of previous citizen complaints against Dolson&#8221; apparently even the local BLACK citizens have complained about this woman&hellip;.clearly a case of ghetto lottery effort.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  A rare incident where I AGREE with the black person making such a complaint.  Missed by most people is the fact that it is black officers engaged in such behavior.  This woman is RIGHT.  And it&rsquo;s important to understand WHY this behavior is going on.</p>
<p>I would also propose that had the officers been white, they would not have done anything except politely asked the woman to move and patiently explained why.  If there was no good reason for her to move, they would not even have asked.<br/>

<p>Sorry Skip, Dolson is one of the male police officers named in the suit. <br/>
Ms. Carey *may* be one of the loud, angry black women we typically see, but she, like everyone else, has the right to &#8220;freely assemble&#8221; and stand on a public street corner chatting with a couple of friends. If this is the whole story, the officers DID act unreasonably, first in ordering the elderly ladies to move, and secondly by arresting Carey. <br/>
Anon is correct, first blacks, and very shortly whites as well, and how long do you think it will be before it is ONLY whites who have no right to speak to each other in public?</p>

		<p>In most locales, disorderly conduct is any action that causes fear or alarm in another person.</p>
<p>This woman would not have feared being arrested for disorderly conduct in Chicago.</p>
<p>The Chi cops, by policy, by a letter notifying each and every policeman, were told: &#8220;on duty, a Chi policeman is not allowed to become afraid or alarmed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Standing in one place and asking &#8220;why?&#8221; is not an action? I am not a legal expert.</p>

<p>That is true, as I have seen personally many times (allowing, of course, for exceptions).  Blacks can be very hard on other blacks, knowing they are exempt from racial allegations that would surely be directed at a white cop and which could ruin a white cop&rsquo;s career.  Blacks also tend to relish wielding authority, so you&rsquo;re unwise provoking a confrontation with a black cop because he will have to show you who is in charge. Whites are less touchy about this, but blacks often have a short fuse.</p>
<p>Poster #5 also has it right: <i> &#8220;What I see here is an extremely immature woman acting like an 11-year-old child.  Some children don&rsquo;t like taking orders from adults, so they indignantly refuse to comply.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>Absolutely.   Regardless of the behavior of the cop, any sensible person knows that if an officer tells you to move along, you shut your mouth and comply.  You don&rsquo;t stand there and argue with him.  Challenging his authority is the best way to get a free visit to the station house.  She got what she asked for.</p>

		<p>Sounds like one of those iffy situations. First the lady should have moved along when told to do so. And the cop should have given her an answer when she asked why, like you are blocking the sidewalk, you are in a bad area to be congregating, or whatever the situation was. THEN he should have arrested her if she still refused&hellip;..I&rsquo;m waiting to see how all this can be blamed on White racism. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve run into both pushy officers and pushy black women. But there&rsquo;s really no way of knowing who was pushing it in this situation. Still, I don&rsquo;t think an officer should be allowed to chase citizens off the sidewalks without a compelling reason. But the black on black &#8220;racism&#8221; is a nice touch. Regardless, I think we&rsquo;ve just found our next &#8220;ghetto lottery&#8221; winner.</p>

<p>If you want the left wing explanation, the black cops are part of a racist white police force and must conform with the racist tendencies of the white majority in order to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Oh and have to totally disagree with the notion that blacks would ever support white police officers over black ones. Blacks will put up with infinite abuse from their own kind  &mdash;  just as long as a blacks are in charge. How long has Mugabe been in power? How many African nations have had a democratic change in leadership without a bloodbath? How many black mayors have there been in charge of US cities who HAVEN&rsquo;t been corrupt or incompetent? </p>
<p>Conversely, even the slightest perceived injustice by any white in  any position of authority will immediately set off immediate bloody riots.</p>

<p>The suit claims that the city does not discourage APD from targeting the poor (read blacks) or minorities (blacks again). This is how the charge of &#8220;white racism&#8221; will be worked in, I&rsquo;m willing to bet; notwithstanding the fact that Atlanta has a black mayor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this women may have a legitimate case. Cops, white or black, are becoming more abusive all the time.</p>

<p>I only partially agree!  I DON&rsquo;T feel the cop had any obligation to give her any explanation of any kind. It&rsquo;s conceivable that he may have had good reasons for asking them to move from that spot, and she doesn&rsquo;t have to know everything that&rsquo;s going on. He wouldn&rsquo;t have done so without a reason.  It should be sufficient that when a police officer   &mdash;   an official who&rsquo;s vested with the proper authority   &mdash;   directs you to move, then you should move.  Period.   No arguments or mouthiness are called for.  An explanation might have been courteous on his part, but not requisite.  And probably her &#8220;black woman attitude&#8221;  had a lot to do with it. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, there&rsquo;s a lot of information that&rsquo;s missing from this sketchy story, so it&rsquo;s impossible to judge.</p>
