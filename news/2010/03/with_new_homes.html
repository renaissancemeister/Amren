<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/us/11housing.html?hp">With New Homes, Town Makes Amends for Its Bias</a></h1>

	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In 1971, a federal judge found that this old manufacturing town [Hamtramck], five miles from downtown Detroit, had deliberately used urban renewal projects throughout the 1950s and &rsquo;60s to obliterate black areas from its two square miles, displacing hundreds of families.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, though, in a time of deep recession and a housing slump in one of the most economically depressed states in the country, Hamtramck (pronounced ham-TRAM-eck) is at last fulfilling its legal  &mdash;  and what officials now call moral  &mdash;  obligation to provide affordable housing to the mostly poor families who were dislodged generations ago. {snip}</p>
<p>About 100 houses have been completed for rent or sale, and another 100 are on the way, paid for by a mix of local and state money.</p>
<p>In the last five years, the town began building the new houses, but the project stalled because of the recession. {snip} The homes, mostly two- and three-bedroom models, cost $140,000 to $160,000, and subsidies can reduce the price to $100,000; most rentals are in the $400-a-month range, after government assistance.</p>

		<p>Well, what so new about this?</p>
<p>Habitat for Humanity gets white folks to give free labor to build houses for the &#8220;disadvantaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loads of whites volunteer, and it makes them feel good, real good, knowing that they have helped &#8220;the least of these.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one of these events, shown on TV, ex-president Carter and Lindsey Graham led the whites in &#8220;Kum Ba Ya&#8221; and &#8220;We Shall Overcome.&#8221; Several whites gave out those hooting shouts that blacks are famous for.</p>
<p>So, white people, either give of your tax money or give your free labor  &mdash;  the choice is yours in modern America! </p>

		<p>Hamtramck is historically an old Polish town. The Polish took such immaculate care of their homes that they were known to go so far as sweeping their lawns with a broom after mowing to eliminate the tracks left by the mower. Now crack houses and low income housing projects are the present and future of Hamtramck. The diversity police have eaten the walls off of the rest of Detroit and now the final holdout will be assimilated.</p>

		<p>As someone who is currently trying to buy a home in Western Washington State, I am acutely aware of what I can and cannot afford.  My massive student loan debt doesn&rsquo;t help.  Most houses around here in that price range or either damaged and/or short sales.  To read that some people are simply being given these homes, when I worked my a*s off in grad school and now am almost priced out of the market thanks to my student loans, is infuriating.  What ever happened to hard work paying off?  Maybe if I had stayed in my dead end hometown and had three kids by three different Mexican men, I, too, would be given a house, perhaps by Habitat for Humanity. Probably have all my childcare needs paid for, too, as well as my food bill.  When, exactly, does responsibility get rewarded?!?  Never I guess.  </p>

		<p>So this handout comes on top of the public housing. Section 8 housing vouchers and welfare that blacks already receive?</p>
<p>Needless to say they&rsquo;re also demanding reparations since the taxpayers have been far too stingy! </p>

		<p>IS there any sanity left in this country? Let us ponder, we are in a &#8220;supposedly&#8221; deep recession, and they are going to build an instant slum for indigents to take over. Historically millions of people of all races have been displaced from their homes, yes even their countries. Are we to propose reparations for the whole of mankind, or should we pick and choose only from a perspective of political correctness? The proverb,&#8221;A fool and his money are soon parted,&#8221; certainly applies here. One can only wonder when payday comes, and China calls in their note. As I have stated before, &#8220;This country is run by educated idiots!&#8221;</p>

		<p>My cousin used to live in Hamtramck and I visited him and slept over several times in the 1970s.  It wasn&rsquo;t a great place, me being from the country and all, but it was all white and there was no sense of danger being outside on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The last time I was there was about ten years ago.  Indeed it has become a drug infested slum!  I can understand people feeling bad about losing their homes in unfair condemnations.  I just wonder if those people were compensated, because then they would have no cause for redress as white people get evicted for eminent domain all the time.</p>
<p>If the people were renters, then they darn for sure do not deserve to be given free houses, because renting is not owning.</p>
<p>But a more salient point is this: why do they need to be given brand new homes in Hamtramck?  The city is surrounded by Detroit, which has tens of thousands of vacant homes all over the place.  Wouldn&rsquo;t the city have saved money if they would have bought a bunch of those and gave them to the blacks?  Blacks do not care where they live as long as it is free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like blacks have some historical presence in Hamtramck going back hundreds of years.  All the blacks in the northern states immigrated in the last 75 years to take advantage of factory work, with most coming in the last 50 years and then having lots and lots of kids.</p>

		<p>I live in Michigan, and am more than a bit personally familiar with the particular legal details of this  specific case.</p>
<p>The basis of the case itself was not so much a matter of racial issues as it was the astoundingly blatant abuse of eminent domain powers as used by past Hamtramck city council members.</p>
<p>Yet again we have another example of big brother government using the law to squeeze people out of housing that they legally owned, which is a matter that, quite simply, exceeds any matter of race.</p>
<p>What makes this case exceptional to most other instances of the government abusing it&rsquo;s power is that, for some peculiar reason, the city council members in question were actually caught on tape quite literally conspiring to illegally abuse said powers of eminent domain in order to evict legal property owners from their homes   &mdash;   the fact of which (as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine) had a very dramatic effect within the courtroom where this particular case was tried.</p>
<p>Essentially, what we have here is a rather rare example of the legislative arm of the government being caught red-handed with it&rsquo;s hand in the illegal cookie jar, and the judicial branch slapping them down as a direct result.<br>

<p>LOL!  Thanks for the &#8216;shout out&rsquo; (I guess).</p>
<p>Misery does indeed love company and in the insane asylum in which I work (government schools) and live (California) AmRen and a few other sites provide me with a grounding of reality that is becoming increasingly uncommon everywhere else.</p>
<p>Habitat for Humanity in my area is built strictly for large immigrant families, illegal or otherwise, from mexico or central america.  I often read in the local paper that a poor family of 10 &#8216;came up from honduras&rsquo; (add one or more of the following: &#8216;only to work&rsquo; &#8216;for a better life&rsquo; &#8216;so the children could have a chance&rsquo; and the one I despise over all the others: &#8216;for their chance at the American dream&rsquo;).  This is followed by a long sob story of those left behind, including worries about their major medical problems.  </p>
<p>The msm must have these cliched stories and sayings on file to cut and paste repeatedly and at will.</p>
<p>You can be sure that &#8216;those left behind&rsquo; will follow the immigration daisy chain to the promised land.</p>
<p>They come here for Free White Money and medical treatment if needed.  </p>
<p>I have a friend who works with severely disabled students in a local government school  &mdash;  he says ALL of them are from other countries, left those hell-holes created by their people, to come here for treatment and receive it they do  &mdash;   expensive, extensive medical services  (plus monstrous amounts of money is spent on them in the schools for such things are special buses, specialized computers, specialized teachers, nurses that must be on duty at all times, adapted classrooms, small classes  &mdash;  while your child sits in broken-down classrooms of 45 or more with one working (and iffy at that) 15-year old computer).  </p>
<p>I have never once seen a White family receive a Habitat for Humanity home.  Not once, even though it appears the homes are built exclusively by Whites  &mdash;  with apparently some &#8216;help&rsquo; from the poor family that receives the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;subsidies can reduce the price to $100,000; most rentals are in the $400-a-month range, after government assistance&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This has little to nothing to do with giving ever more handouts to blacks.</p>
<p>THE primary goal of moving blacks into White neighborhoods is to further atomize, terrorize and control Whites and strip them of their wealth.</p>
<p>Those who complain will be axiomatically labeled as &#8216;hateful, bigoted Nazis&rsquo; and accused of terrorism, ethnic intimidation and Hate Speech.</p>
<p>I believe we are now at a crucial turning point as to whether the government is going to fully implement an authoritarian system like the old Soviet Union, or we Whites, feeling we are cornered, will stat to fight back, dismantle the PC reign of terror aimed solely at us, close the borders and regain some of our liberties.   There are a few signs of Whites waking up.</p>
<p>And finally: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.when I worked my a*s off in grad school and now am almost priced out of the market thanks to my student loans, is infuriating. What ever happened to hard work paying off?&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard work and personal responsibility are no longer rewarded if you&rsquo;re White as you&rsquo;re finding out.  The White-hating government looks upon you as cattle, to be herded as told, kept poor through confiscatory, satanic taxes, and kept terrorized by forced integration via Section 8 of blacks into White neighborhoods.</p>
<p>My daughter graduated Salutatorian of her class last year and received 5&rsquo;s on every AP test except Calculus BC on which she received a 4.  No scholarships were forthcoming.  She was outright rejected by every Ivy League school. She received no accolades from anywhere including the school she attended  &mdash;  no ceremony honoring her achievements, no pictures of the high achievers in the hallways,  No recruiters from major colleges came to our house to court her.  No colleges flew her east. No letters in the mail, no congratulatory phone calls from leaders of White ethnic groups to offer money and help.</p>
<p>But these things, including full rides, were offered to (only) non-Whites many places below her in rank.  Colleges that outright rejected her offered full rides to non-Whites ranking far below her.</p>
<p>The word infuriating does not begin to cover or define how we felt.</p>
<p>Her high-achieving Asians friends and an Asian colleague tell the same story  &mdash;  no scholarships, full rides, recruiters, paid-for trips to colleges for them or their children.  In many cases, for Asians, it is worse.</p>
<p>Are you convinced now that your government, the academic institutions founded by Whites, and especially the msm hate Whites and feel we are good for nothing except providing our earnings to them for the benefit of those not like us?</p>
<p>Start asking:  Is It Good For Whites?  If it isn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t do it or contribute your hard work or hard-earned money.  Donate it to White causes that promote White interests and will stand up for Whites. The government helps non-Whites enough as it is with our money, their race-based advocates promote for them, not us.</p>
<p>This is what I do.</p>
