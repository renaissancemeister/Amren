<h1>Former Birmingham Mayor Gets 15 Years for Bribery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, Washington Post, March 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was sentenced Friday to 15 years in federal prison for taking clothes, Rolex watches, loan payments and cash worth more than $240,000 as bribes in return for lucrative bond work.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Coogler imposed the sentence on Langford, 63, who told the court, &#8220;I am sorry all this has occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence was about nine years shorter than the minimum term sought by prosecutors. Asked outside court whether he was pleased, Langford sneered at a reporter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; said Langford, who claims he did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Langford and his wife have blamed his conviction on vindictive prosecutors, inattentive jurors and racism. Langford is black; most of the jurors were white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Langford, a dapper political figure, was convicted in October of taking cash, loans and gifts  &mdash;  including expensive clothes and jewelry  &mdash;  while he was president of the Jefferson County Commission. In exchange, prosecutors said, he steered county bond work to an investment banker who paid the bribes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sold Jefferson County out,&#8221; said Assistant U.S. Attorney George Martin.</p>
<p>He said Langford committed a &#8220;gross abuse of trust&#8221; with every Italian suit, Rolex watch and cash payment he received. Initially valued at $235,000, authorities said a final tally of the bribes came to $241,843  &mdash;  which Langford was ordered to repay, along with about $119,985 in back taxes. Langford must report to federal custody by April 5.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors had argued Langford showed no remorse and should spend up to 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>The defense said Langford had been ridiculed by news media and, based on another Jefferson County official&rsquo;s sentence for corruption, should spend no more than five years in prison.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Michael Rasmussen also argued Friday that the bond deals were in the best interest of the county at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, since that time things went sour, but they didn&rsquo;t go sour because of Mr. Langford,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Elected mayor in 2007, Langford was known for his rapid-fire ideas to revive the city. But some drew ridicule, such as his proposal to try to bring the 2020 Olympics to Birmingham, a city without a major sports franchise. He was automatically removed from office after his conviction.</p>

		<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Coogler imposed the sentence on Langford, 63, who told the court, &ldquo;I am sorry all this has occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So this is how a convicted criminal who abused his public office for personal financial gain expresses remorse??  &mdash;  In the passive voice.</p>
<p>No better than some crackhead in court telling the judge that he was waking down the street and a CIA agent forced him to take a couple of hits off the glass pipe. </p>
<p>Or like the Spanish language false passive voice of assigning blame to the plate that was thrown at the assaulted spouse in a domestic violence case. </p>

		<p>Blacks in Birmingham are racially incapable of committing any crime or corruption. If they are accused and convicted, then raciss whites were just protecting their unearned white privilege and showing continuing reluctance to acknowledge their own biases and raciss prejudices and their failures and correct ethical reasoning, which requires more racial empathy and social justice for innocent blacks, all of whom are innocent.</p>

<p>The Larry Langford breed and blacks are why Haiti is Haiti.    </p>
<p>In Haiti there are no intelligent hard working white people to support and feed the blacks after they ruin whatever they are in charge of.  That is why everything they do in Haiti falls apart.</p>
<p>America has white people to pick up after and to take care of the blacks saving them from stupid tribal chieftains like Larry Langford who live by graft.  But how much longer can it last with Obama as the big chief?<br/>

<p>Obama sits in the White House drinking, smoking, and bribing while poor Larry Langford does hard time.   <br/>

		<p>Many black politicians, especially of the old guard, see power as little more than an opportunity to grab.  That&rsquo;s the way it was done in the ghettos of the past, where all the blacks lived, and white officials paid scant attention to blacks fleecing blacks.  Many of these crooked pols still see black-majority cities as the same old fiefdoms and are surprised when some white or modern-thinking black prosecutor calls them out.</p>

		<p>Birmingham&rsquo;s first black mayor Richard Arrington escaped conviction for illegal acts similar to Langford&rsquo;s because he held office at a time when it was considered racist to bring criminal charges against newly elected blacks. Thank goodness we have evolved from that mindset. </p>

		<p>Yes, Langford does owe income tax on the bribes.  As Vice President Spiro Agnew discovered in 1973, income tax is owed even if the income is from illegal sources.</p>

		<p>How can he owe taxes on things he has to repay? Once repayed, he thus has them no more. Than amounts to taxes on nothing, but if that is the case, it wouldn&rsquo;t suprise me. Nothing really does anymore, at least from the Feds.</p>

		<p>15 years in prison may be an excessive sentence for this, but I doubt &#8220;racism&#8221; is the cause.  </p>

		<p>I think his sentence is too long, but I fail to see the racism aspect.  I&rsquo;m tired of hearing blacks use that &#8216;racism&rsquo; cop out everytime they get caught.  The only problem I can see is that people up in much higher positions of government and politics get away with a hell of a lot more.  I don&rsquo;t see it as a racial thing.  Sorry, Mr. Langford.</p>

		<p>Skip #3, Atlanta [of course] elected another black (male) as Mayor. However, his white (female) opponent now has a prestigious position in his administration.</p>
<p>In response to the article, sadly, IMO race has very little effect on politicians&rsquo; honesty or character. If it&rsquo;s a politician it&rsquo;s a liar and a thief - regardless of its color. Even if they didn&rsquo;t start out that way (which one might arguably say race does have bearing upon), they certainly quickly become lying, thieving slime.</p>
