			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, March 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Francisco high school students, just months out of middle school, can start earning San Francisco State college credit this fall through a ninth-grade ethnic studies course.</p>
<p>Currently, five ethnic studies courses are offered at three high schools, but they offer only high school credits. The school board voted to expand the ethnic studies program last week, increasing the number of courses to at least 10 sections at five high schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a school board meeting last week, the head of the university&rsquo;s Ethnic Studies program also promised that students would earn up to six college course credits for the high school freshman course  &mdash;  a rare opportunity for a 14-year-old.</p>
<p>The courses will become part of the California State University&rsquo;s Step to College program, which has offered college credit for high school students across the state since 1985. Most of those courses require students to be juniors or seniors.</p>
<p>The program is designed for students who might not otherwise be considering college as an option, said Jacob Perea, dean of the School of Education, who runs the Step to College program at San Francisco State.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students cannot fail the class. They either receive a &#8220;pass&#8221; grade or are withdrawn from the course if it appears they cannot pass, Perea said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The content of the courses offered in the Step to College program are reviewed by CSU faculty to ensure that they&rsquo;re equal to any offered at the university. The instructors teaching the courses are vetted and given university adjunct status while the course is in progress, Perea said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ethnic studies course &#8220;encourages students to explore specific aspects of identity on personal, interpersonal and institutional levels and provides students with interdisciplinary reading, writing and analytical skills,&#8221; district officials said in a news release about the expanded pilot program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t ever learn about the accomplishments and contributions of the people who look like me and the members of my family,&#8221; said Balboa High School freshman Monet Cathrina-Rescat Wilson during public comment at Tuesday&rsquo;s school board meeting. &#8220;How can I know who I can be if I don&rsquo;t know who I am? Ethnic studies provides me with the foundation to learn who I am.&#8221;<br>

<p>So, she can only identify with someone who looks exactly like her? Sounds like her foundation is grounded in racism. But that&rsquo;s A-Ok and &#8216;enlightenment&rsquo;, as long as you are not white. Then there&rsquo;s not that all important need to see people different from yourself. <br>

		<p>Speaking of college courses, I happened to find several textbooks in the dumpster in my back alley a few days ago.  They were all sold at the bookstore of a certain large university in St. Louis associated with the Jesuits, so it was intended for a course at that given University, not a Junior or Community College.  The books had the stamp of that university&rsquo;s bookstore.  Both books were various editions of introductory college mathematics, written by the same two authors, but different copyright years.  I thumbed through the pages, and much to my dismay, the math in those books is about on par with an average 6th grader&rsquo;s math textbook   &mdash;   Complicated arithmetic, with a slight introduction to algebra.</p>
<p>One would think that those accepted to this university, and we&rsquo;re talking about a school with above average entrance requirements, would have already mastered that kind of math a long time ago.</p>

<p>The above quote is a complete lie and the typical leftist garbage vomited out at occasions like this.  The truth is that all K-12 and college education in this nation has been coopted to constantly praise the (non-existant) accomplishments of Minorities.  Pick up any high-school textbook and everyother page will have a photo or a set-aside &#8220;box&#8221; showing some Minority person and touting this or that supposed accomplishment.  Even math and physics books, for God sake do this!  For example, a physics text will have a full page discussing &#8220;The first African-American to purchase a raido,&#8221; or &#8220;The first Hispanic person to use the Internet to organize a protest.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>How wonderful - a campaign to encourage to a bunch of anti-intellectual dopes to clog up and overwhelm our 2nd tier state schools.</p>
<p>And what are these college-bound underachievers likely to study at Cal State SF?</p>
<p>Some sort of ethnic study major, of course.</p>
<p>Just what this country needs - legions of semi-literate, unemployable and angry ethnic study majors.<br>

<p>Oh, really???? I find that hard to believe. I am a 9th grade World History teacher in a public high school, and I have to beg our academic council to permit me to include Western Civilization as a part of the curriculum. I can only assume that Monet Cathrina-Rescat Wilson cuts history class frequently.</p>

<p>I am assuming he/she is Black?? If so, (s)he must have been living in a cocoon since birth!! I mean, we just finished Black history month, a Black man is in the White House begging for change, and the &#8220;successes&#8221; of Blacks are constantly chirped about on just about every television station, radio wave, and website known to man.  If (s)he happens to be Hispanic, maybe head back to Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador and hear about what his/her people have accomplished there. </p>

<p>Maybe because &#8220;people who look like you&#8221; have &#8220;accomplished&#8221; VERY little without the White mans help and only &#8220;contribute&#8221; to the destruction of any land mass\civilization they happen to occupy. That clear enough for ya Monet!</p>
<p> &ldquo;How can I know who I can be if I don&rsquo;t know who I am? Ethnic studies provides me with the foundation to learn who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you need ethnic studies to prepare you for college, maybe you&rsquo;re not college material, hon. Why don&rsquo;t Asians need ethnic studies before going to college! You&rsquo;d do better to check out Maids are Us or something along that line.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile in India, China, and other countries which have a future, 14 year old High School students are learning mathematics, science, language, history, and other accademic subjects. These subjects are taught at a first/second year college level. The students taking &#8220;Ethnics&#8221; should be in vocational training where they could acquire the skills to be productive citizens. That&rsquo;s where they would have been prior to the 1960&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>3 Anon: One of the many small pleasures in teaching is asking the kids just what is wrong with all those pictures of women or minorities in &#8220;non-traditional&#8221; occupations. The auto mechanic with long hair hanging down over the engine, or the electrician using the cheap flashlight picked up at a grocery store.  Of course, the kids don&rsquo;t notice those details.  The joy is when I say &#8220;What is wrong?&#8221;, and they say something totally un-pc.  They see the larger lies on their own, I merely point out that the photo was staged. </p>

		<p>San Francisco, the city that&rsquo;s all heart and no mind, is proving once again that today&rsquo;s college degrees are worthless and mean absolutely nothing.  The standards are lower than a Tenderloin ho&rsquo;s pants.  It&rsquo;s no wonder that my 11 year old grandnephew has tested OUT of high school - a kid who has good intelligence and is properly homeschooled can come out WAY ahead of his peers if he applies himself.  Now, of course, comes the question:  why would he even WANT to go to some stupid university where the standards are laughable to all except those who have put them in place?  My boy is musically talented, so we&rsquo;re going to see about enrolling him in a private Christian college with high musical standards, and apprentice him to one of the best in the business (whom I just happen to know) - and let him make his way in the world of the commercial music business.  People who have intelligence today need to make it on their own - colleges and universities are no more than large middle-to-high schools and offer little to nothing of merit.</p>

		<p>I was once one of those fools that took ethnic studies classes.  I naively bought into everything I was taught growing up.  I thought a college degree in any field would be my ticket to fortune.  Now I&rsquo;m a receptionist working part-time in spite of the fact that I went to a prestigious school.  The only way you should be a liberal arts major is if you&rsquo;re going to be a professor.</p>

		<p>Read between the lines, folks. This is a desperate last ditch attempt to save the SFSU Ethnic Studies program. They are collapsing and will have to lay off staff soon. No one wants an &#8220;ethnic studies&#8221; degree because it leaves you unemployable with a bunch of debt. The profs at SFSU are desperately trying to save their own worthless skin by sucking in students too young to know any better. At age 17 when they want to go to a real college, they are going to be told that those credits are worthless and non-transferrable to any other school on God&rsquo;s green earth, at which time the SFSU Ethnic Studies Department hopes they will feel trapped into continuing on at SFSU so they can get some use out of those credits. Pathetic, actually.</p>

<p>There was a book years ago entitled, &#8220;the Jungle&#8221; that spoke about an immigrant family getting really conned. But they learned from the experience. Not so blacks. Too bad.</p>
