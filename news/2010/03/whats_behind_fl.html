<h1>What&rsquo;s Behind &#8216;Flash Mobs&rsquo;?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alfred Lubrano, Philadelphia Inquirer, March 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, what has been happening here is not yet understood. City leaders and social workers are casting about for potential reasons for such unnerving behavior: Is it is the parents, the lack of school activities, poverty, the Internet?</p>
<p>Theories aside, what is known for certain is that teenagers met on South Street on March 20  &mdash;  and in Center City on March 3, Feb. 16, and Dec. 18  &mdash;  summoned via social networking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In each of the four incidents, violence broke out. In each, the teenagers involved were overwhelmingly African American males, although prosecutors say a significant number were girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s happening because these kids out there have nothing to do. It&rsquo;s happening out of boredom,&#8221; said Marques Carson, 17, a student at Mastery Charter School in South Philadelphia. &#8220;They want to hang out and have fun, by any means necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He attributed some of the violence and destructive behavior to the dynamics of large groups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yale sociologist Elijah Anderson, a part-time Philadelphia resident renowned for his analysis of African American culture here, is writing about the so-called flash mobs in a book to come out next year. The gatherings had a &#8220;quasi-carnival atmosphere,&#8221; writes Anderson, calling them a &#8220;kind of social storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the kids arrested in the Philadelphia incidents were from impoverished neighborhoods. A lot of them, Assistant District Attorney Angel Flores said in an interview, were having fun amid the mayhem. &#8220;They had smiles on their faces as they scared people at random,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They thought that assaulting others was a form of enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were not on the hunt for particular victims, Flores said, although they trampled and punched people along the way  &mdash;  white, black, whomever  &mdash;  and damaged property. The biggest gathering was on South Street, where more than 2,000 people amassed, Flores said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>People have called these events flash mobs, but some say it&rsquo;s a misnomer, since flash mobs tend to be quirky, artistic gatherings organized on the Internet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Philadelphia appears to be leading this dubious trend. It&rsquo;s so new that the FBI, the American Psychological Association, and the Criminal Justice Program at the Harvard Kennedy School have no experts on &#8220;flash-mob violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In August 2009, Smith [Joe Smith, 52, a sales executive for a Swiss engineering company] was on the 500 block of Rodman Street when he was suddenly surrounded by young white women in high heels, holding cell phones. &#8220;They told me it was a flash mob,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On March 20, Smith, who lives 60 feet from South Street, experienced a very different sort of gathering. &#8220;About 100 people were stampeding at me and screaming, sounding happy, holding cell phones,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scared to death. Then I got knocked down and twisted my ankle.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Smith, who is white, said the &#8220;mostly African American group&#8221; wasn&rsquo;t trying to hurt him. &#8220;They didn&rsquo;t intentionally knock me down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there was any racial component. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A 32-year-old South Philadelphia auto-repair worker disagreed that race wasn&rsquo;t a factor last Saturday. The man, who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that at 11:30 p.m. March 20, he and his girlfriend were eating with a married couple at Bliss restaurant on South Broad Street, whose front windows open onto the street.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a &#8220;totally normal looking&#8221; black teenager hit the man&rsquo;s friend on the head three times, then ran off. The man followed, but soon gave up. As he returned to the restaurant, he heard other African American teens taunt him, saying, &#8220;What&rsquo;s the matter, white boy, you scared?&#8221; and &#8220;All the white people are scared&#8221; as they laughed.</p>
<p>Another person in Bliss at the time corroborated the account, for which no police report was filed. An Inquirer reporter who spent more than two hours on South Street observed one fight and some pushing and shoving, all involving black teenagers.</p>
<p>Anderson, the Yale sociologist whose specialty is urban inequality, said in an interview that he believed there was &#8220;pent-up frustration, even hostility&#8221; among young black people living alienated, isolated lives in &#8220;hyper-segregated, poor neighborhoods.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Young black males &hellip; become ever more defined as people to fear,&#8221; Anderson writes in his yet to be released book. &#8220;The negative reputation of the &#8216;iconic ghetto&rsquo; becomes powerfully reinforced .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as this large, unfathomable place that sprouts &#8216;bad&rsquo; people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[The mayor&rsquo;s] spokesman, Doug Oliver, added: &#8220;It&rsquo;s ridiculous to suggest that there&rsquo;s a racial motivation behind any of this activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Rich, a physician and an expert on urban violence at the Drexel University School of Public Health, said it would be foolish to ascribe racist tendencies to the youths who did violence, when their unformed teenage brains might be more to blame.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Philippe Bourgois, a Penn anthropologist, agreed. An expert on inner-city poverty and violence, Bourgois said that Philadelphia is a &#8220;city that expresses masculinity and toughness through violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;We have a violent tradition. This is a city that breaks windows to express happiness when the Phillies win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overshadowed by the news about violent black youths was a second, unpublicized gathering in Rittenhouse Square on the same night as the South Street event, according to Khalif Dobson, 18, a senior at West Philadelphia High School. Dobson is a member of the Philadelphia Student Union and participates in roundtables with Public Citizens for Children and Youth.</p>
<p>About 100 African American teenagers met in the square without incident after reading about it on Facebook, Dobson said. Police said there was no record of any disturbance there that night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students and community activists say that, given city budget cuts, there aren&rsquo;t many activities for young people, and gatherings like the one on South Street might become more commonplace.</p>
<p>As the end of the school year approaches, it becomes a worry, given the social-media mobbing that&rsquo;s occurred.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People should remember,&#8221; said Dobson, the high school senior, quoting Martin Luther King: &#8220;The riot is the language of the unheard.&#8221;</p>

		<p>All this pent-up frustration?  Wasn&rsquo;t Obama&rsquo;s election supposed to cure this?  Instead, it seems to me that it has caused this, in that it has made urban blacks more arrogant.  It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t have anything to do, this is what they want to do, organize anti-white mob wildings, Haiti and Zimbabwe style.</p>
<p>The auto repair worker who said that race wasn&rsquo;t a factor turned right around and stated why race was a factor.  </p>
<p>If the FBI, APA and Harvard had experts on flash mobs, would it really matter?  They wouldn&rsquo;t tell us the truth anyway.</p>

<p>Newsweek published Po Bronson&rsquo;s screed about how horrible white babies are for being racist, which was an ironic compliment to the native born genius of white babies.  </p>
<p>Is your baby a racist? <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/id/214989" rel="nofollow">https://www.newsweek.com/id/214989</a><br>
I hope so.</p>
<p><br>
If afrovoodoothug teen brains aren&rsquo;t &#8220;formed&#8221; enough yet to be racists against Whites, but little White babies are &#8220;formed&#8221; enough to be racist against blacks, then the achievement gap is wider that we guessed and will remain an even more impossible chasm.</p>

<p>The riot,Mr. Dobson may be the language of the unheard,but it is also the all-too-frequently heard language of the American black population. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,it&rsquo;s been heard far,far too often. And your reading matter could use some broadening. Other people besides King have written on the subject of unruly mobs. Next time you&rsquo;re close to a computer terminal,look up the phrase &#8220;A whiff of the grape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hint-the &#8220;grape&#8221; in that phrase has nothing to do with any sort of fermented beverage.</p>

It&rsquo;s telling that one always has to have a convoluted theory to explain black behavior.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Why is being around blacks always considered &#8216;the wrong place at the wrong time&rsquo;?</p>
<p>For even more covoluted spin, check out this article from Newsweek:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/id/235534" rel="nofollow">https://www.newsweek.com/id/235534</a></p>
<p>From the Newsweek article:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;So it really isn&rsquo;t shocking that flash mobs would appeal to these poor African-American teenagers in Philly &mdash; their neighborhoods are extremely violent, their schools are bad&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So you see, it&rsquo;s not the people who inhabit these neighborhoods, it&rsquo;s the neighborhoods that are the problem.<br>

		<p>Flash mobs are nothing new. Do a search on YouTube for &#8220;flash mob&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of examples of white Europeans and Americans using them to stage pillow fights, dances and the like in public places. When whites are involved, flash mobs are harmless fun, but when blacks do it, they turn them into yet another form of wilding  &mdash;  the same kind of pack behavior we&rsquo;ve come to expect from &#8220;youths&#8221; with &#8220;unformed brains.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for all these official denials that racism had anything to do with it, we&rsquo;ve heard it all before. These officials are either lying outright or completely deluded, but that&rsquo;s nothing new either. Most of them are probably lying the way &#8220;officials&#8221; always do, but a sizable percentage of them have been so brainwashed by decades of indoctrination that they probably have a mental block that keeps them from seeing reality even when it walks up to them and punches them in the mouth.</p>
<p>Whites need to wake up and start defending themselves against these violent, animalistic pack-attacks.   </p>

		<p>So they&rsquo;re bored.  That&rsquo;s why they run around attacking white people and looting businesses.  White kids never get bored evidently.  No liberal excuse making would be complete without the usual call for loads of hostile blacks to be put in middle class white neightborhoods to escape their &#8220;isolated lives in hyper-segregated, poor neighborhoods.&rdquo;   The endless excuses that white liberals and black apologists give for black lawlessness and aggression never ceases.  </p>

<p> Mr. Lubrano, what do you not understand about &#8220;urban centers + large numbers of blacks = violence and chaos&#8221;? It&rsquo;s not &#8220;poverty&#8221; and it&rsquo;s not &#8220;boredom&#8221; and it&rsquo;s not &#8220;pent-up frustration&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a society in which those with the least impulse control and most minimal pull of conscience   &mdash;   that is, blacks   &mdash;   have discovered they can get away with such things because for the authorities to deal with them as they SHOULD be dealt with would rise ear-splitting cries of &#8220;Racism!&#8221; and &#8220;police brutality!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Oh what a gem, of trendy &ldquo;sociological&rdquo; Marxism!</p>
<p>1.) &ldquo;Anderson, the Yale sociologist whose specialty is urban inequality, said in an interview that he believed there was &lsquo;pent-up frustration, even hostility&rsquo; among young black people living alienated, isolated lives in &lsquo;hyper-segregated, poor neighborhoods.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But why should this be Comrade Anderson?</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;hyper-segregated, poor neighborhoods&rdquo; are suddenly infused with whites of means, that gets called &ldquo;hyper-gentrification&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural-annihilation.&rdquo;  Thus, &ldquo;pent-up frustration, even hostility&rdquo; unleashed against such integrating and progressive whites is seen as understandable &ldquo;urban inequality&rdquo; redistribution by proximity;</p>
<p>2.) And, &ldquo;John Rich, a physician and an expert on urban violence at the Drexel University School of Public Health, said it would be foolish to ascribe racist tendencies to the youths who did violence, when their unformed teenage brains might be more to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How odd, has Comrade Rich discussed this with Comrade Jane Elliot (and other self-righteous white child abusers) that are celebrated as &ldquo;anti-discrimination pioneers and paragons?&rdquo; </p>
<p>How infinitely more strange and deranged if he has not, since he can hold that &ldquo;unformed teenage brains might be more to blame&rdquo; in regard to nonwhite adolescent violence, but white third graders (eight and nine year olds) are not only guilty of &ldquo;racist tendencies,&rdquo; but must be sadistically purged of their uninhibited &ldquo;racism&rdquo; through &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; torture sessions.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

Sure there is. Right here at AmRen. Here are my findings regarding &#8220;flash mobs&#8221;: They are comprised of almost 100% blacks. They attack, almost 100% of the time, White people. They enjoy the hell out of it. </p>
<p>There ya go American Psychological Association, and the Criminal Justice Program at the Harvard Kennedy School. After reading the above paragraph, you may now consider yourself experts. </p>

<p><br>
Right Mr Rich. Could you please explain to us why these &#8220;youths&#8221; attack White people who are VASTLY outnumbered instead of going to an all black neighborhood and attacking blacks?? And could you also explain to me how you became an EXPERT on urban violence???</p>

		<p><i>John Rich, a physician and an expert on urban violence at the Drexel University School of Public Health, said it would be foolish to ascribe racist tendencies to the youths who did violence, when their unformed teenage brains might be more to blame.</i></p>
<p>This frantic and desperate casting about to find rationalizations for violent behavior would be utterly laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so pathetic (and if so many people didn&rsquo;t pretend to believe it). Notice that no excuse of &#8220;unformed brains&#8221; is ever given when white teenagers do something &#8220;racist.&#8221; I believe we&rsquo;re dealing with unformed brains too, but I&rsquo;m afraid the condition is permanent.</p>
<p>Equally absurd is this:</p>
<p><i>Students and community activists say that, given city budget cuts, there aren&rsquo;t many activities for young people, and gatherings like the one on South Street might become more commonplace.</i></p>
<p>This implies that young blacks are too stupid to initiate their own wholesome, productive &#8220;activities.&#8221; Ever heard of hobbies? Or youth groups, church groups, volunteer activities, sports? No, these people need the all-wise, all-knowing white government to come in and create activities for them, otherwise they&rsquo;ll be totally helpless and will turn to violence. (Notice also that both of the quoted statements above are disguised insults of blacks.) </p>
<p>Also, wasn&rsquo;t the excuse for there not being more blacks in the technology professions that they &#8220;didn&rsquo;t have access&#8221; to technology? Today&rsquo;s blacks have cellphones, texting, computers and Twitter. So why aren&rsquo;t they learning things like computer programming in their spare time. (Don&rsquo;t tell me, I already know the answer).</p>

		<p>Note: Dr. Rich and Prof. Anderson are Black, but irrespective of race these social scientists sound like advocates not like scientists.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are ignorant of evolutionary sociology. The rule is that in primate groups ex-dominant males are subjected to abuse and destruction by the new dominant males or by wannabe&rsquo;s. This explains the actions and attitudes of Black males toward white men in flash mobbing. </p>

		<p>It is very curious that black mob violence is being termed as a flash mob.  I remember that, when they were first reported in the mainstream media, flash mobs were merely loosely organized displays of surreal activity (pillow fights in a park, etc.).  Is black mob violence organized by electronic communication being called flash mobs in an attempt to somehow mute the real gravity of the situation by associating it with something fun and harmless?</p>

Large group of blacks bang on whites near exclusively.  What is so hard to comprehend?  Also, it is curious how this new phenomena of flash mobs among blacks has the professors providing a ready yet un-researched explanation calling it benign and race neutral.  Question, are there any behaviors by blacks that the professors would consider racist?</p>

<p>This Yale academic misses the obvious and it&rsquo;s staring him right in the face.</p>
<p> Hypersegregated northestern cities like Philadelphia and the sharply defined racial composition between predominately black cities and predominately white suburbs, are segregated primarily because of this kind of primitive behavior. </p>
<p>White people, even white liberals will do just about anything to physically separate themselves from these sub-human hazards. Can anyone say white flight???</p>
<p>Northern urban blacks tend to be more confrontacious and violent than their southern bretheren. But fortunately this aggression is offset through demographic control and through the use of urban containment. Affluent northern suburbs figured this defacto strategy out many years ago, but of course, almost nobody would ever admit it.  </p>

		<p>I attended Penn in the 1980s.  The effete professors had no idea how to explain the dangers of stepping off-campus, nor did they try, but we all learned soon enough what could happen when you wandered too far away from the protection of campus security.  West Philadelphia, today as it was twenty-five years ago, is a filthy and hopeless place.  It was once a beautiful &#8220;suburb&#8221; of Center City, with grand houses, clean thoroughfares, and Fairmount Park, one of the world&rsquo;s largest city parks, which was the former pride of Philadelphia.  Today one can visit Fairmount Park on any summer Sunday afternoon, and you will be treated to the sights of the refuse left behind by the dwellers of the &#8220;iconic ghetto.&#8221; The Penn anthropologist (that is, apologist) quoted in the article is called an &#8220;expert on inner-city poverty and violence.&#8221;  He blamed &#8220;the city that expresses masculinity and toughness through violence.&#8221;  I do not know what is masculine or tough about huge gangs of blacks descending on a few isolated and unarmed white people, nor can I follow the logic of blaming a city or &#8220;tradition&#8221; on a totally new phenomenon of black violence.  I must be racist.</p>

		<p>It seems to be getting more and more difficult for leftists to explain away criminal, uncivilized black behavior like &#8220;flash mobs.&#8221; And what kind of nonsense name is that anyway? It further deflects attention from the truth.</p>
<p>Blacks should be embarrassed and shamed by such behavior. Not surprisingly, they don&rsquo;t seem to care. Meanwhile, whites should simply not tolerate or allow others to justify what is basically domestic terrorism perpetrated by brainless, unsupervised, low IQ groups of functional illiterates. </p>
<p>Sooner or later, I fear, it will reach a breaking point, when these flash mobs will be suddenly confronted with flashes from legal firearms aimed by whites defending their families and places of business. Certainly, no one wants to see that happen. </p>
<p>But if the police minimize it and the press ignores it and the leftists excuse it they each have only themselves to blame for the rain of ruin that awaits them. </p>
<p>White people may be tolerant and patient but there is a limit. Europeans didn&rsquo;t come rule the world through brains alone - when it matters whites have no equal in the prosecution of war.</p>

<p>Exactly. And how about reading? Do they ever go to the library?  Nobody ever &#8220;gave&#8221; me anything to do, but I always kept occupied   &mdash;   to the point that I didn&rsquo;t have enough hours in the day for all my interests   &mdash;   I didn&rsquo;t have to riot out of boredom and lack of things to do.  </p>
<p>Just more excuses, excuses for irresponsible, anti-social behavior!  Blacks are never held to account for their behavior; when they misbehave, it&rsquo;s always somebody else&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Another point:  Observing today&rsquo;s blacks, I am amazed to see how totally dependent they are on all electronic gadgetry   &mdash;   cell phones, boom boxes,  TV&rsquo;s.  Without these gadgets for constant diversion, they would be lost if they had to spend just ten  minutes alone with themselves. They don&rsquo;t know how to occupy their own minds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wager these kids probably come from homes where the TV is never off. Example: a black woman that I worked with, used to turn on the TV the moment she got home. It remained on until she finally fell asleep with it still playing. She slept with it on! It was on all the time!  Other blacks at work would turn on their personal TV&rsquo;s as soon as they arrived, before they even took off their coats. Even while removing their coats, their eyes were already riveted on the TV.  And they&rsquo;re indiscriminate: sitcoms, basketball games, Jerry Springer shows&hellip; ANYTHING &hellip;it didn&rsquo;t matter. They just had to have constant TV.   It&rsquo;s an addiction that they can&rsquo;t live without.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new. In Charlotte, all of our city gatherings have been ruined by Blacks out &#8220;having a good time.&#8221; The problem is that  having a good time for Blacks somehow always involves gratuitous violence. We used to have fantastic New Year&rsquo;s celebrations with music and fireworks, but then Blacks started finding White families an amusing source of entertainment as they would rush the crowds with bandannas over their faces and create a mob panic as scared families ran from the hordes of fun loving Blacks. Now every December 31st the streets are filled with riot squads and families get sparser every year. Soon I&rsquo;m sure that the celebrations will cease, then when Blacks engage in all out rioting, liberals will blame Whites for cancelling the festivities and giving Blacks nothing to do.</p>

<p>None of these &#8220;educated&#8221; idiots seems to understand that blacks overwhelmingly are the criminal class in America, that if they all disappeared tomorrow America would be the most crime-free nation on earth. Anyone having the slightest doubt of this needs only to print out a copy of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s The Color of Crime and read it. It&rsquo;s probably the most fearlessly direct analysis of race and crime ever done in America.</p>
<p>Of course, to the aforementioned educated idiots, the clear unvarnished truth of Taylor&rsquo;s seminal work on this topic is all the more reason to pointedly ignore it, or if it&rsquo;s forcibly brought to their attention, to hysterically decry it.</p>

If mobs of white skinheads ran through the black business district in some city and attacked and intimidated black people do you actually think that some professor from Yale would be making up excuses for their behavior. And then saying that they are from poor white neighborhoods and have no community activities to keep them off the streets. And when did whites suddenly become such cowards.

		<p>Clearly hate-crimes happened during this flash mob, this is just the standard leftist tactic of defending hate-crimes against whites by going into the therapeutic mode.   They can&rsquo;t quite deny the hate-crimes,  but they muddy the waters the best they can.  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;People should remember,&#8221; said Dobson, the high school senior, quoting Martin Luther King: &#8220;The riot is the language of the unheard.&#8221;</i>  Unheard?  Since when are blacks or the liberals who claim to speak for them unheard?   They can&rsquo;t shut up.     Riots in this day and age seldom come from the &#8220;unheard&#8221;,  instead they reflect a kind of dance between those in power, their favored groups, and their victims.     What is important about  the racial violence that took place in Philadelphia is its casualness.    They flash mob didn&rsquo;t go there with the aim of committing hate-crimes and the majority probably didn&rsquo;t participate in those crimes but the crimes were spontaneously committed by people who understood that the crimes would not be disapproved of by the majority of the mob, by the black community in general,  and most importantly,  by the Liberal establishment that has power in this country, as this article and the lack of hate crimes charges prove.   </p>

		<p>So the boredom city kids experience causes flash mob violence?  Then why, pray tell, are kids in small, whitebread towns with less to do than in any city so relatively well-behaved?</p>
<p>Strange, in the last little town I lived in, bored young fellows would hang around outside the convenience store, yet I never once felt threatened by any of &#8216;em.  The worst I heard of them getting up to would be playing pranks on the school janitor (which my ol&rsquo; man was for 14 years.)  There&rsquo;s a big difference between soaping school windows and gathering in mobs for to beat people up.</p>

		<p>Anderson, the Yale sociologist whose specialty is urban inequality, said in an interview that he believed there was &ldquo;pent-up frustration, even hostility&rdquo; among young black people living alienated, isolated lives in &ldquo;hyper-segregated, poor neighborhoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when white people live together in all white neighborhoods, the teens don&rsquo;t feel oppressed and rampage through town centers looking for blacks to beat up.</p>
<p>The tone of the article was that it&rsquo;s really all just harmless fun by youths who are racially oppressed and getting out their frustration of having to live around each other.</p>

<p><b><i>&ldquo;People should remember,&rdquo; said Dobson, the high school senior, quoting Martin Luther King: &ldquo;The riot is the language of the unheard.&rdquo;  </i></b></p>
<p>Unheard?  They control the city administration in Philadelphia; they have a black president in the White House; and STILL they complain about being &#8220;unheard&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s kidding whom?</p>
<p>I thought the election of Obama was supposed to put an end of all their whining about exclusion and neglect. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have made a bit of difference.</p>

Poor white people have always lived in poor, economically segregated neighborhoods too.  So what?  Did that give them the right to go wilding through the city, attacking people at random for their amusement?</p>
<p>One gets the strong impression that NO MATTER WHAT these &#8220;urban youth&#8221; may do, they will never be criticized by such such clearly biased sociologists as the above. To him, they can do no wrong.</p>

<p>A high percentage of this wilding crowd in Philly was girls and women.  Yet, they tell us they were &#8220;expressing their masculinity&#8221; through violence.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Funny&hellip;I have not heard of this phenom in Memphis&hellip;.maybe it is our counceled carry laws? This type of riot could end up badly for the rioters in Memphis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Memphis is full of dangerous black ghettos where white people are afraid to go.  Blacks are taking over the whole Memphis metropolitan area.  I notice a lot of Southerners have this smug attitude about black on white violence in the North and are blind to the racial problems in their own back yard that are as bad or worse.  </p>

		<p>By the way, PA is a &#8220;shall issue&#8221; concealed carry state.  It has more NRA members and hunters per capita than any other state.  That&rsquo;s not the problem here.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s behind &#8220;Flash Mobs?<br>
City leaders and social workers are casting about for potential reasons for such unnerving behavior: Is it is the parents, the lack of school activities, poverty, the Internet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They thought that assaulting others was a form of enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flash Mobs are a mix of low IQ, teenage rebellion, and satisfying irrational hatred for whites - whom they blame for not being successful, rich, and content.</p>
