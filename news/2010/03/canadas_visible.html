<h1>Canada&rsquo;s Visible Minority Population to Nearly Double by 2031</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Mahoney, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of visible minorities in Canada is expected to nearly double in the next two decades, according to new projections that highlight the country&rsquo;s growing diversity.</p>
<p>One in every three Canadians will be non-white by 2031, Statistics Canada said Tuesday. In Toronto, the country&rsquo;s most diverse city, nearly two in three faces will be non-white.</p>
<p>&#8220;A larger share of the visible minority population will be born in Canada, so they will be children of immigrants or grandchildren of immigrants,&#8221; said Laurent Martel, a Statscan analyst. &#8220;So it is the face of the Canadian-born population that is likely to change over the next two decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, between 29 and 32 per cent of the Canadian population could belong to a visible minority group in 2031, double the proportion recorded in the 2006 census, Statscan said in a release.</p>
<p>As well, at least a quarter of the population could be born outside the country in 20 years, with more than half of those from Asia. This would be the highest proportion ever of foreign-born Canadians, surpassing the 22 per cent level seen between 1911 and 1931.</p>
<p>Canada has one of the highest foreign-born populations in the world; only Australia and New Zealand have higher proportions, Mr. Martel said.</p>
<p>The foreign-born population is expected to increase about four times faster than the rest of the population, driving much of the country&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>In addition, diversity will also increase among the Canadian-born population due to visible minorities&rsquo; younger age structure and slightly higher fertility rates.</p>
<p>The country could have between 11.4 million and 14.4 million visible minorities by 2031, depending on the growth projections used. In 2006, the country had 5.3 million non-whites. By contrast, the rest of the population will grow by less than 12 per cent.</p>
<p>Visible minorities are defined as &#8220;persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost all visible minorities will live in large cities, with 71 per cent calling Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal home. By 2031, 63 per cent of Torontonians would be non-white if current demographic trends continue. Vancouver would be 59 per cent non-white while Montreal would be 31 per cent.</p>
<p>The national statistics agency developed the projections using several growth scenarios based on different immigration, fertility and mortality assumptions.</p>
<p>Newcomers settle in urban areas because the sheer size of the cities means more job opportunities, which then leads to the creation of ethnic communities, said University of Toronto professor Jeffrey Reitz.</p>
<p>&#8220;(They) become kind of magnets in themselves for people of similar backgrounds,&#8221; said the ethnic and immigration studies professor. &#8220;The existence of the communities in the cities sort of tends to become a self-perpetuating process.&#8221;</p>
<p>As is the case now, South Asians would still be the largest group, representing 28 per cent of the visible minority population. The community would more than double from 1.3 million people in 2006 to between 3.2 million and 4.1 million in the next two decades. The Chinese population is expected to grow from 1.3 million to between 2.4 million and 3 million. Overall, however, the share of Chinese would drop to 21 per cent from 24 per cent.</p>
<p>Statscan said the black and Filipino populations could double in size. The fastest growth is among Arabs and West Asians, groups that could more than triple in 20 years.</p>
<p>By 2031, Statscan said 47 per cent of second-generation Canadians would be non-white, nearly double the proportion of 24 per cent in 2006. Second generation means people who are born in Canada to at least one foreign-born parent.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s increasing diversity will also mean changes in Canadians&rsquo; religious affiliations. By 2031, the number of people who are non-Christian would almost double from 8 per cent in 2006 to 14 per cent. Of those, about half would be Muslim, up from one-third in 2006. Conversely, the number of Christians would decline to 65 per cent from 75 per cent.<br>

		<p>There is one major problem with these demographics projections - they assume the world economy will continue to cook along as it has for the past 50 or 60 years.  That is not going to happen.  The US is insolvent and heading toward the cliff, the babbling rhetoric of our inept and corrupt politicians notwithstanding.  As our economy slides into the abyss, we&rsquo;ll drag others along with us, including our friends to the north.  It will be a bumpy ride between now and 2031.       </p>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t like to talk about white flight from the big cities although it must number in the hundreds of thousands since diversity became an immigration objective. I&rsquo;ve met so many whites who still work in Toronto but live in the far suburbs. Partly it&rsquo;s because the cost of housing is cheaper but it&rsquo;s also to get their kids out of the high schools. I&rsquo;ve heard of white kids hating the idea of going to high school in Toronto.</p>
<p>Another thing the authorities don&rsquo;t like to talk about is helping European Canadians develop an ethnic identity now that we are to be a minority ourselves. They love to talk about the identities of the other groups but the fate of whites is to be a pale ghost-like people without ethnic interests.  </p>

		<p>White Advocate, we have as much value to them as a white canvas over which they can paint their &#8220;rainbow of diversity.&#8221;  A nation is its people.  Without Whites there is no Western Civilization, just pieces of land on which it once sat.  Whites are the only people for whom it&rsquo;s immoral to have their own country.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to add that I don&rsquo;t think that the phenomenon of white flight can apply as much as in the case Toronto as all of its large, surrounding commuter/suburb towns are pretty much as non-white as Toronto proper. And, as one would expect, each of these towns has a featured concentration -</p>
<p>Markham - Chinese<br>
Brampton - Sikhs<br>
Scarborough - Tamils and, I believe, Jamaican&hellip; hence the name &#8220;Scarlem&#8221;<br>
Mississauga - Pakistanis, though I&rsquo;m not entirely sure on this one<br>
North York - Jamaicans (Jane &amp; Finch!)</p>
<p>As for white ethnics, there&rsquo;s Woodbridge with its Italian, as well as North York with its Jews, who, having all settled there in 20s or so, are markedly absent from the more &#8216;frontier&rsquo; suburbs.</p>

<p>These sorts of statistics are purposly misleading as we here know. The &#8220;minority % will increase exponentially with every birth, every immigrant (chain migration) legal or illegal. It will be like doubling the amount of pennies one puts on checkerboard squares, doubling the previous squares&rsquo; on each successive one until I can&rsquo;t count that high!</p>

		<p>Ah yes racial/ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.  Because it worked out so well in Yugoslavia, Bosnia, the Roman Empire, South Africa, Rhodesia, India, Haiti, etc, etc that surely we should keep trying it.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect?  Well, at least until there are no more whites with which to keep practicing.  Which I suspect is what the diversity loving zealots have as their goal in the first place.</p>

		<p>33% non-white is slightly misleading.</p>
<p>Like most whites around the world, Canadians no longer reproduce at replacement levels.</p>
<p>This ensures only 50% are under the age of 40, compared to 75% of typical third world immigrants.</p>
<p>In England, 15% of the population is non-white, yet they produce 35% of the new born.</p>
<p>Simple arithmetic points toward a white English minority by 2025 (in the under 40 age group) and given Canada&rsquo;s overall 33% I imagine the under 40&rsquo;s are now 50/50, and the under 20&rsquo;s 60/40.</p>
<p>I have only one question for the multiculturalists:</p>
<p>If racial civil wars break out, a la Yugoslavia, and whites lose their homelands, where do you suggest we go in this inhospitable world?</p>

<p>Caucasians will be at the 50% mark in 2050 (or 2042, depending on how projections reflect actual population group). But caucasian isnt the same as white - American whites are at the 50% mark right now not counting illegals, and by 2050 whites will compose 20-25% of the total population with non white caucasians making up 25-30%. </p>
<p>By having increasingly slippery definitions of whos white and whos not, the census bureau can ensure a solid white majority on paper well past 2050, but they will not be able to paint over the real world effects of an actual white minority. The canadian census appears to use the same slippery definition of white so I would guess the situation in Canada is much worse than one could expect. </p>

		<p>I agree with #3 and others.  There is no western civilization without white people.  The black community in America follows its own rhythms.  The latinos are retaining their own culture.  White civilization has its own cultural patterns.  I was reading in newsweek yesterday how people from different cultures even use different areas of their brains to process numbers.  Westerners use the word-processing areas for number computation, while asians use their spatial-processing areas.  So different cultures even wire our brains differently.</p>
<p>Who produced the concept of natural rights?  It was whites.  No other civilization has produced the varied political ideologies we talk about today, whether capitalism, marxism, socialism, communism or anything else. </p>
<p>Our cities are now majority &#8216;minority&rsquo; and everything is falling apart.  The various races are not mixing (latinos, blacks and asians keep their distance from each other by and large).  Whites have a few older guys in the city administrations, but they are being replaced by &#8216;minorities&rsquo; who are constantly being caught in corruption scandals.  One after another!</p>
<p>Whites are the base of the tax base that supports government.  Most asians and latinos I know do under the table or tax evasion.  Blacks have their own underground economy.  What will happen when the back of the white taxpayer is broken?  The government will collapse and the country will break apart.  I am amazed that so many people dismiss the idea that our nation would ever break apart.  They wax nostalgic about our long and great history.  I got news for those folks: all multi-ethnic nations eventually bust apart, and we voluntarily transformed this nation into a multi-ethnic, &#8216;diverse&rsquo; nation.  We have to accept the natural result.</p>
<p>Show me any nation, anywhere in the world, that has remained together if it does not have a majority population holding the rest together by force.  All you see are nations that have either broken apart with terrible civil wars, or that are continually on the brink of doing so.  If diversity has not worked in any country, anywhere in the world for all of human history, what makes the racial marxists think they can pull it off here?</p>

		<p>#5 Indo-Canadian, you&rsquo;re one stage behind white flight. I&rsquo;m talking about whites living in Oakville, Courtice, Barrie, Port Perry, and Orangeville. I know a guy who&rsquo;s determined to live his whole life, including into retirement, deprived of the blessings of diversity so he commutes to Toronto from Lindsay. A big irony is that the same liberal progressives who are pushing immigration and diversity are the same ones who don&rsquo;t like urban sprawl and the car culture. </p>
<p>The biggest irony is that this social experiment is being pushed by those who are proud of their liberal political philosophy. They are now trapped in their own rhetoric. What happens if diversity and immigration are found to be bad for Canada? How could liberals now admit that a big mistake has been made and Canada will suffer from social problems? They can&rsquo;t admit it, they can&rsquo;t entertain any possibility of it, they can&rsquo;t even debate it. So we get boundless cheer-leading and applause for diversity. Some liberals!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Like most whites around the world, Canadians no longer reproduce at replacement levels&#8221;.</p>
<p>I believe the birth rate is simply tracked by the number of women who have childen. Or even the number of white women having children. So the white &#8216;birth rate&rsquo; could be misleading. How many of the children lumped in the white birth rate catagory have non-white fathers?</p>

		<p>Well, we&rsquo;re talking about a country that wanted to give a state funeral (despite having its largest budget deficit ever) to its last WWI veteran  &mdash;  a man who did not serve in battle and loved Canada so much he decided to live in the U.S. for his remaining eighty years.  But of course, the Kaiser would have forced us to speak a foreign language so this all makes sense in neo-Canada, where wars for &#8220;freedom&#8221; (as in Afghanistan) trump any sort of race-realism, historical honesty (they scuttled a plaque at the war museum questioning the efficacy of WWII area bombings) or political modesty.  We are on a mission!  Our immigration policies merely reflect our warped values.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be deceived, my friends.  This is strictly intimidation designed to make whites accepting of what they want us to believe is the inevitable, just as the radical leftist ad agencies put brown faces in all the ads hoping we&rsquo;ll be trained to accept them as the norm.</p>
<p>So many incidents will occur in just the next ten years it&rsquo;s impossible to predict anything with certainty except the demise of the American Empire which is on the way out right now, and Canada and Europe will be right behind us&hellip;if not in front.</p>

		<p>#21 QD, if a person can get an income, Niagara Falls would be a far better place to live than Toronto. It would be a tough commute though. It&rsquo;s 1 1/2 hours with good traffic but the highway gets clogged up pretty bad during rush hours. When snowing in winter there can be spectacular multi-car crashups involving 50 or more cars. I haven&rsquo;t heard of Niagara Falls being used by commuters.   </p>

		<p>Only Whites are supposed to accept their marginalization and dispossession in so sheepish a manner. Decades of marxist indoctrination in the schools and academia has worked wonders! There was never any reason for Canada to lose its White heritage. Nor can displacing Whites mean a future FOR WHITES. Canada could get all the White immigrants it wants but the corrupt Canadian government won&rsquo;t let them in. There are millions of people in eastern Europe who would love to come here. In the Ukraine ALONE, Ukrainian-community leaders are on record as saying that a million people would easily like to come to Canada. Some years ago a rumour spread in Kiev that the Canadian embassy there would begin issuing Visas. Within a few hours a crowd of over 100,000 had gathered. Our degenerate government prefers to dissolve the Canadian people and elect a new one! Nice to see that all those Canadian soldiers who sacrificed in all those wars were really just fighting to make Canada safe for &#8220;south Asians&#8221; and other non-Whites to replace them and take over the cities their ancestors built. </p>

		<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget that the downfall of White Canada began in 1965 when our idiot Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson was convinced by one of his advisers to change Canada&rsquo;s immigration laws and flood the country with Third Worlders who would then vote for the Liberal Party and keep them in power.  If that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, Pierre Trudeau, arguably our very worst Prime Minister, damned us all to hell by declaring Canada to be a multicultural country.  &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the immigrants come from!&#8221;, he said.   I guess not.   Toronto now has more Somalis than Irishmen.   </p>

		<p>Reply to Canada guy at #25:</p>
<p>May I salute you on an excellent post.</p>
<p>Lester Pearson was a catastrophe for Canada. The &#8220;adviser&#8221; you are referring to is Tom Kent. He was never elected to any political office but was Pearson&rsquo;s right-hand man. He was to Pearson what Harry Hopkins was to FDR. The one time he DID run for office Canadians soundly rejected him. He was also himself an immigrant. He convinced Pearson that flooding Toronto-Ontario with non-Whites and destroying its WASP-cultural base would pay big dividends down the road for the Liberals. He was Canada&rsquo;s Rasputin and a foreign-born one at that. Trudeau couldn&rsquo;t be happier to enforce the new immigration that Pearson-Kent cooked up. Trudeau was also an absolute catastrophe for Canada too. If anyone wants to learn more on this I suggest the books THE TROUBLE WITH CANADA and IMMIGRATION, THE DESTRUCTION OF ENGLISH CANADA. Also well worth a look is the website www.Canadafirst.net  </p>
