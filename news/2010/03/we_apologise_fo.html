<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For us it is a saddening sight  &mdash;  a magnificent bull elephant struck down in his old age.</p>
<p>But for the starving of Zimbabwe, it was little short of a miracle.</p>
<p>The carcass provided a vital source of food, and hundreds of desperate villagers in the Gonarezhou National Park descended on the dead animal within minutes of its discovery.</p>
<p>Using machetes, axes and knives made from tin cans they set upon the six-ton carcass, which was found deep in scrubland.</p>
<p>Fights broke out as villagers battled to strip chunks of flesh from the animal and drag them away to feed their families.</p>
<p>It took just one hour and 47 minutes for the 13ft-tall elephant to be reduced to a skeleton. Every part was used for food, even the trunk and ears.</p>
<p>The bones of the 70-year-old animal were taken to boil for soup and within 24 hours nothing was left but a blood-stained patch of earth.</p>
<p>The images are undeniably shocking. But they illustrate the terrible lengths to which Zimbabweans are forced to go just to survive under Robert Mugabe.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Red Cross warned the situation in the former British colony is &#8216;critical&rsquo; with 2.17million  &mdash;  one in four of the population  &mdash;  requiring urgent food aid.</p>
<p>Emma Kundishora, of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society, said: &#8216;In some parts of the country, the food situation is as bad as many of our volunteers and staff have ever seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Conditions are expected to deteriorate further this year following the collapse of agriculture caused by President Mugabe&rsquo;s violent seizures of thousands of white-owned farms since 2000.</p>
<p>Erratic rain has also damaged crops of corn. Harvests could produce just 500,000-tons this year, less than a third of the amount required to feed the nation.</p>
<p>Photographer David Chancellor said: &#8216;Just after dawn a villager spotted the carcass as he passed on a bicycle.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was in the middle of nowhere, but within 15 minutes hundreds of people had arrived from all directions.</p>
<p>&#8216;The women formed a ring around the elephant and the men stood inside, fighting and stabbing each other to get to the meat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;The meat was taken back to homes. Some was eaten immediately but most was dried on washing lines and stored to eat later.</p>
<p>&#8216;There were celebrations in the surrounding villages for the next two nights.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Yet another heartening story of black African rule in formerly colonial Africa.  Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) used to be called the &#8220;breadbasket of Africa&#8221; before that cartoonish lout Robert Mugabe set about dispossessing white farmers and awarding the land to ignorant natives who apparently knew nothing about farming, land management, or most probably anything at all relating to the post 4th Century Period.</p>
<p>Country after country in sub-Sahara is being destroyed after control is returned to the black African inhabitants, thus continuing the immutable pattern displayed in every village, town, municipality, city, state, and country in which blacks gain possession and political control.  This is an immutable social law of nature to which there are no exceptions anywhere in the world and of which there are ample examples right here in the USA, to include the current occupants of the White House.</p>

		<p>Please do not blame Robert Mugabe for the way these people are behaving. What do you think would happen when 6000 pounds of free meat was just found laying around. Do you think everyone would stand in line patiently for an equal part to eat. Do you think that the people would make sure  the people in most need of food would get the most. I am sure the strongest men got most of it and sold any excess for money or traded it for sex. Typical africans. Just remember how the police behaved after Katrina hit New Orleans.</p>

When people are starving, it&rsquo;s understandable to what lengths they will go to survive.</p>
<p>This goes to show the end result of black rule. </p>
<p>How often, under white rule, did these people have to resort to such means of survival?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing the Zimbabweans were able to rid themselves of the oppressive yoke of colonialism.  It looks like they&rsquo;ve built a better society for themselves in every way.<br>
The horrors of British rule: a prosperous economy, plentiful food, growing infrastructure, access to health services, minimal crime and the opportunity to improve their lot through education, must haunt their dreams at night.<br>
Of course, the legacy of colonialism will always be the scapegoat for every corrupt, incompetent, cruel, and just plain stupid third world dictator.<br>

		<p>When Zimbabwe was run by whites it was a prosperous, net exporter of food, the bread basket of Africa. Now it&rsquo;s a classic case study of what happens when uneducated Africans take over and totally ruin the country for everyone. Can anyone cite one instance of a productive, efficiently-run farm under black control?</p>
<p>Mugabe should be brought up on genocide charges&hellip;namely his own people, let alone the bloody carnage he&rsquo;s inflicted on white farmers, who have been evicted and mercilessly butchered.</p>
<p>Colonialism may have been unfair to the natives, but it was far better for them than what they now face.</p>

		<p>Looks like they&rsquo;ve gotten back to their roots.  This is what Africans did before they were touched by civilization.  No surprise here, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

		<p>Americans eat their game (deer, antelope, etc.) and Africans eat theirs. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Should you go on an elephant hunt, you will find that the only thing you take away are the tusks, which may be mounted on a fake elephant head. The natives follow you and cut the elephant up for food after you shoot it so nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p>If you go on any hunt in South Africa, all you get is the trophy; the meat goes to a slaughter house and is sold for food (to both whites and blacks). The only animal that humans do not eat are zebras, which the Zulu refuse to eat  &mdash;  and the white folk follow their example.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t see what the problem is here.  There is a lack of food.  Food becomes available so the locals go after it.</p>
<p>If americans were starving, and a deer dropped dead in the street, I suspect it would quickly be dragged back to someone&rsquo;s garage and field stripped (probably by someone with experience hunting and field dressing).</p>
<p>The difference is, they fight over it (I notice not much of that in the pictures).  Where I live (ie not a black neighborhood), the meat would most certainly be immediately distributed to the most needy.  I doubt a single adult would eat even a bite either.</p>
<p>And it is that difference which is why they are starving and we are not.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise I have is that so many went through the effort to harvest the elephant.  From what I know of zimbabwe, I would have expected it to rot away untouched by people so lazy they would rather starve to death then bother to get up and make a meal for themselves.</p>
<p>Understand something about zimbabwe&hellip;..the ground in many places is peppered with gold.  With a tiny amount of effort, the average person there could collect a small fortune and have hard currency in a place where that goes far indeed.</p>
<p>Few make the effort.</p>

<p>Game by definition is living animals hunted for meat, white people don&rsquo;t eat dead rotting withered carcasses found putrefying in the hot sun. </p>
<p>On the bright side this bounty will delay the onset of cannibalism by at least a day or two.</p>

		<p>Someday, when the lights go out on western civilization, China is going to decide it needs more land. The same government that killed 60 million of its own will surely have no problem exterminating the entire continent of Africa.

When the farms were handed over to the blacks they saw raw seed that could be sold, fruit trees that could be chopped down for firewood and could be sold, tractors that could be sold, fertilizer that could be sold, irrigation pipes that could be dug up and sold. </p>
<p>with all the cash they ran out and bought food and fancy clothes, nice hats. but a few years later&hellip; after all the blacks did exactly the same thing&hellip; there was no longer any food to buy</p>

		<p>This article reminds me of the scary pictures, published in the British press just before the Copenhagen Climate Circus, of polar bears forced to eat their young to avoid starvation.  Of course, male polar bears have always killed cubs whenever they could, which is why you never see photos of happy polar bear families with daddy bear and mommy bear and little baby polar bears. Mommy knows she has to keep the cubs away from daddy. Even though he&rsquo;s white.</p>
<p>Similarly, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Africans are carrion eaters.  They would have done exactly the same thing in Ian Smith&rsquo;s day, I expect.</p>
<p>The real tragedy of Africa won&rsquo;t be evident until the supply of free food from the West dries up.  When Africans are forced to grow or hunt their own food, they will strip the continent of everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies (well, maybe except snakes; Africans are terrified of snakes). They can do it easily - Africa is awash with arms. The survivors will starve.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s shocking about this?  They didn&rsquo;t kill the animal, they just found it dead while it was still fresh. It&rsquo;s free food, which would have rotted very quickly unless other scavengers got to it first.  A gift from the gods that shouldn&rsquo;t go to waste.  </p>
<p>My guess is the locals would have done much the same even if they weren&rsquo;t starving.    </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to correct you, but what do you try to say with post 4th Century?<br>
Before the 4th Century the Romans built their empire in which farming was totally well managed. The Greeks build up their empire even earlier. The Chinese build up their Empire 5000 years ago.<br>
We are not talking about 1600 years difference. We are talking about 100 000 years of difference. 1600 years of difference would mean, they would be as civilized as Romans.</p>

		<p>The scary part of this story is that the United States would also deteriorate quickly into a wasteland if it was run by blacks.  To me it is surreal that a black man is president of this country.  This country was founded and created by white brain power.  Nothing more, nothing less.  This country is rapidly running on nothing but yet pretending there is still endless money in the bank.  This country is finished when the whites increasing become the minority.    </p>

<p>Having spent my life trying to educate urban youths, it seems that I also need to educate you city slickers.</p>
<p>In Kansas (I betray my roots), it is estimated that 80% of the deer killed die in deer-vehicle accidents. They do not all go to waste. The local sheriffs have lists of people who want these deer (there is usually a waiting list). They issue a salvage tag so that a person can take the carcass. So white people do eat &ldquo;carrion�?, if that is what you want to call it.</p>
<p>The difference between the way it is done in Africa vs. here is that we don&rsquo;t fight over it, but have an organized way of dealing with the situation. That is the difference between us and Africa.</p>

<p>Totally agree with you.</p>
<p>China has a patriotic (if they would be white I would say racist) government. The government have now many Chinese companies in Africa. And in the companies only Chinese people are working. Furthermore Chinese security people are their with guns to protect the companies. </p>
<p>And if they were able to shoot on their own people who just wanted more democracy, they will shoot on black people wanting to robbery too. Then it will be just a question of time till they colonialise it.</p>
<p>I mean, why shouldn&rsquo;t they do it? </p>
<p>They have in their own country a One-Child-Politic. They can easily say, make more children and spread out. What could weak whites say, if China say &#8220;you did the same with Indians in America&#8221;.</p>

<p>Because of the same reasons some whites blame Jews.<br>
They see Jews in good positions. They see Jews are overrepresented in the media. So they same Jews are responsible for the liberal ideas.</p>
<p>Black and liberal see whites are overrepresented in good positions and are rich. They are running most schools. So black people and liberals blame whites for &#8220;anti black schools&#8221;.</p>
<p>But if they one side would see that ALL black areas are doing bad and the other side would see that nearly ALL media is politically correct - even in Europe where there aren&rsquo;t many Jews in the media - they would stop blaming &#8220;the evil whites/Jews&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Reply to Urban Teacher:</p>
<p>When Kenya abolished sport hunting in 1977, massive poaching decimated Kenya&rsquo;s wildlife because without the funds from sport hunting, there were far fewer funds to pay game wardens.</p>
<p>In South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, and other African countries that still have trophy hunting, I would much rather have some of the elephants, white rhinos, lions, leopards, various antlelope species, and other African wildlife, get taken in ecologically sustainable trophy hunts.  Than let the animal-rights idiots abolish sport hunting and force the local African villagers into <br>
poaching all of Africa&rsquo;s wildlife into extinction and destroying the remaining wildlife habitat, in order to survive.</p>
<p>In Africa, wildlife has to have an economic value in order to save it from extinction.  If India, shortly after winning independence from Brtain. had started a system of sustainably letting trophy hunters take a few of the local tigers, and the profits going to help the local villagers, the now seriously endangered tiger would be a flourishing species, instead.</p>
<p>I am not a hunter, myself, but here in America, I find it outrageous and unacceptable that hunters of deer, elk, moose and other game, are just as stupid and ignorant about Africa as the animal-rights idiots and anti-hunters, because they openly speak out against trophy hunting in Africa.  These ignorant, self-righteous hunters have not taken the time to study the wildlife situation in Africa, much less even take the time to actually visit Africa, and find out for themsleves how absolutely necessary sport hunting is for the survival of Africa&rsquo;s wildlife!</p>
<p>I do not understand why the Zulus and even white people will not eat zebra meat.  I would give anything to eat a nice juicy zebra steak!</p>

<p>Why do you say if the Chinese regime were white, you would call them racist? The Chinese aren&rsquo;t racist in their own right? Every race has its prejudices, mister.</p>
<p>Having said that, I opined on other past posts about Zimbabwe, that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s people would compete with Zimbabwe&rsquo;s non-human scavengers for food. That day arrived sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s people will soon be devouring rats, mice, cockroaches, beetles, flies and bugs - if they aren&rsquo;t already doing so.</p>
<p>No aid to Zimbabwe. Let a hundred flowers bloom on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s grave. Let a hundred jackals contest over her remains.</p>

That is a VERY good point, I think.  Altruism seems to be a white characteristic.  Only white people are so concerned and solicitous about the welfare of other races. </p>
<p>Asians couldn&rsquo;t care less.  Not even about their own.  In India, Indians don&rsquo;t even care about other Indians.  I have read that many Indians are glad that AIDS is killing so many, because that will leave more space for the rest. They even oppose government efforts to help!</p>

<p>Had no idea people ate roadkill, you learn something everyday I guess! However eating a dear struck down by a car doesn&rsquo;t seem unwholesome to me in my mind that is no different than hunted meat, whereas eating a dead animal felled by old age or disease seems disgusting.</p>

		<p>I remember about twenty years ago&hellip; all the righteous indignation and hand ringing over the evil white rule in South Africa and Rhodesia&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad to say I never bought into it and my suspicion..(unpopular at the time) proved correct. I&rsquo;m sure there was an ugliness to that system (what system is perfect?) but I&rsquo;ll bet the blacks wish it were still in existence. And then there was the save the world thing for all the starving blacks also ($$$ channeled to black war lords)&hellip; Its so easy to be a righteous hero from a distance and for a couple days. But warm and fuzzy feelings have a way of reaping evil dividends in reality. And why aren&rsquo;t these warm fuzzy hero&rsquo;s concerned over the horrors commited against the white farmers?</p>

<p>Some discussion has already taken place in official places about the building competition between China and India.  And it has been discussed on a few tv political talk shows in the past.  In fact, India is trying to upgrade its military against a percieved growing Chinese threat.  Remember that they both have nuclear arms and a lot less sense than Russians and the former managers of America.</p>

<p>15 John: &ldquo;I wonder that India doesn&rsquo;t have its sights on Africa too. They could use the land as much as the Chinese could, and they&rsquo;re a lot closer. Either country could, of course, just shove the Africans aside.�? <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting speculation.  Unlike the Chinese, there were already many Indian settlers living in Africa, some for generations. Most were business owners, some of them very wealthy.  Back around the 70&rsquo;s, these people were being expelled outright from Uganda, and put under heavy pressure elsewhere to get out. African nationalism was raging: &#8220;Africa for Africans!&#8221;  India, to my knowledge, did nothing to help them&hellip; nor did it even take them back (many went instead to Britain and Canada). </p>
<p>If that were to happen today, I wonder if India would be so passive.  It wouldn&rsquo;t have to be.  The simple fact is that India could brush aside those African countries with a feather, and simply overwhelm them with a few hundred million Indians   &mdash;  - if it wished. </p>
<p>India needs the space (and resources), and all that empty, unused space is lying right there&hellip;temptingly close to them. And in a climate that Indians could relate to. </p>
<p>At present, the world order probably would object to any aggression on India&rsquo;s (or China&rsquo;s) part. But if the world order falters and breaks down, then it will be a free for all, and Africa will be up for grabs.  Africa itself will look like that elephant being carved up by the voracious mob.  Africans will regret that they no longer have any beneficent whites there to protect them from the predators.</p>

&#8220;Game by definition is living animals hunted for meat, white people don&rsquo;t eat dead rotting withered carcasses found putrefying in the hot sun.&#8221;    AJ </p>
<p><br>
As I wrote in another post which apparently failed to go through, there are Americans who most definitely DO eat roadkill.  There are even recipe books for it. It by no means includes just deer. It&rsquo;s armadillos, possums, squirrels &hellip; I won&rsquo;t go on.</p>
<p>One example:http://user.pa.net/~nrwing/recipes.html<br>
a quote:  &#8220;(TIP: 3 day old roadkill is more tender and<br>
easier to skin)&#8221;<br>

<p>Yes, I had to explain to some of my teaching colleagues that trophy hunting in Africa is good for the people and for the wildlife. Some seemed to understand.</p>
<p>BTW, When I was asked at one faculty party why I hunted, I blurted out that &#8220;Some of us prefer not to use hired killers to get our food&#8221;. It turned out to be a convincing argument in that case.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know why the Zulu don&rsquo;t eat zebras, but I guess the whites figure that if it&rsquo;s not good enough for the Zulu, then it&rsquo;s not good enough for them.</p>
<p>Zebras are closely related to horses and we don&rsquo;t eat horses here, although I have reason to believe that I was once served it at a fancy restaurant out West (it was good).</p>

		<p>Under Colorado state law, motorists are entitled to keep any wildlife they kill in traffic accidents - if you hit a deer, you&rsquo;re basically paying for the meat with the repair bill for your vehicle.</p>
<p>That elephant probably died of old age.  Not many African animals do, but a mature bull elephant doesn&rsquo;t have any natural enemies.  The real trouble with disease begins when people there butcher and eat dead primates.  A major ebola outbreak near Kikwit in the Congo started when locals found a dead chimpanzee and ate it.  There isn&rsquo;t much you can catch from an elephant, provided the meat is adequately cooked (and the parasite load in herbivores is minimal anyway), but a chimp is a different story - they&rsquo;re simply so closely related to us that anything a chimp has is certain to be something a human can catch.</p>
