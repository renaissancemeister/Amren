			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, Federation for American Immigration Reform, March 1, 2010 [scroll down]</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The nation&rsquo;s top civil rights prosecutor last week blatantly misrepresented FBI crime statistics by claiming that hate crimes against Latinos are on the rise.  Mr. Thomas Perez, who took over the Justice Department&rsquo;s civil rights unit for the Obama Administration, said last Wednesday, &#8220;The data and my own experience is that hate crimes are on the rise: Hate crimes against every group are on the rise.&#8221;  (Seattle Post-Intelligencer, February 25, 2010).  According to the Seattle Intelligencer, Perez then expressed particular concern that hate crimes directed at Latinos are on the rise  and that Hispanic leaders and organizations are receiving threats, in his opinion, &#8220;because they had the audacity to stand up for immigration reform.&#8221;  (Id.). </p>
<p>The remarks Perez made are controversial because the most recent FBI hate crime data for 2008 directly contradict them and Mr. Perez provided no other source to back up his claims. The 2008 FBI hate crime data, released in November 2009, show that in all four categories regarding hate crimes against Hispanics, there was a significant drop from the previous year.  (FBI 2008 Hate Crimes Report).  Specifically:</p>
<p>* Anti-Hispanic incidents fell 6%</p>
<p>* Anti-Hispanic offenses fell 5%</p>
<p>* Victims of anti-Hispanic incidents fell 4.6%; and</p>
<p>* Known offenders against Hispanics fell 6.2%</p>
<p>In making his statement, Mr. Perez disregarded these statistics and instead cited an incident of a man sending threatening emails to leaders of the National Council of La Raza as anecdotal evidence. (Id.). </p>
<p>Mr. Perez has long pledged to make prosecuting hate crimes a top priority, noting last fall that he &#8220;spent the better part of a decade prosecuting hate-crime cases.&#8221;  (The Washington Post, December 22, 2009).  Indeed, Perez served as a deputy assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice from 1988 to 1999.  He previously served as Special Counsel to the late Senator Ted Kennedy and advised him on matters related to civil rights, criminal justice, and constitutional issues.  (White House Press Release, March 13, 2009).  During his time at the Department of Justice, Mr. Perez began volunteering for CASA de Maryland, a taxpayer funded organization affiliated with the National Council of La Raza that advocates amnesty and provides assistance to illegal and legal aliens throughout Maryland.  After leaving Justice at the end of the Clinton administration he became president of CASA de Maryland&rsquo;s Board of Directors in 2002. He was Maryland&rsquo;s labor secretary when President Obama appointed him to the civil rights post.</p>
<p>Mr. Perez&rsquo;s experience as a federal prosecutor makes his statement regarding hate crime data particularly troubling. Most would assume that an experienced prosecutor would know that the latest available data does not support the charge that hate crimes against Latinos are on the rise.  This has led some to question not only the veracity of Mr. Perez&rsquo;s statements, but the political motivation behind them.<br>

		<p>I find Senor Perez&rsquo;s statement troubling because it clearly indicates that he is a prevaricator - moreover, one who will lie to benefit &#8220;his&#8221; own people at the expense of others.  I don&rsquo;t think somebody like that belongs in the position of top civil rights prosecutor.</p>

		<p>The only way to make these insane policies sound rational is to misrepresent facts and lie.This administrations&rsquo; ongoing lies and half-truths are directed at whites and only white genocide.</p>

		<p>FAIR ought to know as well as anyone that the FBI Hate Crimes report is bogus from top to bottom.   More than just racist against whites and dishonest, it&rsquo;s a low-level war-crime that significantly contributes to racist violence against whites ( including rape and murder)  on the streets of America.  It  provides a fig leaf that allows the media and government to turn a blind eye to the massive amount of racist violence against whites,  helps prevent any discussion on the topic, and allows the government to not take any action on that violence.   Every FBI and Justice Department employee involved in it ought to be arrested and charged under the same  international war-crimes protocols that Rwandan radio broadcasters were arrested under. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure this even matters.  Our government is so far away from even a hint of clarity or honesty about racial violence that one more hypocrisy, distortion or lie doesn&rsquo;t even beging to scratch the surface.</p>
<p>This is a good example.  So what that hate crimes against &#8220;hispanics&#8221; have gone down.  The important thing is the REASON they have gone down&hellip;.which is that mexicans and south americans have ethnically cleansed blacks from most communities they used to co-habitate.</p>
<p>That is a level of racist violence and balkanization going on this the US that nobody&hellip;.I mean NOBODY is willing to admit to.  Hate crimes went down?  They went up?  Who cares.  There are large parts of the US where people of a different race simply aren&rsquo;t allowed anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not &#8220;crime&#8221; anymore.  That is something else.</p>

		<p>Well, this IS the same group, the DOJ, who dropped all charges against black militant thugs with riot sticks intimidating white voters at Philadelphia voting places.  Actual hate crimes, and federal crimes of interfering with voting get dropped.  But imagined crimes, totally fictitious, are trumpeted by Obama&rsquo;s latest stooge.  Man, can he pick em, or can he pick em?</p>

		<p>Here is a man who is sworn to defend the Constitution, which he clearly is not doing.  He is more interested in supporting &#8220;his people.&#8221;  This is what we have come to expect in the corrupt Obama administraion.</p>

		<p>Anti Hispanic hate crimes should have risen tenfold over the last decade just to keep it in proportion with the increased Hispanic population. Since they have not it is proof that America is becoming far more welcoming to all and sundry than ever before.</p>

		<p>Even if Perez is called out on his obvious race baiting, he will say the same thing they all say when they are caught distorting the facts (or lying outright): &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it isn&rsquo;t true, because it raises awarness to the issue,&#8221; and the left will nod their heads in agreement.</p>
<p>I would like to know what race the suspects were in the hate crimes that did occur against hispanics.  The fact that this detail was omitted infers that the suspects were white.  I would bet cold hard cash that in the vast majority of these incidents, the suspects were black.</p>
