<h1><a href="http://fredoneverything.net/AmRenDetroit.shtml">American Renaissance: Racists or Diagnosticians?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Freed Reed, Fred On Everything, March 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racism is in bad odor among the virtuous. I wonder why. At least, I wonder why any discussion of race is thought to be racism. The United States faces grave racial problems  &mdash;  more accurately, has them but doesn&rsquo;t face them. Refusal to acknowledge their existence is not productive: Few problems are solved by forbidding their mention. The question should not be whether views are racist, but whether they are wrong. </p>
<p>The American Renaissance, run by Jared Taylor, is quite racist in the poorly thought out and sniffish sense prevalent today. AmRen (as it is generally known) has recently gotten much bad press because it holds all manner of views whose mention results in pack attack by our arbiters of What Can Be Discussed: For example, that blacks commit violent crime at far higher rates than do whites, that massive immigration from Latin America offers no advantages to the United States but a great many evils, that affirmative action lowers the competence of government, the universities, and schools in general  &mdash;  and so on.</p>
<p>These ideas are no doubt racist, yes. Unpleasant, yes. But  &mdash;  are they wrong?</p>
<p>I would prefer to think so. It gives me no pleasure and little hope to hear that black schools regularly produce functional illiterates, that the schools of Detroit and of the nation&rsquo;s capital and for that matter of wherever blacks predominate are disasters, that savage beatings of whites by gangs of blacks are common and hidden by the media. That these things happen is of no advantage to me. I would be delighted to see blacks and Hispanics excelling academically. I would like to walk the streets of American cities without carefully noting pigmentation, which we all do and pretend we don&rsquo;t. While I like Jared personally, I would like to tell him that his racial ideas were all wrong.</p>
<p>But are they? </p>
<p>On AmRen&rsquo;s web site you find news stories, taken chiefly from the respectable publications, that in aggregate paint a grim picture of things racial in America. Can you show these to be in error, isolated instances, not representative of a larger reality? I hope so. But I can&rsquo;t. Almost everything I read at AmRen well describes reality as I have seen it.  And also as all cops have seen it, though telling what they know is a firing offense.</p>
<p>What we have is an ongoing catastrophe, documentable, indeed documented repeatedly but never openly examined. An apparent amicability is enforced by heavy federal pressure, by a press that censors itself, and by that poisonous fog that we call political correctness.</p>
<p><br>
But consider. From the <em>Detroit News</em>, a story on the illiteracy of the president of the school board, as illustrated by his emails:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you saw Sunday&rsquo;s <em>Free Press</em> that shown Robert Bobb the emergency financial manager for Detroit Public Schools, move Mark Twain to Boynton which have three times the number seats then students and was one of the reason&rsquo;s he gave for closing school to many empty seats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>&#8220;Do DPS control the Foundation or outside group? If an outside group control the foundation, then what is DPS Board row with selection of is director? Our we mixing DPS and None DPS row&rsquo;s, and who is the watch dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>The president of the school board? Confusing &#8220;our&#8221; for &#8220;are&#8221;? My daughters had better grammar at the age of three. A city that has such a man in such a position has no place in a civilized country.</p>
<p>Below the surface of the ominous calm lies massive anger. Hostility to affirmative action runs rampant, whether against female firemen who can&rsquo;t handle hoses or black teachers who can&rsquo;t spell. The number of people who would happily run illegal immigrants from the country at gun point is huge. When the races are not forced together, they separate like oil and water. The forcing is national policy. It has not proved a recipe for domestic happiness.</p>
<p>The tendency toward segregation equally  among the smugly correct and the contents of Joe&rsquo;s Bar. Many years back, the <em>Washingtonian</em>, the vaguely heterosexual coffee-table magazine of the District of Columbia, checked on how many of the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s news room sent their shiny white children to the city&rsquo;s black public schools. Zero. At the first evidence of fertility the town house on upper Connecticut goes on the block and another pair of liberal diversity-friendly Democrats bail for the albino warrens of Montgomery County. Yet the <em>Post</em> honks and blows most mightily against racial discrimination.</p>
<p>How does this mandated hypocrisy help find a solution to racial woes  &mdash;  if there is a solution? It doesn&rsquo;t. I suspect that a prime reason for the current uneasy stasis is exactly that people have concluded that there can be no solution. The best thing is to hold the lid on and let future generations worry about it.</p>
<p>Suppose that you genuinely want the best for what are quietly called Permanently Disadvantaged Minorities, and you therefore suggest that officials, to include teachers, whose English is below the level of second grade be dismissed. God help you. You will be called a racist, elitist, cultural imperialist, and insensitive, and lose your job. Why bother? All you can do as a responsible parent is to move away from the crime, to put your children in the whitest schools you can find, on the principle that most whites can still read. This of course perpetuates the problem.</p>
<p>The same foetor of impossibility engulfs any effort at change. If you try to end the calculated recruitment of incompetence that is affirmative action, you eliminate a large part of the black middle class (such as the above-mentioned  president of Detroit&rsquo;s school board) and hell breaks loose. What do you do?</p>
<p>Nothing. Which is what we are doing. It is what we will continue to do.</p>
<p>The folk at the American Renaissance? They don&rsquo;t offer much in the way of solutions, but I don&rsquo;t fault them for this since I can&rsquo;t offer a solution either. Anything that might work is politically impossible, and anything that is politically possible won&rsquo;t work. It may be that nothing would work.</p>
<p>Are Jared Taylor and his fellows wrong in their description of the disease? Let&rsquo;s hope. But I fear they aren&rsquo;t. Whether, or that, they are racists doesn&rsquo;t matter. Oncologists recognize cancer. They don&rsquo;t necessarily like it.</p>
<p>AmRen would be easy to dismiss if it were a pack of bedraggled Nazis ranting about how Jews sacrifice Christian children. But it isn&rsquo;t, which is why it is disturbing. Normally a story like the foregoing tale from Detroit appears locally and is carefully, carefully not picked up nationally. The race of criminals is usually suppressed. The &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; in schools gets occasional mention, but the gravity of the situation does not. Thus AmRen, aggregating these news stories without apology, constitutes a form of intellectual blunt trauma.</p>
<p>But is AmRen wrong?<br>

		<p>Absolutely not, Fred.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good reason why the countries these minorities originate from are Third World, even in the 21st century.  And, we all know the reasons without opening a book or asking an expert.</p>
<p>Oh, and Fred, it appears to me that you, too, tiptoe around the obvious realities of current-day American life when it comes to the negative effects of minorities and multiculturalism.  You already know the answer yet you still &#8216;sheepishly&rsquo; ask &#8220;But is AmRen wrong?&#8221;  It takes a brave man or woman to say no and Amren&rsquo;s loyal fans shout a resounding NO!!!<br>

		<p>How is objecting to affirmative action racist? Oh, I know those in any position of power do their best to insinuate that being against affirmative action is racist - even connect it to &#8216;white supremacy&rsquo;, but it doesn&rsquo;t make it racism. </p>
<p>I admire Fred, but here he sounds too much like the liberals - at least with going on about wanting what&rsquo;s best for blacks. </p>

We should fight race hustlers by using these facts. Whenever we have a chance we should urge them to prove that they&rsquo;re not hypocrites by moving their families into black ghettos. They all say black crime is just a stereotype, a myth, so they shouldn&rsquo;t have any problem living there. They also shouldn&rsquo;t have any problem sending their children to black schools. When Mr. Taylor speaks to race hustlers he could bring this subject up and embarrass them. Those hypocrites should be exposed for what they are. This will destroy their credibility. I bet none of them would be willing to move their family into a black ghetto. People love their children more than anything else in the world and aren&rsquo;t prepared to expose them to danger for anything. At the moment being a race hustler is a very easy job. Those hypocrites only talk the talk but never walk the walk.  What we have to do is make the business of race hustling a very difficult one, so they realize that it&rsquo;s not worth it. Mr. Taylor could also make a Youtube video on this subject in which he would dare (specific)race hustlers to lead by example and move their families into black ghettos. Why should only poorer Whites be required to live with non-Whites?! Why should only poorer Whites be forced to suffer for the socialization of non-Whites?!</p>

		<p>I cast my lot in with those who want what is best for their own kin. Let others fight their battles with their own resources. I hope Mr. Reed is close to the tipping point in his psychological equilibrium, and what is clearly roiling his mind soon spills out. Better for him, and better for us. Let the rest see to their best interests, if they can.</p>

<p>Well, at least Mr. Reed has the guts to admit that while what we know to be the truth about the American racial crisis, is unpleasant for him to accept emotionally, it is the reality of the situation. This country is being invaded by criminal aliens, who simply want to feed off of a host; internal &ldquo;underprivileged minorities&rdquo; are no better, if not worse; and the Marxist plutocrats who &ldquo;govern&rdquo; us, care nothing about rectifying the situation so long as they gain more power and wealth. In fact, these delusional elites, seem to take an oddly sadomasochistic pleasure in the whole rampage of &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; that they have unleashed against reality and the poor white taxpayers who must dwell in it. </p>
<p>Moreover, their beneath idiotic slogans such as: &ldquo;diversity is our strength,&rdquo; and &ldquo;multiculturalism enriches us all,&rdquo;  are self-consciously selected mantras designed mostly to hide their own insecurities about their nebulous role in the coming &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; future, that they have so arrogantly spawned. Like truculent pubescent delinquents, who have stolen their parents&rsquo; car, they only accelerate when control is being lost, and on the wrong side of the highway they are now swerving on.</p>
<p>What more to say, other than, God help us all!<br>

<p>There are races of people and there are differences between the races, which can be ascribed to genetics or culture, but the differences are real&hellip;.not imaginary. </p>
<p>Should these differences be noted or discussed? Of course. </p>

		<p> Of course AmRen is &#8220;not wrong.&#8221; AmRen points out the symptoms of the disease, and allows its bloggers to, hopefully, suggest an occasional remedy. It does not tolerate racial slurs or other unacceptable speech from its readers/bloggers, and as a result I think most of those who would gladly post such language stay away   &mdash;   from the blogging, at least.</p>
<p> Fred Reed has written an excellent analysis of America&rsquo;s racial plight   &mdash;   one that you would never see in any of the mainstream media, and which you probably will not see re-printed anywhere but here. He says repeatedly that he hopes various negative things suggested by AmRen-chosen articles about minorities are not true   &mdash;   then says he fears that they are.</p>
<p> But think of it this way   &mdash;   until it gets bad enough to make us scream, &#8220;ENOUGH!!!&#8221; and try to do whatever we can do to reverse it, the rot will continue. That&rsquo;s why AmRen should be recognized as a national treasure   &mdash;   for holding a mirror up to a national reality far too many Americans would prefer to ignore.</p>

		<p>Getting most people to face race honestly is about as likely to occur as getting a theist to examine their unsupported faith based beliefs honestly. It just isn&rsquo;t going to happen. Only so many of us are willing to be honest about things like God and race. I forget who said it but it is true - One will not be swayed by reason whose beliefs were adopted absent of reason in the first place.</p>

<p>Oballa has us by the bams. He is literally, by force of will (and God knows what else)  herding White congressmen, like they were cattle, to do unethical and highly questionable things in his obsessive rush to government healthcare.</p>
<p>And after that, I would not be surprised if he herded them into voting for complete and universal amnesty for illegals.</p>

		<p>This is going to be an extremely slow boat to China.  The situation that AmRen recognizes and all its followers recognize should be recognizable to every intelligent White man, woman and child.  This article is only scratching the surface.  The writer has to give credence to AmRen and Jared Taylor very hesitatingly lest he appear &#8220;racist&#8221;.  How long will it take for the brainwashed masses to awake from their media-induced stupor?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Fred Reed&rsquo;s columns for about five years.  He is always thoughtful and provocative.</p>
<p>My understanding of his career is that he was a journalist who wrote for police magazines, and as such, he would ride around in squad cars in all sorts of seedy venues, such as Chicago&rsquo;s South side or the dregs of D.C.  Mr. Reed has seen it all, literally.  You can verify this for yourself at his website, www.fredoneverything.com.</p>
<p>Another aspect of Mr. Reed&rsquo;s life is the fact that he is married to a Mexican lady, with whom he has a daughter, and presently living in Mexico.</p>
<p>I like Fred Reed&rsquo;s writing, and I respect him.</p>

		<p>Fred, I applaud your article overall, but your fear of being called a racist is apparent in your writing. You walk the tightrope of hinting that Amren might be right on substantive issues, while at the same time hinting Amren might be racist, as though that will protect you from anyone that might attack you as racist for your mild support of Amren.</p>

<p>No it is not racist to assert that affirmative action lowers the competencey level.  It is just a fact.  </p>
<p>In addition, AA is blatantly unfair since it rewards so many who know nothing of past discrimination at the expense of those who did nothing to be punished.  </p>
<p>AA is just a political tool used to split white males against everyone else.  The Democrats promise three-fourths of the population (everyone except straight-white-males) the rewards of aa.  Even when a white male struggles and starts a business, he will then be accosted by some government bureaucrat asking how many minorities he will hire.  </p>
<p>Look at any political contest and you will see candidates appearing before black organizations, Hispanic organizations, womens groups, etc.  And what do you think they are talking about? Global warming?  No, they invariably talk about affirmative action programs geared toward those groups.  And now the Republicans are joining in and supporting aa.  </p>

		<p>I have no disagreement with anything Fred says but I would caution that AR&rsquo;s focus on race is a focus on the tip of a bigger iceberg.  The BW IQ difference in North America is 15 pts, the gap between manual workers and professional Whites is 30 pts.  Social class promises to be the _real_ headache, trumping race.</p>
<p>For example no one would care about illegal immigration at all if it were nanotech engineers and  radiologists trooping across the border, but sadly it is not.</p>
<p>I am essentially saying what the authors of The Bell Curve said, but their message got lost in the whining and hair pulling about what the said about race.</p>

		<p>Three quotes I&rsquo;ve recently heard remind me of the current situation&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In dictatorships, you need courage to fight evil; in the free world, you need courage to see the evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the interest of the weak to design societies that cripple the strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Civilizations die from suicide, not by murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course we are right, but that is not enough these days.<br>
Impossible, empty,&rsquo;feel good&rsquo;, promise filled rhetoric by wind bag, pseudo actors is the name of the day.</p>
<p>The truth is relative to the audience, who are demographically changing or who are being convinced that they are all persecuted minorities or at least should be fighting for them.<br>
This new status quo needs a bogeyman who are the invisible, evil &#8216;mainstream majority.&rsquo;<br>
The White middle class gets to pay the debt for the rich White upper class who are using non Whites and liberal politics against us.<br>
They need an enemy and we are it and we&rsquo;re either too brave or silly to keep our heads in.<br>
Strangely most individuals I speak to are the same page, but once a few more people come along that group hypnosis kicks in. <br>
Who wants to be alienated from the group?</p>
<p>We can never be portrayed as being justified or reasonable.<br>
Amren must be kept in that dark ignorant place, with ideas so unfathomable that they can not or should not even be considered or addressed.  <br>
In terms of needing a scapegoat though if we were not here, they&rsquo;d have to create us.</p>

		<p>The thing is, without a solution, no-one /can/ admit it. To admit it means it&rsquo;s official, means you can act on it. Means you can now discriminate, give IQ tests for jobs, all sorts. The social tension would increase, the oil-and-water would get worse. It might well be worse for Whites even; Blacks would feel more under threat, attempt less to integrate and be closer to open war (not /at/, mind you). Think of the consequences yourself; you know it wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like someone farting in polite company - everyone knows someone farted but you pretend nothing happened, so that ppl don&rsquo;t devolve to fart jokes and the farter doesn&rsquo;t get embarrassed. Enduring the smell is much the lesser of the evils. </p>
<p>The only problem is, as we get litigious and don&rsquo;t use &#8220;Well everyone&rsquo;s equal&#8221; just as a fig leaf and don&rsquo;t look too closely, but instead insist on equal outcomes, you put focus and pressure on the problem and, the truth. So, the fart-ignoring strategy is out, and I think there&rsquo;ll be increased ugliness ahead. Thanks lawyers, and activists. </p>

These are but a FRACTION of my personal favorites, juicy targets aren&rsquo;t they.

However, there is nothing wrong with the ideas of American Renaissance. Jared Taylor speaks the bold truth &mdash; even though the facts are detested by many.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #2, you are misreading Fred Reed.  He&rsquo;s not saying that objecting to affirmative action is racist.  He&rsquo;s saying that the usual political, media, and academic liberals will say that objection to affirmative action is racist.  Obviously, by any objective criteria, affirmative action itself is racist.</p>
<p>Fred Reed is one of the best writers on the web.  But the web doesn&rsquo;t pay so be sure to buy his books.</p>
<p><i>AmRen would be easy to dismiss if it were a pack of bedraggled Nazis ranting about how Jews sacrifice Christian children. But it isn&rsquo;t, which is why it is disturbing.</i></p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="http://www.jewishdefense.org/" rel="nofollow">Jewish Defense Organization</a> clearly believes that Amren, which has always welcomed Jewish attendees, and has had Jewish speakers, is a Nazi organization.  (The confused people of the JDO also believe that Nobel prize winner William Shockley was a Nazi, simply because he recognized the reality of differences in average IQ among races.)</p>

<p>We AmRen posters assertively preach to the choir while Mr. Reed&rsquo;s delicate approach might be more effective at reaching our potential allies who recognize racial truth but feel isolated and powerless to say or do anything about it.</p>
<p>At the very least, this piece is free publicity for Jared Taylor and American Renaissance.  We should welcome the objective exposure!</p>

		<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for this AM website most of us wouldn&rsquo;t be reading any of these stories in our local newspapers.  The Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune act like there is no such thing as reverse discrimination, racial set-asides for minorities, and the negative effects of affirmative action policies on white males.  One never reads anything about this subject in the &#8216;Letters to the Editor&rsquo; sections of either newspaper.  Blacks and Hispanics in Chicago make up most of those employed by the City, State, and Federal governments.  These are great jobs with better than average pay and benefits, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to register on the average white male that he has been excluded from these positions by the elites who run these various agencies.  How do you get the message across to these people? I don&rsquo;t know.  I&rsquo;ve had many arguments with my peers about this subject.  For one thing, the City of Chicago no longer prints its annual budget in the Chicago Tribune.  If they did, the citizens would get a good look at the salaries that their taxes pay these job holders.  Maybe that might wake them up.  Until we get political representation that looks out for the interests of the white race in this country I&rsquo;m afraid we face a losing proposition.  Most of our politicians in office here in Illinois are Liberal Democrats or Republicans and are trying to win the Hispanic and Black voters.</p>

<p>Schools and workplaces with &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; do discuss discrimination. It seems the more they discriminate against white men the more the public face must be that it is white men who are discriminating, and that it&rsquo;s wrong and evil. It&rsquo;s simply about making sure no one&rsquo;s feeling are hurt. At least anyone who counts as a person.  </p>

		<p>Radigarius #19: <i>I have no disagreement with anything Fred says but I would caution that AR&rsquo;s focus on race is a focus on the tip of a bigger iceberg. The BW IQ difference in North America is 15 pts, the gap between manual workers and professional Whites is 30 pts. Social class promises to be the _real_ headache, trumping race.</i></p>
<p><i>For example no one would care about illegal immigration at all if it were nanotech engineers and radiologists trooping across the border, but sadly it is not.</i></p>
<p><i>I am essentially saying what the authors of The Bell Curve said, but their message got lost in the whining and hair pulling about what the said about race.</i></p>
<p>If you figure that the typical manual laborer has an IQ of 90 - 95 and the typical white collar worker has an IQ of 120 - 125 it is indeed the case that the white collar/manual laborer IQ gap is twice the size of the white/black IQ gap.  However, we do not have affirmative action programs that reserve engineering jobs for brick layers.  We do not have our academic institutions saying that the reason the white lawn care guy did not become a mathematician is because of institutional racism.  Our society even now is willing to accept the natural divisions of talent that exist within a single race.  It&rsquo;s the natural division of talent across races that causes our politicians, academics, and media pundits to tie themselves into knots, and demand one horrid social policy after another.</p>
<p>Also, the absolute level of IQ matters.  We have no small number of white career criminals, murderers, thieves, and ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.  Most of these come from the bottom third of the white IQ spectrum.  But the proportion of blacks in that same IQ range is far larger, so they cause a lot more crime and trouble.  The left is well aware of the high proportion of blacks in prison, and blames this on institutional racism.  We know better, and in our own defense, have a right to get our message out.<br>

		<p>Question Diversity (#8) &#8220;Other than the fact that the solutions to the problems discussed on AR are self-evident, I disagree with Mr. Reed: There are a lot of solutions and positive public policy proposals, not to mention social and cultural calls, given among AR regulars.&#8221;</p>
<p>QD&rsquo;s issue logically relates to a question that is also approached by subsequent posters.  Can we really make a difference??  I&rsquo;m fairly certain that every AmRenner WANTS to make changes to help the White race, but we are often left with the elusive &#8220;How?&#8221; part of the two-tiered question.  Reading about atrocities and silliness in articles every day on this Website is intellectually stimulating, and some might say comforting, but it does very little to help our cause.  It is nice to support AmRen with money and attempt to win potential converters (#28 white advocate-canada), but is there really much hope?  I will continue to support AmRen in any way possible and that includes looking for potential new followers.  At the same time, I find it hard to ignore the all-too-likely validity of the &#8220;doom and gloom&#8221; scenarios that are mentioned in almost all of the posts by our friends ranger and ice.  I fear that they are right in that the USA and White race are both rapidly crumbling in every tangible manner.  Soon, there might not be much left to do except grabbing a whole lot of guns and heading for the hills.  I hope I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

		<p>Affirmative action is itself the very definition of racism. If observing that affirmative action is evil makes me a racist then I am perfectly content to be a racist. Proud in fact. The word doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all. That wasn&rsquo;t always true, but I am like many citizens of the old Soviet Union who tried their best to live with an evil system but finally woke up to reality. Do you think they were bothered when the Soviets called them &#8220;revisionist backsliders&#8221; or &#8220;reactionary enemies of the people?&#8221; They would certainly be afraid of the oppressive consequences, but the words themselves are, if anything, a badge of honor. If a deeply stupid, affirmative-action parasite and left-wing fascist like Obama calls me a racist he is actually bestowing a very high compliment. </p>
<p>People like Obama are literally the enemies of this country and they want to destroy it and the decent White people who still make it work to the extent that it still does. People like Bush were no better than the Obamas and are a perfect example of the kind of White cowards that seem to hold sway in the West. The story of the United States as a success is the story of White people. Our failure is the story of White people glorifying nonwhites and accommodating the incompetence and evil ways of non-whites. It is really that simple.</p>
<p>The solution is to deport most nonwhites and reclaim the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa for Whites. There is no other alternative. Even the much-vaunted northern Asians are not really a good fit here. They are from cultures whose default mode is tyranny and mindless conformity. As intelligent as they are supposed to be in Asia, Asia has never been a place where there has been much modern innovation or individual freedom. The rest of the world&rsquo;s nonwhites are half-civilized.</p>
<p>The mass deportation solution may sound impossible, but it&rsquo;s only been about 50-60 years since White surrender began in earnest and I think the situation could be reversed. I have no idea what would have to happen to enable that solution to begin being implemented, but whatever it is, I am reconciled to it and would support it completely. It won&rsquo;t be pleasant, but that&rsquo;s just the way it goes. Living with the current politically-correct, left-wing tyranny is no longer at all tolerable and it&rsquo;s close to being impossible.</p>
<p>In other words, the problem and the solution are both obvious and simple. It only seems complicated because of the system of reality denial and complete fantasy invented by pathological (leftist) minds. 50 years ago I can understand why a lot of White people maybe thought it was a good idea to attempt a racially diverse society, but anyone in touch with reality can see that that has been a complete failure and has led to nothing but another form of Marxist tyranny. Events are forcing large numbers of nice White people to finally face reality and once that happens the struggle will begin in earnest and we will win. It&rsquo;s being forced on us and we have to stop collaborating with the enemy.</p>

This is true; however it`s main value is that it teaches us that we are on our own and that survival is your business not the government or press. Also he misses the point of who posts on Amren. Cement heads like to clog up the ether with back to Africa nonsense and color awareness; however smart blacks post with a take no prisoners style. It is a meeting ground for fanatics who care more about freedom than they do material goods and respectability.<br>
     When the last big storm ripped up our neighborhood, we formed a posse and about 10 of us stood watches for 12 straight nights patrolling against looters and raiders. We drove off a bunch of them. We had one black member and two Puerto Ricans.They almost seemed eager to blast some victim of racist oppression.

On the bottom of the chain is a Celtic cross. I have had several people (white) tell me it was beautiful, but it was racist. I guess being proud of my heritage is racist? If so, then I am one very proud racist. My ancestry is English, Irish, and Scottish, with a couple Austrians thrown in for good measure. Anybody don&rsquo;t like my tattoo, tough. I love it.

		<p>A racist is someone who believes in racial differences, and almost everyone on earth believes in them, regardless of ethnicity.  Some people will just not admit they do, and in the present Western social climiate, one dare not.  Cultural liberals cut off debate by refusing to talk to &#8220;racists&#8221;.  Yet, if we&rsquo;re so stupid and ignorant, we could be easily exposed and rejected.  <br>
Most people of any race know ghettos are dangerous.  It&rsquo;s common knowledge whether the MSM discuss it or not.  And most know that a half century of affirmative action is scarcely helping minorities at all.  But all is not lost.  Things have come to a head, and the mood of the West is turning more conservative.  Look closely at the political scene.  The signs are all over the place.</p>

		<p>All the tiptoeing around the &#8220;racism&#8221; again reminds me that we should forget race and perhaps declare ourselves Europhiles. Argument about race seems endless but there can be no denial about geography and where our Eurowhite genes came from.

Viruses are remarkabley subtle and insinuate into unsuspecting organiisms with craft we can learn from. The manipulation of words are one means.. take for instance {Discrimination}&hellip;The faculty of discrimination is what seperates the wheat from the chaff&hellip; And yet the word has been highjacked and falsely tarnished to manipulate perception. Discrimination has been utilized to mean Persecution. If a white girls instincts tell her she belongs with other whites concerning dating and further, the best she can get among these&hellip; she is using the faculty of discrimination or discression..this is the way of nature. She is not persecuting those she opts to avoid. the same should be seen in other aspects of association in hiring or chosing friendships or selling a house. Freedom&hellip;is what westerners have cherished most, and this passion is what liberated us from gravity in flight or the gravity of the original restraints of primordial nature in subsistance living. There will always be organic tensions to tear down our work in entropic confusion, it is up to us to police every nook and crany of the idealogical structures that support the super structure which is our culture. The viruses I refered to were idealogical in the form of word and perception manipulations..a social structure depends on the integrity of its components, its design, and its maintainence. Amren and Fred are viril contributions to western culture..and thus are always in the cross hairs of the Cains and Hammites of this world.</p>

Which is WHY the various races have emphatically NOT progressed at the same rate over the last 50,000 years or so. That it was the White Race that contributed the Lion&rsquo;s Share to what made modern civilization possible.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The race of criminals is usually suppressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the most shockingly honest statements in the whole article. Blacks are a race of criminals anywhere they exist. </p>
<p>Their Music glorifies it. Their incompatible culture admonishes its members to protect each other and work the system. Their leaders are not Inventors or Captains of Industry, but shake down artists, Rap Thugs, Louis Farrakhan like &#8220;Reverends&#8221; teaching a religion of resistance, oppression and Revenge or harlequin &#8220;Black Historians&#8221; who teach the ignorant black masses that everyone from Shakespeare to Jesus was black and that their true heritage was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from them.</p>
<p>This literally in the midst of the most advanced technological society ever conceived by man, where information is available to anyone at the punch of a few keys, where basic education is free and where the mysteries of the Atom, the Stars and our history are probed in ever finer detail; where the society itself has surpassed all others and extended itself to the moon.</p>

		<p>The 1992 interview of Arthur Jensen by Mr. Taylor contains an<br>
element growing more salient over time  &mdash;  namely, how the matter of an American rebirth is dwarfed in significance by the greater enveloping possibility of a world of human overpopulation that debases life everywhere and even could threaten eventually the<br>
viability of the enclaves on our planet in which learning,civility, lawful conduct, and cultural propagation exists.  My children can manage to migrate to Kiev or Beijing or wherever such enclaves are viable if if America sinks into darkness.   So can yours.  Another element not part of the interview but arising in a later commentary by Jensen is his<br>
functional definition of racism:  &#8220;Nothing scientific can be<br>
racist; nothing racist can be scientific&#8221;   By the Scott Fitzgerald standard of mental excellence, we can hold this notion in mind alongside the very meaningful sense of &#8220;scientific racism&#8221;  But the Jensen defintion is for current circumstances often more useful.  It also might be more popular among whispering Chinese in Beijing than among whispering Whites in, say, Salt Lake City, if in both settings they&rsquo;ve &#8220;read their Rushton&#8221;.  In a world of unprecedented rate of change and synergy, the period from the founding of AR until now is a great historical alteration.  There is nothing remotely ignominious in suggesting basic &#8220;course corrections&#8221; in the AR voyage and defined destination.  Finally it is a dark truism in America that rights formally guaranteed often do not have any practical existence short of massive financial resources to wage problematic uphill struggles that even if successful are so costly as to amount often to net losses.  A big part of the American problem is what Robinson Jeffers captured in his metaphor of the American &#8220;mold of vulgarity&#8221;.  This mold is not very congruent at all with accommodating to the lack of bio-social  equi-potentiality.  The AR assumption has been that if we just turn up the knowledge wattage, the walls will move. Hasn&rsquo;t happened.  Supplant for an issue or two in the AR masthead the Jeffersonian dictum with the Jeffers/ian dictim:<br>
&#8220;Take to the hills, boys&#8221; (passport in backpack ).  </p>

<p>Of all the above posts, I think I agree with #41 the most.</p>
<p>I think that whenever Obama mentions &#8220;we&#8221; in one of his tedious daily  speeches, the &#8220;we&#8221; in his mind is his fellow blacks, no one else, and the black radicals Obama has surrounded himself with should worry everyone. Those people are truly dangerous.<br>

		<p>There is a solution that is only politically impossible due to the media blackout on racial conflict.</p>
<p>We have a second civil war!  All the mainstream media would have to do is start reporting on all the non-White on White crime that they have covered up already and the tide of political opinion would shift toward such scenario.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, there is a reason they don&rsquo;t report such stories.  I believe it has strongly to do with cheap labor and dumbing down of the White population through race mixing.</p>
<p>All the better to create a permenant working class which is smart enough to do the work but too dumb to question why they are working.</p>

		<p>to #52.  Unforunately you are right.  I saw this anti-white trainwreck coming while other whites sheepishily and foolishly bought into the Obama trap.  Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m afraid it will come down to bloodshed, which is not what I wanted.  However, the good is that more and more whites are waking up to the dangers of black rule and black supremacy.</p>

<p>For example no one would care about illegal immigration at all if it were nanotech engineers and radiologists trooping across the border, but sadly it is not.</p>
<p>Any illegal immigration is wrong for alot of reasons. First, it lowers the wages of the people already in those fields. It reduces the incentive for Americans to enter these fields. It also sets a pathway for other illegals. It causes a whole series of lies and exagerations to be propagated to support the flow of illegals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read every single article of his since the first one and once in a blue moon, we&rsquo;ll email each other (because we&rsquo;re both Vietnam Vets). He used to be dead-on in his beliefs. But gradually over the years, he&rsquo;s backed off somewhat from some of his former opinions. This seemed to accelerate when he moved to Mexico.</p>
<p>Now and then, he still gets it exactly &#8216;right&rsquo;, and I don&rsquo;t intend to stop reading his stuff, but sometimes it just bothers me that he&rsquo;s not the Fred Reed of &#8216;old&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I noticed that too. I saw one of his columns where he blamed Americans for illegal immigration. He used the old saw that we are hiring them. He never touched on the part about the government ignoring the wishes of the majority of the people and turning a blind eye to benefit business leaders who want cheap labor.</p>

		<p>To Lizard Among You (aka, Bon,) regarding: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think that we indeed DO need a superhero, John-Bon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly Bon, I was referencing a Sci-Fi series of books by the author Harry Turtledove, called &#8220;The World War&#8221; series. An interesting saga to say the least, in which a race of lizards invade the earth in 1942; the entire saga, 8 books in all, span the years of 1942 to 2034. I will not give away details since, if you decided to read them (which I strongly suggest to anyone here at AR who likes Sci-Fi) it would ruin the suspense and surprises in them.</p>
<p>It suffices to say that even though Turtledove is the typical Marxist PhD type, he surprisingly, if also unwittingly, makes the northern/southern hemisphere split between the races quite evident.</p>
<p>All the best to you Bon,</p>
<p>John!</p>

		<p>63 John PM: I read one of Turtledove&rsquo;s books, the first one I think, about how South African racists came from the future to help the Confederacy.  By arming the Southerners with AK47s, they would ensure Union defeat.  But R. E. Lee was offended by their &#8220;racism&#8221;.  <br>
     I would sooner believe that South Africans have mastered time travel than believe that R.E. Lee would decline their assistance because they weren&rsquo;t liberals.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;I would sooner believe that South Africans have mastered time travel than believe that R.E. Lee would decline their assistance because they weren&rsquo;t liberals.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I agree with you 100% here and that is why I have never read, &ldquo;The Guns of the South.&rdquo; In fact, I was very adverse to reading anything Comrade Turtledove had written, until he came out with the &ldquo;World War&rdquo; series. When it came out, I was given the first book as a gift and so enjoyed its highly imaginative and fully plausible portrayal of an alien invasion during World War II, that I was hooked.  Indeed, his filthy Multi Cult politics are still evident, but the books are also so highly enjoyable, that one can read between them and still be entertained; in particular, the invading space lizards perceptions of humanity are extremely hilarious. </p>
<p>One need not purchase these books and enrich him any further than he deserves, as they should all be available at any decent library. </p>
<p>All the best to you Anonymous 64,</p>
