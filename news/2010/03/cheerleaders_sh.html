<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/27/cheerleaders-india-cricket-women">Cheerleaders Shame Indian Cricket</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), March 27, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I certainly do not count myself in the ranks of cricket&rsquo;s innumerable &#8220;purists&#8221; for whom the plodding rhythms and rituals of the sport carry a kind of holy truth. But there is at least one aspect of the glitzy and compelling Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament that will not win even my grudging acceptance: cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Now in its third year, the IPL has made cheerleaders an integral part of its &#8220;brand&#8221;, its heady cocktail of world-class sporting talent, rippling corporate muscle, and unabashed Bollywood glamour. Whenever a wicket falls or a batsman clobbers a boundary, dancers leap upon stages at the edges of the field to gyrate for the cameras and the crowds. This sort of impromptu, threadbare jigging was new to both cricket and the landscape of Indian sport, and its introduction has generated no small amount of interest and enthusiasm (as any casual Google, Twitter or Flickr search will reveal). IPL grandees are well aware of the popularity of its mostly foreign, mostly white cheerleaders, organising reality TV shows and fan contests to further cash in on their appeal.</p>
<p>From the inception of the IPL, much of the opposition to cheerleading has come from conservative religious groups, who staged heated demonstrations in 2008 when the dancers first took to the IPL stage. Even this year, a rightwing group in the coastal state of Orissa demanded that matches staged there should eschew cheerleaders altogether. While this species of angry conservative austerity may be getting noisier in India, its prudishness is familiar to us all. Social conservatism the world over shares a strange mix of sanctimony and prurience, the mingled terror of and obsession with the flesh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not offended by cheerleading, more bored by it. In any grown-up context, it offers a dispiriting definition of both leadership and cheer. Many cricket fans, including myself, would be happy to see the (metaphorical) back of these cheerleaders. Their twists and pumps add nothing to what is, in truth, a wonderful sporting spectacle. They are a reminder of the ocean of inanities that commercial modernity promises our lives, drowning all occasions in froth. First the fall from grace, then the flood.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t just grit my teeth or laugh it off. Regular viewers of the IPL are now familiar with the sight of leering spectators separated from the cheerleaders in some stadiums by cage-like fences, an image that brings the cricket arena uncomfortably close to a zoo. It is the larger dichotomy suggested by this unfortunate image that I find troubling, that of Indian men ogling mostly white, non-Indian women. All too common in India is the belief in the licentiousness of foreign women. In recent years, stories of sexual violence against tourists in India have proliferated, a tragic byproduct in some cases of the impression that foreign women are naturally promiscuous. While I wouldn&rsquo;t draw a direct line between IPL cheerleaders and such incidences, the very nature of IPL cheerleading as a spectacle feeds deeper, insidious notions about race and sexuality in India.</p>
<p>The paucity of Indian cheerleaders tells its own story. In a country where an entire film industry is sustained by beautiful women dancing, it is hard to believe that the appropriate &#8220;talent&#8221; is missing. The choice made by IPL organisers in this regard suggests, first, the unsettling marketing conclusion that Indians really just want to see white skin. Second, and perhaps more troubling still, it suggests a quiet acquiescence to the view of the conservative elements of society that Indian women are somehow more sacred and less carnal than their western counterparts. Not for them the tight tops and bared thighs of IPL cheerleading. Just like the licentious foreign woman, the idea of the modest Indian woman is closer to fiction than truth. It is the kind of fantasy that animates attacks on girls who had the &#8220;audacity&#8221; to have a drink at a pub (as happened in Mangalore last year). It is an ideal that masks the sexual violence perpetrated against Indian women on a daily basis (an issue about which I have written in these web pages before).</p>
<p>This is not a problem that can simply be &#8220;solved&#8221; through levelling the balance of Indian and non-Indian cheerleaders, through equal opportunity objectification. By enshrining cheerleaders in its commercial product, the IPL has opened a can of worms and made stilted perceptions of sex part of its image. This image is a global one now; IPL matches are screened live on YouTube and on ITV in the UK. If the IPL is indeed one way through which aspirational India projects itself on the global stage, Indians should consider the messages it sends. We should recognise the unsavoury manner in which we can represent others, and ourselves, to the world.<br>

		<p>Cricket is baseball played at the speed of golf.  They need cheerleaders.  India is not short of teen beauties who can dance a bit.  Bollywood has been mass producing them for decades.  While the author, like most middle class Indians, pretends to be bored by cheerleading, he, like most middle class Indians, devour Bollywood movies.  They love it.  And most Bollywood heroines have been light skinned.  Nothing new here.</p>

		<p>The only affordable (to Indians) source for blond women is the remnants of the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>The only respectable cheerleading is found in colleges, where they use real students of both sexes.   In pro sports it&rsquo;s really skeezy.  (We Jints fans always got a laugh at how ready our Dallas rivals are to sully their well-burnished corporate image with hired dancers.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with the Indian prudes on this one.  So is great-grandma.</p>

		<p>As despicable as rapists are, even they sometimes feel guilty and try to soothe their consciences by telling themselves that their victim(s) wanted it.</p>
<p>Many Muslims try to claim that white women are promiscuous whores who are inviting sexual assault. As the author notes, many Hindu men have the same mindset.</p>

		<p>Most brown and black males are crazy for White women. They may deny this fact but this is true. White women are on average far more attractive than their own women and have (unfortunately) a reputation for being loose throughout the Third world. It is also a way to get back at the all powerful God like White Man. 50 years of the leftist sexual revolution has destroyed Western social norms and turned its women into &#8216;whores&rsquo; in the eyes of these men. <br>
I have seen some of these IPL matches and I find those ugly Indian men leering at those White women dancing for their pleasure disgusting. It will only further the bad reputation White women have in the world.<br>

		<p>Well, no one in the world can be believed for an instant if they claim (pretend) that white women, especially blonde ones are the most beautiful on the planet. Indians can&rsquo;r be blamed if they&rsquo;re quite honely if not ugly in comparison.</p>

<p>The dancers in Bollywood films are foreign.  They would  want blondes in those movies if they could afford it.  Since they can&rsquo;t afford European girls they actually bring in light skinned girls from Iran.  </p>

<p>Because of my father&rsquo;s job, I spent a great deal of time growing up in a Middle Eastern country.  I remember how stunned I was when men of the region who were in their thirties would harrass me when I was only 12 or 13.  I personally thought plenty of their own young women were beautiful.  I remember how shocking it was finding out that they would make such a big deal over my appearance just because I was blonde and blue eyed.  And yes, it really doesn&rsquo;t help that they see Western women as &#8220;easy&#8221;.  I didn&rsquo;t give them the time of day even when I got to be older, so hopefully my behavior influenced their opinions a little.  I am sure many other white women have acted just the same as I when they have spent time over there (giving them the cold shoulder).</p>
<p>And here I am obviously being sarcastic, and I am in NO way encouraging this behavoir, but if you are a blonde woman and you don&rsquo;t feel attractive in this country, I &#8220;encourage&#8221; you to go spend a vacation in the Middle East. Every man on the street will drop what they are doing and stare at you even if you are wearing modest clothing. </p>

		<p>I am blond and blue-eyed (female), and I lived in India for a number of years as a child. I was constantly stared at. My father has some funny home movies showing groups of Indians walking past me; the moment I pass by them, all heads simultaneously whip around to stare at me!<br>
 <br>
&#8220;And overall, India does indeed have huge numbers of stunningly beautiful caucasian women.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even remotely true: in 5 years of living there, I didn&rsquo;t see a single one. There aren&rsquo;t any white people native to India. The upper classes, and the Brahmins, are not white. They are brown: just not as dark as the lower classes.</p>
<p> There aren&rsquo;t hordes of beautiful Causasian women in India, unless you&rsquo;re talking about the tourists or guru-groopies in the ashrams.  And it&rsquo;s not a good place to look for a wife unless you want to contribute to the racial degradation of America. The Anglo-Indians (mixed British and Indian) look mixed.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll second &#8220;Anonymous&#8220;&#8216;s comment that &#8220;Oriental&#8221; (northeast Asian) women are believed most beautiful within their race.</p>
<p>Which is good. Each to his own. The brown masses are ugly, but whites and northeast Asians can at least preserve their own peoples, declining to outmix entirely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need for one race to be superior, and that drive to dominate seems to have driven whites nearly into extinction within a century. We need simply to defend our borders and live among our own people, as whites. Those who marry out should be cast out.</p>
