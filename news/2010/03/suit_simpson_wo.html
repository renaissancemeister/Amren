<h1>Suit Simpson Wore to &#8216;95 Acquittal Will Be Offered to Smithsonian</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, March 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The brownish-green suit that O.J. Simpson wore the day he was acquitted of murder in what has often been described as the &#8220;trial of the century&#8221; will be donated to the Smithsonian Institution  &mdash;  if the museum wants it.</p>
<p>A judge has approved the transfer Monday, said Fred Goldman, the father of the man the ex-National Football League star was accused of killing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The highly publicized trial lasted more than nine months and ended on October 3, 1995, with a jury finding Simpson not guilty.</p>
<p>Later, Brown and Goldman families took Simpson to civil court to seek damages for wrongful death. That jury found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded $8.5 million in compensatory damages to the Goldman family and to Ron Goldman&rsquo;s biological mother.</p>
<p>Since then, Fred Goldman has been trying to collect the money. Simpson has consistently said he did not kill the two and should not have to pay.</p>
<p>In 2008, Gilbert, the sports agent, appeared on the &#8220;Dr. Phil&#8221; television show, claiming he had the suit and pants Simpson wore on the day of the acquittal. He also said the &#8220;acquittal suit&#8221;  &mdash;  as it came to be known  &mdash;  was worth $50,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Superior Court judge ordered the suit donated to the Smithsonian. If the museum passes on it, it will be offered to another museum.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Nancy Dillon, New York Daily News, March 2, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Smithsonian is taking a pass on O.J.</p>
<p>The venerable museum has no intention of accepting the so-called &#8220;lucky suit&#8221; that O.J. Simpson wore the day a jury found him not guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a quick meeting with our curatorial team this morning and decided this wouldn&rsquo;t be anything we&rsquo;d collect. It&rsquo;s just not appropriate for our collection,&#8221; Smithsonian National Museum of American History spokeswoman Valeska Hilbig told the Daily News.</p>
<p>The khaki suit was one of the items O.J. Simpson, 62, hoped to recover when he led a group of thugs on an armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2007.</p>
<p>He never got the suit, and he&rsquo;s now serving a minimum nine-year prison sentence in Nevada for the botched heist.</p>
<p>The disgraced NFL star told the judge and lawyers by phone Monday that he didn&rsquo;t object to donating the suit &#8220;as long as no one made a profit from it,&#8221; his attorney Ronald P. Slates said.</p>

		<p>What is the Smithsonian thinking, passing up on such a grand opportunity as this??? They could place the &#8220;lucky suit&#8221; right next to Henry Louis Gates&rsquo; lucky handcuffs!!! Just a few more months and a brand new &#8220;lucky&#8221; museum wing could be born! May I suggest  &#8220;Artifacts of Lucky African-Americans Arrested For Crimes They Committed&#8221; as the title.</p>

		<p>That suit is historically significant.  That acquittal was the birth of real black power in the US.  Two whites were brutally murdered.  The killer was caught, the evidence against him iron clad.  The black jury said it is OK to kill whitey.  End of story.</p>
<p>I was at work when the verdict was announced.  The blacks cheered and hollered in glee.  It was scary to say the least.  It is our future.<br>

<p>Better save it.  He&rsquo;ll need it to wear to his next conviction after he gets out of the Lovelock prison system.  He&rsquo;s black, remember?  When has a black ever deviated from crime, once he gets started?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the author of a book I read years ago titled &#8220;Farnham&rsquo;s Freehold&#8221; but if anyone else ever read it, it is coming true. A premise of the story is blacks coming out on top and using whites as slave labor, cattle and FOOD!</p>

		<p>There was nothing &#8220;lucky&#8221; about that suit. He was aquitted because the black jury liked the color of his skin, not his clothes.</p>
<p>OJ could have worn a clown suit, a Halloween costume or an SS uniform and the jury nullification would have been the same.</p>

		<p>Has anyone else (white anyone else) been to the Smithsonian and found EVERYTHING closed for some reason or other but the (at the time I was there) new MLK museum which is a huge new building with only photos on the wall and some junk called Afro art!!! Well,. the suit would fit very well there I think. I think the Smithsonian should be moved to a safer town.</p>

		<p>I was watching a national morning news show a while back. A woman in her late sixties or early seventies was being interviewed. It was in front of her trailer park home, albeit a nice and well manicured one.<br>
  She was almost complaining how The Smithsonian wouldn`t leave her alone, begging that she donate her prom dress to them. And she refused them at least until after her grand-daughter wore it to her prom. And I wondered, why would the museum want a 50 year old dress from a lower middle class lady who lived in a trailer?!? <br>
  The answer? Her prom date was a 16 year old boy with duck tail and pimples who had  the unusual  first name of Elvis&hellip;<br>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t he just auction it off on ebay? He probably could use the money or at least his children could. There has to be some imbecile out there who would treasure such a famous garment.</p>

		<p>Back in &#8216;94 I too was at work when the decision was announced, but I made sure to go to lunch a little bit late that day.  Since the company I was working for had a whole group of rowdy Blacks and White liberals I didn&rsquo;t want to be around for the cheering and the slap-me-fives, if they announced a not-guilty verdict.  It was so pathetic - both the decision - and the reactions.  I fear we have not yet seen the worst.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the Smithsonian in over 20 years, however, it&rsquo;s good to see that in a world where Barack Obama can get the Nobel Peace Prize when he&rsquo;s done nothing for world peace, the Smithsonian doesn&rsquo;t lower itself to the point of putting OJ Simpson&rsquo;s suit on display. </p>
