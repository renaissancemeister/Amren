			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>San Francisco Chronicle, March 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Los Angeles police officer who received the state&rsquo;s highest public safety award for helping rescue a man from a burning car has been awarded $125,000 in a discrimination and retaliation lawsuit.</p>
<p>The jury returned the verdict Friday, awarding Officer Paul Waymire damages for pain and suffering but no money for lost income.</p>
<p>Waymire sued the police department, claiming he was treated differently by a Latino supervisor because he was white. He says he filed a discrimination complaint with the state and was denied promotions in retaliation, even though he was more qualified than other applicants.</p>

		<p>I was always a law and order guy, until a couple Mexican LAPDs harassed me for entering an air show at Van Nuys Airport with a pocketknife, like I was going to highjack a P-51, and then said &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like it, go to another country.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re not our cops anymore.  </p>

		<p>$125,000 is parking change and barely enough to cover one night&rsquo;s worth of debauchery for LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take more than $125,000 to get the attention of LA politicos.</p>

		<p>Thank the heavens&hellip;finally we are starting to see more and more courts realize that Whites can be discriminated against, as well.  It&rsquo;s a trickle, but will become a tide as more Americans start to realize how the progressives have sold the farm to the &#8220;forced diversity&#8221; interests.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;A Los Angeles police officer has been awarded $125,000 in a discrimination and retaliation lawsuit.</p>
<p>The jury returned the verdict Friday, awarding Officer Paul Waymire damages for pain and suffering but no money for lost income&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>This blurb (not article) was on the next to the last page of my local paper near the bottom (and I live outside of LA).  No details were provided, and I&rsquo;m sure there will be no further mention of this anti-White discrimination case.</p>
<p>Yet when the idiotic tenny pierce ate two bites of dog food and cried &#8216;racism!&rsquo; there was article after article decrying &#8216;institutionalized White racism&rsquo; in the LAFD and LAPD.  Blacks screamed that dog food reminded them of slavery.  The case should have been laughed out of court and pierce and his lawyers severely reprimanded for wasting valuable court time and demanding that taxpayers of an already over-taxed city fork over a huge amount of money for something so trivial and stupid.</p>
<p>The city council agree to settle for $2.7 million.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was SO much outcry, mostly expressed via John &amp; Ken&rsquo;s talk radio show  &mdash;  firefighter after firefighter called in anonymously and reported that pierce was lazy, late to work, was moved around from station to station and continually looked for ways to get out of duty.  Pictures were faxed to John &amp; Ken by disgruntled White firefighters showing pierce taking part in pranks and hazing himself.</p>
<p>Finally, after tremendous public pressure:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa today vetoed the controversial $2.7 million settlement with a Los Angeles firefighter tricked into eating dog food, after reviewing photos that showed the firefighter had engaged in hazing and pranks himself&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The outcome?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;He and the city have settled for $1.43 million. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa calls it the &#8216;best possible&rsquo; outcome&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And, he only ate two bites of dogfood, putting his take at $715,000 per bite.</p>
<p>Looks like his wish came true and he and his lawyers hit the &#8216;offended black&rsquo;  lottery.</p>

		<p>All good and well. BUT!! Why does it always seem that when a  White wins one of these suits he is awarded peanuts, and when a minority wins one it is in the multiple millions?</p>

		<p>I can just hear non-white racists and white liberals justifying this anti-white racism by saying, &#8220;Well, white people did the same thing&hellip;.&#8221;  They can&rsquo;t help but make excuses for what they claimed happened in the past.  I guess it&rsquo;s easier for liberals to focus on the &#8216;evil past&rsquo; then deal with the here and now.</p>

		<p>I had a couple of Latino boys in blue driving a paddy wagon pull me over about 3 years ago for doing absolutely nothing while walking through my local downtown area. They said that a white guy stole some womans car.  They repeated to me several times not once that if I looked out my window and saw a hispanic stealing my car that I would want that hispanic found. They made it very clear in a subtle way why they were pulling me over. They were doing a little white racial profiling. Should I support more police &#8220;diversity&#8221;?</p>

		<p>There was definitely a loss of income, since the officer would have received more salary if he were promoted.  I don&rsquo;t see how a jury can say the incident involved discrimination, yet didn&rsquo;t logically follow that being denied the higher paying position cost him money.</p>
<p>Because of the low settlement, which is no more than chump change, and because LA County is mostly non-white, the mostly non-white jury felt whites don&rsquo;t deserve more money, but because the discrimination was so egregious they were forced to offer something.</p>
<p>Whites get no justice in this society anymore.  We must make our own justice and prepare and work towards that end.  Anybody who does not should be rejected as the fool he is.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad a white man at least got some pocket change for his efforts - but trust me, those of us who have lived in the L.A. area for any length of time know that we need to get out of here ASAP.  Mexicans, blacks, and Muslims are looking to take over; with their birth rate they probably will, and I sure don&rsquo;t want to be here when that happens.  I&rsquo;m headin&rsquo; for the hills - literally.</p>
