			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kenneth Lovett, New York Daily News, March 3, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If things weren&rsquo;t bad enough for Gov. Paterson, he was hit with an ethics violation Wednesday for accepting free Yankees World Series tickets.</p>
<p>The state Public Integrity Commission [PIC] accused Paterson of violating the state gifts ban and misusing his official position to secure free World Series tickets  &mdash;  five of them.</p>
<p>Paterson is charged with violating two provisions of the state gift ban, which carries a maximum penalty of $80,000.</p>
<p>He is also accused of violating three sections of state ethics law, each of which carries a $10,000 maximum fine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The PIC found &#8220;there is reasonable cause&#8221; to believe that Paterson falsely testified under oath that he always intended to pay for the World Series tickets for his son and son&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>The PIC claims that Paterson had written a check for $850 to repay the Yankees, &#8220;when, in fact, the governor&rsquo;s intention was to receive and accept the tickets for himself, his son, and his son&rsquo;s friend without paying for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only after a press inquiry that the governor submitted the backdated check as payment for the tickets.</p>
<p>And the check, though filled out and signed with the governor&rsquo;s name, was not in Paterson&rsquo;s handwriting, but likely Johnson&rsquo;s, the commission found.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Paterson&rsquo;s politics, but I get the sense that the media have a vendetta out on him, for some reason.  I mean, what has he done that was so bad that every other politician doesn&rsquo;t do?  He won&rsquo;t run for a term as Governor in his own right, so Andrew Cuomo has nothing to worry about in his own party.  My only theory is that the media and New York&rsquo;s official left-wing want Paterson gone ASAP, because they think that he&rsquo;d be a drag on NY Democrats in general, even if he is a lame duck.</p>
<p>Personally, and in spite of his race, Paterson isn&rsquo;t really worse than other New York State governors, including most of the Republicans.  George Pataki is a big time race panderer.  He&rsquo;s for amnesty, and he&rsquo;s also a gun grabber.  David Paterson at least has a personality indicative of a person not on Proozac.</p>

		<p>To Q.D. (#1):</p>
<p>For someone who lives in St Louis you have a better grasp of the Empire State political scene than most of my fellow NYers. I also feel the liberal media want Paterson out because they know Cuomo the gun-grabber has a far better chance of defeating a GOP challenger.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true Paterson is a leftist who often plays the race card, at the same time he&rsquo;s the first NY gov in decades to try to rein in out-of-control spending and taxing, something Pataki never attempted during his 12 years of RINO rule.</p>
<p> As an aside, a close friend of mine is a state trooper who provides a security detail for NY pols. He told me Paterson was a genial, self-effacing joker while his predecessor Eliot Spitzer was an arrogant, despicably vile egomaniac.  </p>

		<p>What makes anyone think that Paterson or anyone in New York government cares?</p>
<p>Paterson being on his way out has nothing to do with this, in ultra-corrupt New York.  Paterson could get caught smoking crack and screwing whores he paid for with taxpayer money and he wouldn&rsquo;t be called to account for it.  Oh wait a minute, he WAS caught smoking crack and screwing whores he paid for with taxpayer money.  And despite a minor initial outcry, nothing was done about it.</p>
<p>Paterson is leaving because the money has run out.  New York is going to be forced to reduce &#8220;entitlement spending&#8221; (ie welfare for blacks).  Our masters Bernanke and the fed have dictated that it be so&hellip;..so it will be done.</p>
<p>Paterson (and Rangel, and eventually Obama himself) are getting out so they won&rsquo;t be blamed by other blacks for it.</p>
<p>Blacks are a protected class in the western world, especially the US.  They have special privledges other people don&rsquo;t.  One of those privledges is immunity from ethics violations.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what Paterson did.  It doesn&rsquo;t MATTER that he was caught.</p>

		<p>Poster#1 made an interesting comment. <br>
Maybe Paterson just lacks the &#8220;polished&#8221; image and looks so obviously bad that he&rsquo;s making their agenda so transparently unsound they decided to not support him.   </p>

		<p>Seems like small potatos compared to many.  Although it&rsquo;s popular to say otherwise, I think the process against Blagojevich was also a witch hunt. Most of the accusations prior to the Obongo incident were about improper loans of a few hundred dollars and other nonsense.  Meanwhile, look at what Congress gets away with.  </p>
