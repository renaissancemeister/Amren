<h1>Culture Clash: European Art Provokes Muslims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Weissenstein, Yahoo News, March 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the West locked in conflicts across the Muslim world, why would anyone throw fuel on the fire?</p>
<p>A small group of Europeans have been doing just that  &mdash;  provoking death plots and at least one murder by turning out art that derides the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran in the name of Western values.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes is something bigger: a rising European unease with a rapidly growing Muslim minority, and the spreading sense that the continent has become a front in a clash of civilizations.</p>
<p>Recent events  &mdash;  including surprising electoral success by an anti-Islamic Dutch party, moves to ban veils in France and minarets in Switzerland, and arrests in Ireland and the U.S. this week in an alleged plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist  &mdash;  are signs of the rising tensions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The cases are extreme, but millions of moderate Europeans also are re-examining the meaning of the liberal values widely cherished across the continent. How, many are asking, should a liberal society respectfully deal with immigrants who often espouse illiberal values? Should the immigrants adopt the values of their adoptive land  &mdash;  or, to the contrary, should society change to accommodate the newcomers who now form part of it?</p>
<p>France, home to at least five million of the estimated 14 million Muslims in Western Europe, launched a parliament-run dialogue on what to do about full-face veils last year. It ended with a parliamentary panel recommending a ban on the veils in buses, trains, hospitals, post offices and public sector facilities. In December, a large majority of Swiss voters backed a ballot initiative banning the building of any new minarets.</p>
<p>The measures sparked some peaceful protests. But the most incendiary provocations have come from the Dutch and their Nordic neighbors, nations with long histories of homogeneity, tradition of provocative artwork and less experience with large-scale immigration than former colonial titans like Britain and France.</p>
<p>Jan Hjarpe, a professor emeritus of Islamic studies at Lund University in southern Sweden, near Vilks&rsquo; home, said the deliberate provocations were helpful to Islamic extremists, who have been hunting for targets that would win them popularity in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has had almost no effect on the Muslim community in Sweden, who regard it as not very interesting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These threats against him have to do with extremist groups that want something to react to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s Prophet Muhammad cartoons emerged from a discussion in 2005 about whether Islam was being treated with special sensitivity among Danish artists for fear of reprisals from extremists. Jyllands-Posten said the project was a way to challenge self-censorship and show that Muslims, too, must be ready to put up with mockery in a society based on democracy and free speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> It was only in 2002 when the populist politician Pim Fortuyn began speaking openly against immigration and the threat to the Dutch identity that people felt free to voice their anger. Fortuyn&rsquo;s popularity soared, and the party he founded was hugely popular even after Fortuyn himself was assassinated (by an animal rights activist). </p>
<p>Successive governments clamped down on immigration and forced new arrivals to learn about the Dutch language and culture in an attempt to integrate them into mainstream society. </p>
<p>Wilders is derided by his enemies as a neo-fascist but has been able to turn his provocations into political success: his Freedom Party winning in the town of Almere and coming in second in The Hague this month the only two races it ran out of 394 cities and towns that elected local councils. </p>
<p>If the outcome is any indication of the parliamentary vote in June, Wilders could emerge as a king-maker on the national stage with no combination of parties is likely to be able to form a working majority in the next parliament. </p>

		<p>How can anyone not see what the future of Europe is going to be?  These Muslims are going to literally push the Europeans out of their indigenous countries if they don&rsquo;t put up a fight.  Right now very few are standing up with few exceptions like the BNP.  All of Europe needs a BNP.  They need one in every country before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to &#8220;offend&#8221; Muslims.  I wonder how any of them ever get into, much less complete, medical school?  No wonder their health care is at 3rd world status!  And how in the world do their women ever have babies?  That&rsquo;s pretty raw, after all!  But I am delighted that the Dutch are leading the rest of Europe to rethink the &#8220;value&#8221; of multiculturalism.  The truth is, diversity has brought destruction to our various European cultures, and is threatening to so do in the United States.  The sooner we abandon it the better.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just as offended with the way women are treated in places like Saudi Arabia. It&rsquo;s beyond a disgrace in my opinion. There fore I will avoid going there. If Muslims can&rsquo;t handle the freedoms that Western culture allows then the Muslims can avoid it like I avoid Saudi Arabia. The Muslims have no right what so ever at being offended by our freedoms. This is why they should stay in their culture in the first place and not attempt to change ours. The end result will only be them getting stepped on when their intolerance eventually becomes too much of a problem.</p>

		<p>It reads here that Pim Fortuyn was murdered by an &#8220;animal rights activist.&#8221;  However, I think there is ample evidence that the &#8220;activist&#8221;/murderer in question, Volkert van der Graaf, had/has very strong links to the radical Muslim community in The Netherlands, but not necessarily international terrorist cabals like AQ. </p>
<p>I only wish the Dutch authorities would have monitored the bank accounts of Graaf&rsquo;s closest friends, closest political allies, close family, allied political groups in the animal rights scene, etc.  If any of their bank accounts had shown strange balance increases, then they could have traced it to the account(s) that so decreased, and found radical Muslims at the other end.</p>

<p>His unsupported defence is no surprise. My personal experience with professors who specialize in studying a foreign people is that, like the Stockholm Syndrome, they come to over-sympathize with their subjects.  </p>
<p>Rather than reservedly studying them as exiles from their homeland, they begin to legitimize the diaspora living abroad as a half-Westernized representation of the real deal. Their sympathizing turns to active enabling, as they get unprofessionally attached to their subjects.   </p>

		<p>It should be understood that to a Muslim, ANY depiction of the human form is forbidden. Even children in art class in school drawing a STICK FIGURE is considered to be evil! And as for the many representations in &#8220;western&#8221; art of nudes and such, well, forget it. And sculpture as done in ancient Greece of the muscular naked athlete, forget it. And the David as done by Michael-what-is-his-name? Well, forget it too.</p>

<p>    I agree.  As far as I know, Pim Fortuyn&rsquo;s party had no platform on animal rights. Mr. Fortuyn was murdered for his immigration policies pure and simple  &mdash;  cut the hoax controlled media!<br/>

		<p>With all of the anti Christian artwork that has been foisted on the public all of these years it is sickening to me to see the leftists falling all over themselves to keep from &#8220;offending&#8221; Muslim invaders. The same leftists who tell Christians who are offended by a crucifix in urine or a portrait of the virgin Mary covered by elephant dung to &#8220;understand art&#8221; go ballistic over Muhammed cartoons or other so called anti-Islamic art. These sensitive morons need to either understand that they are here in America or Europe and that we are not going to adapt our culture to yours. Some of these idiot Muslims are offended by pantyhose packaging and underwear displays. </p>

<p>Thank you, Sardonicus and QD. You caught them in that lie.  As I recall, though speaking from memory, the fact did come out AFTERWARDS, though revealed only in a  muted and reluctant way, that he sympathized with the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; as an oppressed group and had wanted to show his sympathy for them&hellip;. Something like that. Yes, it came out that the murder of Fortuyn was much more than &#8220;animal rights&#8221; activism.  The controlled media hated to admit this and were determined to cover it up.  The above writer is participating in the cover-up.</p>
<p>And, btw, come to think of it,  is there not something intrinsically very bizarre about an &#8220;animal rights activist&#8221; identifying with militant Moslems who make a practice of ritually (and brutally) slaughtering animals on their holidays as part of their &#8220;culture&#8221;?  They make vey strange bedfellows indeed.  Hard to believe.<br/>

		<p>This is what Muslims are like now as a small part of the population. What are they going to be like three or four decades from now when they are close to the majority in several European countries? That&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  they are going to demand total control over their host societies. Europeans better start finding some nerve sometime very soon or they and their societies, values, culture, and heritage are doomed.</p>
<p>I hope Geert Wilders continues to grow in popularity. He&rsquo;s one of the few European politicians who calls the immigrants what they really are: &#8220;colonizers.&#8221; He also is not afraid to state repeatedly and without reservation that Western Civilization is far superior to Islamic society. Why can&rsquo;t we have someone this blunt and gutsy in the US? He may not care very much about racial issues, but the biggest threat right now to Dutch society is Islamic, and he is putting his life on the line to stop that threat.</p>
<p>#5 &amp; 12   &mdash;   Fortuyn&rsquo;s murderer even told the judge during his trial that Fortuyn&rsquo;s stance on immigration was one of the reasons he murdered him. People need to know this.</p>
