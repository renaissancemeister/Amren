<h1><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2010/03/29/daily11.html">Denver Lawyer Shepherd Sanctioned on Diversity Claim</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Renee McGawm, Denver Business Journal, March 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Well-known Denver lawyer Willie Shepherd has been publicly censured for overstating his former law firm&rsquo;s diversity in order to attract a client.</p>
<p>Presiding Disciplinary Judge William Lucero fined Shepherd $127.50 and ordered a public censure for Shepherd&rsquo;s misconduct in 2007, while he was a partner at what was then known as Kamlet Shepherd &amp; Reichert LLP. Lucero&rsquo;s order was entered on Friday in the Colorado Supreme Court, which regulates state-licensed attorneys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shepherd hoped to get KSR qualified for the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Diverse Legal Supplier Program, according to a stipulation agreement filed on March 18 as part of the disciplinary proceeding. Only law firms with at least 50 percent equity ownership by women or minorities are eligible for the program.</p>
<p>In December 2007, Shepherd sent an email to two people in the DuPont legal department stating that 48.5 percent of KSR&rsquo;s equity partners were women and/or minorities; in fact, the level was 30.1 percent, according to the court document.</p>
<p>In January 2008, Shepherd wrote again to DuPont, claiming that KSR met the program criteria even though he knew that it did not, according to the court document.</p>

		<p>I wish all law firms would advertise how &#8220;diverse&#8221; they were so I could avoid ones that were.</p>
<p>There are two things I&rsquo;m going to try to avoid in the coming years:  Black doctors and black lawyers.  I don&rsquo;t trust anybody who can&rsquo;t read his certification and is an AA awardee.</p>

		<p>To #2: Man have you got that right!</p>
<p>I would never ever ever ever trust my life to those of the more nobly ruddy complexion. Your doctor?! Your lawyer?! No way. <br>
Would you trust a product of Affirmative Action with your internal organs? Or your estate?</p>
<p>Give me an Ashkenazi Jew or a European-American in either situation!</p>

		<p>To posters #2 and 4, I also don&rsquo;t want to put my life in the hands of A/A doctors, or lawyers for that matter.  I did have a good black doctir once, but he was smart only because he had a horrible blotchy skin condition that probably got him excluded from black culture.  All he had left were his studies.  I&rsquo;ve met A/A school personnel at all levels and I have not found a smart and/or capable one among the bunch.</p>

		<p>If our new health care program is like the Tennessee TNCare program you will not know who your doctor is until you arrive. I was assigned a doctor from India who could only comunicate in broken english which I could not understand and then I was assigned a black doctor and I would not let him touch me.</p>
<p>After the two above incidents I was informed by Tencare that I would be terminated if I refused to see the next doctor they assigned to me, I enrolled with the VA which was just as bad.<br>
