<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/24/immigration-plan-would-create-mother-of-all-backlo/">DHS IG: Immigration Plan Will Bury Agency</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, March 24, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The federal government is not equipped to process the flood of applications from a proposed immigration legalization bill and the agency that would oversee that program won&rsquo;t be ready for &#8220;a few years,&#8221; the office of the Homeland Security Department&rsquo;s inspector general told Congress on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The warning, from Assistant Inspector General Frank Deffer, could severely complicate President Obama&rsquo;s new push to pass an immigration bill this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Adding 12 million more people to the system would be the mother of all backlogs. Clearly to us the systems could not handle it now,&#8221; Mr. Deffer told the House Judiciary Committee&rsquo;s immigration subcommittee. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to take a few years, so it&rsquo;s something for Congress to consider that, when they implement this, they don&rsquo;t have a date too soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Obama, in a video message last weekend, told tens of thousands of immigrant rights supporters rallying on the Mall that he wants to try to get a bipartisan immigration bill passed this year that would legalize the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.</p>
<p>USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said flatly that his agency will be prepared to handle that task but that he anticipates Congress will give the agency more resources to handle a new program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s ability to handle an influx of applications is critical, particularly after studies showed the last amnesty, in 1986, gave legal status to hundreds of thousands of criminals and others who should not have been allowed to stay under the conditions of the law.</p>
<p>Fraudulent documents are already a problem for other programs administered by USCIS, such as E-Verify, the voluntary system businesses can use to see if job applicants are authorized to work. A recent study prepared for the agency found that E-Verify was able to weed out only about half of the illegal immigrants who applied for jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Deffer said one of the reasons the inspector general began looking at USCIS&rsquo; technology five years ago was because of the efforts then to push for a new legalization bill.</p>
<p>He said occasional backlogs of applications are part of a cycle.</p>
<p>USCIS has been trying to upgrade its immigration benefits process for years, and Mr. Mayorkas acknowledged there have been few visible results. But he said the effort is moving, and officials are being careful because of many potential pitfalls.</p>

		<p>That said, why are we to think that any preconditions to gaining citizenship under a proposed &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; will be monitored?  If a given illegal alien has to pay &#8220;back taxes&#8221; (meaning he or she was dodging taxes while working illegally), or pay a &#8220;fine,&#8221; why are we to think he or she will actually do those things?  </p>

		<p>The worst thing that amnesty will do, if it is enacted, will be to cause another tsunami of illegals into our country because they will try to wait for the next one to come  .Amnesty, by definition is something that should happen only ONCE.</p>

		<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t imagine how amnesty can pass given the state of the economy.  But then again I didn&rsquo;t think the government takeover of health care could pass.</p>
<p>Barack Hussein Obama is making history, but not in the way he believes.  The US was facing an extremely bleak future before the presidential election of 2008.  Obama has virtually assured us that we&rsquo;ll be carting around wheelbarrows full of dollars to buy a loaf of bread in the not-too-distant future.      </p>

		<p>&#8220;Amnesty would create &ldquo;the mother of all backlogs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the worst of it, however.  Granting amnesty now will mean more people in this health care debacle at a time when medical offices are short on doctors unable to tend to patients in a timely manner, to say nothing of the additional burden to other social benefits when the economy is offering every indication of going into another severe drop.<br>
 <br>
I don&rsquo;t believe the economy can take all these extra burdens and property defaults occurring at the same time.  I&rsquo;m starting to believe Rush&rsquo;s opinion that this Obama team is involved in a Clowers and Piven strategy of overloading the system until it collapses, so they can make a complete conversion to government control.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to believe, since I&rsquo;m one of many who concludes that a collapse will bring civil war.  Surely, this administration isn&rsquo;t so dumb as to expect they can collapse the system and maintain law and order.  </p>
<p>However, whatever the motivation behind these bizarre decisions by the community organizer&rsquo;s advisers, it&rsquo;s plain that we&rsquo;re unequivocally sliding downhill at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>Too, has anybody but me noticed that the populace is getting increasingly more agitated than at any other time in the last several years?  Have you listened to callers on the talk shows?  Anger is close to reaching the point of action.</p>

		<p>We can overcome health care. It&rsquo;s a bad bill that can be repealed, fought. Immigration however, is truly a catastrophe. We can&rsquo;t survive changing the racial makeup of the country.<br>
I hope all patriotic Americans realize we are now fighting for the survival our country. Obama means to kill it.</p>

		<p>Ok, let me get this straight, the narcissist in the White House just signs a bill that provides health care for all, regardless of pre-existing conditions, ability to pay, etc. etc. He does this by slight of hand, arm-twisting, out and out bribery, and completely disregards the very real objections that a majority of the population voices in opposition to it. He signs the bill by claiming it&rsquo;s still government of the people, by the people while standing on his rhetorical soap box blowing hot air. In the meantime he has this idea of granting amnesty to untold millions of illegals, none of whom pay taxes, and all of whom would be eligible for medical care once legalized. They would then be able to drag in millions more people under family unification acts thereby increasing the number of people eligible for medical care by millions and millions. The strain of the those numbers would surely do us in. <br>
Let me crawl back the rabbit hole for I will surely retire to Bedlam. God save us. </p>

		<p>Amnesty would hurt American taxpayers. After illegal immigrants are legalized, they&rsquo;d become eligible for federal, state and local taxpayer-funded benefits such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. </p>
<p>Most illegal immigrants don&rsquo;t earn enough to pay taxes. Even when they do, the benefits they receive outweigh the taxes paid.</p>
<p>America is in a virtual depression and Obama wants an amnesty bill passed this year<br>
Amnesty would threaten to bankrupt Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, most illegal immigrants who received amnesty would collect thousands of dollars more in benefits than they paid into the system. </p>
<p>Granting amnesty would increase illegal immigration. Since Congress passed the last &#8220;one-time&#8221; amnesty in 1986, the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. has jumped to more than 12 million. Amnesty sends the message that if you just get into the country, even illegally, you can stay indefinitely. </p>
<p>Amnesty rewards illegal immigrants with the right to live and work in the U.S. That is unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who play by the rules, wait their turn and come in to the U.S. the right way. And selling amnesty to lawbreakers for the price of a fine would demean the value of the greatest honor our country can bestow: citizenship. <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).  So many of those who claim they&rsquo;re &#8220;paying taxes&#8221; are actually getting more than what they paid in a given calendar year back in their tax refund the next spring.  To qualify for the EITC, you have to be a single parent with dependent children under 18 (if they haven&rsquo;t changed the rules since I studied income tax).  Single parents with children under 18&hellip;how many illegal alien Hispanics does that describe?  Find hay in a haystack, if you please.</p>

		<p>First of all, 11 or 12 million is ridiculous; we are talking about far more. The thought of adding a likely 20-30 million illegals, the vast majority being under-educated and under-skilled into a nation that no longer has an industrial base? I question the sanity of anyone who actually believes that Obama &#8220;means well&#8221;. I suspect he will make a run of it, and if he succeeds, it will nullify the border completely. We will essentially be wage slaves, providing services to the looters.  Hello, South Africa!</p>

After all, a hospital is a business as surely as GM and Chrysler and I see a bail out in the future because &#8220;they are just to important to fail&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure more young  people who intended to become doctors will not now do so. Why spend all those years of study and huge expenses only to have one&rsquo;s medical decisions second guessed by a bureaucrat in Washington. Or to have one&rsquo;s income capped by D.C. &#8220;guidelines&#8221; as will surely happen. Hundreds of doctors have already said they will retire early. Obama&rsquo;s plan will simply destroy the best medical system in the world. Only a fool would fail to see this. </p>

<p>WhiteRaven, I think this is a distinct possibility. Obama may just be that narcicistic. And It would surely fail, and see him and all the traitors in a very bad place. If they purposely collapsed the nation, the armed forces would not fight the citizens on their behalf; they could not turn guns on Americans. Because combat troops are about 90%  white male, elite units being even more. <br>
Who&rsquo;s the communist party gonna&rsquo; send out to kill us? Wannabe hippies throwing birkenstocks at us? Will the Marxists parachute Nanci Pelosi Naked onto us? Ye Gads, that&rsquo;s truly scary.<br>
Seriously, it&rsquo;s the one saving grace Americans have; today&rsquo;s marxists have no backbone, no muscle, and no servile army. <br>
Therefore, they&rsquo;ll never contol us.</p>

		<p>This Latino invasion has to be stopped! Average Americans have been hollering for Congress to do something to stop it, and instead we again get nonsense such as this moronic proposal from Schumer and Graham. The Immigration Act of 1965, as championed by Ted Kennedy, had as its goal to change the racial make-up of the US. It has succeeded beyond the expectations of even its supporters. This country is headed toward &#8220;Third World-ism,&#8221; and the head-first plunge into the abyss continues. And it will until this Latino invasion is stopped! </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have to worry about the background checks for the lawbreakers. With the stroke of a pen, our esteemed leader will give a blanket amnesty to all who broke in, presented false documents, stolen IDs and fake names, then went on to bigger and better crimes. These are the people, folks, who will be our next door neighbors unless we fight harder than we&rsquo;ve ever fought before. This is no longer our country. Once the greatest nation on earth, we&rsquo;ve been silent while the enemy has walked in and occupied our home. No President, since Eisenhower has the courage or the will to say &#8220;go home.&#8221; We must make the invaders leave by keeping up our opposition until Washington realizes that unlike them we want our laws enforced. Make them demand <br>
&#8220;enforcement&#8221; rather than &#8220;reform.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve been claiming 11 million illegal immigrants for over 10 years. Probably more like 30 million + about 15 million anchor babies. 45 million people dumped on shoulders of white America. The communists will actually kill the golden goose in order to be crowned King Nothing. Now democrats are crying about death threats as if they&rsquo;re the victims. The founding fathers of this country would have killed most modern politicians for treason anyway. Even if there were all of these death threats as they say, there would be at least a few that would be caught and smeared by the press. Its all lies. Rediculous, unbelievable lies. They can stomp their feet and swear up and down to it and its still a bunch of lies. Imagine what a pathetic loser you would feel like if you had to go through life as a professional liar.    </p>

		<p>How about a RATIONAL look at immigration? Like this one: How many MORE immigrants can this nation safely absorb? We already are suffering from an incredible JOB SHORTAGE   &mdash;   something called massive unemployment being the proof!</p>
<p>The drain on our tax dollars is shown by the many cities up, down and across our country&hellip; cities and municipalities in dire financial straits. Forced to cut back on vital services to its residents.</p>
<p>That bogus claim &#8220;immigrants also pay taxes&#8221;&hellip; rings a bit hollow when you compute how much tax the average illegal immigrant wage earner pays. Given their low wage-earning ability, based on marketable skills and education, claiming the maximum number of dependents&hellip; precious little taxes are collected from illegals. As to sales tax&hellip; same thing. A low wage earner simply does not spend very much&hellip; for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>Yet these people COST taxpayers plenty. For welfare supplements, food stamps, for using the local Emergency Room facilities for medical care, for using public school systems for education of their multitudinous offspring.</p>
<p>Now rest assured Obama, bowing to La Raza and similar Latino pressure groups   &mdash;   will try to cover the illegals under the health care bill. Even if only ordering proffered &#8220;documentation&#8221; to be accepted without question.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said this to my husband for about 5 years now. Every time I hear of some person snapping, such as the man who flew his plane into the IRS office in Austin, TX, etc., it reaffirms my belief that Americans are pushed to the brink as they have never been before. Ordinary good people are backed into a corner over the most ridiculous, unfair, nonsense every day of their lives now, with no recourse. Combine that with several generations of people with no self control, who have never been told &#8216;no&rsquo;, always had exactly what they want (or feel they SHOULD have exactly what they want due to their very existence), and this country is as explosive as I&rsquo;ve ever seen it.</p>
<p>It first came to my attention, as I said, about 5 years ago, when we made a road trip and hubby decided to take along the old antique CB radio for entertainment. Entertainment it was, but not the kind we expected. Every day America, chatting on unrestricted radio waves between themselves fought, screamed, cussed, threatened, spoke disgustingly over every female that they passed, saw, or had contact with. They cussed the politicians, each other, every driver of any vehicle other than a truck, every policy, everything in their world. These truck drivers threatened each other over tiny little differences of opinions, and it was nothing more than a haven of sheer anger and obscenities.We turned it off in 15 minutes, though we randomly checked it at various times with exactly the same results. That is when I discovered how much anger and frustration is out there among every day Americans.</p>
<p>Whoever inherits this country will inherit more anger than anything else.</p>

		<p>The government claims not to know how many illegal aliens we have leeching off us. Yet newspaper articles have consistently put the numbers streaming across the border at roughly 1 million a year. Now multiply the number of years by the last 30   &mdash;   and 30 million ILLEGALS, not counting their anchor babies is a realistic figure.</p>

		<p>When Reagan had his amnesty, it was supposed to be for only 1 million. It resulted in 3.1 immediate amnesties. Up to 25% were acknowledged to be fradulent. Stories of people showing up with a handwritten note from people they supposedly worked for. The INS was under orders to process them fast, so no checking was done.</p>
<p>Over the following years, new mini amnesties were added to &#8220;catch those that fell through the cracks&#8221;. Most were just liars claiming little more than &#8220;The dog ate my application&#8221;. Ultimately we had 5.2 million amnestied.</p>

<p>I agree.  But also no government in the world can defeat its population as long as they have a right to bear arms.  In the US an armed citizenry amounts to an overwhelming force.  I would urge everybody to not let threats against them fool them into thinking they are weak.</p>
<p>Swat teams, military troops&hellip;even if they would direct their arms against their fellow citizens&hellip;&hellip;are no match for 200 million armed adults.  No way.  </p>
<p>History tells us that in the case of insurgents vs governments the insurgents usually always prevail, and they are usually in countries where arms are outlawed.</p>

<p>Cloward-Piven is to the far left what William Pierce was to the right, and that is nothing more than a &#8220;bring it all down man and the pure Phoenix will rise from the ashes to create a perfect society&#8221; mentality.  The problem with this method, for both the Obamaites and William Pierce was that when you play with fire, you never know who is going to get burned.  When you &#8220;bring it all down man,&#8221; you might not like the bird that rises from the ashes to replace it.  </p>

<p>Even if the U.S. Armed Forces were 100% white and of relatively high IQ, say, above average, they would still fire on American citizens if ordered.  The reason is that they&rsquo;re trained to follow orders.  Nothing more.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve obviously never been in the military.  Only a handful would fire on American civilians and that handful would in turn be fired upon by their fellow soldiers&hellip;  <br>

<p>You&rsquo;re obviously separated from reality.  Talk to activists who were in Boston in the 1970s to protest deseg.  They&rsquo;ll tell you that the very same white Boston cops that were their friends the previous evening in a bar, agreeing with the activists that deseg is bad, were the very same white Boston cops who, when ordered by their Chief and their Mayor, fired guns at their &#8220;friends&#8221; the next afternoon when they were engaging in public protests.</p>
