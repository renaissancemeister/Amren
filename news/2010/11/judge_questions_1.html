			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Markon, Washington Post, November 1, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal appellate judge expressed deep skepticism Monday about a Justice Department lawsuit challenging Arizona&rsquo;s new immigration law, leaving uncertain the Obama administration&rsquo;s chances of stopping the law from taking effect.</p>
<p>Judge John T. Noonan Jr. grilled administration lawyers at a hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. He took aim at the core of the Justice Department&rsquo;s argument: that the Arizona statute is &#8220;preempted&#8221; by federal law and is especially troublesome because it requires mandatory immigration status checks in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve read your brief, I&rsquo;ve read the District Court opinion, I&rsquo;ve heard your interchange with my two colleagues, and I don&rsquo;t understand your argument,&#8221; Noonan told deputy solicitor general Edwin S. Kneedler. &#8220;We are dependent as a court on counsel being responsive.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You keep saying the problem is that a state officer is told to do something. That&rsquo;s not a matter of preemption.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I would think the proper thing to do is to concede that this is a point where you don&rsquo;t have an argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The exchange came at a hearing on efforts by the Justice Department to overturn the Arizona law, which empowers police to question people they suspect are in the country illegally and has triggered a fierce national debate. {snip}</p>
<p>With Noonan, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, so bluntly stating his views, legal experts said the government&rsquo;s chances of having the injunction upheld may rest with the other two judges on Monday&rsquo;s panel: Carlos T. Bea and Richard A. Paez.</p>
<p>Bea is also a Republican appointee and tends to vote with the court&rsquo;s conservative wing, which could help Arizona&rsquo;s chances. Paez is a Democratic appointee.</p>
<p>But Bea and Paez are Hispanic, and it is Hispanics who are most upset about the Arizona law. &#8220;Perhaps this is one area where Bea might not vote as a so-called conservative because he himself is an immigrant,&#8221; said Arthur Hellman, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and an expert on the 9th Circuit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whatever the result, the panel&rsquo;s decision is the first step on a long road: legal experts expect the case to reach the Supreme Court. It is unclear when the panel will rule.</p>

		<p>The fact that two of the judges are Hispanic should be completely irrelevant. They are supposed to decide the case on its legal merits, not by any allegiance to their &#8220;people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is there really any hope anymore? It&rsquo;s bad enough that existing immigration laws aren&rsquo;t enforced. Now we have the specter of the courts overturning these laws because of politically-correct appointed judges overturning them.</p>

		<p>First, the Constitution of the United States delegates the power to &#8220;Naturalize&#8221; citizens, not control immigration. Second, since when are state personnel forbidden to enforce federal law. If you commit murder in County X, the county sheriff can arrest you, he doesn&rsquo;t have to wait for a state trooper to come arrest you (because it violates state law and not necessarily a county law/ordinance).</p>

		<p>Them being Hispanic should be irrelevant. They are supposed to be enforcing the American laws and protecting the American people, not their race. <br>
They have to choose, are they American or are they Hispanic? <br>

		<p><i>Second, since when are state personnel forbidden to enforce federal law.</i></p>
<p>There have been a number of cases where state and local law enforcement have worked with the federal DEA to enforce laws against medical marijuana clinics in states where such clinics were legalized by popular votes. The feds have no problem getting everyone involved when it comes to cracking down on the liberties of American citizens. But when it comes to illegal aliens, then the feds look the other way and the local cops are supposed to sit back and do nothing.</p>
