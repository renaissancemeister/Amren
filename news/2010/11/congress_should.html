<h1><a href="https://biggovernment.com/mbachmann/2010/11/29/congress-should-investigate-pigford-ii-claims-before-funding-them/">Congress Should Investigate Pigford II Claims Before Funding Them</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rep. Michele Bachmann, Big Government, November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I urge my colleagues to consider what the Claims Settlement Act truly presents before voting on the bill this week. This legislation includes over a billion dollars to settle the Pigford II discrimination claims with black farmers. Unfortunately, Pigford is rife with fraudulent claims and to settle before an investigation can take place does the American taxpayer a disservice. Justice should be served to those who experienced discrimination, but settlement funds should only go to those wronged.</p>
<p>By the National Black Farmers Association&rsquo;s own data, only 18,000 black farmers exist in the United States, but under Pigford II 94,000 claims of racial discrimination have been filed thus far. A number of individuals involved in Pigford, ranging from USDA officials to black farmers themselves, are ready and willing to appear as witnesses before Congress to bring these allegations into the light.</p>
<p>As a consistent fighter against out-of-control government spending, I cannot stand idly by as I see the United States taxpayer put on the hook for even a dime to Pigford II. It&rsquo;s time for Congress to fully investigate the Pigford II claims because the numbers just don&rsquo;t add up.</p>

		<p>I was reading an article about this topic that stated black farmer were actully getting more loans than white farmers  looking at the total number of farmers. I&rsquo;m not sure how anyone could verify this claim but it would be interesting to know just how much money was already given to black farmers and how much good it did. </p>
<p>Over the years I have known of many blacks that did get business loans and for the most part it was like throwing money away. </p>

		<p>Michele Bachmann is obviously a Hater and a White Supremacist, who is motivated by Evil White Racist Hate.  There can be no other explanation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Abe Foxman told me, anyway.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time someone stood up to this sort of fraud committed at taxpayers&rsquo; expense. It happens in lots of areas of government and I&rsquo;m grateful that senators are starting to take notice. God bless Mrs Bachmann for being the one to do it.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, White Man.  A black (or Hispanic) doesn&rsquo;t need proof of white racism.  All they have to do is simply make accusations and you&rsquo;re down for, poof, no more free speech, and you will give them all your money for the rest of your life.</p>

		<p>I have faith in our government. Any one denied a claim under Pigford II will be able to reapply under Pigford III. After all the newly elected Republicans don&rsquo;t want anyone one to think they are racist. There might even be a need for Pigford IV and V for future generations of Black farmers yet to be born.</p>

		<p>Pigford II was set up for those that missed the Pigford I deadline.  How often does that happen that those who couldn&rsquo;t get in line for free money are given another chance?  Congress approve $100mm for Pigford II, and somehow the cap is now over $1.2bn!  This is not small change.  And for what?  Note the allege discrimination occurred in all counties including those offices that were 100% black.  And no individual has been accused of discrimination, it is only the FDA at the Federal level.  No one fired, no one accused, no one found guilty.  I need not say this has been poorly covered by the popular press.  Our government is out of control, and taxpayer money as well as a sense of equity has been trampled by the need to buy votes.</p>
