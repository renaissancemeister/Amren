<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So you&rsquo;re a white supremacist who wants to raise some money for your local private school. What do you do? Host a barbecue, of course. That&rsquo;s one of the fundraising tactics that hate group Council of Conservative Citizens uses to pump thousands of dollars into two private Mississippi academies, the Southern Poverty Law Center has found.</p>
<p>What kinds of schools do white supremacists like? Virtually all-white schools. And that&rsquo;s just the type of schools that Calhoun Academy in Calhoun City, Miss., and Carroll Academy in Carrollton, Miss. are. Calhoun boasts four non-white students; Carroll has only one. Scroll through the photos on both schools&rsquo; websites and you&rsquo;ll see only white children; Carroll Academy happens to be the proud home of the Rebels. When contacted by the SPLC, the heads of both schools refused to speak critically of the Council of Conservative Citizens. Carroll&rsquo;s headmaster added, &#8220;they have their right to feel how they feel.&#8221; That&rsquo;s a chilling statement coming from an educator.</p>
<p>As Change.org reported earlier this week, both schools are accredited by the Mississippi Association of Independent Schools, which certifies private schools in Mississippi and surrounding states.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s some news: Sponsors of the MAIS, proudly displayed on the association&rsquo;s homepage, are household names including Wilson Sports, Russell Athletic, Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company and Mississippi Farm Bureau Insurance. &#8220;Our major sponsors help to make it possible for us to provide quality academic and athletic events for our students, teachers and administrators,&#8221; the MAIS writes glowingly. White Supremacist 101, brought to you by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wilson Sports?</p>
<p>From funding sporting events to sponsoring science fairs and spelling bees, Wilson, Russell Athletic and other brands are supporting the MAIS, which in turn accredits, funds and sponsors Calhoun and Carroll. By accrediting schools funded by a hate group, the MAIS is helping prolong a legacy of hatred and ignorance. And Wilson Sports, Russell Athletic and the other sponsors are unwittingly aiding white supremacists in molding a new generation of young minds. (The MAIS did not respond to queries made by the Southern Poverty Law Center or by Change.org.)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let this injustice go on any longer. Join Change.org members in telling Wilson Sporting Goods and other businesses to Stop Sponsoring Racist, Anti-Gay Schools.<br>

		<p>Let me make sure I&rsquo;m following this correctly.</p>
<p>According to the article, Wilson Sports sponsors the Mississippi Association of Independent Schools, which certifies private schools in Mississippi and surrounding states. The MAIS accredited two schools for whom the CofCC held a barbecue fundraiser. The school didnt do anything. The MAIS didnt do anything. And Wilson Sports didn&rsquo;t do anything. But Carol Scott doesn&rsquo;t like one of the groups who held a <i>fundraiser</i> for the school. Is this what Carol Scott has her knickers in a wad over? Really??? Pardon me, but she sounds a little crazy.</p>

		<p>Okay I am confused.  Just because a &#8220;racist&#8221; organization supports something, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the supported organization &#8220;racist.&#8221;  The two schools have non-white students, so they are not totally white anyway.  </p>
<p>Just because someone receives money from a certain group, doesn&rsquo;t mean you can automatically lump them in with said group.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very glad to hear there are still two private schools in Mississippi where segregation has endured (well, almost).  Unfortunately, however, those businesses mentioned in the article probably don&rsquo;t know about the affiliations of these private schools.  The writer of this article makes a big stretch when he says that these organizations are at fault for supporting an accredidation service which has the audacity to accredate two private schools which - gasp! - only have a few minority children!  AND they&rsquo;re supported by the Council of Conservative Citizens!  Oh, what to do!  Call in the diversity police!  Freedom of association is dead in this country.  We have very few freedoms these days.</p>
<p>If I ever find myself living in Calhoun City or Carrollton (which, admittedly, is very unlikely), I&rsquo;ll know where to send my children.  I&rsquo;ve already decided I&rsquo;ll dress them up as Jews and send them to a Yeshiva if I have to.  I didn&rsquo;t think there was any other school where all the children are white.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What kinds of schools do white supremacists like? Virtually all-white schools&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time and well overdue. Doesn&rsquo;t nearly every large foundation give money and show favor to schools and projects dedicated specifically to people of color? Their &#8216;hate&rsquo; has become virtually the curriculum at every school in the nation. Doesn&rsquo;t nearly every university, from Harvard to Howard, sponsor private interest groups and the private interests of students and &#8216;communities&rsquo; of color, while offering white students zip, except the title of &#8216;privileged&rsquo; or oppressor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well overdue and no doubt does not go nearly far enough. Just call it &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; to make up for wasted time and effort.  </p>

		<p>In San Francisco, there is a private school that is mostly white and a few asians named Live Oak.White parents send their kids there because of how afrocentric and anti white the public schools are, and they still pay the highest property taxes in the nation to support them, but they shouldnt be blamed for that.What they really should do is at least TRY to change how the public schools are run.</p>

		<p>I agree!  I want to stop racist schools, too, especially ones who have programs bashing whites, bashing our history, blaming us for everything wrong with the world, and having chapters only for blacks, hispanics, etc, yet not allowing them for us.</p>

		<p>So if a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; owns a home and pays property taxes, which is how our &#8220;public&#8221; schools are funded, does that mean that the Department of Education supports White Supremacy? Or if a parent who is a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; is engaged in their child&rsquo;s education and wants to help their child&rsquo;s school keep costs down and programs available for ALL the students at their child&rsquo;s school does that make the school and/or it&rsquo;s accrediting association a &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221; group? The obvious answer is no it doesn&rsquo;t, but the SPLC in it&rsquo;s omnipotent wisdom would like you to believe that it is a spider web of conspiracy by White America to keep blacks and mexicans down. </p>

		<p>I suspect that the non whites in the two schools are fine examples of their respective races with thoughtful, thinking parents that care what happens to their children&hellip;.I would welcome such people but alas, they are few and far between accounting for the very few in these schools.</p>

		<p> Yeah they want to make sure these kids don&rsquo;t compete in the national spelling bee. They would find that these two schools will absolutely smoke their public schools students and that would be bad for their self esteem. Why do parents home school their kids? It&rsquo;s an awful burden on the parent who has to stay home and care for the kids instead of earning an income. They do it because the public schools are a festering slimepit of political correctness that does not even bother to be anything but a jobs program for unqualified minorities.<br>
 I wish they open a school here in Texas.</p>

		<p>Everyone is outraged by these incursions into our freedom of expression and association. Where have they been all these years. Were was everyone when the Will of Steven Girard was savaged when the Girard College, bequeathed as a free preparatory school for &#8220;Fatherless White Boys&#8221;, was forcibly integrated? Race agitator par excellence Cecil B. Moore a so called attorney and a 50s version of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, lead his &#8220;demonstrators&#8221; in a siege on the School. These thugs surrounded the high walls of the school for weeks singing &#8220;Jingle Bells, Shotgun Shells,over the wall we go&#8221;. White Philadelphian were appalled that the courts would violate a sacred will but nobody really did anything.</p>
<p>I dont know how many White kids are there today, I suspect not many since Black fatherless boys certainly hold supremacy in numbers, except that in his will, Girard was referring to boys whose fathers has died. Moore had a street and several schools named after him.</p>
<p>No one did anything when Sharpton totally destroyed the career and life of Steven Begonis with the phony Tawana Brawley case or when the same Sharpton caused the fire and deaths of several non-Black people in Harlem by exhorting with Blacks to violence against the Jewish owner of Freddy&rsquo;s fashion Barn.</p>
<p>Everyone was appalled when riots broke out in Crown Heights in Brooklyn 20 years ago when Blacks ran through the streets attacking Hassidic Jews; resulting in the death of a rabbinical student Yankel Rosenbaum who was stabbed to death in the streets by Black thug Lemrick Nelson. Nelson was acquitted by a Black Jury and took all the jurors and his lawyers to lunch to celebrate his acquittal. During those same riots an innocent driver named Vincent Graziosi was shot to death in his car while stopped at a red light because he had a beard and was mistaken for a Hassid by the thugs who attacked him. Nobody did anything. During that rioting the police under orders from then Mayor David Dinkins pretty much let the rioters have their way. The whole thing started with the tragic but accidental death of a 4 year old Black boy who was struck by a car. The driver was driving the Grand Rabbi of the Lubavitcher Hassidic community when he lost control of the vehicle which ended up on a sidewalk killing the boy.</p>
<p>We were also appalled at the acquittal of OJ Simpson who butchered two White people one of whom was his wife and was acquitted by a Black jury in another case of nullification.</p>
<p> For well over 50 years we&rsquo;ve been appalled to an appalling degree over the, for want of a better word, &#8220;pogrom&#8221; against White people by Blacks with the pogrom being supported by the inaction of our &#8220;leadership&#8221;. THe above mentioned incidents are but a drop in the bucket. I could write for the next six months.<br>
Remember the line: </p>
<p>&#8220;Then they came for me but there was no one left to stand up&#8221;.<br>
