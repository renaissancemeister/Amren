<h1>First Americans &#8216;Reached Europe Five Centuries Before Columbus Voyages&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fiona Govan, Telegraph (London), Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scientists tracing the genetic origins of an Icelandic family believe the first American arrived in Europe around the 10th century, a full five hundred years before Columbus set off on his first voyage of discovery in 1492. </p>
<p>Norse sagas suggest the Vikings discovered the Americas centuries before Columbus and the latest data seems to support the hypothesis that they may have brought American Indians back with them to northern Europe. </p>
<p>Research indicates that a woman from the North American continent probably arrived in Iceland some time around 1000AD leaving behind genes that are reflected in about 80 Icelanders today. </p>
<p>Investigators discovered the genes could be traced to common ancestors in the south of Iceland, near the Vatnaj Kull glacier in around 1710 ruling out initial theories that they may have arrived via Asia. </p>
<p>&#8220;As the island was practically isolated from the 10th century onwards, the most probable hypothesis is that these genes correspond to an Amerindian woman who was taken from America by the Vikings some time around the year 1000,&#8221; Carles Lalueza-Fox, of the Pompeu Fabra university in Spain, said. </p>
<p>A Viking settlement at L&rsquo;Anse aux Meadows, in the eastern Canadian region of Terranova, is thought to date to the 11th century. </p>
<p>Researchers said they would keep trying to determine when the Amerindian genes first arrived in Iceland and would seek to link them to burial remains in the Americas. </p>
<p>The genetic research, made public by Spain&rsquo;s Centre for Scientific Research, was due to be published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. </p>

								<h2>Do the Beothuk Live On in Iceland?</h2>
						<p>A team of European researchers says the discovery of what appears to be a strain of First Nations DNA among a small group of Icelanders may represent the survival, at least genetically, of the Beothuk, victims of Canadian history&rsquo;s most tragic cultural extinction. The scientists have linked their discovery to Viking voyages to Canada about 1,000 years ago</p>
<p>The DNA discovery may also help solve one of the country&rsquo;s most enduring mysteries: the identity of the so-called &#8220;skraelings&#8221; of the medieval Viking sagas   &mdash;   natives whose attacks forced Leif Ericcson and his fellow Norse colonists to abandon their landmark New World settlement a millennium ago at present-day L&rsquo;Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland.</p>
<p>The study, published in the latest issue of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, was authored by three anthropologists and geneticists from the University of Iceland and a paleo-DNA specialist from Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings reveal that a mysterious Icelandic mitochondrial DNA sequence (that we named the C1e lineage), carried by more than 80 Icelanders, can be traced through the female line to four ancestors born in Iceland around 1700,&#8221; study co-author Agnar Helgason said. &#8220;There is good reason to believe that the C1e lineage arrived in Iceland several hundreds of years before 1700.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting that the newly identified DNA type does not appear to be of European origin, Helgason says further evidence suggests it most likely derives from &#8220;the great human genealogical tree through the female line that has, to date, only been found in Native Americans&#8221;   &mdash;   the aboriginal nations of the Americas.</p>
<p>But the distinctive C1e &#8220;clade&#8221; does not precisely match any existing DNA profile among native groups. And the early origin of this unusual Icelandic genetic strain has led the researchers to a startling theory about ancient events at the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Newfoundland, where archeologists have proven that Norse seafarers from Greenland and Iceland established a short-lived colony at L&rsquo;Anse aux Meadows 1,000 years ago. The research team suspects the Norse kidnapped one or more of the hostile natives they encountered during their colonization effort. A captive female skraeling is then presumed to have become the matriarch of a line of Norse-native descendants that can be traced to the 80 Icelanders recently identified as having the C1e DNA profile.</p>
<p>Following John Cabot&rsquo;s landmark voyage to Newfoundland in 1498, the island&rsquo;s Beothuk nation clashed with a succession of would-be colonizers from Portugal, France and Britain and was ravaged by disease. The last known survivor of her people, an artistically gifted Beothuk woman named Shanawdithit, died in St. John&rsquo;s in 1829.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings raise the possibility that there was in fact contact between the Icelandic Vikings and the Native Americans, which led to a Native American woman carrying the C1e lineage being brought to Iceland,&#8221; said Helgason. &#8220;If this is the case, then the contemporary Icelanders carrying the C1e lineage would be descended through the direct female line from the first Native American to travel to Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Iceland is not really, by any geographical reality, in Europe. It&rsquo;s a North Atlantic island,  a long way from Europe.    But it&rsquo;s very  interesting that if this Amerindian group died out in America, their genes were preserved  <i>by whites  </i>who took one of them home to Eur  &mdash;  - uh, I mean Iceland.</p>
<p>PS. I noticed the odd, extremely Politically Correct racial terminology and delicate tiptoeing  that was employed so laboriously in the Canadian article.  Apparently  the word &#8220;white&#8221; was just more than they could bring themselves to say.   </p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s OK. I&rsquo;ll say it for them:  Vikings were &#8220;white&#8221;. So there!  It wasn&rsquo;t really so hard.</p>

		<p>Luckily it&rsquo;s just 80 people.</p>
<p>Why are researchers neglecting to investigate how mtDNA haplogroup X got to North America 11,000+ years ago?  Haplogroup X originates in the Middle East and is found in Cacausian women.  Since women can&rsquo;t reproduce on their own Cacuasian women obviously came with men to North America.  The highest frequency and diversity of genes usually shows where they originated.  Haplogroup X has it&rsquo;s highest frequency in North America in modern day Quebec suggesting Haplogroup X arrived via the Atlantic Ocean which would mean they came with Caucasian men since only Causian men lived in Europe at the time.</p>

		<p>I suppose that the facts in these articles are of some importance in biological history. What interests me is the liberal ideological bias of the Canadian article. Note the statements:&#8221;the Beothuk, victims of Canadian history&rsquo;s most tragic cultural extinction&#8221;, &#8220;Native Americans*&#8221;, &#8220;the Norse kidnapped one or more of the hostile natives&#8221;. Liberal hatred of western civilization surfaces in any liberal communication.</p>
<p>*The term, &#8220;Native American&#8221; is used by liberals as a propaganda synonym for &#8220;aborigine&#8221; to imply that white men who are born in the U.S., do not morally belong in the U.S. <br/>

<p>Canada&rsquo;s most tragic cultural extinction is the future extinction of traditional, Anglo- and French-Canadian culture, which will inevitably come if the vicious tide of third world immigration is not stopped very soon.</p>

		<p>This article is a very interesting acknowledgment of the ancient sea voyages which took place centuries before Columbus.</p>
<p>However, the article may be only the tip of the iceberg for most Americans.</p>
<p>Evidence of ancient voyages which had long been documented has given way to new research which may prove that sea farers from as far as ancient Egypt and Persia sailed to Mesoamerica over 3,000 years ago at a time when these nations were predominantly Caucasian.</p>
<p>Further evidence suggests that Indians from the North American continent may not only be the oldest race of man in the world, but are the genetic ascendants of the white race.</p>
<p>Although this most likely fact may appear evident to some white Americans, it should not imply a call for whites to miscengenate as racial integrity is crucial to the balance, high standard, and integrity if white civilization.</p>

<p>This is why I use the term &#8220;Amerind&#8221; myself and I supposedly have some Amerind ancestry.</p>
<p>Amerinds are no more &#8220;native&#8221; than Europeans.  My understanding is that they came here from Siberia, going across the Bering Strait.  I guess you could say that originally they were Asians.</p>
<p>They just got here before Europeans did, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>There they go again!  What&rsquo;s this about CULTURAL extinction?  Are they not lamenting the Beothuks&rsquo; RACIAL extinction?  Oh, no! Race is unmentionable.  To Marxists, culture is everything.</p>
<p>What the  PC Canadian article is lamenting is the loss of that precious Beothuk &#8220;culture&#8221;. This, despite the fact that the article is about the preservation of their GENES in a Nordic population, not the preservation of their culture.</p>
<p>Btw, until right now, I never heard of these &#8220;artistically gifted&#8221; Beothuks and their admirable culture. Of course, the reasons given (mere speculations) for their mysterious  disappearance are the ravages of disease (brought by whites) and clashes with would-be colonizers (whites).  Obviously, it&rsquo;s all the fault of whites.  Who else?   </p>
<p>Since so little is actually known, no hint is made of the possibility that they may have been exterminated in clashes with their fellow &#8220;First Nations&#8221;  [&#8220;Indians&#8221; in Old American English]&hellip; who would certainly have outnumbered any of those evil Europeans  who brought disease, war, and capitalism to the peaceful New World. </p>

		<p>This whole article is nothing but nonsense.  No, the Vikings (pre-white, same gene pool as the ancient Greeks, Aryans, Egyptians), did not take any of the red race to Europe/Iceland.  Some of red race were already there BEFORE the Vikings.  The first settlers of Europe were the Eskimos, the first human beings prior to the appearance of the colored races and the white race.  The Eskimos roamed this planet for 500,000 years before the appearance of the colored races.  The appearance of light hair and eyes were not evolutionary.   In other words, those features did not appear from the genetic material native to this planet but came from another source.  The white race presently possess the highest quality of genetic material.  </p>

		<p>While interesting, it doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything to race activism.  As American Nationalist wrote, we have evidences, including the expiditions of Thor Henderalh, The Rah Expeditions, that showed that Meditteranean people could have and likely did migrate to the Americas during the ancient epoch.  Genetic mapping is just beginning to prove this.  So the idea of Mongoloid only sources for Amerinds is not only untrue, but likely only a fraction of the actual prehistoric population of the Americas.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Beothuk nation&#8221;  Here is how words are used to politically change reality.  The Beothuk &#8220;nation&#8221; was a tribe.  A nation by definition would have a civil structure with written laws, public policies, taxes, and other hallmarks of a nation.  The laxity of language has been seized upon by groups like Amerinds via indulgent white management that has allowed these &#8220;little marks of pride&#8221; to exist until they carry meanings that have no place in reality, but serve political purposes today.</p>

		<p>Why does the &#8220;research team&#8221; mentioned in the Ottawa Citizen automatically assume that the one or more indians that ended up in Iceland were kidnapped? They have absolutely no way of knowing that, and it is equally likely that a Viking and a skraeling made a love connection and decided to stay together when the Vikings decamped. </p>
<p>The presumption that kidnapping was involved seems to be meant to tie into the overall narrative being spun here which is that the Beothuk people were treated terribly at the hands of Europeans. Which may or may not be true, but it certainly is not the case in this story, where there&rsquo;s no proof that the indian(s) that went with the Vikings back to Iceland were taken against their will. These biases have to be fought at every turn apparently, or they get interjected as a matter of course by multicult &#8220;researchers.&#8221; Academia is truly hostile to white Europeans.</p>

__  __  __  __  __   </p>
<p>Exactly. Thank you for a very good point. It is too distant in time, and too completely undocumented by any known facts or knowledge, to make such assumptions. Pure speculation!  All we know is that she (or her genes) got there. Somehow. </p>
<p>[Maybe it was the child of an inter-racial match that was brought back. As an example, many half-American orphans were brought to the USA from Vietnam. Should future historians assume that their mothers were kidnapped and forcibly taken to America?]</p>
<p>The woman could have been sold to them as a slave. She could have sought refuge among them from the wrath of her own tribe. She could have simply married a Viking. There are countless possibilities.  Why automatically assume that whites were guilty  of kidnapping? (and extermination)  </p>
<p>Oh, but it would be politically incorrect to assume that peace-loving &#8220;First Nations&#8221; sold slaves or practiced violence, so it must have been the white people&rsquo;s fault.  Who else?  Everyone who&rsquo;s been to college  knows that Europeans invented violence.</p>

<p>Even if all historic claims to primacy of place in America were nothing more than fantasy, then I hold to MY fantasy, based on the &#8216;science&rsquo; of the Solutrean Hypothesis- White Men were here first- this is our land. Raus. End of story.</p>

		<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t surprised. Vikings are known for their slave trade (not necessarily limited to Europe, extending as far as to Middle East and Central Asia over Southern Russia). </p>
<p>By the way, Icelanders are not &#8220;pure&#8221; Vikings but an amalgamation of Nordics from Norway and Celtics from Ireland and Scotland. This is the reason why Iceland and Norway have much more dark and red hair then Sweden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been jokingly told that Vikings took all beautiful women from Ireland away so only the ugliest remained.</p>
<p>Iceland has obviously non-European influence (Inuit or something else, I don&rsquo;t know, mostly among women), just look at the famous Björk and her strange features or search on Google.</p>
<p>They reached North America around 1000 so it&rsquo;s quite normal if they took some women with them back to Iceland.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, but they didn&rsquo;t get them all! </p>
<p>In point of fact, that was actually done by the Danes, when they conquered England under Canute. They shipped the best-looking women back to Denmark.  </p>
<p>That could be a reason why Vikings were such noticeably fine specimens (and the ancisnts remarked on it). They practiced eugenics back then, without even knowing it. Nor were they inhibited by Christian or Moslem teachings. They did what was racially beneficial for them, without guilt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting explanation about red hair, which is quite rare in Sweden. Most Swedish blonds are pale Baltic  blonds. But I remember one seaside village which had a number of redheads. Just there!  I wondered if they were descendents of slaves/captives/wives  brought back by the Vikings.</p>

<p>My point is not necessarily scientific but it seems working also Central Europe too: <br/>
While Northern Germany is almost purely Nordic (probably even more than mixed parts of Norway and Denmark), Southern Germany has an ancient Celtic substratum explaining increasing number of dark and reddish people, however mostly with light and mixed eyes like in Scotland, Ireland and western England. </p>
<p>Norwegians and Icelanders carry a lot of R1a (R1a,R1b and I are distributed nearly equal 1:1:1) which is also very rare in the west of Poland, in Germany just below 6%, Sweden is ~50% I). Although they are known for their attacks in Western Europe, they probably took Slavic slaves with them and interbred. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Agreed.  My point too is not scientific, just personal observation. I have  tried to observe carefully but have not noticed much, or any, difference between North and South Germany.  I&rsquo;m sure there was once a difference, in past centuries.  I suspect that due to the upheavals of two massive world wars and  millions of Displaced Persons, plus industrialization, and political division, the population in the north and east (especially) is pretty scrambled.  In the Ruhr/Rhein valley also.  And in a metropolis like Berlin you see everybody from everywhere, just like New York or London.</p>
<p>But there is indeed a Celtic underlay in Southern Germany that is occasionally noticeable.  Last year,  on a suburban train platform near Stuttgart,  I came upon one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.  She had milky skin and gorgeous red hair   &mdash;   a Celtic goddess!  (She was the real thing - not out of a bottle!)   As in Sweden, there aren&rsquo;t a great many redheads in Germany  (certainly not like Ireland/Scotland), but perhaps a few more. </p>
<p>I have seen maps showing genetic distribution in about 1870.  Today, those are meaningless.   Blonds seem about evenly distributed everywhere - and are not that frequent either   &mdash;    not so much as many people would expect for Germany.  Again, just my observation.</p>

___</p>
<p>Not many as in Scandinavia or Finland (in percentage, of course) but still many more than other countries in Europe (probably except Estonia which is also very blond).</p>
<p>My estimations:</p>
<p>Sweden&gt; Finland&gt; Estonia&gt; Norway&gt; Denmark&gt;<br/>
Germany (without Austria and Switzerland)&gt; Latvia&Lithuania;&gt; Poland&gt; Netherlands&gt; England&Flanders; (not Britain)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know how the situation in other countries is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to exclude Turks, Arabs, Italians, former Yugoslavians, Poles, Albanians and Russians while observing.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Correct.  I agree.  By &#8220;everywhere&#8221;, I was referring only to within Germany.</p>
<p>As for Scandinavia, the percentages won&rsquo;t last long, with the wave of immigration that is under way. In another generation, the population will be transformed. </p>
<p>The historical &#8220;Scandinavians&#8221; will be overwhelmed, and (who knows?) it may even be illegal to refer to them, or to teach real history about them.   The type of people who are coming in have no concept of (or respect for) objectivity or individual freedom. So some type of repressive dictatorship seems inevitable. As in France, the naive Swedish leftists think they will transform the newcomers into good Swedes. But no, the rigid and unassimilable newcomers will transform the Swedes into themselves.</p>
<p>In another generation, once they get sufficient numbers and acquire political clout, they will throw open the borders to the teeming masses of the Third World.  These small countries, with only a few millions, will be utterly overwhelmed.  </p>
<p>How can these naive Marxist fools be so blind to that?<br/>
Well, for one thing, they have been made ashamed of being white. They think that eliminating whiteness will be a good thing. They have swallowed the pill.  Just look at the absurd fuss that the fawning Norwegian Nobel team made over Obama   &mdash;   giving him a Nobel prize FOR DOING NOTHING! Nothing except being a mulatto and setting a wonderful example to the world.</p>

<p>We are obviously off the topic but I can&rsquo;t resist more:</p>
<p>What can I start with? Sweden is a dead country. Highest refugee and asylum seeker ratio per capita (from Iraq, Somalia and other 3rd world countries that Sweden has nothing to do with), the most radical leftist government and population, most promiscuous women who go to the remotest parts of the world to find partners&hellip;. </p>
<p>When I visit my sister up there (yes, she&rsquo;s immigrant too, but dont&rsquo; worry, with master&rsquo;s degree), I see there is absolutely no hope for them. Parts of the large cities like Stockholm and Malmö have already been transformed and become no-go areas for police and native Swedes. Veiled women are much more visible than in the Middle East. </p>
<p>And what are the young Swedes busy with? Sweden&rsquo;s next popstar, their sex partners in South America, Africa or Asia, useless fashion stuff, etc&hellip; Either they think the country will never collapse or they are simply ignorant of the fact that their end is near.</p>
<p>The forefathers of them, terror and fear from the north, must be spinning in their graves.<br/>

<p>I think Europe will see a reversal of the traditional arrangement of races.</p>
<p>In the future multi-racial Europa, the whitest countries will be in the south and the darkest in the north. The people will ALL be mulattos to some degree (and various other mixtures for which we haven&rsquo;t names), but they will grow blacker as you go north. Scandinavia will be the blackest. If you want to see really white people, you will have to go to Turkey or Iran.  Whites will still exist there,  but no longer in Europe. </p>
<p>In North America, if you want to see white people, you will have to go to Mexico.  Whites will still exist there too, as a small but privileged group, though they will have to pretend to be mestizos.</p>

<p>They have forgotten their forefathers.  These countries have been &#8220;drugged&#8221; with prosperity and propaganda, reinforced by what they are taught in the schools.</p>
<p>Through it all, these countries are prosperous and their people live well. They just have to keep their mouths shut and not resist, and they will be allowed to have comfortable lives (until they die and are replaced with the new models). </p>
<p>It seems that prosperity has been used as a drug, an opiate that (accompanied by media)  lulls them and pacifies them, and numbs them against the pain of death, while their governments (or whoever controls their governments!) engineer their replacement   &mdash;   all the while assuring them them that this is a good thing and something to be &#8220;celebrated&#8221;.  Certainly by all virtuous and decent people!</p>
<p>The Swedes, wanting to be &#8220;virtuous and decent people&#8221;, numbly comply with their genocide. </p>
