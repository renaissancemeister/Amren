<h1>Bishop Brady Shakes Things Up For Lunch</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tara Ballenger, Concord Monitor, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kendall Russo didn&rsquo;t sit with her friends at lunch yesterday. The Bishop Brady High School junior hadn&rsquo;t had a falling out with her buddies  &mdash;  she was assigned to sit at a table with a dozen kids she didn&rsquo;t know. In fact, every student in the school dined with strangers yesterday, in an effort by a senior history class to help the school break social barriers and shake up our tendency to only hang out and talk with the people we know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Mix It Up at Lunch Day, and over 5,000 schools across the country participated yesterday. Sponsored by the Southern Poverty Law Center, it&rsquo;s meant to show students of all grade levels that they may have more in common with the people they don&rsquo;t talk to than they think.</p>
<p>The day was planned by seniors from Dee Treybig&rsquo;s history class, &#8220;The Holocaust: Facing History and Ourselves,&#8221; who have spent the semester learning about the worst possible outcomes of only embracing those you know: exclusion, racism, xenophobia, genocide. They thought Bishop Brady students would jump at the idea of meeting new people. It&rsquo;s a small school, and because there is little ethnic diversity, there were no racial or cultural divides to overcome.</p>
<p>It was not as easy as they thought to get people to break down the invisible walls that kids  &mdash;  and adults  &mdash;  construct around themselves and the groups they associate with. After students shuffled in and sat at the table with the balloon that matched the color of an X that had been marked on their hand, there were a lot of blank stares, tight smiles and hurried eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;People didn&rsquo;t want to go outside their group, and they didn&rsquo;t know how,&#8221; said senior A.J. Anderson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s disappointing,&#8221; said senior Ali Nemcovich, &#8220;you think of your school as open and accepting, but at the end of the day, people are still sitting with people they know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lecia Brooks, the outreach director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that is normal. Even in small schools, with no race or class differences, it&rsquo;s hard to get over the hurdle of &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Treybig said that&rsquo;s all part of the lesson for her students: Change comes slowly, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t worth fighting for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today reinforced that change is scary,&#8221; said Treybig. &#8220;To fight intolerance, we have to understand that.&#8221;<br>

<p>Well, this is really surprising; the last time I just wandered over to a total stranger in the local Arby&rsquo;s and sat across from her, we had a grand old time. This was despite the fact that &ldquo;she&rdquo; was an angry and obese post-op transsexual &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; of mixed Hmong and Latino background, and wearing a tie-dyed &ldquo;I Love Obama&rdquo; muumuu and some flip-flops. Once the initial &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; were broken down, we discovered that we had a lot in common, such as our compatible desire to breath oxygen and a preference for Arby&rsquo;s potato cakes over their curly fries. Why, it went so well that I and it decided that we should get married, and then start adopting Haitian babies with communicable disease together as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>Diversity really is a strength and we all just need to give it a chance and have a &ldquo;Mix It Up at Lunch&rdquo;  Life!!!</p>

		<p>This is important: &ldquo;The Holocaust: Facing History and Ourselves,&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Our enemies use the Holocaust to force White Children to believe that they are all little Nazis, and the only cure is continual immersion in stories about the horrors of Auschwitz.  &#8220;You would probably do to the oppressed and marginalized African Americans, all of whom would be &#8216;distinguished, esteemed, and renowned&rsquo; without your discriminating against them,  what the Nazis did to the Jews, if you had a chance and if you don&rsquo;t continually search yourself for unacknowledged biases, prejudices, and latent racism.  We are the ones who can help you, and our help is mandatory.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
There is no such thing as forgiveness in Elite Liberalism.  All is the Jewish system of atonement- and Whites are the ones who must do the atoning for all of history&rsquo;s misery.</p>
<p>White Children who are confronted with the Holocaust should immediately change the subject to the atoning and reparations needed for the Southern Holocaust of Illegal Reconstruction I.  Sumner, Stevens, and Wilson were Nazis.<br>

The fact that they have to make kids mingle with kids who are different from them only proves how unnatural the action is.</p>
<p>Why would I want to have a conversation with someone who is different from me or even my polar opposite? Why would I want to talk to someone if I had to speak in guarded terms, risk offending or worse, angering them?</p>
<p>I chose the people I want to be with because I know they&rsquo;re not going to be confrontational or hyper-sensitive to my opinions.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in these mix-up situations such as at work, I&rsquo;m polite but I say very little and I keep my opinions to myself. And I&rsquo;m not simply talking about race, but also ethnicty, politics, and sex. </p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s no racial or cultural differences to &#8220;overcome,&#8221; then what&rsquo;s the point of all this?  What &#8220;intolerance&#8221; are they &#8220;fighting&#8221; in this case?  It sounds like the SPLC just gets its kicks out of forcing people who don&rsquo;t like each other to associate.  As usual, their attempts were a total flop.</p>

		<p>Here is Steve Sailer commenting on a curious trait of the SPLC:   </p>
<p>&#8220;The Freudian concept of projection is pretty useful. For example, the Southern Poverty Law Center is constantly enraged about &#8216;hate&rsquo; among white people. Yet the highest paid hate-stokers of the SPLC &hellip; are about as white as their counterparts in the [K], just much more lucratively compensated.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;For pictures of the SPLC&rsquo;s highest-paid employees, see Watching the Watchdogs&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/242ttjl" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/242ttjl</a></p>
<p>Of course, we don&rsquo;t have a picture of the SPLC hierarchy eating lunch.  Maybe THAT&rsquo;s the time when they &#8220;mix it up&#8221;?  Ya think?<br>

		<p>Social groups in a school are simply how humans naturally coalesce, like a mini-tribe. A school is like a country in miniature. New kids who come into a system alone will gravitate to one of the groups, and will come to be part of that group. Females generally form the cores of groups, whereas males tend to be rovers (single males will oftentimes form their own groups based on common interests), and females will then rope their chosen males into their own circle. Conversely, drama and shunning are how females shunt a given male away from a given group. It&rsquo;s all biology and instinct, built into our DNA, although nobody involved thinks of it this way; if it didn&rsquo;t exist, there would be chaos.</p>
<p>However&hellip; a whole clump of new kids who knew each other previously would naturally stick together. This is similar to how a given type of immigrants, while not a problem in small numbers, do become a problem once they reach a critical mass.</p>

		<p>Treybig should have said, &#8220;Forced Change is Scary&#8221;</p>
<p>I will extend the hand of friendship to anyone but surely we all have the right to associate with whom we want to and be free not to associate with those we don&rsquo;t want to. As simple as that.</p>
<p>At a train station yesterday I observed the high school kids, lots of them. The Asians all stay together, likewise all the other ethnic groups form their own small groups. Out in our woodland gardens this morning did I notice the magpies with the cockatoo or the lorikeets with the honeyeaters, no way, they stay feed and breed each with their own kind.</p>
<p>I think it is called the natural order.</p>

<p>What hogwash!  There is ALWAYS a reason for exclusion, racism, and xenophobia. But of course they want to make it sound like &#8220;genocide&#8221; always follows if one doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;mix it up&#8221;!  </p>
<p>Sure am glad that it didn&rsquo;t work!  What will be next on the real haters, the SPLC&rsquo;s plate to FORCE people to like/date each other? </p>
<p> Tolerance to them means forcing WHITES only to accept their own genocide through miscegenation and invasion of foreign elements into their society. Hope our young White people wakes up to this fact very soon.</p>

		<p>Many years ago, I attended a family reunion picnic. All present were descendents (and their spouses) of a deceased  man and wife. Five generations were present. All were middle income Wasps or reasonable approximations. The affair lasted all afternoon and evening, in most cases people associated with those relatives that they knew. In spite of the efforts of the oragnizers, there was litte interaction between relatives who did not know each other. </p>
<p>I have attended company dinners where the same phenomenon occurred. In spite of higher management&rsquo;s best efforts, people associated with the people that they worked with. </p>
<p>I think the liberals who implemented the &#8220;Mix It Up at Lunch Day&#8221; know this, and were not suprised at the outcome. It did, however, give liberal control freaks the opportunity to herd the students around.</p>
<p><i>The Holocaust: Facing History and Ourselves</i>: Seems like wall to wall liberal propaganda, emphasizing the evils of white men.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t seem very tolerant. Perhaps these &#8216;educators&rsquo; have entirely the wrong target in mind for their &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; campaign? They seem to have a less accurate understanding of the situation than &#8216;Laserman&rsquo; has with his gunsight. </p>

		<p>I suppose we should expect more of this, and longer lasting attempts, like &#8220;Mix it up Week,&#8221; to force white children into closer and closer association with minorities.  It&rsquo;s clear that the 24/7 indoctrination that white kids receive - from schools, the entertainment media, and just about every other venue in society - that whites are (in Susan Sontag&rsquo;s words) &#8220;the cancer of history,&#8221; responsible for every evil in the world, has failed to obliterate their natural human desire to be among people like themselves.  So the next step is to demonstrate that this desire itself - for whites - is the greatest evil of all, and simply must be eradicated, by whatever means necessary and whatever the cost.</p>
<p>Look for a big expansion in these programs over the next few years.         </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Holocaust&#8221; and always &#8220;The Holocaust&#8221;.  As if no other group of human beings ever had a hard time.  Nothing about the mass murder of Pol Pot.  Or the mass murder of Mao Tse Tung.  Or the mass murder of Stalin, who all by himself created more civilian victims than Hitler did.  Oh wait, they were all Communists, and Communists are leftists, just like the no-enemies-on-the-left SPLC, so they get a pass.</p>
<p>As for practicing tolerance, the SPLC displays no tolerance whatsoever to people like us who wish no harm to come to blacks, Asians, or whomever but simply want to be left alone by our government and &#8220;do gooder&#8221; leftist busy bodies, and not be told whom we have to hire, or whom we have to sell our houses to, or whom we must go to school with.<br>

		<p>There was an OUTSTANDING comment on this topic from a lunch room teacher last time around. She told how MIx-It-Up day was nothing more than White kids under verbal pressure and visual surveillence from the administrators needing to &#8220;walk over&#8221; and ask to sit at a Black or Hispanic table. The minority kids would smirk with a taste of their momentary power over their peers, who needed their permission to complete this &#8220;assignment&#8221; before getting the hell back to their side of the lunchroom.<br>
Then the &#8220;blank stares, tight smiles and hurried eating; descriptor pretty much takes it from there&hellip;</p>

<p>The most ironic (read: &ldquo;hypocritical&rdquo;) thing about the Southern Poverty Law Center is that NOT ONE of its top ten, highest paid executives is a minority.</p>
<p><a href="http://wp.me/pCLYZ-67" rel="nofollow">http://wp.me/pCLYZ-67</a></p>
<p>In fact, according to the SPLC&rsquo;s hometown newspaper, the Montgomery Advertiser, despite being located LITERALLY in the back yard of Dr. Martin Luther King&rsquo;s home church, the SPLC has NEVER hired a person of color to a highly paid position of power. <br>

		<p>Poster #2 is correct.  I have seen this in two different public schools.  The Facing History curriculum is one big anti-white tirade, and all whites are painted as evil, whether Axis or Allies.  It is sickening in its childish conclusions.</p>
<p>There is another curriculum, the African slavery one.  Again, even though 95% of all kidnapped Africans were brought to LATIN AMERICAN or Brazil (did you know this), the whole slavery issue is pinned on white Americans exclusively.</p>
<p>Even though only 5% of southerners owned the slaves, the other 95% are all lumped in as evil &#8216;massas&rsquo; who raped and killed like fiends daily.  Even though the north won the civil war and slavery ended, northerners (save for the liberals) are all tarred as racists and evilmongers also.</p>
<p>I sat in on one such class where the students were reading some very graphic book about the evil effects of slavery.  The older black lady teacher was thundering her condemnations of whitey in every way imaginable.  I began to feel extremely uncomfortable, being the only white person in the room.  (All the students were black/latino).</p>
<p>The anti-white indoctrination was off the charts.  I kept thinking I would confront this teacher afterwards, nicely, and try to get her to consider that not all white people are evil, but I knew it would fall on deaf ears, and she might try to get the affirmative action black principal to fire me.  (He was already trying to get all the older white, asian and ironically latino teachers fired.)</p>
<p>It was then that I realized there is no hope for our future and we get drowned in a tide &#8216;of color.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The ideas of the radical left fly in the face of the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of ten thousand years.  Yet they soldier on, determined to force their objectives onto society.  And they don&rsquo;t care whether we learn to like it or not.  If the SPLC could have made this forced-association exercise a permanent rule, it would have.  The cultural lefties don&rsquo;t care one whit whether anything was learned from this experiment; they just took what they could get.  Pelosi didn&rsquo;t care whether the public would like Obamacare; she herded cats and pushed it through.  Her party lost the majority, but she&rsquo;s hanging on by her fingernails, hoping to regain power in two years.  <br>
These people would assign marriage partners if they could.  And it might not even be someone of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>I assume he (guess it to be a he) is the school commissar?  Within pure reality, I cannot help but wonder what country an Ali Nemcovich actually belongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called Mix It Up at Lunch Day, and over 5,000 schools across the country participated yesterday. Sponsored by the Southern Poverty Law Center, it&rsquo;s meant to show students of all grade levels that they may have more in common with the people they don&rsquo;t talk to than they think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, it is called anti-European American/European day.   <br>

		<p>&#8220;The Holocaust:Facing History and Ourselves&#8221;</p>
<p> I grew up in a public school that had a large feeder population from the near by military bases. One friend had a Dad who had been nominated for the Medal of Honor on D-day. Another peer had a Dad who had lost a leg, an arm and an eye on Iwo Jima. The younger kids had Dads who were away in Vietnam.</p>
<p>  So, sometimes I think that this is why The Holocaust lesson plans didn`t catch on till a generation after. You can`t bully kids whose fathers were there or paid the price for shutting down the Nazis. The newer generation of kids can`t resist this type of indoctrination because they can`t tell their teachers, &#8220;My Dad was there and yours wasn`t!! So don`t tell me who to feel sorry for or proud of!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I went ahead to the Teaching Tolerance web site to find out their spin on the day. One thing that amused me was how the kids were assigned tables by the color of Lifesaver they were given. A little sugar to make the lesson go down perhaps? Another was how a teacher was assigned to each table to make things went well. And I thought, &#8220;You mean like Gestapo agents being assigned to Pioneer Battalions at Stalingrad to ferret out Alarmists&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>One really has to be careful about those about them. Mixing it up is not a good idea at all, especially at meal-times. It could be a real disaster especially if a run of bad luck hits one of the primitive superstitious group who could simply accuse one of the others as being responsible for their predicament. It happens a lot, even in these enlightened post-slavery times.<br>

Facing &#8220;ourselves&#8221;?  What do WE have to face?  What does the Holocaust have to do with US? That was another event in another time in another country  on another continent. Rather than blaming us, they should be thanking us for ending it  (and slavery too, for that matter).  Why are our white youth always being force-fed this endless diet of GUILT? </p>
<p>Bad enough guilt for slavery, but now the Holocaust too!   (And, btw,  what did people in New Hampshire have to do with either one?)</p>

You can bet dollars to doughnuts that the lunch tables were carefully scutinized as to racial makeup and adjusted accordingly to the faculty`s liking. It`s NOT like they put 1200 kids names in a bag and pulled them out one by one&hellip;</p>

<p>It probably is hard to bridge the difference, especially when these very same people spend their time with non-whites telling them they don&rsquo;t need to know whites. They are special as they are. And need to give more, not to strange whites but to themselves. They need to give-back. It&rsquo;s not the &#8216;racists&rsquo; dividing and delineating by race. It&rsquo;s the leftist establishment. They seem to want it both ways.  <br>

<p>&#8220;This is important: &ldquo;The Holocaust: Facing History and Ourselves,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our enemies use the Holocaust to force White Children to believe that they are all little Nazis, and the only cure is continual immersion in stories about the horrors of Auschwitz. &ldquo;You would probably do to the oppressed and marginalized African Americans, all of whom would be &lsquo;distinguished, esteemed, and renowned&rsquo; without your discriminating against them, what the Nazis did to the Jews, if you had a chance and if you don&rsquo;t continually search yourself for unacknowledged biases, prejudices, and latent racism. We are the ones who can help you, and our help is mandatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no such thing as forgiveness in Elite Liberalism. All is the Jewish system of atonement- and Whites are the ones who must do the atoning for all of history&rsquo;s misery.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would think that Jewish groups would not appreciate the actual history of The Holocuast being used to further such broad and obvious political mangling.  Where Attonememnt is concerned, I think the Jewish way is to attone for a day and then, as in Catholic confession, go on your merry way, hopefully reminded of things like The Ten Commandments, that both share as common law of God.  For Christians, beyond confession, there is all the acts of faith, as in reacting to all threats, insults, attacks (even physical ones) with love.  That is what is ludicris to me.  The only reason any of this works is because most Whites carry Christian indoctrination in their brains from Childhood, with these sorts of contradictions to their own survival programmed in.</p>
<p>Throw the entire system out, like a bucket of dirty water.  The nobel, honorable white conscious is enough, and ought to be joined to a love of one&rsquo;s family and bloodline.  The rest is a maze of useless, burdensome, obstacles.</p>

		<p>Browser (#26):  &#8220;What did the people of New Hampshire have to do with Slavery and The Holocaust?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, actually, they had a LOT to do with both.  They sent their sons and husbands off to be slaughtered during the America&rsquo;s Civil War, supposedly to END Slavery.</p>
<p>Then, they sent their sons and husbands off to Europe, to fight the Nazis (in addition to planting Victory Gardens, knitting socks, buying War Bonds, saving tinfoil, enduring rationing, contributing to all manner of relief efforts&hellip;and paying (ugly word)loads of taxes for decades, to finance the war effort).</p>
<p>And what is their reward for contributing their lives and limbs and livelihoods to help save the Jews and free the Slaves?  Their big &#8216;Thank You&rsquo; is having their descendants vilified and made to feel sorry for the very things they fought so valiantly to stop.</p>
<p>If you ask me, the people of New Hampshire would have fared far better if the South had been allowed to secede.  And considering what&rsquo;s happening today, it is doubtful that the people of New Hampshire would be much worse off had Americans not fought with the &#8216;Allies&rsquo;.  Considering that White Genocide is now a very real possibility, how could they have been subject to worse dangers under the Nazis?</p>
<p>The elderly English are watching their country being taken away from Englishmen and wondering why they bothered to fight Germany.  I can imagine that the surviving members of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Greatest Generation may be beginning to have the same thoughts.</p>

		<p>The Nazi solution to the &#8220;Jewish Question&#8221; AKA the Holocaust was an abominable atrocity. The Allies ended it and no, it&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t our problem because we took the initiative to put an end to it but nevertheless we must not forget it. </p>
<p>This Anti-Jewish preoccupation on the part of some of the posters on this site has got to stop. It serves only to divert attention from the real problem in this country e.g. the atricious physical assaults on White people occuring every day in this totally f  &mdash;  -ed up society and many of the victims of those assaults are Jewish Americans with Eve Carson and Lauren Burk being the most notable lately. I could name ad infintum the names and cases of Jews who have been beaten, raped and murdered by Africans either because they were White or because they were Jews or both. Black thugs are the new SA and SS without the fancy uniforms and the organization and they will ultimately be more dangerous to our survival.<br>
There are several Jews who post here and who share our views and there are many others of like mind although they are loathe to admit it due to generations of education in the liberal philosophy. Let&rsquo;s stop this nonsense and try to work together for the survival of our European- American race, heritage and culture in which Euro/American Jews played a large part in creating.</p>

<p>You expressed wonderfully in your beautifully-written post how so many of us here feel, especially the oldest WW II generation, the one that sacrificed their very lives and that of their loved ones to a war in which we had no business.</p>
<p>My midwestern grandmother cried herself to death after her oldest son was shot down over Europe in a transport plane he was piloting.  She had to fight to retrieve his body because the locals buried him in their cemetery, with honors, after his body washed up on a beach.<br>
  <br>
Wonder how she&rsquo;d feel now, after sacrificing her son to the Nazi/Allied War Machine, about her descendants being called &#8216;Nazis!&rsquo; by the SPLC et al.  About an overt War being conducted against Whites by those who wish our genocide. </p>

I&rsquo;ll agree to face the Holocaust, especially our Southern Holocaust of Reconstruction I and II.  We are victims, and the time has come to demand our justice.</p>
<p>We need a Reconstruction Memorial for all the Whites who suffered from the blacks&rsquo; Loyal Leagues.</p>
<p>Until White Southerners get our restorative justice, we just can&rsquo;t afford to worry about what bothers the Jews, blacks, Muslims, Mexicans, etc.</p>
<p>Let them all solve their own problems without asking anything from us, and if they do ask something from us, then start negotiating: what are you offering to help us through the pain of our own victimhood?</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t admit our suffering, then we have no basis for discussion.</p>

<p>I am tired of my race being blamed for every evil that was created by non-whites and being denigrated in spite of all the beauty, culture, scientific advancements, and in general the total improvement of the HUMAN condition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that most history is written by the victors.  Any truth about atrocities on the &#8220;victor&rsquo;s side seems to be &#8220;hushed up&#8221; or, if known, not spoken about in polite company.</p>
<p>How many people know that Switzerland, being neutral during WW II was a conduit to get strategic materials from the Axis to the Allies (and vice-versa).  There is a lot of &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; history that can be explored by some judicious digging.  It might not be easy to find or pretty, but it but the TRUTH is out there.  Always seek the TRUTH.<br>
