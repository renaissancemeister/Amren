<h1>Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s High Dropout Rate Studied</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Haughey, San Francisco Examiner, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only three black boys graduated from Thurgood Marshall Academic High School last year.</p>
<p>That staggering statistic led students Donel Finks, Angelica Escobar, Edgar Ulu, Fernando Torrez and Frank Nelson to explore the underlying factors that cause so many of their peers to drop out. </p>
<p>Their five-minute-long documentary  &mdash;  &#8220;Why So Low?&#8221;  &mdash;  was the winner of the high school division at this year&rsquo;s My Hero International Film Festival, which celebrated its sixth anniversary Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The group of five Thurgood Marshall students examined why the second-largest racial group at their school had the lowest graduation rates in &#8220;Why So Low?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They found that the dropout rate is largely due to a lack of resources rather than a lack of skills. Thirty percent of families in the area earn less than $10,000 a year, and local kids make up 27 percent of the youths in the juvenile system.</p>

<p>So collecting section 8 and food stamps and welfare now qualifies as &#8220;earning&#8221;? and I doubt any of these folks would take a job for $5 (and less) bucks an hour.</p>
<p>As for lacking resources? Another myth, black males are given everything they need by groups and organizations whose sole mission is to see that black males succeed.</p>
<p>What the film should have focused on was how many of the dropouts had multiple pairs of air jordans, $200 droopy jeans with fancy stitching and all the other accessories needed for today&rsquo;s urban yoots, then they should have surveyed the families to see how many had Escalades and Lexuses parked in the driveway. That would have been the real revelation<br>

<p>Funny, we spend more money per child then their entire family earns! And of course, by &#8220;earns&#8221; we mean &#8220;received in handouts&#8221;</p>
<p>The only sad part is whites who are forced to suffer by being in contact with these unwanted parasites. You can bet they only exist in the area and go to that school because of forced integration and subsidized housing.</p>

		<p>another case of mistaken cause and effect. Families &#8220;earning&#8221; less than $10k/yr. is not the cause of high black drop out rates, &#8220;earning&#8221; less than $10k/yr is the effect of dropping out of high school.<br>
What these novice film makers saw was the previous generation of families who had also dropped out of high school. </p>

		<p>Can someone help me? There was an HBO Special that came out about five years ago that was soo explosive it might have just gone down the memory hole. I believe it was called &#8220;A Year in the Life of (Fill in blank) High School&#8221; It highlighted the impossibility of teaching at this Black High School.<br>
 I tuned in right when they were filming an obviously Gay and previously idealistic Theatre/ Language Arts teacher.  The guy had dissolved into tears of anger, frustration, resentment  and rage at his own students. He asked, &#8220;Do you know what its like to work all night for nine hours  on the next days assignment, hoping to bring some culture and enlightenment into the lives of young people, only to have the whole lesson plan dissolve into laughter, name calling and fistfights in less than five minutes?!?&#8221;  Ouch! Wham Bingo!! This guy had the 1000 Yard stare from 15 and 16 year old boys&hellip;You knew he was destroyed by teaching the unteachable.<br>
  The end of the show was even more damning. It had teachers explaining to their classes before the end of year assesment test how important it was. For the students, the teachers and the school. How jobs, individuals, techniques and other ponderables were being evaluted by the results. Didn`t matter a lick. As soon as the bell rang to begin 85% percent of the class just stacked their books and went to sleep for two hours. The other ten percent talked and harrassed the last five percent. I sat there stunned that this footage had even made the light of day.  I used up all my boyfriend points asking my girl to let us stay in the hotel room hoping it would come on again. I remember being able to find snippets on You tube, then later nothing. Any body else see this? <br>

<p>That settles it. If high schoolers Miss Escobar, Fernando, Donel, etc, have deemed poor black performance a resources&#8221; problem, then it must be so. Why else would the San Francisco Examiner print this story??</p>
<p>Lets throw money at the problem and all will be well. Why didnt we here at AmRen think of this??<br>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s got to be because they weren&rsquo;t treated as if they were gifted students, as the brilliant black reporter claimed would guarantee success.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama wants to put salad bars in schools and encourage blacks to lose weight, pretending she wants those things for ALL of the country&rsquo;s students, stupidly thinking that I.Q. is influenced solely by outside factors and not genes.</p>
<p>These fools can try what they want, but blacks, especially black males, will forever be the world&rsquo;s dunces and be predisposed to crime, preferring crime over working.</p>

<p>This implies that it&rsquo;s not just blacks who are either destitute or juvenile delinquents.  Yet, those two things only seem to be credible excuses for black academic failure.  Why isn&rsquo;t poverty and juvenile crime blamed for the high Asian, white or Hispanic dropout rate?</p>
<p>And before we start thinking these &#8220;low income&#8221; households are so &#8220;poor,&#8221; have a look at this:</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that this &#8220;Lack of Resources&#8221; thing holds back the black race.  I am Caucasian and apparently my peers and I who also lacked resources were &#8220;fortunate&#8221; enough to not let that hold us back.</p>
<p>I got where I am today because I was lucky and I learned early that the harder I worked and studied the &#8220;luckier&#8221; I became.</p>
<p>Go to your local library and find out how many non-Asian minority kids are utilizing this free resource.</p>

		<p>Perhaps black males score lower on standardized tests because they aren&rsquo;t as smart as Whites.  Perhaps they commit more crimes because black males are more violent than white males.  Perhaps they rape women at a rate that is astronomically higher than white men, because they are sexual predators by nature. Perhaps they carry sexually transmitted disease at a rate 100 times higher than whites because they are dumb to connect actions to consequences.   </p>

		<p>Nothing really out of the ordinary here for a pretend place named Thurgood Marshall High School.  Its great to know that these dropouts don&rsquo;t lack smarts  &mdash;  only resources.  Gee, who&rsquo;d ever stumbled onto this cold, hard truth without a brilliant writer like Sarah Houghey of the San Franscisco Examiner (how appropriate, another left-wing bird cage liner) leading us to the obvious conclusion.  Seeing as how a &#8220;lack of resources&#8221; is the problem here, let&rsquo;s initiate a great new Marshall Plan (Thurgood Marshall, that is) to distribute billions to these lovely people of color who suffer from &#8220;a lack of resources.&#8221; I guarantee you will see young, brilliant, eager black scholars by the score suddenly appear on every ghetto street corner. </p>

No, I don&rsquo;t remember this program, but it sounds fascinating.<br>
If you want a real-life slice of the documentary that disappered, you have an open invitation to my room at an alternative school. It wouldn&rsquo;t be an eye-opener for us, but it might be for a large swath of America. If we could only take the $ spent at my school and put it towards Gifted and Talented programs&hellip; *sigh*</p>

		<p>Basically, you don&rsquo;t need to read beyond the words &#8220;Thurgood Marshall Academic High School&#8221; to know what&rsquo;s coming. In any event, the article is deeply flawed because it is written in a way that presents the &#8220;findings&#8221; as the final word and the definitive answer.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t read the piece closely you&rsquo;d think the study was done by top-level researchers steeped in statistics.</p>
<p>No - the &#8220;findings&#8221; are based on a 5 minute documentary made by students at the school as part of some empowerment-oriented film festival. Besides having no credentials or proper data, a closer look at the names of the students may indicate some possible bias. The filmmakers: Donel Finks, Angelica Escobar, Edgar Ulu, Fernando Torrez and Frank Nelson.</p>
<p>I see they are starting early here at Thurgood Marshall in making excuses for black failure. (And please, as a reminder, never send your children to a school named for African American &#8220;leaders&#8221; like Thurgood or Harriet or those who appear on postage stamps every February). </p>
<p>And how good could this little 5 minute movie be? Here&rsquo;s your answer: As would be expected in a competition at a San Francisco school of color, &#8220;72 films were awarded and 39 individuals or organizations received special Hero awards for effecting positive change either in their local community or the global community.&#8221; </p>
<p>Basically, everyone won something. You can&rsquo;t have hurt feelings - it might lower black self-esteem.</p>
<p>What is most frustrating - what bothers me the most and continues to do so - is that the answer to the problem is clear as day. Blacks have low IQs, minimal reasoning skills, and poor impulse control. That&rsquo;s why they can&rsquo;t get through high school much less function in western society.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s genetic. It&rsquo;s not my fault. But first you have to acknowledge the truth before you can deal with the problem. </p>
<p>The only answer is segregation of the school system and a form of urban martial law in high-crime black enclaves.</p>
<p>Unless implemented in the next decade we are certainly doomed as a nation.<br>

- Sarah Haughey, San Francisco Examiner, November 22, 2010<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Sarah Haughey took the time to find what families in the area were earning, and what percent of youths were in the juvenile system.  Nevertheless, she did not define what she meant by &#8220;skills,&#8221; and she did not document that blacks were as proficient in these skills as other racial groups.  <br>

		<p>Advocates of school reform sometimes tell us we should raise standards and reduce the dropout rate. Raising standards and reducing the dropout rate is like cutting taxes and balancing the budget.  It cannot be done.  When standards are raised many students discover that they lack the ability to keep up.  Therefore they drop out.  <br>
 <br>
The way to reduce the drop out rate is to dumb down standards until they are meaningless.  </p>

		<p>I taught for 45 years with my last 22 teaching in a public school. I learned that with Blacks all but a few exceptions  (those in my honors classes)  are a lost cause. Their raison d&rsquo;etre is disruption, wandering the corridors and searching out opportunities to copulate. All their wounds are self inflicted and I sense that even the liberal (whatever that means) are beginning to notice it and some of them are expressing their own frustration. </p>

		<p>Reading this piece one would gain the inference (as is clearly intended) that black students drop out in order to support their families.  I suppose that&rsquo;s plausible enough if one assumes that the drop-outs intend to support their unwed mothers and siblings through a career of mugging, burglary, and petty theft.</p>
<p>Given the enemployment rate among black youths, it would appear that they&rsquo;re not joining the workforce.</p>

		<p>I have experience teaching in urban, 100% non-white high schools.  Poster #1 hit the nail on the head.  The &#8216;minority&rsquo; students (actually complete majority) are in the grip of a very nihilistic, materialistic culture of bravado and macho behavior.  </p>

<p>They just don&rsquo;t want to do anything related to school because their culture says it&rsquo;s &#8216;whack.&rsquo;  They come to school for the socialization, the networking, the women and the drug sales.  And some come for the free food and other goodies.  A few have a vague sense that they should be learning something, but they are often swamped by the out-of-control classrooms that Arne Duncan would flunk out of and be fired from as an incompetent teacher.</p>
<p>The answer is complicated and not simple, but it would invariably be accompanied by cries of &#8216;racism.&rsquo;  Alas, we saw the end of our civilization and went through the motions, but to little avail.</p>

		<p>The last three years I (served) and served is the right word because it was almost like an out of control prison involved a school with a black to white ratio of 6 to 1.<br>
It was an eye opening experience since I would have said I have No Racist Tendencies, but these black students woke me up to the fact of how dangerous these people are. Liars, cheaters, sexual perverts and predators in every sense of the word. But as long as America wants to make these people the victim rather than the one victimizing, this will continue to be the norm.</p>

<p>That is a synopsis of the HBO documentary about Thurgood Marshall HS in Baltimore.  Notice it lauds the school for its jazz band, basketball and debate programs.  The first two you can take for granted in a black school, but as far as the latter, notice it says it &#8220;wins trophies&#8221; in the &#8220;Baltimore Urban Debate League.&#8221;  I guess this is a &#8220;league&#8221; that gives you a trophy just for participating.  Even if this isn&rsquo;t the case, we&rsquo;re talking an &#8220;urban&#8221; (read: black) league.  How hard can it be to win the competition?  Even if the competition included whites or Asians, I get the feeling that the white liberal pandering debate judges would still let Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s team win the competition, because debating isn&rsquo;t an exact science, it is very much subject to qualitative interpretation, except if the judges are world renowned masters in Aristotelian logic and judge purely based on it.  </p>

<p>Sorry, I misspoke.  My question should have been this:  Why do those world-renowned sociologists, Messrs. Finks, Ulu, Torrez, Nelson and Miss Escobar allow only black dropouts from Thurgood Marshall HS to use the crutch of &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;juvenile crime?&#8221;  Why don&rsquo;t they cite poverty and juvenile crime as a reason for the school&rsquo;s Hispanic dropouts (Hispanics might actually have a higher dropout rate than blacks at this school), or for the very few white and Asian dropouts?</p>

		<p>Many years ago when I lived in NYC I knew a young woman in the neighborhood who worked at night for one of the airlines taking reservations and went to school part-time during the day to become a teacher. </p>
<p>She finally finished and got her teaching degree and lasted one year. I think she was teaching &#8220;special needs&#8221; or something. She said there were these black teens in the class who were twice her size who would call her a honky,a f***ing white b**ch, etc., etc.. She said a colleague of hers, a petite woman, would cry everyday before class started. The colleague didn&rsquo;t even last the whole year. </p>
<p>This young woman I knew gave up after her first year and went back to the airlines job. </p>

		<p>If we can get blacks to stop calling a house a crib and get them to stop calling money, chips, then maybe we can get them to 5th grade reading level. Blacks refer to quantities in terms of nickels, dimes, and ounces. Maybe the left should allow a drug dealer to teach math. A crackhead will teach about balancing the budget. Thug drive by shooters will teach about the importance of the environment.  Prisoners will serve as supreme court justices. Last but not least we will have laws passed by illegal aliens. </p>

		<p>Tim- that HBO program is called &#8220;Hard Times At Douglass High&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s most edifying-  recommend it, particularly to those that have never really experienced what is being discussed in these articles.<br>
Unfortunately, I have.  In fact, I went to the school discussed in this article.  I was there when they began bussing in the ghetto kids and changed the school&rsquo;s name to Thurgood Marshall.  It wasn&rsquo;t a bad school before that, but within a year, it became hell.  I was assaulted badly enough to be taken to the hospital twice in one semester at that school.</p>
<p>My parents were liberals.  They said I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough to get along with the new diverse students.  I was a very petite girl- not some strapping teen boy.  I went from straight A honor student to dropout.  I refused to go back there, the school system refused to transfer me.  I had planned to become a radiologist.  Oh, well.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Such interesting comments from so many posters - especially from the teachers!  It reveals a festering subterranean world  that many of us would be unaware of.   But that world is starting to boil over, and we can&rsquo;t ignore it.  When and where I went to HS, disrupting the class, cursing at the teacher,  drugs, metal detectors, guards in the halls, were simply unheard of.  We took that for granted back then. It was normal, but now in hindsight  it seems like utopia.</p>
<p>I think a great deal of the  &#8220;minority&#8221; racial problem  here (particularly with blacks, but not only them) comes from assigning them automatic &#8220;victim&#8221; status and giving endless sympathy and indulgence. And especially giving welfare and all sorts of other free benefits that they now take for granted as their rightful due and don&rsquo;t have to work for.  They thus have a sense that &#8220;society owes me&#8221;. </p>
<p>Welfare, affluence, crime, and generally easy money make all of this possible for them. It is the price we pay for our prosperity. While we complain about the economic crunch, unemployment, and hard times, the truth is we have a long, long way to go before we know poverty and desperation the way the Third World knows them.  </p>
<p>Many years ago, I spent a visit at the University of Fez, in Morocco, as a guest. I was not a student, but it was quite a learning experience  anyway and I learned a lot that was not in any curriculum.  In a poor country like Morocco,  with grinding poverty beyond the imagination of even the poorest American,  with very few opportunities, and where NOTHING is given away free and everything has to be worked for, life is a struggle. Learning is greatly respected and achievement is rewarded.  The only way upward out of poverty is through hard work, study, and accomplishment.  Teachers there are respected, not sneered at.  And learning is revered.  A scholar is an admired person, not a dork or a geek who is snickered at.  Nor is there any option of turning to crime as the easy way out (as it is here), since crime is dealt with very, very harshly and there is no hand-wringing for criminals.   They are simply dispatched without ado. There is no glorification of &#8220;gangstas&#8221; and the criminal lifestyle. </p>
<p>People there who do not learn or do not produce simply do not survive.  They can become beggars or they can starve.   There is no welfare and their families cannot  support them when they can barely feed themselves.  That is the harshness of life as it has always  been down through the ages.  We have tried to modify that in more humane ways.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s face it: learning involves hard work. And for most who are not intellectually gifted, it is difficult and boring.  In affluent America,  it is much easier to chase the girls and play basketball and be an irresponsible playboy.   But in poor countries, you cannot do that or you will have no future.  And you will have nothing to eat for supper tonight either.  Life is harsh.   Regrettably, most people have to be forced to work, and to learn.  A few gifted people will study and learn for the joy of it, but not the rest.   Welfare, in the western world, makes such an effort unnecessary. It gives them a life free of want and insecurity (if not quite  luxury) without having to strive for it. So why should they bother?  They can always supplement it with &#8220;outside income&#8221; from illicit activities - all of which will be viewed tolerantly by a permissive and indulgent  society.</p>
<p>As Jay stresses above, this is largely a CULTURAL problem, as much as economic.  Music, rap, videos, movies  - even millionaire sports &#8220;heroes&#8221;   &mdash;   glorify the no-work, easy life,  gangsta lifestyle. There is no condemnation, and no suffering, for  dropping out and taking the easy way. Indeed, it is glamorous, so why should anybody take a job making beds or washing dishes?  And who&rsquo;s going to pick lettuce or fruit out in a muddy field, when they can stay at home and watch TV?  You don&rsquo;t need a high school diploma to get on welfare&hellip; just make a baby  and you&rsquo;re set.</p>
<p>What is the alternative?  Those who don&rsquo;t try or can&rsquo;t make it, will be begging in the streets or searching the  garbage for scraps.  If they can&rsquo;t survive by begging, they&rsquo;ll starve.  Their illegitimate children will be homeless living in the streets and begging or stealing for a living.  You see the same in countries like Colombia and Brazil.   Is that what we want?  So what is to be done with them?   &mdash;   with those who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t learn or work?</p>
<p>Perhaps a third way would be to &#8220;license&#8221; parents, or some such strategy (though I dislike that idea).  Those who can&rsquo;t make it or fit in should not have to rely on lifetime welfare nor turn to begging or crime. They simply should not be born. That would eliminate the problem of the stupid, the criminal,  the anti-social, and the incompetent.  But it would also put awesome power in the hands of the government. Who would decide who is &#8220;fit&#8221;?  That could be a much greater problem. Do we want Maxine Waters, Tim Wise, and Eric Holder deciding who is fit  to be parents?</p>
<p>It does present a terrible dilemma and as Jay said,  the answer is complicated, not simple. And it&rsquo;s cultural. Basically, they don&rsquo;t take life seriously because they don&rsquo;t HAVE to.   I think at the least a reduction in the many entitlement programs, and a tightening of the justice system would put pressure on the lazy and the underachievers to make more effort.   And their parents must be held more responsible for their kids.  Nor must we continue encouraging the fantasy that everyone can be anything he/she wants to be.  And we must drop the absurd notion that everyone should go to college. That only debases the value of a college education.  When everyone goes to college, a college degree is meaningless.  And we must give more weight and respect to the useful jobs and trades   &mdash;   those &#8220;jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want to do&#8221;,  (so aliens are imported to do them while Americans do nothing).    We don&rsquo;t need more grumpy sociologists with PhDs.   We need more agriculture workers, so we won&rsquo;t have to import them.  There are plenty of idle Americans  who would take those unglamorous jobs if they HAD to, if welfare is cut and they were disabused of the notion that they could be rap stars, millionaire pimps, drug kings, and sports &#8220;celebrities&#8221;.   That means our cultural values  will  have to change drastically  and become more practical, more realistic before anything else can change. It means changing the whole culture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not have the feeling that he realizes the difficulties of his job and is burning the midnight oil in an effort to conquer them; rather he seems convinced that the problems are pretty easy and that he is fairly well equipped to grapple with them – or rather to follow someone else&rsquo;s grapple. All this makes life fairly easy for him, save when he is confronted with a difference of opinion, and then he tosses a coin.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;30% earn less than $10k per year&#8221; .  This is probably true, suprised its that much. Key word here is earn. They are not figuring in unearned income, ie welfare, free house ect. I am in real estate, and about 10 or so years ago I handled a rental house for a big fat black welfare mom and did the paperwork. I was amazed at how much money she made. She got free house rent paid, the part I handled, but on top of that she got food stamps, free lights/water, the tax refund credit, direct cash payments, all medical paid,,, and more I cant think of at this time, and of course all tax free. All together more than my professional income with no tax figured in. Yet with all this she was completely worthless with an awful attitude and ran a &#8220;shot house&#8221; out of our house we rented. So, why would they have 10k of earned income at all when the unearned income is more than many of us make working full time and supporting them by paying our taxes&hellip;.  The black male problem will never go away until we can tell the truth of how it really is, and that will never happen in our politically correct society. KF  </p>

<p>&#8220;Marshall Thurgood Academic High School is anything but academic&hellip;.And the safety of the students is always in question.&#8221; </p>
<p>comment from .insiderpages</p>
<p>Well, which is it?  Think I&rsquo;ll go with insiderpages.com</p>
<p>And, after realizing that TM&#8221;A&#8221;HS is in San Francisco (and not NY, as I first thought) how did I know this school is located near the notorious, toxic dump  known as Hunter&rsquo;s Point?</p>
<p><i>The neighborhood is roughly 60% African-American, the highest concentration of that ethnic group in San Francisco&hellip; the area is plagued with moderate crime, gang and drug activity, as well as a moderate murder rate</i></p>
<p>Wonder what &#8216;moderate&rsquo; means.</p>
<p>I remember PeeJay posting once that San Francisco is (mostly) safe and nice because blacks were pushed out of the primo areas, out into Hunter&rsquo;s Point, otherwise tourists like me wouldn&rsquo;t be able to walk all over the city,  just about anywhere.</p>
<p>You can be sure this pushing out was done before the entire city went bat guano.  </p>
<p>But which is worse, black Section 8 housing areas scattered all over the city or a city run by neo-Soviets?  Maybe those Neo Soviet Bosses on the City Council DO know a thing or two about black behavior.</p>

<p>The continued bad performance of black students is becoming harder and harder to ignore.  While this has opened some interesting tactical cracks in the wall of political correctness it&rsquo;s not likely to open a breach.  It won&rsquo;t cause the elite to question whether replacing a spectacularly successful people and culture with less successful peoples and cultures is a good idea.  It can be amusing, though.

		<p>For those who are interested check out the following links.  Lincoln Elementary School is in the heart of Oakland Chinatown.  Most students have no parents at home after school = turn key kids.  Mostly immigrant community with no English spoken at home = no academic help from parents.  This school is mostly ignored by the media because it would STOP the racist shakedown imposed by some WHITES in this country.  The blacks cannot do a thing if a no is firmly given by whites to their demands.  The ones holding others in bondage over black/Hispanic deficiencies knows exactly what they are doing.  They know IQ and racial differences have a big influence over ability to function in society.   www.ibabuzz.com/education/2010/09/09/oakland-school-wins&hellip;    And school-ratings.com/school details/01612596002018.html -</p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
Actually, in the Marxist hierarchy of values class trumps everything else. <br>
 <br>
In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx wrote, &#8220;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&hellip;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;The working men have no country&hellip;National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing,&#8221; <br>
 <br>
Marx did not understand the importance of national loyalty, and seemed hardly aware of race at all. However, he would have recognized the underclass as what he called &#8220;the dangerous class, [lumpenproletariat] the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Because white blue collar workers in the United States seldom have behaved the way Marx said they should, his contemporary followers have tried to find a group of people who did.  They have not been very successful. Marx would have had little regard for those who supplement their welfare checks with the gains from criminal activities, committed primarily against working class people.  </p>

<p>Here is a video of a pep rally. Looks closer to 100% to me.</p>

		<p> As long as the blacks realise that they will always hold the upper hand by being constantly portrayed as the &#8220;victim class&#8221;, be pushed forward by affirmative action and be able to scream racism at any one that has the audacity to hold them to any kind of real standards they will continue with this kind of behavior.<br>
 If the economy fails and America can no longer to do this; there will be riots, widespread unrest and general mayhem. <br>
 I have read that black leaders expect affirmative action to continue unabated forever. They keep reaching further and further back in time to make their victimhood status stay further into the future.<br>
 The &#8220;white guilt complex&#8221; must be ended, somehow, someway; it must be stopped.</p>

		<p>Bon- you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head. San Francisco is mostly safe because it is segregated; most of the blacks live in a few high-crime areas and they mostly stay there. Plus SF is only about 7% black.</p>
<p>SF reduced it&rsquo;s criminal population years ago by &#8220;redeveloping&#8221; the Fillmore (tearing down run-down houses in the black neighborhood and building expensive condos and flats in their place). They also periodically tear down high-rise housing projects and replace them with much improved townhouses- for the benefit of the blacks, of course (ha ha).</p>
<p>Looking at the stats on Thurgood Marshall, it seems there is a sizable Chinese presence. Between 9th grade and 12th, their proportion goes from 26% to 59%. If those poor kids are stuck going to a school in that neighborhood, I think we can assume they are low income, probably recent immigrants. The overall graduation rate is 85%. Funny how &#8220;poor resources&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t affect them.</p>
