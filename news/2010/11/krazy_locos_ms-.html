<h1>Krazy Locos, MS-13: Feds Crack Down on South Florida&rsquo;s Violent International Gangs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alexia Campbell, Palm Beach Post, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE and local police are targeting international gang members from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, using a wider array of charges that can be brought with deportation as a law enforcement tool. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Latin American gangs, or &#8220;maras,&#8221; spread to the United States in the 1980s as civil unrest broke out in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Members recruited in California prisons and formed well known groups such as MS-13 and Sur-13, Mangione said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gang members often recruit poor immigrants with the promise of money, new clothes and flashy cars, he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a growing problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have an emerging immigrant population, so there&rsquo;s more of a community to prey on.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The bust of Krazy Locos, of the Boynton Beach and Lake Worth area, shows how local and foreign gang alliances play out in the streets of Palm Beach County. </p>
<p>A group of Lake Worth-area youths formed Krazy Locos in 2001, and later teamed up with Sur-13, according to court records. Krazy Locos sought the protection of Sur-13 in Florida prisons and in the Palm Beach County neighborhoods they controlled. </p>
<p>Over the years, the Krazy Locos have been accused of sparking violence throughout the county with drive-by shootings, murders, drug trafficking and racketeering, according to court records. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Law enforcement officers also count victories in thwarting gangs from gaining traction in the region. Immigration agents have helped keep the MS-13 from gaining strength in Broward, according to Sgt. Dan Fitzpatrick of the Broward Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Gang Investigations Unit. </p>
<p>ICE can arrest and deport undocumented immigrants identified as gang members within days, even if they can&rsquo;t build a criminal case, Fitzpatrick said. </p>
<p>&#8220;When we don&rsquo;t know what we can charge them with, ICE brings them in and we can get them out of here,&#8221; Fitzpatrick said. </p>
<p>Immigration agents can arrest people without criminal charges if they are identified as illegal immigrants, according to ICE. If agents also identify them as gang members, an immigration judge can take that into consideration during the deportation hearings. </p>
<p>Investigators rely on informants, gang symbols, tattoos, graffiti and criminal associations to help identify gang members, among other criteria. </p>
<p>Deporting people without building criminal cases against them concerns immigration advocates, who question whether it&rsquo;s effective. Aileen Josephs, an immigration attorney and honorary consul of Guatemala to Palm Beach County, says the gang problem will continue if members don&rsquo;t serve prison time. </p>

		<p>Very interesting development. These supposed tough guys are exterminated on sight in their countries of origins.</p>
<p>Deportation, in this case equals an automatic death sentence.  Which is probably the intent.</p>
<p>Such a thing signals a dramatic shift in the way government and law enforcement views immigrants.</p>
<p>This is very common in the hypocrisy of the US system.  An unwillingness to punish the guilty so we outsource that function.  We say outwardly that tolerance to the point of foolishness is the only way to deal with the problem but create systems by which these people are simply exterminated by other states with less squeamishness.</p>

		<p>They are deported because the Democrats know that they are of no political value and are only a liability.  No drug gangs will be registering to vote and then following Dem. marching orders and complete the bloc vote.</p>
<p>Drug gangs will not join the Democracy, so send them home and say you are protecting the border.</p>
<p>A crass and cynical ploy.  </p>
<p>Republicans will not successfully tie the illegal alien criminal image with the illegal alien anchor baby making image.</p>
<p>Can you just feel it?  We are headed toward the biggest event in our lifetimes. Something horrible. Infamous.  The Pearl Harbor of race relations and national sovereignty.   </p>

<p>You are right.  My local paper (California) published reports from El Salvador and other points South as to what happens to these gang members once they are returned to their countries of origin  &mdash;  pulled off of buses and executed in full view of the bus, killed immediately at check points, hunted down and &#8216;macheteed&rsquo; by the local peasants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the gang tats that give them away.  Tats written across their foreheads, the front of their necks, down their arms (sleeves).  I understand the higher-ups in theses gangs, the masterminds, do not have these types of tats, no surprise there.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the irony:  These vicious gang members, many illegal, who are allowed to freely prey on innocent citizens in the United States, aided and abetted by LA&rsquo;s &#8216;Sanctuary City&rsquo; policies, are now fighting deportation orders in court by seeking  asylum   &mdash;    claiming that their lives are in danger in their home countries if deported!</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard or read that this tactic works, but stay tuned, because I have a feeling it will eventually, providing another way to block to deportation orders that involve heavily-tattooed, illegal colonist gang members.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
