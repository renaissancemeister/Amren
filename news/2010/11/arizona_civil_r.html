<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>November 3, 2010</p>
<p>PRINCETON, NJ (November 3, 2010)  &mdash;  Yesterday Arizonans approved a ballot initiative that prohibits racial preferences in the state&rsquo;s public institutions, including public colleges and universities. The Arizona Civil Rights Initiative (AzCRI), known as Proposition 107, passed with 60% of the vote.</p>
<p>The National Association of Scholars (NAS) counts the passage of Proposition 107 as a significant victory in the fight for merit-based higher education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again,&#8221; noted Stephen H. Balch, chairman of the NAS, &#8220;the American people have demonstrated they understand that basic fairness and good education require individuals to be treated as individuals rather than as the representatives of artificially defined identity groups. Higher education in Arizona will be strengthened through the restoration of this principle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NAS submitted an official argument in favor of Prop. 107 which all Arizona citizens received.</p>
<p>The argument called on voters to reaffirm the &#8220;basic ideal&#8221; that all men are created equal, pointing out that &#8220;It is as students that our young men and women come to full knowledge of America&rsquo;s heritage of rights and freedoms. By making higher education a color- and gender-coded experience, this comprehension is undermined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proposition 107 is the latest among similar initiatives which have already been approved in California, Washington, Michigan, and Nebraska.</p>
<p>The National Association of Scholars advocates for higher education reform. To learn more about NAS, visit www.nas.org.<br/>

		<p>It should be interesting to follow. . State government agencies, who seem to be made up 50% or more by non-whites, will their share of white workers increase? Or will the non-whites at these agencies, and their right-thinking white colleges, hire even more non-whites while not &#8216;officially&rsquo; discriminating? Whites are underreresented, for their share of the population, at many of these agencies, at least at 16 of 17 Federal Government agencies. This despite the fact that the non-white population has a much younger average age and many are not even eligible to work. It should be noted too, that older workers of all races earn more than do younger workers (We always must learn that non-whites earn less money than do whites).</p>

		<p>It is my understanding that AZCRI matched portions of state law passed by legislators some time go that prohibited this kind of affirmative action.  Still, I&rsquo;m happy for the win, because of the political message it sends.</p>

		<p>What they fail to point out anywhere in the entire article, is that private companies and corporation can continue to discriminate against whites uninterrupted and to their hearts content. In fact, they&rsquo;ll most likely increase their push for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; to &#8216;make up&rsquo; for this. Quite an admission or rather an omission.   </p>
<p>I guess the concerned paper isn&rsquo;t always concerned. At least not all the time. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t Arizona able to build a fence around itself?</p>
<p>I have read so many articles here on Amren, but I have never thought such a great step would these days be possible. </p>
<p>Please just make a big fence around you. I am sure in 20 years we would have refugees from California trying to get into Arizona. And of course the Media would be to stupid to understand why Arizona kept wealthy why the rest of Multicultural America decreased in power, wealth and safety.</p>

		<p>Just to make maybe a somewhat hasty comment, after reading this, the first thing that came to my mind was: yeah, why should monies (grants, loans) from the fed and state all go to students who barely make it to a &#8220;C&#8221; average and drop out in large numbers (thinking of all races of people). Give the bright ones, as well as the ones who really want to try and make good grades and are willing to stick the whole four years out, and who aren&rsquo;t lazy or looking for free money and whatnot, a chance. In other words, these laws will surely help to clean up our campuses! </p>

		<p>The sad parts of all this are that a proposition had to be posited at all and that only 60% of the voters in Arizona approved it. That means that fully 40% of those who voted think that discriminating against whites is o.k. This, of course, does not bring into account those who did not vote and those who are too young to vote. Sad indeed when the entire country was founded on the basic idea of fairness in civil affairs. Non-whites seem to be a negative as a whole and not a positive as our p.c. elites keep touting. As their numbers increase fairness to whites will decrease exponentionally.</p>

		<p><i> Yesterday Arizonans approved a ballot initiative that prohibits racial preferences in the state&rsquo;s public institutions, including public colleges and universities.</i></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t start celebrating just yet Arizonans.  You may be in for the fight of your lives, as we are in California defending Prop 209, passed by voters in 1996, upheld by the 9th Circus in 1997. </p>
<p> Prop 209   &mdash;   Article I, Section 31 of the California Constitution â€“ outlaws race- and sex-based preferences and discrimination in public education (including the UC system), public contracting and public employment. </p>
<p>Pacific Legal Foundation has spent the past 14 years defending challenges to Prop 209 as the UCs, cities and public works continue to defy its tenants.</p>
<p>PLF reports:</p>
<p><i>A lawsuit&hellip; was filed in February, in federal court in Oakland, by the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (known as BAMN). The suit challenges the constitutionality of Prop. 209&rsquo;s requirement for color-blind university admissions</i></p>
<p>This is just one of many lawsuits attacking Prop 209, but it&rsquo;s about to get a lot worse and the challengers will eventually win, especially after so much demographic change and yesterday&rsquo;s election:</p>
<p><i>Instead of standing up for Prop. 209 â€“ Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the UC Board of Regents â€“ have moved to be dismissed from the litigation, using claims of immunity, among other arguments. Unfortunately, PLF can&rsquo;t depend on California&rsquo;s public officials to defend this vital equal-rights guarantee in California&rsquo;s Constitution&hellip;The governor and the regents are trying to backpedal out of defending Prop. 209.</i> </p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i> Attorney General (now Governor) Jerry Brown has already tried to sabotage Prop. 209 by sending a brief to the state Supreme Court calling it unconstitutional.</i></p>
<p>Good Luck Arizona!</p>

		<p>Anonymous 3 - Private companies should be able to discriminate on whatever criterion they please.  It&rsquo;s called freedom of association.  Government agencies, public universities included, should not.  It&rsquo;s called equal treatment before the law.</p>

		<p>It is of more than tangential relevance to call attention to<br/>
the &#8220;quota&#8221; / &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; /  content of much of what amounts to public school reform or improvement, especially in urban settings.  The (politically) defined problem is always the failure of school success to take place so that winners are racially proportionate to local census head count data.  Success<br/>
Quotas. </p>

		<p>To bad I can&rsquo;t post a sign I got in the email from somewhere, it read as a survey in England where the question was asked: &#8220;are there to many foreigners in England: to which 18% replied YES and 82% said (a whole sentence written IN ARABIC!)to funny AND true!</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t count on this law being obeyed by colleges and universities. California passed a similar law, Prop 209, in 1996, that withstood court challenges; but I&rsquo;m not sure the University of California ever obeyed it. Here is a clip from an article written about it in 2007:</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1996, Californians voted to ban race and gender preferences in government and education. Ten years later, the chancellor of the state-funded University of California at Berkeley, Robert Birgeneau, announced a new Vice Chancellorship for Equity and Inclusion, charged with making Berkeley more &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; and &#8216;less hostile&rsquo; to &#8216;underrepresented minority &hellip; groups.&rsquo; This move is just the latest expression of the University of California&rsquo;s unrelenting resistance to the 1996 voter initiative, in every way possible short of patent violation. Stasi apparatchiks disappeared more meekly after the Soviet Empire&rsquo;s collapse than California&rsquo;s race commissars have retreated after voters tried to oust their preference regime.&#8221;</p>
