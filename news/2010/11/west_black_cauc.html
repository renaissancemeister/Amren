<h1>West: Black Caucus Promotes Welfare Dependency</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NewsMax, Nov. 21, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressman-elect Allen West says the Congressional Black Caucus has failed African-Americans by promoting dependence on government welfare programs. Still, the Florida Republican says he plans to join the organization, according to The Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Congressional Black Caucus cannot continue to be a monolithic voice that promotes these liberal social welfare policies and programs that are failing in the Black community, that are preaching victimization and dependency, that&rsquo;s not the way that we should go,&#8221; West said on Fox News Friday. &#8220;And those are not the types of principles that my mother and father raised me with in the inner city of Atlanta, Georgia.&#8221;</p>
<p>West is one of two black Republicans elected to Congress during the mid-term; Tim Scott of South Carolina says he won&rsquo;t join the CBC after it said it would welcome both men. West said despite his criticisms, his deceased parents would be &#8220;absolutely appalled&#8221; if he chose not to join the caucus.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, West also wants to censor Harry Reid for using a word that used to be the respectable word for the group of people that we now call &#8220;African Americans.&#8221;  See this:</p>

<p>I let myself get suckered by his soaring rhetoric at first, but now that I&rsquo;ve had more time to look at the situation, I now realize when you take away the oratorical skills of an above average inner city preacher, you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s really no there there when it comes to West.</p>
<p>I mean, this article by itself is proof   &mdash;   Would you go and join an organization you just bashed, even though your joining it won&rsquo;t make a difference in the reasons why you bashed it?  The CBC is going to be all about big government welfare spending and affirmative action out the yin yang (the latter I&rsquo;m sure helped West&rsquo;s Army career along), and it won&rsquo;t change even with one or two token semi-conservative blacks within it.</p>

		<p>West will be an interesting test case. He is an intelligent<br>
man who is capable of free thought. It will be very instructive<br>
if, in the end, when the chips are down, he ends up just another<br>
black hustler, much like Colin Powell. Will race trump all cards?<br>
We shall see. Already he is smoozing with the Black Caucus..because<br>
&#8220;his parents&#8221; expect it of him. Just why &#8220;his parents&#8221; couldnt<br>
be equally proud of his refusal to join such a corrupt race<br>
baiting organization as the CBC is never explained.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see the Leftists accuse THIS guy of &#8220;White racism&#8221; for what he said. Oh, yes, I forgot, he&rsquo;ll be an &#8220;Uncle Tom.&#8221; Look for him to get the &#8220;Gary Franks&#8221; treatment when he attends his first Black Caucus meeting; they&rsquo;ll probably announce that they&rsquo;re convening the &#8220;Black Democratic Caucus,&#8221; forcing him to leave.</p>
<p> I respect Congressman-elect West&rsquo;s desire to meet with his fellow blacks and try to talk some sense into them   &mdash;   but he&rsquo;ll be as lonely as a K member at a Black Muslim convention. I&rsquo;d say Congressman-elect Scott took the wiser course.</p>

		<p>I believe the term Allen West is looking for is &#8220;sold out&#8221;.  The Congressional Black Caucus has sold out African-Americans by promoting dependence on government welfare programs [in return for their vote].</p>
<p>In other words, black leaders have placed a type of slavery on to their own, so that they can get fat and rich, while the worst genetic social pathologies are indulged and intensified to serve the interests of communism.</p>
<p>Blacks in the US weren&rsquo;t always the monsters they are today.  There have always been problems because of a basic incompatibility between white civilization and the heavy genetic predisposition of blacks.  But, there was a time when most blacks were married, had stable families and few were criminals, drug fiends or psychopaths.  That has changed in a big way, as most on Amren know.  It is largely kept hidden by the mainstream media&hellip;..but that is increasingly becoming impossible.</p>
<p>In return for their 30 shekels of silver, black leaders have turned their own kind into a type of biological warfare weapon to disrupt white civilization and sow chaos.  Those responsible thought they could seize power and create a new world order with most people slaves to a small privileged class.  It didn&rsquo;t work&hellip;.and now the entire world is left with the task of cleaning up their mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting and extremely unrighteous.</p>
<p>It is also reversible.  Especially if new black leadership is of a different mind.</p>

		<p>West is a joke. He is like all the other black politicians, claiming to be &#8220;conservative&#8221; (JC Watts, Powell) but are nothing but anti-White when the chips are down. Watts and Powell, even Condoleeza, said they &#8220;liked&#8221; Obamas policies during his campaign and may vote for him!!! I am sure all three did vote for him.  They liked the fact he was black period and I will never ever vote for any nonwhite for any reason. They all lie. Race trumps all. Too bad that Whites don&rsquo;t say and do the same!</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a lone voice in the wilderness like Rep. West says. Blacks want things given to them and no amount of reason or logic is going to change them.</p>
<p>In the end, blacks are going to be dealt with by the only thing they understand and respect, the use of force.</p>

<p>More Whites falling all over themselves over a black &#8220;conservative&#8221; who tells it like it is?  If a White man tried to say these things he would be shouted down and called a racist, by those same White folks, wouldn&rsquo;t he?  </p>
<p>During the Civil Rights movement many Whites tried to tell it like it is and about how they opposed desegregation etc. and they were shouted down by the &#8220;conservative&#8221; Whites, weren&rsquo;t they?  They were right all along and now look at what our country has turned into. A hellhole with Whites  praising blacks just as they did with the commie, MLK!</p>

		<p>West denounces the CBC and yet still plans on joining them? He&rsquo;s probably just building up street credentials by paying lip service to conservative ideals but when all is said and done he&rsquo;s nothing more than a garden variety fake conservative black Republican. I wonder how all these odd candidates are managing to get elected or nominated like Allen West, Alvin Greene, Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham?  John McCain&rsquo;s dying Presidential campaign got jump started in SC.  Everyone holding office is a neocon.  Is there something in the water there?  </p>
