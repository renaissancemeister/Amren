			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Hutchison, Telegraph (London), Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As millions of Britons fell silent to remember those who have died in war a small group of protesters calling themselves Muslims Against Crusades held a demonstration in Kensington, West London. </p>
<p>Around 30 people gathered close to the junction of Exhibition Road and Kensington Road, adjacent to Hyde Park. </p>
<p>About 50 counter demonstrators gathered nearby but the two sides were kept apart by police. </p>
<p>Asad Ullah, of Muslims Against Crusades, said sparking violence &#8220;is not our intention&#8221; but added: &#8220;If it does, we are people who will defend our honour.&#8221; </p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are demonstrating because this day is a day of remembrance to remember every single fallen soldier, including those killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>
<p>&#8220;We find it disgusting that innocent people, innocent children, have been killed in an illegal and unjust war and we are demonstrating against that. </p>
<p>&#8220;We want the Government to pull the troops out from these countries and to stop interfering in our affairs.&#8221; </p>
<p>Asked how many people are at the demonstration, he said there are &#8220;about 30&#8221; but more are expected. </p>
<p>Mr Ullah added: &#8220;We would like to have a protest closer to the memorial but it is difficult to get access. We want to break the silence and say: &#8216;what about the silence for others that have died?&#8221;&rsquo; </p>
<p>The Muslims Against Crusades website includes graphic images of children wounded in warfare and the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib. </p>
<p>Earlier this year members of the group were involved in violent clashes with far-right groups during a troop march in Barking, east London. <br>

		<p>I am no fan of the Iraq war and think that the war in Afghanistan has dragged on long enough.  Nobody can even define what &#8220;victory&#8221; means in a place like Afghanistan.  But Muslims Against Crusades are mighty silent about how Islam was spread in the first place   &mdash;   by conquest.  Egypt was a Christian country before it was conquered by the Muslims.  So was Turkey.  So was Albania.  Persia was Christian, Zoroastrian, and Jewish before it was conquered by the Muslims.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We want the Government to pull the troops out from these countries and to stop interfering in our affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly UK muslims don&rsquo;t see themselves as UK citizens (although they demand more than equal treatment there) and this proves it.  </p>

<p>Europe&rsquo;s Mohammedans* are burning Europe&rsquo;s symbols only as a dress-rehearsal for burning Europe itself. <br>
 <br>
Today, poppies. <br>
 <br>
Tomorrow, infidels. </p>
<p>To a Muslim, poppies don&rsquo;t mean War and Remembrance   &mdash;   they mean a lucrative cash crop of raw materials for narcotics. Mohammedans&rsquo; sole interest in poppies is to grind them into powder so they can sell the powder to those (mostly in the West) who like to inject it via hypodermic needles. <br>
 <br>
Or, as Jeff Foxworthy puts it in one of his &#8220;You might just be Taliban&hellip;&#8221; jokes:<br>
 <br>
<i>&#8220;If you work in the heroin trade but you have a moral objection to wine&hellip; you might just be Taliban.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
* Yes, I know that nowadays it&rsquo;s not considered polite to call them &#8220;Mohammedans&#8221;. That&rsquo;s why I did it. </p>

		<p>Admittedly we should not be in their countries. We have no business being there. The West has been meddling in the Middle East since the end of WWI. It&rsquo;s time for us to get out of there. At the same time, we need to greatly restrict the entry of muslims into our world. We don&rsquo;t need them and certainly we should not tolerate their slowly but surely taking over in our lands. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, If Westerners were to stage a similar demonstration against something they found objectionable in one of those friendly, progressive Middle Eastern muslim nations like, for example, Saudi Arabia, they&rsquo;d be in the slammer promptly - probably awaiting beheading or, at very least, amputation of an arm. That&rsquo;s how it is in this brave new world gang. You will see!</p>

		<p>To Anonymous at 3:53.  That is EXACTLY what I thought.  You know, the more these people say this, the more we should point it out.  </p>
<p>I was watching a show the other night and a black astronaut was on it who was singing the praises of diversity on the space station saying a &#8220;Russian, French, Asian American and African American&rsquo; were all on board.  </p>
<p>It occurred to me that when speaking of non-White peoples in France, or Germany, we never hear the term &#8216;African English&rsquo; or &#8216;Asian French&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>How interesting that only WHITE AMERICANS are being marginalized like this.</p>

		<p>What I really, really despise about these Pakistanis is their sheer shameless, brazen unadulterated hypocrisy.<br>
They hate Britain.<br>
They hate the British people.<br>
They hate British culture, British institutions and the British Army.<br>
They hate absolutely everything British.</p>
<p>&hellip;.. and yet. And yet they VOLUTARILY continue to live in Britain, amongst a people and nation they hate and wish to destroy.If they were good men and true, they would go!! - They would refuse to have anything to do with what they hate and abominate, they would &#8216;vote with their feet&rsquo; and leave the society they abominate behind.<br>
   - and yet they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I have absolutely zero, nada, zilch respect for them.<br>
 That&rsquo;s why no one should respect them or have the slightest particle of symapthy for them.<br>
 A proud white man would rather eat dust than choose to stay amongst those whom he despises.<br>
  Evidently Pakisatnis think differently.</p>
<p>They are nothing but hypocrites, no more, no less.</p>

		<p>I have one firm prediction to make:</p>
<p>If by some miracle Britain ever got a hard-faced, no-nonsense racially conscience government that was tough and ruthless (rather like the Victorian British), then I guarantee you will see the Pakistanis to be the most grovelling, obsequieous, mouse-like cowardly race on the face of the Earth.I have no doubt about this - just read the history of British rule in India and the story of how one Major William Hodson single-handedly took on 2000 muslim insurgents there, faced them all down and won.<br>
    Unlike Europeans who when enraged beyond endurance will fight to the bitterest end (think of the Warsaw uprsing for example), the Pakistani deep down is nothing but a two-faced opportunistic coward.</p>

<p>Well Worthless Invader Ullah, I find it even more disgusting that the 9/11/01 and 7/7/05 attacks occurred. The life of so much as one white: man, woman, or child is worth more than the entire Muslim world combined. There is no sympathy for you, your people, or your and their &ldquo;jihad&rdquo; in my heart or mind, and there never will be. We should have used nuclear weapons on Mecca and Medina on 9/11/01 and we still should as a reminder, that your &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is a cult of anti-Western hate and your people are not fit to eat the scrapes that our pet dogs leave behind!</p>
<p>Enough said!!!</p>

		<p>Is anyone thinking now that the Crusaders were wrong?  How many times has Europe had to defend itself from the onslaught of the Muslim over the centuries?  We&rsquo;re so politically correct now that we seem forced to adore those who would slit our throats without a second thought.  Does anyone truly believe that this will come to a peaceful end?  I&rsquo;ll apologize for the Crusades on the same day that I apologize for the Confederacy.  In short, don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

Non-whites definitely don&rsquo;t like white people and their traditions. They will do what they can to take from them, including their way of life so as to dominate and indulge in the spoils that western society has given to them.</p>
<p>This will continue because whites and western society are tolerant and &#8220;they&#8221; are not.</p>
<p>White people - wake up, if not for yourselves, do it for the future generations. It&rsquo;s time to use some muscle and quit walking on egg shells.</p>

<p>Sure, he doesn&rsquo;t want violence    &mdash;   because they are outnumbered nearly 2 to 1, fifty to thirty.   Put them in the majority and see how their attitude changes!</p>
<p>PS. I am also opposed to these wasteful, meaningless, endless  wars that are not to our interest. But these are not &#8220;Crusades&#8221;!  To call them Crusades is ridiculous. Nobody is being forcibly converted to Christianity. No Moslems are being persecuted or expelled  or replaced because they are Moslems. To the contrary, we are extremely solicitous about respecting the religion and  customs of Moslems.  Much more so than I would like. </p>
