			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Liebrecht, Toronto Sun, November 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Controversy is brewing over a city-sponsored anti-racism campaign that calls on Caucasians to recognize their &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.</p>
<p>At least one Edmonton city councillor says the campaign makes a point, while a Conservative politician is saying the wording is all wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;A white person looking for an apartment to rent does not face similar challenges that an aboriginal person does,&#8221; said councillor Amarjeet Sohi, explaining what is meant by the phrase white privilege.</p>
<p>But Ryan Hastman, the federal Conservative candidate for the Edmonton-Strathcona, said he&rsquo;s concerned because the campaign&rsquo;s focus on white people is too narrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we try to address these issues by singling out groups, it seems to be counterproductive,&#8221; said Hastman, who posted some of his concerns on Twitter.</p>
<p>The City of Edmonton and 13 Edmonton organizations  &mdash;  including the Edmonton Police Service, Alberta Human Rights Commission and Edmonton Catholic Schools  &mdash;  are behind the Racism-Free Edmonton campaign.</p>
<p>The campaign is focused on identifying and resolving institutional barriers faced by aboriginal people and other racial groups in Edmonton, according to a City of Edmonton release.</p>
<p>The campaign aims to have 30,000 Edmontonians sign a scroll committing to defeating racism locally.</p>
<p>On the campaign&rsquo;s website, racismfreeedmonton.ca, under the &#8220;What can you do to stop racism&#8221; heading, the first line reads &#8220;acknowledge your white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White privilege refers to all the benefits we get just for being white. Most of us are aware of how racism hurts others, but we&rsquo;re not aware of how it benefits us,&#8221; the site reads.</p>
<p>It then paraphrases Dr. Peggy McIntosh, associate director of the Wellesley Collage Center for Research on Women, a U.S. college, and her 1989 paper &#8220;White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of us have little awareness of our white privilege. We&rsquo;re so used to having the benefits that come with being white that we don&rsquo;t even realize we have them. We also aren&rsquo;t aware of our privilege because the system has encouraged us not to be aware,&#8221; reads the website.</p>
<p>The site also encourages individuals to read media critically, learn Canada&rsquo;s history and listen to the stories of minority groups.</p>
<p>Hastman said he acknowledges racism is a problem, but prefers to overlook racial divides instead of focusing on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just speak for my gut reaction to it, which was this can&rsquo;t be the best way to go about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sohi said recognizing those differences is important.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am part of the culture, I am part of the history, I&rsquo;m part of the language and part of the tradition. I must feel proud of it, and I feel proud of it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone should feel proud of their own culture or heritage. But one is not more superior than another.&#8221;<br>

My &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; comes from the fact that I don&rsquo;t present myself in an obnoxious manner, I don&rsquo;t force myself on people, I don&rsquo;t hold other people responsible for the choices I made or make every day.</p>
<p>Is white privilege attending schools with near perfect attendance? Is white privilege studying for test so I could earn high grades? Is white privilege getting a job and showing up on time and not calling off or worse, not showing up and not calling off? Is white privilege keeping a quiet, low profile in public so I don&rsquo;t draw people&rsquo;s attention to me and I don&rsquo;t annoy people around me?</p>
<p>Is white privilege going to rent an apartment and having the landlord look at me and know I&rsquo;m not going to cause problems by my dress and demeanor?<br>

		<p>The indian writer says that one culture is not better than naother.  Excuse me, Hinduism burns widows or ostracizes those who will not jump on their husbands&rsquo; funeral pyre.  Hinduism has a very racist and unjust caste system. If a lower caste &#8216;untouchable&rsquo; touches a brahmin, he feels violated and has to take a bath!  Hinduism also believes in monkey gods and worshipping the private part of the god Shiva!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons more, but suffice it to say, I think in the heirarchy of cultures, moderate western liberalism, especially that of Canada, is far superior to anything out of the subcontinent!</p>

		<p>Most East Indians believe that deep inside they are racially and culturally superior to all other races and cultures. Anyone who has been to India will know what I am talking about. Next time you come across a South Asian anti-White racist like Sohi ask him how much percentage of India&rsquo;s population is black African? Since it is nearly 0% is it because Indians are racists? </p>

		<p>White Privilege, is this going to be yet another obnoxious term we are going to have to put up with ad nauseum? (Together with AA PC &amp; Empowerment)</p>
<p>Question 1, Have these do-gooders ever rented out an apartment or any other property to an &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221; ? I can assure them it will not be a happy experience even if the &#8220;Man from the Government&#8221; comes along and pays for the damage.(And after that you will never want to ever own another rental property, ever!)</p>
<p>Question 2, I am white and male but I do not own or drive eg. a Mercedes. Do I get upset when I see others driving one? Do I go and complain to the goverment or march in the street about people who own fancy consumer goods and seem to have some sort of special privelege. Of course not, I just accept the fact that the owner of the Mercedes or any other status symbol had probably worked hard to get it AND I dont expect him/her to give me a free ride in it let alone hand it over to me.</p>
<p>Dear Canada, my late grandfather came from your nation, helped build it in his small way, served in the Canadian Military forces.Thousands of others like him came from the UK and other parts of Europe to build the Canada you have now. I don&rsquo;t think they would like to see the free fall self destruct mode that Canada has now put itself into.</p>
<p>Wake up NOW Canada and and respect your proud hard working WHITE heritage.Later will be TOO LATE.</p>

<p>If one is not more superior than another and you&rsquo;re proud of your culture and heritage, why then are you living in a WHITE CHRISTIAN country &#8220;Sohi&#8221;? If we&rsquo;re all equal why is it we never hear of Whites risking their lives to get into a black\brown country - aside from the Amy Biehls of the world? Wouldn&rsquo;t you say that in your trashed out country there would be &#8220;brown privilege&#8221; and just what are you doing about that?<br>

<p><br>
Answer- Anti-White Privilege is foisted as a legitimate religious exercise by White Angry Feminists Who Have Never Known the Loving Touch of a White Man.  Look up Peggy McIntosh, and you will see bitterness.  These feminist took over the Episcopal Church and enjoyed so much power, they kept the game going by applying feminist liberation theology to their new pets, the blacks.</p>
<p>Anti-White Privilege uses the same tactics as Anti-Male Privilege.</p>
<p>The feminists just couldn&rsquo;t resist using James Cone&rsquo;s black liberation theology as a new weapon against their foe- White Men.</p>
<p>These women hate all White Men, so they elevate Blacks as idols above us.   It&rsquo;s all driven by anger, bitterness, envy, hatred, and in some cases, or most, vile lesbianism&rsquo;s quest to destroy all White Fathers of Beautiful White Daughters.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you be bitter with a vengeance if God did this to you? <a href="/iws/images/friday___whm_speakers/mcintosh.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uga.edu/iws/images/friday_&_whm_speakers/mcintosh.jpg</a><br>

		<p>What rampant idiocy!  &#8220;White privilege&#8221;, indeed.  What we enjoy is FOUNDER&rsquo;S privilege, thanks to the fact that we live in a nation that our White ancestors founded and built specifically for us.  It is no more or less than the &#8220;Family privilege&#8221; that one enjoys by being a member of a family.</p>
<p>It is incredible that someone named &#8220;Amarjeet Sohi&#8221; has the unmitigated gall to complain that the native offspring of the nation&rsquo;s founders enjoy privileges as a consequence of their very birth.  Well us tell, Amarjeet - what in the HECK is the purpose of building a nation in the first place, if it is not supposed to benefit one&rsquo;s descendants?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea - instead of moaning about the privileges that our race have developed for us, they could go back to their own nations and try to develop some for their own people.</p>

White privilege is good.  </p>
<p>I am glad I have it.  My parents, grandparents and all my ancestors worked hard to make sure that I would have it and pass it on to my children.</p>
<p>White privilege belongs to me and all white people.  It is valuable just like money.  It is wrong to steal money from a millionaire and it is wrong to steal white privilege from us. Anyone that tries to steal my money or my white privilege from me is my enemy.  </p>
<p>White privilege is a gift of the white race just like dunking a basketball or dancing is a gift of the black race.  Blacks inherited their gifts and the whites inherited theirs.  </p>
<p>It would be wrong not to allow blacks to take advantage of their dunk and dance gifts and it is wrong to not allow white people to take advantage of their white privilege gift.</p>
<p>Remember white privilege is not any good whatsoever in non-white countries.  There black privilege and yellow privilege are good.  So the next time a person tells you to give up your white privilege tell him to go to Africa or China and tell them to give up their black and yellow privilege.<br>

		<p>I urge a Canadian to send the politicians there my article, &#8220;White Male Privilege: A Social Construct for Political Oppression.&#8221;  Just google &#8220;white male privilege&#8221; and look for my name, usually on p. 1 or 2.  The phrase is used to justify oppressing whites.  Using the methods of the Left, one can see who really is the privileged.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -Hugh Murray</p>

		<p>The charge of &#8220;privilege&#8221; has no merit. It is a smear and the people who use it know it&rsquo;s a smear. They&rsquo;re just using it as a political club to beat whites with. That&rsquo;s what multiculturalism has wrought   &mdash;   racebaiting of the worst sort. Letting others run over us won&rsquo;t work. At some point we&rsquo;ll be forced to confront them.</p>

<p>Some cultures are clearly better than others. A culture where women get stoned to death for &#8216;infidelity&rsquo; is worthless, uncivilized and barbaric. Cheating on your partner is wrong, but it doesn&rsquo;t warrant death and it shouldn&rsquo;t be public business. </p>

		<p>Amarjeet Sohi, an Indian immigrant to Canada, does not want to defeat racism; he wants to defeat European men. European men have become ex-dominant males. That means that all non-white men will attack them. This is an instinctive strategy, inherited from chimpanzee forefathers. Women will mate with the winners.</p>

		<p>Acknowledge my white privilege? I&rsquo;d roll up the scroll and tell putrid Peggy to put it where the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine.</p>
<p>Watching as less talented blacks where given preferential treatment over me for scholarships and promotions? Having my race demonized because of them? Forced to pack heat to avoid being a victim to these brown thugs five times over? Being a woman myself, she&rsquo;s the type of female that makes me cringe.</p>
<p>I have never wished bad upon anyone, but this fool needs a good dose of multicultural reality.</p>

		<p>It is only in recent times that asiatic Indians have inundated Canada, making themselves one of he biggest ethnicities.<br>
 Previously asiatic Indians were denied entry and citizenship in Canada.Indians have rewarded the Canadian decision to let them in with a deliberate attempt to destroy the integrity and hegemony of white Canada.</p>

		<p>The concept of &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; has always baffled me. Who creates this &ldquo;privilege?&rdquo; What is stopping other races for creating these same privileges for themselves in their own neighborhoods or countries? Why is it always our job to provide for people of other races?  I suppose it is now a crime to be white, have a high IQ, and a strong work ethic. </p>

		<p>I, a white man, have the privilege of food and water, clothing and warmth, because my forebears worked hard. It&rsquo;s not &#8220;privilege&#8221;, it&rsquo;s &#8220;inheritance&#8221;.</p>
<p>Should I be punished because Mr Sohi&rsquo;s ancestors didn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t work as hard?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Everyone should feel proud of their own culture or heritage. But one is not more superior than another.&rdquo;  This statement is a give away of the third worlders&rsquo; psyche.  they come to an advanced civilization expecting to be seen as an equal!  they come for the looting = welfare, free health care, free housing, if refused = racism as this article is really pointing out.  white privilege?  for god&rsquo;s sake, it a country built by white brain power so it is a country belonging to white&rsquo;s.  third worlders have learned their lesson well how to manipulate.  congress/dimocract party dare not question barry obama&rsquo; questionable citizenship status.  why?  because he is black and afraid of called racists.  whites need to stand up to all this craziness instead of running for cover.  in the past, this nonsense would have been stopped long ago but that generation is dying as the hispanics repeatedly keep pointing out and boasting how they will take this country without firing a single shot. </p>

		<p>I will say the following for Mr. Sohi,</p>
<p>1.  He has a real job, as a bus driver.<br>
2.  He has been &#8216;active in the community&rsquo; for at least 3 years.<br>
3.  He has been seated on two Council Wards.<br>
4.  Instead of the median 2.7 (urban) or 2.9 (rural) kids you <br>
    would expect from an Indian couple in India, he is the <br>
    father of only one daughter.</p>

<p>That said, despite what is thrown about here, I don&rsquo;t think a lot of white women are physically attracted to non-whites to be interested in marrying them, no matter what the economic SES advantages.  They may not think much of the field of white candidate husbands but they still want to find someone from their own race to marry and raise a family with.  To position their genes optimally within our race group.  I humbly salute them for this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such an attitude, accompanied by unrestricted import of ethnic wage slaves, means that every man or woman from X national group which is not white is one for whom a mate has to be imported.  And -their- children&rsquo;s inheritance assured through a viable population base of alternative choices (say 10 kids of 8 other couples) whom they could find marriageably attractive and socially available.</p>
<p>Not all of those couples will have one or two children and so the base population grows and becomes a competitive threat.</p>
<p>If assimilation doesn&rsquo;t happen because we do not like the look or mannerism of exogroups in comparison with our own, &#8216;privilege&rsquo; is thus not only lost to our group but _lowered_, overall, for every slice of the economic pie that is cut which can never have a common bite taken back.</p>
<p>And that is tragic because it is a guaranteed way to lower the total wealth of a nation and it&rsquo;s classes/castes to a level where nobody is happy, because the synergies of productivity are forever divided.</p>
<p>To become India, even without India&rsquo;s massive population problems.</p>
<p>And the way such difficulties are traditionally handled, through tribal/racial conflict to a genocidal expulsion of competitor groups* is also being rapidly denied Canada by the sheer numbers (250K+, per year) involved.  If whites entered into civil war with such huge, Army/Corps sized, groups, absent professional military skills, the outcome would be nearly random, on a last man standing basis of geographic isolation.</p>
<p>If not our doom, then certainly our &#8216;containment&rsquo; to within much weakened caste systems, is thus being deliberately engineered, day by day.  This despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that Whites are the only populations willing to trade absolute numbers for relative quality of life.</p>
<p>And our Elites can&rsquo;t make a profit off of efficiency like they can profligacy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Which, is not a phenomenon restricted to Hitler but is clearly the defactor mode of conflict resolution for most primitive human populations, including whites, for most of history.  Rwanda and Darfur are not extremes but medians.  Zimbabwe and South Africa are the unusual.</p>

		<p>No one ever talks about &#8220;black privilege&#8221;. You know being able to have free health care, free food, free housing and first &#8220;dibs&#8221; on college scholarships because of the legacy of slavery and a racist society without lifting a finger. I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you but I am damn tired of paying for the dregs of the American society and at the same time being told I&rsquo; am racist because my family and I  work hard and EARNED everything we have. There is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

		<p>These sorts of things is ONLY for the advancement of MUSLIMS! There is no such thing as a Pakistani that is not a musim and they are 3rd in line as the nastiest muslims of all, behind the Somalis, Ethiopians and Nigerians&hellip;.Of course the Saudi men are the most despicable of all the muslims. Saudi and Kuwaiti women are a totally different matter as most would at the first opportunity (if they could avoid being killed by male relatives) bail out of the muslim ideaology.</p>

		<p>The blue-collar, working class, white laborers of America, do not know what &#8220;privilege&#8221; is because they work for a living.  Nothing&rsquo;s handed to them on a silver platter, they earn their place through hard work and responsible action.  Being dependable and responsible earns them the trust and respect from their bosses.  They know the government does not give them anything, only takes through taxes.</p>
