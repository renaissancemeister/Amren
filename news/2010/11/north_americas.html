<h1>North America&rsquo;s Northernmost Mosque Opens</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lexington Herald-Leader, Nov. 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The northernmost mosque in North America officially opened Wednesday, marking an end to an arduous journey that saw the building shipped 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) over narrow, bumpy roads and atop a river barge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Inuvik, a town of 3,300 people north of the Arctic Circle, has some 80 Muslim residents who until recently have met for prayers and religious education inside a small trailer. Hussain Guisti, a member of a Winnipeg-based Muslim charity called The Zubaidah Tallab Foundation, decided last year he would help design and build a mosque for the northern community. </p>
<p>The group originally wanted the mosque to be built in Inuvik but soon realized having a prefabricated building constructed in Winnipeg would be much less expensive, even with the lengthy shipment factored in.</p>
<p>Inuvik Mayor Denny Rodgers said there is no sign of the type of animosity encountered by new mosques in some parts of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re very much a multicultural town up here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Canada itself is a melting pot, and Inuvik, when you look at all the different cultures that are represented here, is just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were only a handful of Muslims in the town 20 years ago, according to Guisti. Like many northern communities, Inuvik has a near-constant supply of job opportunities that has attracted people from all backgrounds.</p>

		<p>Disgusting!  Just 16 years ago, the Canadian government decides to give Eskimos a territory of their own.  And know, they&rsquo;re letting that territory go to foreigners.  What&rsquo;s the point in gaining autonomy if your people face displacement in the near future anyway?  Its kind of like how the Scottish and Welsh National Parties support increased autonomy, under the idea of the nation state, and then unwittingly work to destroy the nation state with massive immigration.  Well, 80 Muslims out of a population of 3,300 isn&rsquo;t too bad, but its only the tip of the iceberg, we can presume.</p>

<p>WAIT! until there are 800 muslims there, then the fun begins.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Inuvik, a town of 3,300 people&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the al Arabiya news source, &#8220;The majority of Muslims (who number 75 - 80) in Inuvik are from Sudan and there are a few from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. </p>
<p>&#8220;One third of Inuvik Muslims work as cab drivers, while others own restaurants, grocery stores, barber shops, and security companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a sad state of affairs that the locals could not have opened these small businesses themselves. The entreprenurial spirit of doing one&rsquo;s own accounting, taxes, business licensing, and dealing with certifications and red tape develops a community of citizens engaged in their own governance.</p>
<p>Small business owners are the backbone of the community. If the residents of Inuvik, the native Inuits and whites, are allowing business-savvy Muslims to run everything, they are relinquishing the heart of their community to a transient &#8216;ferengi&rsquo;-like people. </p>
<p>It reminds me of places in Africa, where East Indians are the entrepreneurs and professionals catering to the indolent blacks. </p>

		<p>The world´s northermost mosque is now planned in Tromsø, Norway, paid for by Saudi-Arabians.</p>
<p>Surprisingly the Norwegian foreign minister at one point came out against the idea, stating &#8220;It would be a paradox and unnatural to accept funding from sources in a country where there is no religious freedom&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates of Vienna: <a href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/22kkoz3" rel="nofollow">http://preview.tinyurl.com/22kkoz3</a></p>
<p>Less surprisingly, he later partly backed away from this statement. There´s a heated debate in Tromsø now whether this mosque should be built or not.<br>
