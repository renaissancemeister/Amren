<h1>12th Grade Students Still Below &#8216;92 Reading Scores</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Armario, Washington Post, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A national education assessment released Thursday shows that high school seniors have made some improvement in reading, but remain below the achievement levels reached nearly two decades ago. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Students scored an average of 288 out of 500 points in reading comprehension, two points above the 2005 score but still below the 1992 average of 292. Thirty-eight percent of 12th grade students were classified as at or above the &#8220;proficient&#8221; level, while 74 percent were considered at or above &#8220;basic.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The trouble advancing student reading skills extends across grade levels. Reading scores for fourth and eighth grade students in 2009 were only four points higher than in 1992. </p>
<p>The No Child Left Behind law championed by President George W. Bush set a goal for every student to read and do math at their grade level by 2014, but the national assessment scores indicate students are still trailing significantly behind. In 2009, 33 percent of fourth grade and 32 percent of eighth grade students scored at the proficient level in reading. </p>
<p>In a statement, Duncan noted that President Barack Obama set a goal for the United States to have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the end of the decade, and that in a survey that accompanied the reading and math test, 86 percent of seniors said they expect to graduate college. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The scores released Thursday also show that a stubborn achievement gap remains across racial and ethnic groups. There was no significant change in the score or gap in reading for black and or Hispanic students since 1992. White and Asian students both scored higher than they did in 2005. </p>
<p>Asian students scored an average of 298 points in reading in 2009, higher than any other group. It was the first time since at least 1992 that a minority group outperformed white students on the test. </p>
<p>Orr said further analysis, including a look at course-taking pattern, is needed to further explain the advancements Asian students have made in recent years. </p>

The decline is probably due to a declining percentage of white and East Asian students.  </p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that the &#8216;gap&rsquo; is increasing? The only thing I notice in this article by Christine Armario is that the gap, between WASP reporters and the vibrant reporters brought in from overseas to replace them, is increasing, as this is a poorly written article. </p>

		<p>Increasing numbers of white students are in private schools, and the ones left in the public schools are too busy avoiding daily mayhem, chaos and possible bodily harm to learn as much as they have the potential for. Also classes have been increasingly dumbed-down to increase the self-esteem of students who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t learn. Government controlled public schools have been proven to be a failure. They need to be dissolved and something else tried.</p>

<p>Perhaps clarification is needed, who is being classified as white?  If whites are still classified as what was used prior to say 1950 and their gene pool is kept undiluted, then the white&rsquo;s IQ/academic achievement would always rank among the highest globally.  But now it is the reverse due to affirmative action = dumbing down and the interbreeding with blacks/hispanics.</p>

		<p>In his book Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing American Schools Back to Reality, Charles Murray argues that most Americans are learning as much as they can and spend too many years in school, and that national performance levels cannot be significantly raised.   <br>
 <br>
It is not a message Americans want to hear, but it seems true whenever another disappointing report is released about school performance.  </p>

		<p>The answer to this disaster is as clear as the big ears on Obama`a head. 34% of white kids are born out of wed lock along with only 75% of black kids. Bastardy equals penury and breeds more bastardy,crime and degenerate behavior and a lack of educational achievement. Nobody dares talk about it.Some schools in DC have entire classes where no kid lives in a home with his biological parents in wed lock. Women`s liberation, abortion on demand, no draft all have contributed to the break up of families or more correctly never get them started. The lefty Monihan warned us about this 30 years ago when the rates were &#8221; only &#8221; 16% and 33%. What do the Chineeze, Japaneeze and Koreans do that whites et.al. don`t? Simple, they get married and stay married. Untill you see Obama telling 6 grade girls that having babies without a husband is not only stupid but treasonous and telling the boys that he will draft every non-married one of them who has fathered a child so he can serve his country and pay for his kid or kids, we will still be on a collision course for serdom to the yellow peril.<br>

		<p>I think all would agree that discrimination is far less prevalent now than two decades ago, yet student test scores are lower.  Alarm bells should be ringing that here in the US in the current times certain groups&rsquo; declining educational scores are influenced by factors other than discrimination.  And addressing those other factors will have greater results than focusing on ever increasing far-reaching remedies for discrimination.  Further it is yet another reason why US government&rsquo;s anti-discrimination remedies forwarded to assuring equal opportunity at other groups&rsquo; expense are foolish and ineffectual aside from being unfair to the betterment of the larger society.  Did I mention illegal?</p>

		<p>If you THINK about it, 298 out of 500 is only 3/5 of the max score.  In other words, they are accepting a 60 percent reading comprehension as GOOD.  Excuse me?  We all KNOW why (1) scores and comprehension have continually degraded since 1992, and if compared to scores from 1970 we would be horrified at how stupid (or held back) students are now compared to 40 years ago.  We also know (2) why the &#8220;gap&#8221; between whites and asians compared to all other minorities will NEVER be closed.  Never.<br>
It&rsquo;s a simple matter of IQ.  One way of looking at IQ is to view it as the POTENTIAL for comprehension and analytical thought.  Low IQ, low potential for comprehension and critical/analytical thought (which includes math skills).  WHEN did average scores begin to degrade, and a &#8220;gap&#8221; appear?  When schools began to be integrated.  It&rsquo;s that simple.  Just as blacks make ANY neighborhood unsafe to walk through, blacks make ANY classroom not only unsafe, but impossible to learn in.  And, we know they have borderline retarded IQ levels.  IQ is NOT a measure of what you have learned or knowledge obtained.  It is a measure of innate ability to comprehend and analyze.  In other words, your potential for learning.  Which is WHY the liberal academic community can NEVER talk about IQ as one factor in test scores.</p>

		<p>If we were to test only white students and compare those to 40 or 50 years ago, I&rsquo;m not sure you would see much of a difference. The East Asian students might have scores similar to those of whites. Why don&rsquo;t we compare suburban school districts and their inner-city counterparts? This can be easily explained once you remove the political correctness.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Five states had higher scores in both subjects than the national average: Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and South Dakota. Two states, Idaho and Illinois, had scores that were higher in reading but not significantly different in math. New Jersey had a higher math score but a similar national reading score. Three states scored lower in both subjects: Arkansas, Florida and West Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five states with higher scores on both sections: Predominantly White Children. (except for Boston, Mass.) If you eliminate the Chicago Public School System, Illinois and Idaho are also mostly White. Florida is trending Hispanic and also has a lot of both rural and urban blacks. Arkansas and West Virginia are primarily rural.</p>
<p>Granted, I don&rsquo;t want to set up our school systems exactly like those in Europe, but some of the ideas are pretty good. If you gave every kid in 1st - 5th grade an IQ test twice a year, there would be a pretty good case for segregating the kids once they start to middle and high school. Sort out the dim bulbs and let the bright kids continue. Imagine the following conversation between Jasmine Williams, mother of 10 y.o. Quantavious Jackson, and Albert Stanley, a soon to be retired assistant principal at MLK elementary:</p>
<p>Ms. Williams, the staff at MLK elementary calls in all of the parents of the students who are completing 5th grade. We want to let you know what Quantavious can do in the future. Where do you see him in 20 years?</p>
<p>JW: Quantavious going to Medical School! He gonna be a doctor.</p>
<p>AS: Uh-huh; Ms. Williams, we have five years worth of IQ tests on Quantavious and his average for that time is 81. The high was 82, the low 79. He was pretty consistent. The reality is that Quantavious would need a score of 115 to be competitive for college and a starting score in the 125 - 130 range for Medical School. He is not even college material. There are jobs he can do, but being a doctor is not going to happen. </p>
<p>JW: That the problem with this school, it just rayciss!</p>
<p>AS: Ms. Williams, this school receives over $12,000 per child every year. That is not racism, especially when rural districts  in this state get $8500 per child. By the way, where is Quantavious&rsquo; biological father?</p>
<p>JW: Last I heard, he was doing 3 - 5 for armed robbery. I don&rsquo;t know where.</p>
<p>AS: Ms. Williams, what is your primary source of income?</p>
<p>JW: I get some welfare, food stamps, section 8, and 3 of my four kids get &#8220;Crazy Checks&#8221;. The youngest is only 2.</p>
<p>AS: Ms. Williams, under the new state guidelines, Quantavious will be sent to Al Sharpton Middle School in preparation for a trade. His education will end at the end of the 8th grade. Federal law has been relaxed somewhat to allow children who are 14 to start apprentice programs. </p>
<p>JW: They just holding him down. He gonna be a doctor.</p>
<p>AS: Nobody is holding him back, but the reality is that he does not have the ability to do that kind of work. He is almost 50 IQ points below what is needed to be successful. <br>
    <br>
     In the 6th grade, the kids will be introduced to trades based on their ability to learn. In the 7th grade, they will start a chosen program. </p>
<p>JW: If he get a job, I lose his crazy check. He going to be a doctor. </p>
<p>AS: Let&rsquo;s hope that Quantavious doesn&rsquo;t end up in the system. </p>

		<p>Google &#8220;Monta Vista High School&#8221;- It&rsquo;s a high school in Silicon Valley where the white-minority gap is reversed. The &#8220;minority&#8221; students who make up 80 percent of the school&rsquo;s population is scoring much higher than the white population. It is because virtually all the minorities are Asians (an even mix of East Asian and South Asian). How come liberals don&rsquo;t try to ever close this gap? And also they blame cultural bias for the low test scores of &#8220;minorities&#8221; but these recent immigrants have a bigger cultural gap than blacks who were born and raised here but they do better than whites. </p>

		<p>Federal aid to public schools has tripled in recent years. Bush and Obama cannot shovel enough deficit dollars into programs that benefit consultants and state bureaucrats. </p>
<p>However, these programs have utterly failed, from Title I for poor blacks, school lunches for obese students who munch chips all day, from bilingual and ESOL, from special ed programs that pour money into small classes and tutors for kids who don&rsquo;t pay attention and have IQ&rsquo;s above the retardation level. </p>
<p>In the old days, when American kids learned and led the world, we either slapped the snoozers and lazy kids or flunked them. Then their parents would whomp them and they would learn. </p>
<p>This all however goes against the &#8220;research&#8221; beloved by the Dept of Education in Washington and in all state depts of education. Billions for the same old teaching development programs which is basically, dumb it down, give the kids multiple choice proficiency tests, and give them a diploma.</p>
<p>Contract out US education to the Chinese for ten years including unlimited discipline rights and legal immunity from wrongful death and brutality suits, and you will find US reading and math back to where it was 50 years ago. Of course, the Chinese may not want to leave. </p>
<p>On the other hand, our &#8220;business&#8221; leaders don&rsquo;t seem to come up with anything useful for employees to do other than to complete insurance and medical data forms, so contract out the whole country. Perhaps the Chinese would have useful &#8220;advice&#8221; about the composition of the workforce and affirmative action as well. </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be any worse off. (No we are not a sovereign nation anyway, so don&rsquo;t bring that red herring up).</p>

		<p>&#8220;The scores released Thursday also show that a stubborn achievement gap remains across racial and ethnic groups. There was no significant change in the score or gap in reading for black and or Hispanic students since 1992.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1992 there were far fewer latinos of any type, and back then they were scarcely ever mentioned nationally.  </p>
<p>These &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo; percentages are skewed ever downward, and STUPID liberals don&rsquo;t want to acknowledge this, by an ever increasing, largely illiterate, latino immigration surge.</p>
<p>And in the case of blacks, hasn&rsquo;t billions of dollars been spent on this or that new program to fix it?  After 20 years, it&rsquo;s worse?  I think the nation should get a refund.</p>
<p>Now they think they need to break the teacher unions and replace teachers with temporary workers who can be hired and fired at will?  (My wife works in a charter school and says this is the score now.)</p>
<p>Who wants to send their kids to a school where nearly all the teachers are 23 years old and know next to nothing?  Give me the 50 year old teacher any day over a &#8216;social justice&rsquo; greenhorn who has little to no actual content knowledge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see this.  In 7th grade (1970 era) we had a teacher, American, ex-USAF, &gt;250 lbs. solid muscle, who got working-class and poor students to learn a little of what was then college-level molecular biology.  Yes, we had townie kids talking in the hallways about purines and pyrimidines.  Most of my knowledge of cellular workings comes from this course, not HS biology.  There was a ton of botany material also.  I still remember the the formula for chlorophyll (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) from this course:  C 55 H 72 0 5 N 4 Mg .  </p>
<p>How this happened is that this teacher was known throughout the entire city for his temper along with the muscularity to back it up.  First day of class, I noticed large, long cracks in the blackboard.  I was told that his fists (one of which was nerve-damaged in WWII so he could punch without feeling pain) made the cracks.  I later saw him add to the collection of cracks.  This was nothing compared to the year before, when he threw a student to the ground and stepped on him with one foot, or three years before, when he opened a third-floor window and hung a student by the arms out of that window.  </p>
<p>We learned the connections between ADP/ATP (*adeno*sine X-phosphate) and the adenine in DNA because we were scared to death.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Legal immunity from wrongful death and brutality suits&#8221; could work wonders. <br>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   <br>
 <br>
The persistence of the gap in academic performance is impressive evidence that the arguments presented in The Bell Curve are valid. Liberals pretend that The Bell Curve has been decisively disproven. Because they know otherwise, they try to suppress a candid discussion of the relationship between genes, IQ, success in life, crime, and race. <br>
 <br>
The Bell Curve is the specter at the feast whenever liberals gather to pretend that more social welfare spending would solve the problems of the inner cities. Democrats lose elections because white blue collar workers do not want their taxes spent on futile efforts to help the underclass perform at white levels. </p>
