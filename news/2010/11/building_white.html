	<p> <span class="dropcap">T</span>homas Hardy is supposed to have said 
that men and women generally take different views of reform. Men, he 
argued, seem to think they have to remake the entire world in order to 
be happy in their little corner of it, whereas women tend to concentrate
 on improving their corner, and leave the rest of the world alone. </p>

        <p> In this respect, <i>American Renaissance</i> is a typically 
masculine undertaking. It is full of articles about the larger society, 
written clearly in the hope of changing society. <i>AR</i> is an almost 
touching expression of faith in Richard Weaver&rsquo;s famous dictum, &#8220;Ideas 
have consequences.&#8221; It sends powerful ideas out into the world in the 
hope that they will have powerful consequences. </p>
        <p> I note that over the years readers have written to complain that <i>AR</i>
 does a good job of explaining what the problems are, but has little to 
say about how to solve them. These people are not asking for suggestions
 about how to change their little corner of the world. They are men who 
want to know what they can do personally to help change the world. </p>
        <p> I hope and believe that some day the ideas promoted by AR 
and other racially aware publications will change the world, but this 
will not happen soon. It will be some time before people who think as we
 do are setting policy. In the meantime, it is worth considering Hardy&rsquo;s
 female approach. As we work to promote a general understanding of race,
 how can we also improve our little corners of the world? </p>
        <p> I once met a group of Identity Christians, who almost 
perfectly demonstrated Hardy&rsquo;s view of the sexes. One of the men told me
 he was working on a way to reconcile Biblical creationism with the 
geological evidence for evolution. He explained to me that he was 
finally approaching a solution: Whites were created but the other races 
evolved from primitive life forms. </p>
        <table class="quoteleft">

        <p> The women had other priorities. They had set up a network 
for passing around baby clothes as children outgrew them. They were also
 working on a pro-white coloring book with practical instruction for 
children. Mixed in with Charles Martel and President Polk, there was a 
page with an automatic pistol and a message that said something like: 
&#8220;This is Daddy&rsquo;s gun. If you find it, don&rsquo;t touch it. Tell Mommy or 
Daddy right away.&#8221; As one of the women explained, many people in their 
circle have guns, and children need to be reminded of gun safety. Thomas
 Hardy would not have been surprised: The man was working out who was 
created and who evolved, while the women were making sure the children 
had clothes and didn&rsquo;t shoot each other. </p>
        <p> The women were particularly interested in children   &mdash;   and 
rightly so. Our children must grow up with healthy racial views, and yet
 they are uniquely vulnerable to bad influences in countless ways we are
 not. </p>
        <p> Adults can live in a world full of anti-white, anti-&#8220;racist&#8221;
 propaganda without being affected by it, because people who have gained
 a sound understanding of race are not likely to lose it. People do not 
give up a view of the world that explains so much for one that leaves 
life full of mysteries. Once we have taken off the blinders, we see the 
racial double standards clearly, we know which part of the story the 
newscasters left out, and we see how desperately every American 
institution distorts the truth. The foolishness we read and hear may 
infuriate us, but the propaganda is so simple-minded no one who has seen
 through it will ever be duped again. And even if our neighbors and 
associates are conventional liberals, we are part of a community of 
publications, conferences, and Internet discussion groups. </p>

        <p> Things are much more difficult for children. Simple-minded 
propaganda works on them because they have simple minds. At the same 
time, no matter how racially healthy their homes may be, the pressure to
 conform to the outside world is tremendous. Children hate to be 
different, and today, a child whose mind is not poisoned is different. 
How do we protect children from propaganda and from the pressures of 
conformity? </p>
        <p> I can cite several examples of the dangers. I have gently 
done my best to give my children healthy racial views, but I have not 
always succeeded. I am from a family of Southerners, and over the years,
 I have tried to interest my 10-year-old daughter in her Confederate 
ancestors. I have not been very successful. The Confederacy does not get
 much respect either at school or among her friends, and what I say has 
little effect. However, some months ago I took her to see the movie <i>Gods and Generals,</i>
 which is about the early years of the War Between the States. It paints
 as realistic a picture as possible, and offers a sympathetic portrait 
of Stonewall Jackson. His death, after the battle of Chancellorsville, 
with his wife by his side, is a very moving scene. </p>
        <p> This single movie affected my daughter more than anything I 
ever said to her. She marched out of the theater a staunch Confederate, 
and remains one to this day. The results on this occasion happen to have
 been good, but this only proves the extraordinary power of film, and we
 all know the insidious message that is most often on the screen. </p>
        <p> At school, children try to please their teachers, and what 
pleases them is standard anti-&#8220;racism.&#8221; In grade school one year, my 
daughter had a choice of several biographies on which to write a report.
 I was surprised to find that one of the choices was the life of Robert 
E. Lee, and I encouraged her to read about him. One day, she came home 
from school and announced she had chosen her book. &#8220;I thought about 
General Lee,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I chose Rosa Parks instead.&#8221; She later 
reported that the book was the most boring thing she had ever read, but 
she decided to please her teacher and classmates rather than her father.
 This is hardly surprising. </p>

        <p> How can we give our children a proper start in life? In the October 2001 issue of AR there is an excellent article about <a href="/ar/2001/10/index.html">rearing honorable white children</a>.
 Prof. Robert Griffin of the University of Vermont profiled a number of 
families that have taken their racial responsibilities seriously, and 
who have arranged their households so as to instill sound racial and 
cultural values. These are inspiring stories, and the children will no 
doubt benefit greatly. However, these families all did something not all
 families can do: They taught their children at home rather than send 
them to school. </p>
        <p> Home schooling is, of course, the only way to control what 
children learn, but not every family can do it. Even if an adult is home
 all day, not all parents or children are temperamentally suited to home
 schooling. Also, a single, self-contained family is not a community. 
Children need playmates. </p>
        <p> What would be ideal is a place where the neighbors think as 
we do, and where the school teachers, the mayor, and the fire chief do, 
too. We need a community of racially conscious whites who build   &mdash;   simply
 by being together   &mdash;   the healthy atmosphere whites used to take for 
granted. </p>
        <p> As a father, I am particularly conscious of the benefits 
such a community would have for children, but it would have great 
benefits for adults, too. How pleasant it would be for a neighborhood 
get-together to feel like an <i>American Renaissance</i> conference. At 
the last conference I attended, someone said to me, &#8220;It&rsquo;s great to be 
among the living again.&#8221; It would be wonderful to <i>live </i>among the living. </p>
        <table class="boxleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2004/11/NUWAUBsml.JPG" alt="" width="288" height="268" /> </td>

            <th class="photocaption"> Not the way to do it. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> The most important aspect of such a community would be the 
education it offered children. Any group that is out of step with the 
mainstream in any fundamental way   &mdash;   and, for the time being, 
racially-conscious whites are radically out of step   &mdash;   must be able to 
rear children in a way that supports dissident thinking. </p>
        <p> Would it be difficult to gather together the nucleus of such
 a community? Certainly it would, but it would be easier than electing a
 racially healthy Congress or state legislature. At the same time, even a
 small zone of healthy white consciousness could become a base for 
efforts at achieving larger changes. Sooner or later, whites will form 
communities of their own, and the sooner we begin, the more successful 
we will be. </p>
        <p> Communities of like-minded people do not spring up by 
accident. People have to build them, and Americans have a long history 
of building them. Most such people, like the Amish and the Shakers and 
Mormons, have had religious motives, but Americans have gathered for all
 kinds of reasons, some of them completely harebrained. Until recently, a
 black man named Dwight York, a convicted rapist who claimed to have 
come from the planet Rizq, ran the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors at a
 compound not far from Eatonton, Georgia. One hundred fifty Nuwaubians 
lived at the site, practicing an odd mixture of invented and Egyptian 
religion. They would still be there if it had not come to light that Mr.
 York was molesting little Nuwaubian girls. </p>
        <p> An even more extreme example was Jim Jones and his Peoples 
Temple. He managed to get more than 900 people to move to Guyana and 
build a town in which they could practice their religion. They built a 
system to train members in their dissident views, but it began to 
unravel, and on Nov. 18, 1978, they all committed suicide. The point 
here is that even crazy people can leave their old lives and build 
communities. Sane white people should certainly be able to do 
considerably better. </p>
        <p> Probably the best-known example of a group that has built 
its own institutions to maintain a sharply dissident way of life is the 
Amish. They have been very successful in preserving a way of life 
completely at odds with the rest of America, but they are not a good 
model for racially-conscious whites. They have farm communities that 
have been established, in some cases, for centuries. Most 
racially-conscious whites are not farmers, and they need to form new 
communities, not carry on the ones into which they were born. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> The Amish also have an unusual education system. They study 
in private, one-room schools that go up only to 8th grade. The Amish and
 Mennonites received a special Supreme Court exemption in 1972 from 
state requirements for education beyond middle school, successfully 
arguing that their people learn wisdom in the household and behind the 
plow, and that secondary schools are purveyors of temptation and 
worldliness. Racially conscious whites have the same distrust of high 
schools, but most would rather fix them than abolish them. </p>
        <p> There are other successful dissident communities, 
established much more recently, with the express intention of building 
institutions to encourage a way of life at odds with the mainstream. 
These are the Orthodox Jewish towns of Monroe, Monsey, and New Square, 
all in New York. As a rule, Orthodox Jews have a head start on community
 because they are forbidden to drive on the Sabbath and must walk to 
temple services. This means they cannot live very far away from each 
other. </p>
        <p> However, in these three cases they have gone much further, 
and have established all-Orthodox towns that reflect their desire to 
build institutions in which they can rear their children. If anything, 
Orthodox Jews are more out of step with the rest of America than 
racially-conscious whites, and they understand that without communities,
 without schools for their children, their way of life will disappear. </p>
        <p> Jews founded New Square and Monroe as entirely new 
settlements. New Square got its start in 1953, when an Orthodox 
congregation bought an old farm, and parceled it out as lots. New Square
 now has a population approaching 10,000. Monroe was established in the 
mid-1970s by a larger congregation, and has a population of about 
20,000. All the schools in both Monroe and New Square are private. </p>
        <p> Monsey developed differently, and is perhaps the most 
promising model for racially-conscious whites. It was an ordinary, 
gentile town that began to develop as an Orthodox community after a 
seminary was founded there and many graduates decided to stay. Once a 
Yeshiva was built for younger students, Monsey became a center in which 
Orthodox Jews of all ages had the institutions they needed. The Orthodox
 from the entire area started moving in, and residents found they could 
sell their houses for a hefty premium. Soon Monsey was overwhelmingly 
Orthodox. There were no doubt some gentiles who were sorry to see their 
community transformed within a generation, but they had the consolation 
of getting out at a nice profit. This has certainly not been the case 
for millions of whites displaced by blacks or Mexicans. </p>
        <table class="boxleft">
          <tbody><tr>

          <tr>
            <th class="photocaption"> Not quite right either. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> These three towns are now completely stable, with more 
people wanting to move in than there are spaces available. Owners will 
not sell to anyone who is not Orthodox   &mdash;   not even to other Jews   &mdash;   and 
though this is against the law, only the Orthodox want to buy houses 
there anyway. The schools are Orthodox, the mayor is Orthodox, and all 
the plumbers and painters are Orthodox. These towns do not have police 
forces because the only crimes are parking violations. Parents have the 
perfect set of institutions within which to rear children, and Orthodoxy
 has a guaranteed future. </p>
        <p> The school system is the key to a successful community. 
Children cannot sustain a dissident point of view in the face of a 
school system that teaches liberal nonsense. Orthodox Jews have always 
understood this, and because their schools are religious they have built
 private schools to sustain their way of life. </p>
        <p> Private schools for whites are desirable but not necessary. 
Setting one up is a big job, and with enough people in a community, it 
would be easier and cheaper to elect a school board, and revamp the 
public schools. American schools teach the same subjects they did 50 
years ago. It is the emphasis that has shifted, and there is no reason 
why a racially-conscious school could not shift the emphasis back. A 
curriculum taken unchanged from 50 years ago probably would be, except 
for a few odds and ends like sex education, in compliance with current 
standards. If state regulations demanded teaching units on American 
Indians, the slave trade, or American multiculturalism, these subjects 
could certainly be taught   &mdash;   though from a more traditional point of 
view. In fact, it would be important to cover those subjects thoroughly 
whether they were required or not. Any child who went to college after 
an education of this kind might be in for a shock, but by that age 
healthy ideas would probably be unassailable. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> There are now more than enough racially aware whites to move
 gradually into a small town and remake its institutions. These whites 
would not have to be a majority in order to elect town councilmen or 
school board members. An activist minority can achieve a great deal, and
 any largely white town would have a certain number of original 
inhabitants who would support a return to good sense. </p>
        <p> The question, of course, is where whites should go. Moving 
is a great bother, and everyone can think of reasons why the best place 
for a white community is the place where he already lives. Some obvious 
criteria are that if an existing town is to be taken over, it should be 
small, already overwhelmingly white, and with its own small school 
district. If a school is part of a huge, county-wide school district, 
for example, it could not be returned to sanity without taking over the 
entire district   &mdash;   an extremely difficult undertaking. </p>
        <p> After people move, they have to make a living. It would be 
important to choose a town not far from a metropolitan area with jobs. 
When the Orthodox congregations built new towns, they arranged for 
private commuter buses into New York City so people could support 
themselves. It would be good to attract a certain number of retired 
people whose pension or Social Security income would follow them 
wherever they moved. A retirement home in a white town would be 
attractive to older people who prefer to be looked after by people from 
the community rather than by black and Puerto Rican orderlies. </p>

        <p> Some would fear that the government would make it impossible
 to run a white town, but I disagree. Sooner or later it would become 
clear what was happening, but no laws <i>require</i> residential 
integration, and the country is still largely segregated. As soon as a 
town had a reputation for white consciousness, no non-whites would want 
to live there. If a few insisted on moving in as test cases, they would 
have to be let in; there could be no outright discrimination. However, 
no one wants to spend his life as a test case. Such people would move in
 with great fanfare, but would soon move out. If a certain number of 
non-whites decided to stay, they would have to be tolerated. Very few 
would choose that kind of life, and a handful of odd-balls would be a 
small price to pay for a healthy-minded community. The town would have 
to be very careful never to break anti-discrimination laws, but 
practically everything necessary for a real white community can be 
achieved entirely within the law. </p>

        <p> Some might argue that starting small in this way is a 
renunciation of the larger, national goals of a white consciousness 
movement. On the contrary, it could well be that only modest beginnings 
can lead to greater achievements. A successful white community would 
grow. It could become the nucleus for a region that would send 
representatives to the state house and to Washington. The region would 
not only have a political voice, it would inspire imitators. </p>
        <p> In the Feb. 1995 issue of AR there was a debate about 
whether the United States could be saved as a unitary, white state or 
whether whites would have to accept partition if they are to gain a 
homeland. This was an interesting but entirely abstract debate that does
 nothing to solve the problems we face every day. White communities are 
compatible with either approach   &mdash;   partition or unitary state   &mdash;   and have 
the immeasurable advantage of large benefits now. Small gatherings of 
whites will not immediately change the government in Washington or 
detoxify the national media, but they would be the beginnings of a real,
 practical movement to save our race and culture. Let us begin to 
cultivate our corners of the world even as we work to change it.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" width="11" height="11" /> </p>

		<p>I have to say I couldn&rsquo;t disagree more with this article.</p>
<p>I see the world as rapidly being forced to come to grips with the reality of what is discussed on Amren, and the harsh consequences of pretending things are otherwise.</p>
<p>I see the primary problem as being institutionally enforced ignorance.  An all encompassing control of media, news, and communication that prevents widespread dissemination of a tsunami of anti-white violence.  People know about incidents local to them but are unaware that such things are not isolated incidents.  The racist pattern of the violence is being covered up.  But, and this is very important, that coverup is taking more and more time, effort, energy and money.  The system by which it is covered up is in danger of breaking down.  For MANY, it has broken down and these people have learned the truth.  That knowledge permanently changes their behavior and belief system.</p>
<p>Most people are brainwashed but such brainwashing is only a veneer.  Exposed to the truth, it tears like cotton cloth.  The result is rage, and a righteous desire to protect ones loved ones from this.</p>
<p>The primary job for a group like Amren should be destroying the coverup.  It&rsquo;s not enough to talk in general terms.  What needs to be created is an alternative news media that is more popular than the current mainstream, that focuses on exposing what is going on.</p>
<p>A good template is the News section of Stormfront.  Millions of people read the boards of Stormfront, everyday to learn the news items the mainstream media does not provide them.  This is effective but limited in scope.</p>
<p>What is needed is something more of the scope of Yahoo news.  With in depth, professional articles by a large group of reporters that collect, collate and present news from all over the US and all over the world, in such a way as to make the racist pattern of anti-white behavior extremely obvious.</p>
<p>Make it of quality and, eventually, it will become the primary source by which most people obtain their news.</p>
<p>Then things will change.</p>
<p>The world is no longer a place where you can build isolated communities and live the way you want separated from others.  There is the world we live in and no other.  And any attempt at separation will, at best, be quickly thwarted.  At worst, well, Ruby Ridge, comes to mind.</p>
<p>What we can do, is destroy the lies by which the community we have no choice but to belong to, is controlled.  That can and should be done.</p>
<p>There are many other things that can be done, but this is the safest, most directly effective, monetarily efficient thing.</p>
<p>The truth shall set you free.</p>

see Maine, Minnesota, rural Tennessee, etc.<br>
There is also a US government push to send blacks out to suburbs, this has been going on for at least 15 years and has wreaked much havoc in formerly safe communities.</p>

		<p>Integration leads to corruption. The leftists are right when they say our institutions, and our way of life must change in order to accommodate diversity. Whites need separation and autonomy. I know AmRen is not a racial separatist organisation, perhaps it&rsquo;s a position AmRen cannot take, but we need separation. I suspect the majority of whites, even those on the left, suspect that this is true.</p>

		<p>I hope that AR will let this go through as I need your help in accomplishing a positive goal that fits this point very well.<br>
I need help form those that can design flags.  I also need help in encouraging our leaders to work together h o support the implementation of the following task.  <br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
Here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Over the last several months I have been sending a small note out to many of the leaders of the pro-white groups.  I have been trying to encourage all of our people to get behind the creation of a new flag that can be flown by pro-white groups and individuals all over the world.  This flag would be a sign of their pro-white sentiments and the interconnected nature of our race, as well as the growing power of our movement worldwide.  <br>
The note that I sent out to everyone follows:</p>
<p>I thought that I should bring up once again the idea of what we might call a visual mantra (referring to Bob&rsquo;s Mantra) actually a flag or symbol. </p>
<p>We white people need a flag/symbol that represents our loyalty to our race and its needs. The flag needs to be newly designed and not tied to any particular group, country or political idea. </p>
<p>It must be attractive and accepted by all loyal whites through out the world. All pro-white groups here and in Europe will need to agree to its use so that it may be displayed and recognized by everyone. </p>
<p>Other flags such as the Nazi flag or the Confederate flag cannot be used in this case. We desperately need a new flag / symbol. I very much hope that the leaders of our cause can get to work on this project and that we can accomplish this SOON. </p>
<p>The time has arrived for an effort to be made in the creation of this flag.  What I need at this time is to start collecting ideas and designs for this flag.  Here are a few ground rules for the flag:</p>
<p> The flag cannot resemble the flag of any other state, political group, nation, military unit, business or other organization.  </p>
<p> The flag needs to be a simple, easy to recognize design and be symmetrical to a degree.  </p>
<p> The design should not contain any phrases, images of animals or people.  There is a bit of leeway on this but not much.</p>
<p> The elements of the design should not be overly complicated or impossible to recognize when displayed on the reverse of the flag (for this reason lettering is considered in bad taste).  </p>
<p> Traditional or avant garde symbols should be recognizable. </p>
<p>For a bit of help in understanding the nature of flag design here is a web site that you can use.<br>
https://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/designs/vexigrap.html</p>
<p>I know that this project will take a lot of work and effort to accomplish but I know that we can get this done and the time is most certainly right for it, so let&rsquo;s get started.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to do:<br>
Send your designs to epistemology@bellsouth.net.<br>
Talk this up among your friends and the leaders of our movement. <br>
Help to create a spirit of anticipation and acceptance of this effort.  </p>
<p>Thank you ever so much,<br>
Conrad<br>
If you have an idea or suggestion send it to<br>
epistemology@bellsouth.net<br>

		<p>    There&rsquo;s a lot of good in this article however,someone- somehow,someway is going to have to make a stand against our government or governments . Because our Federal government and a lot of our state governments are not going to let some of these ideas go unchallenged . Look at the way they are already challenging the Tea Party movement . Not to mention a lot of special interest groups who are not going to sit back and let conservatives establish communities based on conservative thought.This fight is already going on and has been since the end of WW2 . Infiltration and indoctrination is the lefts method of operation and they are not going to give it up . They want to get their hands on your children . A lot of the 1960s civil rights leaders said that up front . Lawyers, we need armies of them . We need to start changing laws first . Then perhaps, conservative communities can exist and grow . Use the lefts methods of activism and litigation against them . Make it so troubling and expensive for them to try and enforce or force their ideas on the rest of us that they will think twice the next time . Do a case study of say, the civil rights movement and just what made it so sucessful and follow suit . Use hedge schools to bring about the emergence of white pride in our children . Then train them in the arts of political activism and litigation as a solemn duty to help their own kind . As for a flag, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say or how to begin . Celtic and Viking symbols have already come under attack from the left .     </p>

		<p>In his book &#8220;How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years,&#8221; which was published in 1979, Howard J. Ruff predicted an inflationary depression. He said that the stock market would crash, banks would fail, and warned, &#8220;I would not want to live within ten miles of Harlem when the welfare checks bounce.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
He advised affluent whites to sell their stocks, withdraw their money from banks, buy gold, and move to predominately white parts of the country: presumably mid western and mountain states.  <br>
 <br>
In retrospect, we can see that he should have advised his readers to move to multi racial, multi ethnic San Francisco, buy old houses, and fix them up. After 1979 the price of gold and the crime rate declined.  The the value of stocks and housing in San Francisco multiplied.  <br>
 <br>
It also would have been a good idea to move within ten miles of Harlem.  Housing in New York city also multiplied in value.  New York has become the fourth safest large city.<br>

		<p>There are plenty of small towns and rural communities that are all white or mostly white, and the values therein are usually in keeping with the population.  <br>
Children should be taught to be proud of their own family and the ethnic group(s) to which their ancestors belonged.  On a regular basis, their own culture should be lauded, and by-the-numbers facts concerning race-realism should be presented when they are old enough to absorb them.  Platitudes don&rsquo;t always work, but hard-fact reasons usually do.</p>

<p>No. How can you have a White community or nation when one allows nonwhites among their midst?  You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is about building WHITE communities, (and IMO, White nations) not about IQ or if one is a liberal or not.</p>
<p>This is how it all started in the first place with arguments such as yours. Some people fell for it. Then the floodgates opened and that is why we are where we are now. Fool me once, but fool me twice&hellip;..comes to mind.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you come from but most none-whites have already areas for themselves. In Iraq there we have some areas a black guy would never be able to get in. And others even Iraqis can just get in for guest but not live there.</p>
<p>In onther parts of the world there is a natural separation buy money. The rich and productive one can live somewhere and the other can&rsquo;t and for safety reasons the rich one make fences around their community   &mdash;    &mdash;  &gt; There the normal seperation is.</p>
<p>But in white countries liberals are making housing projects and communities are not allowed to make fences around themselves so frequently the low IQ get into the areas of the high IQ people.</p>

		<p>You can not expect your children to be conservative if you give them to the public school system. Identify an area or areas and start encouraging people to move there so that they can become the majority or bigger majority. Also then start private schools where the correct things are taught.It is impossible to have the whole US, rather accept a smaller portion and be governed by your own people. Spreaded out all over the US you wll be in a minority in a few years and be governed by the new majority.</p>

		<p>Well, while I would love to simply carve out my own little corner of the world where racially conscious whites could settle and live free of the other races, the simple fact is that the rest of the world won&rsquo;t disappear just because we ignore it. The second an all-white community gets settled, it will become a magnet for non-whites seeking to live in a more prosperous, stable society. Of course, in the process of immigrating, they will destroy the very qualities of the community that attracted them to it. The only way to safeguard such a society would be to actively keep out non-whites. Unfortunately, such a policy is likely to lead to conflict with the outsiders, and with a nonwhite-dominated US government. Thus, we must focus on national politics, if we are to secure our people&rsquo;s future.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see why both the large scale and the small scale visions could not be combined and indeed, if you think we are going to end up partioned like 1940s Palestine, the micro had better become macroable or you are in a bad way, genetically, as a function of finding work and mates outside a very tiny closed community.</p>
<p>If you visit the wiki Orania page-</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orania,_Northern_Cape" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orania,_Northern_Cape</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that they have community driven goals like lowering reliance on electricity and emphasizing low pollution/recycling as environmental conservancy goals not just in their own right but also to avoid &#8216;being governed by other than Afrikaaners&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Yet they also have tourism and hotel/caravan (camper) areas specifically to encourage some external influx of currency to supplement an internal &#8216;voucher&rsquo; system which sounds a lot like socialism.</p>
<p>U.S. White Communities -could- do something similar, but it would have to happen within zoning and national parkland type restraints.</p>
<p>In addition Oranians also offer plans for what they call an &#8216;Aardskepe&rsquo; or &#8216;Earth Ship&rsquo; which is the essence of a modular, expandable, low cost and high efficiency, home design built with very few exotic materials.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/24oslkq" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/24oslkq</a></p>
<p>I think that such a system of -community- engineering, using agreed to standards that require high concentrations of internal, manual, labor &#8216;by for and of the residents&rsquo; could be an easy way to create internal conditions that would only be amenable and supportive to those of chosen association.</p>
<p>Buy the plans?  No, we give them to you if you are part of the association.  Expand your &#8216;nest&rsquo; when you become a couple and then a family?  Sure!  Be right over.  Own the stock?  Yes, if we agree to sell you what amounts to land use rights (yes, Orania is a company, wholely owned by it&rsquo;s residents).</p>
<p>That type of thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t prevent the enemy, Big Fed, from chock a block &#8216;settling&rsquo; massive numbers of unwanted ethnies in or near your chosen zone community habitat safe zone.  As the Somalis in Michigan and New England illustrate.</p>
<p>So you can only achieve this in a society where the majority are sufficiently interested in sustaining YOUR independence that they go to bat for you in demanding basic assurances of individual rights of ownership and association &#8216;in surrounding areas&rsquo; that guarantee your sanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately unlikely that those kinds of go-getter activists are of a pscyhological mindset to live the quiet lifestyle of a rural community.  While it&rsquo;s equally unlikely that that lifestyle would remain without upset if it was surrounded by the kinds of people who form an &#8216;urban majority&rsquo; sufficient to gain noteable representation in Congress.</p>
<p>In this it&rsquo;s important to note that Orania is off in the boondocks of the arid South African bushvelde.  And even there, as soon as they settled in, 60 colored families tried to follow on their heels on the assumption that &#8216;they had only left so a canal could be built&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the U.S., such availability of open space is basically zero.</p>
<p>Small Community Idealism is therefore untenable unless you have an external standard of governing which does not reflect mob rule as &#8216;majority by district occupation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t run out and buy a bunch of gold and hope that will keep you safe in an economic cataclysm.  You can&rsquo;t east gold, you can&rsquo;t burn it for fuel, or convert it to anything useful. Gold is only useful when an economy based on trading exists.  Even then, in the most primitive ones, salt is the most valuable mineral.  Apart from that, those who have the best weapons and know how to use them survive and dominate.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the old Twilight Zone episode when a few thieves used artificial hybernation to enable a gold heist to succeed.  The only problem was that gold no longer had any value when they awoke one hundred years later.  They couldn&rsquo;t even trade it for water.</p>
<p>Then we have the example of the California Gold Rush, the Alaskan Gold Rush, etc.  The simplist commodities like eggs were sky high, and any luxury, including women, were likewise ridiculously expensive.  In his &#8220;The Luck of Roaring Camp,&#8221; Bret Harte wrote about how men paid money just to see a baby.  I just laugh at those guys like Gordon Libby  in those tv commercials.</p>

		<p>A flag is the least useful thing we need right now.  Flags are actually symbols or signs for identification in battle, just as uniforms are.  Other than that, they represent religious identities.  Unless we are in an actual battle flags don&rsquo;t do us much good, except to give our enemies a fix on us.  No, we are more in the time of secret handshakes and codewords.  If and when the time comes for fighting we will know who is who fairly quickly, and some old symbols may serve just fine.</p>

		<p>I saw a program on The History Channel or some such a while back that supposed a future breakdown of central government, economy, etc.  A family from San Diego, I think, fled north.  Some of the communities they found along their way, illustrated that Amereners aren&rsquo;t the only ones thinking about what people will do and what they are talking about now.  The problem I see is that Americans, especially white Americans, are very individualistic and don&rsquo;t like being told what to do, yet many have leadership fantasies.  I think it could be like a feudal state in their beginnings with one group at another&rsquo;s throat.  Communities like Amish, etc., have over a hundred years of practice and they only remained who they were, they did not try to revert back to something.  My observation is that nearly every Christian I have ever met has a different interpretation of what it means to them and what their real limits or duties are, and I have met them world wide.  So unless we can donsciously make our basis one of tolerance toward our own in matters of conscience, and not reject knowledge in trade for superstition, it might succeed.  But the real test comes when you actually get what you want.  </p>

<p>Yes, and moving into existing areas such as those would be far better.  I hate to be pessimistic but gathering up groups of White Nationalists and trying to create some sort of &#8220;utopian&#8221; society could turn weird really fast. It could be another Waco in the making.</p>
<p>Bottom line is White National Activitists are a bit on the fringe and a concentrated group of fringe personalities isolated amongst themselves is not a good thing (I am not judging, I myself am rather eccentric in some ways). </p>

		<p>I take Rajesh&rsquo;s point about Asian neighbours, but the answer has to be that they could not properly find a place in a white community town. As in the case of orthodox Jews, it has to be our own thing, preserving and protecting our own identity and for that 90% homogeneity is necessary. There is no reason why, for example, Punjabi Sikhs or Chinese should not have their own exclusive communities and I&rsquo;m sure that they would be pleasant places in which to live - but not for white people.   </p>

		<p>There are a lot of small towns in America that are presently all White. There are plenty of little rural burgs that have never had a Black walk down any of their streets. </p>
<p>Some of them are that way purely because of luck. Others have 100% white populations by design. I know of several all White communities in Georgia that are within a stones-throw of very dark Macon. Those communities stay all White because the residents are all on the same page. In those communities homes are rented and sold exclusively by word of mouth. In addition to that, those who are allowed to lead those communities do not ask the federal government for the grants and gifts that always come with strings attached. That way they don&rsquo;t attract the attention of the social engineers.</p>
<p>I live in an all White town in KY. Population 1600. There are a few Blacks, maybe 20, in our county, but they keep to themselves out in the country. They don&rsquo;t want to put out the welcome mat for more Blacks any more than we Whites do, so we don&rsquo;t have any racial problems at the present time.</p>
<p>I would recommend that anyone who wants to get away should look into towns that haven&rsquo;t been contaminated by diversity. Then, when you find one, tell your new White neighbors every Black-inspired horror story you know. Many of them will have been insulated from city madness to such a degree that they might actually be buying the drivel about downtrodden Blacks that the progressive media has been putting on television for decades.</p>
<p>White retirees, especially, should take a serious look at the many safe, all White, rural towns in Kansas. Homes are bargain-priced in such areas and the cost of living is far lower than the national average, so those fixed income dollars will stretch a lot farther. A few years ago I bought a large 107 year old limestone house on 19 acres way out in the country in African-free Mitchell County, KS. The house has electricity, high speed internet and cable TV already wired in. My property taxes are around $150 dollars a year. Buys like this are easy to find out there in Matt Dillon country.</p>

		<p>One area where white traditionalists and nationalists are conspiciously inactive is at the college level, which is where the left got started in the first place.</p>
<p>There are lots of web sites and blogs promoting white interests but nothing which allows young people to meet up and discuss issues and take action. This is particularly important in a country like the U.S where the political system discourages the emergence of alternative right wing parties of the type seen in Europe. About the only organisation which seems to be addressing this gap is Youth for Western Civilization, I hope these guys do well, and establish chapters in other western countries.</p>

<p>South Asians, as you delicately call them, are a broad and widely varied group who come in many races, colors, and cultures. Many of them have nothing in common but geography.

<p>Perhaps &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; would be the better word here, as there is so much confusion about terminology. That&rsquo;s one of our problems: imprecise terminology.

You forgot Jews. There are several people on this site who don&rsquo;t think that ethnic Jews are White. I personally never met a Jew who wasn&rsquo;t White. Sammy Davis was neither Sephardi nor Ashkenazi nor is Yaphet Koto. The difference is obvious. </p>

		<p>Jared has blinders on. If we do  follow St Paul`s admonition,&#8221; Be ye seperate.&#8221;most moving into such places will be top producers. The riff raff trash will not abide having their prey and cash cows live without fear and therefore not keep bribing the trash to not rape and kill them. I can see embattled enclaves decorating their borders with Stalag 17 like fences. The rulers will not allow free whites who refuse to knuckle under to the masses who vote in the rulers to exist. They will do what they did in Waco to the Branch Dravidians who had done nothing but tell the government to kiss off. Rather than gather in utopian hideaways, the few remaining whites with morals, should arm themselves to the teeth and protect their own homes. If more and more whites turn their homes into fortresses, the minority trash will have less grazing ground and will be forced to ambush folks on the streets. Going armed in small groups to the store or doctor`s offices will empower the Scots-Irish descendants of Highland warriors to feel like freemen and not cowering slaves to low IQ criminals and race baiters.<br>

		<p>Rajesh, it&rsquo;s very simple: white people who WANT to live with you should have the right to do so, and vice versa - East Asians (or whoever) who want to live with whites who WANT them around, should be able to do so.<br>
The problem is that more than 95% of whites do not want to live around other races, which is why it had to be forced onto us - i.e. by tyranny. We know that most whites want to live only with other whites by looking at their house buying choices - more than 95% of whites won&rsquo;t buy houses in &#8216;diverse&rsquo; areas, which is how they became &#8216;diverse&rsquo; (i.e. more non-white) in the first place.<br>
Nobody has the right to force themselves into the company of anybody else on earth.</p>

<p><br>
Good luck to them.   But it&rsquo;s predictable that eventually the government will get around to them. Politicians like Obama and Holder will not rest content with communities like that out there.  Somehow, some way, some means will be found to put the pressure on them. Little by little, nibble by nibble, the screw will be turned.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised to find a community of several thousand Somalis re-settled there, or next door. Just for example. Towns in Maine and Minnesota could have said that they were all white just ten years ago. Not now.</p>
<p>The government obviously can&rsquo;t do everything at once, but as has been said here many times before, in the long run not a single white community will be allowed to exist. That is the future we are facing. </p>
<p>We are like passengers on the Titanic, running from one part of the deck to another, to escape the rising water. The real problem is not our location on the deck;  the problem is that the ship is sinking.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to run stats on 90% plus white communities and keep a record of how long they are remaining so.  A retrospective set of studies would be interesting as well.  I do know that the NAACP has been picking out towns with colleges, industry, etc., and pressured its mayors, civic leaders, etc., to open up to blacks and others. It happened here nad we now have 1,000% more crime than ten years ago.  (Just my estimate).  I am guessing that the communities you speak of have little employment opportunities, no colleges, older populations?  So planning a future from essentially retirement communities while providing some measure of safety for the elderly (and hopefully adequate healthcare services) will not really project foward into a white future.  Just imagine welcoming young white computer nerds, looking at green energy, forward looking self-sustaining family farming methods, etc.  Most posters here would brand them &#8220;communists&#8221; and drive them out, because there is still a civil war going on between whites who want to progress and may want to save the white race, and whites who don&rsquo;t want to hear about anything except John Deer tractor races and Church.  </p>
<p>We have gulfs to cross within a white movement that would be likely to succeed.  But my wife and I are trying to do our part.  We choose our friends carefully, and we keep a garden, can, and also some chickens on our quarter acre suburban home plot.  We have loose links to our white neighbors, and we are all in agreement on some &#8220;basics.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is an important question that strikes right to the heart of white nationalism and race.</p>
<p>For most of human history, races have been allowed to naturally coexist and maintain their own racial identity based on little more than choice of mate and respect (or lack of respect) for various forms of boundaries.</p>
<p>The amount of tolerance based on the quality of each others genes and the willingness to respect one anothers lives, property etc.</p>
<p>Smart, hard working, enlightened people have always been able to peacefully coexist both with and without a certain level of blood ties (limited inter-marriage).  Bad people are simply not allowed near good people.  One or the other always initiated war, that is usually genocidal in outcome.</p>
<p>The problem is, today, forced integration, especially with those with the very worst genes.  Literally, biological warfare and genocide using the pathology of groups of people to destroy others is being waged against whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this problem that separation is put forth as a solution for.  Some would argue that, of course, there is always room for good people.  Others would argue that unless stiff, unwavering resistance is put up, whites will disappear as a race and civilization, at least free civilization could disappear with us.  Whites are what keep the majority of the world from being ruled by ironfisted despots who would keep almost everyone enslaved and impoverished.  But, there is good reason to suspect that the world could return to a stone age existence, without us.  This is a serious issue with existential as well as practical implications.</p>
<p>Personally, I would argue that separation is pointless.  The real issue here is someone is making war on us.  Unless we confront and destroy them, or at least mobilize the majority of whites to resist, any separation will quickly lead to war and extermination&hellip;.assuming separation is successful&hellip;.which is unlikely.</p>
<p>Once white people move beyond brainwashing at least to the point where it is no longer taboo to specifically identify those responsible and specifically identify what they are doing and why it is genocide, then the problem can be dealt with directly.</p>
<p>Once it is dealt with, either through war, or more likely through forced expulsion of those attacking us, everyone, of every race, can get back to living our lives and minding our own business, as we have for thousands of years.<br>

You forgot Jews. There are several people on this site who don&rsquo;t think that ethnic Jews are White. </i></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t forget them. I carefully omitted them, as I am aware that there is controversy over that here, and I don&rsquo;t want to get into that. (Amren doesn&rsquo;t want to either.)  I have known some Jews who were extremely white (meaning fair-skinned) but they were exceptions rather than the norm.  (As Sammy Davis was an exception; but he was a  religious convert anyway, not  a Jew by descent,  not a genetic Jew.   He&rsquo;s not a good example to use, as we&rsquo;re not talking about religion but ethnicity.)   </p>
<p>Anyhow, the question was about South and East Asians, not Jews. I suppose Jews (most of them) would count as West Asians, as best one could define them.  That refers to them <i>as a group</i>;  but a great many of them, as individuals,  are preponderantly European without a doubt.  Given their long history in so many countries, they are so mixed that it&rsquo;s hard to pin them down to anything specific.  There are many varying types, but  at the core there is  still a &#8220;typical&#8221; type. The others are exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p><i>Please show these Afghans, etc. that are &ldquo;white&rdquo;. Because they may have light skin they are &ldquo;white&rdquo;? Do you mean they may have SOME white blood in them? </i></p>
<p>What OTHER blood do they have?  Please tell what other race could they be included in?   I said that I, just personally, consider them to be white, for the most part.   And I added &#8220;generally speaking&#8221;.  But I acknowledged that there is disagreement about this, and so perhaps &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; would be a more encompassing term.  That&rsquo;s fine with me.  Carlton Coon included most of India as Caucasian, dark Caucasians.  I agree with Coon. </p>
<p>In the five major races of mankind, where would YOU put them?   You are proving my assertion that we are in great  need of more precise terminology.   We can&rsquo;t discuss anything if we can&rsquo;t agree on the meaning of our terms. </p>

		<p>I think the flag idea is brilliant. If a good campaign is used we could introduce many whites to our movement. There&rsquo;s creativity involved. Some drama over which flag will win. A flag is a way of branding ourselves as whites. Think of how all countries have flags and anthems.  What about corporate logos? A brand is a promise so we are creating the means to distinguish whites from others. </p>

<p>I have known Iranians and Afghans that were as white as many Italians. Culturally they are very gracious in an old world European way. Grant it marrying them might not produce blue eyed babies but having them as neighbors and school mates to the kids would not be detrimental in any way. Indians and Pakistani&rsquo;s are in my mind both racially and culturally too different imo, the men frequently look down on white women which I find personally offensive.</p>

They would be welcome in my community, regardless of political affiliation.  I saw what impoverished Vietnamese war refugees did to San Jose, California during the 1980s.  When I moved to downtown San Jose in December 1977 the area was horribly blighted.  Every night looked like Halloween night.  Unfortunately, the scary people walking down the street were not wearing costumes.  That was the way they really looked.  <br>
 <br>
Whenever I told people I lived in &#8220;downtown San Jose,&#8221; they shuddered.<br>
 <br>
Well, the Vietnamese moved in, took any job they could find, and lived anywhere they could.  Most were destitute. The few who had a little money and business knowledge opened Vietnamese restaurants, gift shops, and grocery stores.   <br>
 <br>
Vietnamese teenagers stayed out of trouble.  Whenever I went to a public library it was full of them doing their homework. Many of those teenagers are currently earning big incomes as professionals and managers.  No one gave that to them.  They earned it.<br>
 <br>
Now San Jose has the lowest crime rate of any large American city.<br>

An assertion like that should be documented with a public opinion survey.  I doubt it is 95%.  Why do so many brilliant young whites with educations from the best universities in the United States move to multi ethnic cities like San Francisco and New York?  <br>
                  <br>
The only minority I do not want to live with is the one I unfortunately do live with.  I do not object to their dark skin.  I object to their high crime.  There is a difference between race realism and race bigotry.  </p>

		<p>To Anon #1: The concerns you have about any Media not addressing the anti-White Racism which is so rampant to all readers here at AmRen is noted, but I must tell you that there are other web sites that contribute to the education of diluted Whites, much the way Stormfront, American Renaissance, and the Council of Conservative Citizens does.</p>
<p>The other web sites that do address these horrendous crimes that are ignored by the Liberal Media are New Nation News at www.newnationnews.com, News With Views at www.newswithviews.com, VDARE at www.vdare.com, Devvy Kidd at www.devvykidd.com, Conservatives for Education Reform, Family Security Matters at www.familysecuirtymatters.com, Peoples Education at www.peopleseducation.org, National Vanguard at www.nationalvanguard.org, National Coalition at www.nationalcoalition.org, Neighborhood 21 at www.neighborhood21.com, Occidental Observer at www.occidentalobserver.net, The American Conservative at www.amconmag.com, The Occidental Quarterly at www.theoccidentalquarterly.com, and Youth for Western Civilization, among so many others. </p>
<p>There needs to be a link between these various groups to cooperate together, and field Candidates for local, State, and Federal Offices, during Elections. </p>
<p>Some of the most important Elections take place within your own Communities, such as for School Board, and Village Justice, Village Mayor, Justice of the Peace, Fire Commissioner, Library Board, etc.. Let&rsquo;s not overlook County Clerk and Sheriff. </p>
<p>If you want to affect change immediately, start working on getting Candidates that speak to the majority of people in your areas, to get elected to these Offices. No Elected or Appointed Office is too great or small to go for. </p>
<p>As far as the Author&rsquo;s concern about non-Whites moving in to the new White enclaves, it is fairly easy to sidestep, by doing what people should have been doing all along, which is Not Using Real Estate Brokers/Agents. Once the house or property is listed, it is fair game for all. </p>
<p>However, if the property is sold privately, to other family members, friends, etc., then it never has to be listed. </p>
<p>If the property is not something that family and friends want directly, then use your memberships in your Fraternal Organizations, Sports groups, etc., to let certain people know that the property may be going up for sale. </p>

<p>have known Iranians and Afghans that were as white as many Italians. Culturally they are very gracious in an old world European way. Grant it marrying them might not produce blue eyed babies but having them as neighbors and school mates to the kids would not be detrimental in any way. Indians and Pakistani&rsquo;s are in my mind both racially and culturally too different imo, the men frequently look down on white women which I find personally offensive.<br>

<p>Are they of the White race, Sonya? I don&rsquo;t care how white their SKIN is. This whole article is about building White communities, not somewhat White communities. You may know some Iranians and Afghans and believe they are not detrimental in any way to the White race in America, but I beg to differ. I have also known many Iranians and met a few Afghans and I have a different view of them than you do.</p>
<p>I have noticed far too many on this site seem to pick and choose which nonwhite is a-okay to live among us. I don&rsquo;t want any to live among us. This is how slippery slopes get started, folks. First one group then another group and then pretty soon you have all groups and multiplying at alarming rates!</p>

		<p>The problem is that more than 95% of whites do not want to live around other races.</p>
<p>If it came down to brass tacks, that might be true, but as it is,  you have a large segment of white people, commonly referred to as liberals, who want others to live with coloreds of all varieties.  I know people who would be so thrilled to have colored grandchildren.  Much more so than &#8220;mere&#8221; white.  If my former best friend&rsquo;s daughter would have married a white I would have been astonished beyond words. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only representing my own opinion but I would NOT be happy with East Asians or South Asians living in such a community.</p>
<p>Nothing disrespectful against who you are as a people but throughout the Western world, East Asians, South Asians, blacks, and Latinos are free to form cohesive communities and groups that are explicitly ethnic.  Only Whites are not.  Such a community would be roundly condemned as&hellip; well, you certainly know the answer to this!</p>

		<p>A few thoughts about gold.</p>
<p>Since the subject has been broached and since we now confront the issue of preserving our racial heritage - a process whose success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to defend our rightfully earned wealth and our property from usurpation by collectivist entities - we should be careful not to discount gold&rsquo;s economic and philosophic significance.</p>
<p>Over thousands of years in cultures throughout the world, gold and its humble cousin silver have always emerged naturally as currencies of choice for a number of reasons, the most important of which, arguably, is that governments and central banks cannot arbitrarily and instantly increase its supply through excessive issuance and fractional reserve lending.</p>
<p>Gold is fungible, highly inert, divisible, durable, easily and universally recognized, and impossible to counterfeit.Using other metals such as tungsten overlaid with gold, fake coins and bars can be made, but with much difficulty and expense.</p>
<p>Gold is an honest medium of exchange, functions very well during dangerous economic times as a stable store of purchasing power, and enables working folks who produce actual wealth or provide valuable services to safeguard their savings from stealth taxation, wealth redistribution, and other machinations of the the fraudulent, debt-based, fiat central banking matrix.</p>
<p>Every fiat dollar enters its unholy existence as debt to be repaid with interest by someone - almost always a taxpayer - to the central bank. Gold, on the other hand, is the only major monetary asset that is not some one else&rsquo;s liability. </p>
<p>For the more modest among us, silver also works quite well for this purpose, though it requires more storage space. In fact, it tends at the end of the market day, so to speak, to outperform gold. </p>
<p>To argue against gold on the basis of its inedibility does not aid this discussion. What can be more inedible than intrinsically worthless paper saturated with toxic ink, or for that matter, mere electronic impulses in computer data bases.</p>
<p>Finally, to allude to a Twilight Zone story which presupposes that gold will become valueless in 100 years or so is to counter economic sanity and the historical record.</p>
<p>That said, I do agree wholeheartedly that food, shelter, clothing, tools, weapons, and other supplies essential to the survival of kith and kin during a crisis should be procured first. But by all means one should convert the bulk of one&rsquo;s surplus paper cash to silver - and, if affordable, some gold as well - physically secured, not in a bank safe deposit box, but where he, and only he or someone trustworthy, can access it.     <br>

		<p>&#8220;I do not object to their dark skin. I object to their high crime. There is a difference between race realism and race bigotry. &#8220;</p>
<p>By this definition I&rsquo;m a bigot.  I don&rsquo;t like seeing black models in ads or black faces all over my community regardless of how they behave.  I like to see white faces in white places.  </p>

		<p>These days, the only way to live in a non-ethnic oriented town is to find one way out of the metro areas where there&rsquo;s not lots of commercial farming (latinos) and no large govt. employers (bring in blacks). The real estate has to be pricy (unless the community can demo. that outsiders are not welcome). </p>
<p>Just remember, the minority groups want to live where whites live. If these special minorities are given a big welcome,their population will increase. Whites should be intolerant just like the darkies are.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;An assertion like that should be documented with a public opinion survey. I doubt it is 95%. Why do so many brilliant young whites with educations from the best universities in the United States move to multi ethnic cities like San Francisco and New York? &#8220;</p>
<p>Do you think that may have something to do with employment opportunities more than it might have to do with the tyoes of the people who live there?</p>
<p>Putnam&rsquo;s research found the same deleterious effects on interpersonal trust and social cohesion in those highly multiracial, &#8220;educated&#8221; cities as it did everywhere else.</p>

		<p>Good grief, this is so defeatable! We had white communities, which were all busted up in the 60&rsquo;s.  I remember reading in mainstream mags back in the 70&rsquo;s how Vietnamese were being settled in small places in Iowa and such, so as to avoid the sort of &#8220;reaction&#8221; that comes from suddenly millions of aliens appearing some place like the Puerta Ricans in New York did as in West Side Story), etc.  I thought then how insidious it was for our government to do this, to keep it a secret how many were being brought in, as though it was none of our business.  </p>
<p>The obvious tactic to destroy any such community is precisely what they do now, just bring in thousands of Somalis or the like and settle them right there in your &#8220;white community.&#8221;  The federal government would buy the property and pay all expenses (out of your tax dollars) to accomplish this.  They have unlimited resources (yours) to do this, and it&rsquo;s really all they care about anyway; so, why not?  </p>
<p>To win, we&rsquo;ll have to break &#8220;the law.&#8221;  Eventually our enemies WILL resort to anti-hate speech laws and ass-holes will go around with recording devices to practice entrapment of people who SAY anything pro-White.  It&rsquo;s essentially the same tactic used in the 60&rsquo;s &#8220;block busting,&#8221; which still goes on, some making a living off trying to get whites refusing to rent or sell to them.  </p>
<p>Thousands will have to turn out regularly to BATTLE the police and military to build such communities, the ones we used to have, the ones we failed to defend then.  But, there&rsquo;s still some hope this will happen, because people are now being pushed against the wall, no escape to suburbia, no jobs to protect, no just protecting one more generation; that&rsquo;s over.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;White retirees, especially, should take a serious look at the many safe, all White, rural towns in Kansas. Homes are bargain-priced in such areas and the cost of living is far lower than the national average, so those fixed income dollars will stretch a lot farther. A few years ago I bought a large 107 year old limestone house on 19 acres way out in the country in African-free Mitchell County, KS. The house has electricity, high speed internet and cable TV already wired in. My property taxes are around $150 dollars a year. Buys like this are easy to find out there in Matt Dillon country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where is that in relation to Wichita? We all remember what happened THERE a few years ago.<br>
