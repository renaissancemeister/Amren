<h1>Curtis Got Slapped: Mother Claims Teacher Slapped Son, Writes 40 Crazed Pages Of Demands</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mandy Oaklander, The Pitch, Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When a child named Curtis Bowen was slapped by his teacher at Martin Luther King Jr., Elementary School, no one really heard about it. Except for President Obama, Vice President Biden, their wives, three senators, and more than 20 other officials. </p>
<p>They all were CC&rsquo;ed on the whopping <a href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3364241">40-page letter</a> that Curtis&rsquo; mother, Lisa Henry Bowen, sent to school district superintendent John Covington. In it, Bowen makes mind-boggling demands for reparations. One recipient called the letter &#8220;one of the craziest things I&rsquo;ve ever seen&#8221; and leaked it to the Internet. And Lisa Henry Bowen even created her own web site for the occasion: www.CurtisGotSlapped.com.</p>
<p>Lisa Henry Bowen, who copyrights her name and her son&rsquo;s name throughout the letter, kicks it off by identifying herself as the &#8220;intellectual property owner&#8221; of fourth grader Curtis Bowen (C). She alleges that Curtis was caught horse playing and was slapped by a teacher named Ms. Curry. Lisa Henry tried to report the teacher to social services for child abuse, but was denied as Curtis&rsquo; skin wasn&rsquo;t broken.</p>
<p>That sent Lisa Henry into a spiral of outrage. She calls Ms. Curry &#8220;one audacious white bitch with &#8216;balls&rsquo;&#8221;, and then conducts some informal gonad comparisons. &#8220;I happen to have some big &#8216;balls&rsquo; too. And I ain&rsquo;t afraid to use them.&#8221; (All emphasis hers, throughout.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Bowen uses her balls-to-the-wall logic to devise a way for the school district to repay her. She claims that Curry slapped 1/4 of Curtis&rsquo; &#8220;million dollar face.&#8221; Therefore, Lisa Henry encloses a homemade bill for a quarter of a million dollars. The $250K bill is issued to five educational entities, so she&rsquo;s really demanding more than $1 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The weird part about Lisa Henry&rsquo;s list of reparations is that most of them have nothing to do with her child being slapped. Sure, she makes a few perfunctory demands to improve the school district, including the introduction of a &#8220;We Don&rsquo;t Hit Kids Here&#8221; campaign throughout Kansas City and a revocation of Ms. Curry&rsquo;s teaching license. But she reserves the real meat of reparations for Curtis and herself. </p>
<p>Curtis shall receive, among many other things: $13,500 worth of Wal-Mart gift cards, a free college education, two trips to Disney World, nine years of private tennis lessons on the Plaza, season tickets to the opera, theater, and ballet, almost a decade&rsquo;s worth of psychological counseling by &#8220;the best black child psychologist in the country,&#8221; a whole orchestra&rsquo;s worth of new musical instruments, a three-week trip to Africa at a five-star hotel, and a personal audience with President Obama.</p>
<p>Lisa Henry&rsquo;s demands are just as WTF-worthy. She demands the full payment of her mortgage, a new car, home remodeling, free psychological, dental, and medical care for the next nine years, and the cherry on the sundae:<br>
&#8220;Independent consulting contract position with the Kansas City Missouri School district, for the next nine years. My consulting fee begins at $15,000 per month, minimum 6 months contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because nothing screams &#8220;hire me&#8221; like a maniacal 40-page threat. </p>
<p>The mother ironically rants to President Obama and Dr. Covington about how the educational system doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;give a damn about black children.&#8221; </p>
<p>She almost loses it at the end:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time, in THIS AMERICA, when a white woman could get away with slapping black children around. There was a time, in THIS AMERICA, when a black woman had no choice, but to accept her children being slapped, whipped, rapped [sic, we think], abused, molested and psychologically tortured by this white supremacist society.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.There WAS a time. I AIN&rsquo;T THAT BLACK MOTHER, THIS AIN&rsquo;T THAT TIME!!!!!! THIS AIN&rsquo;T THAT AMERICA!!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>A message to the haters: Lisa Henry Bowen (C) invites anyone who thinks she&rsquo;s gone a little overboard to &#8220;KISS MY ENTIRE BLACK ASS!!!!!! I HAVEN&rsquo;T BEGUN TO GO FAR ENOUGH!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yet, she can&rsquo;t seem to think that she herself would need some help from a really good psychologist, black or otherwise?</p>
<p>Methinks AR will have another story about her in the near future, only this time it&rsquo;ll involve being involuntarily admitted into some institution, either correctional or mental.</p>

		<p>The problem here actually is Ms. Curry.</p>
<p>No, the slapping wasn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong if done appropriately.  (Teachers in my grade school used to spank us kids with sticks in the front of class!)</p>
<p>The problem is a greater issue. You CANNOT discipline a child of another race if you are white.  You will be called a racist, evil, everything in the book.  Black children especially fall under this rule.  The liberals and shake-down artists will rake you over the coals.</p>
<p>As a person who has taught black children before, I can tell you almost all of them act up almost all of the time.  There&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it and many a white teacher has been driven insane and left the profession on account of it.</p>
<p>My advice is let the little darlings do whatever they want.  IF they disrupt your class all the time, smile and hold your tongue.  Make your reports to the dean or social worker or whatever, daily if necessary.  Refer them to the office also.  Put the problem on the administration to cover your behind.</p>
<p>Many teachers I know keep toys in their classrooms for the black kids to play with while the teacher tries to teach the 10% of the kids who will pay attention.  Go along with this new-fangled &#8216;project based learning&rsquo; garbage.  </p>
<p>Keep them busy with scissors and glue and glitter making useless posterboards, models of famous places, hand drawn art with their names in big letters.  But do not dream of being allowed to treat a non-white child like you think a white kid should be treated in similar circumstances.  </p>
<p>It may take a village to raise a child, but if half the village is not supporting you, then it&rsquo;s best to go on autopilot and look after your own!</p>

		<p>The web site is hilariously bad.  It&rsquo;s as if Curtis himself put it together.  Unfortunately the link to the 40 page letter doesn&rsquo;t work.  OK, hands everybody, How many knew this kind of thinking would soon enough bubble to the top once a black president was elected?  You can&rsquo;t buy this kind of comedy.  Obama should personally call her and tell her to back TF off.<br>

<p>Well, that almost sounds like a threat of violence. Given the grandiose and unbalanced nature of her demands, this may not be too far off the mark to speculate about. At they very least, she should be given the once over by competent psychiatrist, with a possible all expenses paid trip to a psych ward in a county psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>And as for her precious &ldquo;little&rdquo; Curtis, Heaven only knows what he must be like now and what kind of arrogant afrocentric monster he will be as an adult. I am sure, given the kind delusional anti-white &ldquo;upbringing&rdquo; his mother is giving him now, by age 18 or 21 he will be going to the pokey for the rape and murder of  an &ldquo;audacious white b****&rdquo; or two. </p>
<p>You know the kind, &ldquo;audacious&rdquo; and &ldquo;racist&rdquo; enough not to want to date or mate with his black majesty on a voluntary basis, because &lsquo;they be owing it&rsquo; to him.</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>Read the 40-page letter.  This isn&rsquo;t just the ghetto lottery, this is ghetto alchemy.</p>
<p>First, the woman, with her references to &#8220;Prison-Industrial Complex,&#8221; &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; &#8220;white supremist&#8221; (sic), COINTELPRO, HAARP, &#8220;Tuskegee,&#8221; and her demands for meetings with Cornell West, Eric Dyson, Farrakhan, and others by name, that makes me think she&rsquo;s a black radical activist of some sort.  (She didn&rsquo;t mention Henry Louis Gates.  His feelings must be hurt.  Now you know why he staged that whole &#8220;arrest&#8221; incident last year.  Yes, I&rsquo;m opening the Pandora&rsquo;s Box.)</p>
<p>She does claim to have a jazz career, and this is why she intersperses so many musical demands for her son in this letter.  It must not be much of a career, because she can&rsquo;t seem to afford by herself all these exquisite demands she is making of others.  Heck, she wants a $250 a month QT gas station card, so her jazz career must not even be keeping her car gassed up.</p>
<p>She wants her monetary requests either in the form of money orders or silver, and explicitly asks that they not cut her any checks, purportedly because she doesn&rsquo;t think KCPS checks are any good. (Many of them aren&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.)  She wants money orders or silver because she&rsquo;s probably got debts, unpaid fines, or other financial rocks on her name, or there&rsquo;s some welfare or quasi-welfare benefit she&rsquo;s trying to protect.  (Oops, I forgot, she can&rsquo;t be on welfare, she&rsquo;s a strong black woman with a successful jazz career.)  If she takes checks and cashes them or banks then, then that money is &#8220;on the grid,&#8221; and therefore can be escrowed/requisitioned to pay debts, judgments, fines in arrears, and/or be used to reduce or eliminate one or more welfare programs she is on.</p>
<p>She wants the state to pay the son&rsquo;s education all the way to Master&rsquo;s Degree level.  Why not demand a Ph.D.?</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s sad, and at the same time frightening, is that Lisa Henry Bowen is well within the mainstream of black thinking. It&rsquo;s only her initiative that I find extraordinary in this matter. And she sort of succeeded in setting up a website.</p>

		<p>I liked this demand: &#8220;A 1500$ WalMart gift card - for the next 9 years Curtis is in school,&#8221; and the one about annual trips to Disney land for two years (&#8220;5 round-trip airline tickets [business class]&#8221;).</p>

		<p>Another example of black sociopathy.  Remember Haiti earthquake survivors wanting new houses and $10,000+ from aid workers about two months ago?  Or that African bishop in England who accused Europeans of underdeveloping Africa a month and a half ago?  Lisa Henry Bowen is not an odd case, she is the norm with African people.  Everything in her letter is old, tired rhetoric in the black community.  This illustrates how non-white people use the threat of &#8220;racism&#8221; to gain leverage from white people.  It&rsquo;s about getting things.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see what would happen if she could be transported to a segregated school in Georgia in the 1930&rsquo;s. Black teachers kept baseball bats on their desks and getting smacked once or twice was fairly light punishment. But then again, magical thinking rears its ugly head. Then again. this is KC, where a Federal Judge tried to rebuild the school system by forcing Missouri to pony up billions and it was all for naught.  </p>
<p>What kind of demands will be made when Curtis is in the State Pen for Armed Robbery, Arson, Murder, and Carjacking?</p>

		<p> Curtis got slapped? Curtis also got a raving lunatic for a momma. The story is funny in one way   &mdash;   listen to the crazy black woman, ranting and raving. In another way, it&rsquo;s simply indicative of how blacks tend to behave, here, there and yonder: Poor impulse control (known in the vernacular as &#8220;going off half-cocked&#8221;;) a glorying in victimhood, often without a shred of evidence to back up the claims; threats of physical violence, of humongous lawsuits, demands for reparations, ad nauseum.</p>
<p> When I was in (an all-White) elementary school, our teachers didn&rsquo;t waste time with &#8220;slapping&#8221; kids; if you deserved corporal punishment, you got whacked across the backside with a paddle. And you hoped your brother or sister wouldn&rsquo;t carry the story home, because if they did, you&rsquo;d get another dose from your parents. They backed up teachers in those days; now, the black ones, at least, threaten to sue, assault, and make life miserable for the teacher. All hail &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Since this woman had a child, I have to assume that some man had sex with her.  Boy do I feel sorry for this guy.  This woman is crazier than Glenn Close playing the &#8216;bunny boiler&rsquo; in the film Fatal Attraction.  She just goes on and on.  It&rsquo;s a real good thing that she is no position of authority or consequence.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a powerful and furious mad intelligence in this woman. Glad to see that it&rsquo;s wasted on insignificant nonsense.  And glad that her demented fury is not directed at me.</p>

		<p>I taught school for 23 years the last four in a school predominantly black. This period in my life was a virtual time of horror. The kids for the most part were like wild little animals without manners or human feelings. The parent and I said parent because there never seemed to be a Mr. were even worse, lying awake nights dreaming of more ways to drain &#8220;whiteys&#8221; pocket book. I was not racist in anyway until I put in these last four years with these creatures from He*l and NOW I understand what a burden on society these people really are .</p>

<p>I am sure that poor Curtis is just an innocent little angel. He was minding his own buisness, and then whitey came up and slapped poor Curtis silly for no reason at all. </p>
<p>I am quite sure that once Al Sharpton hears about this injustice, and reads this mother&rsquo;s heartbreaking request for compensation, that reparations will be given and order and justice will return. Because remember folks&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

_____________</p>
<p>Yes, and these demands serve to show how utterly futile it is to try to appease blacks by buying them off. Their greed is boundless. Ditto their imaginations. No matter how much you give them, they will always want more. It&rsquo;s a wonder this woman didn&rsquo;t just demand the keys to the US Treasury.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what she&rsquo;d want if her little Curtis got SPANKED?</p>

		<p>Black kids are about the most poorly behaved children out there! If I had been slapped or spanked in school my parents would have asked me what I had done to deserve it and would have followed up at home with another spanking! Just last night a larger black child took my daughter&rsquo;s toy and would not give it back. My husband begged her- all the while my daughter is screaming but the little brat just held on and said in a defiant tone &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to!!!!&#8221; we finally got it back but her dad had to intervene. Just tacky- I would have spanked my child if she behaved like that! Curtis probably deserved the slap.</p>

		<p>Since all the claimed &#8220;damages&#8221; are based solely on the fact the teacher was white, I guess it would have been OK for a teacher to slap the little darling if she were black. How &#8216;bout a half-black teacher? Still OK? </p>

<p>Correct response, straight from Saul Alinsky&rsquo;s handbook:</p>
<p>Rule #5:  <b>Ridicule is man&rsquo;s most potent weapon.</b></p>
<p>It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.</p>
<p>Nothing like taking a tactic from one&rsquo;s enemies and using it against him!</p>
<p>So&hellip;.Laugh AWAY!  (I read this aloud to friends and family, much funnier that way, funnier still when told these demands are  deadly serious and also typical of blacks:  Remember, I&rsquo;m an educator, and you should be too, tell everyone you know the reality about blacks, it will save them a lot of grief and may save their lives as well).</p>
<p>But, it won&rsquo;t be so funny if she receives even one of her demands, which I have a feeling she will&hellip;</p>

		<p>I can accept that she was upset about her little &#8220;thug in training&#8221; Curtis getting slapped (which he no doubt deserved) but that list of demands is ridiculous. The authorities should remove little Curtis and any siblings from the home as parent(s) with delusions of grandeur are mentally unstable and unfit to raise a child.</p>

		<p>First, in regards to poster 9, I really wonder about blacks being seroulsy mentally disturbed.  Many of them seem to meet the profiles of either borderline personality disorders, narcissm, and or sociopathy.  I see it everyday where I live in the South, from their reckless, dangerous and angry driving habits to getting automatically pissed off if anyone asks them to behave decently in a public place:  i.e. keeping their voices down, being polite, etc.  Seriously, have any psychologists or psychiatrists done studies along these lines, that is the prevelence of personality disorders in blacks? I would like to know.</p>

That is why    &mdash;   after long experience and observation -  I have concluded that it is best to have only black teachers teach blacks; black supervisors manage blacks; black cops patrol black neighborhoods, etc., etc.</p>
<p>They will howl, yes, when they&rsquo;re under the control of other blacks, but at least they can&rsquo;t play the racism game and whine about discrimination. The other blacks will put them in their place, while most whites are too timid to talk back, fearing the awful &#8220;racisss&#8221; word.</p>

I agree with you. But it&rsquo;s funny how people can see themselves so differently.  I remember one occasion when a black woman, commenting on Hispanics, said:   <br>
&#8220;What&rsquo;s wrong with people nowadays?   Are blacks the only ones who discipline their children?  Are we the only ones who teach our children manners?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was speechless.</p>

Many of us are on here BECAUSE we are ex-teachers and had to put up with parents like this and their offspring, who did their best to make teaching impossible (when they bothered to come to school.)

		<p>true story. I was at the post office. I waited and waited and waited until finally I was next in line. Suddenly a black woman who I had never seen, walked straight to the front of the line, which was closer to her, but she hadnt been in line at all. </p>
<p>At first I thought It was a mistake and tried to explain it to her &#8220;Oh I&rsquo;m sorry, the line actually starts on the other end&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your business I was here first&#8221; she screamed back</p>
<p>should I have punched her?</p>

<p>Just be careful my friend.  You have something (blacks, mexicans and black loving whites) covet but will never have:  Superior Intellect. </p>
<p>And they know it.</p>
<p>Just be prepared for the following:</p>
<p>First will come the increasingly loud voice to try to shout you down when they realize they are out-matched, overcome and incapable of forming a reasonable argument or refuting your irrefutable facts.</p>
<p>Next, expect to be called a Nazi or Racist as they hope to intimidate you and shut you up.  At this point they&rsquo;ll call on their racial comrades to &#8216;get their back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In rapid succession, and usually without warning will come violence in the form of a punch straight to your face or some other type of vicious physical assault.</p>
<p>For them, this is winning a debate against a White, Racist Nazi   &mdash;   or so they&rsquo;ll brag to anyone who&rsquo;ll listen.</p>
<p>As for Communist and Socialists.  Many of them DO have superior intellect, making them far more dangerous.  They are well aware of whatever facts you may present but are wholly impervious to them.  </p>
<p>Their goal is not to dispute your facts:   It is to destroy you By Whatever Means Necessary.  They are blinded by hatred of you and use Communism and Socialism to keep you down and achieve their goal of a White-Free NWO.</p>
<p>They cannot fight you intellectually because the facts ARE your side so they&rsquo;ll use tactics such as recruiting black activists, fronting mexican organizations and making promises to stupid White Liberals to proxy for them, that is, to fight and destroy you. </p>
<p>Useful Idiot blacks, mexicans and White libs will be discarded after they&rsquo;ve served their purpose, probably by a firing squad or a bullet to the back of the head (Soviet Style).</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  the media, academia and the Justice Department are on their side, not yours, will back them up, not you, and they know it.   They&rsquo;re particularly fond of calling out their attack dogs in the SPLC to pressure your boss to fire you.   If they can get one more unintelligent justice on SCOTUS like Sotomayor or Kagan, their job of White destruction will be made infinitely easier.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;ll end with this quote from the &#8216;funniest&rsquo; of the Marx Brothers:</p>
<p>The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism .</p>
<p>-Karl Marx </p>

<p>You are so right.<br>
I also am a retired teacher with well over 25 years of experience.<br>
I still wonder at the Progressive/Liberal attitude of most younger teachers. Anyone who teaches in &#8220;diverse&#8221; public schools <br>
(diverse being a code word that has nothing to do with Korean or Chinese American kids) for more than ten years may still talk the liberal talk but they don&rsquo;t walk the liberal walk especially where they choose to live and the schools to which they send their children; my own son being a prime example.  </p>

		<p>Did she slap him in some defense of someone? Or was it punishment?</p>
<p>Due process should be given before punishment.  Maybe the government is not doing their job with the due process.  It could be morally right to take matters into ones own hands insome situations, but are we there yet?<br>
  <br>
I think that, unless the woman was defending someone from injury, the slapping was illegal.</p>

		<p>I could care less as long as Californians pay the tab.  No, that&rsquo;s not really true.  The truth is I think it&rsquo;s wonderful if Californians are stuck with this tab.  I hope every evil thing in the world that can happen due to accepting illegals happens to Californians and hopefully wakes up the rest of the country before it is also too late for them.</p>
