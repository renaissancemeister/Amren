<h1><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/29/news/economy/jobs_immigrants/">Immigrants Top Native Born in U.S. Job Hunt</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants have gained hundreds of thousands of jobs since the Great Recession is said to have ended, while U.S.-born workers lost more than a million jobs, according to a study released Friday.</p>
<p>Native-born workers lost 1.2 million jobs in the year following June 2009, when economists say the recession officially ended, reported the Pew Hispanic Center, a division of the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>In that same period of time, foreign-born workers gained 656,000 jobs, according to the center, which based its analysis on statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>The study did not specify whether or not the immigrants were authorized to be in the United States. A separate Pew study released earlier this year said 7.8 million immigrants, about a third of the foreign-born labor force, are unauthorized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the reasons why immigrants tend to outperform native-born Americans is because they&rsquo;re willing to take less desirable jobs, said Kochhar [Rakesh Kochhar, association director of research at the Pew Hispanic Center].</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re generally more flexible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They come here to work. They don&rsquo;t care necessarily whether it&rsquo;s in New York or L.A. or Dallas or Atlanta. They also tend to be more flexible in regards to the wages and the hours they put in.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be that in the search for jobs in the recovery, immigrants were more accepting of lower wages and reduced hours because many, especially unauthorized immigrants, are not eligible for unemployment benefits,&#8221; read the report.</p>
<p>The willingness for immigrants to take jobs that Americans don&rsquo;t want was demonstrated this summer, when the United Farm Workers of America launched its &#8220;Take Our Jobs&#8221; campaign. In response to anti-immigrant rhetoric, the predominantly Hispanic union offered to place native-born workers in farm jobs. Several thousand Americans responded to the online ad, but only several people actually accepted the back-breaking, low-paying jobs.</p>

<p>Whites don&rsquo;t want to work these jobs? If the races were reversed (as it always seems to be) the paper&rsquo;s position would be that any shortage must be do to discrimination, and a hostile, racist, work environment. And whites would be expected to be ashamed. In fact, that&rsquo;s how it always works. </p>

How many times have we been told by the American haters that immigrants don&rsquo;t take American jobs?</p>
<p>Immigrants are being used to drive down wages and drive out American workers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not paranoia when people are out to get you.</p>

		<p>It will take a multi-fold policy change to stop the insanity of paying people not to work while paying invaders to colonise America.  If we stopped paying welfare, more people would be willing to work at the more difficult manual labor type jobs.  Also, if we removed the excess labor supply, the wages would be higher. We would pay more for food or other services, but the result would be a stronger middle class and a stronger, wealthier America.  While I believe such a policy change would be beneficial to our nation, I have no hope of any such changes taking place in the near future.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It might be that in the search for jobs in the recovery, immigrants were more accepting of lower wages and reduced hours because many, especially unauthorized immigrants, are not eligible for unemployment benefits&rdquo; </p>
<p>Economist Thomas Sowell elaborates on the effect of millions illegal workers on wage levels and the employment opportunities of American citizens:   </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Leaving prices out of the picture is probably the source of more fallacies in economics than any other single misconception. At current wages for low-level jobs and current levels of welfare, there are indeed many jobs that Americans will not take. The fact that immigrants  &mdash;  and especially illegal immigrants  &mdash;  will take those jobs is the very reason the wage levels will not rise enough to attract Americans &hellip; . It is elementary supply and demand. Yet we continue to hear about the &#8216;need&rsquo; for immigrants to do jobs that Americans will not do  &mdash;  even though these are all jobs that Americans have done for generations before mass illegal immigration became a way of life.&#8221;<br>

<p>The last sentence sums it up nicely. These immigrants will work for slave wage labor whereas Americans can&rsquo;t afford to, pay taxes and still feed their families. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing they do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do. Americans did all these jobs before. The do the jobs Americans can&rsquo;t afford to do on such low wages. Anyways, even if there were a genuine shortage in a few of these jobs, such as migrant work, we don&rsquo;t need millions of immigrants.</p>

		<p>It seems to me a lot of white businessmen like their &ldquo;mexicans.&rdquo; One experience is when a contractor came to my home to estimate putting insulation in the attic. My wife asked the &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; how long it would take to put in the insulation. The guy became animated talking about how the job would be done really fast because he had mexicans who worked really hard. He then went on about much he liked his mexicans because they did not bring with them problems that white men did. She then asked him if he paid the mexican well. He said he did.</p>
<p>I then asked the guy if the mexicans were legal. He assured me they were. I asked him if he had verified the mexican&rsquo;s social security numbers to make sure they were not counterfeit or a result of identification theft. He said he had done that. We thanked him and have not heard back from him. My thinking is that if you do not have the ability to manage white men, you are not going to get any work from me. I do not see colored people as the problem. I see my own kind selling us out.<br>

		<p>I cant get a job in the NYC area because I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish. I&rsquo;ve applied at Citibank and hundreds of other places and am always told that I&rsquo;m &#8220;not a Good Fit.&#8221;  Every time I investigated who it was that actually was hired, it turns out to be a Hispanic woman who barely speaks English.  </p>

		<p>The reason that most Americans will not take one (or two or more ) of these low paying jobs and the immigrants will is that the immigrants will work &#8220;under the table&#8221; and take welfare, Medicaid, WIC and other aid packages. The American will not be eligable for most aid since they &#8220;make too much money&#8221; on paper. Therefore the immigrant will get almost all of his basic needs met and have whatever cash he gets from his job. Since taxes and other deductions are pulled out of a citizen&rsquo;s paycheck 10.00 an hour can be as low as 8.50 when the gov gets a cut. Adding up all the benefits that citizens pay for- an illegal working under the table easily doubles his income while the citizen has to figure out how to make due after taxes, housing, utilities, medical and other expenses come out. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said this for years: how much money could be saved if welfare were a &#8216;work for welfare&rsquo; program? If you are able bodied, you will do SOMETHING every week to get a check. If getting paid benefits by the hour was enacted and people had to do something as menial as pick up trash, paint buildings, cut grass, rake leaves, ANYTHING - it would sort itself out. Those who don&rsquo;t want to do much and are satisfied with just getting by will stay at their low level. Those who are tired of working for almost nothing will get off the roles and either get a real job or get nothing. Those who are truly disabled will get support through disability, and tons of government jobs doing these menial tasks can be eliminated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not the only answer - we desperately need to slap an import tax so high on products coming into the U.S. that U.S. manufacturers off shore would eat up so much of their obscene profits that it would entice them to bring back their facilities to the U.S. so that people here could actually BUY what they make; at least level the playing field somewhat.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s way too much money to be made in the status quo for both issues for anyone to change it. </p>

		<p>Drew has the right idea, and we should ALL follow that course.  We recently had windows installed throughout our entire house.  We ENSURED the foreman was white American, and specifically asked him who his workers were, verifying they were (1) legal Americans (2) white (3) regular employees and (4) NOBODY but those folks would actually do the work on-site.  If we ALL refused work by contractors who used Mexican (either legal or illegal) labor, or told them to get off your property if they showed up with a crew of Mexicans, the contractors would soon get the idea.  Extend that to all service type work - refuse to patronize anybody staffing with Mexicans legal or illegal.  In most cases, if you see a Mexican, he is NOT legal - particularly in restaurants, hotels, work crews, auto shops, etc.  Sad thing is, too many of us whine about all the illegals, but turn around and allow them to roof our houses etc in order to &#8220;save a buck&#8221;.  That &#8220;saved buck&#8221; does NOT go back into our economy.  It goes to drugs, child prostitutes, and mostly BACK TO MEXICO.<br>

		<p>KC #5: Many years ago, I worked in several Country Clubs as a Cook. They were loaded with Mexican and others from all over Central and South America. </p>
<p>I was told that since these Mexicans and other were expected to work every day, and start at about 6:00 a.m., that they were given a mattress and blanket and slept in the attic of these old Clubs. Roughly 20 of them slept in one Club&rsquo;s attic. </p>
<p>These Mexicans were earning minimun wage to $10.00 per hour, depending on their skills and time there. Ten dollars an hour was pretty good money for a Cook then. Even now, it&rsquo;s not too bad. </p>
<p>But then, they did&rsquo;t have to put gas and oil in a car, pay for car insurance and the rest, like Registrations and Inspections, groceries, heating, electric, property taxes and the rest of every day living Whites have to pay for. </p>
<p>So, the Mexicans et al. got to send their money home to their families, and have much more to spend on Tequila and beer, while we struggled to stretch our dollars as far as we could, to live on. </p>
<p>They did this, all while collecting benefits from Welfare, Food Stamps, and Medicaid, which we working Whites, stuggling to feed our families, have paid for, with our taxes. We can&rsquo;t get any of these Services, if we needed them, but these Illegal Aliens can. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigrants are more flexible&#8221;<br>
Translation: they&rsquo;ll work for third-world wages, which is why the elites love illegals. Why hire a native-born American to do a job that an illegal will do for the half the price? Cuts down on wages, health benefits, and those pesky safety and health regulations. Never mind the long-term costs of such a policy, we need cheap labor. I am reminded of something that was said about white South African elites who opposed racial separation because they wanted cheap black labor: That they would rather be murdered in their beds than make them. That certainly seems to be the case with our elites as well. Unfortunately, while South Africans can flee to Australia, Great Britain, and Canada, there won&rsquo;t be any place for us to run to when the hammer drops, because the same suicidal immigration policies are being followed everywhere.</p>

<p>In Finland, where I live, foreigners are used as cheap labour. This results unemployment of the natives and makes bad business models viable. Hence there is less incentive to improve business models to be so profitable that decent salaries could be paid.  The government controlled radio and tv as well as the mainstream printed media are advocating the multiculture and blaming the natives racists etc. Also people posting criticism on blogs and net forums are sued by the government and so far punished with fines.</p>

		<p>Businesses that can&rsquo;t survive without migrant labour should perish in the marketplace.</p>
<p>In Eastern Canada, where the brown migrant invasion hasn&rsquo;t reached yet, malls and franchises close when there is nobody to work them.</p>
<p>Since many of the jobs the migrants do are landscaping, fast food and retail, the market ends up being less competitive. This means the survivors can pay decently, and are forced to do so.</p>
<p>This is how America could be. </p>
