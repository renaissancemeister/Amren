	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Check out these statistics from the &#8220;<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/analysis_and_planning/crime_and_enforcement_activity.shtml">Crime and Enforcement Activity in New York City</a>&#8221; report for the first six months of 2010.</p>
<p>Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter victims are most frequently Black (67.0%) or Hispanic (28.1%). White victims account for (3.2%) of all Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter victims while Asian/Pacific Islanders account for (1.8%) of all Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter victims. </p>
<p>The Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter arrest population is similarly distributed. Black arrestees (53.8%) and Hispanic arrestees (36.4%) account for the majority of Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter arrestees while White arrestees (7.1%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (2.2%) arrestees account for the remaining portions of the Murder and Non-Negligent Manslaughter arrest population. </p>
<p>Shooting victims are most frequently Black (73.8%) or Hispanic (22.1 %). White victims account for an additional (2.6%) of all Shooting victims while Asian/Pacific Islanders victims account for (1.2%) of all Shooting Victims. </p>
<p>The Shooting arrest population is similarly distributed. Black arrestees (70.9%) and Hispanic arrestees (25.8%) account for the majority of Shooting arrest population. White arrestees (2.5%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (0.9%) account for the remaining portion of the Shooting arrest population.</p>
<p>In short, 95.1 percent of all murder victims and 95.9 percent of all shooting victims in New York City are black or Hispanic. And 90.2 percent of those arrested for murder and 96.7 percent of those arrested for shooting someone are black and Hispanic. I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin to describe the horror I still feel looking at those numbers. But the word &#8220;hunted&#8221; comes to mind.</p>

		<p>Mr. Capehart:  You forgot &#8220;hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>What interests me is that for Murder/NNM, blacks were a little more likely to be victims than be arrested for it, while Hispanics, just the opposite.  Possible explanations are that there is a lot of Hispanic-on-black murders, or that some of the black murderers of other blacks have not yet been caught.</p>
<p>Whites are only 3.2% of victims of Murder/NMM, but 7.1% of those arrested for it.  Only theory I can come up with is that the over-classification of &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Imagine these statistics:<br>
96.7% of people arrested for shooting someone are either Black or Hispanic!!!  Whites account for 2.6%.  Incredible!!!  </p>
<p>You know when I first saw what publication the article came from and realized that it was the Washington Post, the first thought that entered my mind was, &#8220;how come no one is screaming racism at the writer&#8221;? So I clicked on the title above and it sent me to washingtonpost.com.  The writer is a Black man.  I guess it&rsquo;s only all right when a Black gives the statistics the way they really are.  If a White writer wrote that article he would have been fired the next day.</p>

		<p> these statistics are revealing, especially when you consider that mainstream popular entertainment reverses the stats and have 70%+ fictional TV criminals portrayed as White men. If you can stand it, check out any of the CSI,  Criminal Minds, etc. In almost every case Whites are the bad guys and killers.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;People have railed against black-on-black crime for decades. And yet it persists.&#8221;</p>
<p>He indicates suprise at the actual crime figures, then admits above knowing that people have been upset by them for a long time. So why didn&rsquo;t he get the information himself, instead of whining about too many blacks being arrested as he has done in the past? It&rsquo;s readily available.  </p>
<p>This illustrates the black mentality perfectly.  Like all of them, he whines about some imagined problem, but never checks into it for accuracy or he&rsquo;s in denial about it based only on his desire to stand with the brothers against whitey. </p>
<p>&#8220;People have also railed   &mdash;   and rightly so   &mdash;   against the disproportionate application of the law against people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rightly so?&#8221;  Nonsense.  Again a check of the records will reveal that black sentences are not only commensurate with the crime, many blacks are given light punishment or no punishment at all, time and time again.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that this AA recipient for the news job he has would have uttered a thing about the stats if the commissioner hadn&rsquo;t brought them to his attention, probably after he was whining about so many blacks in prison to the commissioner.</p>
<p>These blacks are given AA jobs by the corporate geeks who fear rioting as a threat to their power, money and position, thinking a news position will placate them.  Utterly ridiculous.  All it does is enable them to lie more and incite more blacks to the level of intense rage.</p>
<p>EVERY SINGLE BLACK that has the option of writing what he wants writes about NOTHING BUT race and how bad blacks have it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sick of them, and their imagined ills.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably because cases with white, Hispanic or Asian killers are more likely to be solved.  It certainly is not because blacks are being killed much by members of other races.  </p>

		<p>I do hope the statistics are accurate. Hopefully, the low number of white victims really is well under five percent. As for the rest, let the lowest common denominator prevail. Parts of Manhattan remain white. Security can keep those sections safe and seperate from the rotting corpse. Hey, Mayor Bloomberg lives on the East Side, so you know that&rsquo;s a safe place.</p>

<p>Bravo! That is something that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ask of a northerner, particularly one who gloats about which side won the War Between the States. My answer? NO ONE. We all lost; north, south, east, and west, we&rsquo;re paying severely for the so-called victory of the side that should have stood shoulder to shoulder with their White brethren rather than waging war against us because we seceded after outrageous taxes and the desecration of states&rsquo; rights. </p>
<p>We now have a squelching jellyfish of a federal government and a founding population that has been driven out of our own cities and neighborhoods by those who were never meant to be citizens of this nation.</p>
<p>Well done, northerners. Congratulations on your big win. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they know that viewers like me will change the channel if the crime being invesigated is black-on-black.  Because we don&rsquo;t give a damn who did it.  I recall an early episode of CSI that dealt with a gang-banger shootout; I didn&rsquo;t hang around to find out which piece of excrement killed the other one, nor could I believe that the investigators, in real life, would care much either.</p>

		<p>Capehart is a sissy acting black, which means he acts White better than most of them.  Watch him on TV- he sounds like a woman, always talking about his feelings- &#8220;my heart sank,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Actually, he&rsquo;s a shrewd player at winning the game of race politics. Blacks have advanced because we Whites have sacrificed so much for them, which we did out of guilt and pity.</p>
<p>Blacks know that we have a weakness for compassion, especially toward them when they act all hurt and oppressed, because we believe in Equality and that their pain is our pain, for we are all one, brothers and sister alike.</p>
<p>Anytime you hear blacks talking about their &#8220;pain,&#8221; lock your doors and hide your wallet.</p>

		<p>To Southern Belle-</p>
<p>We did all lose, and the mystery of it all, the perplexity, the anathema, is that Lincoln was more of a race realist than the White Southerners.  He wanted to ship the blacks back home to Africa. He wanted free White labour working the land and building the nation.  He should have made a peace treaty with the Whites that said: &#8220;You stop shipping your cotton to England, ship it to us instead, we&rsquo;ll drop the tariff is you agree to ship your excess blacks back to Africa and keep them away from the North.&#8221;</p>
<p>Same for WWII. We should have made a peace treaty with Hitler that contained him westward as long as his territorial ambitions could be directed southward instead of eastward to set up a wall against the non white Muslims.<br>

<p>It was YOU SOUTHERNERS who GAVE US the black problem in the FIRST PLACE by having SLAVERY. And had the north let the south secede you would now have ALL the blacks NOW in the north as well as those who stayed in the south. You southerners created this problem for us all and then off-loaded some of it on to us. Then you call us to task for it? Thanks!</p>

Crime, murder and hand guns are illegal so none of this can be true.<br>

		<p>Since you are not allowed to own a firearm [handgun?] in NYC, there CANNOT BE any gun violence. These crimes must not be occurring. They cannot occur because no one in NYC is allowed to own a firearm [handgun?]. It has been like that for decades now. So this must be all a fabrication. It is a mirage people are seeing. </p>
<p>And those white victims. The percentage is very small. And I bet that almost all of those whitey are shot by a Bantu or a Puerto Rican or other, NOT by another whitey.</p>

		<p>This guy Capehart is reacting just as I&rsquo;ve been saying Bantus react, whenever Jamarcus Washington is shot by Willie Kasavubu:</p>
<p>Wringing of the hands, and calling for more gun control. Despite the fact that New York City has some of the most draconian gun laws on the books.</p>
<p>Volumes have been written about white police officers shooting Bantus, in New York and elsewhere. That&rsquo;s where Bantus foam at the mouth and scream &#8220;racism&#8221;. Yet, they are mostly silent, whenever Bantus kill one another. Or else, they rage against guns, and have big meetings and speeches denouncing guns. They&rsquo;ll also have gun &#8220;buy-back&#8221; schemes; and proclaim success if 200 guns are turned in, for gift cards.</p>
<p>This writer Capehart comes across as someone who laments the high crime statistics among Bantus, because they&rsquo;re higher than Caucasian crime rates. He probably wishes the rates were equal.</p>
<p>To Grob Hahn (re post # 2):</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why newspapers are all of a sudden publishing crime stats that openly confirm what we knew to be the truth. Maybe it has to do with an awakening racial realization, especially post-election. Maybe the press is turning against Obama and his regime. By publishing stats like these, it shows that the more things change (Obama&rsquo;s election), the more they remain the same (Bantu on Bantu crime), after all. Who among us here at Amren, seriously thought that Bantus would stop killing each other simply because Obama was elected?   </p>

<p>Yet the New York state and city governments continue to insist that the way to deal with this is to impose strict gun control laws on law-abiding, mostly white, gun owners who merely seek to protect themselves and only want to be allowed to own guns legally.</p>

		<p>I believe white Americans tolerate the black/hispanic crime wave because it pays the bills.  Think of all the jobs that whites have due to black/hispanic crime. Police, lawyers, judges, prison guards, transporters, etc, etc.  Black/hispanic crime pays.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Harumphty&#8221; stole some of my thunder, as I was going to indicate that blacks are only a quarter of the NYC population, and Hispanics slightly more. Thus, statistically, their over-representation here is blindlingly obvious(and just as predictable, of course). </p>
<p>But what those who have never been to NYC cannot fully appreciate, is that you can spend a good deal of time there, cover quite a bit of territory and, depending how well you plan, see remarkably FEW blacks or Hispanics at all!! I know some find this impossible to believe, but it is so. I frequent parts of Manhatten and Brooklyn, and am still amazed at how few blacks and browns one sees in these areas. Sure they are there, but not in high numbers.<br>
Granted, much of the city is indeed a multiracial/ethnic mish-mash, but a good deal is not. Thus, even in the supposed utopia of multiculturalism, people STILL separate readily, and do so for good reason - one look at those murder statistics should tell any sensible person all they need to know about blacks and Hispanics.  <br>

		<p>I really wish they had included the stats for black males raping white females.  I read somewhere that white women are something like 10 times more likely to be raped by a black man than a white man.  That is what makes all these black male/white female couples so bizarre to me&hellip;.black men are so dangerous.  I do not understand why other white women cannot sense this danger and stay clear.   </p>

<p>Dumpty just wanted to show that the 95% of murders make 50% of the population. That means if you have 100 people and 50 are white. They make a rate of 5 Murders (this is high but just to read to the end). The 50 other people kill the other 95 percent. That means if one of ten whites kill someone, than every none-white kills 1.9 people.<br>
Just mathematics 1.9/0.1=19. That means a none-white is 19 times more likely to kill somebody than a white would do.</p>

<p>I am suspicious of Wiki&rsquo;s figure of NY City as &#8220;31.5% Non-Hispanic White.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the <i>laughable</i> stats Wiki reports about Los Angeles:</p>
<p>White: 49.5% (Non-Hispanic Whites: 29.4%)<br>
Black or African American: 9.9%<br>
Hispanic or Latino (of any race): 48.4%</p>
<p>I do not believe for one second that Los Angeles is 29.4% White.</p>
<p>Some sites report Euro-Americans comprise 11% of LA&rsquo;s population which my own eyes tell me is far more realistic than 29.4%, but, if I had to guess, just by looking around (I regularly travel across Los Angeles, stem to stern from the mountains and valley to the ocean, to all points N, S, E, W   &mdash;    with my car doors locked, of course), I would challenge the 11% figure as too high. </p>
<p>As for stupid TV shows, we now have Law &amp; Order:  Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer gives this preview:</p>
<p><i>The Wednesday, episode &#8216;Sylmar&rsquo; will explore the national security threat posed by&hellip;blue-eyed, blonde Americans who espouse extremist Islam and have enough explosives to &#8216;Blow up Staples Center!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Blond Blue-eyed Americans in SYLMAR? Ha Ha Ha!</p>
<p>Steve Sailer is a native Angeleno, as I am, and knows the premise is beyond ridiculous.  Guess NBC figures there aren&rsquo;t enough TV viewers out there who are familiar with the demographics of Sylmar (an hispanic, Section 8, gang-infested hell-hole). </p>
<p>As Steve puts it:</p>

<p>I agree.  While it is never admitted in direct terms, the North&rsquo;s determination to prevent the extension of slavery (into new territories) was also a determination to keep out blacks and keep those areas white. The South wanted to extend the curse of slavery, which in other words meant spreading the curse of blacks. Wherever Southerners went, they took slavery (blacks) with them.</p>
<p>So what do you say to that, Belle?  Your addiction to slaves is what we are all paying for today. That cotton and tobacco and sugarcane has proven to be mighty expensive.  You should have picked your own.</p>

The stark contrast between reality on the ground and the way it is portrayed in the media is a source of much anger.  It is also the reason so many young, naive whites have been murdered; they have no clue that crime levels are so different among whites/Asians compared to NAMs.  Unprepared as they are, they are easy prey.

<p>Actually, with the rise of steam powered agro and the depletion of Southern soil to King Cotton&rsquo;s constant ravaging, the only thing that is assured by slavery or the Civil War is that the British will bring Egyptian Cotton to the fore by 1900, regardless.</p>
<p>Had the North taken the same route as the UN does today (which is to say: forever), black enslavement would have likely ended by the 1880s and then the irony would be that fleeing black free men were being chased down and put on a boat back to Africa or (assuming we could swing it with the locals, who wanted no part of them) the Panama area, initially to mine coal.</p>
<p>The coal was terrible in quality.  All the surrounding governments threatened to meet the first boats who tried with armies.  And Lincoln, in the wake of the war, could not fund a massive transportation of blacks to Liberia, his first, 1840s, choice.</p>
<p>The one repatriation effort which he supported, by contract, to Haiti, ended when the white man Bernard Kock, absconded with the money, leaving the 500 odd colonists to starve and nearly be killed off by smallpox and incompetence, until rescued by the USN, less than a year after arrival.</p>
<p>If we did such a thing today, it would be called mass murder.</p>
<p>Every great society has enslaved something as a base=free advantage.  Be it the sun to escape an Ice Age, the sea for a constant food and transport source or irrigation to make better use of a Nile flood.  Even whites enslaving other whites to manage the day to day elementals of their existence (teaching their kids, managing their farms, doing their accounting) so they could sit back and &#8216;think big&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Black Slavery powered agriculture built the non-industrialized South at a time when the North _could not_ sustain the nation on fish and early industry.  Cotton kept it beautiful and agricultural.  Provided much of the population base which settled the West rather than live in the ruins of post bellum depression.  White Slavery (post 1900 industrialization) gave us such wonderful bergs as Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit.  And oh yes, Washington D.C.  Capital and Sewer of our nation.</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder which was worse?</p>
<p>The sad fact is that we are STILL _directly responsible_, as consumers, for allowing companies from Dell to Boeing to Gap to Nike to either send their manufacturing overseas to slave factories in places like Indonesia where workers are paid a dollar a day for 16 hours shifts, standing on their feet.  Or by bringing in underqualified Asian engineers to replace highly skilled whites in professional trades.  For half the salaried H1B cost.</p>
<p>If we didn&rsquo;t live by &#8216;the bottom line&rsquo; of what the government (Fed) says the market will bear, if we returned to a regulated society that guaranteed whites the same kinds of salary guarantees, regardless of skills, that minorities now have and made private corporations directly responsible (legally, criminally) for the full extent of their &#8216;global enterprises&rsquo; so that it actually paid them (thermodynamically distributionist capitalism is a total fraud) to keep their work _here_, we would all be a lot better off.</p>
<p>And the starting point for that discussion is advanced, anthropomorphic, robots.  Because if a rich man can enslave a poor man to the _process_ he owns.  Then a poor man should be able to enslave the wealthy to the work _product_ that is that process, made effective.</p>
<p>We are headed for a world in which &#8216;fairness demands&rsquo; we earn 10,000 dollars a year so that everyone else can have their bit of the social welfare pie, even beyond our borders.  But if you were honest about the realities of slavery you would see that 5X10,000 worth of labor when you only had to pay ONE MAN the resultant profits, is still a 50,000 dollar a year job.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what robotic labor really means.  The end of being ashamed for doing grunge work.  The end of listening to the lie of Mexicans doing a job we won&rsquo;t, for half as much.  The end of blacks pretending they deserve everything because they are good at nothing.</p>
<p>Own the work product and the process collapses without it.</p>
<p>Every poor white child should receive as a gift, the ownership of one robot&rsquo;s work product on their first birthday.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t you doubt, if the conniving monsters who run this country have their way, we&rsquo;re all about to become _very_ poor.</p>

		<p>I seem to have stirred up a bit of a hornet&rsquo;s nest here. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Southerners are in deep denial about their responsibility for giving America today its black problem, which is a legacy of slavery. Its all very simple. The south had slavery. The slaves were blacks. Blacks today are the descendents of those slaves. Thus it is the souths&rsquo; fault - no matter how much southerners try to rationalize it or shift the blame away from themselves.</p>
<p>To Sardonicus: You can&rsquo;t be serious. For every slave in the north there were DOZENS in the south. Slavery was a novelty in the north and didn&rsquo;t last. It was normal and routine in the south.</p>
<p>To Courtney: The whole country &#8220;supported&#8221; slavery?!? It just &#8220;ended up&#8221; in the south??? (SOURCES??) Gosh wasn&rsquo;t that nice of those southern slaveowners to take one for the team. I guess that&rsquo;s why slavery was abolished in state after state in the north but NEVER in the south. I guess that&rsquo;s why there were no abolitionist movements in the north and no civil war to end slavery huh Courtney? </p>
<p>Even if we accept that slavery existed in the southern states that border the Atlantic PRIOR to 1776, what about all the states that the south converted to slavery afterwards and brought slaves (blacks) into? It certainly wasn&rsquo;t the north! Who introduced slavery into Alabama, Louisiana, etc? Southerners. The north brought free states into the Union. The south always tried to make a new territory slave and would only allow a free state into the union when it could balance it by admitting a slave one. Look how the south tried to spread slavery into Kansas (&#8216;bleding Kansas&rsquo;) for example. Who is more to blame for slavery, Maine or Mississippi? Iowa or Alabama? The south had slavery, practiced it widely and did everything it could to spread it as far as possible. So I say again it was all the south&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>Actually, it was England and BOTH the North and the South that gave us slavery. At the time slavery first began, the USA was not a country but a colony of England, which was heavily involved in the slave trade at that time, wanting slaves for their colonies. Slavery first began in the colonies up North, in the state of Massachuesetts, and most slave traders were actually Northerners. In the mid-18th century, half of New York City was made up of slaves. However, as the North became industrialized, slavery was phased out while it still continued in the South, because the South was much more agricultural. Well, the rest as they say is history. However, I think blaming people today, North or South or England is ridiculous because people today have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>The North didn&rsquo;t discourage slavery after colonial times.  It wasn&rsquo;t until they no longer needed slaves that they gradually ended slavery and got rid of their slaves by selling them  to the South. The North did it gradually so as not to disrupt THEIR economy and sold the slaves to the South instead of freeing them or sending them back to Africa so they wouldn&rsquo;t lose money on them.</p>

<p>First of all, about 95% of all Southerners did their own agricultural and other work so stop the nonsense that Southerners were &#8220;addicted&#8221; to slaves. Few Southerners had slaves as they could not afford them. Only about 5% of the elite plantation  owners wanted their slaves.</p>

<p>And it remains a fact as well that the Southern STATES not only supported slavery but wanted to EXTEND slavery (meaning blacks) into new territories all the way to California.</p>
<p>No matter how many people did or didn&rsquo;t own slaves, they all supported slavery, didn&rsquo;t they?  What abolition movements existed in the South? <br>

<p>SOMEBODY IN THE SOUTH sure owned the slaves! There were over four million of them by 1861 in the south. The north began ending slavery as early as 1777 (Vermont was the first state to do so) and by 1804 it was eliminated altogether. In contrast the south never made any effort to end slavery or even to convert it to serfdom. The south created slave state after slave state. Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas were all brought into the union as slave states because of the south. It was the SOUTH, not the colonial overlord Britain, that was responsible for this. The south tried to spread slavery everywhere, even into places like Kansas for instance. In 1830 the price of a &#8216;prime field hand&rsquo; was $500. By 1860 this had risen to $1,800. This shows how vital slave labour was to the south. If the south wasn&rsquo;t to blame for slavery who was? The Pacific northwest? The Rocky mountain states? The Plains states? The upper midwest? New England? No it was the south that is to blame. </p>

<p>The South was partly to blame of course but you forget that slavery was inherited by both North and South as they were both colonies of England which was heavily involved in the slave trade at the time. The North did continue slavery  after independence from England only until it was no longer needed. Only when it was no longer needed did they stop it, so to say that the South was solely responsible for slavery is nonsense, the UK and the North were too. Later on, during the industrial revolution, the North helped to build industry on White child labor whose conditions were horrible. The South continued slavery because it was beneficial to the Southern elites and they held the power.  However, NOBODY today be it the British, the North or the South, is responsible as people today have NOTHING to do with it.</p>

<p>Yes, the wealthy did own those four million slaves but as I said about 95% of Southerners did not own slaves. Since the politicians and elites were the ones who owned slaves and had the power,they made the rules. Most White Southerners were poor and that society at the time was still based on an old European feudal society of extreme wealth and poverty.</p>

		<p>#47-(I seem to have stirred up a bit of a hornet&rsquo;s nest here. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Southerners are in deep denial about their responsibility for giving America today its black problem, which is a legacy of slavery. Its all very simple.)</p>
<p>Nonsense. No Southerner on here or anywhere is saying that the old South didn&rsquo;t have slavery or try to spread it or didn&rsquo;t hold some responsiblity. What we are saying is that the South wasn&rsquo;t the only one responsible, the South didn&rsquo;t start slavery. As someone else pointed out, when most slaves were first brought to the North and South and slavery first began, neither region was in control of their own destiny as both were colonies of Europe. Northerners are in denial about the fact that they too had slavery, brought most slaves over and whatever decisions they made about slavery was for their own benefit period. Northerners also forget that later, they had &#8220;slavery&#8221; as children were forced to work long hours in factories with conditions that were so bad that the kids had a life expectancy of only 19!!!!  African slavery continued in the South simply because of the climate, it was agricultural and the fact that it was beneficial and child &#8220;slave&#8221; labor happened in the North simply because of the climate, it was industrial and beneficial to that region. Had African slavery been  beneficial in the North and the climate had been right there, it would have continued there. Simple as that. </p>

<p>No need to go that far. Just look at Vermont and Montana. Mostly White, low crime, and (unlike Europe) you can legally carry a gun.<br>

Ha!  I have to laugh at how some die-hard Southerners love to fling insults like the above in the face of Yankees.  Yet, when  the tables are turned on them, they quickly disclaim any involvement or responsibility for slavery.  When they are presented with statistics and facts, such as the South&rsquo;s insistence on spreading slavery (blacks) into new territories, then they come back with a a haughty <i>&#8220;I refuse to re-fight the war between the states!&#8221;</i>&hellip; and a further denial that they ever had anything to do with slavery anyway, since it&rsquo;s all long past.  </p>
<p>Well, did WE presently alive in the north have anything to do with it?  Isn&rsquo;t it long past for us also? Then why the insults?</p>
<p>By the way,  I recently read that even discussing abolition was illegal in the South. It was just outside the limits of debate, out of the question, unmentionable, forbidden. Maybe 95% of the population didn&rsquo;t own slaves, but everybody was going along with it.</p>

		<p>#57 &#8220;Why the insults&#8221; toward northerners? </p>
<p>Because the north&rsquo;s interference in Southern affairs, particularly those of a racial nature, have been devastating to the entire nation, ie. repealing of Jim Crow, forced busing (and we who knew better reveled at the outcry in Boston, the cradle of the abolitionist movement, when it finally reared its ugly and useless head there.) and all other laws in which blacks were controlled. We Southerners knew how to maintain law and order and did just that for a century after Appomattox. It was only when, yet again, the north began bawling its collective head at us in the 1960s about our &#8220;inhumanity&#8221; toward the blacks that our society became untenable.</p>

<p>You can say anything you want but the facts are that AFTER the Revolutionary war which ended British influence the south went on to create NINE NEW SLAVE STATES. The north did not create a single one. Had it truly just been Britain&rsquo;s fault, slavery would have just stayed in the original six states on the Atlantic coast. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t the north that was trying to extend slavery into Kansas. The fact is that the north moved to abolish slavery. The south never did at all. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the civil war when or how do you think slavery would have ended? As for the &#8216;child laborers&rsquo; the fact is that this dreadful practice has no legacy today in a racial problem like the issue of black slavery does.  </p>

<p>Even if I accept every thing you write here, the fact remains there would have been no Jim Crow or forced busing had there been no blacks. And there would have been no blacks but for slavery, which was a southern reality. I would have a lot more respect for southerners if they said something like; &#8220;I personally bear no responsibility for slavery or its aftermath but some southerners ancestors do and this historical reality is the root cause of our racial problems today by creating a large black community in America&#8221;. It is much better then snide comments about how southerners are so much smarter then naive, dumb people in the north. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll agree with you on that,  and I even sympathize.  Really, I do.<br>
And yes, that interference has ultimately been &#8220;devastating&#8221; to all of us.</p>
<p>But just consider:<br>
#1. There wouldn&rsquo;t have been any problem to fix in the first place, if the South hadn&rsquo;t clung to its black slaves and insisted on spreading the practice even further.</p>
<p>#2. Many of those &#8220;Northerners&#8221;  in the radical 1960&rsquo;s came from certain elements in a few large  Northern cities. They were NOT representative of ALL Northerners of that time, who generally wanted only to mind their own business and had nothing against the South   &mdash;  - although all Northerners seem to get the blame today.  Actually, nearly all of that agitation came from, and was led by,  persons from some very small minority groups with militant social agendas of their own.  They were not your typical &#8220;Northerners&#8221;.   Got it?</p>
