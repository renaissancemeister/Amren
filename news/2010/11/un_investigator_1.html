<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39961521/ns/us_news-life/">U.N. Investigator: Migrants Suffer Worst Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edith M. Lederer, MSNBC, November 2, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Migrants in Europe, the United States and many other parts of the world are subjected to the worst forms of racial discrimination and xenophobia, a U.N. independent investigator said Monday.</p>
<p>Githu Muigai, a Kenyan lawyer, said many other groups are also victims including ethnic minorities attacked because of their minority status, individuals stopped and searched because of their perceived religious or ethnic background, and soccer players insulted because of their color.</p>
<p>He reiterated his opposition to Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law because it compromises basic international human rights that migrants are entitled to.</p>
<p>Muigai, the U.N. Human Rights Council&rsquo;s special investigator on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, spoke to reporters after presenting reports to the General Assembly on efforts to eliminate these practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have found any specific group of people to be the subject of the most insidious contemporary forms of racial discrimination, those are migrants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think in many parts of the world today, immigrants bear the brunt of xenophobic intolerance  &mdash;  and this is true of the United States, and it is of Europe, and it is of many parts of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muigai said international law doesn&rsquo;t prevent any country from enforcing &#8220;a fair, open, transparent migration policy.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All I have been saying in my reports is that we need to develop systems, structures, and policies in an international legal environment in which we can address the legitimate concerns of the receiving states while being able to safeguard the fundamental humanity, in my judgment, of the immigrants,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Muigai said he is concerned that the Arizona law, now been challenged in a federal appeals court, &#8220;does not respond to minimum human rights standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He urged all countries to ensure that migration policies are &#8220;at all times consistent with international human rights instruments.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the issue of inciting racial or religious hatred, he said criticizing religious doctrines and teachings is a legitimate exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. But he expressed concern at violence and discrimination against individuals based on their religious beliefs, attacks on religious sites, and religious and ethnic profiling.</p>
<p>Muigai also stressed that no state is immune from extremist political parties, movements and groups with &#8220;a thinly veiled racist agenda, a xenophobic agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But he said he would hesitate to include the U.S. tea party movement, a coalition of groups which he said are trying to debate how government is organized and managed, with immigration policy just one issue.<br>

		<p>WE all know that nonwhites and migrants are the REAL racists, and they use this so they can get more White &#8220;guilt&#8221; heaped upon our naive and gullible White population. That way more concessions and freebies going to these migrants. Heaven forbid that Whites wake up to some truths and see that they are the real victims here.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s easy! If you want to stop &#8220;racism&#8221;, stop 3. world migration into white countries. But then the UN would soon put up an &#8220;out of business&#8221; sign. Which might not be a bad thing :)</p>

		<p>Who cares what the Useless Nations(UN)has to say. They need to butt out. First of all, speaking of Arizona,nobody has a human right to enter another country illegally. Mexico does not tolerate illegals in THEIR country, funny that the UN says nothing. If the USA or Europe is so &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; according, then these migrants should stay away, correct. Of course, it&rsquo;s not racist or xenophobic to not want illegal migrants or large numbers of legal ones pouring into the country. No 2nd/3rd world country allows it, why should the USA or Europe?</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I acknowledge no universalist &#8216;Immigrant Rights&rsquo; document or rights contained therein because I don&rsquo;t recall myself nor any agent of my government, empowered by my people, as having voted democratically to adopt such as part of our country&rsquo;s basic Constitution.</p>
<p>Our lands to run as we see fit.  Not yours.</p>

<p>Having no legal basis for your conceit, you contrive to create one the way all bureaucrats do: a false history of personal &#8216;reporting&rsquo; as paperwork.</p>

<p>We do not want you.  We find you to be physically ugly, mentally incompetent and morally hypocritous.  Why should we share in ours what you cannot develop on your own, in your own lands?</p>
<p>Indeed, HOW DARE YOU criticize our treatment of unwanted, often illegal, immigrants when you cannot even protect your own people, in 2008 no less?</p>

The ethnic violence that has killed more than 300 people since last Thursday&rsquo;s disputed presidential election has come as a shock for many here in East Africa&rsquo;s most stable and prosperous country.</p>
<p>It carries echoes of Rwanda&rsquo;s 1994 genocide in which more than 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in 100 days and it is prompting a flurry of diplomatic activity.</p>
<p>While President Mwai Kibaki and his populist rival Raila Odinga were accusing one another of stoking the ethnic strife, Kenya suffered its worst outbreak of violence yet on Tuesday. An estimated 30 Kenyans of the Kikuyu ethnic group – many of them children – were burned alive after taking shelter from a mob in a church in the western town of Eldoret.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at what happened in Eldoret, it&rsquo;s genocidal,&#8221; says Abdullah Ahmed Nasir, a political observer and former chair of the Law Society of Kenya. &#8220;It has echoes of Rwanda, and this could be the start of a wave of revenge. If people are killing Kikuyus because they are Kikuyus, then definitely it will spread elsewhere to other [ethnic] communities.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Not Rwanda?<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/2curczw" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2curczw</a></p>
<p>How about Darfur?<br>
https://tinyurl.com/22sazkl</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that here, thus you have no right to claim we are in violation of some specious perception of &#8216;human rights&rsquo; that is not yours to foist upon us.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Let&rsquo;s recall the origins of the 2007 violence: On December 27, 2007, Kenya held presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections. While the parliamentary and local government elections were largely credible, the presidential election was seriously flawed, with irregularities in the vote tabulation process as well as turnout in excess of 100% in some constituencies.</p>
<p>Despite this, on December 30, the chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared incumbent Mwai Kibaki, an ethnic Kikuyu, as the winner of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Violence erupted in different parts of Kenya as supporters of opposition candidate Raila Odinga, an ethnic Luo, and supporters of Kibaki clashed with police and each other.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2008, under international pressure, President Kibaki and Raila Odinga signed a power-sharing agreement, which provided for the establishment of a prime minister position to be filled by Odinga and two deputy prime minister positions, as well as the division of an expanded list of cabinet posts according to the parties&rsquo; proportional representation in parliament.</p>
<p>In other words, the two sides papered over their differences and opposition leaders agreed to be bought out. </p>
<p>And bought out is no exaggeration. In a country with 40% unemployment, where 50% live under the poverty line, government office is a route to riches. Salaries and alowances are enormous for members of the cabinet and Parliament.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the official pay.</p>
<p>As Human Rights Watch has reported: &ldquo;Kenya has a history of widespread corruption and systemic abuse of office by public officials&hellip; Political contests have become all the more charged because of what is at stake; those who achieve political power benefit from widespread abuses including&hellip; criminal theft of land, and the corrupt misuse of public resources &mdash; indulgences which occur at the expense of groups who are out of power.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Your skills are needed at home.  Go there.  Build a nation from your &#8216;diverse&rsquo; tribes of peoples.  Remove the mass fraud from your own government as a deliberate act of contempt against not one but -every- group, not actually in power.</p>
<p>If you can.</p>
<p>You have no moral authority to judge us here.</p>

		<p>Kenya! Isn&rsquo;t that the place just recently where they had about a thousand [1,000] persons hacked to death with machetes during a &#8220;disturbance&#8221; between tribes? And another HUNDRED THOUSAND [100,000] FOLKS had to flee their homes for their lives? Isn&rsquo;t that right? I think so.</p>
<p>Devoted readers to the forum, ask yourself where exactly the hate and xenophobia is! I think we know.</p>

		<p>You knew I&rsquo;d say this, but I&rsquo;ll say it anyway, these poor people that are getting their &#8216;feelings hurt&rsquo; in the Western countries that accept them in and provide for them (at the expense of the taxpayer) can go back to their homelands, where hopefully there is a lack of racism and xenophobia. Which then begs the question why they had to leave their homelands in the first place&hellip;<br>
I&rsquo;d say occasionally getting one&rsquo;s &#8216;feelings hurt&rsquo; in a Western country is probably a lot better than living in a third worlder where you&rsquo;re likely to get your hand chopped off, imprisoned without trial or even raped in the midst of a bizarre military campaign. Nothing is ever good enough for them, is it?</p>
<p>Muigai, the U.N. Human Rights Council&rsquo;s special investigator on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance&hellip;</p>
<p>Wow! How do you get a job like that? Getting paid a great deal more than the average wage for doing basically nothing.</p>

		<p>Third World countries, such as Mexico and Malaysia, usually have draconian immigration laws and are unembarrassed about enforcing them.</p>
<p>One could easily draw up a list of countries that people are eager to enter and another of those countries that people are eager to leave. </p>
<p>Inevitably, some countries would qualify twice; many Chinese are eager to leave China for a brighter future elsewhere yet thousands of desperate North Koreans, citizens of the wretchedly-poor yet nuclear-armed D.P.R.K., risk their lives to seek refuge in more-prosperous China.</p>
<p>Equally, hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis seek to emigrate to First World countries, while the wretched Muslim Biharis, unwillingly marooned in unwelcoming Bangladesh as the human flotsam of the Bangladeshi Independence War four decades ago, aspire unavailingly to be welcomed into Pakistan as Pakistani citizens.</p>

		<p>Cry me a river! These parasites (immigrants) insist on thrusting themselves into countries where they&rsquo;re not wanted. Then cry and feel sorry for themselves because the nasty old natives make it clear the immigrants are unwelcome. Being, after all, the newcomers are seen with great justification as a constant source of crime, social problems, even as life-long parasites depending on public tax money to support them and their progeny.</p>

The above is not true, as clearly the worst forms of racism and xenophobia are in evidence in Africa where they regularly rape, mutilate and kill each other.<br>
Immigrants into Europe and the US have spoken unequivocally through their action. Racism is not so high on their list of wrongs that it outweighs the benefits of personal security and opportunity in the adopted society.  <br>
The UN should read Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy, it will help the UN chose its issues more effectively.<br>

<p><br>
You are absolutely right about that.  Mr. Githu Muigai, <i>&#8220;the<br>
the U.N. Human Rights Council&rsquo;s special investigator on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance&#8221; </i>should begin by investigating his own Kanya, where tribes  regularly attack and kill members of other tribes  <i>by the hundreds. </i> Yet, he is more worried about the spectre of &#8220;racism&#8221; in white, western countries.  (When was the last time we have had a mass slaughter of blacks?)</p>
<p>It seems that one verbal slur or one perceived slight to a black &#8220;migrant&#8221; in a white country is considered more horrible, more outrageous, than the mass murders, &#8220;necklacing&#8221;, hacking off of limbs, rapes,  etc. that regularly take place in African countries. In other words, when blacks do it to other blacks it is glossed over as no big deal, just blacks being black; but when whites even use the wrong WORD to an overly sensitive black, that is an international outrage that requires UN  intervention.</p>
<p>Talk about a double standard!</p>
<p><i><b>Kenyans burned to death in church: </b><br>
Thirty Kenyans including many children have been burned to death in a church, after seeking refuge from the mounting violence&hellip; a mob set fire to the church in Eldoret where many people from President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s Kikuyu tribe were sheltering. About 400 people were said to be taking refuge in the Kenya Assemblies of God church when the attack took place.  A pastor from the church told the BBC that many of the people were beaten before the building was set on fire.&#8221;  </i></p>
<p> <i>&#8220;many houses and businesses have been torched, and roads in and around the town are closed. .. local hospitals were struggling to cope with the high number of casualties. The Kenyan Red Cross said that at least 70,000 people have been displaced as a result of the unrest &hellip;<br>
   <br>
Alfred Mutua, spokesman for the Kenyan government, accused Mr Odinga&rsquo;s supporters of a systematic campaign of ethnic violence. &#8220;Odinga&rsquo;s supporters&hellip; are engaging in ethnic cleansing and they are not doing it in a haphazard manner, they&rsquo;re doing it in a very well organised, calculated manner&hellip; attacking in military precision,&#8221; he told the BBC World Service. </i><br>
