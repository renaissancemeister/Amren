			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, Center for Immigration Studies, November 23, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Census Bureau data collected in March of this year show that 13.1 million immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in the previous 10 years, even though there was a net decline of 1 million jobs during the decade. In contrast, during the 1990s job growth was 21 million, and 12.1 million new immigrants arrived. Despite fundamentally different economic conditions, the level of immigration was similar for both ten-year periods.</p>
<p>The report, &#8220;Immigration and Economic Stagnation: An Examination of Trends 2000 to 2010,&#8221; is online at https://cis.org/highest-decade. Among the findings:</p>
<p>* The March 2010 data show that 13.1 million immigrants (legal and illegal) have arrived in the United States since January 2000. This is the case despite two significant recessions during the decade and a net loss of one million jobs.</p>
<p>* Data collected in March 2000 showed one million fewer immigrants arrived from January 1990 to March 2000 (12.1 million), while 21 million jobs were created during the decade.</p>
<p>* In 2008 and 2009, 2.4 million new immigrants (legal and illegal) settled in the United States, even though 8.2 million jobs were lost over the same period.</p>
<p>* The new data indicate that, without a change in U.S. immigration policy, the level of new immigration can remain high even in the face of massive job losses.</p>
<p>* Immigration is a complex process; it is not simply a function of U.S. labor market conditions. Factors such as the desire to be with relatives or to access public services in the United States also significantly impact migration.</p>
<p>* Although new immigration remains high, the 2.4 million new arrivals represent a decline from earlier in this decade. In the two years prior to 2006, for example, there were 2.9 million arrivals, according to Census Bureau data.</p>
<p>* There was no significant change in legal immigration during the past decade. Although the number of jobs declined in the decade just completed, 10.3 million green cards were issued from 2000 to 2009, more than in any decade in American history.</p>
<p>* Illegal immigrants also continue to arrive, though prior research indicates that the number coming dropped significantly at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>* Among the states with the largest proportional increase in their immigrant populations over the last decade are Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Alaska, Mississippi, Arkansas, Washington, North Carolina, Maryland, and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Discussion: Some have argued that immigration levels are simply a function of labor market conditions in the United States. But the new Census Bureau data remind us that immigration is a complex process driven by many factors in addition to the economy. In 2008 and 2009 net job losses numbered over 8 million, and the immigrant unemployment rate doubled. Yet more than two million new legal and illegal immigrants settled in the United States in those two years. This does not mean the economy is irrelevant to immigration levels. Rather it means that many factors in addition to the economy impact the flow of new immigrants into the country. Such factors as the desire to be with relatives, political freedom, lower levels of official corruption, and the generosity of American taxpayer-funded public services are all among the reasons people come to the United States. These things do not change during a recession or even during a prolonged period of relatively weak economic growth, like the decade just completed.</p>
<p>Immigration has a momentum of its own. In 2000 there were already more than 30 million immigrants (legal and illegal) living in the country. This enormous population means there are social networks of friends and family who provide information about conditions in the United States to those back home. This in turn makes those in the home country more aware of opportunities in the United States and more likely to come. New immigrants often live with established immigrants who can help the new arrivals. Thus as the immigrant population grows, it creates pressure and opportunities for even more immigration.</p>
<p>Data Source: Unlike in past decennial censuses, the 2010 census, which will be released shortly, has no immigration questions. Thus it will provide no information about the nation&rsquo;s immigrant population. The Census Bureau data analyzed in this report are from the March Current Population Survey, also referred to as the Annual Social and Economic Supplement. The new data provide a first look at immigration for the decade just completed. In this report, we use the terms &#8220;immigrant&#8221; to mean all persons living in this country who were not U.S. citizens at birth. The Census Bureau often refers to these individuals as &#8220;foreign born.&#8221; The immigrant or foreign-born includes those in the country legally and illegally. Prior research indicates that some 90 percent of illegal immigrants are included in the Current Population Survey.</p>
<p>The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent, non-partisan research institution that examines the impact of immigration on the United States.</p>

California in the 80&rsquo;s tried to control the illegal immigrant population but its politicians and legal system told the public to get lost as presently in AZ.  Is this country lost forever due to brainwashing that whites cannot be the majority because it is bad?    </p>

		<p>At some point markets and other reactionary tabs will realize that an unemployment rate of around 10% is the norm due to immigration policies.  That realization will do some good, but the rate will increase because immigrants, legal and illegal will be allowed to keep crowding in.  Along the line somewhere, a breaking point will come.</p>

		<p>As long as the Feds, state and local governments make hand outs and subsidies available to immigrants, legal and illegal, to the point they can survive on them, they will continue to come. All at taxpayers expense of course. Another bunch of line item budget vetoes necessary to preserve our American culture and freedoms before the third world dissolves them away. A tragedy in the making continues unabated.</p>

		<p>Immigration policy of the present has become subservient to debts of the past.</p>
<p>The U.S. and most Western countries have mortgaged their futures against long-term growth.  Growth from productivity is failing to materialize; the only growth which governments can accurately forecast is growth from immigrants, whose consumption of commodities keeps markets buoyant.</p>
<p>In this scenario, something has to give.  Immigration is producing less returns, but governments have no other options. Like a drug addict trying to keep himself high, governments keep reaching for their next &#8216;fix&rsquo; of immigrants.</p>

		<p>I knew a farmer who had a very large pond that was loaded with fish. When I was a kid we were given permission to go fishing and it was great! We always caught huge bass, bluegill, and catfish. Unfortunately, this farmer was a bleeding heart and he started allowing just about everyone to fish in his pond. By the time I entered college the pond was trashed and there were no large fish left. I went there a few weeks ago and  I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. <br>
I suggest that you take this analogy and apply it to our current situation! The pond has been fished out!</p>

		<p>There are 4 million technology jobs in America, the number has been roughly constant for a decade. During that time we have imported six million Indians.  Last year we imported 350,000 of them on the H-1B visa. Most have falsified credentials and fake resumes.</p>
<p>Each one of the 350,000 throws an American to the street.  And we do nothing.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s strange&hellip;  For decades we have been told by most economists that immigrants pose a source of job creation, since they contribute to an increase in demand for goods and services, which in return boosts production and thus the number of jobs.</p>
<p>While it is true that a larger population requires more goods and services, those goods have been produced in the most popular outsourcing destinations such as India and China. Therefore, the increase in demand for goods creates more jobs in those countries at best, the American citizen doesn&rsquo;t get any special benefit, except of his tax money being swallowed by the newcomers.</p>

		<p>I just heard Donald Trump on Fox and Friends this morning. He had all the right answers about what&rsquo;s going on in this administration. I just wish there had been time to get his take on what to do about illegal immigration. If he has the same thoughts on it as he does about other things, I&rsquo;d vote for him. He&rsquo;s seriously thinking of tossing his hat in the ring. He bears watching, espcially if he&rsquo;s behind using every means possiblle to send illegals home. I&rsquo;ve been hoping for another Eisenhower who didn&rsquo;t hesitate to demand they leave. </p>

		<p>Today, Russia and China announced they are dropping the dollar as a currency in transactions involving their two countries. Soon, the yuan/ruble/rupee will outweigh the dollar in economic importance, as Asia reverts to the Asians.<br>
So, what does this mean?<br>
It means nonsensical mercies such as automatic citizenship and welfare will go away along with the budget deficit. This is because the USA will face a very hard choice: balance the budget or suffer hyperinflation. Dollars are not going to be soaked up by the Asians very much longer. And taxes will go up dramatically; so if you are an illegal and plan on screwing the system by getting services but not paying in, prepare to be deported. That, or participate in the food riots along with everyone else.</p>

		<p> We need to get immigrants here to work. We have fished out the women folk workers and have to keep those wages down and profits up. Don&rsquo;t worry Mr. 401K holder your stock will go up 25% of course the fact that you own a pittance means it will mean very little to you but we who own the majority of the stock will really benefit but you keep thinking the way you are we love you.</p>

		<p>They come as part of drug distribution rings and support for drug traffickers.  All the welfare they get is a nice bonus, but they&rsquo;re here to transport and sell drugs.  I work in the court system and I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.  Every mestizo who comes through the system is connected, either directly or indirectly, to drug distribution or its ancillary industries.</p>

<p> I am total agreement with this statement. They know that they can live better here on government handouts than they can in their own countries. And while they are doing it make the whites feel more guilt because of it.<br>
 This &#8220;white guilt complex&#8221; has to come to an end!!I wish I had the answers to why there is so much of it and how to rid the white race of this affliction but I do not. One thing I fear for certain: If the white race continues down this path; it will mean certain doom and possible extinction for all of us.<br>

		<p>Well why shouldn&rsquo;t they come? They can get free healthcare, free, or at least reduced cost housing, free schooling for their children that provides free breakfast and lunch, free food, free baby items, free free free all at the expense of the American taxpayer. The rest of the illegal&rsquo;s income can be put toward luxuries and wants like cell phones, computers, nice clothing and shoes, etc&hellip; None of us should blame the illegal for taking advantage of such a system. Who we should blame is the politicians, the corrupt businesses who hire the illegals, and the average lazy apathetic American who just sits back and let&rsquo;s it all happen.</p>

		<p>Some posters here have said repeatedly that if you cut off the jobs, the invaders will stop coming. That they will even go home!</p>
<p>That &#8220;solution&#8221; fails to see the entire problem.</p>
<p>It will help, I don&rsquo;t disagree. But it will not solve the problem. Jobs are not the sole attraction that draws them. There are still plenty of other opportunities here (even crime). Lack of jobs will merely lessen the flow, but not stop it. At any rate, conditions here are STILL much better than they were back home. You have to put a FIRM stop to it, and close ALL opportunities!</p>

<p>The people and organized pressure groups who wield  the clout behind the scenes   &mdash;   both politically, financially, and ideologically  (read academia and media)   &mdash;   do NOT want to see a majority white America.  They are determined to abolish it.  They see a white majority as a potential threat. that must be eliminated.    It is a fundamental item on their agenda. and they are going to pursue this goal resolutely, at any cost, no matter what.</p>
<p>Our system has been corrupted. It is not controlled by the American people but by wealthy individuals and pressure groups who allow us to vote on politicians that they have pre-selected, giving us the impression that we have a choice.</p>
