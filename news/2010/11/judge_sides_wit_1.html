<h1>Judge Sides With Muslim Group in State Question 755</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KFOR-TV (Lincoln, Nebraska), November 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that keeps a restriction against Islamic Sharia law out of the state Constitution for now.</p>
<p>In a 15-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange ruled in favor of an Oklahoma City Muslim who complained the new constitutional amendment would violate his religious freedom.</p>
<p>Oklahomans approved the amendment in State Question 755 with more than 70 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The amendment forbids state courts from using or considering international law or Islamic Sharia law in making decisions.</p>
<p>Muneer Awad, 27, quickly challenged the amendment, saying it demonizes his faith.</p>
<p>Awad is executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her opinion Monday means the Election Board is barred indefinitely from certifying the results.<br/>

						<p>The Oklahoma International Law Amendment was on the November 2, 2010 general election ballot in the state of Oklahoma as a legislatively-referred constitutional amendment. The measure would require that courts rely on federal or state laws when handing down decisions concerning cases and would prohibit them from using international law or Sharia law when making rulings.</p>
<p><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p>With the passage of the measure, Muslims in the state planned for action against the measure in court. According to reports, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Oklahoma would file the lawsuit, which will claim that the measure is unconstitutional. Muneer Awad, executive director of the group, stated that the measure is deceptive and misleads people into believing that there is a threat from Islam in the country. The lawsuit, according to Awad, had planned to be filed in federal court by as early as November 4, 2010. According to reports, the measure was indeed filed on that day, with Awad listed as the plaintiff. The complaint filed with the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma can be read here.</p>

It is not for an Arab or Asian to decide whether his presence is a threat. The founding people of the United States alone have that right.</p>
<p>Eastern peoples, by their very presence, are a threat. Their presence threatens to alter the fundamental character of the founding Western culture and race of the United States.</p>
<p>If we as a people choose not to use arms to defend our culture and territory from encroachment, it is because we choose to use law instead.</p>

<p>So Comrade District Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange, sees value in &ldquo;Islamic Sharia law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps, such laws should be applied to her, as the wretchedly feckless whore that she is? And what happens to wretchedly feckless whores under &ldquo;Islamic Sharia law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it being buried up to the neck in a pit and being stoned to death?</p>

		<p>I would question the judge on just what basis it is that she believes she derives her judiciary power.  It seems self-evident that a nation cannot have multiple, co-level, legal authorities, and hope to maintain itself as a nation in the long run.  Whereas hierarchical law is necessary, the judge here has single-handedly decided to say that U.S. law only applies to those who agree to follow it.  It may be worth noting that the judge is also African-American (and a Clinton appointee).  Could it be that she holds contempt for America in general, and so finds she can add her ruling to the anti-White, anti-Western, anti-U.S. liberal agenda?</p>

		<p>Dickwad, er that&rsquo;s Awad, can observe sharia law all he wants, as long as it does NOT supercede or contravene the law of the land, passed Constitutionally.  As this law was.<br/>
Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how many &#8220;she&#8221; judges come down on the side of liberal, anti-American, anti-Christian, pro-Islamic, pro-homosexual agendas through judicial activism.  Isn&rsquo;t it.  Unless, of course, it&rsquo;s a MALE (sort of) judge coming down on the side of homosexual agendas, while being a homosexual himself without the honor to recuse himself.  The sad thing is, they don&rsquo;t seem to realize what occurs when a society finally comes to the firm conclusion that the law of the land is no law at all, that justice has been perverted beyond recognition and there is no faith left in it anymore, and that when the people realize they rulers and courts view them with utter contempt and take every opportunity to thwart constitutional restrictions&hellip;.they take the only option left them.  Rebellion.  As judicial and government arrogance grows more intolerant, the fuze glows more brightly.</p>
<p>It IS possible to impeach judges.  Time we availed ourselves of that.  High time.</p>

<p>According to a federal judge&rsquo;s ruling which was unsealed just last week, CAIR is connected to terrorist organizations such as Hamas. CAIR also has also been linked to the Moslem Brotherhood whose stated objective is to impose worldwide sharia law. And there is also reason to believe CAIR has been fundraising in the US and using those monies to compensate the families of moslem suicide bombers / terrorists.</p>

		<p>When I see a Confederate monument, I pray to it the same way pagans pray to idols.  If a city tries to remove any Confederate monument, I can sue them for violating my religious freedom.  Why did we need to rely on the Muslims to protect us from the NAACP&rsquo;s extremist hate and dangerou rhetoric?</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Sharia Law does not recognize religious freedom. Hence, if the judge took account of it in her decision, she could not have ruled in favor of the Muslim. That issue aside, I am having a hard time understanding how the amendment prohibits the free exercise of religion. The courts are not allowed to consult the Bible when it comes to issues of fornication, idolatry, homosexuality, and divorce but that fact in no way (that I am aware of) prohibits me from practicing my Christian faith. If it does, then maybe I should take a cue from this the Oklahoma City Muslim and file a lawsuit of my own. But I can&rsquo;t because I just remembered that being a Christian gets me on a list of members of hate organizations. </p>

		<p>Actually, what is tripping up Prop 755 is the way it tries to backdoor a shield against supranationalist takeover of the United States as soon as they have successfully debased it enough.</p>
<p>&gt;<br/>
International law is also known as the law of nations. It deals with the conduct of international organizations and independent nations, such as countries, states and tribes. It deals with their relationship with each other. It also deals with some of their relationships with persons.<br/>
&gt;</p>
<p>WTO, IMF, World Bank, EU, NAU.  Get the picture?</p>
<p>&gt;<br/>
The law of nations is formed by the general assent of civilized nations. Sources of international law also include international agreements, as well as treaties.<br/>
&gt;</p>
<p>i.e.  Those laws which can be created without resort to Constitutional Amendment because, guess what, no one in their right mind would assign a businessman or lawyer the right to reframe our system of jurisprudence to reflect, what was good for Corporate and International Consortia Interests over our own.</p>
<p>What 755 represents is ultimately a counter to international agencies attempts to limit their liability to fraud, commercial or otherwise.</p>
<p>So when you are: invaded, assaulted, mauled, poisoned, enslaved, overworked, starved, or infected by a given agency and -live- to scream loudly about it, they can point to a piece of paper and say: &#8220;This is all we owe you.&#8221;  And when you say that that&rsquo;s unconstitutional and you don&rsquo;t recognize it, they will tell you &#8220;But your duly appointed representative did.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such is the real danger of Republican Rule.  It&rsquo;s like joint signage on a bank account.  If they can corrupt the upper tier, they can get -them- to sign off on whatever it is YOU agreed to empower them to do.</p>
<p>And you will never know about it, until it is too late.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Sharia Law is Islamic law. It is based on two principal sources, the Koran and the teaching of Mohammed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is to say that it is not &#8216;International&rsquo; Law.  Which is the balancing protection.  If it is regional and religious, then International Law doesn&rsquo;t have to bow to it anymore than they do to our Constitutional Mandates.</p>
<p>Because the majority of civilized nations don&rsquo;t follow the &#8216;business plan&rsquo; that Islam makes of pillage, rape and sadism.</p>
<p>Islam is, as always, the moron brigade.  The brownshirts sent in to soften up and isolate the the decent while the real work of destroying our country is done much higher up the food chain.</p>
<p>Prop 755 was an attempt to associate the tool with the user and thus guard against both.  It will fail because the user will not allow a law that supercedes their own laws.</p>
<p>Which is why Federalism is itself evil because this should never be a part of the circuit process.  It belongs solely to the States to determine which laws beyond those delineated in the Constitution are to be recognized.  Just as it -should- belong solely to the States to decide which racial and religious groups are dumped on them with their associated cultural deficits.</p>
<p>Our own government has drunk the Kool Aid.  They are onboard with selling us out to a supranationalist OWG.  And they are setting us up for a war of monumental proportions when their betrayal of our interests destroys not just the country but the organizations which are pushing this cosmopolitan pandemic.</p>

<p>Yes Bill but you must realize that if we give them the freedom to observe Sharia law then they will eventually supersede all of the above. They consider themselves above the rest of us and their numbers are increasing every day. After Sept 11 they seemed to come out of the woodwork and DUBYA invited them to the White house and kissed their collective Gluteae Maximae. They&rsquo;ve been streaming over the Mexican border unchallenged and proficient in Spanish. Does anyone really believe the government&rsquo;s official tally of the number of Muslims any more that we should believe that 12% of the population figure for Afros? </p>
<p>They are overwhelming us by sheer numbers while some people on this site obsess constantly about Jews. </p>

		<p>The judge&rsquo;s ruling is unconstitutional, because the one of the Federal government&rsquo;s duties is to guarantee to each of the states a republican (small &#8220;r&#8221;) form of government.  That means no Sha&rsquo;ria foolishness as part of the official legal system, and it is also the reason why Louisiana must not use Napoleonic Law in its criminal procedure, even though it can and does use it in civil law.</p>
<p>This ballot measure is merely Oklahoma abiding by the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing to itself a republican form a government so the Feds don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
