<h1>Scotland Yard Spends Nearly £187 Million Pounds Trying to Control Black Gun Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP News, Nov. 15, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scotland Yard spends the vast majority of its £450 million &#8220;equality and diversity&#8221; budget paying for a special unit which tries to control black gun crime while police forces across the country are too poor to use their radio systems, it has emerged.</p>
<p>According to official Met figures, the vast majority of the £450 million &#8220;diversity fund&#8221; is, in fact, spent on officers and staff who work with &#8220;minority communities&#8221; and research issues such as black-on-black gun crime.</p>
<p>Other expenditures covered by the &#8220;equality and diversity scheme&#8221; include &#8220;community service units, safer schools initiatives and rape investigations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money includes £5 million for &#8220;training&#8221; officers, which entails an obligatory two day &#8220;community and race relations training course&#8221; for officers and frontline staff or a one day course for non-frontline staff.</p>
<p>During their first two years of service, all officers have to attend a four-day course on diversity.</p>
<p>This programme involves discussions with the Afro-Caribbean, Asian, homosexual, bisexual and transgender communities and includes &#8220;discussions on faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Met spent six percent of its last year&rsquo;s budget on &#8220;equalities-related expenditure&#8221; and nearly £450 million over the past three years on &#8220;recruitment, training and research within minority communities, as well as crime fighting and prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been revealed that police officers have been told to send texts rather than speak on their radios because many forces cannot afford to pay for the use of their communications systems.</p>
<p>Apparently the Government forced all police forces to &#8220;privatise&#8221; the radio communications network a while ago.</p>
<p>The lucky company to acquire this contract is named Airwave Solutions, and it charges each constabulary a flat fee for a pre-determined amount of air traffic per  month.</p>
<p>If the volume of traffic exceeds that predetermined level, the constabularies are charged excess fees, which one report claims are as much as £2 per second.</p>
<p>As a result, police officers are being sent on &#8220;texting courses&#8221; so that they can use their mobile phones to communicate with their headquarters and each other rather than use the radio systems.</p>

		<p>You present this article as if this is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Britain has increasingly become an anti-white banana republic.  Serious criminals go free while whites who express politically incorrect views, usually rather minor, face serious persecution, sometimes violence, sometimes incarceration, at the hand of police.</p>
<p>Hearing that they are basically being defunded in white areas is wonderful news.  Even better is that the lions share of funding is being sent to non-white neighborhoods to prosecute non-whites.  Even though serious brainwashing is being done to these police, do you really think that will hold in face of the reality of dealing with non-whites?</p>

		<p>Why is gun crime a problem in the UK? Guns are tightly regulated there, and handguns are mostly illegal. Why then does &#8220;gun crime&#8221; pose a problem? Or even exist?</p>
<p>Also, what are the chances the root of the problem will be determined to be &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; or &#8220;lack of diversity&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Apparantly none of this frivolous diversity fund money spent on the usual nonsense came under review in the recent austerity measures undertaken by the British government. But the cuts probably won&rsquo;t be enough over time, so maybe next time around some people with more sense in their heads might decide it&rsquo;s time that diversity is unaffordable. Let&rsquo;s certainly hope so. As it is, the money is wasted and does not make any real difference anyway, at least for white people.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that the &#8220;homosexual, bisexual and transgender communities&#8221; are not meeting in the same room, or rooms, as the Afro-Caribbeans and Asians.</p>

		<p>Privatizing is just code for firing all the government workers who used to maintain these systems, then replacing them with contract labor from India.  And hope for the best!<br>
 <br>
All over the US this plan is falling apart in HUGE ways for governments and businesses.  They&rsquo;re learning the hard way that cheaper and better can&rsquo;t exist in the same vacuum.<br>

		<p>Any further proof needed that the UK is probably so far down the liberal sewer that, baring a highly improbable miracle of some sort, it is beyond recovery?  Worse yet, is the obvious fact that the USA is next on the chopping block. Take a good look, people, at what brainless liberalism has brought to your doorstep. </p>

		<p>Maybe the police should just withdraw from the black neighborhoods out and hope the gangsters shoot each other.  </p>

		<p>In the UK blacks have handguns and are very criminal.<br>
No way!</p>
<p>That must be only in Britain like that because in the rest of the world, blacks are known for peace and academic degrees.</p>

		<p>  The article appears to confirm the old cliché that &#8220;if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.&#8221; Great Britain is far more violent today than when guns were legal back before WWII. I wonder what is the difference between then and now?  Maybe, the BNP has the answer.</p>

		<p>According to the book Guns and Gangs  &mdash;  Inside Black Gun Crime, by former BBC home affairs correspondent Graeme McLagan, black gun crime is a &ldquo;hugely unreported but important modern-day problem - an expensive problem both in terms of money and young lives. &ldquo;After terrorism, the single greatest worry for law enforcement agencies is gun crime, and in particular the so-called `black on black` shootings,&rdquo; reviews of his book said.<br>
According to his figures, black people are the victims of three quarters of the capital`s gun murders and non-fatal shootings. The shooters in 80 per cent of cases are also black. &ldquo;The real-life stories are even more shocking. Parents gagged and shot while their children cower under the bed, an innocent women shot for her flashy car, men gunned down simply for showing &#8216;disrespect&rsquo;,&rdquo; reviews of Mr McLagan&rsquo;s book read. Here is the full report, well worth a read to those in USA who think that the UK gun laws actually work or are enforced with vigour.<br>

<p>I know in France they had actual revolutions. Multiple ones, and yet nothing really changed as for the way things work. Women and &#8216;victims&rsquo; of color are changing our societies and workplaces for real. If you are white, police officials and important politicians don&rsquo;t have &#8216;discussions&rsquo; and roundtables with you. Police wont hold a &#8216;discussion&rsquo; with you. You don&rsquo;t have a &#8216;community&rsquo; either. Only a place that needs to be integrated. If you&rsquo;re white your just told to shut up or you will be arrested, oh, and that you are a powerful oppressor who needs to move aside.  </p>

		<p>Why should the UK be any different from any other place, when it comes to black on black gun crime? They&rsquo;ve passed strict gun control laws, just like California, South Africa and New York City have. Same old, same old.</p>

		<p>So in spite of the fact that guns have been very strictly controlled in the UK for 90 years or so, their criminal misuse remains a serious problem.  What does this tell us about the unworkability of gun-control laws and the impossibility of civilizing Africans?</p>
