			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrea Stone, AOL News, Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats alike insist it&rsquo;s time to stop piling debt onto future generations, yet political observers say the electoral clout of seniors may prove the biggest obstacle to reining in government spending. And just as in the 1960s, when many older Americans stood on the sidelines of the civil rights and women&rsquo;s movements, polls show seniors are the least enthused about allowing gays to serve openly in the military or get married.</p>
<p>&#8220;On social policy, we have a generation that consumes a huge portion of the federal budget yet doesn&rsquo;t approve of other Americans receiving benefits,&#8221; said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. &#8220;On cultural issues, there is a huge disconnect between retirees and much of the rest of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats got a shellacking on Nov. 2 in nearly every demographic group . But no group was as peeved at President Barack Obama and his party&rsquo;s priorities as voters over 65. Fueled by the tea party movement, which skews older and whiter than the general population, seniors voted for Republicans by a 21-point margin. </p>
<p>In 2008, elderly voters were the only age group to vote for Sen. John McCain in a year when young people turned out in force for Obama. This year, young people stayed home, giving seniors, who normally vote in high numbers anyway, even more say in the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really had a wave of the past, not a wave of the future,&#8221; said American University professor Leonard Steinhorn, author of &#8220;The Greater Generation: In Defense of the Baby Boom Legacy.&#8221; &#8220;This election did not represent the mood of the country. It represented the mood of the voters  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s a truly different demographic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama, the first African-American president, represents something older people &#8220;don&rsquo;t like culturally&#8221; and which encouraged them to come out en mass to vote, Steinhorn said. &#8220;The impact is that the voices of the younger generation, the future, tend to be washed over by the perspective of the older generation, people who are more rooted in the past&#8221; and more conservative positions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Older Americans weren&rsquo;t always so conservative or Republican  &mdash;  a recent Gallup poll found the most conservative members of the GOP are 55 or older. Many of the parents of today&rsquo;s aging baby boomers weren&rsquo;t so bothered by government spending. Many of them are dead.</p>
<p>The generation &#8220;whose identity was forged in Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal era  &mdash;  when many Americans saw the value of government in times of crisis  &mdash;  is being replaced by a generation of elderly voters who were moved by Reagan-era conservatism,&#8221; Zelizer said. &#8220;These elderly voters are still benefiting from the Roosevelt era, through Social Security and Medicare, so it makes these positions doubly striking and hypocritical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Center, said most of today&rsquo;s seniors &#8220;were socialized to politics during a relatively more conservative period of the late 1940s and the 1950s,&#8221; and that contributes to their world view.</p>
<p>Another factor is the homogeneity of seniors, he said. &#8220;Younger generations of Americans are much more racially and ethnically diverse than the older generation and, of course, diversity is related to political attitudes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gans said the concern and clout seniors show over economic issues doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t care about other generations or society as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their primary goal is to protect their own,&#8221; he said, but &#8220;there&rsquo;s selfishness involved with everybody. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s been a very long time since our politics had any sense of national duty or altruism.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Just for the record: &#8220;With age comes wisdom&#8221;.</p>
<p>After age 55 you can pretty much look back on years of experience and know pretty well where things are headed. There is a part of the brain that is tempered by so many experiences in life that you develop a clearer view of reality.</p>
<p>This article is full of the usual liberal propaganda. Change comes when it is ready.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be forced or imposed on people nor should the people be saturated with idealist propaganda that has no basis in fact.</p>

		<p>Actually, older people tend to be more conservative. To quote Winston Churchill, who also noticed this phenomenon, &#8220;If you&rsquo;re not a liberal at twenty you have no heart; if you&rsquo;re not a conservative at forty you have no brain.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;On social policy, we have a generation that consumes a huge portion of the federal budget yet doesn&rsquo;t approve of other Americans receiving benefits,&rdquo; said Julian Zelizer</p>
<p>  &mdash;  - I hope when Zelizer is old, and consuming a larger amount of money than a healthy young person, that he will voluntarily submit to ethanasia so a deserving non-white can get more free food stamps.</p>
<p>The dangerous thing about liberals is that for all their talk of &#8216;social justice&rsquo;, they pick and choose who gets that &#8216;justice.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>So older white people, who need medical care because they are old, should be castigated and denied government help.  </p>
<p>Even though they built the government that is supposed to help them, they should step aside for (mostly poor and helpless) immigrants, who came here BECAUSE of the social welfare programs and government spending and BECAUSE they were too pathetic and cowardly to work for justice in their own lands.  </p>
<p>Then, when they inundate our land, leaving less and less to spread around, they want to take more resources from a weak group (the elderly) to give it to the interlopers, who happen to be getting stronger and stronger.  Classic might makes right, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like social justice for the elderly doesn&rsquo;t count.  Liberals are hypocrites and they won&rsquo;t realize they are just as bad as what they criticize.</p>

		<p>We elderly Whites are faced with a shocking reality:  We worked hard and built families, neighborhoods, and institutions. Now, everything we built is being either given to the non whites or taken away from us by them.    We get distressed when we see our fellow Whites continuing to financially support colleges and universities that are dedicated to the vile, anti White hatemonger that promotes Rosa Liar Parks and Michael King Fake Reverend over our own great White heroes.</p>
<p>We contribute nothing to any organization that is not explicitly pro White. All others are scams and a theft of honesty, heritage, and honor.</p>

<i>Show me a young Conservative and I&rsquo;ll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I&rsquo;ll show you someone with no brains. - Winston Churchill</i></p>
<p>Despite the genocidal fantasies of Mr. Tim Wise, the death of a generation of old white people doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the end of conservative thinking.</p>
<p>Racial awareness isn&rsquo;t taught generation to generation. It&rsquo;s learned through experience.</p>
<p>I define my younger self as a passive liberal; someone who wasn&rsquo;t actively pushing social agendas but I was sympathetic to the alleged black plight (which was pushed on me at school and in the entertainment media).</p>
<p>As I got older, I heard the same excuses over and over. When those didn&rsquo;t do anything to change the black condition, an ever larger array of new excuses were proposed.</p>
<p>The younger generation may start out liberal because liberalism is our secular religion but liberals grow up and eventually get mugged by reality.</p>
<p>You can deny reality and make excuses for it but you can&rsquo;t make it go away.</p>
<p>Liberals grow up and when they do, they become conservatives.</p>

		<p>The continued using of the Military for social experiments always is a loser&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  Gays can do lots of things in the military besides assert their sexuality or lack of it.  Just as straights are taught that their sex lives are to be private unless you&rsquo;re looking for trouble..  This is an age old truth that won&rsquo;t be changed by new-agers or the young, newly indoctrinated.  </p>

		<p>This counry is so screwed up that it is impossible to get things right again like in &#8220;olden times&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, we should have never had social security, medicare, medicade, minimum wage controls, excessive taxation, government housing programs, mass immigration for the uneducated and lazy, etc.  These are all like Ponzi schemes destined to end in failure with the entire country going bankrupt.  And guess what, we ARE now bankrupt.  Bad for everyone.</p>
<p>  <br>
The greatest gift my parents gave me when I was a kid (and I&rsquo;m 73-years old now)was to not count on social security and other government programs for my income or retirement in my old age.   I was told these programs probably would not be around when I needed them anyway.  My parents were wrong on he timing since they are still here, but they were correct on the concept.  So, as a result, I forced myself to be a high achiever because I knew what was coming in the long run. Thanks parents.</p>
<p>However, even my parents could not visualize how the government would destroy the value of the dollar while sticking us with all kinds of taxes and inflation so that most of us would be forced to depend on government handouts later in life.  Even if one has a lot of money now, what good is it if the money has no value later (like think Zimbabwe).  I feel that I lived in the best time in history in the right place (the USA).  I was lucky.  Thanks ancestors.  This truly was the land of opportunity.  But nearly 100% of those of us my age feel that our grand children are really going to have it tough because of the government-mandated changes during our generation.  Thanks liberalism.</p>
<p>Yes, I use senior&rsquo;s benefits, but I would give them all away if I could reverse the system for the benefit of those who will follow me.   </p>

		<p>There is so much hypocrisy in this article I don&rsquo;t know where to start. The very first statement about seniors spending too big a share of government budget is a good place.  The old, white seniors that they are talking about gave their lives in 2 world wars AND filled the coffers of the American Government to the point where they were the richest country in the history of the planet. Now they have the nerve to say the seniors don&rsquo;t have the right to ask for their small share. The Democrats are angry because they are sucking more out of the system than they are putting in. I think the Dems dream of &#8220;the American Welfare State&#8221; is finally collapsing and they&rsquo;re absolutely unwilling to admit that their whole ideology is wrong.</p>

<p>This is simply a sanitized version of the openly maniacal Tim Wise&rsquo;s view of the world. It holds that older whites need to die off, so that &ldquo;social progress&rdquo; can be made. However, what drooling fools such as Comrades Keeter and Wise miss, is that whites who are not abnormally stupid or forever in a frustrated &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; adolescence, will never accept their version of &ldquo;social change&rdquo; and hopeless Marxism. </p>
<p>It all boils down to reality check politics by producers against the absurdities of the perpetually &ldquo;entitled.&rdquo; The people who are expected to support the system can only be abused so far before they react to protect themselves, in one way or another. The methods range from apathy to outright aggression against that system which feeds off of them.</p>
<p>The purpose of so-called multiculturalism is nothing more than the enslavement and eventual eradication of the white race, end of story.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take age and experience to figure that, only a functioning brain! </p>

		<p>Since 1980 the Republican Party has won elections by lying about taxing and spending. It is not possible to cut taxes, to continue to spend as much as the rest of the world spends on the military, and to balance the budget without making deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare.  <br>
 <br>
If you think it is a good idea to make those cuts, go to a Tea Party demonstration, give a speech advocating the cuts, and see what happens. Tea Party activists overestimate the cost of government spending programs they do not like, and disregard the cost of programs they approve of. Then they complain about high taxes and the national debt.     </p>

		<p>I, for one, am thoroughly sick and tired of the whining about &#8220;the greatest generation&#8221;.  What a load of malarky. This is the generation that gave us the civil rights movement, the immigration act of 1965, welfare, and raised the disastrous baby boom generation. </p>
<p>What, exactly, is so &#8220;great&#8221; about all that?  That they were ordered to go to war and they went?  Wow!  I&rsquo;m impressed. That they followed orders and massacred civilian populations in Germany (ie Dresden) and Japan (ie Hiroshima)?  Yeah, that&rsquo;s real heroic - at least if you consider murdering civilians heroic. That they fought for &#8220;civil rights&#8221;?  That they legalized the murder of unborn white children?  </p>
<p>The &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; died off in the early 1800&rsquo;s. Those men and women risked all to give us freedom from an oppressive monarchy. Calling the government loving saps who are elderly today &#8220;great&#8221; is nothing more or less than the standard media propaganda to make us believe that big government and it&rsquo;s endless entitlements is good for us. </p>
<p>This so-called &#8220;greatest generation&#8221; engineered, organized, and implemented the destruction of our once great nation. That they have the gall to now whine about how bad it&rsquo;s gotten is either proof of their stupidity or proof of their continued evil complicity. Without a doubt this was the Worst Generation and their hideous offspring in the baby boom are just continuing and carrying out the logical consequences of their Big Government creations such as Social Security, income taxes, the myriad of alphabet soup federal and state agencies, etc. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put the blame where it belongs. This country has gone downhill since Lincoln shredded the Constitution and killed hundreds of thousands of patriotic young men. But no generation has done more long term damage than the group we idiotically call &#8220;the greatest generation.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I, too, am annoyed with people over 40 who are liberals.  I think the liberal people who are middle aged who are angry because they can&rsquo;t accept the fact that socialism and multiculturalism don&rsquo;t work. If you are over the age of, say, 35 or 40 (especially) and you are still liberal, emotional, knee jerk, can&rsquo;t stand differences of opinion, don&rsquo;t understand how government really works, don&rsquo;t realize that you have to be responsible and work hard for what you want, etc, then you are really hopeless. </p>

I am 39, and I believe that that this is the case because older Americans have been able to witness the transformation of their country, since the JFK years. And they do not like the way America has changed. With good reason!</p>
<p>America is a country where the majority is being disposessed by visible minorities, people of color who are of lesser intellingence, and are more prone to violence.</p>

		<p>It is the seniors and before them that built this country that now others and third worlders are coming for the looting.  Most of these seniors worked for low wages = low savings rate.  Some MDs think that some of the seniors are destroying the Medicare system because they are over using it.  BUT those seniors are the customers; they are NOT the ones over changing and defrauding the system.  These MDs are angry over the Medicare pay cuts but yet it was NOT the seniors that abused the system by overbilling; by having most seniors take too many drugs; ordering/doing too many unnecessary procedures/therapies; too many unnecessary office visits, etc.  The Medicare system was originally found on this premise that the MDs/hospitals/suppliers would bill honestly but now it is an old fashioned idea when this country&rsquo;s morality was far different.  Very sad.    </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to read beyond the above quote. Those of us (of which I am one of US) object to those that have never paid into the system (even though those of us that HAVE paid were forced to do so) such as 40 million ILLEGAL invaders from South of the border, several hundreds of thousands of imported African muslims, hundreds of thousands of Indonesians, Pakistanis and such that are instantly put on welfare or other &#8220;public&#8221; assistance and again, have never paid into that system such as Obama&rsquo;s Auntie Zeutuni! I could have done better with my SS money than the gubmint has done by far! VAT, Fed EXCISE tax (when you buy tires) are all unregulated taxes (some here know more about that than I do, probably many do)I know I will never be a recipient of anything into which I have paid (I&rsquo;m the wrong color and religion).</p>

		<p>The Japanese and the Europeans are the only ones who have a lick of sense.</p>
<p>The first because they INVEST in the care of their elderly even as they ACKNOWLEDGE that they are too few and busy to do so themselves.  With robotics.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphic Robotics, as they transition from specialist functions like medical, into general industry and infrastructure support (something that humans are increasingly _too stupid_ to be competent at) are the one &#8216;pay nothing in, get something out&rsquo; means to reenergize both the economy and the individual.  Because they will function as slaves whose sum &#8216;earnings potential&rsquo; can be virtual in it&rsquo;s application to others.</p>
<p>The Europeans are wise because they have already moved something like 30-35% of the way towards independent electrical generation capacity.  Have the juice (wind and tidal farms around the coast) and the transition to an &#8216;electric economy&rsquo; as a function of transitioning transport and industry doesn&rsquo;t have a massive political interest behind refusal to change over.</p>
<p>As is, we can&rsquo;t even drill offshore without a wellcap blowout causing all other drilling rigs to be shut down.  More for the profit of Big Oil and Mideast Dependence, than the environment, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Some change is good.  Change which lets a seceded New America have a ready supply of non-brown labor and non-oil power is something that needs spending.  Socialized Medicine?  Not so much.</p>
<p>With regard to the elderly in particular, we need to compete with those who are buying up and starting up, wholesale, the small business end of the white employment spectrum.  Hotels, Apartments and Rental Properties, Laundries and Convenience Stores.  If I still had parents or grandparents the first thing I would offer them would be a place in my home so that they could afford a decent rider on medical.  And the second would be a _business plan_ to grow whatever capital we could put together.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the kind of **resource** we should be looking at our elderly as.  Not as a deficit.  But another adult who has grown up white and working with knowledge we haven&rsquo;t had time to learn yet.  Patience to help out with child rearing and transport to good schools.  And financial strength (low tax base if nothing else) to make ownership of a business workable.  When this country collapses, you won&rsquo;t be able to find &#8216;organized&rsquo; corporate employment.  _Anywhere_.  But small businesses may survive long enough to standup independent States with new currencies and new laws to protect us.</p>

		<p>Sometime ago, I read or heard that 60% of all medical dollars are spent during the last year of a persons life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall the percentage exactly but it was pretty high.  I will use 60% for this discussion.</p>
<p>There used to be a series on TV called The Paper Chase.  One of the instructors in the law school classroom scenes was played by the veteran actor, John Houseman.  Get his character in mind&hellip;recall how he leaned forward and spit it out.</p>
<p>For my rake, I will use Obama.  For my foil, Houseman.</p>
<p>Obama: &#8220;Did you realize that 60% of all health care dollars are spent in the last year of a persons life?  That&rsquo;s why we need universal health care.  To save all that money and use the savings on those more deserving.  We need Death Panels to determine who gets what dollars.  Why should we spend all that money on the elderly?</p>
<p>Houseman replies (leaning forward on his podium)hissing:  &#8220;BECAUSE THEY&rsquo;VE EARNED IT&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There is a HUGE difference between social security/medicare and welfare/medicaid.<br>
I, and many others, PAYED IN TO social security directly out of our paychecks with NO CHOICE, mind you.  For 50 or more years.  At one time there was a big SURPLUS in social security.  Guess what.  The Libtards raided that &#8220;trust fund&#8221; and drained it for programs it was never designed for, on things they could not get funded through Congress.  Medicaid and welfare were NEVER payed in to by the people habitually using it.  That is not a trust fund at all.  It comes from TAXES paid by ALL of we tax payers, and given to blacks and hispanics who have made a lifestyle out of never working, popping out kids for an increase in benefits, and then spending it on junk food, lottery tickets, and drugs.  I am sick and tired of the libtards calling Social Security an &#8220;entitlement&#8221; and equating it to welfare.  The only reason they do so now is because they want to hide the fact that they swindled and defrauded an entire generation or two through misappropriating and outright theft of a trust fund.  That should be criminal.  And it is.  Except the criminals are the law makers who hide their deeds buried deeply in bills nobody looks into.  Social Security would be FINE today were it not for three decades of theft by libtard politicians.</p>

		<p>If most old folks agreed with the cultural agenda of the left, it would hale us as with-it seniors who were an asset to society.  <br>
Apparently, there is nothing new under the sun in the repeated pattern of the young believing they have discovered something never before discovered.  The accumulated knowledge of the ages is somehow wrong in the view of many youth, and it typically takes decades for them to find the truth.  Nowadays, young folks tend to think that the sixties were the ultimate decade of social revolution, yet my mother always believed that the twenties were even moreso.  And it was the Roaring 20&rsquo;s that brought about the staidness of succeeding decades.  The societal pendulum swings in extremes, back and forth.<br>
As an oldster, let me give the young this sound piece of advice to ponder:  you will become me, in mind as well as body.<br>

		<p>As the population ages and faces retirement political changes will occur.  Older people can&rsquo;t earn what they once did.  They are increasingly dependent on the promise of social security payments.  The threat of having that diminished at a time when they have few income alternatives is real.  To protect themselves older people will vote against taxation and related non-elderly social services.  And they will support Social Security and medical benefits for the elderly.  This bodes for a rising political diviseness between the young and old, those who fell entitled becasue they did work, save and believe in the promises of retirement benefits against those that feel entitled but are capable of work.  Of course this will grow critical as there is an entire generation of folks that feel entitled without having worked.  And in an increasingly technological society with global competition, those without education and ambition will be unable to find good paying jobs.  An aging population with the prospects of poverty as they become increasingly infirm will become a voting block intolerant of able-bodied younger people unwilling to produce.  Its beginning now and it will become more obvious over time.  Further the US and the states are running out of debt capacity to support all its programs.  Reality begins when the money runs out.</p>

		<p>I am so tired of the ignorance that comes from the mouths of professors. Those of us over 55 remember a country that was prosperous and safe. We were not overrun by black and hispanic thugs. We did not have homosexuality and immorality shoved down our throats. We did not have diversity forced upon us, in fact our strength was a result of White Christian values. Drug usage was by a small minority. Our education system was the best in the world. Our economy was the world leader. Our military was unquestioned as the strongest. We contributed to the social security system our whole lives and watched as benefits were doled out to illegals and people who managed to scam the system with fake disabilities. Now we see the young generation who grew up with their face buried in a video game and want more of the above mentioned hope and change exerting influence on elections. We older White people need to vote and voice our opinions more than ever. If we don&rsquo;t our country and civilized society as we know it are doomed.</p>

		<p>We should only spend public dollars on the elderly and handicapped.  Just because a woman has a child out of wedlock does not make her poor, it makes her stupid, and we should not spend any money on her (other than to track down the sperm donor and make HIM pay up, not the taxpayer).  In other words no welfare for the able bodied.  Period.  </p>
<p>Want to save even more money, close down our overseas military bases.  Other than a few strategic bases to keep an eye on China, Iran and Russia close the 700 and some odd bases down and bring the troops home.  Put them on the border here.  We wouldn&rsquo;t need nearly so many troops and materiel.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in my early 40s and I can remember growing up in the 1970s and being fortunate enough to live as a young man in the 1980&rsquo;s, the last White cultural decade in America.  No, it wasn&rsquo;t the 1950&rsquo;s but the sickness of liberalism and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act hadn&rsquo;t at that time started to penetrate the core of America.  Anyone who is my age or older should be able to discern a decade by decade decline of this country and also be able to identify the problems causing it.  I fear for people in their 20&rsquo;s because they have no point of reference for what America really stands for.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Liberal&#8221; calls &#8220;to stop piling debt onto future generations&#8221; are so hypocritical.</p>
<p>While they seem to have no problems with taxing the (upper) middle class to teeth and to deprive us from such basic services like adequate enforcement of the law (and the border), separation of criminals from the society, and quality education (as opposed to indoctrination) of math, English, and science in public schools, they will never ever agree to stop subsidizing populations that collect various forms of welfare and other &#8220;free&#8221; public benefits and &#8220;entitlements&#8221; because of their &#8220;minority&#8221; status.</p>
<p>Stop redistributing our tax dollars among the so-called &#8220;poor&#8221; (remember, poverty and obesity are mutually exclusive categories), and big part of our national debt will melt, soon.<br>

		<p>Every so often there seems to be a push from the left to reduce the voting age here to 16 years.Obviously to get even more left leaning votes.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest a different approach. The initial right to vote should be earned.The voter must be doing something meaningful for society and show that they are a responsible person, not because he or she has just turned 18.The definition of meaningful could be anything to show that they are a responsible citizen. Examples, a successful high school education, or being in employment, even something as basic as working at McDonalds. Other basic qualifications for voting could be, bank savings, property ownership and responsible parenthood, like the mother who chooses to stay at home and raise her family, and of course being a taxpayer.</p>
<p>Think about it,it is not as draconian as it sounds,it would be just putting back some basic fairness in the whole system. After all, it is the responsible people in society who are working and paying for everything including the free ride that some 3rd world single mother of 8 is able to receive from (most) western governments.</p>

<p>Although the article emphasizes older, white Americans the usual suspects have no use for any white, conservative American, regardless of age.  I am sure they also disdain young, white military veterans who mostly vote conservative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger generations of Americans are much more racially and ethnically diverse than the older generation and, of course, diversity is related to political attitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But parse out the &#8220;Younger generations of Americans&#8221; and you find that the whites are still the most conservative voting group.  And the objective of the left is to eliminate whites the same way the Bolsheviks eliminated the counter-revolutionaries in the former Soviet Union.  There is precious little difference between then and now but the methodology.<br>

		<p>I think what is happening is white flight on a national level with whites concentrating their numbers regionally to maintain a majority.  Whites are fleeing California for Idaho, Oregon, and Utah.  The other strategy is to reduce the power of the Federal government so it is harder for the non-white dominated states like California and New York to feed off the whiter states.

<p>The &ldquo;Greatest Generation&rdquo; had little control over what happened. They thought that the media was informing them when, in fact, it was leading them. Back then it was very difficult to find opposing views, especially after Pearl Harbor when the America First movement collapsed. For decades there were only three television stations in major cities, which made molding public opinion easy. If they didn&rsquo;t like an idea, they presented only the weakest arguments for it or just ridiculed it. It is only with the Internet that informed dissent has become possible.</p>
<p>BTW, the quote about liberals turning conservative with age has also been attributed to Benjamin Disraeli. Winston Churchill borrowed most of his famous quotes from others.<br>

		<p>So, what&rsquo;s new. Young and old have had different opinions since the beginning of time. When you are young you assume that if you are in charge that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly make the same mistakes the last generation made. When you get old you understand that you may not make the same mistakes as the last generation but you do make just as many and that all change is not necessarily good because many times you end up jumping from the frying pan straight into the fire. </p>
<p>I can freely admit that my generation dropped the ball. We should have spent less time smoking wacky-backy and fighting communism overseas and more time fighting the communist here at home. </p>
<p>Sure we old white folks will die off in a few years and we will no longer be a problem but the war will not have been won because a new generation will come along with a completely new agenda and things will be as they have always been. No matter who you are you only get to stay on top for a short peroid of time and then someone younger and stronger comes along and takes your place as king of the hill. </p>
<p>The struggle for survival will continue until the end of time. </p>

		<p>WAAAA! So now we have another whining crying clueless liberal puke hypocrite ( Andrea Stone ) with a bunch of sour grapes because the Democrats got crushed in the November elections.  As a result he wants to blame it all on our elderly because this idiot claims they &#8220;consume a huge portion of the federal budget&#8221; and are behind the times. How pathetic is that? <br>
  These horrible people that Mr. Stone seems to hate so badly have had Social Security and Medicare taxes taken out of their pay checks their whole working lives and now that they are unable to work they have every right in the world to get some of that back. THEY WORKED FOR EVERY PENNY! Many of these people die and collect nothing at all.<br>
  These elderly folk that Stone likes to bad mouth are the backbone of this country. Many were immigrants that came here LEGALLY with just the shirts on their backs and two cents in their pockets but believed in the American spirit.  And that spirit was freedom. The first thing they did was learn the English language. Then they started at the bottom and worked their way up in whatever field they chose. Some became entrepeneurs and started their own businesses with a new idea or the improvement of an existing idea thus becoming a employer that hires many new people and eventually they become a large corporation. These people fought in our wars and salute our flag and wanted to part of America in every way.                <br>
   What a contrast to today&rsquo;s immigrants that come here illegally, break our laws, spit in out faces, desecrate our flag and fly their own, refuse to learn our language, refuse to assimilate into our society, suck down all the money they can get from our &#8220;give away programs&#8221; and send it off to their homeland, turn our borders into a garbage dump and criminal war zone and then they have the nerve to call real Americans &#8220;racist&#8221; because we object to what they are doing.  <br>
   So Andrea Stone needs to be concerned with more than just the elderly as there are millions more of us &#8220;real Americans&#8221; out there that refuse to let a bunch of liberal Marxist hypocrite idealists turn America into a third world cess-pool.  We have already seen this in the November election and this is just the beginning. All the voter fraud of Acorn, and all the voter intimidation of the Black Panthers, and all the money of George Soros is not going to help win the 2012 election because this time real Americans are going to fight back hard to make sure this nation is returned to what our founding fathers died for.       </p>

		<p>This is much more of a race issue than a generational conflict. The diversitoids couldn&rsquo;t care less about our white elderly because the two demographics share no blood or cultural ties. Indeed, the sooner whites die off, the sooner non-whites can finish usurping our civilization. Whites – young and old, men and women, middle and working class – need each other more than ever. If we supported each other a fraction as much as non-whites do, life would be immeasurably better for us all.</p>

		<p>This used to be a country of greatness, of the people, by the people and for the people until the people wanted change. You may critisize us old geezers and say we are not from the greatest generation but think about this? What was this country like in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s? I marched and protested for civil rights, and yes I am white. My uncle was at Pearl Harbor when it was bombed first by Japan, thus Hiroshima. If it weren&rsquo;t for Hiroshima we would all be slaves of Hitler. Now George Soros has taken over the plot to enslave us and make our money worthless. But our money sucking generation paid dearly for that Social Security, Medicare for years. Are we going to get that money back. Heck no. We were forced to give and now it is our turn to take because it was promised to us. That is simply the right thing to do. Quit using it for other things and there would be no problem. We worked hard, paid taxes, believed in this wonderful free country, sometimes we worked two jobs and more because we believed in the American Dream. Now all you Liberal upstarts young and naive want to blame everything on the people that put clothing on you, fed you and took care of you while you were playing your video games and driving your Chevy. Get real kiddo. Wake up. This country was great before your college professors shoved socialism down your throat and bashed your parents. And let me ask you this, what are you going to tell your mom and dad when they have a heart attack but the liberal care method says, too bad so sad. Bye mommy, thanks for everything. Can&rsquo;t help you. </p>

		<p>Oh, just you wait till the baby boomer retire, 90% white, and a real rainbow coalition below them, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ll see the rotten fruit of the sixties fall from the tree.  Non whites aren&rsquo;t going to forking over their paychecks for racist whitey without a fight.  I heard the chick from NPR licking her chops over the thought.</p>
