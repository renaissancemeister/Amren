<h1>Tide Turning Against Europe&rsquo;s Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Wilkinson, CNN, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They are cursed in cities and towns across Europe. On talk shows, in newspapers and in bars and cafes, they are dismissed as parasites, threatening social norms and culture. And when unemployment rises and governments impose cuts on public spending, the eyes turn again to the immigrants.</p>
<p>In France, once seen as a bastion of European egalitarianism, the issue of immigration and racial identity has shot to the top of the political agenda. Roma people, also known as gypsies, have been expelled under government orders, while the wearing of burqas and other Islamic face coverings in public is set to be banned.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy has been accused of engaging in Nazi-style ethnic cleansing over the expulsions while the European Commission has threatened to take legal action over the treatment of the Roma.</p>
<p>France isn&rsquo;t alone though. Across the continent, politicians and media commentators are adopting a harsh line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They argue that border controls must become stricter; that further large-scale immigration will damage overcrowded western societies and that any economic benefits of immigration are vastly overstated.</p>
<p>The reason for Europe&rsquo;s growing persecution of immigrants, according to Khalid Koser, from the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, is that in the current economic climate, foreigners are a useful scapegoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;At times of political crisis or elections, governments use migration as a lever,&#8221; Koser said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s what President Sarkozy is doing with the Roma expulsions in France as far as I can see.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a tendency to generalize migration that it&rsquo;s somehow a problem, that it&rsquo;s full of criminals, but that&rsquo;s just not the case. Many migrants are ex-pats returning from the U.S. for instance. Many others are Poles coming to work quite legally, as they have the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting thing for governments is how they&rsquo;ve lost control of this narrative. Even though they can prove empirically that most migrants are economic, are working and paying taxes, still certain parts of the media and a large part of the voting public don&rsquo;t get the message. I think it&rsquo;s a real concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Media commentator Roy Greenslade, a former UK tabloid editor, said little of the coverage of immigration in newspapers was objective.</p>
<p>&#8220;There appears to be a debate conducted in private among individuals and in public in newspapers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The private conversations are fed by gossip, rumor and innuendo, and by what appears in newspapers. The papers then repeat the gossip, rumor and innuendo until you get a self-perpetuating cycle in which one feeds the other. It means there is a lack of objective information.&#8221;</p>
<p>This situation could only be rescued, Greenslade added, &#8220;if someone at the highest levels of government says this is such an important matter that it is time to produce the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to encourage editors to believe the facts they are giving them are not speculation. They&rsquo;ve shied away from doing this but I don&rsquo;t think they know. I don&rsquo;t think they have any records going back that show the numbers of people coming to this country or numbers of people there illegally. This bedevils the debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem, according to Greenslade, is that lawmakers are scared of raising the subject even though it is a subject the people they represent are concerned about.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is that newspapers tend to be populated and edited by indigenous white people, and also tend to be populist and reactionary. They are not trying to educate people because they are playing to the gallery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And, as Greenslade believes, the media plays up to their audiences&rsquo; prejudices by describing asylum seekers as &#8220;benefit cheats&#8221; or &#8220;spongers,&#8221; lawmakers are wary of expressing opinions on immigration for fear of being accused of racism.</p>
<p>One lawmaker, Roger Godsiff, said he had been branded a racist for expressing what he thought was an uncontroversial opinion that there had to be some limit on immigration, otherwise you risked &#8220;concreting over the whole country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be able to say how many people do you want in the country  &mdash;  no matter where they come from, what ethnic group or religion they are  &mdash;  without being accused of being a racist,&#8221; said Godsiff, who represents part of Birmingham, the UK&rsquo;s second-largest city.</p>
<p>The result, say some analysts, is that the argument about whether or not a certain number of people should enter a country, or the economic benefits they may bring, is rarely conducted rationally, causing widespread confusion about the issue.</p>

		<p>A grain of truth in an article consisting mostly of lies and distortions.</p>
<p>Nationalism is rising in europe&hellip;..for good reason.  More to the point, many politicians see it as a way to permanently entrench themselves in power by giving whites in europe what they need to survive.  Not what they want.  Not luxuries or optional things.  But what they NEED to SURVIVE.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite there yet, but soon it will become impossible for non-whites to obtain socialist services of any kind in europe and it will become very difficult for those (few) who wish to work, to obtain employment.</p>
<p>Non-white invasion has a permanent, lethal flaw.  It requires that whites, willingly work, twice, three, four times as hard as necessary to support these people.  Nobody wants to do that, especially when priority is given to the non-white invaders (as it is, for example, in welfare housing in Britain).  Actually, nobody CAN do that&hellip;.not for very long anyway.  The whole thing is falling apart.</p>
<p>The resulting discontent can be used by anyone who has a mind to, to seize power via nationalism.  Burdened by non-whites, the current quasi-communist regimes that control the EU and various nearby countries, cannot mount a reasonable defense.  This is a horrible miscalculation on the part of these governments.  They thought to build empires upon easily controllable non-white slaves.  Now, they are discovering that non-whites are not easily controlled, contribute nothing, and are openly hostile to their &#8220;masters&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is happening all over europe but is still only in its beginning stages.</p>
<p>A few years from now, no one will be able to deny this is going on.</p>

<p>People generally don&rsquo;t say things unless there is some truth in them. For example, someone wouldn&rsquo;t say he is sad or unhappy if he wasn&rsquo;t sad or unhappy. Likewise, Europeans wouldn&rsquo;t say that Third World immigrants threaten their social norms and culture if their social norms and culture wasn&rsquo;t under threat. Does the writer of this article not realize this obvious truth?</p>
<p>More and more Europeans are starting to realize that the things they take for granted like free speech, freedom of choice and other such modern ideals won&rsquo;t be available if they become minorities in their own countries because of mass immigration from the Third World, particularly Muslim countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic and believe that we&rsquo;re only experiencing the onset: the back lash against multiculturalism in Europe will continue to grow larger and larger.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s surfacing so quickly in Europe because each European country is really quite small when compared to giant countries like America, Canada, Australia or others.</p>
<p>When France starts to get 25% Arab, the remaining Frenchmen notice it quite fast.  The same goes true for other countries.  The liberal race-nazis can &#8216;flood their nations with diversity&rsquo; and hope to break the power of their native people in their own homeland, but the thing about liberals is that they are not known for patience. </p>
<p>They tipped their hand too quickly, and the immigrants have come faster than anyone had expected.  Most of the immigrants also seem to be the bottom of the barrel types, and that also gets peoples&rsquo; attention with all the crime, etc.</p>
<p>MY friends, there is only one way to stop non-white immigration.  Only one way.  And that is to kill the welfare state.  That would be painful for us too, but that&rsquo;s why immigrants are going into every advanced nation.  For the free food stamps, free housing, free education, free social security-type benefits, free medical care, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>Think: if you were some half-starved tribemen in Zambia, or a goat herder in Afghanistan or dirt poor farmer in Mexico, wouldn&rsquo;t you sneak into a country that offered all those things?  And so they come.</p>
<p>Kill all those programs for a while and the immigrants will stop and even begin to go away, once they find an unwelcome atmosphere coupled with no free lunch.  Later, erect phyisical and virtual barriers, then start some useful programs back up.  Think about it&hellip;  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because large numbers of immigrants are a drain on public resources (especially in the age of liberal spending on social programs) and competition for lower-wage, unskilled jobs (though skilled jobs are becoming increasingly threatened too). </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite the opposite.  The journalists, much like this one, are busy trying to shape the mind of the reader, as opposed to printing what the vast majority actually thinks.</p>
<p>There has been no &#8220;tide turning&#8221; with respect to what people think.  Only in terms of what the political and media spheres now allow to be uttered.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;or the economic benefits they may bring&hellip;&#8221;: What they never discuss is that any economic benefit (if any) is temporary, and certainly not universal, whereas population replacement and the fall of a given nation is permanent.  Which is the message the people &#8220;get&#8221; when we see massive immigration, but to which our media, politicians, bleeding hearts and neo-cons seem totally oblivious. </p>

<p>But someone DID produce the facts, Mr Greenslade. And it <i>was</i> someone at the highest levels of government. Indeed, it was someone imminently qualified to measure the economic effects as he was a Phd in Economics and former finance minister. You may have heard of him. His name was Dr. Thilo Sarrazin.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s only a partial solution, at best. It would help, but it wouldn&rsquo;t kill immigration. They would still come here to work, for the money, for the higher standard of living, for the safety, schools, ooportunities,  and many other advantages. (Even the lucrative crime advantages! America offers many opportunities.)</p>
<p>After all, a century ago, millions of immigrants poured in here from Europe. They weren&rsquo;t coming for the welfare! But they still came. Lack of welfare didn&rsquo;t stop them. The Mafia didn&rsquo;t move here from Sicily to get on welfare!</p>

<p>Naturally, because immigrants, like debt, are symptoms of greedy excess.</p>
<p>The first step in restoring the health of the nation is to purge what is causing the pain.  Debts are reigned in, belts are tightened, and foreigners are sent home.</p>

<p>What newspapers have he been reading?  Just recently, I read an article in the Sun (of London) that said that a demographer was &#8220;warning,&#8221; about &#8220;white Britons becomning a minority in their own land.&#8221;  And, although that sort of &#8220;populist and reactionary&#8221; thinking is exactly what I want in a newspaper, I was extremely shocked, because you simply don&rsquo;t hear  stuff like that in major newspapers.  Apparently, the guy who wrote this article thinks all the big papers sound like the BNP now, and they quite simply DON&rsquo;T (unfortunately).</p>

		<p>Here in Finland we have an immigration minister who says that her ministry doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to produce a report on the cost of immigration policy as it is implemented today. When it was demanded of her that she produce a report on how the social benefits provided for asylum seekers compare to those of other countries, what she finally coughed up only included a handful of countries, carefully picked to maintain the lie that the Finnish benefits would be average.</p>
<p>We have our own deadbeat Roma minority who refuse to get educated or employed, but the bigger issue at hand are the new gypsies from Romania, who started panhandling on street corners a couple years back. Along with them came the pickpockets, the burglars, and the muggers of the elderly. It used to be that Finnish tourists needed to be reminded not to keep their wallets in their back pockets when travelling abroad. Now that same advice applies to Finns visiting their capital city. </p>
<p>The bleeding hearts tell us that we should help the Romanian gypsies since they&rsquo;re so poor that they have to resort to begging for a living. When the leftists are asked how these destitute people could have afforded to make the trip across Europe and why they have expensive cars driving them to their street corner and back to their illegally camped mobile homes, they say that they don&rsquo;t care how they got here. When it is shown that these newcomers are part of organized crime, the ex-stalinists just close their eyes. When they give a coin to a beggar, their halo shines a little brighter. They don&rsquo;t want their source of instant Jesus points taken away from them.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m getting at is that objective information would actually work for the anti-immigration side of the debate. All the borderless world enthusiasts have going for them is their ideological &#8220;truth.&#8221; There&rsquo;s no rational debate going on because the pro-immigration position has never been based on rational grounds. Any seemingly rational reasons they have for their beliefs are just an afterthought. They themselves need no convincing that any and all immigration is a good thing. They&rsquo;re believers.</p>

		<p>If Europe is to save itself it will only be with more than a passing brush with pain and even if it does come, comes only at the very last minute.  We in the US should be paying close attention to our brothers on the other side of the Atlantic for cues as to how we extricate ourselves from a similar dilemma.</p>
<p>As has already been pointed out by an astute poster here, the white population of America must work many times harder to make up for the drag of countless brown peoples seeking to drain our very blood.  And also as stated, immigration is not overly suffocating in the US as the country has space for the interlopers to hide.  Yes, the entire state of California is awash with the foreigner, hand out for social services, but such problems have not yet slammed the typical American in the face such as the most popular male name for new borns is mohammed.</p>

<p>Well I&rsquo;m afraid this article is wrong from the get-go.The nomadic subcontinental Indians who arrived in Europe in the 14th century have only been called &#8216;Gypsies&rsquo; ever since they were first known in England 500 years ago, they were never, ever called anything else - there smply was no other descriptive word for them.<br>
 The word &#8216;Roma&rsquo; was invented by some left wing academics no more than 30 years ago and has gradually gained currency since.Apparently it is based on the Gypsy word for &#8216;man&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This is a truth with modifications. Studies from both Denmark and Holland shows that 3rd world immigrants are net consumers of welfare, and their contribution to society is negative. The journalists that colports these lies are mostly dispised here in the northern parts of the continent. Recent studies from Norway show that if it were up to &#8220;our&#8221; journalists, we would live in a communist dictatorship(try Google translate on the following link):</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/crsvo5" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/crsvo5</a></p>
<p>Journalists are increasingly regarded as the lowest of the low amongst ordinary people, do not belive in anything from the MSM in western Europe. Its long since journalist did &#8220;fact checking&#8221;, news that do not agree with socialist propaganda are routinely distorted.   </p>

a certain segment of society has been saying this all along, Only to be maligned and ostraized.  <br>
You mean  more people are feeling the effects and now the muzzle has been removed?  Well knock me over with a feather. <br>
what will happen is the following.<br>
Once it gets more painful, and hopeless for too many, there will be  street fights, along &#8220;racial lines,&#8221; but by then WW III won&rsquo;t be far off.  We have said all along, this diversity thing will do as long as times are good, when they are not, the fur will fly.  Unless whites have been dumbed down beyond recognition. Then they will be slaughtered.  </p>

		<p>Maybe, just maybe, Europe will save itself from demographic oblivion. They have some advantage over us in demographics at present (about 90% of the continent&rsquo;s population is white) and they seem to have made more progress towards a nationalist awakening, despite restrictions on so-called &#8220;hate speech&#8221; that makes it harder for nationalist parties to spread their message. If these parties continue their rise, they will likely succeed in getting some of this repressive legislation repealed or modified, which will further increase their electoral success, as the governments of their countries are less able to stonewall nationalist politicians.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tendency to generalize migration that it&rsquo;s somehow a problem, that it&rsquo;s full of criminals, but that&rsquo;s just not the case.

		<p>It seems to me self evident that the more Africans you allow into your country the more African it becomes. Witness the new phenomenon of gang crime infesting large swathes of London. The more Muslims you allow in the more Muslim your country becomes &hellip; honour killings in the U.K. for example. Or the startling fact that the Muslim community in Britain is just over 3% of the total population and yet has more than 30% of the serious genetic defects because over 50% of Muslim marriages are between first cousins.<br>
It frustrates me that the liberal press countinues to distort the economic benefits of immigration when for example Bangladeshis &amp; Somalis in the U.K. are massive consumers of welfare ultimately consuming far more than they produce. And even if the economic benefits were real, why is the economy the only factor to consider. Why can we not decide that our culture, manifestly superior to theirs, is worth preserving and defending. It is easy &hellip; we just say &#8220;No, you cannot come &amp; if you sneak in illegally we will send you back without appeal&#8221;. Forget human rights &hellip; Illegals have no rights.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In France &hellip; Roma people, also known as gypsies, have been expelled under government orders, while the wearing of burqas and other Islamic face coverings in public is set to be banned.&#8221;</p>
<p>This article is nothing but a propaganda sheet for the Marxist/globalist EUSSR, full of disinformation which no-one who is reliably informed would believe a single word. It&rsquo;s typical globalist Establishment propaganda demonising Europeans, as always, while praising the so-called benefits of multiculturalism/mass immigration. For a start arch-globalist Sarkozy&rsquo;s government - like every pro-globalism government in Europe at present - is deeply concerned about the rise in nationalism throughout Europe, and the expulsion of a few thousand unemployed Gypsies back to Romania is a drop in the ocean compared to the millions of Third World colonisers who enter Europe every single year. Especially as the French government have already admitted that under EUSSR law France has no power to keep out the gypsies whenever they choose to return from their paid holiday back in Romania. It&rsquo;s the same with the banning of the burqa, if this law is passed it will make absolutely no difference to the continuing colonisation of France where Arab &amp; African youths still cause havoc &amp; riot in the banlieus and Muslims hold prayer services in public squares throughout France. Mass immigration/multiculturalism will still continue to over-run France and Europe. </p>
<p>People need to understand that the Marxist/globalist political elite are very worried and are merely throwing a few crumbs from their table in order to fool the indigenous peoples that they are serious about solving Europe&rsquo;s huge mass immigration problem. Nothing could be further from the truth as the Marxists/globalists will never give up their One-world government agenda without the mother of all fights. Crumbs from their table they always throw because if every single policy they applied was against ordinary people and their nation-states and pro-EU/multiculturalism, then their One-world government agenda would be too obvious and they couldn&rsquo;t continue to fool the people like they do at present.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Khalid Koser, from the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, (I&rsquo;d bet the EUSSR funds this none too impartial group) who says that in the current economic climate, foreigners are a useful scapegoat and &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tendency to generalize migration that it&rsquo;s somehow a problem, that it&rsquo;s full of criminals, but that&rsquo;s just not the case. Many migrants are ex-pats returning from the U.S. for instance. Many others are Poles coming to work quite legally, as they have the right.&#8221; What a load of absolute bunk. People know well the difference between ex-pats returning from the USA and when they are actually being colonised for decades by the Third World. Is this clown really paid to produce this globalist brainwashing garbage? And his outrageous lies continue when he tries to tell us that the controlled media are anti-globalist and are spinning stories against mass immigration. He conveniently forgets to explain that there is a difference between the pro-globalist controlled media and the frustrated anti-globalist public on newspaper Internet blogs. The globalist Elite are very worried and these kind of lies are being published regularly, but they seem totally unaware that every single day more and more people are wakening up to their World of Lies and don&rsquo;t believe a single word these brainwashers say.</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, for your excellent,  always well informed, comments.  I know you are in England, right on the spot,  so you know  whereof you speak. </p>
<p>These mere  crumbs that are being tossed to the  European public are just a diversion intended to buy people off,   and purchase a little more time for the ruling elites.  </p>
<p>Stall, stall.  Delay, delay.   Deny, deny.  Pretend to be helping.  That is their  tactic.</p>
<p>Yet,  we have naive posters here who praise every new little crumb that is tossed as a sign of something wonderful that is developing   &mdash;  -  and  who scold the sceptics  who consider  these pathetic, insignificant crumbs as too little and merely diversionary. </p>
<p>These gullible  posters unwittingly serve the other side! They say&hellip; well, you have to give them time. They have to take it little by little. They&rsquo;re starting to get around to it. At last, they&rsquo;re beginning to do something about the problem. And at least something is better than nothing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re STARTING to do something?  Hey, this invasion has been going on for 40-50 years. And only now they&rsquo;re &#8220;starting&#8221; to do something?  That&rsquo;s rubbish!</p>
<p>Frankly,  I would rather have no crumbs at all!  Let the public get angry and realize their true situation, instead of being deceived into thinking their government is trying to help them.    All these crumbs do is divert    the public&rsquo;s anger and buy the rulers more time to solidify their programs and bring in more immigrants. They&rsquo;ve been doing this for years   &mdash;    and getting away with it spectacularly.    It&rsquo;s an old and obvious game that they&rsquo;re playing.  By now we should know better. We should not fall for it.  </p>
<p>Count me a sceptic!  I want to see some REAL improvement.  No crumbs!</p>

		<p>The Europeans need to get US bases out of Europe.  If civil war breaks out the US would intervene on behalf of the non-Europeans and kill whites.  As long as France and the UK have nuclear weapons are not afraid to use them Russia is no longer a threat.</p>

_________________</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. (Is that why we still keep those bases? To have them ready &#8220;just in case&#8221; for the civil war that&rsquo;s coming, of which Bosnia was just a trial run?  Like the Spanish Civil War provided practice for WW2.)</p>
<p>That point  was made clear with Serbia and Bosnia, when our own Gen. Clark [voicing Madeline Albright&rsquo;s policy] stated that [quote] <b>&#8220;There is no place in modern Europe for ethnically pure  states.&#8221;</b>  </p>
<p>So &#8220;our&#8221; policy is out in the open: they must ALL be open to Diversity, enforced by military means if necessary&hellip;. and that&rsquo;s as plain as you can make it.  The globalists will have it no other way.<br>
