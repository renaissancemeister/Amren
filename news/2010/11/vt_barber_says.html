<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2111498&amp;nid=104">Vt. Barber Says Not Good at Cutting Blacks&rsquo; Hair</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Curran, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), November 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The story begins Oct. 5, when Fisher [Dr. Darryl Fisher], a physician from Taos, N.M., was visiting Bellows Falls, a village of about 3,500 residents along the Connecticut River, and walked up the steps into Aldrich&rsquo;s storefront barber shop.</p>
<p>Aldrich [barber Mike Aldrich] was playing cards with a friend, and Fisher asked if the barber was in. Aldrich said no, and Fisher went on his way. Later, walking past, Fisher saw through the front window that the man who&rsquo;d told him the barber was out was cutting the hair of a white customer.</p>
<p>Fisher, 57, didn&rsquo;t go in. When he returned home, though, he sent a letter to the editor of the Brattleboro Reformer newspaper, recounting what had happened and saying he wouldn&rsquo;t want to work or live in Bellows Falls if that&rsquo;s the way businesses treat people.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way he looked at me  &mdash;  and this is just my opinion  &mdash;  and the way he just said, &#8216;No,&rsquo; when I asked if the barber was there and wouldn&rsquo;t tell me when the barber was coming in, and then 15 minutes later he&rsquo;s cutting somebody else&rsquo;s hair. Through my experience with racism, I thought it was racially motivated,&#8221; Fisher said Monday in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Aldrich, a one-man shop who sometimes plays host to impromptu cribbage games between regulars at a table near the front window, has been cutting hair for 40 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aldrich says that he gets only about one black customer a year at his shop in Bellows Falls, which lies on the Vermont-New Hampshire border and is 97 percent white. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry,&#8221; he said he tells them. &#8220;You can sit in the chair if you want, but I&rsquo;ve tried cutting it, and I have problems. Whether I don&rsquo;t have the right equipment, I don&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As unhappy as Fisher was with the treatment, he was impressed when he heard about Saturday&rsquo;s demonstration, in which about two dozen people  &mdash;  at least one carrying a sign that said &#8220;Hate has no home here&#8221;  &mdash;  staged a sidewalk protest. Their message: Bellows Falls and the Vermont region aren&rsquo;t racist.</p>

		<p>What if the barber declined to cut a woman&rsquo;s hair because he felt he couldn&rsquo;t do a decent job?</p>
<p>I go to a chain to get a haircut and try to get the same girl.  Lately the place has hired black woman to cut hair.  All the customers are non-black, white, Asian, but not black.  All the employees used to be assorted non-black woman.  Well one day I walk in and my regular girl was off.  I needed a haircut for a church function so I had to wait for the next available.  My heart was in my throat for fear it would be the very ugly black woman cutting a little blond boys hair.  Fortunately I got a white woman and was so relieved.  There was another time when my regular girl wasn&rsquo;t in I walked out rather than take a chance. </p>
<p>Why would they want a non-black to cut their hair?  Their is different from everybody elses.  I don&rsquo;t want them to touch mine and can not understand why they would want us to touch theirs.</p>

		<p>Vermont is our most socialist state. In fact its a great example of how socialism works. Vermont is clean, well ordered, tranquil.<br>
Its also 98% white. Vermont is comprised of independent<br>
small farmers and wealthy white transplants. Everyone in the state<br>
pulls together to make it a nice place. There is little class<br>
difference and almost no racial difference. No one takes advantage of the system, there is little welfare, and little crime. The problem with Vermont is that everyone there believes the rest of the world is just like Vermont. Thats why they love to dispense their liberal nostrums to the rest of us. But Memphis isnt Montpelier nor is Los Angeles, East St. Louis or<br>
South Chicago.</p>

		<p>Note the IMMEDIATE complaint to the media about &#8221;racism&#8221;&hellip; and the reaction. Never thought that the man [the barber] was on his last customer, wasnt feeling well, etc etc. No, he just &#8221;raciss&rsquo;. The blacks have been trained well to petition the god of media anytime they might feel even the least bit slighted or not pandered to. I&rsquo;m sure the lawsuit is to follow.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t involuntary servitude outlawed by the Constitution?  </p>
<p>Funny, convicted felons cannot be forced to work in prison, but millions of free, innnocent, productive citizens can be compelled by &#8220;civil rights&#8221; laws to work and serve when they choose not to.</p>
<p>Freedom of choice?  A woman has the choice by law to kill her unborn child, but a barber cannot choose whom he serves? A man can divorce his wife, but a business can&rsquo;t refuse a customer?  The customer can always refuse the barber, can&rsquo;t he?  </p>
<p>And what happens when more blacks become employers?  What happens when a desirable employee is a &#8220;racist&#8221; who chooses not to work for a &#8220;protected group member&#8220;&#8216;s company?  Can the employee be placed in involuntary servitude to comply with laws against racial discrimination?</p>
<p>When Japan surrendered to the United States in 1945, many  places in Japan were placed &#8220;off limits&#8221; to American servicemen in deference to the feelings of the Japanese people.  Today in America, the white founders have fewer rights in this regard than the occupants of a conquered country.</p>
<p>Was the barber that Dr. Fisher encountered the only one in town? Hard to believe NO ONE would cut his hair.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dr. Fisher&rsquo;s experience with the barber will help him understand how whites feel when they are rejected because of their race under affirmative action laws.  </p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t they heard?

		<p>God, some blacks can be so paranoid.  Do they just sit around all day and talk about how &#8220;da white man be keepin&rsquo; dem down wit dey racism&#8221;?  I know many of them are truly good people, but its ones like Fisher who really give the whole group of people a bad name.  So you couldn&rsquo;t get your hair cut.  Did it occur to you that maybe the barber really was out, and he just so happened to come back right after you left?  No, that didn&rsquo;t occur to him, because he sees racism around every corner.  And then the barber says he has trouble cutting black peoples&rsquo; hair.  Well, in a state that&rsquo;s about 98% white, of course the poor man has trouble cutting that nappy hair.  It&rsquo;s not necessarily &#8220;racist,&#8221; as Italians and Jews also have hair that can be difficult to cut right (trust me, I got my hair from the Italian side of my family, and I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I had a good haircut.  Its just impossible.)</p>

		<p>I still remember the preachy made-for-TV movie I happened to catch a glimpse of a couple of decades ago. A black boy walks into a barbershop and the barber snarls at him, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t cut steel wool!!&#8221; As the black boy quietly leaves, the shop patrons laugh. Leave it to TV to always paint whites as wicked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I once walked into a barbershop just a block from my home and the barber said to me rather gruffly, &#8220;We aren&rsquo;t taking any new customers.&#8221; There was no sign on the door or window to that effect. Since I&rsquo;m white and so was the barber, there&rsquo;s no one who will protest for me, but if I were black, I&rsquo;m sure I would have a lawsuit on my hands.</p>

		<p>When I was down South a black barber said he didn&rsquo;t cut white people&rsquo;s hair.  Nobody called him a racist for that.  Guess blacks can dish it out but they can&rsquo;t take it, huh?</p>

		<p>This is discrimination in the sense that a white barber does not know how to cut the hair of a black man and a black barber does not know how to cut the hair of a white man. Other than to shave the head bald - - these barbers of whatever race are not qualified to cut the hair of a person from another race.</p>
<p>This too was the sort of thing used almost fifty years ago now when trying to justify the civil rights laws. Test cases where a black man would cross over from North Carolina to South Carolina to get a hair cut at a white barber shop. The refusal of the white barber to cut the hair of a black man was seen as A DETRIMENT TO INTERSTATE COMMERCE!!</p>

		<p>So if the Barber doesn&rsquo;t want to touch n*ppy hair, that should be his prerogative.  The black could go to an African Hair stylist, who&rsquo;d probably be just as prejudiced towards any white customer walking through the door expecting a black person to cut their hair.</p>
<p>Does this guy complain if GM won&rsquo;t fix his Ford?      </p>
<p>White people in mostly black area&rsquo;s are mugged, raped and assaulted by blacks all the time and the media yawns, yet they&rsquo;ll make a big media brewhaha over this trifling non event.    </p>

		<p>Once I asked my barber (female) if blacks ever come into her shop and ask for haircuts. She said she has cut a few heads but they are never happy with the haircut. Iwould suspect that they would prefer to have a homie cut their hair unless they are trying to hit the lottery.</p>

		<p>When I was in the Navy living aboard ship, we had barbers from S3 division assigned for that duty. Unfortunately most of them were ghetto type blacks who would deliberately screw up white peoples hair with crooked sideburns, clipper gashes to the side of the head etc.   These blacks were rude, incompetent and could never be fired for their poor service.  </p>
<p>Rather then take this abuse from blacks I learned to cut my own hair because I knew I couldn&rsquo;t do any worse.       <br>

		<p>A barber in America&hellip; is a Free Man&hellip; Last time I checked. If he doesn&rsquo;t want to cut dirty hair or black hair or white hair&hellip; that should be his business. The black man had every right not to patronize the barber that had every right not to want his business. Slavery was banished long ago in America&hellip; unlike Africa.. where it still exists.</p>

<p>Agreed, up to a point. But where I disagree is about blacks and race. With blacks, race is absolutely everything in their lives. They aren&rsquo;t butchers, bakers or candle stick makers, etc. they&rsquo;re black. Nothing else matters to them and that is generally all of them. From the highest to the lowest. The connection of being black outweighs everything else in life to them.</p>

		<p>If the races were reversed, that letter would have been ignored, much less creating a demonstration of blacks picketing a store because the owner was percevied as anti-European American.  I wish I had known about this sooner, because I would have made a point of driving up to Bellows Falls and getting a haircut to show my support.</p>

		<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet I recommend &#8220;Good Hair,&#8221; a documentary by Chris Rock about black folks&rsquo; obsession with their hair.  Unless you&rsquo;re already familiar with the topic, you may find it an eye-opener.  The whole business of weaves &amp; straighteners   &mdash;   you can see why it&rsquo;s best to let blacks handle all of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I avoid this issue by cutting my own hair. </p>

		<p>There are things that we tend to prioritize having control over.  There are things that blacks tend to prioritize control over. </p>
<p>If blacks are voting to remove our control of who we hire and who we sell our houses to, then perhaps the best strategy is to vote to remove individual control over things that we do not particularly care about, but that blacks or liberals care about.</p>
<p>For example, what if we try to get laws passed that remove individual control over clothing and hair styles. Or make laws against the voicing the particular  views liberals espouse, while letting them know that we would rather a system that allowed all speech, but they are not cooperating so this is our way of punishing them.</p>
<p>And keep passing them until they relent on depriving us of the liberties we desire?</p>

		<p>Dude is in a town that is 97 percent white and he expects the local (white) barber to know how to cut his hair. Instead of being so quick to pull out the race card, why didn&rsquo;t he just ask the barber why not? - although common sense would have told me that a white barber in a 97 percent white town would not know how to cut my black hair! </p>
<p>Same thing if the races were reversed. And why would he even want to give the inexperienced barber a chance to mess up his haircut? At the same time the barber was rude. If he had told him that he did not know how to cut black hair I&rsquo;m sure the guy would have understood. </p>
<p>But again, where is the common sense? I would have gotten my trim at home. White barbers wouldn&rsquo;t know how to cut black hair unless they had a steady black clientele. </p>

		<p>Say what you will about Vermont&rsquo;s liberalism, they do have some of the least-restrictive gun laws in the U.S. (e.g. may carry open or concealed without a permit). Add in the fact that it&rsquo;s 98% White and what you get is a low crime rate and one of the safest places to live in the world.</p>

		<p>This is a truly old story.  Way back in the late Fifties, when I was about fourteen or fifteen and living in Madison, NJ, a local barber declined to cut a black man&rsquo;s hair, saying that he didn&rsquo;t feel competent to do the job properly.  Students from nearby Drew University poured off the campus to picket the poor sod&rsquo;s barber shop, organize protest marches, and stage a sit-in on the premises.  The bigger NJ dailies all picked up the story, making the barber more famous than he&rsquo;d ever wanted.</p>
<p>It seemingly was never determined whether the barber&rsquo;s refusal was based on maintaining professional standards or racist sentiments toward blacks.  </p>

		<p>Petrarch, #15, made my point better than I did.</p>
<p>Incidents like this work me up because I like people and I LIKE BLACKS and these incidents make ordinary human nature seem evil.</p>
<p>When I was a Skycap(porter, baggage carrier) at Dulles Airport a black Skycap refused to carry the bags of a white woman with a small child to a distant part of the airport because she told him upfront that she couldn&rsquo;t afford to tip.  The Skycap was an employee of the airport, not an enterpreneur in business for himself like the barber in Bellows Falls, but it never occurred to me or the woman to complain about him.  We just thought he was an ordinary heel and left it at that.</p>
<p>Blacks often complain about taxi cab drivers who pass them by in favor of whites who tip better, and I&rsquo;ve been refused service by black drivers several times.  There was a law against that in D.C. but I didn&rsquo;t think I had the right to tell anyone he had to work for me.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher and his race have received countless beneifts from white folks.  Why can&rsquo;t they tolerate in return?  Answer:  something that a conservative writer named Albert Jay Nock called Epsteen&rsquo;s (Epstein&rsquo;s?) Law:  human beings tend to satisfy their needs in the easiest possible way and the easiest possible way is to exploit (mooch off) someone else who has what you want.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher can refuse to treat a patient and he ought to give the same right to that barber in Bellows Falls.</p>

		<p>If I was a black guy and I really thought the guy was a racist, why would I want to give him my business anyways?</p>

		<p>Funny, because my barber told me the same thing that other posters were told by their barbers.  My barber said he tried cutting a black&rsquo;s hair on two different occasions but that it was very &#8220;tricky&#8221; and that the customers weren&rsquo;t satisfied but there were no hard feelings.</p>
<p>Therefore, he longer accepts black customers not because he doesn&rsquo;t like blacks but because he doesn&rsquo;t want to take their money and have them walk away dissatisfied.    </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure black barbers have turned away white customers due to racial prejudice but since they are now the superior race in America they are allowed to discriminate against us without penalty or repercussions.  </p>

		<p>About 10 years ago I was looking for a certain barber shop and accidentally walked into a shop where a Black man was cutting another Black man&rsquo;s hair, and it seemed obviously a &#8220;black barber shop.&#8221;  I didn&rsquo;t just want to walk out, particularly since it was a particularly &#8220;racist&#8221; area, and I just didn&rsquo;t want to communicate that.  So, when he looked up and said, &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was even okay for me to be in there, or whether I&rsquo;d seem some idiotic White on his own project to combat racism, or what they&rsquo;d think.  So, I improvised and what seemed the perfect question came to mind.  I said, &#8220;Do you cut straight hair?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yeah, I cut straight hair.&#8221;  So, I sat down and waited while he finished the other Black guy&rsquo;s hair. I did notice there seemed to be all kinds of weird things he did to Black guy&rsquo;s hair, somehow adding an element of chaos that improved, I thought, the otherwise too regular look he&rsquo;d first layered it with.  There&rsquo;s something to it.  </p>
<p>Then when he started on mine he told me how he&rsquo;d learned in the Army and then gone to work in Maryland (we were in Georgia), in a suburb where nearly all his customers &#8220;had straight hair.&#8221; He did a pretty good job, though I&rsquo;m too much the slob to really think too much about my hair to objectively appraise it.  But, he was obviously competent.  </p>
<p>Funny that we never mentioned race, though we both knew exactly what we were talking about, and indeed it was a practical matter, since I could see myself by the way he cut the other guy&rsquo;s hair that there really was a practical difference. And he even seemed to appreciate the fact that I&rsquo;d understood the problem in that way.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how people who don&rsquo;t understand the simplest things can get themselves worked up into a political meaning so they can star themselves as &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; in case they missed their chance to have been that in the sixties or something.  First, the read about it in school and were brain-washed there and practically everywhere, and they just can&rsquo;t pass up the chance to be their own personal cliche marching on a barber shop with anti-racist posters and such, hoping someone gets the photos.</p>

		<p>As a measure of just how far America has degenerated down the road of PC madness isn&rsquo;t it amazing that such an issue is made out of a haircut in one small town?</p>

		<p>My story is much the same at my barber of the last 50 years in Joliet, Illinois.  White men and Mexican men (both of whom have straight or wavy hair) patronize Joe and blacks (woolly hair) go to Duke&rsquo;s shop two blocks away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no &#8216;color line&rsquo; at either shop.  The black men I know realize that my Italian guys have not cut the hair of blacks and the black man doesn&rsquo;t have the experience to cut Caucasian hair.</p>
<p>Life in Joliet goes on without any complaint.</p>

		<p>I am with the barber on this one. He was honest enough to admit his fear of not being able to give a Black man a decent haircut.</p>

		<p>None of these comments will change the fact that most black barbershops in America have an atmosphere that sounds a lot like a Nation of Islam meeting. Except that the conversation sounds a lot more ignorant than an average NOI spokesman. That&rsquo;s true in barbershop after barbershop. What are the important people doing about that? Correcting this barber in Vermont I guess. Never enough effort can be spared to get to the real racial troubles. </p>

		<p>It breaks my heart that an old white guy who&rsquo;s been cutting hair in a small town for 40 years gets picketed and accused of hate. I seriously doubt that there will be any effect on his business, but the disrespect is sad. That being said, the original article is actually much more respectful of the barber than I thought it would be. It actually vindicated the barber and made the &#8220;doctor&#8221; look like a whiner. Here are some excerpts that were left out of the Amren version:</p>
<p>&#8220;Interim town manager Francis Walsh describes Aldrich as &#8220;the kind of guy if you went in there and you asked for a haircut and he was playing cards, he&rsquo;d tell you to leave.&#8221;&#8221; <br>
  &mdash;  -Suggests that like many old white barbers, this guy is more interested in the socializing aspect of the job than he is with the money, and that it is not unusual for him to turn down business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morrow, an expert on black hair and product developer who has written textbooks about its treatment, says others have the same problem Aldrich does.&#8221;He&rsquo;s telling the truth. He literally cannot (cut black hair),&#8221; said Morrow, who&rsquo;s black. &#8220;The doctor would&rsquo;ve been very upset at the haircut he would&rsquo;ve gotten.&#8221;&#8220;<br>
  &mdash;  -This is how the article ends, with a black expert on cutting black hair siding with the white barber!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;One jerk is not going to ruin everything,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;The number of people who&rsquo;ve protested him, that&rsquo;s a very good sign. I&rsquo;m impressed. It&rsquo;s made me feel super welcome. I&rsquo;ll be back in Bellows Falls in December and won&rsquo;t be so nervous walking up and down the street.&#8221;&#8220;<br>
  &mdash;  -This quotation is found immediately before the final comment by the black hair dressing expert; the placement of this quotation makes the doctor look really stupid and paranoid.</p>
