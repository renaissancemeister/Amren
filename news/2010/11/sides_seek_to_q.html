<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of students arrested because of fights and related incidents at Harrisburg High School in this tension-filled week?</p>
<p>Two  &mdash;  both for bringing weapons onto school grounds. One of the boys was found with a loaded gun, ostensibly for protection.</p>
<p>The number of students temporarily removed from the school through suspension? At least 12, maybe as many as 15, school officials said.</p>
<p>And the number of students who admit wondering, and possibly fearing, what&rsquo;s going to happen when they hit the John Harris campus today?</p>
<p>Too many to count.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rumors in the wake of a cafeteria standoff between a black and a Puerto Rican student last Friday appear, to date, to have actually outpaced the actual number of extraordinary incidents in the school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the meeting, they identified a number of short-term steps they are taking to try to stop things from escalating at Harrisburg High now, including an in-building police presence throughout the day, random security screenings of students as they arrive, and the imposition of immediate suspensions on those breaking rules.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the ideas that seemed to get a lot of favor was an increased emphasis on formal diversity training for staff and finding a controlled forum in which students who are having issues can peacefully air their problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other suggestions included the installation of permanent metal detectors, and a strictly enforced ban on bringing cell phones or other electronic communications devices to the school, to tamp down the rapid spread of rumors that, supporters said, can provoke their own set of problems.</p>

		<p>I knew a white kid in Northern CA in 1971, who after being beaten up in front of the principal&rsquo;s office by a group of blacks, (while the principle and staff locked the doors and watched) brought a revolver to school. He kept it in his jacket pocket.  When some black kids approached him the next day, he pulled back the hammer so that they could hear the clicks.  They ran.  Within a day or two, riots broke out at the school that lasted three days.  They wouldn&rsquo;t put it on the news because they feared it would spread.  That was California in 1971!</p>
<p>It ended when blacks stayed indoors for several days.  The police couldn&rsquo;t do anything.  White boys drove around town with baseball bats, going after every black male they saw.  This happened after several years of growing harassment against whites, including the gang beatings of white guys who were boyfriends of &#8220;chosen&#8221; white girls.</p>

		<p>The trouble between Black and Hispanic students at Harrisburg High reminds me of the trouble between America and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>
<p>America and The Soviet Union avoided war during those troubled times by engaging in an arms race that guaranteed mutual mass destruction if either side engaged in a serious act of aggression towards the opposing nation. </p>
<p>I think that approach would work well for the kids at Harrisburg High and schools with similar problems. </p>
<p>I am not advocating that we should provide those students with nuclear weapons. Not at first, anyway. I am merely suggesting that if every student was equipped with adequate small arms and ammunition that they would be less willing to make any move that could be in any way mistaken as an act of aggression.</p>
<p>Even in the worst case scenario, this plan would solve the problems at Harrisburg High once and for all.  </p>

		<p>Blacks and mestizos throughout the country don&rsquo;t get along, with just a few exceptions.</p>
<p>The blacks, as they do with every non-black group, intimidates and bullies them, because that is a natural inclination of blacks.  Most of them are cowards and have a herd mentality which delights in overwhelming an unsuspecting non-black.</p>
<p>But a part of why they behave so badly has to do with the fact that every race outperforms blacks generally.  Blacks are quite aware of it and are constantly looking to lash out because of petty jealousy.</p>
<p>In the case of mestizos, blacks resent the fact mestizos can get jobs they can&rsquo;t, because they have a far better work ethic, are more industrious, and their general group intelligence is higher than the black average.</p>
<p>If mestizos were but a small percentage of the population, blacks would likely get away with harrassing them and intimidating them without much opposition, but since mestizos very often outnumber blacks in certain areas they&rsquo;re fighting back, which is something blacks don&rsquo;t expect them to do.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all resulting in armed conflicts in California and a few other areas of the country.  The situation is volatile and will continue to worsen.  Having some moronic NAACP official talk to what he perceives to be a &#8220;Latin leader&#8221; is going to do about as much good as telling a crack addict he should quit crack, because it isn&rsquo;t good for him and expect him to take the advise to heart.</p>
<p>The black/brown fighting and killing will become more intense as the job situation deteriorates.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Rumors in the wake of a cafeteria standoff between a black and a Puerto Rican student last Friday appear, to date, to have actually outpaced the actual number of extraordinary incidents in the school.&rdquo;  The Puerto Ricans grumble, &#8220;fair fight,&#8221; But if they start a rumble, we&rsquo;ll rumble them right!</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the meeting, they identified a number of short-term steps they are taking to try to stop things from escalating at Harrisburg High now, including an in-building police presence throughout the day, random security screenings of students as they arrive, and the imposition of immediate suspensions on those breaking rules.&rdquo;  How about having one group shipped to Mexico City and the other group shipped to Haiti (could care less about which group ends up where).  <br>
    <br>
&ldquo;Among the ideas that seemed to get a lot of favor was an increased emphasis on formal diversity training for staff and finding a controlled forum in which students who are having issues can peacefully air their problems.&rdquo;  Just so much multicultural rhetoric; and who will control the forum, Martians?  I know, let Tim Wise do the formal diversity training.<br>
  <br>
&ldquo;Other suggestions included the installation of permanent metal detectors, and a strictly enforced ban on bringing cell phones or other electronic communications devices to the school, to tamp down the rapid spread of rumors that, supporters said, can provoke their own set of problems.&rdquo;  How about the installation and use of the Galvanic Battery in adjusting behavioral problems; a good place for the location and function of the machine would be the library (I would guess the library is not used anyhow).</p>
<p>Who really cares about Harrisburg High School, anyway?  They are probably reaping what they sow.  <br>

		<p>Puerto Ricans aren&rsquo;t something new in Pennsylvania.  Ever since the mayor of one city in Pennsylvania opened the door by inviting as many PR&rsquo;s as possible into that city to be employed in the steel industry, they have been there.  For the most part, they did not form gangs.  They were not illegal since PR is a US entity.  They ARE, however, racially proud.  They are often hard working.  They do serve in the military willingly.</p>
<p>I do not classify them as anything akin to the illegal mestizos flooding our country.<br>
On the other hand, there WERE certain parts of those cities which saw increases in crime due to the PR presence.  Always, it seems, any non-white immigration results in increases in crime to a greater or lesser degree, more racial tension, more Whites out of jobs, etc.  Harrisburg PA is rapidly becoming &#8220;little Philadelphia South Side&#8221;.  The one consistent factor that never deviates is that anywhere blacks are numerous, you have major problems in crime, schools, gang activity, and general violence.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I had a friend who became a teacher at a nice white middle school in Long Island, New York.  Over the years the school moved to all black.  The effect on my friend, who had served in the Marines and could take a lot of stuff, was devastating.  </p>
<p>He told me that the large majority of black kids just didn&rsquo;t care about learning, and their parents also could care less.    His job changed from being a teacher to being a warden.  He felt useless.  He requested transfers which were denied.</p>
<p>He retired from the school system with psychological problems due to the enviroment.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to teach effectively or maintain discipline when a large number of &#8220;dark skins&#8221; are present.  There are many Harrisburgs we haven&rsquo;t heard about yet.</p>
<p>The whole country is going down the tubes.  Prepare yourself.</p>

		<p>I resent the comment about &#8220;dark skins&#8221;. Asian Indians have dark skin too but teachers love us. Google &#8220;Monta Vista High School&#8221;&hellip;.The school has is 80 percent Asian, half of which are Asian Indians. The school has a WAY higher achievement rate and WAY fewer discipline problems than white schools. Many Asian Indians have skin darker than Blacks but we hate being lumped with them because of our color. Culturally and behaviorwise we are opposite of them, more conservative than whites. I fear when the country goes down, we may be lumped with them cuz of &#8220;our skin color&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>I resent the comment about &ldquo;dark skins&rdquo;. </i></p>
<p>I do not think that Asians were meant here.</p>
<p>Rajesh, what is your perception of racial issues in America, especially in the schools? Are the race realists onto something correlating median IQ with school performance and discipline issues? Are there other cultural issues involved?</p>
