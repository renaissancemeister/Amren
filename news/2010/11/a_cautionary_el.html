<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, John Maynard Keynes wrote that the &#8220;best way to destroy the Capitalist System&#8221; was to &#8220;debauch the currency&#8221; through &#8220;a continuing process of inflation,&#8221; one that allowed governments to &#8220;confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.&#8221; If inflation is the best way to destroy a free-market economy, Peter Dreier, an advisor to Obama&rsquo;s 2008 campaign, deserves credit for discovering the second-best way. In his new study of the president, Radical-in-Chief, Stanley Kurtz cites a 1979 essay, &#8220;The Case for Transitional Reform,&#8221; in which Dreier envisioned a progressive politics that would undermine America&rsquo;s market economy by &#8220;injecting unmanageable strains into the capitalist system, strains that precipitate an economic and/or political crisis.&#8221; In Dreier&rsquo;s prophecy, a &#8220;revolution of rising entitlements&#8221; and an &#8220;expansion of state activity and budgets&#8221; would bring about a &#8220;fiscal crisis&#8221; and lead to a vast expansion of government authority over the economy.</p>
<p>Three decades later, Dreier&rsquo;s vision of an ever more rapacious public sector inexorably confiscating the wealth of the productive element of the nation is becoming a reality. In &#8220;The Case Against the Fiscal Stimulus,&#8221; Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron lays bare the unstated purposes that animate Obama&rsquo;s economic policies. The administration&rsquo;s &#8220;true goals were not just economic stimulus,&#8221; Miron argues. &#8220;Instead, the Administration wanted to reward its constituencies (unions, environmentalists, public education) and increase the size and scope of government. This tactic is consistent with the Administration&rsquo;s policies in general. Across the board, it has taken a big government, redistributionist approach, whether regarding housing, unions, health, the auto industry, trade, antitrust, or financial regulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet even as voters said &#8220;No we won&rsquo;t&#8221; on Tuesday, it is not clear that the Republicans they tapped to deliver their rebuke will have enough power to resist Obama&rsquo;s efforts to enlarge the public sector. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Liberal demographers like Ruy Teixeira of the Center for American Progress believe that the changing complexion of the electorate will make the political environment in 2012 considerably tougher for Republicans. Teixeira argues that as the number of non-Hispanic white voters falls, relative to the overall population, growing nonwhite minorities will continue to favor the Democrats. Liberal demographers might not be right when they argue that minority voters  &mdash;  particularly Latinos  &mdash;  are likely to prove decisive in the next presidential contest, but Republicans would be foolish to underestimate the challenges that confront them.</p>
<p>President Obama, for his part, is gambling that the liberal demographers are right. As early as July, the White House began to turn away from the rhetoric of postracial unity that Obama used in the 2008 campaign and to experiment with a rhetoric of racial and ethnic revanchism. The &#8220;Republicans, if you do the math,&#8221; a Democratic insider told the Washington Post&rsquo;s Michael D. Shear, &#8220;cannot be successful as a national party if they continue to alienate Latinos.&#8221; In June, when a group of Latino activists visited the president in the White House, top aide Valerie Jarrett &#8220;made one thing clear to them: The White House plans to use the immigration debate to punish the GOP and aggressively seek the Latino vote in 2012.&#8221; The president was clearly following the new electoral counsel of discipline and punish in his now notorious interview on Unavision, in which he called on Latinos &#8220;to punish our enemies&#8221; and &#8220;reward our friends.&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>The best way to destroy the Capitalist system is to  allow too many ex-CEOs to become politicians. The state no longer mediates between the greed of any social class, owners feed the greed of the workers by degenerating them into raceless, cultureless individualist consumers who legally rip off the state. The Modern West.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a &#8216;republican&rsquo;, and for the most part I despise the democrats who only ever really seem concerned with making people afraid of them and their issues, but I disagree with the spin here with this &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; article. The government needed to increase spending when the economy was struggling. Didn&rsquo;t president Bush also pass more than one stimulus package? Is stimulus only bad when the Democrats do it? </p>

		<p>To #3 above.  Dear Whiteman, the stimulus is terrible for this country because it lowers the value of our currency to even lower levels from its present worthless condition.  This means 90% of Americans will never retire, and your grand kids will live in poverty.  Unlike in the past, we can&rsquo;t grow our way out of our present situation because we have nothing like gold backing the dollar, and the the Chinese are undercutting us in prices, paying very low wages, and achieving very high scholastic results.  We can&rsquo;t compete on the basics.  </p>

<p>You mean, my man, that Teixeira &#8220;HOPES&#8221; there is a changing complexion of the voters in 2012 which will be disadvantageous for Republicans.</p>
<p>But none of you brilliant analyzers have been right on anything yet, and now you&rsquo;re making your forecasts based on your incorrect evaluations that everything will be o.k. in the US come 2012.</p>
<p>But what if there is a SEVERE depression?  Wouldn&rsquo;t that bring people out in the streets?  Would that not reduce the influx of free loaders coming to this country?  Wouldn&rsquo;t a lot of people leave rather than scrounge through the dump for food and necessities?  </p>
<p>Who wants to live through a Northern Winter in a tent city?  And those in the Southwest might not have to endure the cold but certainly the pickings would be meager in a desert setting, which comprises most of the Southwest.  The lush landscapes of Eastern and Southern Mexico are far more hospitable to those who are forced to live off the land.</p>
<p>And last but not least, there will be a LOT of violence and fighting going on toward the end of 2012 and thereafter. </p>
<p>So I would advise these same liberal forecasters to stop worrying about where whites will be in 2050&hellip;.or even 2012.  Chances are that somebody will have tired of their tired old cliches and they won&rsquo;t be around anyway.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I read in the liberal magazine <i>American Prospect</i> about how demographic changes thanks to mass immigration were creating a constituency more favorable for the Democrats.  They were all in favor of it, of course.  While the left is openly gloating about the ongoing success of their plan to replace the electorate the Republicans remain clueless.  Listen to one of their &#8220;leaders&#8221;, Newt Gingrich, and all he does is babble about more tax cuts   &mdash;   in a country that is running an annual federal deficit of $1,500 billion.  In thrall to the corporations, which want cheap labor, the Republicans are unlikely to enforce immigration law and certainly won&rsquo;t cut legal immigration.  Their own policies will make whites a minority and when that happens the Republicans will be a permanent minority party.<br/>

		<p>The international bankers who are devoted to One World Government and total control of currencies could care less who is President, or how many seats the GOP wins in the Congress. There is one US agency they care about: The Federal Reserve. On Nov 4, few except the financial press noted the Board&rsquo;s meeting and Bernanke&rsquo;s seizure of the Treasury bond market. Professor Bernanke will now proceed to liquidate US currency. The crisis will follow, martial law may be necessary, and the masses, holding worthless bills and no credit, will follow the designated military coalition, national at first but perhaps international later. Ben Bernanke could care less who wins the elections. He, his Board and their banker clients make the real decisions,not the voters here, in Europe or Japan. How the Chinese do business with Ben and his Board will be interesting to watch. None of it is in the interest of the US worker, small businessperson or salaried professional.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And minority small business contrats and minority entitlements in the financial, real estate, medical, education and law enforcement areas.</p>
<p>Have some testicular fortitude man.  This person is no more post-racial than a smash and grab artist left alone in a jewelry store for five minutes.  And until we admit that his racism is the truth of the phantom menace made of ours, we will never unhook ourselves from the con.</p>
<p>Assuming we can get him outta there in 2+ and assuming the world doesn&rsquo;t end before then, we are gonna spend the next 8+ undoing what he has done, at which point the Dems will get their demographic victory while the world laughs at us standing there with our hands out for &#8216;just one more!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I swear, we must look like the biggest bunch of moron drug addicts ever let loose upon our own exchequer.</p>

<p>Completely gutless.  To -who- good sir?  Who has benefitted from these &#8216;redistributions&rsquo;?  Lets have a list of specific businesses and then let&rsquo;s look up the definition for &#8216;post-racialism&rsquo;, shall we?</p>
<p>The only question here is whether or not this is part of some bigger plan and Obamarama is in on it or if he is as much a clueless patsy as the rest of us.</p>
<p>The people who run our government, through the banks and big multis houses are not so stupid as to walk into this blind.  They are not, so we must assume that an attempt to destabilize the world&rsquo;s largest economy by spending it into the gutter has purpose.<br/>

		<p>Pandering to the hispanic vote is exactly what will cause our demise, since pandering to the hispanic vote always means amnesty, and open borders.  The way to reduce the clout of hispanic votes is to get TOUGHER on immigration, not more lenient.  The Republicans and Tea Party conservatives will NEVER gain a majority of the black or brown vote.  Never.  What they need to do is reduce the black and brown vote by closing the borders to immigrants from the third world, and make America a haven for liberty seeking WHITES as it used to be.  Deny any and all services to illegal aliens. Abolish the outdated provision for anchor babies.  Prosecute vigorously any employer who hires illegals.  Deport ALL illegals.  The brown vote will drop, wages will increase, blacks will find jobs, and European Whites will flee to America seeking freedom from THEIR multi-cult extinction.</p>

		<p>@9 Bill R.,</p>
<p>I agree that we owe it to places like South Africa which is currently looking at an extinction by inches condition to get the victims of our 1960-1990 liberal interference out of there before something really ugly happens.</p>
<p>I just hope that whoever ends up with control over the resource mines there can be dealt with.</p>
<p>It is my hope however that, now that nationalism is on the rise in Europe, it too may be saved from a North African and Middle Eastern horde influx.  Simply by keeping whites from feeling they have no choice but to evacuate.</p>
<p>In this, perhaps the greatest &#8216;lead by demonstrated example, not by promised truth&rsquo; role we may undertake as leaders of the West is to stand back from our own radicalization and try to come to grips with our whiteness as a PLUS to be endorsed and cherished.</p>
<p>Not just Europe but Canada, Australia and even parts of South America (where a large number of Germans are now headed) may depend on our success to begin reversing their own no-limits influx of unassimilable ethnis.</p>
<p>This is just the opening fusilade in what could end up being a very long, bitter, struggle.</p>

		<p>Ditto to everything Bill R. said above.  The biggest long-term threat to this country is unfettered immigration, legal AND illegal.  I was saying this before 9/11, both to family and friends and my clueless at the time)Republican congressman.  He never got it, is now out of office, and hopefully (we&rsquo;re still awaiting the final results) will be replaced by an anti-illegal immigration Tea Party representative.  If immigration is not stanched, and illegal immigration reversed, we are through as a nation.</p>

		<p>Off-topic, but I do detect a leftist mind-spinner. No way is #3 a republican, as he seems to claim. This is a typical marxist mind-job in practice, boys, observe and remember.</p>
<p>As regards to Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric of &#8220;racial and ethnic revanchism&#8221;, this would indicate that the marxist camp seems to believe that there is just cause for a white revanche. And that in itself would prove that the anti-white movement that has almost succeeded to racially and ethnically marginalise white America in the greatest country white (european) Americans won and built, is no way an accident nor a result of stupidity. It has been a deliberate policy and now the perpetrators fear a white revanche. But their fear is a good indication, it shows their weakness and it shows that white America still has a chance to take revanche and save white America from marginalization. The first step towards that would be a repeal of 1965 leftist immigration policy.</p>

Put the wailing aside: </p>
<p>The answer is to cut spending, not on medicare or the military,</p>
<p> but cut out the UN budget completely, cut all so called foreign aid to each county, cut all congressional staff by 50%, </p>
<p>collect all bonuses paid to fannie mae and freddie mac pols, cut pelosijets, cut obama vacations, fine all countries $5000 each</p>
<p> for illegal aliens caught in USA  &mdash;  and this is just a start to dealing with waste of American tax payer dollars. </p>

Americans need to realize this is a deliberate, conscious strategy. Real Enemies have succeeded in almost completing their take over of America. <br/>
Enemies. This is Not politics as usual. It is not opinion. This is an Attack. <br/>
Americans, those who believe in the Constitution&hellip;.have a right and duty to fight back. </p>
