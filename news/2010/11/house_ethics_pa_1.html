			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i> Susan Crabtree and Jordan Fabian, The Hill, Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), once one of the most powerful members of the House, was convicted Tuesday on 11 counts of violating House ethics rules and now faces punishment.</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the adjudicatory subcommittee and the full House ethics committee, announced the decision late Tuesday morning following an abbreviated public trial and nearly six hours of deliberations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The full ethics panel will now convene a sanctions hearing to recommend a punishment, which ethics experts say will most likely be a reprimand or formal censure. The ethics committee Tuesday afternoon had yet to announce when the hearing would occur.</p>
<p>Serious sanctions  &mdash;  including formal reprimand, censure or expulsion  &mdash;  require a vote on the House floor. Expulsion requires a two-thirds vote, while a reprimand, which Rangel refused to agree to in July, or a censure would need just a simple majority. The ethics panel could also impose a fine and deny some of Rangel&rsquo;s House privileges.</p>
<p>But Rangel, 80, is certainly not expected to lose his job. The silver-haired 20-term veteran, known for his gravelly voice, humor and sartorial splendor, is still beloved by many of his House colleagues. And in the lame-duck session, Democrats still hold the majority.</p>
<p>Either reprimand or formal censure carry no immediate, tangible consequence for Rangel, who easily won reelection this month, but the sweeping guilty verdict delivers a damaging blow to his reputation and 40-year political legacy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked if he had any reaction to the panel&rsquo;s decision, Rangel initially told reporters, &#8220;Nope, none,&#8221; adding that he first saw the ruling on television.</p>
<p>Later, in an official statement, Rangel slammed the ethics subcommittee&rsquo;s &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; decision, saying his due process rights were violated because the panel ruled without him having legal representation.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can anyone have confidence in the decision of the ethics subcommittee when I was deprived of due process rights, right to counsel and was not even in the room?&#8221; Rangel said. &#8220;I can only hope that the full committee will treat me more fairly, and take into account my entire 40 years of service to the Congress before making any decisions on sanction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rangel also lamented the lack of a system to appeal the House ethics panel&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I am required to accept the findings of the Ethics Committee, I am compelled to state again the unfairness of its continuation without affording me the opportunity to obtain legal counsel as guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Rangel could face anywhere between one soft and three really hard slaps on the hand.</p>
<p>Seriously, why should he care?  He walked out of the hearing because he could.  The one and only chance for punishment for his ethics transgressions came in September, when Adam Clayton Powell IV challenged him in the Democrat Primary for NY-15.  Rangel won easily, by more than 2-to-1.</p>
<p>PJB said in a column a few weeks ago that the House Ethics Committee was at the time investigating only eight House members, (including Rangel), and that all eight of them are black.  I got out my calculator, and figured that with 39 black members out of 435 total members, the odds of choosing any eight at random and their all being black are 239 million to one.  Now, black House members are probably more corrupt on average than white House members, but not that much more.</p>

		<p>Bottom line he is no worse than any of the other white trash faggots we have in DC. The whole thing is a cluster f___. Listen if these people weren&rsquo;t on the take if they weren&rsquo;t all selling us down the river then they wouldn&rsquo;t be in office. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone has any good in them at all. Nothing will purge these jerkmeisters but a living breathing revolution. </p>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t Wrangle lose his job. In the private sector, he would have been fired and perhaps done some jail time. But as a professional politician, he gets a slap on the wrist. He been firmly ensconsed for 40 years and is the poster boy for term limits!</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be so certain about the expulsion issue.</p>
<p>There is some sort of intercine warfare going on in the democratic party.  Because the party is nothing more than a loose coalition of identity groups that barely get along, and in fact, despise eachother, the conflict is along racial lines.</p>
<p>Expulsion of Rangel would be an extremely harsh blow to one of these identity groups, allowing the others to essentially plunder their resources.</p>
<p>Note the lack of even basic respect or restraint the bipartisan house panel displayed dealing with Rangel.</p>

		<p>Rangel is not apt to be ousted from the House by his fellow Democrats, but his crimes are at a level where he should be.  It&rsquo;s more likely than not that Scary Nancy rushed to have his trial before the GOP took over, because he would have been thrown out for certain.  Maybe some criminal charges as well, but those are still a possibility.</p>
<p>But, at 80 years old, seriously overweight, frail, and looking and acting more so every day, he&rsquo;s almost a non-entity. </p>

		<p>Nothing serious will be done to him because they know he won&rsquo;t go &#8220;quietly into the night&#8221; and will take alot of them with him. He&rsquo;s been in there long enough to have some dirt on every one of them. That&rsquo;s probably one of the ways he&rsquo;s gotten so wealthy, blackmail pays very well. He&rsquo;s an old school thug who knows how to play hardball and those spineless White boys know it!  </p>

		<p>He couldn&rsquo;t care less about his reputation or the slap on the wrist. The mindless idiots of Harlem will continue to vote him in because of his skin color. And he will laugh all the way to the bank.</p>

		<p>Why bother with this? They will not let him go. So what is the point? It is a show. Nothing changes. Congress is corrupt and being black in congress is extra protection for when one is doing wrong. </p>
<p>If corrupt white congress people are protected, then minority types must be invincible. It is a sick joke. </p>

<p>What a joke!  What was all the smoke about? A 2 1/2 year investigation for this?   Was it worth it?</p>
<p>In other words, this will mean nothing to him except a  slightly bruised ego (which he will laugh off).   It&rsquo;s merely a slap on the wrist.  Why should he care? </p>
<p>And he &#8220;easily won reelection this month&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s plain as day that his Harlem constituents don&rsquo;t care either.  <br>
Corruption is OK with them.  They admire him for it.</p>
