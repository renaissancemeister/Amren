			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allie Grasgreen, USA Today, Nov. 10, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Colleges strive to create welcoming, inclusive communities for students from every background. But a new effort at George Washington University has scores of critics and supporters abuzz with heated comments that continue to pour in on various blogs and news articles.</p>
<p>At the request of the university&rsquo;s Muslim Students&rsquo; Association, George Washington began offering a once-weekly, female-only swim hour in March. But it only recently turned into an online debate over issues of religious and sexual discrimination and  &mdash;  though not always explicitly  &mdash;  racism, spurred by an article in the student newspaper, The GW Hatchet.</p>
<p>The Lerner Health and Wellness Center pool closes to men for one of the 20 hours it&rsquo;s open each week, with a tarp blocking the view through the glass door and a female lifeguard on duty. The university declined to comment for this article beyond a two-sentence statement that said its officials are reviewing the closure while they establish a formal recreational swim policy.</p>
<p>A few highlights from Internet comments on The Washington Post&rsquo;s and TBD&rsquo;s recent coverage of the swim hour: &#8220;Should a minuscule minority force the overwhelming majority [to] abide by their rules or should it be the other way around?&#8221; &#8220;Western society should not accommodate to Islam on this point; it is Islam that should change.&#8221; And in rebuttal: &#8220;Come on, folks. An hour a week  &mdash;  what&rsquo;s the big deal?&#8221; &#8220;It&rsquo;s not an unreasonable request. &#8216;Women&rsquo; is like half the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many comments not quoted here could easily be considered racially offensive.</p>
<p>Despite the naysayers, Sisters&rsquo; Splash, as it&rsquo;s called, is not the only special accommodation that a college has made for Muslim students. George Washington already has foot baths for pre-prayer rituals, and a handful of other institutions  &mdash;  including the University of Michigan-Dearborn and George Mason University  &mdash;  have them as well. In 2008, at the request of female Muslim students, Harvard University ran a one-semester pilot program that reserved six hours a week for female students only at one of its lesser-used gyms, though the program was discontinued after that semester. There&rsquo;s also Gamma Gamma Chi Sorority Inc., an Islamic-based sorority that has five regional chapters, though not all are active.</p>
<p>Shelley Mountjoy, a doctoral student at George Mason who briefly attended George Washington as an undergraduate, doesn&rsquo;t much care what goes on at private colleges. But she takes issue with the foot baths at George Mason and with other religious accommodations at public universities. She is afraid that policies like the female-only swim hour will have a domino effect and spread to other colleges. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my tuition dollars paying to accommodate somebody&rsquo;s religion,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not the entire campus&rsquo;s religion. We don&rsquo;t all have to subscribe to Islamic law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because George Washington is a private university, there are no constitutional issues with the swim hour, said Ayesha N. Khan, legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Should a similar program start up at a public university, the presence of church-state issues would depend on the many facts of the situation, such as whether access is religion-specific, Khan said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students say the criticism is mostly coming from off-campus. Shaeera Tariq, a sophomore at George Washington and vice president of the Muslim Students&rsquo; Association, helped initiate the swim hour. She said nobody really knew about it until the Hatchet article came out  &mdash;  and as it happens, she is a reporter at the paper and she pitched the article to her editor. &#8220;It definitely sparked a lot of debate amongst people, but it seems to me there is a definite positive sentiment on campus and people are in favor of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not closing down the mall or something for an hour. We&rsquo;re just closing down a pool that wasn&rsquo;t used very often in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>John L. Esposito, an Islamic studies professor and founding director of Georgetown University&rsquo;s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, said many of the negative reactions undoubtedly stem from an &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I would have no problem with a women only pool hour but not a &#8220;Muslim only&#8221; pool hour. There are other religions that would welcome such a reserved time but it seems that the Muslims are instigating this and would probably make the other women so uncomfortable with stares and comments that they would leave. Also being a private institution they are free to instigate whatever rules and accomodations they want. For example- the gym I go to has a women only hour, a men only hour and a 55 and older hour. Any other time is designated &#8220;open plunge&#8221; </p>

The University could have denied the request on any number of reasons; discrimination, segregation, sexism, religious diversity, inclusion, etc.</p>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed and it should be ended. </p>
<p>If not, everyone has cause to seek their own swim periods based on their own criteria.<br>

		<p>Islamophobia? Maybe they hate Islam instead of fear it. But more likely they hate a political society with special rights for everyone but white men, Human rights for all but whites. </p>

		<p>I still wonder why the far left and Islamacists consider Islam a &#8220;race&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m Roman Catholic&hellip;does that make me a separate &#8220;racial group&#8221;?</p>
<p>And as far as the &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; label goes&hellip;I&rsquo;m not afraid of them, but as someone who supports gay rights and women&rsquo;s rights, I find them contemptible, bigoted, homophobic, sexist, and just plain wacko.</p>

		<p>I agree with Spartan24: as long as any women are allowed, even in the evil Western Bikini, this does not seem like a problem. If I were a woman I would welcome an hour at the pool that was free from the stares of men.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of converting to the Arab&rsquo;s Muslim religion.  </p>
<p>Just once I want to be able to successfully and victoriously claim I&rsquo;m a victim of racism when somebody criticizes or makes fun of my cultural expression.  </p>
<p>Right now, if I express my Dixie Pride, I&rsquo;m accused of being a Confedery Klu Klux.</p>
<p>I want to be on the winning side of the game for once, and given how the Musilms are intimidating us with the racism charge, that may be just the ticket- I can stay White and win at the race card game!</p>
<p>Is praying five times a day hard on the back?</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know how many non-muslim females would use the pool during the restricted times, but if there are enough of them that want to avoid the stares of men, but don&rsquo;t want to be around these muslim women with an attitude, might I suggest they go swimming in skimpy G-string bikinis. That ought to get those muslim women out of there, or at least if they complain, then they can&rsquo;t say Islamophobia, racism, whatever. It would only be an issue with their own uptightness.</p>

		<p>Since I lost a friend in the Twin Towers on 9/11, I am tired of all the special privilges, like this, given to moslems in the hope that they may become friends and not kill us. If moslems cannot respect our customs and laws, then they should get out of our country.<br>
   The moslems do not have any special skills or abilities. They are not needed. It is time for them to leave or be kicked out.</p>

		<p>Spartan24 it IS women only, not Muslim only. There are women only gyms like Curves specifically because some women want to work out without concern regarding makeup, cellulite, bulges in a swimsuite, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The &#8220;sisters&#8221; don&rsquo;t care if there are non-Muslim women at the pool, plus when it is all female everyone can wear regular swim suits without concern for modesty.</p>

<p>This may be so at GWU, but in Britain muslims often demand strict dress codes in public pools during muslim hours:</p>
<p>&rdquo;Under the rules, swimmers – including non-Muslims – are barred from entering the pool in normal swimming attire. </p>
<p>Instead they are told that they must comply with the &#8220;modest&#8221; code of dress required by Islamic custom, with women covered from the neck to the ankles and men, who swim separately, covered from the navel to the knees.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>Linnea- that&rsquo;s what I was talking about. Now it is a &#8220;women only&#8221; hour- next it will be demanding that the other women wear special &#8220;burkinis&#8221; or some other nonsense. I am familiar with Curves and other women only gyms- it is a great idea for women who are- for whatever reason- uncomfortable being in more revealing clothing like workout or swimming gear around men. Just as an aside- when Curves tried a similar concept for men it flopped! </p>

		<p>I would be interested to know if these &#8220;muslim women&#8221; are simply black American muslim converts which is to say, not real muslims but just in it for the ghetto/religious lottery. REAL muslim (Kuwaitia, Saudia and Afghan women usually bail out of the ideaology if the manage to get to America whereas American blacks convert because they really have no idea what the muslim ideology is about. I suspect that if sharia becomes prevelant in Americastan, the loud, rowdy, disrespectful, disdainful, drinking and partying black women are gonna get a BIG surprise.</p>

		<p>Muslim women are property first and foremost. The ideals of the equality of the sexes are not applicable. Some women can get used to being property, feeling they will be taken care of in that instance, but inevitably the second class status has its price: female genital mutilation, polygamy, strict dress codes, honor killings and rapes.<br>
I see the duality every day in Minneapolis. I am associated with the schools here, and the Somali girls are always - always - dressed in scarves and assorted drapes, hot days or cold. The boys are preferentially allowed to dress as they want. Frankly I am dismayed, to the point of despair, that the American system allows this. The next generations of Americans will be nothing like those preceding them, although of course the public schools will deny this. They will be facing, and will be faced down by, nations such as Japan, Korea and China very far ahead of us in science and technology. <br>
The only hope for this country is a reorganization along the lines of ethnocentricity. This is the type of society the leading edge Eastern nations have become, and their influence may begin to be felt here, although I have no doubt the controlled media will frantically block that realization. American Exceptionalism will be trotted out time and again as the counter message; although frankly why any nation would conclude itself exceptional in a good sense when its fortunes have seen such reverses is beyond me.</p>

<p>The first sentence of the article says that, then the rest of the article goes case by case and says each facility that was questioned about the rule backed down from it and allowed western dress in same sex swim sessions.</p>
<p>They might be radical groups that want to make up rules but that IS what they are doing, those rules do not apply in the strictest of Muslim countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc&hellip;) so if some groups in the U.K. are trying to imply it is required they are making stuff up (which is why they apparently backed down in every case when questioned on it).</p>

		<p>The University of Michigan installed &#8220;footbaths&#8221; for their muslim &#8220;students&#8221;.<br>
These &#8220;footbaths&#8221; make dandy urinals as one&rsquo;s &#8220;aim&#8221; does not have to be quite as accurate.<br>
I have yet to have a muslim challenge me on my use of these &#8220;footbaths&#8221;.<br>
If I am &#8220;challenged&#8221;, I will merely state that in MY country, they are known as urinals.<br>
