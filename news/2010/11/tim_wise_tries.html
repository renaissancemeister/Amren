<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tim Wise has a new post today trying to talk his way out of his vicious glee at the thought of the hearts of conservative white people stopping.</p>
<p>{snip}<blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve long known that the same kind of miscomprehension often greets my own writing. First, I focus on touchy subjects like race, and whenever we delve into such matter as this, there is a chance that emotional reading may take the place of reasoned study and analysis. In other words, we see what we want to see, based on wherever we are at the time of the reading, emotionally, and with regard to the issues at hand. Interestingly, the same phenomenon is true for writers, whose work product  &mdash;  or &#8220;art&#8221; on our better days  &mdash;  also reflects our emotional state at any given moment. In other words, sometimes the writer chooses language that is deliberately hyperbolic, provocative, or edgy, so as to force a reaction  &mdash;  to force an examination of the underlying message, no matter how discomfiting it may be for all involved  &mdash;  and doesn&rsquo;t give much regard to how it may be received. Like the writer of the reading comprehension questions on the PSAT, such writers know ahead of time that many readers simply won&rsquo;t get it.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>No, Tim. I majored in literature in college. Your essay was in the form of teasing people who are condemned to death by execution. &#8220;Tick tock&#8221; and all that, and it&rsquo;s also a reference to heartbeats.</p>
<p>Wait! I was just about to refer to your essay to get the reference to hearts of White folks stopping It&rsquo;s not on your site anymore! You took it out! But it is all over the Internet. The full version of your essay is all over the place, Tim! <a href="/news/2010/11/an_open_letter_2.html" target="wise" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>Here it is,</b></a> which we&rsquo;ll be sending to the colleges where you hope to lecture in the future:<blockquote>&#147;We just have to be patient.</p>
<p>And wait for your hearts to stop beating.</p>
<p>And stop they will.</p>
<p>And for some of you, real damned soon truth be told.</p>
<p>Do you hear it?&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Well, your essay is viral all right, and it&rsquo;s not principally elderly White people who are talking about it. You are hoping the &#8220;white right&#8221; is dying off? Haha.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So you had to turn off comments, edit your original essay, and write an essay trying to claim that &#8220;we misinterpreted your words.&#8221; Oh boo hoo. How about every public White person who&rsquo;s been accused of &#8220;racism.&#8221; He always tries to say, &#8220;you misinterpreted my words.&#8221; And people like you, Tim, are always ready to deny any wiggle room to anyone accused of &#8220;racism,&#8221; for their &#8220;slip of the tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ambiguity in &#8220;tick tock&#8221; and &#8220;wait for your hearts to stop, and stop they will.&#8221; No. This is celebrating the extinction of the White race.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Tim Wise, timwose.org, November 4, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Here&rsquo;s something I never imagined I would say:</p>
<p>I think I know what it feels like to be the person who writes the reading comprehension questions for those standardized tests we&rsquo;re so fond of giving, if quite a bit less fond of taking.</p>
<p>After all, think about that person for a minute. He or she writes four or five paragraphs for inclusion on the PSAT or whatever, knowing full well that when asked questions about the passage they just read, millions of those who are taking the test will not get the point. It must be difficult to write, all the while aware that large numbers of those reading your work will utterly fail to comprehend it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long known that the same kind of miscomprehension often greets my own writing. First, I focus on touchy subjects like race, and whenever we delve into such matter as this, there is a chance that emotional reading may take the place of reasoned study and analysis. In other words, we see what we want to see, based on wherever we are at the time of the reading, emotionally, and with regard to the issues at hand. Interestingly, the same phenomenon is true for writers, whose work product  &mdash;  or &#8220;art&#8221; on our better days  &mdash;  also reflects our emotional state at any given moment. In other words, sometimes the writer chooses language that is deliberately hyperbolic, provocative, or edgy, so as to force a reaction  &mdash;  to force an examination of the underlying message, no matter how discomfiting it may be for all involved  &mdash;  and doesn&rsquo;t give much regard to how it may be received. Like the writer of the reading comprehension questions on the PSAT, such writers know ahead of time that many readers simply won&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>That said, and while I know we live in a culture where reading comprehension (and writing itself) is devalued  &mdash;  what with our emphasis on short, sweet text messages, or tweet-talk, in which we are expected to make a point in 140 characters  &mdash;  I am yet amazed at how difficult some find it to decipher the words I have caused to appear on the page, and to really interpret what they mean, as opposed to that which they do not.</p>
<p>To wit, after my latest piece on the election results went viral, there have been more than a few folks who have written to say how appalled they were by my &#8220;attack on white people,&#8221; or my &#8220;attack on America,&#8221; or my &#8220;hateful diatribe&#8221; in which I &#8220;gleefully anticipate the death of the elderly&#8221; and the &#8220;initiation of violent payback of whites writ large by people of color&#8221; once whites become a less prominent portion of the national population, a few decades hence. In other words, putting aside the inherent absurdity of this interpretation  &mdash;  I am white after all, as are my kids, as is my wife, as is my momma, all my immediate family and my best friend too  &mdash;  some who read the piece believe against all logic and in the face of plain English (however aggressive the piece may be), that I have announced, excitedly, the coming of a glorious race war and the end of white people.</p>
<p>(Sigh).</p>
<p>So perhaps we should start with the obvious, for those a bit too slow to begin the reading of the essay with, ya know, the title. For if one reads the title, &#8220;An Open Letter to the White Right, On the Occasion of Your Recent, Successful Temper Tantrum,&#8221; one would almost immediately discover an important nugget of relevant information; information that rather clearly spells out who is being critiqued in the piece, and thus, to whom my ire is being directed. It is not white people. It is not the white elderly. It is the white right, as in right-wing. And given the timing of the essay  &mdash;  released the evening of the mid-term elections, in which the right (mostly on the backs of heavy white conservative turnout) managed to capture the House of Representatives and make substantial inroads throughout government, from the Senate to state houses across the nation  &mdash;  it should be obvious that, more precisely, I am taking aim at the Tea Party types who take their electoral triumphs as evidence that they have &#8220;taken their country back&#8221; from the evil leftist/Marxist/fascist/Kenyan-Muslim hordes who had previously hijacked it.</p>
<p>To believe that I am condemning all white people in this essay requires an incapacity for rational thought almost too stunning to contemplate. I specify the white right, and I even go on to note that a &#8220;sizable minority&#8221; of whites (including myself) will, in the future, stand against the kind of reactionary whiteness embodied by those to whom I was directing my verbal wrath. So by definition, I&rsquo;m assuming that not all whites are deserving of this critique, because not all whites buy into the reactionary agenda.</p>
<p>Although I do say that the white right that triumphed on election night is disproportionately composed of &#8220;older white folks beholden to an absurd, inaccurate, nostalgic fantasy of what America used to be like,&#8221; this does not mean that I &#8220;hate elderly white people.&#8221; Nor is it  &mdash;  and let&rsquo;s just head this off at the pass right now  &mdash;  an indication that all those claims about leftist &#8220;death panels&#8221; euthanizing grandma were accurate after all. First, just because the white right is disproportionately older (and this isn&rsquo;t a debatable point, frankly), doesn&rsquo;t mean that I think all older white folks are members of the white right. Many are not. Indeed, many of those in the same generation as the aging tea baggers were among the principal white allies within the civil rights struggle. That generation, like all generations, has its good and bad. They are neither all heroic nor all venal. Obviously.</p>
<p>Nor does my mention that this bunch of older right-wing white folks are &#8220;dying&#8221;  &mdash;  nor my insistence at various points that this will be a good thing for the nation and the world  &mdash;  mean that I hope they die soon, or am cheering their physical obsolescence. Simply put, it is just a fact: generations come and go, and within a few decades, all those white folks who have the luxury of clinging from first hand experience to the nostalgic past of the 50s, and the days we often refer to as &#8220;American innocence&#8221; will be gone. And although I wish them all a long and healthy life (even if I might prefer that fewer of them vote), this passing will, when it comes, make it easier to move forward on a whole host of efforts for social justice. The nostalgic remembrance of the pre-civil rights era by millions of white people  &mdash;  folks who never had to really contemplate how hellish those days were for people of color  &mdash;  is an impediment to progress. Unlike merely remembering fondly one&rsquo;s childhood, which is normal and natural and usually healthy I suppose, nostalgia is a political matter, often blinding us to the more complex reality, creating tunnel vision and eradicating altogether the peripheral comprehension needed to interpret our world.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe their historical memory is blinkered, absurd and dangerous. And I think this makes them dangerous, in turn. And I think it will be a good thing when we are no longer hampered as a society by those who have the capacity to so thoroughly misremember a time that they themselves lived through, and in which so many of them did nothing to move the country forward (and in fact, often stood in the way of human and civil rights for so many). But I am not, therefore, hoping for their death. I am simply noting the inevitable and commenting on what it will, in my estimation, mean. I am making the point that they should enjoy their political victory while they can. Because soon, within a few decades, their type (again, in political terms, not just racial terms) will be finished. To the extent the right has all but given up on attracting significant numbers of people of color to their movement  &mdash;  and by virtue of their anti-immigrant hysteria, all but ensured the increasing whiteness of their clique  &mdash;  this becomes an almost incontestable fact. If half the population in the U.S. will be people of color in, say, 40 years, then even a decent minority of progressive white folks, combined with a heavily progressive population of color will be able to eviscerate the white right, in political terms. Saying this isn&rsquo;t hateful. It&rsquo;s just true. One is free to look forward to those coming days, or to be afraid of them, but either way, those days are coming.</p>
<p>I will grant you, some of the wording I chose for the piece was intemperate, and upon greater reflection, there are no doubt words and phrases I could have chosen that would have conveyed this same core message, perhaps more effectively. That&rsquo;s how it goes sometimes when you&rsquo;re trying to speak your truth: it&rsquo;s raw, unfiltered, and not always beholden to strategic considerations. Fine.</p>
<p>But because one may disagree with my tone in places, or certain language used, or wish I hadn&rsquo;t conflated the concepts of political and physical death in such a way as to make it unclear what I was cheering  &mdash;  the former or the latter  &mdash;  should not therefore make it acceptable to fundamentally misinterpret the underlying meaning of the message: a meaning which is still quite clear, or so it seems to me, tone and language notwithstanding.<br>

		<p>Brevity is the soul of wit, Mr. Wise, especially given your poor, benighted white target readership; why didn&rsquo;t you just declare, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t really hate you, you redneck dumbasses - you just have problems with reading comprehension!&#8221;  That&rsquo;s all this white guy comprehended from your &#8220;explanation&#8221; - perhaps you need to pen yet another..?</p>

		<p>Amazing.  His &#8220;apology&#8221; or &#8220;clarification&#8221; is just as hateful, belittling, and sneering as his original brain fart.  Bottom line - he says he ONLY meant he wished for the death of the &#8220;white right&#8221;.  Oh, that makes all the difference!  How about we &#8220;only&#8221; wish for the death of the Black Congressional Caucus folks?  Would that be okay according to his reasoning?  Well of course not.  This guy is a prime example of how some folks can be way over educated, but still be more stupid than the dumbest people (in his mind) he lampoons.  Seems the more educated one gets, at least in something  like journalism, or phys ed, or &#8220;humanities&#8221; (as opposed to physics, engineering, something useful and hard) the dumber and more hateful they too often get.  Why?  Because Liberal Arts is just that - a full indoctrination into the Liberal hateful mindset.  This guy is a prime example of more education not resulting in  rational thought, or more &#8220;tolerance&#8221; or more &#8220;rounding out&#8221; of the personality.<br>

		<p>Too late Timmy, we know have a record of your real thoughts with your signature on it.  My own position about hate is that it is a normal emotion, everyone hates something!  You can&rsquo;t know love without hate, etc.  But for those like you who seem to be pushing for a sort of Orwellian &#8220;Ministry of Love&#8221; that will not tolerate &#8220;hate&#8221; as defined by your political thoughts on various issues, your diatribe will be added to the collection of online matter that witnesses in volumes, the sort of hate Leftest can conjur up.  It matches up well with the sort of language Moa and Stalin used to murder millions of their own people.  Anyone that can write the way you did is just a moment away from pulling a trigger, or a lever.  You can&rsquo;t be trusted by ANYONE.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to know he&rsquo;s not cheering the extinction of ALL white people but only those who don&rsquo;t adhere to his own political orthodoxy. As long as we agree with him, Mr. Wise and his minions will stay their hand. As long as we denounce and debase our race, we should be safe.</p>
<p>Mr. Wise has apparently seen too many K and Nazi documentaries and has learned to think like his imaginary enemies.</p>

		<p>To be fair, those who claim the original said Mr. Wise wants nothing but the oblivion of the white race are very mistaken.  He&rsquo;s just fine with whites who agree with him (after, as another commenter noted, who else will buy his books?).  It&rsquo;s those whites in staunch disagreement with him he&rsquo;d like to see expire.</p>

<p>Comrade Wise considers this an apology?</p>
<p>He again misses a fundamental point; he is still looking to &ldquo;eviscerate&rdquo; something, this time it is only the &ldquo;white right,&rdquo; which he made very clear before and continues to do so above, if less brazenly and vulgarly so, as being any white human being that is not a &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; and votes Republican. Moreover, he continues to call for the eventual genocide of the white race via demographics and politics in the USA, only through a more &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; and incremental application of multiculturalism. There is no mistaking this, for that is multiculturalism&rsquo;s goal: replacing &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; whites with an &ldquo;underprivileged&rdquo; nonwhite majority, and calling that &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is amusing and interesting to see one of these hateful fools having to beg forgiveness and &ldquo;apologize;&rdquo; it is also instructive. There is no real apology here or any compromise either within Comrade Wise, at all. It simply seems he has recovered from &ldquo;sipping&rdquo; the Five O&rsquo;Clock Vodka and wishes he had only had a few Pabst Blue Ribbons instead. </p>
<p>On another note, the above author in the first article (by &#8220;mindweapon,&#8221; Fair and Delightsome, Tim Wise Tries To Edit His Hate,) makes a really good point when he writes:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Wait! I was just about to refer to your essay to get the reference to hearts of White folks stopping It&rsquo;s not on your site anymore! You took it out! But it is all over the Internet. The full version of your essay is all over the place, Tim! Here it is, which we&rsquo;ll be sending to the colleges where you hope to lecture in the future&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comrade Wise was invited to a voluntary seminar on &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural competence,&rdquo; where I work about two years ago. I didn&rsquo;t go then, but now I would; I will be saving a copy of his original tirade of tolerance, for future use should he ever be invited back for an encore of his &ldquo;affirmative&rdquo; atrocities. Oh, what fun I might have.<br>
 <br>
All the best my good people, </p>
<p>John PM!</p>

		<p>What this clown writes is so bizarre, illogical and so obviously mentally disturbed, I quit reading anything he puts out.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a liberal out there that has a persuasive argument, based in sound reasoning and intelligent thought, I have no objection to examining what he has to say.</p>
<p>But I can &#8216;t think of a single one who fits that description.  They run the gamut from some moronic black who thinks a black hole in space is racist to the clown above who has a tenuous grasp on sanity.</p>
<p>And the politicians are worse.  Whether it&rsquo;s Grandmother Harry Reid who gets a &#8220;warm feeling,&#8221; when he thinks about mestizos voting democrat, obviously unaware they&rsquo;re doing so, because they expect amnesty and more freebies or Scary Nancy Pelosi who declared victory after the election slaughter last Tuesday, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious both of these mentally disturbed people live in some kind of fantasy world of their own creation.</p>
<p>That they were able to get elected indicates to what extent we have a large population of people who are wacky themselves.  It&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re living on borrowed time as an empire and a nation.</p>

		<p>Johann Von Goethe, a white guy if ever there was one, once said that there wasn&rsquo;t a negative emotion or antisocial thought that he hadn&rsquo;t harbored at one time or another in his mind. Gotta be careful before pushing &#8220;Print,&#8221; though, or before acting out on your basest emotions as so many non-white people love to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe this was written by a white person. Does he live in the ghetto and somehow believe that his neighbors are perfectly honorable people, misunderstood by us racist whites who don&rsquo;t want to associate with them?</p>
<p>Nope. This guy blew it, and he wants to backpedal. Too late. Now he has no friends. The non-whites never respected him anyway, and neither do we.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s made me even angrier with this pathetic addendum.  He states unequivocally that himself and the white &#8220;progressives&#8221; are indeed the only good white people and he doesn&rsquo;t wish death and displacement on all whites, only on right wing white people.  Tim Wise is as he always was, a diseased leftist.  </p>
<p>I wonder if life in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s was the terror filled existence for blacks that Wise says it was.  I have reason to doubt.  Today, long after &#8220;civil rights&#8221; blacks are dropping out of high school at the highest rate in history, going to jail and having children out of wedlock multiple times what they were in those &#8220;dark times&#8221;.  Two parent black families are almost non-existent compared to what they were before civil rights.  How can Wise explain that.  He can&rsquo;t.  He can only fantasize about the coming &#8220;brown tide&#8221; that will, according to him, wash away whiteness.  I have my doubts about that as well.  For people like him, the clock is indeed ticking louder and louder.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;If half the population in the U.S. will be people of color in, say, 40 years, then even a decent minority of progressive white folks, combined with a heavily progressive population of color will be able to eviscerate the white right, in political terms. Saying this isn&rsquo;t hateful. It&rsquo;s just true. One is free to look forward to those coming days, or to be afraid of them, but either way, those days are coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t count on it Timmy. By &#8220;progressive&#8221; you mean socialist and I have news for you, the USA will go broke and collapse long before mid-century unless we enact fiscally conservative policies. There won&rsquo;t be any money for your &#8220;progressiveness&#8221;. Also, don&rsquo;t count on Brown people being half the country mid-century or even close, a lot and I do mean a lot can change.</p>

		<p>Tim Wise has done white people, especially older white people, a great favor. In case they ever get soft in the head and believe that blacks actually like or have any respect for them, they can think back on Mr. Wise&rsquo;s little diatribe and recall what the truth actually is. In a moment of emotional pique Tim Wise chose to vent his true feelings - feelings that, I&rsquo;m quite sure, many members of his race share. He said it all, and there&rsquo;s no need for any further examination. He&rsquo;s entitled to his feelings. I&rsquo;m glad that he&rsquo;s reminded me of how he and many of the members of his race feel about me and my race. </p>
<p>But I won&rsquo;t buy the nonsense that I misinterpreted anything that he said. He said it simply and clearly. I&rsquo;d actually think more of Mr. Wise if he had the courage to own his feelings and not try to backpedal on what he said. Be a man, Mr. Wise! Own up to what you said. I am an accomplished reader. I know what I read. I will not ever accept that you didn&rsquo;t mean it. You said it! Own it! </p>
<p>Whenever I read anything by you in the future or whenever I hear your name I will remember your wish that I be dead or eliminated from this planet. I&#8221;ll think of that whenever I see a member of your race. I can&rsquo;t help feeling any other way - just as you can&rsquo;t. You have put things back in perspective for me.</p>

		<p>He seems to think the right is dying - how wrong he is.  All sides of the right-wing, from the centre-right, to the Tea Party movement, to nationalism and racial consciousness, are gaining in strength day by day.  The recent mid-term elections are proof of this, and elections in Europe over the past few years are proof that this great shift to the right which we are about to experience is truly far-reaching.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it goes sometimes when you&rsquo;re trying to speak your truth: it&rsquo;s raw, unfiltered, and not always beholden to strategic considerations. Fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might remember that Comrade Timmy, the next time you (age 42) declare the &ldquo;old order&rdquo; just quite so old and dead. There are different &ldquo;strategic considerations&rdquo; also, like the ones that a younger man such as myself might consider strategic. These being that the fanciful Cosby Show, the Oprah Winfrey horror show, and such absurd things as The George Lopez show, have nothing to offer me or anyone younger than myself but a nostalgia for: Leave it to Beaver; The Munsters; The Twilight Zone; or even, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Friends, and SCTV. </p>

		<p>To a stretch, I can empathize with Tim Wise.  One problem with the internet and its relative anonymity is that it gives too many people the ability to let their keyboards run ahead of their brains.  Unfortunately for him, just as the Romans had a saying, &#8220;In Vino Veritas,&#8221; (the truth in wine, i.e. drunks tend to tell the truth, because they lose their inhibition and their discretion in the alcohol), it is similarly true that there is truth in anger.  Wise exposed himself for what we knew him to be all along in his &#8220;fire ready aim&#8221; rant of a few days ago.</p>
<p>Object lesson is that you can&rsquo;t un-ring a bell, especially on the internet.  Whenever you read an extremist left-winger let go of such a &#8220;fire ready aim&#8221; rant like Wise did, save it to your hard drive.  So when they scrub it, you can pull it back up to show what they originally said.  A local example from St. Louis:</p>

<p>Liberalism is American Nazism,  white people are its victims, and the Democratic Party is its political front.   There&rsquo;s a direct line between the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; industry and assaults in the street,  and yet Conservatism never lifts a finger to put people like Wise,  who no doubt gets taxpayer money on occasion, out of business.  </p>

<p>Backpedaling furiously, a chastened Saint Timothy the Un-Wise now tries to tell us that, oh no, he didn&rsquo;t REALLY say he wanted whites to die; he wasn&rsquo;t REALLY advocating White Genocide. It was all a mistake on our part for  being too dim to apprehend the subtleties of a brilliant mind like Tim Wise&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Wise&rsquo;s explanation, or alibi, is (as far as I can tell) that he&rsquo;s not ACTIVELY calling for the deaths of white people; he&rsquo;s just PASSIVELY cheering all of us on to hurry up and expire of natural causes. Which, according to Tim, will be from too much Pabst for the poorer among us; and too much Scotch for the richer among us. So apparently his MO is NOT to encourage nonwhites to commit Genocide on white people; but rather to wait for us to eliminate ourselves&hellip; while applauding from the sidelines and high-fiving with his buds from da hood. </p>
<p>Sorry to disappoint you, Tim, but I for one don&rsquo;t drink nearly enough to drink myself to death. I&rsquo;m in excellent health, physically strong, in the prime of life, and very, VERY far from moribund   &mdash;   so if you want me dead, you&rsquo;re going to have to kill me yourself. You&rsquo;re going to have to kill a lot of us, Tim. Have you really thought about how many of us you&rsquo;re going to have to kill? Have you? Realistically, you&rsquo;re going to have to kill TENS OF MILLIONS of people   &mdash;   many of whom are among the most heavily armed citizens of any country in the world. Think you and your little Diversity Training Workshop comrages are up to that task? I got news for you: you&rsquo;re not. </p>
<p>If I were you, Tim, I&rsquo;d be worried about time running out, too. Because time is running out on the notion of a rainbow-flavored fantasy land that various hippy-dippy dreamers like you have been promising us for four-plus decades. Every new day of the Obamanation means more and more whites dumping their multikulti delusions for Race Realism. How many whites who voted Democratic in 2008 who did not in 2010? And how many MORE whites will not come 2012?</p>
<p>So ask not for whom the clock tick-tocks, Timmy. It tick-tocks for thee. </p>

Mr. Taylor was banned from cable news for making the comment that Hispanics who stand around for long periods of time waiting for work, sometimes urinate in public.</p>
<p>Mr. Wise has appeared on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, C-Span, etc. He  will NOT be banned from cable or public air waves. As a matter of fact, his stock and marketability will likely rise because he was &#8216;speaking truth to power&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Should you see Mr. Wise on any program, I urge you to send them email including a copy of his original diatribe. If he is scheduled to appear at your campus or school, give his original blog to everyone in charge and copies to your local media. Make sure they know this guy is gleefully celebrating the end of Whites in America. Ask them how an &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; is allowed to preach such hatred toward whites.</p>

		<p>Mr. Wise and his ilk are angry that the blinders are coming off the eyes of white people. The Tea Party may not be organized, yet, but they are a sign of things to come. </p>
<p>Mr. Wise and his ilk have been carrying out a program of white genocide for years. That&rsquo;s what the Karl Marx Frankfurt School for Social Reform was all about. Wise does not say anything about us that does not come from the Frankfurt School classroom. It&rsquo;s all about White genocide.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve fought for this country before and we will fight for it again.  Not only that, but those Blacks and Browns may decide they don&rsquo;t like men like Wise and his ilk. If Tim Wise hates people like good, decent white people what&rsquo;s to keep him from hating Blacks and Browns? </p>

		<p>Tim Wise is not Black.  He was born in Nashville, Tennessee to a Jewish father and a mother of Scottish or Irish ancestry (maiden name McLean).</p>
<p>My question is:  what caused him to have this deep dislike for Whites which he justifies in his brain as being virtuous?  Was it the books he read in his youth or the way he was raised or perhaps unhappy life experiences?</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, it doesn&rsquo;t seem normal to want your own genetic kind to die, miscegenate into nothingness, or to be a resented and powerless minority. </p>
<p>If White children were mean to Mr. Wise when he was a boy, I am terribly sorry.  All of us have unhappy memories, but we have to put them behind us and learn to love in the here and now.  Really, working towards the destruction of your own people is like trying to destroy yourself.  </p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Wise needs counseling to understand his true motives, which even he doesn&rsquo;t quite understand at this time.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m the poster from Fair and Delightsome, and was very pleased to see my post reposted here.</p>
<p>My 2 cents is that it&rsquo;s a matter of overcoming the Psy-Ops of the Left.  I was in military intelligence in the Army, and when I was at linguist school in Monterey, I knew some people who were in Psy-Ops, and it made a big impression on me   &mdash;   that there is a whole large Army unit devoted to Psychological Operations   &mdash;   Mind-War.  They&rsquo;ve come a long way since dropping leaflets of course   &mdash;   the whole mass media industry is a form of psychological warfare being waged on us.</p>
<p>The big picture view is that the mass media implants a certain form of reality in our heads.  Forget content for a moment, and let&rsquo;s talk about the form.</p>
<p>This form, or formula, is something like this &#8220;setup, conflict, montage, setback, conflict, montage, car chase, gunfight, another car chase, apparent victory, last minute setback, final victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice even Tim Wise thinks like this.  From the post under discussion:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the bad guy in every horror movie ever made, who gets shot five times, or stabbed ten, or blown up twice, and who will eventually pass  &mdash;  even if it takes four sequels to make it happen  &mdash;  but who in the meantime keeps coming back around, grabbing at our ankles as we walk by, we having been mistakenly convinced that you were finally dead this time.</p>
<p>Fair enough, and have at it. But remember how this movie ends.</p>
<p>Our ankles survive.</p>
<p>You do not.<br>
END QUOTE</p>
<p>Notice what is implied here   &mdash;   that movies imitate reality.  Do they really?</p>
<p>To the extent that people are brainwashed and act out their life like a movie, this is true.  For example, movies about &#8220;hollywood nazis&#8221; led thousands of discontented American white kids to to dress and act a certain way, and created a certain unhealthy subculture.</p>
<p>The main reason White Americans are losing ground is because the Psychological Operations of TV and movies has instilled anti-intellectualism in White American culture.  Being an intellectual is associated with being liberal, effete, wimpy, &#8220;nerdy,&#8221; or &#8220;geeky,&#8221;   &mdash;   in general someone who will not receive social rewards.  Also, White fathers are depicted as lame losers   &mdash;   at best.  The mass media propagandizes to White teenage boys to be hedonists and never grow up   &mdash;   something like media figure &#8220;kid rock.&#8221;  Notice even in his name &#8220;kid&#8221;   &mdash;   in other words, don&rsquo;t grow up and be responsible.  Just be a hedonist man child and you&rsquo;ll have all the fun and get all the girls, and really, what else is there?</p>
<p>Besides the obvious   &mdash;   reducing consumption of mass media, what to do?</p>
<p>My answer is the Culture of Learning/Culture of Prosperity/Tribal Business Networking.  We should see ourselves as competing for the Asian-American niches   &mdash;   owning convenience stores and doing graduate degrees in sciences/engineering/medical.</p>
<p>The one advantage we can have is that Asians study hard because of family pressure, and a lot of them are miserable.  It&rsquo;s much better if you can love learning.  I teach my kid math, and we actually enjoy it.  We just do about 20 minutes a day, solve 1 or 2 problems, and then I say, &#8220;Great job, see that, you&rsquo;re smart.&#8221;  Once a day, I want to see that light bulb light up, and then she can move on to her kid stuff.  Eventually I won&rsquo;t have to spoon feed it to her   &mdash;   she&rsquo;ll become a math geek on her own.</p>
<p>Having both parents work, or worse, divorce, has been a big problem that made us more vulnerable to the Psy-Ops.  White families need to own convenience stores, so the kids can go hang out with their parents after school and study math, instead of being abandoned latch-key kids left to the tender mercies of our Lord of the Flies youth culture.  Why should Indians own every single convenience store?  They never sponsor the local Little Leagues or participate in the community at all  They are just there to suck up money.  White families should own those convenience stores and home-school their kids at the store.</p>
<p>Most liberals, I&rsquo;ve found, have some kind of weird psychological complexes.  Mentally healthy people naturally recoil at being told that they are somehow &#8220;evil&#8221; for being White and normal.</p>
<p>So it boils down to this   &mdash;   we need to raise mentally healthy children with strongly cultivated intellects, especially in math and science.  That&rsquo;s how we win this fight.  It doesn&rsquo;t involve gun fights or car chases.  Maybe it sounds boring, but this is it.</p>

Before the civil rights legislation was signed one could attribute high rates of black crime and illegitimacy, and inferior academic performance to racial discrimination.  From 1965 to 1975 dissatisfaction with the War in Vietnam pushed white liberals to the left, and induced them to forgive the black ghetto riots.  <br>

		<p>The left, in the face of political disappointment and frustration, is lashing out in mindless, pointless desperation.  Unable to accept the tremendous backlash from the right, self-named progressives are turning inward and stewing in their own juices.  Take the commentators on MSNBC, who got 1.95 million viewers on election night to Fox&rsquo;s 7 mil.  They&rsquo;re rationalizing that a smaller, more leftist Congressional Democratic caucus will be stronger than a more moderate majority one.  One has to wonder whether Olbermann went completely bonkers when he broke company rules and donated money to three Dems.  (Why not have someone else give the dough for him?)  Anyway, the MSNBC crowd is like middle-school misfits who circle the wagons and make fun of everyone else.<br>
And, for a good example of how out of touch liberals can be: Mike Kinsley was on Washington Journal to discuss a piece he wrote for Politico.  A viewer called in to castigate him for using the term &#8220;tea-baggers&#8221; in the article.  He said he had been blindsided by numerous such complaints and couldn&rsquo;t understand why the term was objectionable.  He appeared to be genuinely perplexed and dismayed.

		<p>The problem with the Tea Party denouncing this guy is nil, except just to brush him off with a, &#8220;he is just a nut case so ignore him, etc&#8221;. The same goes for Hannity, Levin, Rush, Beck, etc. if they even dare mention him or the article. They will just laugh it off as usual. White conservatives seem to not care about the vitriol directed at them from all sides, nor take anything seriously in what these jerks say. They are afraid of facing any racial truths and will avoid it at all costs and will never alert Whites to the dangers they face as a race. They are too busy being &#8220;all inclusive&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This guy was invited to speak at my school last week as part of the University&rsquo;s new Diversity and Inclusiveness initiative. I wonder if they are regretting sending an email to the entire university community encouraging them to attend. I figured that he was type that thinks everything can be solved by dialogue, but I guess not. Now I wonder if he will have to write an apology to the NAACP about this line, which is pretty illuminating:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am white after all, as are my kids, as is my wife, as is my momma, all my immediate family and my best friends too&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Too late Timmy, we know have a record of your real thoughts with your signature on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim Wise has done white people, especially older white people, a great favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right! Exactly! 1000 %! That is the true thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc., of Mr. Wise. that is what he is thinking and wants to think too. He has shown us what he is all about and what he does desire.</p>
<p>And from Timmy himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;sometimes the writer chooses language that is deliberately hyperbolic, provocative, or edgy, so as to force a reaction &mdash; to force an examination of the underlying message, no matter how discomfiting it may be for all involved&#8221;</p>
<p>NOT provocative, hyperbolic, edgy, etc. True right on without any hesitation on his part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cry my a river&#8221;!</p>
<p>OH, we just don&rsquo;t get it all, we have failed reading comprehension. NO, we have passed it very well.</p>

		<p>This hate screed of Wise&rsquo;s must follow him around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point of the attempt to &#8220;walk back&#8221; his piece, after all. It&rsquo;s not that he cares whether people &#8220;misunderstand&#8221; - this is about protecting his livelihood.</p>
<p>Remember, this guy makes his living being a professional &#8220;race issues&#8221; figure. He walks a tightrope of being progressive enough to be at the forefront of the latest anti-racist efforts and yet not so radical as to expose the repellant core of the anti-racism cult for what it really is - extremely hostile to white Americans to the point of literally wanting to impoverish and dispossess them. </p>
<p>His fear is that his slip is showing. He&rsquo;s walking back his essay because he knows that something this extreme could cost him some speaking gigs, some appearances on cable news, leading some publicly funded &#8220;diversity training&#8221; sessions and so on.</p>
<p>This essay must follow this guy around. Keep reminding the world who Tim Wise really is: a nasty little person who longs for the death of white conservatives. Should a person like this be invited on TV as a sane voice? Should a person like this get public money for his opinion?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting paragraph on Wise&rsquo;s site:</p>
<p>&#8220;And seriously, if you don&rsquo;t like what I have to say, cool. Go write a rebuttal piece, on your own site, or on some properly inflammatory web board. Have at it. No big deal. The strange and bullying tendencies that some folks have  &mdash;  which compel them to invade another person&rsquo;s space and become abusive to them  &mdash;  is something I will never understand. It is something for which medication may be the only solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone else think that &#8220;strange &amp; bullying tendencies&#8221; sort of sums up the dynamic of race relations in the US today&hellip;? The line &#8220;invade another person&rsquo;s space and become abusive to them&#8221; certainly describes so many dangerous black slums that used to be nice, safe, white neighborhoods just a few years ago.  Think Detroit, or my grandparents&rsquo; neighborhood in Philadelphia.</p>

		<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem normal to want your own genetic kind to die, miscegenate into nothingness, or to be a resented and powerless minority. <br>
Really, working towards the destruction of your own people is like trying to destroy yourself. <br>
    &mdash;    Everyone Needs Love (#24)</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Such a naive post! You don&rsquo;t understand this AT ALL.<br>
Mr. Wise is not working for the destruction of HIS OWN PEOPLE. He is working for the destruction oF YOURS!  Can&rsquo;t you understand?  He doesn&rsquo;t consider himself one of your people. He despises you and doesn&rsquo;t identify with you. You are The Enemy. He hates you. </p>
<p>His case is not at all unusual. Maybe he felt rejected or alienated as a child. Maybe he felt like he was the odd one and resolved to get even. Just look at Obama for another case of the half-breed who rejects his white side and identifies with his minority side. This is the standard way it goes. Mixed-breeds usually identify with their minority side and very often hate the other.  Their unhapppy minds can be very twisted. Just because they are part something, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they love that something.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t read very much of this, the other day. And his more recent effort to fan the stink away is just as unreadable.  The feeling I got from both &#8216;works&rsquo; reminded me of trying to converse with someone who is criminally insane. But I did do a google Image Search on him.  Oh MY!  Such fey little poses!  He&rsquo;s ever-so-&#8216;cute&rsquo;!  </p>
<p>And is he wearing makeup to mask the redness of his eyelids?  I couldn&rsquo;t quite tell.  There seems to be a rash of that going on, these days.  What a pity.  I think pink skin is beautiful, and can&rsquo;t imagine being ashamed of having it.  </p>
<p>Here in Mississippi, we have a problem with Jewish men marrying truly dumb Shiksas, from the dumbest white racial subgroup in Western Europe (We&rsquo;ve had a Brain Drain in these parts, and there isn&rsquo;t much to choose from.). When someone with an IQ of 140 marries someone from a racial subgroup/culture/religion where the average IQ is 93, the children tend to be seriously messed-up.</p>
<p>So, the kid has one parent whose ethnic subgroup produces quietly brilliant physicians and attorneys, and another parent whose subgroup produces loudly showy football standouts and beauty queens.  The kid has neither his mother&rsquo;s looks, nor his father&rsquo;s brains.  He&rsquo;s lost.  On one side is a culture of beautiful bullies who excel at making fun of smart people.  On the other side are smart people who aren&rsquo;t nearly as good as they think they are, at disguising their contempt for lesser peoples.</p>
<p>So, the Homecoming Queen/Medical Records Technician catches the Pediatrics Wizard.  Eventually, she has their seven-year-old son&rsquo;s portrait painted while he&rsquo;s wearing a lacy, ruffled, baby blue French Handsewn outfit (&#8220;That&rsquo;s how &#8216;they&rsquo; do, you know&hellip; In High Society&hellip;over thar in Daylissssss&hellip;&#8221;). She buys a big ol&rsquo; Yamaha Grand, and gets the kid music lessons. The Bully Boys on his Mama&rsquo;s side ridicule him.  His Father&rsquo;s side of the family speaks cryptically, but the gist is that he is inferior.  How could he not hate himself intensely?</p>
<p>The boy is bright enough to be verbally facile, but (especially after a life of being bullied) doesn&rsquo;t quite have the grades, or the IQ, for Medicine or Law.  So, he goes into something &#8216;creative&rsquo;.  Fashion school in Dallas?  JOURNALISM, maybe?</p>
<p>Yes!  Journalism!  How better to lash out at, and help destroy, the world that made him?  And for a dude who from one side got the ability to ridicule those better than him, and from the other side received the ability to cryptically convey contempt for inferiors&hellip; Well, it&rsquo;s just &#8216;the perfect storm&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying this has a thing to do with Tim Wise.  It&rsquo;s just a vibe I&rsquo;m getting from him that makes me have these thoughts.</p>
<p>Something else that just pops into my mind, after reading and seeing Tim Wise, is Andrew Sullivan (surely his Nemesis).  I&rsquo;m just wondering, I guess, about the physical contrast.  If Tim Wise had an 18.5&#8221; neck and cannonball biceps, like Sullivan does, would he be a bitter Marxist?  </p>
<p>I mean, if Wise were hot enough to catch the eye of a hunkster like Sullivan, would he feel the need to destroy the White Race?  I&rsquo;m not making assertions or assumptions about the erotic/sexual/romantic inclinations of either Man, you understand.  This is entirely hypothetical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just imagining the two meeting for a moment, during a Speed Dating event in Manhattan&hellip;Sullivan cringing and looking at the time on his cellphone&hellip;Wise wistful&hellip;how embittering that would be&hellip;</p>
<p>So wonderful that certain people can find an outlet for their bitterness, in cheering the imminent extermination of their own race.</p>

		<p>Bad enough what he wrote originally.   But he has now compounded that by lying, denying, waffling, and showing himself to be a sniveling, slippery, devious prevaricator who blames us for failing to understand the sophistication of his language, his clever subtleties and hyperboles. Stupid, dense hillbillies and rednecks that we all are!</p>
<p>Well, I live in Manhattan, not Dogpatch, and I read it exactly the same way that everyone else did.  It was as plain as 2+2=4. Why can&rsquo;t he at least stand up like a man and take responsibility for what he said, and apologize for his hate-filled drunken rant, instead of trying to blame it on our &#8220;miscomprehension&#8221;?  </p>

<p>I am sure I missed a few in both categories.  However, this would be my guess as to what Mr. Wise&rsquo;s mentality revolves around.  He is insulting and scorning our European American/European racial group and culture; in so doing, he is insulting the Founding Fathers of our country.     <br>

&#8220;I checked his Wikipedia biography, and it has already changed since yesterday. There is also a statement that he wrote that hate-filled essay while drunk. (How would they know? Are they covering for him?)&#8221;</p>
<p>If wise was indeed intoxicated when he wrote this White-hating gibberish, then the piece is even more damning. It has been my experience that people are far more honest and open with their true feelings when intoxicated, rather than sober. Alcohol seems to cause one to lose his inhbitions and speak from the heart. To my way of thinking, he would have been more convincing if he had apologized and blamed his writing on the fact that he was stone cold sober. <br>

<p><i>*NOTE: PLEASE RE-READ THE TITLE OF THIS ESSAY BEFORE GOING FURTHER. NOTICE, IT IS AIMED AT THE WHITE RIGHT. NOT ALL WHITE PEOPLE.

<p>The original piece was not aimed at ALL whites, just SOME whites; the kind of whites Mr. Wise and those of his ilk detest. That&rsquo;s the distinction he believes allows him to speak his mind.</p>

		<p>Thanks to Mindweapon for some very interesting insights. I too was pleased, and surprised, to find your article printed here - although the complete original was even better.  Particularly thought-provoking were the analogies to Psychololocigal Operations, Mindwar, and the connection of Tim Wise&rsquo; thinking to our anti-intellectual Mass Media culture. We have grown up in that culture and take it so much for granted that we don&rsquo;t even notice it. To us, it seems normal. </p>
<p>Wise is obviouly a complex, twisted, devious, and hate-motivated individual. He has just proven that. A tormented soul with an uncertain sense of self-identity - and he doesn&rsquo;t want anyone else to have a clear identity either. Very typical. The &#8220;mulatto mentality&#8221;, one could call it.  I commend you for being unafraid to broach certain proscribed subjects in the name of getting at the Truth. That is the only way we shall ever understand what is really going on with those bitter,  alienated haters such as Tim Wise.</p>

___________________</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the hatred goes much deeper than that,  although I wouldn&rsquo;t rule out the &#8220;opportunist&#8221; part.  The anti-racist spirit of our times may have opened up the opportunity for him to make this his &#8220;schtick&#8221; and cash in on it.   As Gypsy RoseLee&rsquo;s mother sang, <i>&#8220;Ya gotta have a gimmick&#8221;.</i>.. and so Mr. Wise found his gimmick. </p>
<p>Lecturing others on their inborn white racist guilt sure beats working for a living.  (Has he ever had a job?  There&rsquo;s no indication of it. I mean a real, productive, useful JOB that involves WORK.)</p>
<p>But no, this isn&rsquo;t &#8220;self-hatred&#8221;. Only a white person can be a self-hating white.  And  in America, a person who isn&rsquo;t fully white isn&rsquo;t considered white. THAT&rsquo;s the demon that&rsquo;s driving him!</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how how he looks to us, or who/what  he SEEMS to be. The only thing that matters, in his mind,  is what HE considers himself to be.  Now, he has hastily backtracked and claims to be white and  that  his wife and mother are  white (I notice his interesting omission of his father),  but in his past he has explicitly declared himself otherwise. That&rsquo;s on the record.</p>
<p>Even if he didn&rsquo;t say anything about himself, his seething hatred for whites speaks plainly enough for itself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have difficulty understanding how Tim Wise can make a career of this. Are there still that many guilt stricken white liberals willing to pay for his commentary?&#8221;</p>
<p>If he actually had to sell this stuff himself he would probably starve.  He could hold his seminars in a mini-van.  But he is plugged into the institutional white-hating racism of our universities, he&rsquo;s doing quite well, and he&rsquo;ll probably do quite well in the future.  After all,  this is the same sector that gave Angela Davis (terrorist and racist murderer) and Bill Ayers (terrorist) life-time employment,  not because it thought they were innocent or reformed, but precisely because they are not.  And as usual, Conservatives and Republicans have nothing to say about the whole mess. </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s very much produced-in-his-own-bedroom-youtube-post quality commentary (although &#8220;quality&#8221; may be a poor choice of words.)</p>
<p>I think a few of the universities that he so &#8220;bravely&#8221; speaks at decided that he went over the top with this last tirade, so he&rsquo;s backed off his extremist PC white self hatred routine. (To the extent that it&rsquo;s &#8220;self&#8221; hatred, that is. Remember, he&rsquo;s half Jewish.)</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s say it all works out like Timmy would like it to:<br>
Okay,who is going to run the place once whites are diminished or gone? Look at the graduation rates of Hispanics and Blacks and a sinking feeling develops. They are order takers for the most part. Leaders, never.<br>
The Asians are the enemies of blacks and probably browns also. However if whites were displaced they would run the show. The unreality of the anti-white party clearly shows through as they have made no moves toward joining forces with Asians, and would probably be rebuffed if they did. Asians don&rsquo;t need them; they have a semi-allegiance to their ascendant Eastern motherland and could care a fig about blacks&rsquo; African groove or the mariachi set.</p>

<p><br>
Thanks for that piece of sound logic, George.  That is a good point. In other words, it all boils down to the same thing: white extinction. That&rsquo;s been the  ultimate goal of the Extreme Left for a long time, as their spokesperson, the late Susan Sontag made explicitly clear in her statement that &#8220;the white race is the cancer of history&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Sontag didn&rsquo;t consider herself any more &#8220;white&#8221; than Wise does, despite any superficial appearances.</p>
<p>If Tim has his way, we&rsquo;ll ALL be history, alongside the dinosaurs and dodos and passenger pigeons. We&rsquo;ll be museum exhibits, nothing more.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be some Lefties, but they&rsquo;ll be hastily miscegenating and repudiating their evil white ancestry, to show their love for brown and black, and to accommodate to the new situation.</p>
<p>Wise rants against a return to the terrible 50s and 60s, his nightmare world.  What would he know about it?  He wasn&rsquo;t even there!  But I was. It was a lot more peaceful and civilized  than what we have now.  We really had a higher standard of living, overall.   And no, blacks were not being strung up from every tree, contrary to his hysterical propaganda. And blacks could get good jobs (and did) if they met the qualifications,  just like anybody. </p>
<p>How inconvenient for him to have somebody like me saying this! No wonder Mr. Wise wants us oldies  (that is, people with long memories) to die off as quickly as possible. Then his version of history can reign uncontested.</p>
<p>I had a white-hating, Marxist, professor of anthropology, a Zulu from South Africa,   who made the statement in class (back about 1970, forty years ago)  that the world will be a better place when it is at last all coffee-colored. Beginning at least with the notorious Frankfurt School, that has been their goal and their dream all along, though not alway so openly stated to the general public.  They assure us that this will bring peace, love, and justice to the world.  How naive!   How much peace, love and justice can be found in Africa right now, where blacks are constantly slaughtering one another all over the continent? Independence and black rule have brought them only chaos, whereas white rule  had brought them progress and peace   &mdash;   for the first time in their history. </p>
<p>That professor&rsquo;s silly statement was made long before the Hutu-Tutsi genocide in Ruanda (and many others).  Wars are not caused by color. Germany did not fight Russia because they hated each other&rsquo;s color! The British and French did not fight for centuries over color.  The Japanese did not invade  China and occupy Korea because they hated their color. The Catholics and Protestants in Ireland are undifferentiated by color.  Making everyone a uniform brown is a false remedy that will accomplish nothing whatsoever, except to get rid of whites, leaving a maelstrom of brown chaos. It will turn back the clock of history and of evolution.</p>
<p>What benefit will be accomplised by eliminating whites?   &mdash;  - the very people (and the ONLY people)  who abolished slavery, established democratic  procedure, rule by law, representative government, the scientific method, the industrial revolution, plant genetics, the germ theory &hellip; not to mention inventing    automobiles, computers, telephones, railways, radios, air travel, vaccination&hellip; and on and on for pages.</p>
<p>These are the people Mr. Wise wants to eliminate for his Better World?  It is a formula for a return to savagery.  That evil, self-serving  pied-piper would set us back fifty thousand  years.  At least.  May heaven spare us from the likes of Tim Wise!  <br>

		<p>Do people who are mixed race have within themselves a DNA brain conflict?  Just as when you plant one flower type next to a different flower type they often compete with each other beneath the soil, maybe people of mixed racial heritage have within their brains contrary neural pathways that compete, causing them to frequently feel depressed and angry.</p>
<p>I posit that White personality traits are frequently more gentle or refined than many other races&rsquo; traits, and in the mixed race person&rsquo;s brain the White &#8220;gentle personality&#8221; nerve pathways are beaten back so the non-White &#8220;aggressive personality&#8221; pathways can dominate.  The conflicting neurons aiming for dominance within the same mind causes great emotional conflict to the mixed race person.  </p>
<p>Because these mixed race people are so unhappy, they seek fulfilment by changing society&rsquo;s social structure and by directly or indirectly punishing the objects of their jealousy.</p>

Back then it was still possible to believe that blacks and whites were genetically equivalent, and that blacks would soon prove their ability to create civilized communities in the United States, and well functioning countries in Africa.  <br>
 <br>
Forty years later, those who draw attention to what has really happened often face sanctions of various sorts.  Even most conservatives prefer to avoid a candid discussion of the matter.  White blue collar workers have learned that it may be dangerous to explain why they had to leave the neighborhoods where their grandparents were born.  <br>

<p>Timothy Wise&rsquo;s honesty is actually a good thing. It clearly shows the intent of non-whites to take over the country and dance on the graves of white people. This will help the dwindling white majority wake up to the fact that their posterity will be persecuted in a majority-minority America, the country they founded and made great. It&rsquo;s time they do something to stop Big Immigration and demand an end to birthright citizenship while they still have some shred of political influence.</p>

<p>WVNews.com is simply asking sane Whites to write to Sewanee, and do a &#8216;leftist intimidation thing&rsquo; as it OUR right (&#8220;Oh, wait, those are OUR planes now&#8221;- Bill Clinton, at his first inauguration) for his scurrilous and H8 filled comments, to STOP him from even being HIRED to speak there. Whether Sewanee agrees with him or not, is not the issue. It&rsquo;s merely &#8216;payback is as payback does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The masks are off, and when a resident of the Oval Office can call White Americans, the &#8216;Enemy,&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t need to be civil to such dregs any longer.</p>
<p>So, realizing his party/ideology just LOST, and now realizing that WE can &#8216;play the same game&rsquo; (and Wise, seeing dollars flying out the window&hellip;) made the &#8216;executive decision&rsquo; to &#8216;recant.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>All of Wise&rsquo;s posturing aside, his basic premise is wrong to begin with.  Whites will not be helpless against the brown tide, but are free to carve out their own new nation from what is now America, and invite &#8220;browns&#8221; to do the same.  One will prosper, the other will collapse and pound on the walls of the other, blaming it for leaving them to their own devices.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve already commented on this article, but something else occurred to me as I&rsquo;ve been following this story over the past few days.</p>
<p>One thing we see over and over again in this age of politically correct hypersensitivity to every perceived slight is this notion that an &#8220;offended group&#8221; gets precedence in every case, gets the right above all others to determine whether or not they&rsquo;re offended, and if enough of them whine loudly enough they get the right to demand redress.</p>
<p>We see it all the time. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether anyone intended to offend anyone else, because as the PC thought police tell us, intentions don&rsquo;t matter - only the effects. Which is why Michael Richards, for example, will carry the brand of being a racist around with him for the rest of his life when he clearly isn&rsquo;t, simply because he used the &#8220;N-word&#8221; and offended blacks with the &#8220;effects&#8221; of using that word. Just using the word unintentionally makes one a racist, and can even end your career.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of similar cases lately. Dr. Laura. Rick Sanchez. Juan Williams. All cases where someone crosses some imaginary line and offends a protected group, without even realizing it and intending to be hurtful or offensive. </p>
<p>In this country, offending people might not be illegal, but it can certainly cost you your job.</p>
<p>But then it really depends on who you&rsquo;re offending doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Say you want to build a mosque a few blocks away from Ground Zero. Then, many families of the victims of 9-11 speak up and say the idea is offensive to them, that it hurts them, and millions of people around the country - in fact a majority of people - speak up and agree that yeah, it is an offensive idea. But is this offended group listened to? Oddly enough, no. They&rsquo;re branded as intolerant racists.</p>
<p>And then, on a smaller scale, a great many people read Wise&rsquo;s hate screed and express repulsion and are indeed offended. If you&rsquo;re white and conservative and over a certain age, then who wouldn&rsquo;t be offended by Wise&rsquo;s rant? His piece essentially takes a moment of  transfer of political power - a time honored ritual in this country that ought to bring us together as Americans more than divide us - and uses it to gloat over your mortality (a creepy, childish thing to do in any situation).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an offensive piece of writing by any standard, and especially coming from someone who claims to be interested in moving this country forward on race issues. If an analogous diatribe were to come from someone on the other side of the aisle - say, gloating over the possible demographic death of some favored minority group - this could easily be a career ending incident.</p>
<p>But apparently some people are allowed to be offensive and others aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s okay to offend some groups of people, but not others.</p>
<p>Personally, I despise the PC &#8220;whose offended most&#8221; game. It&rsquo;s humorless, tedious and frankly, it&rsquo;s a game that reeks of weakness. Who wants to play the role of sniveling crybabies? But as long we&rsquo;re stuck playing it, we shouldn&rsquo;t accept this uneven playing field. They&rsquo;re clearly not interested in playing fair - they&rsquo;ll take whatever we allow them to get, and laugh in our faces while they&rsquo;re doing it. </p>
<p>Tim Wise&rsquo;s rant is offensive and it should cost him work.</p>

<p>EAU: Stop Tim Wise From Speaking at Sewanee, TN <br>
Posted on: 2010-11-07 13:05:45 </p>
<p><br>

spurple@sewanee.edu,local@tennessean.com,newsroom@newschannel5.com</p>
<p>To whom it may concern;</p>
<p>It is our understanding on the 9th of November, Sewanee will host Mr. Tim Wise to speak to your students regarding &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please be advised that Mr. Wise is well known for his blatant bigotry against persons of European extraction. In spite of his credentials, denials (and ethnicity) Mr. Wise is not an &#8216;anti racist.&rsquo; Mr. Wise is an anti-white activist, but he disguises it in order to further what amounts to a Marxist based degeneration of European Americans in favor of a multicultural socialist Utopia; an activity we understand that also happens to pay quite well.</p>
<p>His caustic and mean spirited diatribes are well known and normally follow course with a screed he penned (here) regarding the recent Republican election victory and white American voters:</p>
<p>&#8220;We just have to be patient.</p>
<p>And wait for your hearts to stop beating.</p>
<p>And stop they will.</p>
<p>And for some of you, real damned soon truth be told.&#8221; </p>
<p>While Mr. Wise has since claimed that he is only referring to what he calls the &#8220;white right&#8221;, the fact of the matter is he is likely including all of our mothers, fathers, sons and daughters in his hateful declarations whose view points diverge from his own. Moreover, following Mr. Wise&rsquo;s sick logic it should also be acceptable to wish the hearts of those on the &#8220;non-white left&#8221; to stop beating as well.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the integrity of the University of the South&rsquo;s student body and your reputation, we strongly and publicly recommend that you cancel Mr. Wise&rsquo;s appearance. </p>
<p>sincerely;</p>
<p>Mr. Drago Rendl<br>
Mr Frank Roman<br>
Mr John Young<br>
Board of Directors, European Americans United</p>

<p>It looks like Tim Wise will feel right at home at Sewanee. Lots of extremist and dangerous anti-White hatred on that campus, which may be typical for any majority White campus these days.</p>
<p>  When Whites gather in overwhelming and secure numbers, the weakness for elevating the afrovoodoo black to the status of idols seems to break out like a virulent and disfiguring disease. </p>
<p>Only when White Humanity is surrounded by real blacks do we find the courage to cure ourselves from the Diversity Curse.</p>

		<p>What he&rsquo;s really terrified of is that we&rsquo;ll REALLY wake up.   He and his anti-white cohorts all sing from the same songbook, all telling us our dispossession in our own homeland here is inevitable, that our becoming a minority is unstoppable like the tides.</p>
<p>Wrong.   It&rsquo;s just a public policy that be halted and reversed as soon as the Congress passes and the President signs the necessary laws.</p>
<p>Expelling the illegal aliens will buy us decades.  Any positive steps on legal immigration will buy us even more time - a simple moratorium, a radically reduced total cap, an income and education test, an IQ test, an English language test, an American culture test, a simple racial test, etc.  Ending birthright citizenship via simple statute, as permitted by the 14th Amendment with no further amendment necessary, will also do wonders.</p>
<p>All these things, short of an outright racial test, would be supported by large majorities of the American people.   And thus all we have to do is elect leaders who will carry out our wishes.   And even an outright racial test can perhaps be &#8220;sold&#8221; if we frame it as making our immigrant pool &#8220;look like America&#8221; and/or have our immigration policy not &#8220;upset our ethnic balance&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t read all the comments but we all know Timmy&rsquo;s lame attempt at explaining his rambling anti white diatribe was a lie.</p>

I went to that original site, Fair &amp; Delightsome, and while I enjoyed the article itself, I found the comments section to be populated by spaced-out crazies; cultists who are living in an imaginary world of their own, a fantasy world. Truly disturbing! They are even further detatched from reality than Tim Wise is. And THAT&rsquo;S saying a lot! </em></p>
<p>As someone here always says, &ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; Indeed.</p>
<p>Hi, Browser.  I was probably the most active commenter on that thread.  I&rsquo;m always willing to learn from my betters, so perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me exactly what I said that was so &#8220;detached from reality&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of the commenters commented from a religious perspective. They are Mormons. Not your religion, but their own sincerely held beliefs. So, when you say &#8220;God help us&#8221;, exactly which God are you invoking, and what makes Him superior to their God? Oh, yours is rooted in reality, and theirs is not? Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t share your views must be demented? Sounds a lot like Tim Wise.</p>
<p>By their fruits ye shall know them. You don&rsquo;t even have to be religious to see the wisdom of that maxim. So, I invite you to travel to Provo, Utah, and see their fruits. See how their communities stack up against yours. But don&rsquo;t plan to stay - they like their communities just as they are.</p>

		<p>Mr Wise&rsquo;s original rant proves that when you think &#8220;they want us dead&#8221;, that you&rsquo;re not actually being paranoid.</p>
<p>&#8216;Do unto others as you&rsquo;d have others do on to you&rsquo;?</p>
<p>His vision for the future isn&rsquo;t far off, for when all men and women were deemed &#8216;equal&rsquo;, it has always been inevitable that one day the breeders would rule.<br>
Normally the left denies this reality, when we Right wingers use it in an argument for wanting to defend our culture, but now Mr Wise is using this fact as an opportunity to do a sour grapes gloat after the Mid Terms didn&rsquo;t go his way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve won this round RW&rsquo;ers, but we&rsquo;re out breeding you, we&rsquo;ve stolen the minds of your children and all we need to do is to wait for the last generation of the un indoctrinated to pass, then we&rsquo;ll have finally won&#8221;!!</p>
<p>His hatred sure is sobering.<br>
We Whites need to retreat together to specific strategic locations to concentrate our numbers and to rebuild a world where the Tim Wises aren&rsquo;t forced to live amongst us any longer. <br>
Leaderless cells that form together, bound by an unspoken agenda to protect a future, for our children as the heirs of our civilization.</p>
<p>In at least some small part, I would wager that this is probably what most of us on this forum are working towards already.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I had a white-hating, Marxist, professor of anthropology, a Zulu from South Africa, who made the statement in class (back about 1970, forty years ago) that the world will be a better place when it is at last all coffee-colored.&#8221; Old Timer</p>
<p>  Yes indeed, this is the great liberal dream of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. If Mr. Wise was carefully questioned about miscegenation, I believe that he would endorse this common liberal viewpoint. He already boasts that American whites will soon be an ineffectual minority in several decades. His views were recently given very respectful coverage on CNN. In a way I&rsquo;m grateful to Tim Wise for being so forthright about his anti-white/majority views  &mdash;  more diversity liberals should be so honest.  </p>

<p>It is such a naive, silly viewpoint. It&rsquo;s childish.  Blacks and browns go about slaughtering each other in Africa with glee, with no concern as to their color.  Nor any compassion for other blacks.  American Indians did the same here, often allying with the whiteman against each other.  They hated other Indians more than they did the whites.</p>
<p>In fact, I can&rsquo;t think of a single war in human history that was ever fought over color.  </p>
<p>To imagine that eliminating whiteness (or color distinctions) from the world would bring about world peace is the fantasy dream of Flower Chidren.  But look at those Flower Chidren now: a bunch of burnt-out potheads, those that are still alive that is.  So much for their good sense!</p>

		<p>So CNN (AKA the &#8220;no white men allowed&#8221; channel) had Time Wise on *after this hate-filled, racist rant* and gave him the soft-glove, laudatory treatment? As much as I&rsquo;m aware of CNN&rsquo;s relentless pursuit of racial grievance politics, they have managed to surprise me yet. What a despicable &#8220;news&#8221; network. I think it goes without saying that no self-respecting white person should ever watch CNN, if it wasn&rsquo;t already abundantly clear before this incident.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect anyone in Atlanta to worry much that Tim Wise will be in town tomorrow to spew his toxic and virulent anti White hate speech, paid for by Georgia&rsquo;s White Taxpayers.   Atlanta&rsquo;s White Humanity is so cowering and embracing of Diversity, that they probably would worry if Tim Wise wasn&rsquo;t coming.</p>
<p>Atlanta Whites put Obama stickers on their cars, not as a cynical deception, but because they really do consider being ruled nationally by KenyaObamaVoodoo as &#8220;historic social progress,&#8221; and it helps them psychologically compensate themselves for willingly living in a city ruled by corrupt, indolent, and vindictive blacks.  Atlanta&rsquo;s Whites are miserable, and they even consider that as Progress, or Equality, or Restorative Justice, &#8220;Vibrant, Safe, Diverse,&#8221; or the right thing to do, our pressing on with our unfinished business, or increasing the intensity, etc.</p>
<p>Never trust an Atlanta Whitey to be a Race Realist.  They wouldn&rsquo;t live in Atlanta if they were.  Former Atlanta residents are Race Realists.</p>

		<p>Time Wise compliments Sewanee students for not asking &#8220;challenging questions.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Sewanee costs $46,000 per year.  For that, White parents can be assured that their White children are learning to: 1. Never ask a challenging question when confronting a University sponsored anti White hate monger on campus, with a question such as &#8220;What faith do you have in blacks that if we rid society of White privilege and inequality by lowering ourselves down to their level that they will not keep pulling us down even further?&#8221;,  and 2. Never even think to challenge anti White hate, because it is now acceptable, normal, and mainstream attitude on campus colleges and in any corporation or institution that hosts Diversity speakers and hires Officers of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it turns out, about 400 people came to my talk at Sewanee (also known as the University of the South)  &mdash;  an incredibly conservative campus  &mdash;  and none caused trouble or even asked a challenging question. </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>If I were a speaker, I would be dismayed, disappointed, embarrassed that none of my audience <i>&#8220;even asked a challenging question&#8221;. </i>Is that a reflexion on the dull quality of my audience, or on the uninteresting quality of my speech?</p>
<p>As for Sewanee being &#8220;an incredibly conservative campus&#8221;, I find that a strain to believe, considering that is a liberal arts college owned by the Episcopal Church. Not exactly a nest of Amreners, I gather.</p>
<p>Oh, and questioning Mr. Wise is considered equivalent to &#8220;causing trouble&#8221;?  Really?  I would say he had left himself  open to it. Failure to take up the challenge does not speak well of the student audience.</p>

<p>Tim Wise compliments Sewanee students for not asking &ldquo;challenging questions&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sewanee costs White parents $46,000 per year. (The Diversity all get free ride scholarships in effort to increase Sewanee&rsquo;s much needed Diversity.)</p>
<p>For that $46,000 x four years, White parents can be assured that their White children are learning to: </p>
<p>1. Never ask a challenging question when encountering a University sponsored anti White hatemonger on campus with a question such as, &ldquo;What faith do you have in the blacks such that if we rid society of White privilege and social inequality by lowering ourselves down to their level that they will not keep pulling us down even further?&rdquo; </p>
<p>2. Never even think to challenge anti White hatred, because it is now the normal, accepted, and expected mainstream attitude on college campuses and in any corporation or institution that hosts Diversity speakers and hires Officers of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it turns out, about 400 people came to my talk at Sewanee (also known as the University of the South)  &mdash;  an incredibly conservative campus  &mdash;  and none caused trouble or even asked a challenging question. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.timwise.org/2010/11/talking-loud-and-saying-nothing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.timwise.org/2010/11/talking-loud-and-saying-nothing/</a></p>
<p>In that case, Sewanee should no longer be allowed the proud reputation as &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo; It now should be called &rdquo; extremely liberal and dangerously radical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe the $46,000 is money well spent. White college students will graduate from Sewanee knowing how to keep their mouths shut and will therefore not be targeted for career oppression and marginalization by the Diversity Enforcers and the new, rising Multicultural Elite who embrace their own unearned Diversity Privilege while punishing high achieving and meritorious Whites. </p>
<p>Students who speak up and ask the &ldquo;challenging questions&rdquo; will be targeted as &ldquo;potentially dangerous extremists who need watching, and certainly are still holding onto unacknowledged and outdated biases, and possibly are real racists who retain a shameful nostalgia for the &lsquo;innocence and purity&rsquo; of Jim Crow segregation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadly, Sewanee somehow is still known as conservative.  Folks around here say that the fundraising office keeps that lie going so that conservative alumni will keep giving money.  Meanwhile, behind the Sewanee Gates, the worst kind of liberalism possible is running rampant and destroying our Southern youth.</p>
<p>They actually paid Tim Wise, didn&rsquo;t harass him, and gave him a standing ovation.   What more do you want to know about Sewanee?</p>

SHERWOOD, TN, 97.2% WHITES ONLY! That must bring great shame upon the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee, which has a parish down there.</p>
<p>The unfortunate aspect of so much ready info. being available on the Internet is that the Government&rsquo;s Housing and Urban Development Czar can target Sherwood for &#8220;remedial housing initiatives&#8221; that bring Section 8 public housing minorities into a peaceful and wonderfully White community.  Sherwood is overwhelmingly White, which makes it a certain target. </p>
<p>Sewanee was once overwhelmingly and wonderfully White, and it got targeted by the Episcopal Church for disgraceful racial integration, which now gives pernicious anti White hate monger Time Wise a standing ovation in Convocation Hall.</p>
<p>Sherwoodian, enjoy it while it lasts.  We have a dangerous oversupply of the blacks up here in Sewanee.  I assume many of them are soon headed your way.<br>

		<p>Anonymous #43: <i>The Wikipedia article on Wise has been edited to say that he is a Bolshevik white-hating racist. This is not libelous, since his own writing makes the description abundantly clear.</i></p>
<p>You will not be surprised to find out that the Wikipedia article on Tim Wise has been edited again so that all references to his anti-white rant have been removed.  Wikipedia is maintained by the politically correct, and they want to keep Wikipedia that way.</p>

Sewanee once was &#8220;incredibly conservative,&#8221; as it was supposed to be from the beginning onward. But the feminist, race mixing liberals in the Episcopal Church have ruined it. Now, it is &#8220;incredibly, horrifically, and dangerously liberal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Time Wise called it &#8220;incredibly conservative&#8221; to show that he is helping to break down its outdated attitudes, that he is a pioneer, he is a trailblazer, he is a civil rights icon, he attacks discrimination and the evil White privilege, and he&rsquo;s so good at it, even &#8220;incredibly conservative&#8221; Sewanee can&rsquo;t resist his power.  Sewanee is just begging him to please come and make us  &#8220;less incredibly conservative, less biased, less prejudiced, less racist, more progressive, more accepting, more tolerant, more inclusive, marching forward as we fight against injustice where ever we find it&hellip; and Haiti is our fault&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewanee of the past would never have allowed him on the Mountain. Sewanee of Diversity will probably have him back soon for the Sewanee Hates Whitey Show, Part II.  Students who don&rsquo;t attend the next will have their on-line activities monitored for unacknowledged biases and latent racism.<br>

Vile anti white hatemonger Tim Wise spoke at Sewanee Episcopal University in Sewanee, Tennessee, and received a standing ovation from 400 in attendance, none of whom could muster the courage to ask him a &#8220;challenging question,&#8221; or even think of one.</p>
<p>Sewanee Episcopal is a member of the Association of Episcopal Colleges (AEC), the U.S. chapter of the Colleges and Universities of the Anglican Communion (CUAC). </p>
<p>AEC/CUAC just elected their new president, an African faced, light skinned mulatto, of course.  No full blooded Africans qualified.  </p>
<p>To get the best jobs, Africans must steal enough of our White genes from the womb of a degraded race traitor White women in order to speak articulately enough to fool the &#8220;compassionate, justice seeking&#8221; Whites, who are all cursed with IQ&rsquo;s high enough to squelch their inner survival Race Instinct. </p>
<p>And he told them just what he will do to them, just the way they wanted it. Tim Wise couldn&rsquo;t have said it any better:</p>
<p>http://www.episcopalchurch.org/81831_125761_ENG_HTM.htm</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important for AEC to be committed to the vision of the churches,&#8221; said Sellers in the release. &#8220;We will continually strive to alleviate poverty and injustice and work toward racial reconciliation and restorative justice.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE:  WHITEY, PAY MORE. NO MORE JOBS FOR WHITEY. WE HIRE ONLY BLACKS, GAYS, MUSLIMS, AND THE UGLIEST WOMEN WE CAN FIND OF ANY COLOR.  THE ONLY WHITEYS WE WILL HIRE ARE THE UGLIEST OF YOUR WOMEN. NO MORE WHITE MALES SHOULD BE HIRED AT SEWANEE UNTIL EVERY BLACK, GAY, MUSLIM, AND FEMINIST WHO WANTS A JOB HERE HAS ONE.</p>
<p>WE WILL RESTORE WHAT WHITE MEN STOLE FROM US.  EVERY WHITE MAN AT SEWANEE WHO STILL HAS A JOB ONLY HAS THAT JOB BECAUSE HE STOLE IT FROM US. PAY BACK TIME, WHITEY. YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. COMPLIMENTS OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH.<br>

______________</p>
<p>I thought religion  was, or used to be, about man&rsquo;s relationship to God, about worship    &mdash;   not &#8220;alleviating poverty and injustice and working toward racial reconciliation and <i>restorative  </i>justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since when did churches become social work agencies?</p>
<p>This type &#8220;Christianity&#8221; has become purely secular, pure social gospel, Marxism marquerading in clerical garb! That&rsquo;s why I gave up religion and became an atheist (along with other reasons).</p>
<p>Oh, and DO take note of that key word, <i>&#8220;RESTORATIVE&#8221; </i>justice which is so cunningly buried in there.  That reveals his hidden agenda. Such an innocuous-sounding term!  In other words, get out your wallets and checkbooks, Whitey!  There are going to be some demands to be paid. Your people&rsquo;s past sins will not be forgiven without coughing up some restitution. That means M-O-N-E-Y!!!</p>
<p>How much?   Until the well goes dry.</p>
