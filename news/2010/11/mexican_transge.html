<h1><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16560073">Mexican Transgender Asylum Seeker Allowed to Stay in U.S.</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Felisa Cardona, Denver Post, November 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reyes [Alexandra Reyes], 32, was born a boy named Carlos but began living life as a girl at age 8, infuriating her traditional Mayan family in Cenotillo, Mexico. One night, an aunt walked into Reyes&rsquo; bedroom and tried to kill her with a machete because she didn&rsquo;t want Reyes in the family.</p>
<p>The Mexican police wouldn&rsquo;t arrest Reyes&rsquo; abusers. So 10 years ago, she paid a smuggler to get her across the border. She walked four days and four nights through the desert into the U.S. and made it to Colorado, where a friend told her she would be safe.</p>
<p>Now, she gets to stay here.</p>
<p>Last week, an immigration judge granted Reyes a form of asylum that allows her to stay in the U.S. based on the persecution she suffered as a transgender woman in Mexico.</p>
<p>The Board of Immigration Appeals withheld her removal from the U.S. after determining the Mexican government would not protect her from abuse if she was deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be physically dangerous for her to walk down the street,&#8221; said her attorney, Bryon Large. &#8220;She could be sexually assaulted.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a condition of her asylum, Reyes must obey the law and can&rsquo;t leave the U.S. for any reason if she hopes to be allowed back in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reyes found herself in trouble last year after she bilked a cab driver out of a $500 fare. The cabbie drove her from Aurora to Breckenridge and back, but a friend she was meeting declined to pay the fare as promised.</p>
<p>Reyes went to the cab company a week later to pay the bill, and the company called the police, who then called Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reyes paid restitution in the cab driver case. In the meantime, she was moved to an immigration detention facility in Aurora for deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>Biologically male, Reyes spent 11 months in custody housed with men, but she says she was treated well and didn&rsquo;t have any problems despite a lack of privacy.</p>
<p>She takes female hormones but has not yet had sexual reassignment surgery. She finds the American people accepting of her differences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reyes is trying to learn English and deciding what kind of work she wants to do.</p>

		<p>Granting asylum to someone because of &#8220;her&#8221; mental problems is a joke.</p>
<p>I like cats a lot. In fact, I oftentimes feel like a cat on the inside. Perhaps I should get some cosmetic surgery on my face and a full facial tattoo so I can look the way that I feel on the inside, similar to this cat man: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/5wlabf" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/5wlabf</a></p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>We are the way that nature made us. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if we have some sort of psychological problem where we feel otherwise. No amount of facial feminization surgery and estrogen injections will change the fact that we are born a certain way.</p>

		<p>Look,  I am &#8220;gay&#8221; and I have trouble believing this story.<br>
She came here 10 years ago, and NOW she&rsquo;s trying to learn English and is deciding what kind of work she wants to do?  How has she been supporting herself all this time? And a $500 dollar cab fare??? [for someone who doesn&rsquo;t work?]   C&rsquo;mon!   Anyway, if she went to the cab company to pay the bill, why did they have her arrested?  Something&rsquo;s very strange here! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that this person has had a wretched, chaotic, messed-up background, not of her own choosing perhaps, but it&rsquo;s doubtful that&rsquo;s going to change very much. </p>

		<p>He will never pass as a she.</p>
<p>That being said I feel sorry for people who go to all sorts of kaniptions to change their sex, which you really can not.  But I believe he should fight for &#8216;trans&rsquo; rights in Mexco.  We have an obligation to treat our own with dignity even if we don&rsquo;t understand it but we don&rsquo;t need to bring them here.</p>

		<p>I am a regular reader of Amren, and also a transgender Germanic. I don&rsquo;t feel that the issues in this story are all contingent upon each other. Seeking asylum for that issue is a better reason than most, but considering the abuses of immigration into the US, I would assume she could live in a richer tourist-y area of Mexico, with less crime, perhaps at the cost of a lower standard of living. But that is an issue with the country itself, it is not the fault of US citizens.</p>
<p>@poster #1 (and a couple of other posters):</p>
<p>I advise you to actually look into the very important effects of hormones in the womb. Scientific literature (that would be neuroscience, etc., not &#8216;social science&rsquo; opinions) supports the natural origin of transgenderism, just as science supports the notion of a natural origin of homosexuality.</p>
<p>I understand that many of the readers here have traditionalist views, but you must recall that the original spirit of progressivism (pre WWI) was a distinctly European trend, and that some good things have occurred recently concerning evolution in attitudes (gay and trans rights is what I&rsquo;m pointing at).</p>

		<p>So, basically, another immigrant wants to be here instead of there. In this case because because of political/social persecution. Then all the smart people rail against our feeling superior&hellip; It&rsquo;s just Too much superiority to have these Latino study groups and activist groups at our nations universities railing against this aspect of our culture. Yes, that&rsquo;s going Too far, we need to get rid of these elite groups. We don&rsquo;t want to rub it in. </p>

		<p>Right on, Jeddermann. As much as I dislike mass immigration from south of the border and what it&rsquo;s doing to my wages in the building trades, I&rsquo;m happy to make exceptions in cases like this. I may not understand what causes a person to feel they&rsquo;ve been assigned the wrong gender, but it&rsquo;s as real as can be to them and all the moralizing and harrumphing in the world won&rsquo;t change the way they feel about themselves. Considering that Mestizo men are among the most viciously homophobic people on Earth, I think giving refuge to people like this is the moral high ground. Now, as for the &#8220;economic refugees&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>So Mexican homosexual can get asylum in the U.S. because people are nasty to HIM, and he has to tighten up when he is around homophobic Mexicans. White men is South Africa face far far worse from Whitephobic blacks, and they are refused asylum.</p>

<p>So what you are saying is that we should allow all the gays/transgenders come to America?  Just because they are subject to persecution in their own lands?  how many millions more would be coming here if that is the case? Are we the world&rsquo;s savior? </p>
<p>We have become the world&rsquo;s dumping ground for all the basket cases and misfits.We have had enough of them pouring in here for the last 50 years! How can ANY nation survive this onslaught of misery without becoming a miserable nation. Look around! </p>
<p>Asylum needs to be STOPPED, not encouraged!  There are tens of thousands of gays, etc in Mexico and all over the world and they are  using this persecution nonsense as a way to come here and most of us know it. There are billions of people in the world who are being persecuted far worse than gays/transgenders, so I guess we should just open ourselves up to even more dysfunctional people?  We had better wake up to the agenda being perpetrated against us or else we will all go down together.</p>

You do know that &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; is another excuse to bring in millions more asylum seekers, along with being gay, don&rsquo;t you? They have turned America into a dysfunctional dumping ground for all the world&rsquo;s misfits/poor and this has been going on since 1965. How long will we have to suffer and our nation destroyed &#8220;because of our compassion&#8221; for the world&rsquo;s refuse?  </p>

<p>Indeed.  Since 1945 actually.  This mania, this obsession with &#8220;asylum&#8221; and &#8220;refugees&#8221; has its roots in WW2 and the famous ship, the St. Louis [if you don&rsquo;t know, look it up]. They have resolved that nothing of the sort will ever be able to happen again. Using that convenient excuse, they have played upon the &#8220;guilt&#8221; of America to throw the whole country wide  open to the world&rsquo;s &#8220;teeming masses yearning to breathe free&#8221;, the &#8220;huddled refuse of every &#8220;teeming shore&#8221;  (as a propagandist wrote on the base of Miss Liberty).</p>
<p>The only solution is to get VERY strict with a sharply limited definition of &#8220;refugee&#8221;, or to abolish the whole asylum program entirely. It has gotten completely out of control and has become an excuse for invading us. In fact, this has with all white countries around the world   &mdash;   even countries such as Sweden and Switzerland which were neutral in WW2 and which did take in many refugees (but never enough! &hellip; and that accusation is always flung at them to feed their guilt).</p>
<p>Sorry, it seems cruel, but the  life is cruel and the world is full of cruelties.  We cannot be responsible for the problems of all humanity.  Nor should we become a dumping ground for the world&rsquo;s unwanted.  Let each country be responsible for its own.  Their problems are not ours. Realistically, they cannot be, or we will be overwhelmed with their endless problems and their chaos.</p>
<p>This realistic concept of our limitations was expressed in the wise words of Pres. Adams: <br>
<i>&#8220;While we are the friends of liberty everywhere, we are the guardians only of our own.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>He was referring to defending democracy, but in today&rsquo;s expanded  context (which he could never have imagined!) it could apply as well to everything from genital mutilation to domestic abuse. Their problems are THEIRS, not ours.  We can offer sympathy, but not asylum.</p>
