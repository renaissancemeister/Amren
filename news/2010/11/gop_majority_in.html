<h1>GOP Majority in House Will Push to End &#8216;Birthright Citizenship&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i> Rob Hotakainen, Sacramento Bee, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As one of its first acts, the new Congress will consider denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants who are born in the United States.</p>
<p>Those children, who are now automatically granted citizenship at birth, will be one of the first targets of the Republican-led House when it convenes in January.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, the incoming chairman of the subcommittee that oversees immigration, is expected to push a bill that would deny &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; to such children. </p>
<p>The measure, assailed by critics as unconstitutional, is an indication of how the new majority intends to flex its muscles on the volatile issue of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t like it,&#8221; said Chad Silva, statewide policy analyst for the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California. &#8220;It&rsquo;s been something that&rsquo;s been a part of America for a very long time. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For us, it sort of flies in the face of what America is about.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An estimated 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in the United States in 2008 were the children of undocumented immigrants, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center done last year.</p>
<p>The issue is dividing Republicans, too. </p>
<p>&#8220;We find both this rhetoric and this unconstitutional conduct reprehensible, insulting and a poor reflection upon Republicans,&#8221; DeeDee Blasé, the founder of Somos Republicans, a Latino GOP organization based in the Southwestern states, said in a letter to House Republican leaders.</p>
<p>Silva said the Republican plan is &#8220;not the fix,&#8221; adding that the citizenship of children born to immigrants was never an issue during the immigration tide at the turn of the 20th century and that it shouldn&rsquo;t be now.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s our strength,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And to start splitting hairs like that will only make the immigration issue worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Doris Matsui of Sacramento called King&rsquo;s plan &#8220;both unconstitutional and shortsighted.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Rep. Tom] McClintock noted that the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France and India have all changed their laws in recent years to require that at least one parent be a legal resident for the child to become a legal citizen.</p>
<p>Lungren, who served as California&rsquo;s attorney general from 1990 to 1998 introduced a similar bill in 2007, but it did not pass the House, which was controlled by Democrats at the time.</p>
<p>His bill called for defining what &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; means. Lungren proposed that the clause would apply to any person born to a parent who is a citizen, a legal alien or an alien serving in the military. <br/>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t belive them.  They&rsquo;d need to investigate the illegal adoption of the 14th Amendment, which they won&rsquo;t do.  Too much Civil Rights law and new precedence is built upon the lies.  Republicans are too desparate for Diveristy to truly govern with moral justice for America.</p>

		<p>Amazing how many insist there is no difference between democrats and republicans and that there is no hope for reform or even avoiding demographic dispossession of whites.</p>
<p>When, now, almost instantly, we see immediate drastic changes to the core issue of immigration being made.</p>
<p>It is possible to FORCE a reversal of non-white immigration in the US.  Other white nations have their own solutions paralleling ours (basically the rise of nationalism, starting in eastern europe and soon to spread all over western europe).  But for the US, tough immigration laws coupled with iron fisted enforcement is what is going to be decided on this year and next.</p>
<p>If you want your opinion heard on the matter, now is the time to speak up to your elected officials.  Whose voice is louder, ours or La Raza?  Now is the time to decide that matter.  Others have already done most of the work over the last several years and it is bearing fruit in a big way.</p>
<p>But there is still alot to do.</p>

		<p>To pass such a law would be a good start, but I remain distrustful of the Republicans - What good would it do to remove birthright citizenship if we fail to secure our borders and/or continue to bring in millions of third-world, anti-American aliens on a yearly basis?  I would feel much better if they would secure our borders, reduce immigration to zero, and then follow that with repatriation of all illegals.  Until then, (and probably in any case no matter what we do) we continue on our path towards national destruction, civil war, and new, ethno-centric States in North America.  p.s. See you at the conference.</p>

<p><br/>
Oh?  You sneaked unlawfully into our country, and now you&rsquo;re indignant that we don&rsquo;t regard your children as lawful citizens!</p>
<p>In a sane world, this should not be any issue at all.</p>
<p>I simply cannot understand what there is about this issue that&rsquo;s so bewildering to our politicians. It seems very clear-cut: if you&rsquo;re not the child of a cizizen, you&rsquo;re not a citizen either. After all, Mexico holds that the child of any Mexican, born anywhere, is a Mexican. So why should they be ALSO considered Americans?</p>
<p>What baffles me is why our government representatives seem so much more concerned about the rights and welfare of foreigners and illegal aliens than they are  about native-born American citizens!</p>

		<p>Even if the Republicans are serious about this (and I&rsquo;m EXTREMELY skeptical of anything they do), it will never fly for the simple fact the courts have long declared the 14th Amendment clearly states ANYONE born in these United States (and subject to its jurisdiction) is a citizen.  </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2acsx36" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2acsx36</a></p>
<p>Assuming such a bill ever becomes law (it won&rsquo;t) and can avoid a presidential veto (highly unlikely), it must then survive the innumerable legal challenges that will be thrown its way by the forces of the Left and the neo-con Right.  Sorry folks, but the only way you&rsquo;re ever going to end birthright citizenship for illegal aliens is to amend Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, and good luck with that, too!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to sound pessimistic but I wonder if the Republicans had taken both houses of Congress if such a proposal would have even been brought up?  They can promise the moon now knowing it will never pass the Senate or a final veto by Obama. They can easily play the game that it&rsquo;s the Democrat&rsquo;s fault, and they probably will, to score big wins in 2012.  Then if they take the Senate and the White House and they&rsquo;re actually in a position to do something it will be business as usual.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time. The original 14th amendment was to ensure citizenship for freed slaves, not for people who illegally cross the border. It&rsquo;s time for this nonsense to stop.</p>

<p>Oh, I just bet you don&rsquo;t like this at all Comrade Silva and I am certain that it &ldquo;flies in the face of what America is about,&rdquo; for invading aliens like yourself. Because it rejects and could redirect your plans for a &ldquo;Reconquista&rdquo; by your utterly worthless &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; into the gutter where it belongs.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I not only support this idea, but also would like to see it made retroactive for all &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; aliens and their whelps since around the year of 1970 or maybe even earlier. In that respect, a European American Reconquest can begin in earnest and a white majority of about 75% or greater can be Reestablished.</p>
<p>I say, may God let it be so!!!</p>

		<p>If they don&rsquo;t end birthright citizenship this country is finished as a first world country in perhaps as soon as 20 years. Some states are already finished like California which is American in name only now.  Ending birthright citizenship will not fix the problem by itself, but it may buy 20 years to come up with real solutions to fix the problem of pending overpopulation, energy stability, state budget crises, unemployment, as well as the destruction of the core of Americas European identity. If that comes along with eventually reducing total immigration to virtually nil or severely reducing and returning to the days of immigration based on population percentages, as well as a crackdown on illegal immigration both on the ground and in the workplace then it very well may solve help solve the issues. If nothing else is done, it will just prolong the inevitable on this current path of destruction. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny how many people are screaming this is &#8220;unconstitutional,&#8221; but I don&rsquo;t hear anybody complaining that current laws violating freedom of association are unconstitutional, even though freedom of association is a fundamental human right, and yet there are laws on the books that seriously curtail this right. </p>

<p>This is the most reliable cheap-shot that immigrant advocates always use to justify overwhelming the country with their numbers.  In 1900, there were still huge geographical areas that weren&rsquo;t settled.  Also, most of the immigrants were from Europe, even if it was Eastern Europe.  They were hard-working and had no political agenda or split loyalties.  They were anxious to become Americans and contribute.  These families provided most of the sons who fought in WW2.  By then, they were Americanized and since they were white, fit right into the existing culture after only some adjusting.  Even the Russian Jews made huge contributions, like in the entertainment world, often fighting against lewdness on screen.  Louie B. Mayer was famous for that.  Today, we&rsquo;ve got a real nightmare, and the country looks nearer to social chaos every week.  </p>
<p>But people like Silva think they know what is best for us, and the most &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks, Mr. Dumpty!  I missed that key point myself.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, they consistently, and DELIBERATELY, equate <i>illegal aliens</i> (who sneak across the border) with <i>immigrants  </i>(who came here legally). To them, the Marxists, and the media, they all seem unable to make any distinction. An immigrant is an immigrant. And also&hellip; &#8220;there is no such thing as an illegal human being&#8221;.</p>
<p>Logic is not a big thing with them.</p>
<p>It is the old Big Lie technique: if they say it enough times, over and over again, it will become accepted as truth that there is no distinction between legal and illegal. </p>

		<p>This is a start, but unless non-white, Muslim and other immigration that threatens the rights and lives of white Americans is permanently halted, our borders secured and the illegal aliens expelled by force, we are still doomed here to a very bloody war for our very survival, a war we could lose. As an American of Slavic descent, I have no illusions about what will happen here, thanks to my knowledge about what Muslims, Mongols and other hostiles did to my ancestors and still continue to do. They murdered, displaced, enslaved and dispossessed Ukrainians and Russians by the millions. Russia has a huge problem with Muslims who murder Russian civilians every chance they get, and these dangerous people are a huge force of potential jihadists. The same thing will happen here because they have lots of babies at the expense of whites who can barely feed themselves let alone a family through the taxes taken from them. The same fate will befall millions of whites here, thanks to these non-white invaders and their treacherous Jewish supremacist enablers along with wealthy whites who have been using them line their coffers at the expense of the rest of us. The Hispanics are to white Americans as Muslims and black Africans are to Europeans, a dire threat that will kill us off or drive us out of our own land. If they follow through on this, it would be welcome, but I think the need to secure our borders and expel all illegal aliens except the gang bangers and the ones who commit violent crimes against Americans. Those invaders should be run down and killed on sight, or executed en masse after being captured as enemy guerrilla fighters. We ransacked Mexico in search of Pancho Villa, we can do this to the drug traffickers and gang bangers who kill our people here. As for Pancho Villa, if I was in charge, I would have ordered those troops to level everything they come across the way Sherman burned his way to the sea in the south, or the way the Russians stormed into Germany at the end of WW-II.</p>

		<p>&#8220;… For us, it sort of flies in the face of what America is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh yes, because to you, America is all about unlimited welfare and taking over the country from the people who built it.</p>
<p>This whole thing is just silly.  Any American who thinks the children of illegal immigrants should be citizens is a either self-hating liberal or an idiot, or likely both.  Notice how pretty much everyone objecting to this is in the article is a minority?  The only epublican against it whom they menioned was a Hispanic.  They also mentioned a Hispanic Democrat and an Asian.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment was passed by the so-called &#8220;radical Republicans,&#8221; who became ambitious after moderate Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination, and since it isn&rsquo;t part of the Bill of Rights, guess what?  It can be amended away! They did it with the prohibiiton amendment.  That one also failed miserably, just like the 14th amendment has failed our country.  History shows us that it doesn&rsquo;t mean what it appears to say literally.  Puerto Ricans were not granted citizenship until 1917, after 20 years of being &#8220;under the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; the United States.  The Indians, who have lived here for thousand of years, citizenhip was not universally granted until 1924.  Philippinos were under our jurisdiction for decades, and never granted citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silva said the Republican plan is &ldquo;not the fix,&rdquo; adding that the citizenship of children born to immigrants was never an issue during the immigration tide at the turn of the 20th century and that it shouldn&rsquo;t be now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow.  The &#8220;children born to immigrants at the turn of the 20th century&#8221; were not ILLEGALS.  The children in question in the 14th amendment are the children of illgeal immigrants, or rather illegal aliens, not immigrants.  Also, its funny she should mention those immigrants, because it was the influx of strange foreigners at the turn of the 20th century that lead to the passage of the immigration reform acts of the 1920&rsquo;s, which honestly discriminated against immigrants not of the same stock as the people already hear.  She should hope we don&rsquo;t respond to our immigration problems the same way our ancestors at the turn of the 20th century did.</p>

		<p>the white majority needs to be firmly re-installed.  How?  By zero non white third world immigration; deportation; and mandatory birth control on non-whites here.  Will it happen?  Not for a long, the whites do not feel treaten enough yet.  Once the whites wake up and realize their home and labor have been stolen, they have no choice but to take action.  The non-whites are lower in intelligence and they know it.  Blacks/hispanics rage against the whites because they know that in every way, they cannot compete with the whites therefore, they use the race card for a racial shakedown.</p>

		<p>Think twice before you support &#8220;ending birthright citizenship.&#8221;  This would mean that even children naturally (biologically) born to U.S. citizens would not get automatic citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lungren proposed that the clause would apply to any person born to a parent who is a citizen, a legal alien or an alien serving in the military.&#8221;</p>
<p>This would only encourage recruitment of more foreigners in our military, which would please multinational Army/Navy/Marines, Inc., which now allows &#8220;legal&#8221; permanent residents to enlist.  Children born to legal aliens should be designated legal aliens.  They should be naturalized only when their parents become naturalized.</p>

		<p>This insanity and the lure of jobs are what brings illegal here. Stopping birthright citizenship and making E-Verify mandatory for all businesses would send them home.

		<p>The problem of children being born to illegals is solved by the Saudis and Kuwaitis, when a woman is pregnant and before birth she is deported! not negotiable! she is deported and no child is allowed to be born in those countries except to citizens and sometimes Americans and Brits to my knowledge, since they need us. Philippinos and Indian women are deported till after the birth and e.g. no illegal citizenship problems. Personally, I say deport all illegals no matter what.

Sorry DeeDee, but I just can&rsquo;t be Blasé about this:<br/>
there is nothing unconstitutional about getting back to correct interpretations of the Constitution   &mdash;   and interpreting the 14th Amendment as bestowing citizenship on every last mestizo &#8220;anchor nino&#8221; is incorrect. </p>
<p>If, after we get this corrected, you and your &#8220;conservative&#8221; brown brethren STILL want to vote GOP, hey, that&rsquo;s great. But don&rsquo;t expect that you can blackmail the Party into further hispandering to you just because you&rsquo;re from a fashionable nonwhite minority. That&rsquo;s what Democrats are for. </p>

		<p>It will never happen. Too politically incorrect. Constitution or no constitution, that really doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore - we pretty much lost on this issue. There are so many of them now, along with the standard PC groupthink, that the govt. will not do anything that appears anti-immigrant. </p>
<p>PS: I&rsquo;m not sure you can call this a country anymore since there&rsquo;s no common heritage, language or culture anymore. Might call it an &#8220;economic zone&#8221; or something like that&hellip;</p>

<p>Hey buddy, try voting Republican.  This is the thing about rule by mob&hellip;errr, &#8216;Republican Democracy&rsquo;.  Being elected to represent a people tends to mean only listening to those who voted for you.</p>
<p>Since Republicans vote for Big Business and Big Business sells junk consumerism to cheap labor, the real question becomes whether or not a sudden drop in currency values (with all this debt) doesn&rsquo;t stall out the &#8216;service economy&rsquo; which produces so little and imports so much.  No money = No reason in terms of supporting illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Silva said the Republican plan is &ldquo;not the fix,&rdquo; adding that the citizenship of children born to immigrants was never an issue during the immigration tide at the turn of the 20th century and that it shouldn&rsquo;t be now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Except that tens of thousands of children, parents and the like WERE turned away for either being diseased or liable to become a state charge.  And that&rsquo;s the kicker Mr. Immigrant Man sir.  Until you are _in the door, as a citizen_ you are -just- an immigrant.  Your sole jurisdictional loyalty belongs to your prior country and we owe you NOTHING.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our strength,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And to start splitting hairs like that will only make the immigration issue worse.&rdquo;<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s your strength sir.  </p>
<p>TFR = 2.4 in Mexico.</p>
<p>TFR = 3.2 in the States</p>
<p>TFR = 4.4 after Amnesty.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Democratic Rep. Doris Matsui of Sacramento called King&rsquo;s plan &ldquo;both unconstitutional and shortsighted.&rdquo;<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Nope.  You&rsquo;re ignoring the specific clause: &#8220;&hellip;and subject to it&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&#8221; is what is illegal here.  And the world would be a better place if a lot of high level officials went to jail for thinking the laws which they craft do not apply to them.</p>
<p>None of which matters right now because this is another exercise in go-slow workarounds, a &#8216;silent filibuster&rsquo; designed to do the least possible while ignoring the element needing fixed the most:</p>
<p>Secure The Border NOW.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll talk about your gross malfeasance with regard to your fiduciary duties and outright misrepresentation of what The Constitution says and means.</p>
<p>ONLY by disinvesting in the trillion dollar fraud of healthcare and pushing serious money into building and manning a border fence, IMMEDIATELY, can this government in anyway prove that they are not just another bunch of shyster&rsquo;s working for the same people as those they just replaced.<br/>

		<p>Regardless of what the MSM tells us, most Americans do not approve of swarms of third-worlders invading our land, depleting the resources of schools, hospitals, prisons, and welfare.  All we have to do to be rid of most of this rabble is to make them feel VERY unwelcome.  If illegals cannot easily obtain employment, schooling, and welfare for children, many will be detered.  Fear of imprisonment has apparently driven many from one state to another.<br/>
The 14th Amendment was created to give citizenship to freed slaves.  If the Supreme Court takes the law&rsquo;s purpose and original meaning into account, which courts have traditionally done, it would be possible that it might outlaw the anchor-baby phenomenon.  Otherwise, we might need an amendment, and Congress should start the procedure now.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;When, now, almost instantly, we see immediate drastic changes to the core issue of immigration being made.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we are seeing is the usual change in rhetoric. Nothing has actually happened yet and considering the Republican&rsquo;s record on immigration, I don&rsquo;t expect anything to ever happen.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb with politicians is to assume they&rsquo;re lying. Whatever they say, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that the opposite is the truth. So if the Republicans say they&rsquo;re going to do away with birthright citizenship, this means they&rsquo;ll probably expand it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad that House Republicans are taking a stand on illegal immigration, but I&rsquo;m pessimistic nonetheless. Any bill will have to pass a Democrat-dominated Senate and receive Obama&rsquo;s signature. So unless they do some wheeling and dealing that somehow gets Senate Democrats and a president who is staunchly anti-white to sign onto a bill that will slow our demographic decline, such an effort is unlikely to succeed at the moment. However, hopefully by making this an issue now, and showing white Americans how far in violating the laws the Democrats and our dear mulatto president will go to ensure our demographic oblivion, the Republicans will set themselves to take the Senate and White House in 2012. To anyone out there: you need to work NOW to raise white racial consciousness. We still have the demographic advantage necessary to make the government work for us. But our window of opportunity is closing, and quickly. In a decade or so, we may not be able to do it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What good would it do to remove birthright citizenship if we fail to secure our borders and/or continue to bring in millions of third-world, anti-American aliens on a yearly basis?&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly. The whole issue of &#8220;citizenship&#8221; becomes moot when the law isn&rsquo;t enforced and &#8220;illegals&#8221; can vote in elections, collect welfare and get jobs, driver&rsquo;s licenses, in-state tuition and all the rest of it. If an illegal alien can live and work here like anyone else, then the concept of citizenship becomes completely meaningless.</p>

<p>Curry Todd (Rep-Tn) was shocked recently to learn how pregnant illegals can&rsquo;t even be asked for proof of citizenship. If they make it across the border and into a hospital, their child is as good as an American.</p>

		<p>Excellent step for House GOP to take. We also would see, even if the Senate buried the idea, which the Senate would do, whether these new tough House T-Party types, Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor have an anti-immigration policy and the hormones to carry it out, even when Big Business, the Wall St Journal and the National Review types scream stop.</p>

		<p>In response to those who claim this is just &#8220;rhetoric&#8221; and who think nothing is done, or could ever be done about the illegal alien invasion, I would like to direct your attention to the following article, recently linked in a post to a popular forum you may or may not be familiar with.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3xukebj" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3xukebj</a></p>
<p>The point of drawing your attention to this is multifaceted and important.  First of all, there are places in this country that have almost zero illegal immigrants.  This is not an accident or a coincidence.  It is the result of certain specific actions taken by their elected officials with the support and activism by their constituents.</p>
<p>The idea that both parties are the same and that few to no politicians care about this issue or care about what YOU think about the issue, is a deception.  It&rsquo;s a self-deception by people who feel betrayed by liberals and helpless to change their minds in the face of what is best described as a self-destructive mental illness.  But mostly, it&rsquo;s an intentional deception by those who work for Obama, Soros, Pelosi, Reid, etc. who want you to believe that the game is rigged so you have no chance of winning.  They don&rsquo;t want you to attempt to fight back.</p>
<p>The reality is something quite different.  Most of the American population is quite angry over this issue and has turned on immigrants like a venomous snake.  The majority of politicians want the immigrants gone, for various reasons, especially on the state level.  The rest are terrified of what will happen to them and their careers, if they are discovered to be on the wrong side of this issue.</p>
<p>The battlefield is way in our favor on this issue and lots of ground is being gained.  If Missouri can do this, then the rest of the US can do this.  If Missouri went that far, they will go much farther, cutting off the invaders at their knees at every turn, harassing them, arresting them, punishing them at every turn.  Nobody will dare criticize them for it outside the worst liberal bastions and no one will take that criticism seriously.  Soon, those liberal bastions will be forced to spend their own money ONLY, if they want to be a &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221;.  How much can they afford to support before they must admit defeat and hop on board the anti-immigrant band wagon?</p>
<p>This can happen and will happen.  The only question is, will you help it happen or will you sit on your hands whining about the inevitability of white demographic dispossession?</p>
<p>There is a certain level of responsibility free men must take on about such issues.  Those who sit back and adopt a victim mentality are little better than the liberals who expect a nanny state to take care of them like sheep and are left bewildered when that system mistreats them and then does them in.</p>
<p>This ain&rsquo;t North Korea, no matter what Obama would like you to think.  People are not as complacent as they would like you to believe.  And the enemy is nowhere near as powerful as they want you to think.</p>
<p>Stop being fooled.</p>

		<p>Poster #19 hits the nail on the head, and I hope a reader here will forward this point to the Republicans involved:</p>
<p>The issue was never raised in the 20th century or before because tall those immigrants back then were, by and large, LEGAL immigrants.  The &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; today who are legal are also welcome.  </p>
<p>But the ILLEGAL immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S., being foreigners as they are who are subject to the jurisdiction of their home countries.</p>
<p>I would add that this bill would need to be retroactive at least ten years, preferably 20.</p>

<p>Before SB 1070 became law in Arizona back in April, those Missouri laws were the toughest state-level immigration laws in the country.  And to the extent that SB 1070 is tougher, MO&rsquo;s legislators are going to close the gap in 2011.  Helping their cause is that the 54% Republican State House before now will become 65% Republican run in January, and the already veto-proof Republican-run Senate will become even more Republican.  Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, hasn&rsquo;t really tipped his hand either way, but should he veto, overriding the veto is almost assured.</p>

		<p>I am usually pessimistic about such things. I am beginning to see some hope because this is even being addressed by the Republicans.<br/>
I do think some of the Tea party people are starting to understand. I did not make the step to my current consciusness in one big sweep neither did most of Amren readers.<br/>
