<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Super-parents Gil and Kelly Bates love babies so much, they can&rsquo;t stop having them.</p>
<p>The couple, from Tennessee, U.S., celebrated the birth of their 18th child a month ago and are already praying for more.</p>
<p>The Bates look set to become the biggest family in the world one day, and are one baby behind the Duggars of Arkansas, who have 19.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will have many more children if God allows it,&rsquo; said proud dad Gil, 45, a tree surgeon.</p>
<p>&#8216;Children are a blessing and God has blessed us many, many times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Devoted mum Kelly, 43, said: &#8216;We just love children and every baby brings extra joy to our family. The most exciting time is when a new baby comes.</p>
<p>&#8216;We all wonder are the boys going to be ahead, or are the girls going to be ahead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple married 23 years ago, and Kelly has been pregnant for almost every year.</p>
<p>Their massive brood range includes Zach, 21, Michaela, 20, Erin, 18, Lawson, 17, Nathan, 16, Alyssa, 15, Tori, 14, Trace, 13, Carlin, 12, Josie, 11, Katie, 10, Jackson, 8, Warden, 7, Isaiah, 5, Addallee, 4, Ellie, 3, Callie-Anna, 1, and Judson Wyatt, one month.</p>
<p>Dad Gil is busy extending their home which already has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, two kitchens, a huge dining room with a 14ft table and its own nursery and a schoolroom.</p>
<p>The Bateses make many of their own clothes and refuse to have a TV in the house, spending their spare time playing games, singing and playing instruments.</p>
<p>At weekends they go out singing together at old people&rsquo;s homes to spread goodwill.</p>
<p>Gil runs a tree surgery business with some of his older sons while Kelly, a housewife, teaches all the younger children at home.</p>
<p>The family gets through a massive amount of food each week  &mdash;  polishing off 48 eggs, four packs of bacon, 40 scones and two large loaves of bread each breakfast time.</p>
<p>&#8216;The dining table is so big I can&rsquo;t really hear the people at the far end,&rsquo; said Gil.</p>
<p>The house has four huge washing machines and two industrial dryers to cope with the seven loads of washing that needs to be done every day.</p>
<p>&#8216;The kids are very responsible and caring of each other,&rsquo; said Kelly.</p>
<p>&#8216;I hardly even cook these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gil and Kelly met at college in South Carolina in 1986.</p>
<p>They married in 1987 and Kelly fell pregnant soon after.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t want any children at all when I was younger,&rsquo; said Kelly. &#8216;I wanted to be a career woman. I didn&rsquo;t enjoy babysitting. But over time God changed my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After Gil finished college, the babies came thick and fast. For the first 15 years Kelly was pregnant every single year.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was pregnant more than I wasn&rsquo;t pregnant,&rsquo; said Kelly.</p>
<p>&#8216;I always loved having lots of brothers and sisters,&rsquo; said Zach, the eldest, 21, who is a volunteer fire fighter, as well as working for his dad.</p>
<p>&#8216;There&rsquo;s always someone to play with. There&rsquo;s always a friend. I don&rsquo;t know what being lonely feels like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the couple&rsquo;s 16th child, Ellie, now three, Kelly suffered two miscarriages.</p>
<p>&#8216;That was one of the hardest times in our lives,&rsquo; said Gil, who has delivered 11 of his children.</p>
<p>Doctors told Kelly that the miscarriages were caused by low progesterone levels so, after some hormone replacement, she fell pregnant yet again.</p>
<p>Baby number 17, Callie-Anna Bates, was born on August 2, 2009.</p>
<p>On September 15, 2010 Judson Wyatt, the family&rsquo;s eighth boy and 18th child was born.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters sometimes argue but the Bates&rsquo; say they are usually one big happy family.</p>
<p>Nathan, 17, said: &#8216;None of us would change our family for the world.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s currently eight boys and ten girls.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;ve got a bit of a race going and Mom needs to have two more boys to settle it.&rsquo;</p>

		<p> I don&rsquo;t know if the Bates family is part of the Quiverful movement, but if not they ought to be. Like the Duggers, they&rsquo;ve proved that having large families isn&rsquo;t just the province of penniless, patriarchal Muslims, or blacks on welfare.</p>
<p> As the son of a woman who had eight sisters and four brothers, I can appreciate large families. Yes, they fight on occasion; but they also look after each other. The &#8220;poor mother,&#8221; as many feminists would like to think of her, doesn&rsquo;t have to work like a slavie, picking up after everyone. Kids in big families learn cooperation.</p>
<p> But, as the Bateses are unmistakeably Caucasian, look for criticism to start in the media as soon as their story becomes well circulated. &#8220;How dare they have so many children? Don&rsquo;t they know the White race is supposed to die out, or be absorbed?&#8221; </p>

		<p>God Bless them!  What a beautiful family. Look at this family as well as the Duggars of Arkansas. The media loves picking on these people as if the women all look like school marms and the men look like they stepped out of Mayberry.  But I think both families are very attractive!  The girls are pretty and the boys are handsome. And I don&rsquo;t know much about the parents of this family here, but as much as I have seen the Duggars, the parents of that family sure are young and attractive for their age!</p>
<p>What a great display of white beauty!  All white people need to have children.  I hope to have at least three!</p>

		<p>Think of all the third worlders who have huge families, but who gets publicized? A white family, of course. The idea is to shift the spotlight onto whites to try to deflect concern about nonwhite&rsquo;s rapid population growth. Just like when the media brings up polygamy they usually trot out a white oddball or renegade Mormon. They forget to mention that it&rsquo;s legal in muslim countries and that tens of millions practice it. Just focus on the few whites in order to skew perceptions. The Bates family does look rather healthy. Better them than importing third world breeding machines. </p>

		<p>Eighteen kids for one couple is pretty bizarre, but if they are supporting them all themselves with no help from the tax payer, it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business but theirs.  Sure does help in trying to keep whites the majority, though, huh?  </p>

		<p>God bless these people!  The kids look happy and healthy.  There&rsquo;s not a word in the article about them accepting any kind of public assistance.  If only more White couples would start doing this, (or even having HALF as many kids as these folks,) we&rsquo;d get out of the disastrous future we&rsquo;re currently facing.  </p>

		<p>This is a great story.  It&rsquo;s inspiring.  </p>
<p>Especially the part where the wife was determined to be an independent career woman, and found she would rather be a mother.  </p>
<p>Christians, no TV, eating meals together; they&rsquo;ve really got a great thing going there.  I like it.  The greatest investment in the future.  </p>

		<p>I work with a young lady in Spokane, WA, who comes from a Russian immigrant family similiar to this family from Tennessee. The Russian mother had 11 children, the husband has a disability and does not work.  The mother arrived fromn Russia not knowing English and 6 years later was a registered nurse here. They also have never had a TV in the house and the kids spent their time studying, learning musical instruments.</p>
<p>The young lady is now 21 years old and working on her master&rsquo;s degree.  She is hoping to enter medical school.  Not only did she make straight A&rsquo;s in college, she set the curve in some courses.  She worked full time as a waitress while attending college - made $36,000 as a waitress last year and gave it all to her mother to help support the family while she wears 2nd hand clothes bought at thrift shops.</p>
<p>This young lady has 4 sisters, and out of the family&rsquo;s five daughters 4 of them were valevictorians of their high school classes.  She is drop dead beautiful and has never been kissed or held hands (they belong to a strict Russian Orthodox church). By the time each of these kids reach 21 years old, they have a big head start in life and bright futures.  For those of you who are wondering, they are psychologically sound and happy people.  They have never been on welfare.  Here is a well educated family of high achievers who arrived here broke and look what they have accomplished for themselves with high moral standads, a dedication to education, and a heck of a work ethic. <br>
   <br>
Maybe not such a bad lifestyle.  This is called &#8220;paying the price&#8221; and sacrificing now for a great future.  Perhaps we can learn from this experience.   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how these kids do academically in comparison with nearby &#8220;public&rsquo; school kids, but homeschooled kids often score high in standard high school test required for graduation. Then they are off to college or post grad career training with far fewer needs than the &#8220;remedial&#8221; programs the Afro and Latin descended kids from public schools need even for the most lowly community college.  </p>
<p>I hope these kids can serve as a model for the worthlessness of public schools for most children exept for the intellectually gifted, white, Jewish and Asian, who would do well in either public or private schools. </p>
<p>These kids should be examined, with their parents&rsquo; permission, to  see if they exceed the results of the local public schools.</p>

		<p>They are a beautiful family.  And I will tell you this when all is said and done the old woman who is surrounded by loving children and grandchildren will be much happier than the old woman surrounded by cats and a plaque thanking her for 30 years of services to FirstWorldTeleBank.  And what can be more fulfilling than shepherding beautiful children into successful, happy Christian adults? <br>

		<p>I had originally read this in the Daily Mail Online.  The snide comments were for the most part what one would expect from a Multi-Cult country.</p>
<p>For myself I decided to play with the numbers&hellip;</p>
<p>First Generation:  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates have 18 children.</p>
<p>Second Generation:  Each of the 18 children in turn have 18 children a piece, giving Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates 324 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Third Generation:  Each of the 324 grandchildren in turn have 18 children each, giving Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates 5,832 great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Fourth Generation: Each of the 5,832 great grandchildren in turn have 18 children each, giving Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates 104,976 great-great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Fifth Generation: Each of the 104,976 great-great grandchildren in turn have 18 children each, giving Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates 1,889,568 great-great-great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Was it McDonald&rsquo;s that had the commercial that had the slogan &#8220;I&rsquo;m loving it&#8221;?</p>
<p>Incidentally, The Bates family and the Duggers family each have their own respective web page.  The pages are easy to find.</p>

		<p>I find it sad to see people here see this as a good thing.  The key problem with the world today is over population, as it has been for years.  </p>
<p>Global warming fear seems to be the latest religion but no one wants to raise the issue of population growth.  No one wants to raise the issue of the carbon footprint increase for 3rd world immigrants to developed countries (about 1600% increase).  No one wants to raise the issue that 3rd world immigration helps prevent social and economic change in the 3rd world by allowing an easy out for a population rather than fixing the problems.</p>
<p>You can quote crime statistics all you want but the media will always edit the truth to hide the perps and highlight any victim that isn&rsquo;t white.  You can claim genetic IQ differences but no one cares, the world is full of idiots.  You can point to historical differences in colored verses white societies but all the United Nations cares about is that white people caused 2 world wars and should thus be eliminated.</p>
<p>The only thing that is acceptable to &#8216;modern&rsquo; culture, media, science, and politics was that white western societies (including the exception of Japan) had a stable or declining population.</p>
<p>Nowhere does this ever get promoted.  Media and politics cannot discuss it as it is politically incorrect (just look at the politicians that did try and raise this issue at Copenhagen).  Scientists cannot raise this issue even though the technology to reduce green house gas emissions is not developing at the pace of population growth.</p>
<p>This leaves the question open of how do we promote the fact that white western civilisation has small families and has genetically realised that we are not in balance with the world?  That having families of 18 is not acceptable in any part of the world?</p>
<p>And finally the scary part - how do we do this before we are a minority?</p>

		<p>Nice story but she is 43, if they plan to keep having babies &#8220;as long as God allows&#8221; they run a serious risk of having retarded kids. Unless they are having tests done (not likely) they will end up with a &#8220;permanent&#8221; child that can never grow up or live independantly.</p>

		<p>A part of me really cherishes that photo&hellip;not a single part of that family is darker skinned in the slightest way. A beautiful, big educated white family with a great life ahead of them without any tax payer money. But yet somewhere&hellip;one black needs every tax back-up to support one.<br>
Best of luck to the family in cherisment and blessings!</p>

		<p>What an attractive, wholesome and happy looking family&hellip;no wonder leftists hate these types of white people.  Not ethnic, practicing Christians, not living off of the state&hellip;the Bates and Duggars of America cause our leftist elites many sleepless nights.  As white awareness and pride continues to grow, I predict we will see a great increase in the number of large, racially-conscious white families.  Thanks Amren for linking to such a heart-warming story and congratulations to the Bates family.  You are role models for us all.</p>

<p>Art:</p>
<p>What you describe sounds like my dad&rsquo;s family during the depression   &mdash;   back when large families and sacrifice were the norm and welfare wasn&rsquo;t offered as a way of life.</p>
<p>And sacrifice they did.  It enabled a dirt-poor Indiana farm boy   &mdash;   whose dad preferred to hang out with hobos under the bridge   &mdash;   to be sent on a vector to earning a BA, Masters and PhD, in physics no less.  I recently received an old photo of my grandmother, in an old beat-up straw &#8216;farm hat&rsquo; with many holes in it looking as if she&rsquo;d come straight from the fields, which she probably had, standing in front of Purdue when my dad received his first college degree.  It must have been amazing for someone whose ancestors arrived in coffin ships after the Highland Clearances in Scotland.</p>
<p>That is the American Dream and the former American Way, when one was able and afforded the opportunity to rise by his own merits without government meddling and futile efforts to create a pseudo-egalitarian society based on skin color.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost our way and I see no way back for us Whites given current demographic changes and government policies   &mdash;   policies that put the government&rsquo;s boot directly on our collective White necks.</p>
<p>How far we Whites have fallen.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 14&rsquo;s comments about how many descendants there will be for this SECOND family of a score (more or less) of children, missed one joyous, exhilarating point.</p>
<p>These people will live, and procreate. They will bury (literally) the anti-family contingent in less than a century. God is good, and as He says, &#8216;Vengeance is mine.&rsquo;<br>
I&rsquo;m just smiling that my CEO has a plan for conquest, for (like the old Lutheran hymn says it,  &#8216;&hellip;.He shall win the battle.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>A good model for all whites.</p>
<p>And, to those who say things such as &#8220;As long as they are supporting them&hellip;,&#8221; I say, baloney. Just have white kids. Have as many as possible.  Things will work out. </p>

		<p>Not all foreign adoptions by white Americans, are of Hatian or black African orphans.  There are sensible white Americans who adopt white children, and/or children born here, or foreign born.</p>
<p>I have a cousin, she is not married, she adopted a beautiful white girl child, who was born in Russia.  I work at my uncle&rsquo;s real estate office, we rent apartments, and this cousin of mine is one the tenants.  I do not live there myself.</p>
<p>One day at work, in the elevator, when my cousin, her adopted daughter, a co-worker, and I where there, the co-worker said &#8220;Aw, isn&rsquo;t she adorable.  I bet she&rsquo;ll be President someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>My response was &#8220;She cannot be President!  Under the Constitution!&#8221;  I am sure everyone reading this post knows about the natural-born Constitutional requirement.</p>
<p>White people who decide to adopt children, certainly should adopt white children, regardless of whether such children were born here, or abroad.</p>

		<p>Good for them!  People are encouraged to have fewer children nowadays (unless you&rsquo;re a &#8220;minority&#8221; and just pop out babies to get more freebies).  Looking at my family tree, I saw plenty of big families.  My mother is the seventh of eight children.  Her grandfather was one of a dozen or so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like the older children can&rsquo;t help out with the younger ones, and get jobs to help support the family.</p>

		<p>Back in the early 1970s, there was a hue and cry over world population over-growth spurred on by disingenuous propaganda material and primarily directed at white countries, and thus &#8220;zero-population&#8221; movements were born. </p>
<p>Poor and un-educated 3rd world peoples never got the message, so they&rsquo;ve become responsible for the bulk of 80,000,000 world population increases <i>every</i> year. (Google Roy Beck&rsquo;s gumball video) Euro-whites are now comprised of less than 10% of the seven billion people on earth.</p>
<p>Alas, if only the brainwashed couple from my own country had learned something from the prolific Bates family, and dropped their white-guilt indoctrination lessons and had children of their own, or at least adopted children of their own shade.</p>

		<p>One reason that families like the Bates&rsquo; and that Duggars suceed is that they live in rural areas with low cost of living. In fact, Jim Bob Duggar once admitted that there is no way that his family could survive living in New York City because of the cost of living there. The same thing would exist in either Los Angeles or San Francisco where both parents and perhaps the older kids would have to work fulltime in order to support the family. In these areas, they would probably have to get food stamps or some other asistance,</p>

		<p>Bill R. #4: No, 18 children is not bizarre. My Grandfather was one of 18 children, and that was the norm. Most families had between 10 and 20 children then. And the older kids helped the parents with the raising of their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I would like to see more White families have at least half the children of my Grandfather&rsquo;s time. If they did, Whites across the Nation, and around the world would not find themselves as minorities in their traditional homelands, and in the new lands, such as America, Canada, and Australia, which we discovered, explored, and built up to what they are today. </p>

		<p>My wife and I, who are 57 and 59, respectively, live in Knoxville, Tennessee, not far from the Bates Family. The Bates are our heroes. We met the Bates at their little church off Clinton Highway in August 2010. They came right up and shook hands with us. Much of the church orchestra is composed of violin-playing Bates children, and Erin, the oldest daughter, plays the piano in the style of a concert pianist. We thought we had been catapulted back to Norman Rockwell&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>My wife and I, like most American Euro-Americans of our generation, were brainwashed by Paul Erlich&rsquo;s book, POPULATION BOMB, popular in the early 70s. Like most Euro-Americans, we  stopped at two children. The trouble is, in any generation, 25% of people never get married and/or don&rsquo;t have children. Therefore, a population of 200 million white folks, 75% of whom are having two children and the other 25% of whom are having 0 children, will result in 150 million white folks in the next generation, 112 million in the next, 84 million in the next, and so forth. That&rsquo;s why most mainline Protestant churches are shrinking; they aren&rsquo;t having kids! Evangelical church families often have three children, allowing them to keep their numbers growing. The Baptist Church is staring to shrink because so many of them have fallen into the two-child trap. In fact, there&rsquo;s a good title for a new book, THE TWO-CHILD TRAP, to counter the environmentalists&rsquo; propaganda.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to have to do  &mdash;  <br>
(A) You folks (75%) who DO have children, should consider three (3) children to maintain the population so as to account for the 25% who have NO children. Actually, four (4) children is probably best for most Caucasian families because, let&rsquo;s face it, two children are viciously competitive, three children includes a &#8220;piddling middle&#8221; child, and four children balance things out nicely.<br>
(B) If your children refuse to give you lots of grandchildren, CUT THEM OFF in your will!!! Tell them you are doing it.<br>
(C) My wife and I have considered starting an organization called &#8220;Grandparents without Grandchildren.&#8221; It would help those without grandchildren scatter their financial assets among Quiverfull families. Quiverfull families are showing great courage in having children and counting on God to provide. We should reward their courage! Dozens of local businesses and individuals donated time and money to the Bates Family to help them expand their house.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time for a new beginning for Europeans! <br>
We almost became extinct after the Black Death of the mid-1300s but we came back. The 20-somethings are the new pioneers and we baby boomers must goad them on and provide financial backing. <br>
Two steps forward and one step back, two steps forward and one step back&hellip;.</p>
