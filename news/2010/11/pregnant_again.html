			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Dolan, Daily Mail (London), November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An unemployed benefits claimant whose five children were all taken into care has vowed to continue having babies until she is granted a council house.</p>
<p>Lavine Samma, 27, is now pregnant with her sixth child and fully expects the baby to be taken from her by social services at birth, just like the last three infants.</p>
<p>Since 2002, the feckless mother has given birth to three boys and two girls by three different men and doesn&rsquo;t even know who the father is of one.</p>
<p>She does not work and rakes in around £600 a month in benefits.</p>
<p>But Miss Samma claimed yesterday that it was her &#8216;human right as a woman to have children&rsquo; and vowed to continue falling pregnant until the local authority moved her from her 16th floor inner-city council flat to a &#8216;proper council house&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When the Daily Mail called just before 11am yesterday Miss Samma was just about awake but still in bed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she quickly warmed to her theme.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m not a priority for a house because I don&rsquo;t have children with me, but if I had children in my care I would be&rsquo;, she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;If they keep taking them away from me I will just keep having them. Again and again and again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Samma, who lives in a tower block in Newtown, Birmingham, with Jamaican asylum-seeker boyfriend Damien Sewell, lost her first two children  &mdash;  a girl and a boy  &mdash;  in March 2006, when social services were tipped off that she had been neglecting the elder child, then aged three and a half.</p>
<p>Bruises and scratches were discovered on the girl&rsquo;s back and the following year the mother was found guilty of neglect.</p>
<p>She was jailed for a year and released on licence after six months.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s father left her after the birth and the couple divorced. When the second child was born in 2005, Miss Samma believed Mr Sewell was the father, but a DNA test revealed he was not. The children are now in the custody of a relative.</p>
<p>Since then, the couple have had three children together. All have been removed within hours or days of their birth by social services.</p>
<p>Miss Samma said she admitted neglecting her first two children but claimed that should not stop her from having more children in the future.</p>
<p>She said her ultimate aim was to &#8216;be a mum  &mdash;  which is my right&rsquo;, rather than to simply get a council house.</p>
<p>But she admitted that being rehoused as a result would be a &#8216;happy side-effect&rsquo; of being allowed to parent a child.</p>
<p>She claims £96.72 a fortnight in Jobseekers&rsquo; Allowance and £87 per week housing benefit.</p>
<p>But although she claims to be looking for work, she said she struggles because of depression, as well as the fact that she is pregnant.</p>
<p>She met Mr Sewell, 31, in 2002 when he came to England on a holiday visa and later claimed asylum.</p>
<p>The couple said he is unable to claim benefits but refused to comment further on his immigration status.</p>
<p>It is thought he is still waiting for a final decision on his claim.</p>
<p>Miss Samma has lived in her one-bedroom council flat since she was 18.</p>
<p>But she said she is determined to leave the property because it is riddled with mould.</p>
<p>Mr Sewell said: &#8216;The whole system is corrupt&rsquo;, he moaned. &#8216;The courts and the council, they are all against us.</p>
<p>&#8216;I know they will try and take this latest baby from us, but that won&rsquo;t stop us having more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night a spokesman for the TaxPayers&rsquo; Alliance said the case &#8216;shows why our welfare system needs so desperately to be reformed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;This woman has little incentive to go and find work, to get on in life, or to pay for her own housing, because the state is providing all of this for her.</p>
<p>The real losers in this sorry tale are the children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it is unfair for taxpayers to be asked to support people who have large numbers of children, and no intention of providing for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Birmingham City Council spokesman would not comment on individual cases but added: &#8216;The welfare of a child is always the prime consideration of the local authority whenever a decision is taken to place them in care.&rsquo;<br>

		<p> I used to think abortion was about freedom and choice and welfare was about getting a leg up. Then I read something from a &#8220;Racist&#8221; screed that changed my whole point of view.<br>
 The writer asked if anyone had ever seen one of those Science Fiction movies where astronauts fly to Mars, build an oxygen machine and then blast off leaving it to work on the atmosphere for 75 years before returning to begin colonization. I said yeah, I love that kind of thinking!! Then he said that &#8220;giving White Teenagers abortions and Black teenagers welfare for too many kids is the same damn thing, turning our planet into theirs!!&#8221; After that I never looked at abortion, welfare, rednecks or Mars the same way&hellip;</p>

<p>This the crux of the problem which future generations will have to address.  Solution = mandatory birth control.  Due to economic pressures, England is currently cutting down on non-white migration.</p>

		<p>regardless of how the lady makes her living, it is her attitude towards losing children that to me is the most chilling. The totalitarian government steals her kids just because they feel like it, as when the farmer takes away calves from a cow. So what&rsquo;s her response? Does she become depressed, or protest, or try moving to a freer country, or stop reproducing in the hope of living to see better times? No, she just keeps going at it. The oppression that would horrify whites doesn&rsquo;t faze her in the least.</p>

<p>For ten years she&rsquo;s lived on benefits. Her children will probably end up the same way.</p>
<p>There are many more like her. More are on the way, either by immigration or by birth.  </p>

		<p>My gawd, where does one begin to comment on this situation?  This woman is truly a welfare whore&hellip; IMO, she only has a right to have children for whom she is willing and able to provide.  She has no right to have them at others&rsquo; expense.  And yes, I know there are plenty of welfare whores just like her in the good old US of A.</p>

 <br>
 <br>
The human species reached its present level of development because the prehistoric equivalent of Miss Samma did not have children who survived. <br>
 <br>
Aid to Families with Dependent Children should be replaced with free abortion on demand and more and longer prison sentences. It should be easy for people like Miss Samma to get abortions. It should be very difficult for them to raise their illegitimate children. <br>
 <br>
Expensive incarceration should be replaced with hard labor. There must be labor intensive work that is too painful and dangerous for free labor to perform. </p>

<p>Well, why not just move her and her bunch into Buckingham Palace? Wouldn&rsquo;t the Queen and her blue-blooded clan like some more diverse &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; to amuse themselves with in the place? After all, hasn&rsquo;t the Queen declared herself to be a Multicultural Monarch time and time again; let us see her put her inheritance where her mouth is.</p>

		<p>This week our new government has announced a &#8216;crack-down&rsquo; on non EU immigrants. They start by &#8216;capping&rsquo; the number of highly skilled engineers who are required by UK companies who have been unable to fill their requirements due to a lack of &#8216;domestic&rsquo; applicants. What they do NOT do is start at the bottom of the pile by eradicating the tens of thousands of totally useless, uneducated, non-English speaking immigrants, most of whom remain unemployed, unemployable and totally reliant on welfare to support them from the day of arrival. Most of these are family members of those from Pakistan and Bangladesh who simply join the queue for free housing and cash hand-outs. Because they tend to have very large families, most of whom are aged, sick from TB or suffer from the many hereditary diseases caused by successive &#8216;first-cousin&rsquo; marriages demanded by their 7th century way of life, we are required to treat them at no cost to them, through our National Health system. The NHS is paid for by working English people by mandatory deductions from weekly pay. These immigrants pay nothing and demand everything. Human rights rears it&rsquo;s ugly head once more. 85% of muslim males in UK are unemployed. The benefit claimants pictured in this story may not be muslim but they too are typical of non-White, non-English residents who live their miserable lives moaning and groaning about their self imposed living conditions. Her (free) property is riddled with mould? Pity she doesn&rsquo;t open the windows more often to admit fresh air and ventilate the place. Her live-in &#8216;boy&rsquo; friend, having nothing better to do in between inpregnations, could move his bl  &mdash;  - ar  &mdash;   and paint and clean the place for which he pays no rent. When English people are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;, this is a typical example of why we think in this way.  Those children, now in care, cost about £1400 each per week to house, clothe, feed and educate, and, because they are black, no-one wants to adopt them, especially other africans. Records prove that 85% of them will have committed serious crimes by the age of 18, costing us more in policing, court time and prison than they will ever contribute to society. But I am certain that AMREN readers will know exactly what I am describing, but probably at a much higher level and at a much greater national cost. I rest my case.</p>

		<p>If you work and pay taxes and for some reason you run in to a tough time (as I did a few years back for medical reasons)it&rsquo;s damn hard to collect enough benefits just to get by. Never mind how the insurance companies and or government is constantly on your back to get back to work as soon as possible (usually before you are well again)just so you can start paying for the likes of lifers like these. Those kids will be the ones stealing your car and robbing you at gunpoint in a dozen years or so. Diversity = strength&hellip;yah right.</p>

		<p>I work in social housing and this is not uncommon, I&rsquo;ve had teenage mums screaming at me wanting an &#8216;f&rsquo;ing council house&rsquo; having never done a days work in their lives. </p>
<p>Other occasions Ive been told that as long as they have children and keep on having children we (my firm) will have to give them a bigger and bigger house and in some cases that&rsquo;s what happens, Ive rented big 5 bed houses (about half a million in 1993 when I signed them up, I guess nearly a million now) to such people.</p>
<p>I had one complain that she has to £5 pw for a two bed house in London and that&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>This story barely touches on the truth.</p>

<p>This is the problem both there and here in the USA with section 8(same as a council estate there}. The government rewards people for bad behavior and when you reward people for bad behavior, you get well, a lot more bad behavior. People who choose to have kids out of wedlock and/or when they can&rsquo;t support them are not &#8220;poor&#8221;, idiotic and irresponsible yes, but not poor. Sorry, but having a kid out of wedlock doesn&rsquo;t entitle you to a house. There are plenty of responsible married people with kids struggling to get by yet nobody gives them a house. These feckless men ought to be forced to pay for their children and these single moms ought to be told tough, you have to struggle just like anyone else and if you can&rsquo;t provide a house or food, your kids can go into an orphanage. Stop rewarding bad behavior and they will stop breeding.</p>
