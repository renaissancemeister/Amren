<h1>Murder Trial a Window Into Vicious Atlanta Gang</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The long weekend of terror started brazenly: Nine Trey Blood members rolled up to a home, leapt onto the front porch and stabbed two men after one refused to let his girlfriend leave with the group.</p>
<p>Then it grew horrific: A reluctant Blood, thinking about cutting his ties to the crew, was executed two days later, along with a teenage sidekick, in a disciplinary ritual at an Atlanta park. When the dead man&rsquo;s girlfriend had the temerity to make inquiries into his well-being, they came to her home and shot dead her 17-year-old son while he cowered in his closet. Their dog, Princess, was also killed. The woman survived the Oct. 6, 2008, attack only because the gun, aimed at her face, jammed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four of those alleged gang members involved in the 2008 crime spree are now on trial in a Fulton County courtroom, where the armed guards sometimes outnumber spectators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The trial, set to resume this week, gives an inside look at a motley cast of characters who call themselves Nine Trey Bloods and the vicious code members lived by. {snip}</p>
<p>In all, six of the 10 originally charged have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Bloods&rsquo; bible&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>The testimony portrays a fiercely aggressive gang, held together by a core of recent New Jersey transplants and manned by some star-struck locals.</p>
<p>Christmas [Darryl &#8220;Mac Jones&#8221; Christmas, 31, one of the gang on trial] was in a hurry to build up a hearty core in his adopted city, prosecutors said. Authorities say he handed out the &#8220;Bloods&rsquo; bible&#8221; to recruits, a packet of papers laying out the rules that members were called to learn and live by. They were given 31 days to absorb their new creed and were to be tested. If they failed, they&rsquo;d get a beat down.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;bible&#8221; spelled out gang vocabulary, loyalties and what a Blood should and should never do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the reality was far from the resplendent gangsta life portrayed in hip-hop videos. Several members worked in food service and recounted taking MARTA to their gang meetings and criminal activities. Christmas drove a burgundy Cadillac but it was unreliable. Seemingly, the only Blood with dependable wheels was Tyeisha &#8220;Lady Tye&#8221; Marshall, a 26-year-old New Jersey native who ran a kitchen at Turner Field and ferried Christmas and other crew members in her Chevrolet Blazer.</p>
<p>Aside from being the driver, Marshall was to teach new female members the ways of the gang. The most recent recruits were two sisters who had to fight each other as their way in. It was at their home that the two men were stabbed on Oct. 3, 2008.</p>
<p>During that incident, witnesses said, Christmas ordered four gang members to attack, then called them off by yelling &#8220;Blat!&#8221;  &mdash;  which stands for &#8220;Blood love all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Atlanta gangs have shifted from drugs and more violent endeavors to smash-and-grab burglaries that carry less risk of punishment if caught. The department has identified about 1,400 active gang members in Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Violation&rsquo; punished</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maddox  &mdash;  a lean, young ruffian who two days earlier had pounded on the two men in the ruckus on the front porch  &mdash;  recounted the situation last week in court: &#8220;Dice was gonna get DP&rsquo;d [disciplined]. Darryl Christmas said Dice was under a violation. He said, &#8216;Do you accept your violation?&rsquo; Dice said, &#8216;Yes.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was to be a barbaric ritual. Five Bloods encircled Cintron and punched and kicked him for 120 seconds as he fought back. Maddox was selected to be a discipliner, as was 15-year-old Fernando &#8220;Snoop&#8221; Wingfield, a fledgling Blood who Dice had taken under his wing and brought to the park that night.</p>
<p>Well into the beating, Cintron fell for a third time and refused to rise. &#8220;Do what you want,&#8221; he told them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Auletta stood maybe five feet from the battered Cintron and aimed a gun at his head. Snoop turned from Blood discipliner to terrified kid: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t do it!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;He&rsquo;s like my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>But young Snoop broke another Bloods&rsquo; rule, Ross said. &#8220;He showed compassion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tobin, the Iraq veteran and Christmas&rsquo; roommate, finished off Dice, Ross said. He was shot through the eye. Auletta then turned and allegedly shot the fleeing Snoop. {snip}</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t hear any of our White Humanity in Atlanta talking about this, for fear of being labeled a raciss.  Whites in Atlanta live in two constant fears: 1. black criminal violence, i.e. robbery, raping, and murdering, and 2. charges of racism.</p>
<p>If the blacks in the afrodom of the ATL rap kingdom don&rsquo;t get you through their usual tactics, they will harass you through intimidation and thuggery.  When they start calling you a raciss, you then must face the onslaught of your own Whites joining in on the attack.   Anti raciss Whites love to attack the rest of us. It earns them status and bona fides with the blacks, and may help stave off demands that they surrender their own jobs to more deserving blacks in the near future.  </p>
<p>Today I voted at a church.  The voting machines were against a wall, and above them were framed pictures of great Western religious art, all White Humanity, and Jesus was very White, as he should be.   The vast majority of voters were sullen and thoroughly unattractive blacks of the female breeding gender. The poll workers looked like the security at a NAACP meeting. As a White Awarian, I could feel the hatred.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a sullen black with a typical ATL attitude crossing the street in front of a car driven by a White Man.  When the black got across, he turned and looked straight into the eye of the White and then spewed spit all over the street.  They do that as an intimidation tactic and a sign of hateful disrespect.    Frequently, when I walk past these ATL blacks, they spit on the sidewalk as they see me approach.  They often start talking about white this or white that.  </p>
<p>After all we&rsquo;ve done for them, this is what we get?  Can&rsquo;t send them back home to Africa soon enough. They are the torment and ruin of my White Republic.  All the bad that happens in this country is because of them.  As the segregation song goes, &#8220;The hate is gett&rsquo;n bigger.&#8221;  Yes, Lawdy Mercy, it sho is, and it will keep on getting bigger until it is BIG ENOUGH to make a difference for our White Humanity.</p>
<p>Racial Reckoning: Transcend Diversity, Embrace Whiteness, Beware &amp; Prepare, and put your White daughter on the pill! Blacks have an uncanny way of knowing when beautiful White girls are ovulating.</p>

		<p>Strange how the Atlanta cops attest that this is not a nation-wide system because the locals have all switched from urban crime (drugs = territorial = staked claims) to housing crime (smash and grab = coming soon to -your- neighborhood) due to there being less chance of getting caught.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, one of the two ringleaders was calling out of town to ajudicate an in-house problem and left it to others to finish a called hit (which is apparently what it had always been) because this &#8216;Dice&rsquo; person had _cooperated with cops_ (shot house = drug house).</p>
<p>Which, to me, sounds more like the cops coopted a weak link, turned him and someone learned about it from inside the establishment.</p>
<p>This is not a limited, neighborhood, level set of offenders.  This is a major move into a &#8216;new market&rsquo; by someone out of state, using expendable entry personalities with the right skin color and the right (poor = low key) profile.  And I&rsquo;m betting that the APD somehow got wind of it via this &#8216;house&rsquo; and shut it down.</p>
<p>Now someone&rsquo;s trying to clear away the corpses and cover for their damage control methods.  I must say, their targeting appears to be dead on.  But their CIs sure do seem to suffer for it.</p>
<p>Hmmmm, oh yeah.  Revolvers don&rsquo;t typically &#8216;jam&rsquo; so much as expend all their cylinders.  If you can click twice without a boom, it&rsquo;s time for a reload, not a clear.</p>

		<p>So Atlanta is where the Bloods are these days?</p>
<p>YOU CAN HAVE &#8216;EM!</p>
<p>The bloods were formed in Los Angeles, in the early 70s, mainly in Compton  &mdash;  a once White city, turned black, now 57% hispanic (and increasing), down to 17% black.  &#8220;Historic&#8221; Watts, once an Italian enclave, turned black, is now 60% hispanic, 40% black.</p>
<p>According to blackamericaweb.com:</p>
<p>Late black activist Terry Anderson testified before Congress about the effects of unfettered hispanic immigration on the black community in LA:</p>
<p><i>They won&rsquo;t tell you of how skilled black workers in Los Angeles can no longer ply their trade&hellip;Body and fenders, roofers, framers, drywallers, gardeners and now even truck drivers. They don&rsquo;t dare tell you about all of the race riots in our schools. We have schools here that used to be 80 percent to 90 percent black and now &hellip; are 80 percent to 90 percent Latino &hellip; The illegals won&rsquo;t hire us and won&rsquo;t buy from us. And still our black elected officials won&rsquo;t help us&hellip;.our leaders have sold us out</i></p>
<p><br>
<i> When I was 16 or 17, I had jobs at McDonald&rsquo;s, Burger King, Jack in the Box. Now these jobs in L.A. are held by 30- or 40-year-old immigrants – 100 percent Spanish-speaking and probably 90 percent from Mexico.</i></p>
<p>Ready for the <i>coup de grace?</i></p>
<p><b>Folks at the Southern Poverty Law Center dismissed Anderson as a tool of white racists.</b> </p>
<p>O, the irony!</p>
<p>Listen up you folks in Atlanta! We in Los Angeles will happily ship you as many prison busloads as needed full of hispanic gang members from Florencia-13, Avenues, or the bloody salvadorean MS13 to control and rid your city of black gangs and criminals</p>
<p>It worked for us.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>The death penalty would be good for these wretches. Governments all across the world are taking crime too lightly. Before America starts another war in the Middle East, it should be rooting out the threat on its own soil. Its price is one of eroding trust, suspicion for neighbours and a disconnection from society out of fear.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, I read an article in the Houston Chronicle. Seems a decorated Marine and his wife were visiting New Orleans. Walking like typical tourists, the wife was suddenly harassed and insulted by a local. The Marine, trying to protect his wife, was murdered by the knife-carrying local. Given this was, after all, New Orleans, with a decades-long reputation for crime and violence, it does not take rocket-scientist intelligence to assume the killer was a Black. Damned few White men would be low enough to cold-bloodedly murder a decorated Marine wearing his dress uniform in public. A man who risked his life for his country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Atlanta gangs have shifted from drugs and more violent endeavors to smash-and-grab burglaries that carry less risk of punishment if caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>These black gangs shifted to mindless stuff like smash-and-grabs because that&rsquo;s all they can handle. &#8220;Drugs and more violent endeavors&#8221; are big-league rackets which require intelligence and a certain degree of sophistication to hold together and blacks aren&rsquo;t any better at crime than they are at anything else. Judging by this story, I&rsquo;d say we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the Atlanta Nine-Trey Bloods evolving into a serious criminal organization. They just don&rsquo;t have the collective intelligence for it.<br>

<p>One of the reasons so many black and Hispanic gang bangers are staying away from the drug trade is because so many kids are growing up with silver smartphones in their mouths, that they don&rsquo;t want to give them up in order to go &#8220;low pro,&#8221; so as not to create a subpoena-able trail that will get them right into Federal prison.</p>

		<p>Bon, I sincerely appreciate your generous offer of a free shipment of Mexican gangs, and I truly hope you don&rsquo;t feel slighted if, regretfully, we in the Atlanta area feel obliged to turn it down.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanic gangs (including a particularly large number of MS13&rsquo;s from San Salvador) in Atlanta is extremely underestimated and underreported, due to many of the gangs conducting their activities &#8216;technically&rsquo; outside Atlanta.(It keeps down the crime figures for the City convention and tourist trade.) Thus the Hispanics are based in the neighboring counties, particularly Gwinnett. </p>
<p>Though the report is correct that a huge number of crimes in Atlanta are now &#8216;smash &amp; grabs&rsquo;, in no way does it indicate that the more serious crimes are being converted to less violent ones. They are simply being added to. One of the newest schemes is busting out the windows and breaking into cars in the upscale and luxury hotels with 24 hour parking surveillance. Of course, the traditional driving a stolen vehicle through the windows of downtown clothing stores for the $200 &amp; $300 jeans still tops their activities.</p>

		<p>Russian proverb&hellip;&#8221;when it happens to you, then you will know that it&rsquo;s true.&#8221;  I&rsquo;ve lived in the metro Atlanta area 30+ years. I learned quickly how to survive. The actual city of Atlanta has been a rat hole since the 1960s.  It has never gotten better save in the minds of deluded liberals.  Even animals with the tiniest of brains have survival instincts and learn quickly.  White liberals who pride themselves on their knowledge of &#8220;evolution&#8221; can&rsquo;t seem to catch up with gutter rats when it comes to this.  They are typically the white victims of this behavior.  Be aware&hellip; it&rsquo;s got to get a lot worse before people wake up.  Most whites are still asleep, being medicated with diversity pills at their jobs, churches, schools, and of course all media outlets.   Until it happens to them&hellip;</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve said many times before, we need to hear about more cases where attackers such as these wind up dead at the hands of their intended victims and when possible the victims should leave the scene immediately. BTW use a revolver to avoid telltale shell casings.</p>
