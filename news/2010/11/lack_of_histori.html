<h1><a href="https://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/11/18/16204626.html">Lack of Historical Knowledge Threatens Canada&rsquo;s Future: Minister</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Lilley, Toronto Sun, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney warned a conference of historians and educators that unless we do a better job of teaching history and common values, we risk social unrest in the future.</p>
<p>Kenney said there is a need for both native-born Canadians and newcomers to have a solid understanding of Canada&rsquo;s past including our political system, and how Canada&rsquo;s culture of rights and responsibilities developed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we continue to swear in 180,000 citizens every year from over 180 countries of origin if we are not sure that they have a common understanding of the country of which they are becoming full members as citizens?&#8221; Kenney said.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters after his event, Kenney acknowledged that part of the problem for immigrants trying to understand Canada is that so few native-born Canadians have a grasp on the country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why the government says that &#8216;Discover Canada&rsquo; and our efforts to promote civic literacy have to be focused on all Canadians and not just newcomers,&#8221; Kenney said.</p>
<p>Discover Canada is the government&rsquo;s study guide issued to help immigrants prepare for their citizenship test. It was released last year and replaced an older guide that spent little time on Canadian history but did teach would-be citizens the importance of recycling.</p>
<p>Kenney also took a shot at how Canadian history is often taught, saying there is too much emphasis put on social history and some recounts of Canada&rsquo;s story make it sound like the country was built of oppression and injustice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that indeed is the way in which we seek to teach history, no wonder that young people aren&rsquo;t particularly interested,&#8221; Kenney said.</p>
<p>Kenney called Quebec a model for teaching history to its young people, saying that while some may quibble about how that history is presented, there is no question that students in that province are taught history.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Kenney also took a shot at how Canadian history is often taught, saying there is too much emphasis put on social history and some recounts of Canada&rsquo;s story make it sound like the country was built of oppression and injustice.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have been dealing with that for years here in the States.</p>
<p>It is my sincere belief, after working with &#8216;history&rsquo; teachers for over 20 years in four different school environments that almost no &#8216;history&rsquo; teachers know anything outside:</p>
<p>1) Native Americans were healers and nature buffs.</p>
<p>2) All the European explorers were nasty brutes.</p>
<p>3) America was built on slave labor and oppression of the indians and Chinese (and now Mexicans) and nothing else.</p>
<p>4) The holocaust is a crime shared by all white people everywhere</p>
<p>5) Nasty white folks had to be brought to heel by enlightend blacks who marched in noble nonviolence</p>
<p>6) Nasty whites are not dying fast enough to usher in the black/brown paradise that America was meant to be.</p>
<p>This list may make you laugh, but it makes me cry, because this is all I ever see and hear in any history class I visit or curriculum I review.</p>

		<p>We have had liberals/democrats writing and censoring our childrens textbooks for probably forty years now, and they&rsquo;re surprised that there are no white european role models. I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>

		<p>&#8220;so few native-born Canadians have a grasp on the country&rsquo;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have to bet it is that way in ALMOST ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD! No matter where you travel, it is more or less the same way?</p>
<p>And history too not just in dates and events but basic concepts, beliefs, etc. That too, and understanding of same, is sorely lacking. NOT just in the U.S. and Canada, but just about anywhere.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;we risk social unrest in the future.&#8221;: I laughed at this comment.  He knows the score, but just can&rsquo;t bring himself to admit it. It&rsquo;s called Civil War, as the colonizing invaders (immigrants not at all interested in Canadian history), use &#8220;social unrest&#8221; to kill or otherwise displace and replace the White-Canadian population.  As for knowing history, if he thinks lessons in &#8220;civic literacy&#8221; will help turn anti-White, anti-Western Africans and Islamists into good Canadians, then he is one who lacks any sense of history regarding the rise and fall of nations.</p>

		<p>In support of #1 Jay&rsquo;s superb post on the nature of history instruction in the U. S., a technique publishers of history textbooks use to denigrate Americans of earlier generations, is to use present-day standards of behavior to evaluate people who lived in the distant past.  This is called &#8220;presentism.&#8221; </p>
<p>NYU research professor Diane Ravitch&rsquo;s description of the voluminous &ldquo;bias and sensitivity&rdquo; guidelines of textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill illustrates the application of &ldquo;presentism&rdquo;: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn p. 44) </p>
<p>Note: ALL publishers of textbooks who hope to market to public schools engage in pre-emptive censorship by means of such &ldquo;bias and sensitivity&rdquo; guidelines.  Ravitch&rsquo;s THE LANGUAGE POLICE exhibits in mountainous and ugly detail why governmentg schools CANNOT teach history or literature.</p>

<p><i>Kenney called Quebec a model for teaching history to its young people, saying that while some may quibble about how that history is presented, there is no question that students in that province are taught history.</i></p>
<p><br>
The Quebecois are very nationalistic. Not nationalistic about <i>Canada</i>, you understand, just about <i>Quebec</i>. French-Canadians, as a federally certified Oppressed Minority Group, are still allowed to be proud of their ethnic identity, which English-Canadians nowadays   &mdash;   like Americans   &mdash;   are not. </p>
<p>Would I like to see Anglo-Canadian schools promote Anglo-Canadian history the way French-Canadian schools promote French-Canadian history? Sure I would   &mdash;   but increased teaching is not the only way for Canada to get the levels of historical knowledge and patriotism that Minister Kenney claims to want. There&rsquo;s also a second   &mdash;   and very <i>obvious</i>   &mdash;   way to do it, that I&rsquo;d also like to see this Minister endorse (although I&rsquo;m not holding my breath), and that is is <i>drastically curtail immigration</i> by all these incompatible Third Worlders who are so resistant to becoming Canadian! Rather than spending more time teaching Canadian history in the attempt to turn Pashtuns, Pakistanis, Sunnis, Gypsies, Mestizos, Zulus, Uighers, Rastafarians, etc, into tocque-wearing hockey-playing hoseheads, you could of course make your job a whole lot easier and just <i>stop letting them all in.</i> </p>
<p>It no longer matters if these people turning into Canadians if they&rsquo;re not in Canada, now does it? </p>
<p>As I said: not holding my breath to hear this suggested by ANY politician. </p>

		<p>I agree with the sentiment, but am skeptical about how it will be taught.</p>
<p>For example, will it emphasize the continuity of white civilization from Europe replicating itself in the New World, or will it attempt to highlight black soldiers in British service or Chinese contract labourers as evidence that these races had an equal hand in building the country?</p>
<p>This could be one of the biggest exercises in revisionist history and multicult propaganda that Canada has ever seen.  </p>

<p>The answer is no but do Canadian leaders care? Again the answer is no.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have standards. Standards are RACIST.<br>

		<p>Canada had about three or four THOUSAND slaves in their centuries long history. That&rsquo;s thousands, NOT millions. Of course they feel guilty&hellip;they&rsquo;re CANADIANS!</p>

		<p>Mass immigration is a huge tidal wave that sweeps all before it.  This is just another example, popular on both the left and the right, of pretending that you can control the effects of giving away your territory to foreigners and making your people a hated minority in an occupied nation by implementing some  government program, in this case school programs.    The plain fact is that Canada&rsquo;s white history is irrelevant to the colonizers.  The problem isn&rsquo;t that they don&rsquo;t know Canada&rsquo;s history,  it isn&rsquo;t even that they don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s that the historical nation of Canada doesn&rsquo;t really exist anymore, a fact that will only become more obvious in the future,  and it is pointless to teach the history of a dead nation except as a cold academic exercise, and the new occupants are not the sort to be intellectually curious about dead civilizations.   The answer isn&rsquo;t more school programs, the answer isn&rsquo;t for whites to have more children, the answer is to stop non-white immigration to Canada.  This is a PR stunt aimed at whites who are alarmed at the decay of their culture and nation, designed to lull them for a little while longer while the treasonous elite continue what they know to be the extermination of all things Canadian.  Don&rsquo;t buy it.  </p>

		<p>Not teaching history properly is a method for the ruling class to hold on to power.  This is something known since the classical age but of course the lack of history keeps people from knowing that.</p>
