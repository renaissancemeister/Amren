<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inside Tu Books, a new publisher focusing on multicultural SF and fantasy books for kidsScience fiction and fantasy books for younger audiences are booming  &mdash;  but they still mostly feature white heroes and are aimed at white audiences. So Stacy Whitman is launching Tu Books, a new publisher of multicultural children&rsquo;s and young-adult SF.</p>
<p>Whitman, a former editor with Wizards of the Coast imprint Mirrorstone Books, decided to start Tu Books as an independent small press {snip}</p>
<p>The books that Whitman has acquired include:</p>
<p>    * a YA paranormal thriller, tentatively called Wolf Mark, by Joseph Bruchac, author of Codetalker and Skeleton Man. &#8220;When Lucas King&rsquo;s covert-ops father is kidnapped and his best friend, Meena, put in danger, Lucas&rsquo;s only chance to save them is hidden away in an abandoned, monster-guarded mansion: a skin that will let him walk as a wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>    * Galaxy Games by Greg Fishbone, a MG science fiction comedic space adventure trilogy about an incoming asteroid that turns out to be an alien spaceship, visiting Earth to recruit a team of kid athletes to compete in the upcoming Galaxy Games Tournament.</p>
<p>    * Tankborn by Karen Sandler, a YA science fiction dystopia about &#8220;best friends Kayla and Mishalla, genetically engineered slaves on the planet Loka, whose developing friendships with higher-status boys lead them to question the strict caste system of their world.&#8221;</p>
<p>    * Vodnik by Bryce Moore, &#8220;the story of a Roma boy who returns home to Slovakia after a devastating fire, and discovers his roots extend deeper into the country of his birth than he ever imagined.&#8221; (This one is coming in Spring 2012).</p>
<p>We spoke to Whitman about getting into publishing, and why she felt like there was a need for multicultural YA and children&rsquo;s SF books.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>When you raised over $10,000 on Kickstarter, what do you think it says about the need for multicultural YA fantasy?</b></p>
<p>First, on a personal level, I&rsquo;ve had roughly twenty roommates who were people of color and/or from other countries, so I&rsquo;ve often thought about issues of diversity. I learned a lot from them that I didn&rsquo;t know as deeply before, such as the reality of white privilege. In fact, I hesitated to start a publishing company dedicated to diversity because I thought, &#8220;Who am I, a white girl who grew up on a farm, to try such a thing?&#8221; But with the encouragement of friends and writers and readers, things worked out.</p>
<p>Publicly, awareness was high because of Racefail and whitewashing  &mdash;  of various book covers, and even the movie version of Avatar: The Last Airbender. It wasn&rsquo;t just me that these issues mattered to. {snip} And diversity is something the SFF community has been talking about for a while. {snip}</p>
<p><b>I see on the Tu Books site that you say that you&rsquo;re not aiming to publish &#8220;niche&#8221; books or aim at just one community  &mdash;  do you think that multicultural fantasy can appeal to a wider audience?</b></p>
<p>If you ask how many people of color enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s not a large number, though there are some. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because fantasy and SF stories don&rsquo;t appeal to a wide swath of people. I think part of it is that it&rsquo;s a genre historically dominated by white heroes, meaning that often young readers who don&rsquo;t see themselves reflected in the genre might turn to other books that mirror them more fully. By reaching out with &#8220;mirror&#8221; books to readers of color who could enjoy fantasy, we share the joy of a great genre with those who will hopefully grow up to become lifelong readers and writers of SFF.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say, though, that our books will be only for people of color. While multicultural books are often considered &#8220;niche&#8221; books, I think that can pigeonhole them. Fantasy often asks its readers to walk into a world completely unfamiliar to them, so why not a world influenced by a non-Western culture, or featuring main characters of color? It&rsquo;s not a new idea  &mdash;  some SFF authors have always kept this in mind  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s something we need more of.</p>
<p>So in *addition* to marketing to a core &#8220;multicultural&#8221; audience, we&rsquo;ll market to a core genre audience  &mdash;  that is, it&rsquo;s not an either-or. What matters to me is the story  &mdash;  note how in our rights report we didn&rsquo;t mention that the main character of Joe Bruchac&rsquo;s book above is Abenaki, or that the star of Galaxy Games is Japanese American, etc. These details are important, but ultimately the stories are about much more than just the race of the characters. The fact that the main character in Galaxy Games is Japanese American *does* inform who he is, but so does the fact that he&rsquo;s a boy who has an asteroid named after him that&rsquo;s hurtling toward Earth, destined to doom us all. :)</p>

Anyone of any race can write any genre of fiction they want.</p>
<p>Can they compete or compare with Arthur C. Clarke on profound anachronisms or Douglas Adams on outrageously funny alien species? That&rsquo;s up to the market to decide.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t believe in creating iconic work through initiatives. If a creative writer has the talent, they will produce lasting characters and works.</p>
<p>I dispute the assert that most SF is written for a white audience. Writers, white, black or other, write from a perspective, usually their own.</p>
<p>If blacks or others want to give it a try they are free to do so. Ultimately the quality of their work will be the measure of their success.   </p>

<p>Another case of a white trying to save nonwhites from those other (racist) whites (and really trying to save nonwhites from themselves).</p>
<p>How big an issue is the race of most science fiction characters anyway? I&rsquo;d be surprised if it ever comes up. Read one of the old &#8220;Tom Swift&#8221; novels and see how often race is mentioned. </p>
<p>But if nonwhites are reading less science fiction than whites, it must be &#8220;racist,&#8221; and thus the need to create a series of explicitly race-based novels.</p>

		<p>They have a point but sometimes I feel like the whole field of science fiction Exists to question the multicult. . i.e. non-whites and their special causes endorsed by the left. . in much the same way the bakesale in the previous story is supposed to raise awareness. . It&rsquo;s like calling for more colored faces at a whiteness studies seminar?</p>

		<p>Harvard is too white, the Tea Party is too white, the right is too white, the Navy is too white and now books are too white? Since when did this phrase become a four letter word? Why have we allowed this to happen to us? What are we going to do about it? I&rsquo;m SICK of hearing those words said as if it&rsquo;s a filthy, dirty thing. We are doomed if we don&rsquo;t start fighting back.</p>

		<p>Been a scifi/fantasy fan all my life.</p>
<p>Unless you consciously inject race as a character trait, the average reader isn&rsquo;t looking for race.  Of course you can use names to identify unspoken characteristics, such as &#8220;the evil scientist Dr. Wu letting loose his minions,&#8221; but it can be done tastefully.</p>
<p>But to make race a center piece of the story?  You won&rsquo;t win any white readers who are looking for starships/dragons and not a social justice lesson.</p>
<p>Besides, BLACKS DON&rsquo;T READ MUCH, if this new publisher hasn&rsquo;t noticed.  Even the so called &#8220;black books&#8221; are read more by whites than blacks.  Even Oprah was/is supported by a largely white viewership. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to see blacks in scifi shows because it is a little unbelievable.  &#8220;Captain DeQuan Brown, the nubian prince of the planet Zimbawenat, slicked back his afro and cocked his laser gun at the alien&hellip;&#8221;   It just doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>People like to read stories with themselves reflected in it.  I highly doubt Chinese writers are worried about including diversity in their books and novels.</p>
<p>Scifi/fantasy is another of those genres invented exclusively by white people according to our literary tastes.  There are many excellent writers of this genre, both past and present, and they are all white.</p>
<p>I doubt there&rsquo;s a budding Isaac Asimov or Clifford Simak or Jules Verne, etc waiting in some ghetto classroom in Detroit to be discovered.</p>

		<p>Leigh Brackett had a black cjaracter. Robert Heinlein had a few non white characters. <br>
   Most science fiction stories focus on the action. Most of the time you don&rsquo;t know what the character looks like. Non-whites are not interested in SF because they are not interested in science. Putting non white characters in their story is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>SF has not steered entirely clear of race. Perhaps Tu Books would be interested in something by Robert Heinlein such as Farnhams Freehold? A story set in the midwest where in the future whites are slaves and sex slaves to formerly African Americans. They&rsquo;re named &#8216;Lord Protectors&rsquo; in the future. Perhaps they would prefer a story by Pierre Boulle?  </p>

		<p>I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy but with the coming filming of the Hobbit, I dare say they will introduce &#8220;people of color&#8221; charactors as the first 3 had none except for the evil Orcs. Just a guess mind you.</p>

		<p>No blacks in Sci-Fi?  Let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s Uhuru, the black Spock (from Voyager), an angry, brooding black man (Sisko), and a Stevie Wonder engineer with an IQ of 180.  My god, there was even a black Klingon with a white (alien?) girlfriend.</p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;ve had roughly twenty roommates who were people of color&hellip;  I learned a lot from them that I didn&rsquo;t know as deeply before, such as the reality of white privilege.</i></p>
<p>Another typical white woman ashamed of her race.</p>
<p><i>If you ask how many people of color enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s not a large number&hellip; I think part of it is that it&rsquo;s a genre historically dominated by white heroes&hellip;</i></p>
<p>OK, it&rsquo;s the white man&rsquo;s fault blacks don&rsquo;t read&hellip;along with everything else that&rsquo;s dysfunctional with them, it seems.  And by the way, she always says &#8220;people of color.&#8221;  Why the euphemism?  It&rsquo;s clear what color she means from viewing the video.</p>
<p><i>Children who love to read do better is school.</i></p>
<p>So if only blacks are able to read about other blacks they&rsquo;ll do better in school?  This is simply a version of the standard liberal non-sequitur that attempts to explain the academic failure of blacks on the lack of black role models, along with white racism.</p>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s not to say, though, that our books will be only for people of color&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got news for you, honey, the vast majority of the books will be read (if they are read at all) by guilty whites, just like you.  But I can see these popping up on junior high school reading lists.  In which case they&rsquo;ll be read by white adolescent girls, since the blacks don&rsquo;t care about it, at all.</p>
<p>Well, one thing&rsquo;s for sure, the idea contained within the stories, that blacks are out to save the white dominated world, is certainly science fiction, and is also a major fantasy.</p>

		<p>This is the greatest idea I&rsquo;ve encountered, since I read about the Ebonical search engine to replace Google &amp; Bing. Women authors should stick to Gothics &amp; mysteries, which they do better than or as well as men. I am a long time SF fan, and I have never read any SF by a woman that I read again. Their work is insipid and unimaginative. Also few women and minorities are SF fans, I doubt if the material that Ms. Whitman will publish will change that. </p>
<p>But who knows, in crazy America anything is possible, she may become very wealthy from her combining Diversity and SF. Especially if school libraries buy her product.</p>

		<p>Good luck selling any of those books once you demand a minority be on the cover.  Patrons of books wisely and correctly interpret black characters on the fronts of most(and by most I mean 99.9%) of novels as an indication of whether the book contains a &#8216;ghetto&rsquo; story.  </p>
<p>Black books generally follow a fairly standard plot.  Man/woman begins in ghetto.  Somehow rises up from ghetto(sticking it to the white man is an option add-on in this portion).  Becomes sucessful member of community.</p>
<p>I am generalizing, of course.  But stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason.</p>

		<p>You could have a book titled &#8220;Star Rap&#8221; with Captain Snoop Dog and First Officer P. Diddy piloting the Starship Escalade. They could be assisted by the ship&rsquo;s benevolent physician, Dr. Dre, and the skilled engineering officer, Homey (Demarcus Homes). They could travel the universe looking for white people (those &#8220;strange new worlds&#8221;) to rob or maybe even move in next door.</p>
<p>Still, no blacks would read the book. Why? Blacks don&rsquo;t read. In fact, many blacks can&rsquo;t read. And do you think they would actually BUY the book. Fat chance.</p>
<p>Stacy Whitman, the clown behind this goofy idea, has real problems. Why the self-hatred? Why is this her mission? I think she has a mental disorder - besides having a bad business plan.</p>
<p>And there are two other problems. </p>
<p>First, if the main criteria for publication is a black hero then the writing and the story take on less importance. That&rsquo;s backwards. You are almost guaranteeing failure. </p>
<p>Second, let&rsquo;s say this moronic venture gets off the ground. What will happen is that sales will be weak. So they&rsquo;ll do a survey and find out the reading material was too complicated for black teens. So they&rsquo;ll dumb down the product. This will drive any remaining white readers away. And no blacks will read the dumbed-down works anyway.</p>
<p>Lastly, this being America, if there was a market for black Sci-Fi stories, it would have already been tapped. And white paternalism persists - why should white Stacy save the day when this apparently pressing problem should really be addressed by blacks themselves. There are 40 million + blacks in the US - how come none of them are gearing up to publish ebonic Sci-Fi. Oh, because most blacks can&rsquo;t write.</p>
