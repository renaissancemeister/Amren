			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meghan E. Irons, Boston Globe, October 29, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Melville Avenue in Dorchester might seem an unremarkable stretch of neatly kept Victorians and tended lawns, with the occasional picket fence. But the street, tucked between the worn three-deckers of Fields Corner and Codman Square, has a prized quality: It is safe.</p>
<p>Each Halloween, hundreds  &mdash;  some say thousands  &mdash;  of costumed children come on foot and by the carload from nearby blocks and farther away in Mattapan and Roxbury for what their parents worry they will not get at home: a night of trick-or-treating without fear of violence.</p>
<p>Throngs have come for years, turning Oct. 31 into an event that some residents prepare for with parties and huge caches of candy.</p>
<p>This year, fear of violence could make the crowds even bigger. In the aftermath of a wave of slayings that included two 14-year-olds and the grisly shooting of a mother and her 2-year-old son, Mayor Thomas M. Menino has ordered police patrols stepped up and special Halloween events in the neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Few residents seem to know how the street became a Halloween hotspot. They don&rsquo;t advertise. Yet each year, school buses, vans, and sport utility vehicles pull up, spilling youngsters in costume and their parents onto Melville Avenue and neighboring streets.</p>
<p>Neighbors say the children are polite and often wait patiently with their parents or chaperone for their share of the goods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melville Avenue is not the only Boston street that draws scores of city children. Many also trek to Ashmont Hill and Savin Hill areas in Dorchester or to streets in Hyde Park.</p>

		<p>In Austin, TX a lot of west side (white) neighborhoods get tons of Hispanics spilling in from south and east looking for candy.  Part of it I think is that there is better candy in those neighborhoods, and undoubtedly it is friendlier and safer.</p>
<p>I know some neighborhoods in some cities require wristbands, so that only neighborhood residents and not &#8220;gibs me dat&#8221; hands out minorities demanding more freebies get candy.</p>

		<p>I see this in the collar white suburbs surrounding chicago. Carloads of urban &#8216;chillun&rsquo; swarm the streets with military precision, gathering up all they can get. While most of the white neighbors are good natured and generous, an increasing segment simply is &#8216;not home&rsquo; and do not participate. And another american tradition is destroyed by black greed! </p>

		<p>I heard a story about a White neighborhood that once went all out for Halloween- big yard displays and lots of candy for the kiddies.  The word got out to a nearby &#8220;black community,&#8221; and then the next year, the blacks swarmed the White neighborhood and grabbed all the candy in a general melee.</p>
<p>The most heartwarming part of the story was that the White father of two White daughters related that his very sensible and race realist daughters said that they didn&rsquo;t want to go back there again the next year!   Think God Above in White Heaven for good little White girls who don&rsquo;t want to be around swarms of blacks!</p>
<p>I drove through a White neighborhood Sunday night that borders a &#8220;black community.&#8221;  Sure enough, the blacks were swarming with huge bags and filling them with candy from each White home.  The Whites didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, so maybe it was some kind of tradition.  Then I realized that any White who lives in that neighborhood voted for Obama and John Lewis, the civil rights icon who does nothing but make life miserable for Whites.</p>
<p>I could heard the dred locked big brothers who waited on the street all say &#8220;How much you get?&#8221; when the trick or treaters returned from the White homes.</p>
<p>To blacks, it all comes down to &#8220;how much you get?&#8221; from Whitey.</p>
<p>From me, they get nothing but the contempt  and discrimination they&rsquo;ve earned, any chance I can give it to them without being killed for doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Blacks have the entire government, fed. and muni., as well as billions of Civil Rights Activists dollars available to them for  punishing people like us.  We must stay a secret as possible. They must never know our Oaths.</p>
<p>Whites in America are not free, we do not have White Liberty, and we must come together to put a stop to our own dispossession.  We must force White Liberal Elites to suffer the Diversity Curse by shaming them into stepping down and giving up their jobs to blacks.  No White liberal should ever have a job that a black wants.</p>

		<p>This is how it is in my neighborhood for the most part.  All kids should be able to enjoy Halloween no matter the race, but enough with the mysterious tone of the article.  The residents of this neighborhood know full well why they get an influx of black people during Halloween.  Black people rarely tip much less give out candy for strangers, couple that with the violence in a typical black neighborhood and there you have it.      </p>

		<p>Minorities have been going into White neighborhoods for decades now. They think they are going to get better stuff and more of the freebies. I haven&rsquo;t answered the door for years now on Halloween. Most kids are all mexcian and blacks. to begin with. It is too dangerous to open your door at night to anyone including these minority kids. They get enough of Whitey&rsquo;s free stuff and taxes. They also can have some adult ready to pounce and rush inside the door. This has already happened. </p>

		<p>This happens in NJ were van loads of undesirables invade white neigborhoods for trick or treat.  I, and most of my neighbors, keep our porch lights off and don&rsquo;t answer the door.  In the late 90s it would sometimes get a little anonying because they would ring the door bell over and over but now we have peace and a reputation as an unfriendly neighborhood.  This year only had one showed up on my dark porch.</p>

		<p>I used to live in a small urban area where Halloween was a neighborhood affair. Then cars started coming in with loads of black children. They were not polite. After a few years of this, the neighborhood association stopped all trick or treating and, instead, held a party for the neighborhood children.</p>

		<p>More Blacks looking for handouts from White people. Yet even after years of getting free candy from Whites, these Black youths will surely turn around and curse White people as racists the first time they don&rsquo;t get their way.</p>

		<p>Boo! Now, want to hear something really scary?!? I live in one of those neighborhoods that see a few White Kids that are neighbors and groups of other kids shipped in by the carload. This year they seemd to have a mark on my back, but better them than me eating stale candy for the next week. So I was generous to all. <br>
 Well, when I went out to do the trash this morning, I found some kind of hobo sign on the edge of my driveway. It was an orange clear cup slit up the side to make a directional arrow and placed over one of my sprinkler heads pointing right up the driveway. What to make of it I don`t know except it might explain why I continued to get knocks even after the lights were off&hellip;</p>

		<p>This is a common thing. I live in a more working class neighborhood and was advised to take my daughter to the other side of the valley to the wealthier neighborhoods so that it would be safer and we would get more candy. With poor weather on Saturday night and not as many people handing out candy on the actual Halloween it was pretty much a bust. I will seriously think about going to another neighborhood next year although as a child I was not allowed to trick or treat outside our own area. As long as the kids are polite and wait their turn I can certainly understand parental regards for safety. I would also venture a guess that a large percentage of children were White. When I pass out candy I stop and shut off lights as soon as I see bigger kids who dont even bother to wear a costume. </p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder what makes these areas so much safer than the streets those &#8216;kids&rsquo; come from? Notice no mention of race either, I guess we&rsquo;re all to think that White suburban kids are going to the hood to trick-or-treat.<br>
This has been going on since I was a kid. The baby mommas\baby daddies would drive their chillin out to the evil- White- racissss neighborhoods for &#8220;mo bedda&#8221; candy. Some of the chillin were 6ft. tall with facial hair - truly frightening even without costume.  Ten year old Cadillacs,Lincolns and Electra 225s would line the street. The next morning everyone would have to take inventory on what was &#8216;missing&rsquo; from their property and which flower beds got trampled. </p>

		<p>More cars dropping off African-American kids in our neighborhood this year for Halloween as well.  The two most interesting things I found this year though were 1) The new costumes - which consisted of regular street clothes and a back pack turned around and worn on the front so as to be a &#8220;bag&#8221; for candy, and 2) Older children asking for extra or more candy due to &#8220;They not be many kids out tonight&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Safe? That&rsquo;s not the reason. The reason is because this stretch of Avenue has become famous for residents willing to shell out three to five hundred dollars worth of candy every Halloween. How many residents on the streets they come from can afford to shell out money for candy at all. Safe? Pitiful!</p>

		<p>This is an ironic microcosm of blacks in America. While they scream and blame and point fingers about their failures they simply go on remaining dependent on whites for what is essentially their very survival through food stamps, welfare payments, and so on.</p>
<p>Any amount of self-respect or effort at improvement is absent. </p>
<p>Now they are dragging their kids to white neighborhoods just to collect more free goodies from these so-called oppressors. If they had any brains they would step back and see what this tells their children. First, when you want something - go ask the white man. Next, as a people, we are so incompetent we can&rsquo;t even manage to get it together for one night when all that&rsquo;s required is to hand out some candy for a few hours.</p>
<p>I believe any self-respecting group would not behave this way. The time and effort required to get across town should be used instead to clean up their own neighborhoods for a safe Halloween. This perpetuates their own problems. And, is there not even an ounce of shame on some level?</p>
<p>Lastly, I like this part of the article: &#8220;Neighbors say the children are polite and often wait patiently&hellip;for their share of the goods.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is an odd thing to write. Most kids (and many are just little kids, after all) seem to be generally polite and thankful on Halloween so why even include the information. I think what this liberal reporter is saying - without even realizing it and perhaps exposing her own subconscious thoughts - is that the little visitors didn&rsquo;t act the way you might expect. They didn&rsquo;t pull a gun or bust a cap or steal things or attack white children or curse and demand more candy. So basically, since it is common knowledge that black behavior is so generally dysfunctional, now a disclaimer is required to point out that no apparent crimes were committed.</p>
<p>I find this entire episode revolting.</p>

		<p>Always, ALWAYS, they come to whites for our affluence and a feeling of safety. Never in the history of mankind has it been any other way. We&rsquo;re supposed to be tolerant, compassionate, and good natured, while they can be as surly and hateful as they like because everybody knows whitey be preeeeejdist.</p>
<p>A few years ago, white Southern Californians were mildly annoyed by the phenomenon of Latino families driving their kids great distances to trick-or-treat in their neighborhoods. Though certainly not as obnoxious or dangerous as blacks, the kids were annoying and would never think of saying thank you. What&rsquo;s with that tendency of Mexican kids to run around screeching every time they&rsquo;re in a public place? The parents, for their part, would hover in the background with that innocently stupid grin they put on when they know they&rsquo;re mooching off white people and that the white people will be too polite to do anything about it.</p>

		<p>As soon as I heard from a friend that this article had been posted on American Renaissance, I did an Internet search on Yahoo and Google.  I found there that a few posts about this had been sent to Craig&rsquo;s List from cities back east, but following the links resulted in a message that these posts had been deleted.  One of the partial messages which turned up on the search engines said that Obama had ordered federal busing of black children into Caucasian neighborhoods for trick or treating.  Anybody know anything about these allegations?  </p>

		<p>&#8221; I stop and shut off lights as soon as I see big kids who don`t even bother to wear a costume&hellip;&#8221;-Spartan24<br>
Exactly! But I tried another tack this year. My price  for candy is getting the kids to &#8220;Tell me what you are&hellip;&#8221; <br>
For starters, it shows how many kids don`t even understand English. Not that that`s a crime on Halloween. But it is almost pathetic how many kids in a black tee-shirt will say, &#8220;I`m a fireman!&#8221; Or &#8220;I`m an NBA player&hellip;&#8221; Why they wouldn`t wear the jersey they wear to school the next day to add credability is beyond me. <br>
 So I`ve started giving out extra candy to those kids who make an effort to dress out. And chastize those who don`t. There was one fourteen year old who got the minimal amount and then a lecture from me. &#8220;Kid, if this was Junior High, I`d flunk you for not even trying to complete the assignment&hellip;&#8221; It really gavce me an insight into study habits and work ethic. If they can`t even be bothered to produce on THEIR favorite night of the year, why should I bother for them. They are not completing their part of the Halloween transaction.<br>
   My girlfriend chastised me severly for playing favorites in front of the other children. But their was one liitle nine year old who won the prize. She came up dressed in gingham and a long blonde wig. Didn`t know who she was, Pippi Longstocking? or Heidi? but it was painfully obvious she was one of us. When I asked her the sixty-four dollar question, she said, &#8220;I`m Rapunzel!&#8221; I loaded that little girl down with so many sweets she lurched off my front porch like a freight train filled to the brim with so much Kansas City Beef&hellip;</p>

<p>My elderly grandparents live in a semi rural neighborhood on the edge of Tulsa OK that does not look particularly inviting for Halloween due to large fenced yards with gates. One Halloween quite a few years ago around 9pm a large group of black adults with no costumes on knocked on their door. My grandmother was so upset by this that they never bothered to pass out candy again. After this episode they turned off all lights and locked their gate on Halloween night. I think it took quite a bit of nerve for adults to go out &#8220;trick or treating&#8221; without any costume and at an hour that most kids are home examining their loot. I think that Halloween parties are the way to go, especially since dangerous neighborhoods are spilling into decent neighborhoods on Halloween night. I think the neighborhood that had the wristband had the right idea- also limiting the time that kids could be out would work too- 6-8pm is about right since people do have to work and go to school the next day.</p>

		<p>Today, they range up to 13 yr. old kids (no others qualify), but what happens in later years when they remember where you live and have <i>upped the ante</i> for more freebies that don&rsquo;t include candy at your <i>front</i> door?</p>
<p>And, how often have we read of murdered homeowners, especially women who once provided small jobs to handymen who became familiar with the layout of their houses?  </p>

		<p>When I was a child,  way back when, the trick or treating was for neighborhood kids - locals. I hever heard of anybody coming in from out of the area!  The people who opened their doors to you were neighbors whom you knew and who knew you.  It was safer for everyone that way too   &mdash;   though I don&rsquo;t think safety was ever an issue that crossed anybody&rsquo;s minds then.  Nor did parents accompany their kid!   Trick or treating was a kids&rsquo; thing, no parents allowed.  Well, the world was safer then.  I guess all that has changed with integration. Another of the bessings of the Multiculty  Revolution!</p>
<p>Now, this is just one more way in which blacks expect to take and whites are expected to give.</p>

		<p>Old timer- exactly! My grandparents would not allow me to go beyond our immediate neighborhood although quite a few kids got to go to neighborhoods in the surrounding town and even some went to the larger town about 10 miles away to get more candy. It was felt that there were quite enough homes in our area to get plenty of candy and it was not necessary to drive to get more stuff! </p>

		<p>Oh, how I love living way out in the country. We haven&rsquo;t had trick or treaters in the 30-some years I&rsquo;ve lived on my 15 acres, except for grandchildren when they were young enough to be driven to our house by their parents.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart that things aren&rsquo;t like they used to be when I was a child, and you trick-or-treated in your own neighborhood (because it was inconceivable that you &#8216;cheat&rsquo; and go where you don&rsquo;t live), or that it was in any way dangerous to have one night of spooky fun.</p>

		<p>Regarding the costumes of older &#8220;children&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have to admit that many years ago my college-age son went out on one last trick-or-treat. He went to an upscale neighborhood dressed in a suit and with a briefcase labeled &#8220;IRS&#8221;. A number of people told him it was the scarest costume they&rsquo;d seen.</p>

		<p>When I lived in Texas hordes of illegal aliens descended on our neighborhood on Halloween. Over the 18 years we lived there it just got worse and worse each year. <br>

		<p><i>&#8220;what happens in later years when they remember where you live and have upped the ante for more freebies that don&rsquo;t include candy at your front door?  And, how often have we read of murdered homeowners&hellip;..?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><br>
The kids may not notice, but I&rsquo;m sure the adults among them are noticing which houses look the nicest, which homeowners are elderly, which have strategically placed shrubbery, etc. And they&rsquo;ll be back for  another non-Halloween visit. They won&rsquo;t be looking for candy the next time.  </p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know&hellip; not all blacks are bad, and you can&rsquo;t tar and feather everyone just because of a few.  That&rsquo;s true, but all it take is one out of a hundred to come back to pay you a surprise visit.   That one will do it.</p>

		<p>My sister lives in a suburb some ways outside of Denver. Her neighbourhood was invaded by Mexicans and other ethnics on Halloween. She had 240 of them show up at her door. Finally she turned off all the lights because she had run out of candy.</p>

		<p>My husband and I live in a quiet older development. All of the houses are on 1-2 acre lots. There are no sidewalks. When we first moved here 20 years ago we used to get trick-or-treaters, but no more. Seems like all the kids grew up and the couples moving in don&rsquo;t have children or have very few. So far, we&rsquo;ve been lucky, we haven&rsquo;t had a brown/black invasion on Halloween. </p>
<p>Anyway, my husband said to me, why don&rsquo;t we go out to dinner somewhere so we&rsquo;re not even home if some trick-or-treaters come around? I said, what are you, crazy? What about our dogs? We&rsquo;re going to leave them here alone to fend for themselves? No way!</p>
<p>Remember a few years ago, I think it was in Philadelphia or Baltimore? A White man was giving out candy to all the little diversity trick-or treaters and his little dog disappeared. Apparently, one of the diversities had stolen his dog. As I recall, it was never found. </p>
<p>When I was a kid the worst we did was soap a window or stuff toilet paper (clean) into a mailbox. God, those wre the good old days!    </p>

		<p>In the town I live in, there are various &#8220;trunk or treat&#8221; locations where people can participate by doling out the treats from the trunk of their cars. They are sponsored by the downtown improvement association, various service clubs and fraternal organizations. Some have costume contests, music, etc. The great thing about this set up it precludes a bunch of carpet baggers swooping in, as the sites are well monitored. </p>

		<p>I remember a black co-worker once told me that her mother always said &#8220;If you want anything, you have to go through the white man.&#8221;  I could think of nothing to say in response to that and just looked at her. I really wished I had asked her why it is that black people do that. Of course, I already know why but I wanted to hear her reasoning. </p>

<p>The worst I can remember was having a clothesline cut (which really got my mother upset). That was considered downright malicious.   But if you weren&rsquo;t home to give a treat, you got a &#8220;trick&#8221; instead.  Better to come up with some candy or an apple and give them a treat.  </p>
<p>But of course, these were neighborhood kids, not unknown hordes of hundreds that were trucked in from out of the area to cash in on all the loot they could get.  Halloween hadn&rsquo;t gotten that efficient or organized yet! It was just a simple holiday.<br>

		<p>In my Southern, liberal, state capital an area of town that has beautiful remastered 1930&rsquo;s homes, all chic with the lib union bosses, state workers, far left clergy, etc., they went all out last year for Halloween.  The neigborhood association met busily to prepare a special treat for the chilluns.  When I saw this advertised I laughed for 5 min straight.  Oh man I just had visions of the little vandals descending on these old white hippies.  Since I drive through that area to bring my children to school I should be able to take photos of the before and after.  Well audience, it is just as you expected, this area, about 1 1/2 miles square was absolutely the best show of Halloween I had ever seen.  It was a showcase of displays, music and treats.  Artistic and cool.  Well sir, post Halloween it looked just like the aftermath of a cat 4 hurricane.  As I traveled through the neighborhood I slowly surveyed the destruction.  Just about every street was littered with candy wrappers and fragments of Halloween displays.  The entire ghetto had been delivered.  In talking to some folks outside cleaning up, they told me church buses and even flatbed trailers showed up carting at least a few thousand into the neighborhood.  Rude, destructive, and locust-like tricksters had shown up.  So did the idiots learn a valuable lesson?  Many had break ins to cars, property carted off such as chairs, hoses, and even some had pets kidnapped!  This year, you guessed it, the display of altruism is gone, most houses were not even decorated as a beginning and ending of a tradition, a celebration to the stupidity of white liberals now ends.  Frankly, I was a bit surprised they didn&rsquo;t try again.  </p>

		<p>I lived in an older neighborhood where all the local kids were grown up and moved away, and every Halloween the place was flooded with black teenagers and children.  I don&rsquo;t know why the local black churches didn&rsquo;t put on some kind of party for Halloween for their kids   &mdash;   lots of the white churches do.  </p>
<p>After a couple of years, I kept the porch light turned off, but I would NEVER go out on Halloween, because of fear of vandalism and fear of my dogs getting set loose from the backyard.</p>
<p>I never took my own kids trick or treating (they always went to church parties) so I never felt that I owed anybody anything.  None of the kids coming to my door were from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is too bad that trick or treating as a tradition is dying out in white neighborhoods, but the kiddies like the church parties, too, and if enough neighborhoods stop handing out candy, the riff raff will stay home.</p>

		<p>I live in So Cal, so it&rsquo;s not blacks that come knocking on my door, it&rsquo;s mexican anchor babies and illegal invaders. Unfortunately, there are several third-world barrios just miles away which browns reside. Too bad ICE does not increase their presence during Halloween&hellip;.</p>
