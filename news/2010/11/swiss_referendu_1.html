<h1><a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE6AR1GK20101128?sp=true">Swiss Referendum Backs Expelling Convicted Foreigners</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Catherine Bosley and Anne Richardson, Reuters, November 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A majority of Swiss voted in a referendum on Sunday to ease the expulsion of foreigners convicted of serious crimes such as murder, the latest sign of growing hostility to immigration in the Alpine state.</p>
<p>Some 53 percent of voters accepted a proposal to deport automatically foreigners convicted of crimes including rape or trafficking in drugs or people, according to returns published by Swiss television.</p>
<p>A committee will draw up a draft law that minimizes any conflict with Switzerland&rsquo;s international obligations, the government said. The law will then be voted on by parliament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The expulsion initiative was put forward by the right-wing Swiss People&rsquo;s Party (SVP), which has mined increasing fear about immigration in recent years to become the country&rsquo;s biggest political movement.</p>
<p>Posters for the SVP&rsquo;s proposal show a group of white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag. They first ran when the SVP was collecting signatures for the referendum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>VIOLATION OF ANTI-BIAS TREATIES?</p>
<p>Critics have said the SVP&rsquo;s proposal could contravene international anti-discrimination treaties and the free movement of peoples under European Union law. Switzerland is outside the EU, but has accepted the bloc&rsquo;s code allowing EU citizens to take up residence without special permission.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Swiss official figures show that foreigners  &mdash;  who make up more than a fifth of Switzerland&rsquo;s population of 7.7 million  &mdash;  are disproportionately charged with crimes.</p>
<p>Turnout was 53 percent, above the usual 40 percent in Swiss referendums, Swiss television reported.</p>
<p>Last year the Swiss endorsed a ban on construction of new minarets, drawing international condemnation.</p>

		<p>One can only imagine how much better this country would be if all serious convicted criminals served their sentences and then were handed deportation notices to leave the country.  Let them go get rehabilitated in another country of their choice. Better yet we&rsquo;ll pay a third world country to take them. </p>
<p>United States citizenship should be considered a privilege and not an irrevocable right especially for criminal &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. </p>
<p>If you join a club and break its rules you are expelled from that club, why should  US citizenship be any different?<br/>

		<p>ROOT OF ALL USA&rsquo;S PROBLEMS:  A MISTAKE IN THE CONSTITUTION.<br/>
SOLUTION:  BINDING SUPERSEDING NATIONAL REFERENDA</p>
<p>Great article.  The Swiss are lucky to have national referenda, so why not the USA?</p>
<p>The reason our politicians continue to import aliens despite the terrible harm to society and public opposition (80-90% against) is because there are no NATIONAL REFERENDA in the United States.  Many other countries, including 3rd world countries, have it, but not the US!  Therefore America&rsquo;s secret shame is that we do not have a real democracy!  That is why American pseudodemocracy is a joke.   Our criminal govt. must be ashamed going around the world preaching democracy but denying it to its own people!</p>
<p>The three branches have become corrupt, usurped power, and all three branches figured out that it is better to conspire, mug and terrorize the nation and totally ignore the owners, the US Citizens.  </p>
<p>So they keep imposing tyranny on us with impunity. We must be ashamed that despite thinking of ourselves as a &#8220;world-class&#8221; advanced nation, our country is so backward and primitive that we do not even national referenda!</p>
<p>	But there is a solution to this govt&rsquo;s war on the nation.  It is a constitutional amendment to allow irreversible binding superseding national referenda, so people can pass good laws in the national interest themselves. These laws will supersede laws passed by Congress and cannot be overturned except on constitutional grounds by a supermajority of both houses and a unanimous vote of the Supreme Court.  The people can then still override it with a 66% vote.   Some believe that this right to amend the constitution is inherently vested in the American public (the US citizens).  Others suggest an actual amendment.  A survey showed that 76% of the public approved the idea.</p>
<p>We can pass a national referendum that all laws that affect the nation as a whole, such as raising taxes, large welfare programs, foreign aid, immigration, bailouts, and raising the debt ceilings, etc. can become law only if finally approved by the people.  We will solve 90% of our problems this way.</p>
<p>  For eg., see:</p>
<p>http://ni4d.us/index.htm  <br/>
<a href="http://www.iandrinstitute.org/National%20I&amp;R.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iandrinstitute.org/National%20I&R.htm;</a></p>
<p>We Americans need to visit these websites, join these groups, contribute and call radio talk shows, etc. and promote this idea and get the process started soon, before it is too late.<br/>

		<p>as an American who has lived in Europe for years who has  watched the Europeans claw their way back slowly to sanity, I have to say, this is yet another milestone to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Switzerland has no white underclass to speak of (which would have helped them grow accustomed to general dysfunction) and little prior experience with the chaos of Third World immigration, so their  &#8220;racist prejudices&#8221; have not yet been purged after decades of brainwashing.</p>
<p>still, the collective psychosis of multiculturalism prevails:<br/>
sane people do not need a referendum outlawing putting your eyes out with your own toothbrush, stabbing yourself to death with your own dinner fork, or throwing yourself out in 7th story window.</p>
<p>these glimmers of sanity (handy dandy tips for running a country: don&rsquo;t invite terrorists and criminals into your country and shower them with billions of dollars in benefits while putting people in jail for criticizing them) give us reason to hope, but they are just the beginning.</p>
<p> <br/>
Islam lamb will own Europe SOON unless Europeans cast off the multicultural psychosis and find a renewed sense of urgency and militancy in fighting this totalitarian, imperialistic, warrior religion.</p>

		<p>In the USA, the only time you hear liberals speak in favor of deporting an illegal alien, is to spare them the death penalty or long-term incarceration for crimes committed against American citizens. Many states now consider it thrifty to deport seriously violent illegal aliens rather than locking them in prison.</p>
<p>This is a grave mistake. Deportation has become a &#8220;Get Out of Jail Free&#8221; card. After a short visit with friends and relatives, they cross the US border and re-enter the country&hellip;.later to murder, assault, rape, and rob more Americans. LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. That is the only way to keep Americans safe, short of capital punishment. Deportation ONLY means they walk Scot-free, ready to victimize even more Americans.<br/>

		<p>This is quite funny.</p>
<p>When a few years ago, the Swiss rejected the SVP proposal to allow community secret ballots with regards to new citizenship applicants, the media hailed it as a triumph of Swiss democracy. </p>
<p>But when the Swiss vote down minarets and foreign criminals (imagine that!), there&rsquo;s obviously a problem with the direct democracy system. I don&rsquo;t know whether this kind of contradiction in perception is either something to laugh at, or whether it should make me cry.</p>
<p>This has an even greater mandate than the majority of Swiss referenda. But no, apparently the Swiss have become evil people. Of course no one also talks about the fact that although the SVP is Switzerland&rsquo;s largest party by a clear margin (29% in the 2007 federal elections), it is underrepresented in the government. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if, with further referenda like this, the government decides to scrap the direct democracy system entirely in favor of a more traditional parliamentary system, like in other European countries. Fortunately for the Swiss, that might be difficult, consider that such would require a constitutional amendment, and such amendments need to be approved by a majority of Swiss citizens as well as a majority of Swiss cantons.</p>

		<p>Switzerland does not have birthright citizenship. Apparently, much of the uproar about this has to do with the assertion that many of the immigrants in question are immigrants of the second and third generation. Most Americans have difficulty wrapping their heads around the concept of &#8220;second and third generation immigrants&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Soon the percentage of those who are foreigners, or those who are in a relationship with a foreigner, will rise above 50%. We already see that in the US, where the percentage of non-whites who are newborns approaches 50%.</p>

<p>Perhaps they should switch it to &#8216;anyone convicted of a serious crime - such as a sexual predator - should be kicked out of the country&rsquo;. In America, perhaps 80% of the people would vote for that. </p>

		<p>James #5: I liked your post. Now,please visit the web site for the Council of Conservative Citizens at www.cofcc.org and read where the Senate voted to pass S510, which will Criminilize Citizens for saving vegetable seeds, and planting their own backyard gardens, under the &#8220;Food Safety Act&#8221; which has nothing to do with Food Safety, but everything to do with giving more power to the FDA, which will further harass, fine, and imprison, American Citizens with a vegetable garden, as well as the small Family Farmers, Farmers Markets, and Ranchers. </p>
<p>This bill goes a long way to protect Monsanto and the AgriBusiness with their Gentetically Modified Foods. </p>
<p>We the People no longer have any Freedom in this Country, if this Senate can muster the balls to deprive the Citizens of their most basic Human Right, to grow and eat their own food.</p>
<p>Futher information about this agregious bill can be found at the web site for Natural News www.naturalnews.com . </p>
<p>See how your Senator voted, and let him or her know that you are not happy with it.</p>
