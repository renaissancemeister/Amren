			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i> Daily Mail (London), Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They fly helicopter missions, deploy tactical strike teams and gather field intelligence, but the battles they fight aren&rsquo;t in the Middle East, they&rsquo;re in America.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety is engaged in an undeclared war with Mexican drug cartels, running militaristic operations day and night.</p>
<p>&#8216;I never thought that we&rsquo;d be in this paramilitary type of engagement,&rsquo; Captain Stacy Holland told Fox News of her work with the DPS. &#8216;It&rsquo;s a war on the border.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In recent years, the drug cartels have adopted increasingly terrorist-like behaviour. </p>
<p>The DPS is now flying missions in 16 state-of-the-art helicopters as they battle the Mexican gangs.</p>
<p>The gang members are armed with powerful AK-47s, are dressed in camouflage and they recruit ex-prisoners from America to do their dirty work. </p>
<p>They employ spotters to hide by the Rio Grande and alert to U.S. officials patrolling the border.</p>
<p>The cartels have executed more than 10,000 people since January, including American citizens, holiday-makers and innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>According to Texas DPS Director Steven McCraw, Mexican drug cartels move about $25billion from their US drug sales back into Mexico in a single year. </p>
<p>But, law enforcement have confiscated just $130million in illegal drug proceeds during the last four years,</p>
<p>&#8216;It certainly is a war in a sense that we&rsquo;re doing what we can to protect Texans and the rest of the nation from clearly a threat that has emerged over the last several years,&rsquo; said McCraw, who runs the undeclared war.</p>
<p>The Texas forces must constantly adapt new strategies, as the cartels try new tricks. </p>
<p>&#8216;Recently they&rsquo;ve adapted their tactics to utilize smaller loads, cross with rafts, stolen vehicles on our side,&rsquo; McGraw told Fox News. </p>
<p>&#8216;To suggest the southwest border is secure is ridiculous,&rsquo; Holland said.<br>

<p>Where does that money come from?  I would propose that virtually ALL of it comes from welfare to non-whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the achilles heal of the &#8220;drug lords&#8221;.  Simply pass a law that mandates monthly drug testing of all welfare recipients, with permanent lifetime bans from all welfare of any kind.  Within a year, the &#8220;drug lords&#8221; would cease to exist.</p>
<p>A side benefit is almost all mexicans would leave the US.</p>

		<p>The sad thing in all of this is that for roughly $10 per every American, we could have a state of the art REAL fence that would span the entire US-Mexican border.  That is about four cups of coffee at Starbucks, two if they are lattes.  For that we would significantly gain the upper hand with the smugglers permanently putting them on the defensive.  Having a double row concertina wire / concrete fence with car barriers would allow our forces to keep out all but the most highly motivated invaders and to detect and hunt them down if they did cross.  One can only dream.  </p>

		<p>I read today where journalists suggested sending in US troops to Mexico.  They claimed that Columbia was able to shake its drug cartel problem&hellip;.which had grown into an insurgency of sorts&hellip;..only with the assistance of the US military.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  Pablo Escobar was slowly gaining control and influence over the entire country, winning many of the populace to his side.  But he got impatient and over reached a bit too far by trying to legitimately secure a seat in government which was opposed by too many politicians not on his payroll, and the ones who were did not have the power to back him strongly enough.</p>
<p>The US gave the government military advisors, money, equipment and arms, but it was not US aide that brought the cartel leader down. It did put a crimp in his operations, but it wasn&rsquo;t a  linchpin that was the controlling factor in his destruction.</p>
<p>He mostly brought himself to ruin.  If he had been a bit more capable, he could have taken over the entire country, US aide or not.</p>
<p>If he had succeeded, the US might well have been forced to send  military forces into the country, creating an Iraqi-like war pretty close to its borders.  How that would have turned out is anybody&rsquo;s guess, because most of the terrain in Columbia is similar to Vietnam.  Defeating an insurgency in a jungle environment is ten times the task it is in desert areas.  </p>
<p>The Mexican cartels&hellip;.right now&hellip;. are even stronger than Escobar was, militarily and economically.  But they&rsquo;re split into mostly five factions each one pursuing its own interests and declaring certain territories their own, and they&rsquo;re all fighting for control of the main corridors to the US drug market.</p>
<p>If the US were to send in troops to assist the Mexican government against the cartels there, the action just might force the cartels to create a truce of sorts and combine as one, giving rise to a much more powerful force than the Iraqi insurgency. </p>
<p>If such a scenario doesn&rsquo;t occur, then it&rsquo;s very possible the cartels will continue to chip away at the federales until they kill them with a thousand cuts, as they are obviously in the process of doing right now, as well as gaining power and influence in the US.  The situation is a critical one.  At last count by the Mexican press it was estimated that 31,000 people have been killed since 2006, which is on a par with about any outright war zone areas.</p>
<p>And if the situation continues to the point where Mexico becomes a full-fledged narco-state, then the US will have no alternative but to attack and try their hand at nation-building there.</p>
<p>We could well be coming into an era where the US economy is collapsing into a severe depression, causing secessionist movements and armed low intensity conflicts, while militant jihadists are blowing up structures within the US, and cartels are in the process of taking complete control of Mexico with vast numbers of drug gang insurgency elements in the Southwest, which have the ability to recruit from the existing illegal alien population already there.</p>
<p>We have been brought to this very dangerous period in time mostly through the failure of the government to properly guard our borders and ports, and an insane desire by elitists to create a diverse populace, most of which will give their loyalty to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>And they add insult to injury when they require us to give lip service to the lie that, &#8220;Diversity is our strength,&#8221;  when in fact, diversity is our weakness, and diversity will eventually be our downfall.  </p>

		<p>A superb post by ranger, who explains a nightmare scenario with clarity &amp; knowledge. In the UK, the same brand of cultural Marxist politicians are gutting our country from the inside, with their criminally insane immigration &#8216;policy&rsquo;. Our troops are in Afghanistan (along with US forces), supposedly &#8216;making our streets safer&rsquo;. When these streets are full of imported Muslims that despise us, &amp; work tirelessly for our destruction. Talk about taking a viper to your bosom.<br>
The situation is way beyond ironic - it&rsquo;s catastrophic.As is your problem with the Mexican invasion. At the root of both problems, lie the despicable white neoliberal fanatics who permit these terrible situations to fester, &, of course, live a pampered life light years away from the consequences of their terrible policies. I hope to God the US finds the politicians to get you out of this appalling hole. Diversity is not our strength, it will be our downfall.</p>

		<p>To this very day, fifty-seven years after the Korean war ENDED the USA still maintains 28,000 troops guarding South Korea&rsquo;s border, even though the south has twice the north&rsquo;s population and forty times its GDP. Meanwhile it utterly ignores its own broken border at home. Go figure. As a side note the USA could consider ending its ludicrous &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  ranger.</p>
<p>You make some very good points but this one concerns me.</p>
<p>Mexico is very tribal, its various ethnic groups speaking 60 languages, and is in the throes of a civil war, an insurgency, as Hilary Clinton herself stated in September (before obama rebuked her claiming that mexico is a &#8216;democracy&rsquo; and &#8216;vibrant&rsquo;).</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2efrtlh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2efrtlh</a></p>
<p>Drugs are a source of revenue used to fund  guerrilla armies that are fighting for independence from the corrupt central government.  The USGs support for Mexico&rsquo;s government means the US is an enemy of the guerrillas and assures Mexico&rsquo;s civil war spills into the US (as it already has).</p>
<p><i>Bloomberg reports that gangs from mexico have already established a network stretching across 231 US cities.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2925wus" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/2925wus</a></p>
<p><i>A single gang in Sinaloa controls an area 23,000 square miles, its leader, El Chapo, is listed as #41 on Forbes list of the world&rsquo;s most powerful people.  This gang supposedly has operations in 78 US cities.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/27e3htl" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/27e3htl</a></p>
<p>The solution?  Let Mexico break up into ethno-states, along tribal lines, as did the old Soviet Union, and for heaven sake, the US should keep clear of this tarpit and build an Isreali-style fence along the entire border.  </p>
<p>The ONLY way to nation-build, to dominate and subdue warring ethnic tribes is by the force of a strong, Soviet-style, police-state government, which will drive even more Mexican refugees into the US as they escape the chaos, tyranny  and anarchy.</p>
<p>This information comes from a non-statist, libertarian financial newsletter I subscribe to which, unlike the USG and media, report Mexico&rsquo;s Drug War as a Civil War   &mdash;   and which recommends the following stock &#8216;picks&rsquo; this month:  </p>
<p>Brinks (BCO), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith &amp; Wesson (SWHC).</p>

		<p>The history of the Texas Rangers is replete with Mexican border fights.  TR usually won.  I say, fund them and let them do their magic.</p>
<p>Anon, you have a good idea, too.  Stop the welfare cold if there is a positive drug test.  Boom.  Big hit in the revenue department.</p>
<p>Likewise, tighten money export rules.  This would force cash to cross the border, and that is a fine incentive for the Texas Rangers.  I expect it would keep them in Colt Walkers.  </p>

<p>Exactly right.  And the only governments that practice such self-destructive policies are white ones.</p>
<p>The Chinese probably regard us all as fools.  Japan, too.</p>
<p>While China might have a bit of other ethnicities there, they wouldn&rsquo;t dream of holding them up as people to coo over and please.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the US is ongoing with a future that looks pretty bleak.  So many bad situations seem to be converging at the same time.</p>
<p>Stocking up on Pork &#8216;n Beans and constructing a bunker in the back yard is no longer thought of as kooky by a growing segment of the population.  Personally, I think survivalism will become the norm in the next couple of years.  People in my area are buying gold and, especially silver, since it is still within reach costwise for the average person.</p>

&#8220;3 Ranger: Several weeks ago here, you or someone else stated that the Mexican drug cartels were now so powerful and carried so much weight over the territory they control that they have essentially become alternate governments that are essentially social service agencies and have the power to conscript young men.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican government has a military consisting of about 175,000 personnel, which includes about 130,000 army troops.   Military analysts and other experts have estimated the number of cartel &#8220;soldiers&#8221; in the three deadliest cartels&hellip;.the Sinaloa, Los Zetas and Gulf&hellip;.at about 100,000, however, that figure was an estimate a couple of years ago, and I&rsquo;ve learned that, since then, they&rsquo;ve added thousands more.  Also, that total cartel &#8220;soldier&#8221; figure does not include the other two main drug groups which are the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, which have been estimated by various analysts to be anywhere from a few thousand to several thousand.</p>
<p>Los Zetas used to be the military arm of the Gulf Cartel, but they had a falling out, and are now viciously fighting each other from time to time.  Los Zetas are US military trained special forces troops who worked for the Mexican government, but defected to the Gulf Cartel.  There are also smaller drug gangs with various names, but they&rsquo;re small time players and some have come and gone after being attacked or threatened by the main groups.  </p>
<p>While the cartels have considerable influence&hellip;&hellip;which is growing also&hellip;.. with the rank and file, I&rsquo;m not aware of any  efforts they are presently involved with to conscript men as soldiers in any of the five main groups.  In fact, men are standing in line, as I understand the situation, to become a part of the drug trade.  </p>

[U.S. Says Threat of Mexican Drug Cartels Approaching &#8216;Crisis Proportions&rsquo;]</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of Mexico&rsquo;s deadliest drug cartels have reached a combined force of 100,000 foot soldiers, wreaking havoc across the country and threatening U.S. border states, the U.S. Defense Department told The Washington Times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cartels rival the Mexican army in size and have both Mexico and the U.S. in crisis mode as they deal with what they fear is a coming insurgency along the border.&#8221;<br>

		<p>One other item regarding the gang influence.  </p>
<p>Regarding Columbia and Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s assessment that the US helped rid the country of insurgents, I just want to add that there are still insurgents in Columbia and they are far from being hammered into submission, although they aren&rsquo;t as strong as they once were.</p>
<p>They are known by the acronyms FARC and ELN.  Both are Marxist groups, and both reportedly have ties to Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.</p>
<p>Too, I just want to add that in addition to the drug gangs, Mexico has a minority problem much more serious than any in the US. It&rsquo;s the indigenous Mayans in Chiapas.  They&rsquo;re an insurgency group known as the Zapatistas, led by a hooded figure known as Sub-Commandante Marcos. All the troops wear ski masks, and have bases in the mountainous area of Chiapas.  They had a 10 day uprising against the Mexican government in &#8216;94, claiming they are thought of as second class citizens and treated as dirt by Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>With ski masks on, they filed into Mexico City in 2000 or 2001, I believe it was, in an attempt to gain national support.  I don&rsquo;t recall now why the fighting stopped, but I believe it had to do with concessions being made by the government.  I&rsquo;m not sure.  I&rsquo;ll have to update myself on the existing situation.</p>
<p>I do know, however, that the group is still active, and Sub-Commandante Marcos releases his writings from time to time.  Marcos is a Marxist, but I don&rsquo;t know if he has ties to FARC, ELN or Chavez, but, knowing how Chavez is eager to support any far left groups in the entire area I&rsquo;d guess that he very well could be supplying the Zapatistas with arms and ammo.</p>
<p>As the US military analysts say, the border area is in a &#8220;crisis situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton and the far left press like to claim narcotics go into the US and guns come out of it to supply the gangs and insurgents, but the fact is that there are enough arms and ammo in Mexico, Central America, and the northern part of South America, to supply twice the insurgents and drug cartels now in existence.</p>
<p>I wish somebody like John Bolton or Frank Gafney would come out and set the record straight, because Hillary and her far left media allies blame the US for supplying arms to the south in an attempt to demonize our right to bear arms, using their usual crooked method of slowly, and incrementally, pushing to somehow restrict gun ownership in the US.</p>
<p>When they tell enough lies and feel they are finally in a position to influence gun laws, they&rsquo;ll claim they don&rsquo;t want to make US gun laws more restrictive, &#8220;but we must all do what is necessary to make our country safer.&#8221;  You know, like groping grandmothers and little children at airports instead of profiling Muslims.</p>

<p>Times have changed. We do not need a &#8220;great wall&#8221; we need law and order. Define the laws and enforce them. We do not need to build some huge barrier that costs a ton of money and disrupts wildlife, we need to use common sense, define our laws, and use weapons as necessary.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly.  The entire drug operation in both Columbia and Mexico would, at the very least, dry up to just a few small remnants.</p>
<p>Legalization is the key to stoppng the fighting and the murders, plus it would reduce US prison populations to less than half.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for legalizing, taxing, and controlling drugs and reject the argument that they would be more available to teenagers.   That&rsquo;s nonsense.  They can get anything they want right now.  </p>
<p>Part of the billions saved from legalization could go toward rehab centers, which are more effective anyway than incarceration.</p>
<p>Fewer police, fewer court cases, fewer probation officers, more prison space for the REAL bad guys, and more money in taxes for the politicians to waste.</p>
<p>But legalization will never happen, so we wil inexoribly continue on our present course of destruction.  </p>
<p>Did they learn nothing from the crime and chaos brought about by Prohibition?</p>
