<h1>82% of Drug-Zone Defendants Are Black; Lawyer Sees &#8216;Gross Disparity&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, Nov. 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the 551 prosecutions launched under the state&rsquo;s Drug-Free School Zone Act, or DFSZA, since the formation of a joint initiative by the Knoxville Police Department and the Knox County District Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to target repeat offenders, 82 percent have involved black defendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a gross disparity,&#8221; said attorney Susan Shipley, who is raising the issue in Knox County on behalf of a defendant. &#8220;The disparity we&rsquo;re seeing here is something the (U.S.) Justice Department needs to look into. This is not Memphis. There are only 9 percent (of Knoxville&rsquo;s population that are) African-American in this community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the rub, as Shipley sees it. People caught with as little as a handful of crack cocaine &#8220;rocks&#8221; in the inner city often merit probation sans a DFSZA charge.</p>
<p>But those same offenders charged with a drug-zone violation face 15 to 25 years in prison with no possibility of parole  &mdash;  a penalty harsher than that meted out to killers convicted of second-degree murder.</p>
<p>Because Knox County is comprised, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau numbers, of more than 80 percent white citizens, Shipley said she assumes the majority of the population here may not care. But, she insisted, they should.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the DFSZA, anyone caught possessing or peddling dope within 1,000 feet of a school is subject to a huge boost in punishment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>John Gill, special counsel for Knox County District Attorney General Randy Nichols, called Shipley&rsquo;s claim of racial unfairness in application of that law &#8220;bull.&#8221; Police and prosecutors, he insisted, don&rsquo;t control the demographics of the crack trade. It is crack and powder cocaine that most often form the basis of DFSZA cases.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Knoxville PD Lt. Gene] Sasscer insisted that anyone caught with drugs within 1,000 feet of a school or day care is slapped with the drug-zone enhancement regardless of race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not targeting black people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re targeting drug dealers and gang members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shipley countered that the DA&rsquo;s office is using KPD and the DFSZA to unfairly cast blacks as the city&rsquo;s primary drug sellers, despite the fact that blacks make up less than 10 percent of the city&rsquo;s population. And, she added, few if any of those cases actually involve drug deals either made to schoolchildren, on school grounds or even within view of schoolchildren.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this were white kids getting busted (under DFSZA), there would be an incredible outcry,&#8221; Shipley said.<br>

<p>So it&rsquo;s geography that is to blame   &mdash;   If you&rsquo;re in West Tennessee, then the cops have permission to pop you if you&rsquo;re black and doing something criminal.  But if you&rsquo;re black and in East Tennessee, then the cops have to leave you alone.</p>
<p><i>But those same offenders charged with a drug-zone violation face 15 to 25 years in prison with no possibility of parole &mdash; a penalty harsher than that meted out to killers convicted of second-degree murder.</i></p>
<p>AND:</p>
<p><i>Under the DFSZA, anyone caught possessing or peddling dope within 1,000 feet of a school is subject to a huge boost in punishment.</i></p>
<p>These are all laws that most members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for.  They&rsquo;re the ones who wanted the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine to begin with, a disparity they would later complain about and have reversed.</p>

		<p>Folks!  There is a simple solution.  We are long past the time when we would be able to make the nation safe for everyone.  Now white people, and sympathetic non-whites who assimilate, can barely keep their middle class neighborhoods safe to walk in at night - forget about low income areas.</p>
<p>If the police go after criminals in urban areas, of course the majority of the people nabbed will be black (or latino) because they now are the vast majority in most cities and now in some suburbs.  This can lead to calls of racism, etc.</p>
<p>I think that any crimes that happen IN the ghetto, as long as they are not really affecting middle class Americans, should stay IN the ghetto.  Let the gangbangers run around shooting each other.  Let the crack heads use their drugs.  Don&rsquo;t bother any of them - unless they try to take it OUT of the Ghetto into more civilized places.  Then put the hammer down.</p>
<p>We can also offer to move Susan Shipley and her family into the heart of the ghetto to bring &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to those all non-white areas.  She&rsquo;ll be in paradise! </p>

		<p>The above reporter, Jamie Satterfield, is a pro-black apologist for them and their crimes.  </p>
<p>Knowing her, I can say with knowledge of her past shenanigans that she very likely brought this &#8220;non-story&#8221; up herself, because she wants to create the impression that what she claims this &#8220;Shipley&#8221; says is valid.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the usual yellow journalistic liar of gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never known a more self-hating white.  I can&rsquo;t say for an absolute fact, but the way she tries to promote blacks, especially black males, I&rsquo;m fairly sure she is either married to a black or she has a black boyfriend.</p>

I am not naive nor do I deny that white people use illegal drugs.</p>
<p>I suspect the reasons white people are less likely to be arrested for drug possession, use, or distribution is that whites use illegal drugs clandestinely, in the privacy of their own homes, and are less likely to flaunt such activities or engage in activities that call attention to their use (out of control parties involving the use of guns and knives).</p>
<p>If whites are using illegal drugs at the same level as blacks but not being arrested, it may be that whites are doing so more responsibly and are not drawing attention to themselves.</p>
<p>I have seen (and reported to the police with at least three successful arrest) blacks s l o w l y walking the main street in my community (any number from one to a group up to four) and stopping white teens (and younger) during the day and bar patrons at night.  </p>
<p>On the first occasion, in broad daylight, two teens were walking north and a black man was walking south. The black man stopped the two teens and I heard the black man say, &#8216;you wanna buy some weed?&rsquo; The two teens said &#8216;yeah&rsquo; and they went with the black guy. I followed them but hung far back and I was able to see the house the black man took the two white teens. I work with a large block club and the police usually attend our meetings. I gave him the information and at the next meeting the officer told me the man was arrested for selling drugs (and he had a history in his old &#8216;east side&rsquo; community. These guys are always on the move for new, untapped markets and new customers).</p>
<p>I walk a great deal in my neighborhood and whenever I see a black man s l o w l y walking the street or just hanging around, I take a mental note (and pictures). All my hunches have turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>The two other occasions involved blacks hitting on bar patrons at night and another where a black guy was sitting out all day in front of a laundry mat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see white guys following the same pattern. If whites are selling drugs on the street, I&rsquo;m not seeing it. If I do see whites selling drugs, I will report them as well. But as I said, I&rsquo;m just not seeing it in public.</p>
<p>If there are any police officers reading this and can offer tips on spotting these guys, please let me know.</p>

<p>White men make up over 70 percent of the nations suicides (of which there are more than murder victims) and have had for a long time. I don&rsquo;t hear an incredible outcry. Similarly, over 600,000 Americans have died of AIDS. Why is it impossible to discover the racial make-up of those 600,000 AIDS victims? The powers-that-be have absolutely (and have had absolutely) no problem breaking down the racial makeup of &#8216;news AIDS cases&rsquo; all this time. Neither is their difficulty in teaching us the racial makeup of those who die of every other disease and cause in America.</p>
<p>I guess those ding-darn televangelists are right again. AIDS really is different from every other disease.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;82% of Drug-Zone Defendants Are Black; Lawyer Sees &lsquo;Gross Disparity&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is the usual black idiocy trying to shift the blame from the perps to whites, stupidly trying to indict whites and the system for black misbehavior.</p>
<p>If blacks are but 9% of the area she&rsquo;s referring to, but comprise 82% of all arrests for crime, she concludes that blacks are being discriminated against, too dense to understand that the real problem is that the authorities have a black crime wave on their hands. </p>
<p>The solution lies in curbing black crime rates, not letting them off, then whining about prejudice.</p>
<p>Personally, to shut whining, crybaby black mouths, if the crimes they commit are in the black areas, I&rsquo;d reduce the convictions and let the perps back in the black neighborhoods to ply their trade. </p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s antisocial behavior, count on blacks being disproportionately represented as perpetrators. You can double your money anytime. You can actually predict it with deadly accuracy, anytime there&rsquo;s a significant black population around.</p>
<p>Just today I stopped by a local buffet restaurant I sometimes frequent, in spite of the prominent black clientele. It&rsquo;s being remodeled, and the manager and an employee stood outside all day long explaining the situation to people who came walking up. Several whites arrived, exchanged a word or two, and went away discouraged but not really bent out of shape. As I left, a black male was standing there arguing with the manager about the restaurant being closed. Eventually, there&rsquo;d be a 911 call, handcuffs, and the usual jibbering and hollering as the cops haul him away. What is it all about?</p>

		<p>Good, then the lawyer will agree that he sees a &#8220;gross disparity&#8221; between the quality of black law school admits and the White admits, as well as in the Whites who aren&rsquo;t admitted in order to make room for unequal blacks as we &#8220;increase our much needed and enriching Diversity&#8221;.<br>

<p><br>
My understanding of the situation is the same as yours. In fact, I would take your explanation applies beyond drug dealing to all manner of black crime. If white criminals   &mdash;   whether in the drug trade or any other illegal activities   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t end up behind bars quite as often as black ones, it&rsquo;s probably because the white criminals go about their crimes in smarter ways. Many criminals   &mdash;   especially black ones   &mdash;   get caught because they did something DUMB, e.g. they dealt their drugs openly rather than discreetly. Or they boasted to their homies about their latest jewelry-store smash-and-grab or their latest carjacking. Or they returned to the scene of the crime. Or they did some other damned thing so obviously risky and potentially self-incriminating that even the Trailer Park Boys would know better. </p>
<p>Like I said: DUMB. </p>

		<p>If the shoe fits, &#8220;WEAR IT!&#8221; That too many Blacks are criminals is an inarguable reality. Inarguable, that is, if one refuses to believe the mountain of evidence pointing to the greater likelihood of drug dealers to be Blacks (or Latinos).</p>

		<p>In times past, when a man was arrested for a crime, his trade was mentioned (Example - Joe blow, carpenter killed another man in a dispute, etc.). Today, especially with blacks, there is never, ever a trade, or any other employment mentioned. They are worthless to the society, other than as inmates, supplying jail/judicial employment.</p>

<p>Mike Royko, in Chicago, did a newspaper column related somewhat to that. He was referring to a movie that featured a white pimp and prostitute. He claimed it was sheer Hollywood fantasy. If there was a white pimp in Chicago the brother&rsquo;s would have already killed him. </p>

		<p>I have zero sympathy to these dealers, black, white or whatever, but automatic 15 years for a small amount on first offense is insane. A modern equivalent of 17th century English &#8220;Bloody Code&#8221; executions for minor theft, except back then the law enforcement and juries had some sense of morality and worked around the system. Is there any morality in today&rsquo;s American police or justice officials, that we should give them this sort of devastating power?</p>

		<p> Susan Shipley should move her family into the absolute worst black part of town, her children be sent to the local school and she should be forced to live there for aminimum of two years. Then she will have earned the right to say these kind of things.These liberal whites open their mouths and spit out garbage and lies without experiencing the people she is so staunchly defending.They go home to their walled communities with armed guards at the gate and send their children to private schools which are also heavily guarded.All the while never coming close to any of them for fear of their own personal safety. <br>
 The liberal elites of this country continually bring in more third world refugees to assauge their feelings of guilt and then dump them on the &#8220;unwashed masses&#8221; to feed, clothe, educate and tolerate their crime, customs and language. A lot of them then get into the drug trade because of easy money to be made.<br>
