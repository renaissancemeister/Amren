<h1><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_16657676?nclick_check=1">Employee Charged with Creating, Selling Social Security Cards</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Goldston, San Jose Mercury News, Nov. 19, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 29-year employee of the U.S. Social Security Administration office in San Jose has been indicted for illegally creating and selling Social Security cards.</p>
<p>Rachel Ochoa, 66, of San Jose, was arrested at her office in San Jose last week and appeared briefly in federal court before being released on $50,000 bail.</p>
<p>According to the indictment by a federal grand jury, Ochoa was able to use her position at the San Jose office of the Social Security Administration to falsely create cards for people. Recipients of the cards paid from $2,500 to $5,000 to obtain the cards, according to an affidavit by the FBI.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities declined to say how many cards were involved but the charges against Ochoa stem from Nov. 18, 2005 to Nov. 9 this year. </p>

		<p>I work around A LOT of latinos.  They will do anything for a social security card.  I feel bad for them when such cards are mentioned, because they get deep looks of longing and desperation on their faces.  It&rsquo;s the magic card that opens the world to them.  Too bad they didn&rsquo;t wait in line like legal immigrants and get one through the proper channels.  Most illegal Latinos I know are flagrant lawbreakers who will tell any lie or break any law with impunity to get ahead.  I guess they feel they have to, but it is ruining our nation.  I have so many stories to tell&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Hopefully, this criminal and many like him will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of whatever laws we still adhere to.<br>
There should be one or two laws that California still observes&hellip;&hellip;..  Will we have to follow laws when the hispanics take over?</p>

		<p>So who doesn&rsquo;t know that this goes on all the time? Same with &#8220;hispanics&#8221; who work at DMV issuing drivers license to illegal mexicans. </p>
<p>These are supposedly LEGAL mexican Americans who work in these places and they claim to &#8220;love&#8221; America to our faces and then rip us off behind our backs. Hope the person gets alot of jail time for this,plus restitution, but it is doubtful if that ever happens.</p>
<p> We cannot allow ANY minority to work where they can commit fraud and give their own races &#8220;a hand up&#8221;. Better yet, get them all out of our country and we wouldn&rsquo;t be having any of these problems to begin with.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, $50k bail, $2.5k - $5k per card X unknown quantity of cards X 5 years of doing this adds up to a former SS employee jumping bail &amp; retiring in Mexico. I wonder how many SS checks she will receive in Mexico, in addtion to the pile she made ripping off the system. I can&rsquo;t imagine the US government crossing an international border to capture a poor white-collar Mexican criminal, probably would be considered racist by our AG Eric Holder. </p>

<p>Your post makes no sense. You say you feel bad for them because they so want a social security card?  WHY do you feel bad for them? Come on! I so want them all out of my country!</p>
<p>Why is it too bad they didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t get in line and become legal, you ask?  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to EVER become legal and that goes for all the rest of the 3rd worlders here. That was the first mistake our people ever made was to bring in these people and then to legalize them. We are way past that slippery slope, due to the misguided altruism of some very misguided White people. Please don&rsquo;t allow yourself to become like them  </p>

		<p>I feel that all government jobs, federal, state, county and municipal, including elected, appointed and civil service positions, should only be held by native-born citizens.  Not legal residents, not even naturalized citizens for the simple fact that divided loyalties means no loyalaty.  And if the immigrants who come here enrich our economy why do they need government jobs to begin with?  NJ government is flooded with foreign born hispanics and indians.  A true disgrace.</p>

		<p>The problem is that many of these &#8220;legal Americans&#8221; of Hispanic decent are anchor babies, who sympathize with illegal invaders and are sour at this country for not caving into the demands of citizenship being made by their brethren. So they get back at this country by ripping off Americans and enriching their pocket books by helping their illegal invading raza with fraudulent driver&rsquo;s licenses and social security cards.</p>

		<p>Things are so bad in &#8220;da feddle gubmint&#8221; that even a cynical bloke like me are surprized.  I got a federal job in Arizona based on my education (undergraduate degree from ASU) and my veteran status. I was surrounded by Hispanics and Blacks with little formal education that held the same pay grade (GS-9) The garbage that they get away with is unbeleivable.  White, qualified workers are organized into what are called &#8220;Tiger teams&#8221; to clean up the mess that these blacks and Hispanics leave in their wake. Fraud is common (think &#8220;ghost accounts&#8221;) among the Hispanics, outright theft and not showing up for work is the Black&rsquo;s specialty.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the point of a Social Security network that is entirely compromised both by &#8216;sellout&rsquo; and by refusal to clear the dead from the accounts?</p>
<p>How many BILLIONS of dollars go to people who don&rsquo;t exist?  How many people even -know- that there are more than one person on their number?  I sure didn&rsquo;t.</p>

Comment 1 Jay wrote &#8221; I feel bad for them when such cards are mentioned, because they get deep looks of longing and desperation on their faces.&#8221; . <br>
It is sentiments like yours that prove there is no hope for America. YOU ARE SORRY FOR THEM ? Jay, those looks of longing are not for a card, THEY ARE LOOKS OF LONGING FOR YOUR COUNTRY. The moment they get that card, then they ask for a car, then a house, then free medicare, tuition, seats in the house, whole states as reconquista and finally, a whole country. Remember the poem <br>
&#8220;For want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse the soldier was lost, for want of a soldier the army was lost for want of an army the kingdom was lost and all for the want of a horse shoe nail! &#8221; <br>
In this case, from a card (instead of a horse shoe nail)and the likes of Jay who &#8216;feel sorry&rsquo; the Country will surely be lost. You try getting a card like that in Mexico and see if anyone will &#8216;feel sorry&rsquo; for you!</p>
