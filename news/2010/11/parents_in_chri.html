<h1>Parents in Christian-Newsom Murders Want More Prosecution for Boyd</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hannah Kim, WATE-TV (Knoxville), Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The parents of murder victims Channon Christian and Chris Newsom will always hold on to the memories of their children, but they&rsquo;re also seeking more justice in court.</p>
<p>The couple was carjacked at gunpoint, robbed, tortured, raped and killed in January 2007.</p>
<p>Christian, a 5&rsquo;7&#8221; student at the University of Tennessee, was bound, put in garbage bags and stuffed in a trash can where she suffocated.</p>
<p>Newsom was bound, taken to a set of railroad tracks, shot three times and then set on fire.</p>
<p>Both wound up nearly unrecognizable on autopsy tables.</p>
<p>The randomness of the torture slayings evoked fear and disbelief from authorities and the community.</p>
<p>A massive investigation eventually brought four defendants to trial. Vanessa Coleman was sentenced to 53 years on lesser charges in the case.</p>
<p>Coleman&rsquo;s boyfriend, Letalvis Cobbins, and his friend, George Thomas, will spend the rest of their lives in prison.</p>
<p>And Cobbins&rsquo; half-brother, LeMaricus Davidson, received the death penalty.</p>
<p>Still the parents of the victims say they have unfinished business.</p>
<p>&#8220;They kept saying Davidson was the ringleader. Well he may have been the ringleader, but he wasn&rsquo;t the most evil of them all. He may have been the ringleader, but he did everything Eric Boyd said,&#8221; Deena and Gary Christian said.</p>
<p>Boyd is serving an 18 year prison sentence in this case. He was convicted in federal court as an accessory after the fact for helping Davidson hide from authorities.</p>
<p>However, Boyd was never charged with rape or murder. &#8220;I will always feel like Boyd is getting away with murder,&#8221; said Chris&rsquo; mother, Mary Newsom.</p>
<p>Cobbins told investigators it was Boyd and Davidson who launched the crime spree that started with the couple&rsquo;s carjacking.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the defendants insinuated that Boyd was the one to first take Chris Newsom away after the carjacking. They said he returned a short time later without Newsom to Davidson&rsquo;s rental home on Chipman Street, where Christian was held captive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figured when he came back without him you know that he went ahead and did something with the old boy,&#8221; George Thomas told investigators in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t know if Chris felt the bullet, but he damn well felt what they did to him,&#8221; Gary Christian said. &#8220;I think Thomas shot him in the back and Eric Boyd shot him in the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never told me he did any of that. He never told me he was involved in any of that,&#8221; said Boyd&rsquo;s attorney, Phil Lomonaco, during a recent interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even with all the accounts implicating Boyd, the Knox County District Attorney General&rsquo;s Office by law can&rsquo;t use the incriminating statements made to investigators by the other convicted killers, even if they did prosecute Boyd.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel like Chris got full justice,&#8221; said his father, Hugh Newsom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Christians say the other convicted killers may not have been motivated by race, but they believe Boyd was. &#8220;Eric Boyd did what he did because he hated white people,&#8221; Gary said.</p>
<p>When asked if he feels this was a hate crime on the part of Eric Boyd, Hugh Newsom said, &#8220;Yes, absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyd is being held at a medium security prison in West Virginia with 12 years of his 18 year sentence still to serve. He&rsquo;s due to be released in 2022.</p>
<p>Boyd&rsquo;s federal conviction in this case is under appeal.<br/>

		<p>In the place of the parents of these innocent people murdered by murderous racist blacks, I would want them prosecuted for hate crimes and then to swing from ropes around their necks. Otherwise, I would be seeking revenge against all of them. That is &#8220;full justice&#8221; for all of them. If an home invader can be charged for the death of an accomplice at the hands of a home owner plus the home invasion, then all of these monsters can be prosecuted and then executed for this racially motivated murder and atrocity against the white race.</p>

		<p>This was one of the most horrible, vicious crimes that could be committed. Two young people lost their lives to these worthless non-humans and all should have gotten the death penalty. Some bleeding heart judge will come along and let them go shortly, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

		<p>I hope that someday the proper revenge will be taken on liberals who have allowed this kind of situation to exist in the first place.  We must return to some type of segregation, or separation, or sucession, or something to avoid white wholesale slaughter in the not too distant future.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Father of Knoxville Horror victim: &ldquo;Eric Boyd did what he did because he hated white people.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well, well, well.  A relative of the victim of an evil black perp is finally standing up and telling it like it is instead of saying something stupid like he/she feels sorry for the families of the black thugs.</p>
<p>But note that he doesn&rsquo;t think the other blacks were motivated by a hatred of whites, in spite of the outrageous atrocity of the crimes, unequivocally indicating deep feelings of rage and hatred.  The poor fool still is ignorant of how much anti-white hatred is out there.  Really disgusting.</p>
<p>The prosecution and police did their level best to try to cover up any racial hatred by the blacks, as if the brutality of the crime wasn&rsquo;t enough of an indicator of racial animus.  Remember the prosecutor who criticized white comments on the internet about the crimes as he declared there wasn&rsquo;t any evidence of white hatred, showing his abject stupidity at not knowing that such brutality would not have occurred if the victims had been black.  In fact the crime itself probably would never had occurred if the victims had been white.  The torture slayings were just additional evidence of white hatred.</p>
<p>Regarding the other authorities, too often these judicial and prosecutorial dregs are as bad as the criminals themselves in these racial cases.  If this Boyd were white and his victims black, rest assured they would have bent over backwards to pin some kind of hate charges on him. </p>
<p>FAR too often nowadays whites are caught between the crimes of black perps and those of law inforcement and the judicial system who seem to think their number one job is to do everything possible to show they aren&rsquo;t racist.  They&rsquo;re nothing if they aren&rsquo;t disgusting.<br/>

		<p>Sadly for White Humanity, it takes a grieving White Father to tell the truth about hateful and violent blacks. Unfortunately, the didn&rsquo;t go far enough and connect the hate to rap music, civil rights agitators, and anti white Affirmative Action, and hate crime Diversity.</p>
<p>The Left would have instantly connected the crime to &#8220;extremist rhetoric that creates a climate of potential violence&#8221;.</p>

		<p>None of those evil animals need to continue breathing the same air as the rest of us. </p>
<p>Gary and Deena,<br/>
Continue the fight as is Maureen Faulkner. When you lose a loved one in such a horrible way and with no motive other than the fact that they were White, the only justice is in the death of every one of those vile beasts. Anyone who participated in any way should die. They all knew what the fate of Channon and Christopher would be, therefore they were just as culpable as the ones who actually committed those atrocities against them.<br/>
Hate crime? What else could you possible call such unspeakable acts; especially involving such horrendous sexual brutality? <br/>
They need to die- every one of them including the sows who enabled them. There is neither forgiveness nor redemption for these sub-humans. The earth needs to be cleansed of their existence. Channon and Christopher are two more victims to add to the score that very soon is going to be settled.<br/>

		<p> 0In a rightous world they would have all been executed. I however disagree with hate crime extensions for the simple reason that it requires you to read the villains mind. Juries have the right to sentence as they see fit and surely would take motive into account when sentencing. We have to be fair.</p>

		<p>Obviously these criminals are not human. Humans do not treat other humans that way. I personally think that they should be tortured for a few days, like their victims,  and then shot dead with a gun. But ofcourse, the &#8220;law&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t allow that kind of justice. </p>
<p>Anything less than death is a joke tho. They should all be put to death. They are beyond redemption with such an evil crime. Justice demands death, the victims deserve for their killers to die, and so do the victim&rsquo;s families. </p>

		<p>I have not met one single White person, including my own family members, who have ever heard of this crime or about the Carr brothers and their torture of 5 Whites in Wichita. Not to mention ever hearing about the thousands of crimes blacks have perpetrated against Whites in this country. Why is that do you think? It is a deliberate attempt by our media and the powers that be to cover up all such crimes, through omission.  Oh, they will report a FEW cases, but never in a million years will they alarm White America to the facts and the truths of black on White crime. </p>

		<p>In the initial police interrogations of the perps and members of their social circle, I believe it was Daphne Sutton, the white girlfriend of ringleader Lemaricus Davidson, who said that Eric Boyd was a &#8220;muslim&#8221; and &#8220;didn&rsquo;t like whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, there were indications&hellip;I&#8221;m sorry I can&rsquo;t remember what they were now&hellip;.that some of the perps were members of The Black Gangster Disciples gang.</p>
<p>These and many other questions played around the periphery of the trials, but no news source ever did ANY investigative reporting on any of them, I believe. (Of course there&rsquo;s not a lot of investigative reporting done on anything anymore anyway).</p>
<p>Knoxville&rsquo;s newspaper, the Knoxville News Sentinel, did a pretty good job of covering the trials, and even got some court documents released that would not have been released without the newspaper&rsquo;s efforts, but the paper did no investigative reporting at all. </p>
<p>And there were so many unanswered questions: strange and seemingly unbelievable testimony that appeared aimed at linking victims and perps before the crime; a brief phone conversation between victim Channon Christian and her father on the night of the carjacking after the carjacking had occurred (he detected no alarm in her voice&hellip;my guess is that she was in middle-class shock and was just robot-like trying to reassure him, but it&rsquo;s still a very strange loose end), and a few other anomalies I can&rsquo;t recall now. Nothing that seemed to me likely to be terribly important, but on the other hand anomalies sometimes turn out to be the key to important understandings. </p>
<p>More depressing to me was that there was no investigative journalism concerning the milieu from which these perps sprang. They seemed such normal thugs, selling dope, and hanging out with their girlfriends who fixed breakfast for them. A description of life in the house the victims were taken to and tortured in seemed to lack only children playing in the backyard to be a picture of peaceful thug domesticity. </p>
<p>The crimes were committed obviously without any planning or mental presence. It seems clear from testimony that the perps were stoned on the drug know as &#8220;angel dust&#8221; in my day, and &#8220;embalming fluid&#8221; in the present day&hellip;a drug that I saw turn peaceful persons violent in the 60s&hellip;it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine, I guess, the effect it would have on low-IQ black thugs with the customary chip on their shoulder about whites.</p>
<p>A point I tried to always note in my posts at the newspaper&rsquo;s site, and which more often than not got my posts removed if I made the point clearly, was that if our society were still segregated, this crime could not have happened. Under segregation, victim Channon Christian would not have been visiting her white girlfriend, and ringleader Lemaricus Davidson visiting his black lady &#8220;friend&#8221; (drug client), at the same apt. complex, an apt. complex in which both the friend of Channon and the friend of Davidson were resident, and in the parking lot of which the carjacking took place on an evening that Channon and Davidson were both there to visit their respective friends). Under segregation, a nice middle-class young white woman and the black drug client of a convicted black criminal would not have been living in the same apt. complex.</p>

<p>The Knoxville paper has also done some decent follow ups with another big time incident of black crime that we&rsquo;re supposed to have forgotten about by now:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/26vu8pn</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much sickening weasel stuff in this that I don&rsquo;t even want to break it all down.  I will say that if the state prosecutors in Knoxville and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office at Knoxville had been doing their proper jobs in response to the February 2004 gun incident, he would still be in prison for that instead of out to murder military recruiters in the name of Islam and Jihad.  And notice how quickly one Brian Levin of Cal State - San Bernardino circled the wagons around Islam, even though this creep had explicit plans to murder Jewish clergy in TN and AR.  The former Mr. Bledsoe is right when he says that the FBI and Federal law enforcement isn&rsquo;t as competent as they&rsquo;d like us to think.</p>

Hollywood is just as bad, I have boycotted everything that makes the white race look like morons. Just look at all advertising and TV shows; noble blacks in power in politics, hospitals and police departments and whites are nerdy uncordinated geeks or criminals.

		<p>There was some nationwide coverage of this story.  But the coverage was about the Neo-Nazis who picketed and created negative exposure from the start.  I think that caused the nationwide blackout.  It was too unpopular.  Whites ought to recognize what works and doesn&rsquo;t work in this and similar situations.  Nazis don&rsquo;t work.  </p>
<p>I recall at the time the parents of both victims saying that regardless of the murder of their children, they did not condone &#8220;racist&#8221; reaction, and that their children/vitims would not have wished that to be the product of their murders.  I wonder if their and views have modified since then.</p>

<p><br/>
You&rsquo;re right.  The Nazis got all the coverage, such as there was.  The media absolutely LOVE Nazis   &mdash;   Hollywood Nazis, that is.  Conspicuous, ridiculous Nazis   &mdash;  - they&rsquo;re colorful, controversial, photographic, guaranteed to get attention, and easy to hate. In a country where &#8220;hate&#8221; is banned against anyone, nazis are an exception.  Furthermore, they bring in money.</p>
<p>Ordinary white people staging a protest are uninteresting.  Who cares?  Not the media!  But everyone loves to hate nazis. And they&rsquo;re good to furnish a moral lesson. Schools and editorials can then provide us with some Holocaust instruction and remind us of our white guilt, all our sins against the world&rsquo;s minorities.  What would Hollywood and the media do without their nazis to scare us all into a panicky nazi-phobia?  Even better, they scare wealthy old people to open their check books and send contributions to the SPLC and such.  There&rsquo;s nothing like strutting Hollywood nazis to losen up those wallets and checkbooks!  What would the media do without their nazis?</p>
