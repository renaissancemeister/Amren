			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ndtv.com, Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twenty six year old Simran Preet Singh Lamba became the first enlisted Sikh soldier in the US army in more two decades to complete basic training without shedding his turban and other articles of faith.</p>
<p>Recruited by the Army in 2009 through the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) programme for his language skills in Punjabi and Hindi, Lamba completed basic training with his turban and unshorn hair at Fort Jackson outside Columbia and became a US citizen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Present US Army policy still excludes Sikhs who maintain their turban and beard. Sikhs in the US military may maintain their religiously-mandated turban and unshorn hair only if they receive an individual exemption to do so.</p>
<p>Lamba was initially told that his Sikh articles of faith would likely be accommodated.</p>
<p>But, in March 2010, his formal request for a religious accommodation was denied. Lamba appealed the decision, and his appeal was accepted in September 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He wore a helmet over a small turban during field exercises. During gas mask exercises, he successfully created a seal. He also enjoyed deep bonds with fellow soldiers and his superiors.</p>
<p>In 1981, the Army banned &#8220;conspicuous&#8221; religious articles of faith, including turbans and unshorn hair, for its service members. The ban was enacted despite a long history of Sikhs serving in the US military with their religious identity intact.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the past year has seen welcome progress in the campaign to restore Sikh service in the US military.</p>
<p>In March, Captain Tejdeep Singh Rattan, a dentist, became the first Sikh commissioned officer to complete basic training in more than two decades.</p>
<p> In September, Captain Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, a physician, became the second Sikh commissioned officer to complete basic training.</p>
<p>The addition of Lamba to the group of Sikh military graduates is a critical step forward in proving that Sikhs can successfully serve in the US military. </p>
<p>&#8220;To be an American is to be able to serve his or her country in the defence of the justice and equality we all enjoy as citizens. We appreciate the US Army&rsquo;s willingness to consider the overwhelmingly positive experiences of Captains Rattan and Kalsi  &mdash;  as well as the success of dozens of Sikhs who have served in the US. Armed Forces over the past century  &mdash;  in giving Mr Lamba the opportunity to serve the United States,&#8221; said Amandeep Singh Sidhu lead counsel for McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that his success in enlisted basic training continues to dispel misconceptions about the ability of a Sikh solider to conform to the Army&rsquo;s standards for neat and conservative uniformity, safety, military readiness, and unit cohesion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sikh soldiers served in the US Army as far back as World War I. Thousands of Sikh soldiers helped liberate France in WWII. Today, Sikhs serve in the militaries of England, Canada, India and Austria, among others, often alongside American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I really have a problem with it, that is if they are here they could and should serve. Sikhs have a positive fighting record with the British and on their own. Some at least also want to fight unlike many (not all) East Asian (so-called hyphenated) Americans.</p>

		<p>Insane!  Yep, let&rsquo;s just keep bringing in all these Indians, and assorted nonwhites to fill the ranks in OUR military&hellip;.anybody else have a sneaking suspicion that this is going as planned? Fill our military, police force with nonwhite &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and it will be so much easier for them to round up us Whites when the time comes. NONE of them have any loyalty to Whites or to America and I don&rsquo;t care what they say.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a large contingent of military hacks at the Pentagon who are nothing but radical leftist politicians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing a nice job of reducing the effectiveness of the US military.</p>
<p>At some point the military is going to meet head on with a catastrophe, because of their sick infatuaion with political correctness.</p>
<p>I would advise any white kid to stay away from the military.  It&rsquo;s a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why the leaders of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Western Europe want their own people exterminated?  Do the &#8216;elites&rsquo; think that they will remain on top once the browns take over?  Why this rush to desroy your own people?  Can anyone explain it?</p>

<p>Nor should we.  At least not to liberal whites.  Each of us should seek out like minded people and band with them.  We need our own country, or to watch Europe closely.  If any European country is successful is ejecting the non-whites, we should all migrate there.  America is lost.<br>

<p>Did not Rome fall because of letting the barbarians inside their gates to join their military and do their work? How come no talk show host ever talks about this and shows the comparison as to what all White nations are doing now? Come on, Beck, Hannity, Rush, Levin, where is YOUR courage and loyalty to White America?  Obviously you have NONE! Zilch!</p>

		<p>Sikhs are really magnificent people, and highly reliable soldiers, who were known for their loyalty and bravery.  The British had Sikh regiments everywhere in the Empire and they earned the highest number of VCs in WW1 on the Western Front.  They did not participate in the 1857 Indian Mutiny, but actually served to surpress it.  They are NOT obnoxious because they do not prosletize.  This is a good example of the need for white conservative race realists to make sure they are educated when they talk or write about groups that are less well known to us, lest we make fools of ourselves.</p>
<p>If preserving our race is important, than so is preserving all races and ethnic groups.  We cannot expect something for ourselves that we are not willing to allow others.  Multiculturalism OUGHT to mean that we support the existence of all these cultures, especially worthy ones like the Sikhs of India.  This makes our demand for preservation and place legitimate.  It also creates the opportunity to point out to more that &#8220;Diversity&#8221; today really means NO eventual cultural distinction, with dominance going to the lest cooperative.  Whites have to become non-cooperative with those forces who drive the &#8220;Diversity&#8221; myth.</p>

		<p>These sorts of &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo; to the uniform are a slippery slope that will eventually end up with some soldiers wearing muslim garb while Christians will still have to conceal their cross under their T-shirt.</p>
<p>Making religion based exceptions to uniform regulations doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a good idea. What would have happened if the Army just said, &#8220;no.&#8221; </p>
<p>Cultural correctness, or protecting soldiers?</p>
<p>God bless the Sikhs! They are indeed a great people, with a great history. They are our allies. </p>

<p>Yes, the program did exist in WWII, not sure what Gen. Patton&rsquo;s use of those recruits though. People of other countries can be trusted if they are from Western, basically Christian countries but muslims cannot be trusted from ANY country and the Indian hindu and any other religions HATE the muslims so an enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p>

		<p>I have some knowledge of the Sikh. They are great soldiers; I would be happy have them fighting beside me as allies against a common enemy. I do not want them colonizing my country, or (if America were a normal country) serving in its military. However, considering the diversified and liberalized state of the federal government&rsquo;s military, Sikh presence probably doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

		<p>For those of us readers here who don&rsquo;t know much about Sikhs, here&rsquo;s a quick snapshot: </p>
<p>&#8220;By the advent of World War I, Sikhs in the British Indian Army totaled over 100,000, i.e. 20% of the British Indian Army. In the years to 1945, 14 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the Sikhs, a per capita record given the size of the Sikh Regiments.[61] In 2002, the names of all Sikh VC and George Cross winners were inscribed on the pavilion monument of the Memorial Gates[81] on Constitution Hill next to Buckingham palace, London.[82] Lieutenant Colonel Chanan Singh Dhillon was instrumental in campaigning for the memorial building.</p>
<p>During World War I, Sikh battalions fought in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Gallipoli and France. Six battalions of the Sikh Regiment were raised in World War II, and served at El Alamein and in Burma, Italy and Iraq, winning 27 battle honours.</p>
<p>Across the world, Sikhs are commemorated in Commonwealth cemeteries.[83]</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last two world wars 83,005 turban wearing Sikh soldiers were killed and 109,045 were wounded. They all died or were wounded for the freedom of Britain and the world, and during shell fire, with no other protection but the turban, the symbol of their faith.&#8221;<br>
 &mdash; General Sir Frank Messervy[84]</p>
<p>&#8220;British people are highly indebted and obliged to Sikhs for a long time. I know that within this century we needed their help twice [in two world wars] and they did help us very well. As a result of their timely help, we are today able to live with honour, dignity, and independence. In the war, they fought and died for us, wearing the turbans.&#8221;<br>

<p> We don&rsquo;t have to preserve other races to be &#8220;legitmate&#8221; as you claim! WE preserve OUR race, period! WE ARE THE WORTHY ONES, not the Sikhs! </p>

<p>The U.S. Army had tons of American recruits named &#8220;Miller&#8221; and &#8220;Schmidt.&#8221;  Why would it need any special recruiting programs?  More importantly, did any of these German speakers get special treatment over the other recruits?</p>
<p>Mexicans are Christians too, but they enlist in our army to get FREE military training then use that training to kill our border patrol agents.</p>
<p>***<br>
&#8220;The British had Sikh regiments everywhere in the Empire&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, they were the loyal lapdogs of the British Empire, the very same British Empire our forefathers fought AGAINST.</p>
<p>The Army, Inc. is a multinational corporation that wishes to set up a major base in India, much like its bases in Germany and South Korea.  Sikhs are loyal to globalization (the current incarnation of the British Empire), not the United States of America.  I don&rsquo;t understand why you praise Sikhs, unless of course you&rsquo;re one of them&hellip;or someone who wants to surrender the United States back to the British Empire.<br>

		<p>Why all this praising of Sikhs? I don&rsquo;t see how there migrating to White countries is good for Whites at all. Let them have an independent state for themselves in the Punjab if they want, but I don&rsquo;t see how there being in my country is something I should feel thrilled about at all.</p>

That is all of the story.  America is playing a historical song that is in perfect tune. However, Rome at least took some several hundred years to fall as a result of its stupidity.  We are on course to destroy our country and the grande experiment in record time.  Sigh.</p>
