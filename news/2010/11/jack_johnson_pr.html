			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Schwartzman, Ruben Castaneda and Cheryl W. Thompson, Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just after 10:12 a.m. Friday, Leslie Johnson frantically phoned her husband, Jack B. Johnson, the Prince George&rsquo;s county executive. </p>
<p>Two FBI agents were at the front door of their two-story brick colonial in Mitchellville. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t answer it,&#8221; the county executive said, unaware that more agents were listening in. </p>
<p>Johnson ordered his wife to find and destroy a $100,000 check from a real estate developer that was hidden in a box of liquor. </p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to put it down the toilet?&#8221; Leslie Johnson asked. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, flush that,&#8221; the county executive said. </p>
<p>But what about the cash? she asked   &mdash;   $79,600. </p>
<p>Put it in your underwear, the county executive told his wife. </p>
<p>She replied, &#8220;I have it in my bra&#8221;   &mdash;   which is where agents discovered the money after she answered the door. </p>
<p>That conversation, as documented in an FBI affidavit, led to the arrest Friday of Jack Johnson and his wife. Each was charged with evidence tampering and destroying evidence in a case the U.S. attorney called the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; in a broader corruption investigation in Prince George&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Appearing Friday night outside the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Johnson vowed to fight. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m innocent of these charges,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just can&rsquo;t wait for the facts to come out. When they come out, I&rsquo;m absolutely convinced I&rsquo;ll be vindicated.&#8221; </p>
<p>Johnson, 61, is in the waning days of his second term in office. His administration has been the target of allegations of cronyism and corruption since his 2002 election. He was silent as FBI agents led him and his wife separately from their home about 1 p.m. Johnson, the county&rsquo;s former chief prosecutor, wore a suit jacket on his shoulders, concealing his handcuffs. </p>
<p>Leslie Johnson, 58, who earlier this month won election to the Prince George&rsquo;s County Council, held a blue coat up over her face as an agent escorted her to a waiting sedan. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Johnsons&rsquo; arrests grew out of a four-year FBI investigation into developers and their associates &#8220;regularly providing things of value to public officials&#8221; in exchange for official favors, according to a 10-page affidavit filed with the criminal complaint. </p>
<p>The investigation centered on alleged bribes Jack Johnson took in exchange for helping an unidentified developer seek grant money from a federal affordable-housing program administered by the county&rsquo;s Department of Housing and Community Development. </p>
<p>The developer gave Johnson cash and checks as far back as 2007, including one for $100,000, according to the affidavit. More recently, on Nov. 5, in what appears to be part of a sting, the developer gave Johnson $5,000 in cash in a transaction that investigators recorded. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As agents descended on Johnson&rsquo;s home, federal investigators from the FBI and IRS also were executing search warrants at the Upper Marlboro headquarters of the Prince George&rsquo;s County government. </p>
<p>At least 12 warrants were served around the county, law enforcement sources said. Karen Campbell, a spokeswoman for the County Council, said she was unaware of any search warrants served at council members&rsquo; homes or offices. </p>
<p>The arrests stunned Maryland&rsquo;s political world, in which Jack Johnson has been a player for a generation. Maryland Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley (D) described it as a &#8220;sad day for Prince George&rsquo;s County and for County Executive Johnson and his family.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since taking office in 2002, Johnson has been criticized for doling out government contracts to friends and allies who were not qualified for the work and for running up excessive charges on his county-issued credit card. In 2008, federal agents investigating a real estate development in Greenbelt searched the offices of two of Johnson&rsquo;s senior advisers, as well as a campaign contributor. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson, a native of South Carolina who served as the county&rsquo;s state&rsquo;s attorney before becoming executive, personified Prince George&rsquo;s evolution from a majority-white suburb to a symbol of African American success. Johnson and his wife, the parents of three adult children, appeared on the cover of the New York Times magazine in 1992 for an article, titled &#8220;The New Black Suburbs,&#8221; that focused on the migration of affluent African Americans from the District to Prince George&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Johnson served as deputy state&rsquo;s attorney for two terms before winning election as Prince George&rsquo;s top prosecutor in 1994. Over the course of two terms as prosecutor, Johnson became a near-ubiquitous presence around the county, showing up at block parties and backyard barbecues, all the while laying a grass-roots groundwork for his successful campaign for county executive in 2002. </p>
<p>His near-constant criticism of Prince George&rsquo;s police department helped make him popular in the county&rsquo;s poor and working-class neighborhoods. </p>
<p>As county executive, he became known for raising Prince George&rsquo;s Wall Street bond rating and for seeking to improve its image with the slogan, &#8220;Gorgeous Prince George&rsquo;s.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It was reported on the news a couple of hours ago that they also arrested a few PG county police officers on the same charges. The Prince George&rsquo;s police have had a pretty bad reputation for awhile. I think corruption runs deep in MD. and most other stubbornly liberal states in the northeast.</p>

		<p>Black politicians sure do know how to hide rotten money   &mdash;   First it was William Jefferson (D-LA), hiding cash in his freezer.  Hence his new nickname &#8220;Cold Cash.&#8221;  Now it&rsquo;s this one putting almost $80G worth of money in her bra   &mdash;   Like that wasn&rsquo;t going to show.  Ironically, BRA is also an acronym for &#8220;Black Run America&#8221; on certain websites that AR readers also read, so the verbal irony is too pleasing.</p>
<p>I understand that Prince Georges County is where many D.C. blacks are being encouraged to move to, in order to get out of D.C. to make life safe for white liberal yuppie gentrification in the District.</p>
<p>I do know that Sam Francis lived in PG for most of the time he lived in the D.C. area, including his last years.  He told me when he first bought in PG CO, the real estate was only somewhat expensive, and the neighborhoods were livable.  But year after year, he watched street after street fall and regress.  His neighborhood was almost pure ghetto, he told me a few months before he passed.</p>

		<p>Having grown up in and consequently fled Prince George&rsquo;s County, my views of the transformation of the county are not so sanguinary.  The school busing order by Judge Kaufmann in 1972 got the ball rolling, introducing chaos into what had been decent schools for white children.  The white exodus intensified as blacks from the District of Columbia flooded the county in the 80s and 90s.  Finally, the white-run, but liberal, county government was toppled by a wave of black politicians, including the first black county executive, Donald Curry, and the first District Attorney, Jack Johnson.  Curry had been cultivated for years by the white developer class and has proved smart enough to become wealthy without crude shakedowns.  Johnson proved otherwise.  Elected originally as a man who would keep the majority-white PG county cops in line, Jackson has apparently lined his pockets with developer bribes.  </p>
<p>And for Prince George&rsquo;s County.  The county is 25 % white and most of these are old.  The county regularly has 100+ murders each year and crime is high.  Inside-the-beltway neighborhoods are indistinguishable from DC neighborhoods.  Because so many blacks in PG County work for some sort of government, there is affluence.  Yet it remains a dingy, crime-ridden county with terrible schools, not a nice place to raise children, especially if they are white.</p>

		<p>Why &#8220;once hailed?&#8221;  I&rsquo;m sure it still is.  He&rsquo;s playing the game exactly according to script.  </p>
<p>Get to the top, steal all you can, and if caught, become a martyr by playing the race card, pay minimal penalties, become a hero to blacks, win humanitarian awards from civil rights organizations, get a plum job in a White Money funded think tank, etc.</p>
<p>Even when blacks are paying for their crimes, they are making an investment in more shaking down Whitey.</p>

		<p>A most important case. The most affluent black county in America. Yet a lousy school system filled with blacks and many illegals, which Johnson turned a deaf ear to. Massive huge homes, well-overpriced, in the middle of the FNMA overpriced mortgage crisis. A county that whines it doesn&rsquo;t have Nordstrom or nice stores. Of course the one decent shopping center it has is dying from muggings, shootings and youth going wild. This is SO unexpected.</p>

		<p>A White Man from New Orleans, who had fled to Tennessee, explained their blacks to me.  He said they only get into trouble when they become Kings and forget to keep spreading the loot around.  When they keep too much for themselves, they get taken down by snitches, who then either have their shot at the top or place a crony in position with a proper warning to keep the goodies coming.</p>
<p>This Jackson obviously kept too much for himself and the FBI got a tip from one of his former supporters.<br>

<p>When the blacks are fighting against White Humanity, they always put their own internal squabbles aside and attack us with a unified front, and they even welcome their enemies, the illegal aliens and other assorted parasitic non whites, into their ranks.</p>
<p>But as soon as they win their latest victory against evil, unearned White Privilege, they start fighting each other over stuff and turf.</p>
<p>Vicious anti white hatemonger Cynthia Tucker is now attacking one of her own for making too much money from a HBCU.</p>
<p>Paying a &#8220;distinguished&#8221; black $1,000,000 offends Ms. Tucker, probably because he forgot to share some of it with whatever civil rights organization upon whose board she sits, or some civil rights organization that wants to give her an &#8220;african american service and achievement award&#8221; plus cash honoraria, but can&rsquo;t for lack of funds.</p>
<p>One thing we can count on in blacks is their raging resentment of other blacks who act White and get rich doing it.</p>

		<p>Yeah, Bowie MD in Prince George&rsquo;s county was the last remaining white hold out. But ofcourse, as usual, the black invaders came in and ruined it for the white people. It was bound to happen, the only remaining white area surrounded by the natives. </p>
<p>Whites cannot live in peace. I have had to move two times because of blacks changing a  neighborhood for the worse. Once from Hyattsville MD, and then from Bowie MD after  Bowie gave out and was conquered. </p>

		<p>Prince Georges County should change it`s name to Zimbawee West. When we were Rving up there, we slept with our 357s on the table between us. Hordes of thugs that hang out at the parking lots of malls are so dangerous that signs say do not stop for pedestrians who wave you down. Even the fast food joints are a freak show.Blacks muscle their way ahead of you in the check out lines and God only knows what they do to your food. I never felt so much overt hatred directed at strangers anywhere in my life time and I`ve been in a bunch of scarey places. What was remarkable was as soon as you cross over into Delaware or Virginia, the blacks become friendly and easy going like most folks everywhere else.I hope these freaks get off. Maryland deserves them.<br>

		<p>The town where Sam Francis lived when he died, Seabrook, is where I grew up from 1969-87.  In 1969, Seabrook was 99 % white.  Seabrook was part of that post-World War Two suburban explosion of Colonials, Split-Foyers, Split-Levels, Ramblers and Ranches, most of them brick and fairly well made.  But the seeds for the overthrow of 60s Seabrook were soon to be planted.  An all-black development was built in South Lanham and the Lanham Boys Club had its first blacks.  Busing integrated the schools with uncivilized, violent blacks from inner-county areas like Seat Pleasant, Palmer Park(hometown of boxer Sugar Ray Leonard), Kent Village, Dodge Park and Fairmont Heights, beginning in 1973.  The schools became half-black and the whites began to trickle out of Prince George&rsquo;s.  The trickle became a flood by the mid-80s.  When Sam Francis moved to Seabrook(geographically, Seabrook was a perfect place to live if you worked at the Washington Times as Sam Francis did until he was purged in the mid-90s)- I&rsquo;m guessing in the late 80s- it had a rundown look about it.  The supermarket closed and the Tastee Freeze closed.  The Italian Inn on Route 450- which Sam Francis must have passed when driving himself to the hospital for the last time- had surveillance cameras by the late 80s.  Prince George&rsquo;s Hospital, where Dr. Francis died in 2005, has received much of its funding from the state to thwart bankruptcy.  The hospital specializes in trauma surgery.</p>

		<p>Richard&hellip;.remember the black professor and the white cop?  Even blacks with PHD&rsquo;s for crying out loud simmer with violence and attitude just under the surface.  ALL blacks have been taught for the last four decades to blame the white man, hate the white man, displace the white man, and that slapping an unruly black kid is a hate crime, but raping, torturing and killing a white couple is NOT a hate crime.  ALL blacks have this violence just under the surface - even in white collar careers and colleges - as soon as they reach a point of frustration due to reaching their level of incompetence or not being given something they think is due them that violence and attitude surfaces very quickly.  Whites don&rsquo;t form flash mobs to trash black businesses and assault blacks on the streets.  Whites don&rsquo;t have &#8220;beat blackie day&#8221;.  Whites don&rsquo;t stand around laughing, applauding, and participating when ten or 12 whites jump a single black guy.  Violence, especially toward whites, is within ALL blacks - and can be brought to the surface over any perceived slight, any whim of impulse, any denial of their demands.  Whites do not set fire to their neighborhoods &#8220;in protest&#8221; and then SHOOT at the firemen who show up to save their neighborhoods.  The few blacks who seem upper class exhibit only a veneer which when scratched reveals innate hatefulness, violence, and dishonesty.  ALL of them.<br>
Colin Powell was one of the most white acting blacks on the surface - a military officer whose career was entirely based upon AA and whites elevating him - yet he immediately jumped on board Obama&rsquo;s train simply because Obama was black - KNOWING Obama was a marxist and against everything Colin Powell had sworn to protect.  Blacks cannot be trusted, ever.  Period.  They are the worst of the worst.<br>
They react as a group with violence so out of the norm for any perceived motivation as to be psychotic, and it is a RACIAL characteristic.  Name me ONE non-violent, non-corrupt black nation anywhere in the world.  You can&rsquo;t.  Violence and corruption are rampant at all levels of society in every black nation.  </p>

		<p>While I think I&rsquo;ve passed through PG County a few times, I&rsquo;ve never really spent time there, so I&rsquo;m curious about its characterization as a slum by several posters here. Is it really ALL run down and ghetto? Frankly, I find that difficult to believe. Even in Oakland, California, where I grew up, there are black neighborhoods that are low crime and relatively well kept up. Certainly an area the size of PG, with such a large concentration of high income blacks, must have many low crime, reasonably kept up black areas. </p>

		<p>We all know what Johnson&rsquo;s next move will be. Allege this prosecution is nothing but a racist conspiracy against him and his wife, despite all evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Why do blacks play the race card? Because it works.</p>

		<p>I grew up and went to school in Bowie, starting in kindergarten in 1995. When I started public school it was a blue ribbon, majority white school with most of the black population coming in from forced busing. My family moved me out of Bowie in 2007, and by the time I was 17 Bowie high was maybe 30% white and falling fast. I saw Bowie go from a safe, white suburb with good schools in a county with awful schools, to a mostly black, crime ridden shell of what it once was. Shame Bowie got all the nice commercial developments after it went majority black.</p>

<p>Where do you get your statistics from? Anyone can rant and rave about things. That does not make it true. In fact, I agree with the two fellow posters who say that you should not engage in such blatant generalizations.</p>
<p>It is only self defeating to do so.</p>

<p>Where do YOU and the two posters you defend get YOUR statistics and generalizations that Whites are as bad as blacks?</p>
<p> Can you prove I am wrong?  As for ranting and raving, I would hardly count my experience living around blacks and seeing what blacks do over the years and their crime statistics and news articles by the thousands of rich and poor blacks and their behaviors, crimes, and their hate Whitey rhetoric, as ranting and raving on my part. </p>
<p>To you posters who have come here of late,(hummm) to defend blacks and assorted minorities, and get upset with those of us who speak some truths and of COURSE defend our own race and our societies, our ingenuity, our culture, etc. then I suggest you go to the millions of forums out in cyber space that are chock full of the leftie Whites, the colored races, etc. and leave us to the few sites that we racially aware Whites, can gather and post our comments on these Amren articles.  </p>

<p>If you had read my post CAREFULLY, you will see that I never said anything about Whites being as bad as Blacks or any other racial group. Those are YOUR words.</p>
<p>What I said was (and I will say again) is that you, me or anyone should not engage in such blatant generalizations about an entire group of people be the Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, Arabs, Asians, Gays and Lesbians, Disabled people etc&hellip; No group of people is monolithic and it is myopic, misguided and irresponsible to do so. </p>

<p>You are correct. There are many nice Black neighborhoods in Prince Georges county. In fact, one of our regular posters, Courtney posted a comment awhile back mentioning the fact that she travled through several neighborhoods in the county and commented on how she saw many well dressed people, two parent famiies, thriving businesses, clean streets and parks etc&hellip; </p>
<p>As someone who used to live in Fairfax County (I live in Denver now) which is a neighboring suburb, I can attest to the fact that I used to ride through Prince Georges County at times, and there were indeed many well kept, beautiful neighborhoods there. </p>
<p>Most of the people who are making comments on this board have probably not even visited the area and are primarily relying on unreliable and unsubstantiated comments from the more unhinged posters on this board.   </p>

		<p>Peter, I lived in Prince George&rsquo;s County from birth in 1960 until 1991, when I moved to the Eastern Shore.  My parents continued to live in PG County until 1995.  So I know of what I write.  And, yes, there are neighborhoods filled with large homes in PG County.  This is especially true as one drives out Central Avenue east of the beltway.  The old tobacco fields of the Croom area have sprouted with large homes as has the Upper Marlboro area.  Older neighborhoods like Laurel, Bowie, Glenn Dale, Kettering, Glenarden and Seabrook have nice homes.  Due to the high amount of government workers, their is a certain degree of affluence in PG County.  Yet crime is high, the schools are terrible and major restaurant and upscale stores stay away from PG like the plague.  Whites have been in flight from PG County for thirty-five years.</p>

<p>Guess you told us &#8220;unhinged&#8221; posters a thing or two, right?  So what if there are a FEW nice, well kept black neighborhoods? No one said there wasn&rsquo;t. Do you think those blacks who live behind those doors care one whit about White peoples and their survival? Do you think that maybe they are all law abiding, honest and moral people and did not prosper due to affirmative action that allowed them to get the jobs, the college degrees to live in those neighborhoods to begin with? At whose expense?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, I bet William Jefferson, Michael Vick, Al Sharpton, OJ Simpson, Jesse Jackson, sports stars, rap artists, etc. etc. are living in these well-kept areas also, right? I have seen well kept neighborhoods with black pimps and drug dealers as the residents. </p>
<p>  So let&rsquo;s not generalize, oh no, and let&rsquo;s just say MOST blacks are an addition to this nation and to our people and to the survival of both. </p>
<p>As for those of us who you call unreliable and unsubstantiated posters, then I will still say it again, 95 to 99% of blacks are NOT good for any White nation. If that is a &#8220;generalization&#8221; then so be it.</p>

<p>That is NexMedia&rsquo;s take on it.  In case you don&rsquo;t know, NexMedia is a Taiwanese YouTube channel that sets various current news items to animation.  The spoken language is Chinese, but they give you English subtitles.  However, the animations are done well enough such that I find the subtitles unnecessary.</p>

<p>In case you were unaware of this fact, O.J.Simpson is currently in prison. Therefore, he is not living in any neighborhood.</p>
