			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Johnson, KSAZ-TV (Phoenix), Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tennessee lawmaker is in hot water after making some racial remarks in session on Tuesday. Representative Curry Todd, who represents Collierville, compared pregnant, illegal immigrants to multiplying rats. </p>
<p>He said they are ushered into the U.S. healthcare system without being checked for citizenship. He&rsquo;s angry, and so is the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The conversation started about healthcare and verifying citizenship for pregnant, illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the federal government, we cannot ask for immigration documents or verify that information because we are providing coverage to the unborn,&#8221; said a member of the Fiscal Review Committee.</p>
<p>Not the answer representative Curry Todd wanted to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can go out there like rats, and multiply them, I guess,&#8221; said Todd.</p>
<p>On the phone, from Nashville, Todd explained what he meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe my words were a little harsh on that. I probably should have used anchor babies which are what they are called in Arizona and Texas,&#8221; said Todd.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to see any child not have care, but I feel they are abusing our system here because they know they can get these kids services, and the taxpayers in Tennessee are the ones having to pay for this, its not them,&#8221; said Todd.</p>
<p>Francisco Correa, the editor of La Prensa Latina here in the Bluff City, said his beliefs are up for debate, in a more respectful way.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Correa said the comments are insulting to the entire Hispanic community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry if other people got offended but I&rsquo;m not going to be hooked up in political correctness,&#8221; said Todd.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>(Reporter) &#8220;Are you willing to apologize to anyone who may have been offended?&#8221; </p>
<p>(Todd) &#8220;No. I&rsquo;m not apologizing to anyone who may have been offended. I used the wrong terminology.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sidney Mendelson, publisher of The Bilingual Newspaper, said an apology is not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;This person needs to be removed from office, and there is no apology needed,&#8221; said Mendelson.</p>

<p>I did indeed send Mr. Todd a supportive telegram.</p>
<p>I told him it was so refreshing to see someone NOT give in to these nambie-pambies. </p>
<p>WE THIRST for a demonstration of clean, masculine energy. </p>

		<p>Good for him!  A few years ago, any politician or media figure saying something politically incorrect would be apologizing like a mewling little baby (Don Imus was a good example).  But Bill O&rsquo;Reilley got away with saying there is a Muslim problem in the world, Juan Williams was able to let the world know his fear of sharing a airplane with a Muslim, and now a Tennessee representative has likened illegal immigrants to rats and has refused to apologize.  We need more brave men like Curry to represent us.</p>

		<p>Good for him! The worst thing he could do is back down.   The left shuts down debate by calling anyone who questions the special privileges of illegals a bigot.  The more unapologetic nativists who speak out the better. </p>
<p>I recommend any public speaker supporting our side to fend off name-calling using simple techniques. If your opponent,,says &#8216;you&rsquo;re a racist!&#8221;, ask them to define what they mean by racist. Naturally they&rsquo;ll shoot back the canned response that a  racist is someone that believes in the superiority of one race over all others. After this bring up the statements and beliefs of La  Raza,  MeCHA, the concept of  Atzlan and the reconquista,etc. Keep this up and people may come over to our way of seeing things.  </p>
<p>  The most disgusting and craven thing to do is apologize. It&rsquo;s an admission of weakness. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing any problem associated with &#8216;Hispanics&rsquo; referred to as a RACIAL problem.  Hispanic is not a race; it&rsquo;s nothing more than a misnomer.  There are Black, White, Indian and everything in between in Latin America.</p>
<p>That being said, most WHITE Latin Americans have nothing but contempt for non-White Latin Americans and rightfully so.  Most educated (and Legal) White Latin Americans integrate into American society quite well.  It&rsquo;s most of the non-White Latin Americans that refuse to adopt our customs, our language and our values that are the ones we should be concerned with.</p>

		<p>Since when have illegal immigrants been a race?  They are just criminals as the name implies so how can the &#8220;dreaded&#8221; word racist be used against Rep. Todd?  The liberals are really putting their feet in their mouths and it is a pity i was not nearby when the comment was made as I would have shouted this out with my stentorian voice.</p>

		<p>As has been pointed out here, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is not a race. The term refers to the native language evolved by a European nation, forged as a mixture of Iberian Celts and Nordic Visigoths, that later mixed with some Mariscos and Conversos. The use of the linguistic term to describe all peoples touched by the empire-building of the Iberian nations   &mdash;   including even Indios, some of whom don&rsquo;t even speak Spanish well or at all  &mdash;  - would have dazed Medieval Spaniards, whose leadership (ironically) were very keen on racial purity. In any case, anyone in the contemporary US who stands up for our right to say what we think and act in accordance with native common sense and tradition, such as this Tennessee rep, is a hero. </p>

		<p>Hopefully Mr. Todd will maintain his integrity and not grovel. An interesting situation should develop. If hispanics continue to protest his comment then widespread publicity will direct attention to what most of us already know that hispanic women can&rsquo;t do much else besides popping out babies. It&rsquo;s secret that &#8220;Safe Surrender Sites&#8221; in Mexifornia are designed for the perpetually pregnant hispanics. You see the logo signs &#8220;Safe Surrender Site&#8221; on fire department buildings throughout the LA region. Mr Todd should point this out.</p>

		<p>Unlike all the grovelers, Curry Todd doesn&rsquo;t have to apologize because there is no hispanic community in Collierville to offend. On the other hand, it is actually politically expediant for him not to do so. I can&rsquo;t believe that there are a more race realist people in the US than the whites of southwestern Tennessee. The citizens of Collierville are all crack veterans of diversity and could care less about offending illegals. Collierville and the surrounding suburbs were nothing more than country cross roads until Civil Rights, bussing, and riots, drove whites out of Memphis in the seventies. In the meantime, most of these individuals commute to Memphis (62% black as of 2000), which has since, become a sprawling ghetto, and witness the joys of diversity every day.  <br>

<p>Hey Mendelson, Curry Todd isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, and neither are we. We will not allow you people to bully us and to shove your marxist, anti-American agenda down our throats anymore. Look out the window. We are taking our country back, by whatever means necessary.</p>

		<p>As far as comparing breeding rats to illegals, frankly I prefer rats. I used to be a breeder of rats for the herp trade, and was breeding over a thousand rats a week. As long as the conditions were good, with clean litter, water and food, their babies thrived, and the offspring didn&rsquo;t go around rioting.<br>
Several years back, I lived in a rundown motel while working a consulting assignment. On one side was a local black drug dealer; on the other was a clan of illegals working for a forestry comapny. I never had any problems with the pusher, but I had to point a loaded gun at one of the illegals to get them to stop their antics.</p>

<p>Well, given that most Hispanics in the United States are either mestizos or mulattoes, the problems with them generally are racial problems. Also, Hispanics who are &#8220;whiter&#8221; are generally not a problem. However, since in most Latino countries the white population (or light-skinned population) forms the upper class, they have little reason to emigrate. The exceptions are Venezuela (where Chavez&rsquo;s policies are driving out the lighter-skinned middle and upper classes), and Argentina, which has had a poor economy for the last decade or so.</p>

		<p>Are Todd&rsquo;s accusers actually trying to suggest that illegal aliens are somehow NOT just like breeding rats?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculuous; instead of apologizing, Mr. Todd should be publically ridiculing them.</p>
