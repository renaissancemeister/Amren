			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 12, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A jury has hit the state with $1.73 million in damages in a suit by the family of an illegal immigrant who died of penile cancer that went untreated during more than a year in state and federal custody.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found state prison doctors partly to blame Wednesday for the death of Francisco Castaneda in February 2007. A separate suit against the federal government is tentatively scheduled for trial in April, the family&rsquo;s lawyers said Thursday.</p>
<p>Castaneda entered the United States with his mother in 1982, at age 10, after fleeing El Salvador during that country&rsquo;s civil war. He was convicted in 2005 of possessing methamphetamine and spent about four months in state prison, then was held in federal detention centers while the government moved to deport him and he applied for political asylum.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit he filed before his death, a doctor at North Kern Prison in Delano (Kern County) first noticed a growth on his penis in December 2005 and requested an immediate biopsy, but the prison&rsquo;s chief physician rejected it. Castaneda was then transferred to a prison in San Diego, where another doctor recommended a biopsy but failed to follow up, his lawyers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State lawyers denied that the physicians were responsible for Castaneda&rsquo;s death and argued that his cancer was untreatable. Lawyers for the family contended his life could have been saved with proper diagnosis and care.</p>
<p>The jury awarded Castaneda&rsquo;s 17-year-old daughter, Vanessa, $1.5 million for the loss of her father and $230,000 for past medical expenses, some of which will be reimbursed to Medi-Cal, her lawyers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally, after three years of the state denying responsibility, a jury of Vanessa&rsquo;s peers found that the state killed her father and recognized the tremendous loss with a full and fair verdict,&#8221; said Conal Doyle, her lead attorney.</p>
<p>State lawyers were unavailable for comment. They could appeal the verdict.<br>

		<p>Just like cervical cancer, penile cancer is basically an STD.  HPV is the most likely cause.  However, since it is so incredibly rare, the link is difficult to establish.</p>
<p>Rare that is, in the modern world.  In the third world, it accounts for up to 10% of all cancers in men.  The risk factors contributing to this are the usual&hellip;.promiscuity, especially the near universal homosexual promiscuity among men in the third world (google this issue and the research done by the US military in afghanistan for a fascinating bit of information few people in the western world know about), slovenly hygiene, drugs, and most especially AIDS.</p>
<p>Note that the standard treatment for this, unless caught extremely early in a first world medical system, is amputation of the penis.</p>
<p>The article does not mention this.  The REASON this man&rsquo;s cancer was considered &#8220;untreatable&#8221; was, likely, at the stage of cancer he had, he would not have consented to treatment.  None of the doctors wanted to confront him with the fact that it was either amputate the penis (and likely die anyway&hellip;..as it sounds like his cancer was extremely advanced) or die.</p>
<p>Ironically, a lawsuit is one of the things they were probably seeking to avoid.  Could you imagine what would be said if they lopped off this man&rsquo;s penis and he died anyway.  Or even if he lived, and claimed he could have been treated effectively in other ways?</p>

		<p>This is a hate crime against the people of the United States. Every elected representative, whether D or R, must bear responsibility for this, insofar as they have not halted the invasion of the US by Mexican supremacists. The money should come from the &#8220;leaders&#8221; who allowed this to happen. Instead, Hispanic Supremacy wins the day.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t penile cancer something only promiscuous uncircumcised men get? So why should we feel sorry. Also, he used his wonderful opportunity living in the good old USA to commit criminal acts instead of get a GED, buy a home, and work toward legal status. I&rsquo;m not feeling much sympathy here, but I am feeling puzzlement over what sort of idiot jury would hand this guy&rsquo;s clan 1.7 mil just because he got a case of rod rot.</p>

		<p>I am SICK of these illegals being allowed to sue us for anything! Casteneda was obviously an illegal at the age of 10, making his daughter an anchor baby who is now a millionaire at taxpayer expense!  Yet when these illegals rape, murder, assault and commit crimes here we can never sue them can we? These inmates (especially illegals)should never receive all this free medical help in the first place! They get access to better health care than we ever will and all of it is free. We lose our own parents everyday (who aren&rsquo;t even criminals) and sure don&rsquo;t get a dime for their loss.  I don&rsquo;t think this guy was much of a father to begin with and his daughter saw the $$$ signs and stuck it to us.</p>

		<p>Well, I hate like hell to say it, but I think the government did fall down on this one.  I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t speak to the amount, but yes, when you are in custody, the state has a duty to take care of you and your medical needs.  One of the costs of being a civilized society.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in agreement with the verdict on this one.  If the government incarcerates someone they&rsquo;re obligated to give him the proper medical care he requires for a serious illness.</p>
<p>But can you imagine anybody collecting a settlement from California, when it can&rsquo;t even pay for necessities to keep it going?</p>
<p>That settlement, plus a buck and a half, will get the illegal&rsquo;s family a cup of coffee.</p>

		<p>Figures this amount would be awarded in &#8220;Kalifornia&#8221;. Way too much. Just another brown person winning in the good ole&rsquo; USA ghetto lottery! An illegal immigrant drug user/dealer too! Such a sterling example of humanity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see if a white person could get this amount awarded in Tijuana North. Bet they wouldn&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s hope they appeal this verdict, because the amount needs to be greatly reduced. And if he was illegal, chances are she&rsquo;s an anchor baby. She should be told her only award is not to be deported. </p>

		<p>Why not award him the $1.7 million? The citizen of California believe everyone deserves a free ride. I mean after all its not their money. It&rsquo;s the taxpayers money and the jury  probably hasn&rsquo;t paid a dime of taxes in  their lives.</p>
<p>I think they  should have sent the prisoner  to  Cuba for treatment. Didn&rsquo;t Michel Moore shows us what a wonderful health care system Cuba has?  </p>
<p>&#8220;The jury awarded Castaneda&rsquo;s 17-year-old daughter, Vanessa, $1.5 million&#8221; A 17 year old millionaire. I wonder how long she will have the money?</p>

<p>I am a citizen of California and I do not believe everyone deserves a free ride. Especially ILLEGALs and criminals. Don&rsquo;t lump all of us in with the nutcases and socialists who want to destroy all of us! As for it being the law to give inmates all the health care they want, then why is it that few of us who do pay the taxes, cannot afford to get the health care we NEED? That law needs to be changed that prisoners can get what we can&rsquo;t. They are CRIMINALS and should have NO &#8220;rights&#8221; that bleed us even further. They have even paid for all the costs of a trans-gender to get all the treatment IT wanted. What happened to COMMON SENSE? </p>

		<p>The inmates daughter does deserve some moolah, but not so much. The system should have treated his cancer. But that is nothing compared to the TWENTY MILLION that was handed out to the relatives of a 5 year old hispanic child that was killed at 24th and Potrero in SF by a city employee(hispanic) who hit her because he ran a red light.There cant ba a city in the world worse than San francisco when it comes to dishing out huge awards. </p>

<p>Then we need to get rid of anyone being a ward of the State! We did not use to do this! They got medical care up to a point! Not for something that will cost us even more of our money. WE don&rsquo;t even get the kind of health care that prisoners get, so why is it our &#8220;duty&#8221; to pay billions out for them?  That guy was a CRIMINAL and his daughter made out like a bandit because he died. I doubt that he was even a &#8220;father&#8221; to her in the real sense to begin with and she is now raking in all this money and for WHAT? His contribution to America and I am sure he was &#8220;supporting&#8221; her. The taxpayers paid for her welfare all her life, I am positive. So how much has this criminal father ever contributed a dime compared to what he has cost us? That goes for all those criminals in prison. </p>
