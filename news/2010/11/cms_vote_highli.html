<h1>CMS Vote Highlights Deep Divide; Accusations of Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Doss Helms and Eric Frazier, Charlotte Observer, Nov. 11, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the wake of Tuesday&rsquo;s bitterly divisive school board meeting, marked by split votes and shouted accusations of racism, there&rsquo;s one point of agreement: Public confidence in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools&rsquo; leadership hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Members of the board majority say they made tough choices  &mdash;  the first of many ahead  &mdash;  to close underfilled buildings and underperforming schools in hopes of dealing with looming budget deficits while protecting teachers and bolstering academic success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the schools we closed are in the African-American community. That&rsquo;s factually accurate,&#8221; board Chair Eric Davis said Wednesday. &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t close them because they&rsquo;re in the African-American community.&#8221;</p>
<p>But many say the results have raised suspicion, whatever the motives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African-American community is more disturbed by the action of the board last night than I&rsquo;ve seen them since the lifting of the desegregation order,&#8221; said civil rights lawyer James Ferguson, referring to court rulings a decade ago. &#8220;The scars run deep, and the board has exacerbated the wounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx: &#8220;This issue exposed some wedges in our community, and the split vote by the school board is evidence that there&rsquo;s significant repair work to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Wednesday, families from Waddell High, which will close at the end of this school year, called on other affected families to file civil-rights complaints with the U.S. Education Department.</p>
<p>Waddell parents said their children aren&rsquo;t being treated the same as students in suburban high schools, which have been largely unaffected by the changes. The agency enforces federal laws prohibiting discrimination in programs or activities that receive federal money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some community leaders, black and white, give the school board credit for making tough decisions and trying to listen to citizens. But many say CMS leaders must find new ways to connect with minorities, even in the face of competing demands from groups that traditionally have more clout.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino activists also have weighed in. Waddell, for instance, has a large Hispanic population.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s happening here today is genocide,&#8221; Maudia Melendez of the Jesus Ministry, an organization that works in Charlotte&rsquo;s Latino community, said at Wednesday&rsquo;s Waddell news conference. &#8220;All these (public) meetings that we had, they were just a front. They already had their minds made up.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think that rather than close the black/latino schools they should have expanded them!  Shower money on those schools with classes on basketball, basket weaving and pregnancy and baby rearing.  </p>
<p>Give all meals free.  Pass everyone with poster board projects.  Have a free clothing office.  Anything and everything to make these places MAGNETS for all blacks and latinos.  </p>
<p>Then they will leave those raciss&rsquo; mostly white schools, which can be made more uninviting by having requirements for taking really hard classes.  </p>
<p>How to pay for all that?  Ask Obama and Arne Duncan.</p>

		<p>The black &#8220;leadership&#8221; never fails for humor and irony. What they either don&rsquo;t realize or wont admit is that the black students who might be saved from ignorance and drowning in a culture that considers Michael Jackson, Kanye West or Barack Obama as symbols of success. would be better off if all public schools with more than a bare minimum of black students were all shut down.  </p>
<p>The competent Afro students, and there are some, could qualify for vouchers of around ten grand, i.e., what public schools in most suburbs spend, to purchase a spot in a private or church run accredited school. The costs of the vouchers would be far less than the tens of billions spent now on holding pens for unteachable kids.</p>
<p>As for the rest, well it&rsquo;s hopeless, and the latest data on the persistent &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; despite billions in &#8220;education&#8221; spending targeted to disadvantaged, blah blah, show that obvious result.</p>

<p>Whatever the motives, there&rsquo;s always suspicions. They claim to want better schools for their kids but they want to keep them exactly the same.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, there is no solution.</p>
<p>The solution I would offer is one they would never accept; their own schools run the way they want. That is the one thing they don&rsquo;t want. They have to be around whites because they know they can&rsquo;t do anything for themselves. And when their kids fail, they have the white man to blame.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t.<br>

		<p>Note the contradiction:  Black civil rights leaders want deseg, but when the black schools inevitably empty out, and the logical thing is to close them, they complain about that.  They&rsquo;ll complain about anything just to hear themselves complain.  And because they think you&rsquo;ll respond with money and groveling.  Easy answer:  Stop listening to them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;CMS pumps millions into providing extra teachers, supplies and technology into high-poverty and mostly minority schools&hellip;the high-poverty Thomasboro Elementary at the top, getting about $11,000 per student, while the suburban Community House Middle is near the bottom at $4,000, Gorman said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grrrrr&hellip;!!! </p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the way it is, I have a solution!! I&rsquo;m serious!</p>
<p>They are spending almost THREE times as much money on each poor minority student as on each suburban student, $11,000 per year vs. $4,000 per year.</p>
<p>So reduce the amount spent on each poor minority student to the same as spent on each suburban student, and pay the difference of $7,000 directly to the poor minority student.</p>
<p>That would be payments of about $180 (good Lord!&hellip;SO much money is being spent!!) to each poor minority student each week of the school year, but contingent on the student getting at least a C on a weekly test that is of rigor equivalent to tests of the 1950s.</p>
<p>A good percentage of the students who can do it will do it (and they&rsquo;ll make the others shut up in class so they can learn the material to do it), and the ones who discover that they simply can&rsquo;t do it will finally have learned something useful in school.</p>
<p>Not a bad plan, conceived at first in jest to cool myself off from reading those ridiculous numbers. Any extra money should be spent educating our geniuses and above average students, since they will manage the future.</p>

<p>Well now, I&rsquo;d say that was a pretty good reason to go back to Mexico where you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about racism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m positive she would be much happier there.</p>
<p>I know I would be, especially if she took about 20 million of her tribesmen with her.</p>

		<p>Too bad Bush is not in the WH as he would be deeply hurt and saddened if they called him a racist and would pump billions into the situation to make it better and relieve the mental anguish and emotion he felt inside tearing his silver spoon elitist Yale Harvard brat soul apart. </p>

<p>No, not <i>public confidence</i>,Ann and Eric.  I&rsquo;m sure that the White public has no problems at all with closing &#8220;underperforming&#8221; (read: black) schools.  What you mean is <i>touchy black egos</i>.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Most of the schools we closed are in the African-American community. That&rsquo;s factually accurate.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that it is.  And that should be the end of the story. But&hellip;</p>

<p>The &#8220;african american community&#8221; is <i>always</i> &#8220;disturbed&#8221; by <i>something</i>, whenever it feels that it&rsquo;s not being treated like the pinnacle of God&rsquo;s creation.  Isn&rsquo;t it about time the rest of us stopped caring about &#8220;disturbing&#8221; their dysfunctional &#8220;community?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here today is genocide,&rdquo; Maudia Melendez of the Jesus Ministry, an organization that works in Charlotte&rsquo;s Latino community.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>No, Maudia.  If it were really &#8220;genocide&#8221; (do you even know what the word means?), there wouldn&rsquo;t <i>be</i> a &#8220;Latino community&#8221; in Charlotte.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But many say CMS leaders must find new ways to connect with minorities&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And just exactly who <i>are</i> these unnamed &#8220;many?&#8221;  And how &#8220;many&#8221; of them are there?  I have a strong suspicion that &#8220;many&#8221; means &#8220;whiney, spoiled blacks and browns with a chip on their collective shoulder against the Whites who support them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just why the Charlotte school board &#8220;must find new ways to connect with minorities&#8221; is never explained.  It&rsquo;s simply taken for granted by blacks, browns and liberals with an agenda.  Hey, I have an idea   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s start expecting those &#8220;minorities&#8221; to &#8220;connect&#8221; with <i>us</i> for a change!  And I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> mean in their traditional ways of &#8220;connecting,&#8221; such as rape, robbery, murder and welfare.<br>

		<p>ALL government funded public schools should be closed  &mdash;  period. Parents should have to BUY their children&rsquo;s education, either through an accredited private or church school or through a private tutor. Then they should check and double check what their child is learning on a daily basis to make sure they are getting their money&rsquo;s worth. Don&rsquo;t say it can&rsquo;t be done. My grandparents paid for 12 years of very good, private church schooling for me, and they were living on their social security pension with NO extra social programs, and raising me to boot. It isn&rsquo;t easy but IT CAN BE DONE! If parents won&rsquo;t put out the effort to educate the children they bring into this world, they will have to live with the results, which in any case won&rsquo;t be all that different from what they are getting now.  </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;There seems to be so much anger out there, and we need to find out where that anger is coming from,&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I think the anger arises from their un-admitted realization that they, as a racial group, are a miserable failure. Their kids just can&rsquo;t hack it in spite of all the special efforts and extra money dump on their schools. But they don&rsquo;t have the honesty to direct their anger at themselves.</p>
<p>The Non-black population should not have to foot the bill to subsidize black failure. The school board decision is fair.</p>

		<p>Genocide?  Oh come on.  I guess &#8220;genocide&#8221; menas something else in Spanish.  Well, in English, Miss Melendez, the word &#8220;Genocide&#8221; (noun) means to exterminate or forcibly relocate an entire population of people.  I&rsquo;m not sure how closing down some schools is killing anybody, or forcing them to move.  Sure, they may want to move closer to the new school their child is assigned to, but by no stretch of the imagination does that constitute genocide.  You wanna talk about genocide?  The Holocaust was genocide.  The removal of millions of Germans after WWII was genocide.  The Ruandan civil wars were genocidal.  What YOUR people are doing to our country is even a form of genocide.  But the closing of a few schools in North Carolina? - it is not genocide.</p>

		<p>So genocide is no longer mass murder of some particular group of people.  It&rsquo;s now anything that upsets blacks or Hispanics.  The real reason blacks oppose the closing of black schools is because they see the primary purpose of black run schools as providing employment to blacks.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the children don&rsquo;t actually get educated.<br>
