<h1><a href="http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/11/two-dallas-narcotics-detective.html">Two Dallas Narcotics Detectives on Restrictive Duty After Scuffle Over Racial Slurs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tanya Eiserer, Dallas Morning News, Nov. 15, 2010 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Dallas narcotics detectives have been placed on restrictive duty after they got into a scuffle, possibly because one uttered racial slurs at the other during an earlier incident.</p>
<p>Both detectives are black.</p>
<p>The detectives, Charles Palmer and Dennis Malone, got into the scuffle in a parking garage at police headquarters about noon Friday. {snip}</p>
<p>Police say tension arose between the detectives earlier in the week when an undercover narcotics officer, who is white, asked Malone, who is black, for his assistance transporting a man arrested on a drug charge to jail.</p>
<p>Malone told supervisors that during that incident, on Wednesday, Palmer began calling him names because he had agreed to help the white officer. Malone told supervisors that Palmer, who is black, began calling him an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; and the &#8220;N-word&#8221; as they were taking the prisoner to jail.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re waiting on the public integrity investigation to determine what actions will be taken,&#8221; said Acting Assistant Chief Julian Bernal. &#8220;The whole issue is problematic   &mdash;   using those kinds of names whether you&rsquo;re talking to another officer or not. It kind of transcends into the public. If you&rsquo;re using that terminology with another officer, you&rsquo;re probably using that terminology with the public.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the attitude of plenty of black officers.  Many times black police, especially black women, will openly side with black criminals.  </p>

&#8220;Blacks are only looking for race before they judge in every situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems to be true.<br>
It doesn&rsquo;t even matter if  one black is a police officer and the other a drug dealer. If boths are black, blacks thing they should not do anything.</p>

<p>Freedom Of Speech.  Ain&rsquo;t it just a gritch when the &#8216;right&rsquo; person uses it for _the same_ reasons.</p>
<p>Of course &#8216;waiting on&rsquo; is codespeak for &#8220;Shhhhhh, and maybe it will just go away&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you imagine what these two must be like as partners in the same division and department, if they can&rsquo;t keep it together long enough to settle their business OUTSIDE the premises?</p>
<p>I wonder how long they have been detective rank.</p>

		<p>Uncle Tom?  C&rsquo;mon!  I&rsquo;ve heard much, much worse than that. But normally it&rsquo;s hushed up and never gets out to the press or to the public. Departments know how to sweep their own dirt under the carpet. What&rsquo;s wrong with the Dallas PD? </p>
<p>This is unusual only in that it&rsquo;s in the newspaper. Not unusual otherwise.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be simply amazing if they were to grant the offended officer some form of compensation for pain and suffering.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem that implausible.</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if this created a precedent, whereby a Black person could garner monetary compensation for discrimination from ANOTHER BLACK PERSON.  As incredible as it sounds, it doesn&rsquo;t seem all that implausible.</p>

<p>Is there better evidence of anti-white hatred in that department, which is really the norm in the black community all across the US?  The reporter on the story never mentioned one word about the Jeremiah Wright attitude of the black who thinks other blacks shouldn&rsquo;t help whites.</p>
<p>Obviously she&rsquo;s another white coward who is afraid to call out blatant anti-white hatred.  But refusing to do so, she encourages other blacks to do the same knowing they won&rsquo;t be called on it.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m o.k. with that.  The more this kind of black attitude gets out the more aware whites will pick up on it, and I&rsquo;d like  every white in this country, with a spine, to understand that Jeremiah Wright is not the exception among blacks, but the norm.</p>
<p>The police chief in Dallas is black.  I checked the web site, searching for an email contact number for him, but couldn&rsquo;t locate any.  Strange.  Most every city I&rsquo;ve ever checked had a contact email address for the chief of police.</p>
<p>Dallas is another city that sycophantically bows down to blacks by appointing a black racist as chief of police who obviously condones anti-white hatred or it wouldn&rsquo;t pop to the surface as revealed in the remarks by this black anti-white hater.</p>
<p>Spineless, do-gooder whites are one of the biggest problems we face.</p>

		<p>My guess is the suspect was black. Had he been white, the black officers would jump at the chance to &#8220;arrest&#8221; him.</p>

<p>Just as the Connecticutt trail of the two men (dogs they are) in that case are white received weeks of headline reporting because they were white.  Must be, because the Christian/Newsome case was even more heinous than that one.  Yet it barely got mentioned.<br>

<p>I used to work in the &#8220;human rights&#8221; field.  a black complained that another black superior was discriminating against him on the basis of race.  When I said that it sounds ridiculous he said that the black superior was doing the dirty work of even higher up whites.  In other words.. blacks discriminate against other blacks at the pressure of powerful whites.</p>
<p>Got to laugh.  Either they are the stupidest people on earth, or they think we are because we&rsquo;ve let them come as far as they have.</p>

		<p>Gee, isn&rsquo;t it great to see the real-life benefits of decades of affirmative-action hiring in the public sector?  This story sort of reminds me of the aftermath of Katrina when NOPD officers of color went over to the other side and joined their &#8220;oppressed&#8221; brothers and sisters in carting away everything that wasn&rsquo;t nailed down. Yes, indeed, just as the liberal white nincompoops driving little fuel-efficient vehicles plastered with &#8220;I Love Diversity&#8221; bumper stickers have been preaching for years, diversity is a wonderful thing for all of us.</p>
