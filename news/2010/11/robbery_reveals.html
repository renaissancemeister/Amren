<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The robbery of Gert Boyle last week was part of a plot to kidnap the 86-year-old chairwoman of Columbia Sportswear and hold her for an undisclosed ransom, according to documents released Tuesday by the Clackamas County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. </p>
<p>A law-enforcement source familiar with the investigation said the kidnap plot appears to be &#8220;part of a larger conspiracy&#8221; extending beyond the three suspects now in custody. </p>
<p>Details of the plot remain unclear. Investigators declined to discuss who planned the crime, how many people were involved and whether more arrests are imminent. </p>
<p>Three Honduran immigrants, all from the Beaverton area, are being held in the Clackamas County Jail on charges including burglary, robbery, coercion, assault and kidnapping. Federal authorities have placed holds on all three suspects for investigation of their immigration status. </p>
<p>One of the men, Jose Luis Arevalo, 47, told investigators that he drove his van to Boyle&rsquo;s house &#8220;for the purpose of kidnapping her in exchange for $20,000,&#8221; according to a probable cause document filed with the Clackamas County Jail.</p>
<p>The other two suspects, Ramon Alberto Midence, 41, and Nestor Gabriel Caballero Gutierrez, 39, also admitted participating in the robbery of Boyle, according to the documents. </p>
<p>Caballero Gutierrez confessed to robbing Boyle, according to the documents, and Midence said he was aware of what Caballero Gutierrez &#8220;was going to do when he dropped him off at the victim&rsquo;s residence.&#8221; Midence said he was not told how much he would be paid. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boyle had immediately become suspicious when the robber approached her offering a gift basket. As she tried to move away from the man, he pulled a handgun and demanded entry to her home. </p>
<p>Boyle pretended to go along with the gunman, telling him she had to disable the home alarm system. Instead, she pushed the silent panic button. </p>
<p>Within minutes, officer were at the door, and the robber fled. Several hours later, police found Caballero Gutierrez walking down a street wet, muddy and limping. He was carrying some of Boyle&rsquo;s jewelry. </p>

		<p>As we march quickly toward the coming chaos, we will see our business elites become targets of third world kidnapping and shakedowns.   </p>
<p>Good. These targets will be overwhelmingly White, and most of them have Diversity programs in their companies, and they make donations to colleges and universities that openly avow and practice vile, anti white hate policies through Diversity Is Our Strength and Safe Space Multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Kidnappings and worse are good for us.  Worse is better in a time or race crisis.<br>

		<p>Portland will just not learn.  The liberals of the Northwest are an afflicted, robotic bunch.  They read off the &#8220;leftist pledge&#8221; those stock, hackneyed political phrases, as if their utterance has a power all their own, with no real understanding or clue of their meaning.  They&rsquo;ve swallowed every slogan and slavishly stick to the formula no matter what goes on in the Southwest, and particularly California.  They think that they are superior to California (they only are geographically) and they compete by clumsy political jumps of leftist policies in the stupidest ways, with no reckoning or attempt to seek advantages from others experience.  They are vaingloriously determined to prove their righteousness.  They seem to think that their innate superiority will produce different results than the East Coast, or even the Southwest.  As a result, Oregon is an ecomomic and social shamble, and Washington is not far behind.</p>

		<p>My relatives are from a small Washington town just north of Portland, Ore. (Fortunately I&rsquo;m 3,000 miles from there.) They just could not understand why &#8216;we&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t like black people. I kept telling them they had just never lived around them or they wouldn&rsquo;t have to ask.</p>
<p>They came to visit me in the heart of the South a few years later. As we stood in a (typically) slow moving grocery store line due to the black cashier (I felt my aunt needed an education), my aunt turned to me and asked what was taking so long. I rolled my eyes toward the fat cashier moving at tortoise speed. She was busier conducting an ebonics conversation with the black customer in front of us than doing her job. Cashier and customer repeatedly cackled with each other, with numerous, GIRL! Whatchew tawkin&rsquo; bout!&#8221; thrown in, along with their typical jibberish.</p>
<p>As we left, my aunt, with big round eyes, asked me, &#8220;What language were they speaking?&#8221; I told her, &#8220;Jive.&#8221; She asked me what that was, and I told her it was lazy, black English. She then told me she didn&rsquo;t understand a word they were saying. And they sure were slow.  I said, &#8220;Welcome to black America. That&rsquo;s your first lesson.&#8221; </p>
<p>By the time she left a week later, my aunt was in the midst of an awakening.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time Hispanic expats have brought their crime styles this far north. A Mexican national was arrested for a kidnapping plot in Montreal, Canada three years ago.</p>

		<p>  So we can import a huge and growing population from Latin America, and not become Latin America? In the not so distant future immigrants will emigrate from Latin America to Estados Unidos (Latin America)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m certain that these upstanding Hispanic Latino gentlemen were forced into such regrettable actions by the Oppressive White Racism which robs them of their Human Dignity.  They and their entire families should be granted asylum in the nearest northwestern Sanctuary City, where they can be cared for at taxpayer expense and receive large cash settlements for the Mental Anguish they have had to endure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mandatory Sensitivity Training must be implemented for the (presumably White) reporter who wrote such Hurtful things about these Hispanic Immigrants.  And for Gert Boyle, who so thoughtlessly interfered with their entrepernurial plans, nothing less than Hate Crime charges will do.</p>
<p>Chant with me now, children: Diversity Is Our Strength.<br>

		<p>$20,000? This woman is chairwoman of a sportswear firm and that is all they wanted? Stupid to begin with.</p>
<p>Kidnapping too as a crime has almost disappeared from the American criminal scene except among &#8220;Latins&#8221;. An American criminal realizes that the crime of kidnapping is almost impossible to get away with and the imprisonment is for a long time. Penalties are stiff and little no chance of &#8220;getting away&#8221;!</p>
<p>The FBI has a good record of catching kidnappers and thwarting the crime. The transfer of ransom money is where the criminals get caught. You get the money but are caught more or less at the same time.  </p>
<p>Those from the various &#8220;amigo&#8221; countries just do not get it.</p>
