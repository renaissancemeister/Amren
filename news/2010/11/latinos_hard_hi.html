<h1>Latinos Hard Hit By Whooping Cough Epidemic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carolyn Salazar, FoxNews, October 28, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Latino community in California has been hard-hit by a recent epidemic of whooping cough that has killed 10 infants, nine of them Hispanic.</p>
<p>The outbreak of whooping cough, or pertussis, started in May in Fresco, Calif., and has already infected over 6,200 people across the state, making it the largest pertussis epidemic since 1950.</p>
<p>The California Department of Public Health does not break down the whooping cough cases by ethnicity, so there are no figures on the number of Hispanics that have been infected.</p>
<p>But almost all the deaths have been Hispanic infants, and the reason why is still unclear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeff Dimond, a spokesman for the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, said Hispanics have a couple factors working against them in the whooping cough epidemic. They tend to have large families and live in more enclosed spaces, he said, and some are not getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Having vaccinations is critical in the fight against the infection, he said, as is keeping those infected away from babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pertussis is extremely contagious, but it is also preventable,&#8221; Dimond said. {snip}</p>
<p>Whooping cough in an adult is commonly mistaken for a bad cough. But if the infection is spread to an infant, the consequences could be deadly because they do not have the immunity to fight it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dean Blumberg, who specializes in pediatric infectious disease, said that  &mdash;  while Hispanics could be at risk because they are more close-knit and tend to visit family members more often  &mdash;  there is no genetic disposition making Latinos more vulnerable.</p>
<p>But Blumberg is seeing outbreaks in areas where parents choose not to get their children immunized.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that they can&rsquo;t afford it or don&rsquo;t have access to vaccinations,&#8221; said Blumberg, an associate professor of pediatrics at University of California, Davis. &#8220;We are seeing geographic clustering in areas with lower immunization rates, where parents choose to opt out because they are reading stuff on the Internet.&#8221;</p>

It&rsquo;s cases like this that are going to embolden people to ensure that illegal aliens have access to universal health care (at tax payers expense).</p>
<p>Regardless how the law is written, exemptions will be found or made.</p>

		<p>All kinds of diseases are continually coming across the Mexican border into California with the illegals who then spread it to all.</p>
<p>Soon California will end up being a big hospital run by the federal government.  </p>
<p>This is one screwed up state, but Californians probably think that they have solved their problems by re-electing the same people who got them into their mess in the first place.  What&rsquo;s the definition of insanity? </p>

		<p>As I said in another, similar thread:  Vaccinations do not prevent disease.  Good hygiene and sanitation do.</p>
<p>And from what I&rsquo;ve heard of living conditions of many illegals&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Whooping cough has a three-to-four year cycle, and if a vaccinated child with whooping cough goes to the doctor, the illness is given another name. My most vaccinated child had the worst case of us all. Only half of the people who contract whooping cough (pertussis) have the characteristic &#8220;whoop&#8221; at the end of the cough. It manifests as only a cold in many others. There is no way to track who has it for certain, because many people do not realize they have it. Sanitation and diet most definitely affect contagion and severity.</p>

		<p>B. Pertussis is one of those enigma diseases that shows complex variant strains in both North and South America as well as Europe where it&rsquo;s first appearance in 1414 suggests that it is -not- endemic.</p>
<p>It has been associated (read virulently optimized as a contagion among) humans for a LONG time (2.5MYA) yet it&rsquo;s believed antecedent B. Brochiseptica shows no epidemiological association with the contemporary strains, nor do they with each other.</p>
<p>Originally (up until the 1940s) it was the quiet killer among youth with as many as 153 per 100,000 reported cases and thought to be many more.</p>
<p>Post-vaccination, this dropped to 1 in 100,000.  Sure proof of what happens when the social safety net is applied properly among an ethnic group that shares language and trust with each other&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rare cases of brain damage and death caused by whole-cell innoculates caused a shift to acellular vaccines with just a few (10 IIRR) antigens for the disease with &#8216;variable&rsquo; effects on both symptoms and contagiousness.</p>
<p>It is thought that this is why it is on the rise again with some 300,000 deaths per year, globally.  Among very young children and infants death is particularly brutal as asphyxia and apnea can cause breathing to stop without warning and coughing can be so bad in infants as to separate retina and even do brainstem injuries, resulting in functional deficits which don&rsquo;t appear until later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something to play around with, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
