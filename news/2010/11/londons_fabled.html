<h1>London&rsquo;s Fabled Mix of Wealth and Grit Under Threat by Housing Cuts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Stringer, Canadian Business, October 31, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s been at the heart of London&rsquo;s identity for decades: Bakers and bankers live on the same city streets in patchwork neighbourhoods where swank mansions sit in the shadow of grim tower blocks, and residents from all walks of life mingle in shops, schools and subway stations.</p>
<p>Now Britain&rsquo;s debt-shredding austerity measures will slash housing benefit payments used to subsidize rents for the low-paid, threatening to price tens of thousands of poor families out of their homes and force them toward the fringes of the country&rsquo;s capital  &mdash;  an exodus that could permanently erode London&rsquo;s famed ethnic, economic and cultural mix.</p>
<p>Outspoken London Mayor Boris Johnson likens the plan to &#8220;Kosovo-style social cleansing.&#8221; Some fear London will become more like Paris, where rich elites monopolize the city centre and the poor stagnate in decaying housing projects ringing the capital.</p>
<p>But in tough times, others wonder if Britain can still afford to help ordinary workers find homes in a city centre that keeps getting pricier, even as the overall economy shows only sluggish growth.</p>
<p>As part of 81 billion pounds (US$128 billion) of spending cuts announced last week to help wipe Britain&rsquo;s crippling debts, limits will be placed on the amount given to the poor to help them pay their rent.</p>
<p>One estimate predicts an exodus of about 200,000 people from central London, with low earning families forced toward down-at-heel outer suburbs and far-flung commuter towns  &mdash;  leaving the capital&rsquo;s streets reserved for the rich.</p>
<p>Critics worry the famously rowdy working class enclaves of London&rsquo;s East End  &mdash;  which gave Britain its defiant wartime spirit of the Blitz  &mdash;  will fall silent, and that the city&rsquo;s multicultural character could be lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best things about London is precisely that it is not like Paris  &mdash;  you have very rich people and people in social housing all living along the same street,&#8221; said Sian Berry, a former candidate for London mayor and part of the &#8220;No Shock Doctrine&#8221; campaign protesting against the government&rsquo;s cuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those people all use the same public services, the same shops, the same schools and the same transport  &mdash;  it helps make people more tolerant of each other,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Under the government&rsquo;s plans, which will be debated in Parliament and are yet to be finalized, a new limit will be set for the maximum amount families can claim to pay for privately rented homes, and no family will be able to use welfare payments to rent a home with more than 4 bedrooms.</p>
<p>Britons who earn less than 16,000 pounds ($25,500) per year and have only limited savings are entitled to claim housing benefit  &mdash;  which can be used to rent a house or flat, but not for mortgage payments.</p>
<p>Those who rent from private landlords have their benefits calculated using an average rental price in their local area. Until now, benefits have helped make sure people can afford the cheapest 50 per cent of properties up for rent in their district; next October that will be reduced to the cheapest 30 per cent. From April, payments will be capped at 250 pounds ($400) per week for a one-bedroom apartment and at 400 pounds ($640) per week for a four-bedroom house.</p>
<p>If rents are higher than the cap, tenants must make up the difference  &mdash;  or leave town.</p>

		<p>Send the Asian and African parasites back to their homes and you can decide whether or not you want to subsidize white poor people with long ancestry in Britain. If deportation occurs, the budget situation will be considerably brighter.</p>

<p> WE all know that being around people not of our own race in our OWN countries, has NOT made us more tolerant!! In fact, it has made us more intolerant and frightened to see how these people really are!</p>

		<p>This article was obviously written by someone whose experience of London is limited to reading the stuff put out by tourist boards and politicians. This sentence:- &#8220;critics worry that the famously rowdy working class enclaves of London&rsquo;s east end - which gave London its defiant wartime spirit of the blitz - will fall silent..&#8221; is laughable. The east end was ethnically cleansed decades ago and very few descendants of those who lived through the blitz still live there. Social housing policies which give priority to immigrants with big families over local people ensured that they were squeezed out and replaced by foreigners from anywhere, but particularly by Bangladeshis.</p>
<p>As for this business about people of different classes and income groups living cheek by jowl - arrant nonsense.The first paragraph of the report is simply untrue and unrecognisable, the residential districts of London are very divided between rich areas and poor and always have been.</p>
<p>The only area where residential segregation is weak is race, for such is the ethnic chaos into which our capital has descended in just two generations that almost any street will show a jumble of nationalities, races, and religions from everywhere and anywhere, as well as ever-increasing numbers of the &#8220;ethnically ambiguous&#8221; who belong nowhere.</p>
<p>As for the long overdue cuts in Housing Benefit, this has been occasioned by the spectacle of huge foreign (they&rsquo;re always foreign) families being accommodated, at a cost to the taxpayer of thousands of pounds per week, in multi-million pound mansions which the people who pay the taxes could not dream of living in.<br>
The absentee owners of these palaces are invariably south Asian multi-millionaires doing very nicely out of Britain&rsquo;s crazy benefits system.  </p>

<p>$1,732 per month for a one bedroom apartment.  $2,771 for a four bedroom house.  </p>
<p>I had no idea benefits were so generous, and this is after &#8216;cutbacks&rsquo;.  Free health-care.  Free housing.  Free education.  Is there a type of food stamp or AFDC program as well?  A utilities allowance?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m living in the wrong country (U.S.).  I hurt my shoulder outside of work.  I don&rsquo;t have insurance.  I can&rsquo;t afford to get it fixed.  I can&rsquo;t afford to temporarily leave work to let it heal nor would I risk not having a job to return to.  At least I can afford lots and lots of Tylenol, generic anyway. </p>
<p>People in the third world, and much of the so-called first world, would be fools to not move to Britain and enjoy those luscious welfare benefits.     </p>

		<p>I was born in London, grew up there, and have lived there most of my life.</p>
<p>I quite agree with John Bell in England that the writer of this cretinous article has obtained his &#8220;information&#8221; from tourist board handouts, lie-spouting politicians and, I would add, white &#8220;liberal&#8221; journalists from outside the capital (provincials or foreigners who have not grown up there and do not understand the place).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rich of that fake Tory, Boris Johnson, to pontificate about &#8220;Kosovo-style social cleansing&#8221;. Quite aside from his implied stance about the relative moral merits of the claims of the indigenous Serbs and the colonising Albanians to that unfortunate region, he ignores the fact that social (and indeed ethnic) cleansing has already occurred in London. The indigenous white working class have been driven out of their own city by a combination of economic factors and mass Third-World immigration, and this has been most marked since the accession of Tony Blair&rsquo;s New Labour administration in 1997.</p>
<p>The economic factors are the exorbitant cost of living in London, including property prices or rents. State-subsidised immigrants have for the last few decades been in receipt of &#8220;no questions asked&#8221; largesse from the welfare system and the state housing bureaucracy (now largely staffed by immigrants or their white leftist vassals) which is routinely denied to the indigenous working class, or made as difficult as possible for them to obtain and kept to a bare minimum if obtained.</p>
<p>As a real Londoner I can declare that there would literally be dancing in the streets and joyful celebrations among other real Londoners (what&rsquo;s left of us) if &#8220;London&rsquo;s famed ethnic, economic and cultural mix&#8221; and its &#8220;multicultural character&#8221; were belatedly but deservedly consigned permanently to the bonfire of history.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;London&rsquo;s famed ethnic, economic and cultural mix&rdquo; [and its] &ldquo;multicultural character&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
More multikulti disinformation intended to rewrite history in favor of mass nonwhite immigration. </p>
<p>For 1000 years, London   &mdash;   like the rest of England   &mdash;   had neither an &#8220;ethnic and cultural mix&rdquo; nor a &ldquo;multicultural character.&rdquo; Before being aggressively diversificated in the postwar era England was ethnically and culturally homogenous. It was filled with nothing but (wait for it now!) ENGLISH people. </p>
<p>Throughout Britain&rsquo;s entire history up until about four decades ago, if you lived in an area of London with what this boob of a Canadian journalist calls &#8220;multicultural character&rdquo;, it meant there was a Scottish or Irish family on your block. The most exotic international population was a handful of Chinese opium smokers in the Docks area. Zero blacks. Zero Hindus. Zero Muslims. Unlike the New World, England and the rest of Europe were NOT &#8220;nations of immigrants&#8221;   &mdash;   they were nations of <i>one nationality.</i> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they called them &#8220;nations.&#8221; </p>
<p>When a journalist can&rsquo;t even get simple, basic historical facts right, there is no point in listening to anything else he might have to say. Nonsense can only beget further nonsense. <br>

		<p>I work in social housing and this week signed a woman and her four kids (all different fathers) up to a house costing £290 pw about $449 per week, her beenfits were £525 per week $813. Now what incentive does she have to get a job ?</p>
<p>Never worked, claimed allsorts of mental illnesses but was quick enough to realise that there was possibly a free parking space available and up for grabs.</p>

		<p>JasonC:  When you say benefits of $813 per week, does the $813 include housing, or is it in addition to housing?</p>
