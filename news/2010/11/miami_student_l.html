<h1>Miami Student Leader Reveals He is an Undocumented Migrant</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alfonso Chardy, Miami Herald, Nov. 18, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nineteen-year-old José Salcedo took a stand Wednesday that may turn out to be a milestone in his life and in the struggle for legalization by undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>A keynote speaker at a student rally at Miami Dade College&rsquo;s InterAmerican campus in Little Havana, Salcedo surprised many of his listeners when he revealed he was undocumented.</p>
<p>The Colombia-born Salcedo is no ordinary student. He is Student Government Association president at the InterAmerican campus, student representative on the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College and a member of the school&rsquo;s Honors College, one of 550 elite students. </p>
<p>Salcedo&rsquo;s disclosure came as some students here and across the country mobilized one day after President Obama promised to push for a DREAM Act vote in the lame-duck Congress.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Salcedo, an international law student, said he decided to reveal his lack of immigration status because he wanted to make a point about how crucial the legislation is to the future of hundreds of thousands of undocumented students like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;For 10 years I&rsquo;ve been scared to come out of the shadows,&#8221; Salcedo told the rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time I speak in public telling a crowd that I&rsquo;m undocumented.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent study by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) in Washington estimated that slightly more than 2.1 million undocumented youths could be eligible to apply for legal status under the DREAM Act if it passes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Washington, NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) warned supporters a vote on the DREAM Act was coming.</p>
<p>NumbersUSA is telling supporters to call their lawmakers and urge them to vote against the DREAM Act if the bill comes up during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>FAIR issued a statement calling the DREAM Act the &#8220;illegal alien student amnesty bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Salcedo and other undocumented students the DREAM Act is the only path they have to advance their careers in the United States.</p>
<p>Without the DREAM Act, Salcedo can&rsquo;t go very far after he graduates since he can&rsquo;t get a work permit or a green card.</p>
<p><strong>BIG DREAMS</strong></p>
<p>But if the DREAM Act passes, Salcedo has big dreams. He wants to become a citizen, join the military and become a politician. </p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to join the military and once I come back I would like to run for public office  &mdash;  mayor of the city of Miami,&#8221; Salcedo said. &#8220;Start off small and pull my way up.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7793129">Fresno State Student Body President Is Undocumented Immigrant</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>Tommy Tran, KFSN-TV (Fresno), Nov. 16, 2010</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The student body president at Fresno State has revealed a big secret with potentially life-changing consequences.</p>
<p>Pedro Ramirez now says he&rsquo;s not ashamed to admit   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s an undocumented immigrant. </p>
<p>Ramirez says for past four years he&rsquo;s had to lie about his immigration status because he was afraid of what would happen to him. But now he says he doesn&rsquo;t have to be afraid anymore. </p>
<p>Pedro Ramirez undocumented status had been a secret to his classmates and teachers. But that all changed Tuesday when the Fresno State newspaper the Collegian published this article online. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ramirez came to the United States from Mexico when he was three. He says he didn&rsquo;t find out about his illegal status until he applied for scholarships and military grants his senior year. <br/>
Having no social security card meant no federal funding. &#8220;So I just went through the college route. A lot of my counselors helped me out. They told me of the way that I can get into college without being a citizen.&#8221; added Ramirez. </p>
<p>Ramirez is receiving his education through a state bill that allows him to pay in-state tuition. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ramirez says he would have preferred to reveal his secret in a different way but fear kept him in hiding until now. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you lie or when you hold something back or you hold it in. It kind of blinds you and you don&rsquo;t know what to do. So coming out of the shadows and telling people what I am and what I&rsquo;ve been through you know it&rsquo;s a big relief for me.&#8221; said Ramirez. </p>
<p>Ramirez says he is also aware that there could be severe consequences to coming clean including the possibility of being deported. But for now, he&rsquo;s just focused on getting his degree in the spring. <br/>

		<p>This is all a coordinated media push for the DREAM Act.</p>
<p>Who are the two native born white Americans who were not admitted to Miami Dade College and Fresno State University, respectively, so that these two illegal aliens could get in?</p>

		<p>Mexico needs people like this&hellip; to remain in Mexico.  We, on the other hand, do not need him nor any other illegal entrants. Further, we do not need any other applicants for citizenship at all, period. I am convinced that the world would be a much better place if world-wide immigration were outlawed and such movement would bring about a harsh punishment.  The nations and peoples of the world need to resolve issues without the use of invasion, military or otherwise.</p>

<p><br/>
This was all predictable.  </p>
<p>First, they just want to be here. Somehow. Any way at all.<br/>
Next, they want the right to work.<br/>
Next, they want free education, health care, welfare.<br/>
Then they want drivers&rsquo; licences, Social Sec.,papers, documents, mortgages.<br/>
Then they demand citizenship. (Notice the change from <i>&#8220;want&#8221; </i>to  <i>&#8220;demand&#8221;</i> at this point.)<br/>
And then, they want to be politicians, who will tell you how to run your country and your lives. And you will be taking orders from THEM.</p>
<p>Whoever said they just wanted to come here to make beds and mow the grass?  Was that YOU, Dubya Bush? You traitorious moron!</p>

		<p>You would think that with all their education they would understand the meaning of the word &#8220;illegal&#8221;.  Instead of playing on the sympathies of American citizens they should hold their parents accountable. </p>
<p>Note to all parents:  If you are going to commit a crime please don&rsquo;t bring your children with you in hopes of throwing yourself at the mercy of the court once you are caught. By bringing your children with you not only do you suffer consequences but so does the child. You should have known that when you started down the path of sneaking into the country.</p>

		<p>Salcedo is exactly the kind of citizen Columbia needs.  </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of my counselors helped me out. They told me of the way that I can get into college without being a citizen.&#8221; stated illegal Pedro R.</p>
<p>And the swift arrest of these counselors for abetting criminal wrongdoing should follow Pedro&rsquo;s deportation. <br/>

		<p>He should be sent a BILL for the exact amount of his purloined education on the tax payer&rsquo;s backs.  While every citizen has the privilege of attending public school, he is NOT a citizen, therefore has not the privilege, and is guilty of theft of services.  Then, after paying his bill or serving some sort of incarceration and/or community service equal to that amount, he should be DEPORTED.  And oh, by the way, where did you say your parents were living?  Address please.</p>

Ironic that an international law student starts out by breaking international laws.</p>

		<p>I applaud both of these young men for coming out. I would encourage all others in similar situations to do the same. Further, I think that they should be immediately deported to their country of origin; they are here illegally, and have no right to be here. All people who are here illegally should be removed from the USA as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Here is a new tack. People like this who think it is ok to break the law is the reason places like columbia and mexico are so poor. It is because the people in general are corrupt. So Jose Salcedo just wants to be another corrupt politician. What a way to start by anouncing that you stole some native born americans place at a university. I bet his grades are inflated thanks to affirmative action. I see another Barack Obama on the Horizon. Now you know why we have been flooded with Hispanic illegals. The elites are hoping to have what the rest of the third world seems to have a president for life.</p>

		<p>Govt. could care less about immigration laws. They&rsquo;re not going to do anything and we all know that. </p>
<p>Govt. is only motivated about its direct survival. They keep their citizens in line by ensuring taxes are paid. Hey, try not paying your taxes and see what happens - except if you&rsquo;re a high ranking Democrat (Rangel). </p>

		<p>Anyone want to bet that ICE is rushing to Fresno State to arrest the invader? I&rsquo;ll also bet that orders come down from on high to ignore these lawbreakers who feel so entitled to our country. And I don&rsquo;t see anyone on the horizon who has the guts to tell the rest of the world that if we find one illegal from their country, all funds will stop. Can you hear the wails from Mexico on that one! We are their dumping ground. They get rid of their people who then send their money home and we continue to pour taxpsyer funds as well as pay for those who manage to sneak in. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want a sweet deal like that? Our leaders have become sissies who can&rsquo;t defend us against this invasion from a third world hell hole.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right about that.  Anyone who has spent some time in Latin America will know that Latins view the law as something to get around, not to obey. There is no stigma in doing this. It&rsquo;s taken for granted.  And they will obey the law only so long as there is a policeman there watching them (and he&rsquo;s usually corrupt too).  For the right payment of money, you can do anything.</p>
<p>When these people come here, they bring their social attitudes with them. Is it a surprise that any place they invade, they soon transform into a new Tijuana?</p>
<p>The anaolgy reminds me of the Middle Ages: They&rsquo;re like people fleeing the Plague. But everywhere they go, they take the Plague with them.</p>
<p>While attempting to flee their own corruption, chaos, illegitimacy, poverty  and social problems, they only spread them around.<br/>
They need to be quarantined.</p>

<p>From the first article: </p>
<p>&ldquo;For 10 years I&rsquo;ve been scared to come out of the shadows,&rdquo; Salcedo told the rally.</p>
<p><br/>
And from the second article:</p>
<p>&#8220;[C]oming out of the shadows and telling people what I am and what I&rsquo;ve been through you know it&rsquo;s a big relief for me.&rdquo; said Ramirez.</p>
<p><br/>
Notice both reports about similar situations   &mdash;   but from opposite coasts   &mdash;   describe illegal students proclaiming their illegality to the world, in terms of &#8220;coming out.&#8221;</p>
<p>As in &#8220;coming out of the closet&#8221; for gay people announcing their homosexuality.</p>
<p>So we readers will think of these students not as criminals confessing to crimes   &mdash;   which is what they are   &mdash;   but rather as poor, downtrodden victims of a bigoted majority who are doing something brave by &#8220;coming out&#8221; and &#8220;finally being honest&#8221; and &#8220;no longer hiding in the shadows&#8221; and so on. </p>
<p>I guess the MSM have all decided that the terminology of &#8220;coming out&#8221; worked so well for the Gay Rights movement, that it will also work for the Open Borders movement. </p>
<p>I eagerly await the day when the MSM gives sympathetic coverage to some serial killer &#8220;coming out&#8221; about all the corpses he has stuffed into his crawlspace. I&rsquo;m sure the admission will be very therapeutic for all involved. </p>
