<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Researchers found that how successfully an individual operates in a group is as much down to having the right genetic make-up as it is to having common cultural ties with fellow group members.</p>
<p>After assessing nearly 1000 pairs of adult twins, researchers at the University of Edinburgh found that strong genetic influences have a major influence on how loyal a person feels to their social group.It also has a significant impact on how flexibly they can adapt group membership.</p>
<p>Family ties were less influential. Instead factors outside the family such as ethnicity and religion seem to account for the environmental influences that determine how successfully a group will operate.</p>
<p>To assess the influence of genetics, scientists asked the twins a series of questions about how important it was for them that people with whom they are affiliated share their religion, ethnicity or race.</p>
<p>They found that identical twins  &mdash;  who share all their genes  &mdash;  gave very similar responses, whereas non-identical twins were much more likely to differ in their answers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they found that being part of a strong religious group made subjects less likely to emphasise ethnic and racial influence when deciding with which coalitions they become involved, regardless of genetics.</p>
<p>Professor Timothy Bates, of the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, who led the research, said: &#8220;The success of a coalition reflects the genetic make-up of the group members as well as cultural factors such as and shared goals, beliefs, and traditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>This research could be applied to investigate affiliation in areas such as work, sport and the military.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, which is the first to examine the impact of both genetics and environment on how people form groups, is published in Psychological Science journal.<br>

		<p>&#8220;They found that identical twins &mdash; who share all their genes &mdash; gave very similar responses, whereas non-identical twins were much more likely to differ in their answers&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is incredible. Identical twins, who often share the same cribs, have a special language just among themselves, and often answer at the exact same time, they are very likely to give &#8216;similar responses&rsquo;?</p>
<p>This is science? The multicult has stooped to a new low in order to report favorably on their agenda.</p>

		<p>This study doesn&rsquo;t really come as a surprise, to those of us in the know. It will infuriate multiculturalists and diversity lovers, though.</p>
<p>People want to be around others of their own kind. It&rsquo;s when governments get involved, that the problems begin.</p>

Researchers found that how successfully an individual operates in a group is as much down to having the right genetic make-up as it is to having common cultural ties with fellow group members.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Of course.  Because the most basic, driving, instinct behind social altruism is the functional effect it has on one&rsquo;s ability to project forwards one&rsquo;s own genetic factors through breeding rights.  And those who look like you are more likely to include those capabilities which make you functionally superior at the environmentally dictated roles you have Darwinistically been selected to succeed in.</p>
<p>Even suicidal altruism in an affinity group that at least nominally shares -some- of your genetic makeup is at least giving an &#8216;extended family&rsquo; benefit based on last common ancestry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Family ties were less influential. Instead factors outside the family such as ethnicity and religion seem to account for the environmental influences that determine how successfully a group will operate.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Family ties only bind so long as their influence on social economic state matches to the selfish survival benefits they provide to immature children and juveniles.  Grow up and suddenly being locked within a family group is a dead end to your genetics.</p>
<p>Why do you think whites often go so far in migrating away from their parents &#8216;domain&rsquo; as State as much as city residency?  It&rsquo;s because you want to plant your seed in an _unrelated_ genetic group for which common degrees of &#8216;whiteness&rsquo; still implies a success ratio sufficient to make it a good investment.</p>
<p>I bet blacks in Africa and East Asians are much the same, just going by different racial sub-features that help them identify tribal sub-regions.</p>
<p>Until it is socially suppressed, all children have an -excellent- ability to define ethnic differences, even to the extent of putting fat with thin over white with brown.</p>
<p>All by the time we are three or so.</p>
<p>We lose the urgency of that explicit identity by the time we are in our early 20s but by the time we are 15, our affinity patterns have stabilized in the groups we like to be with rather than the publically stated &#8216;non preference&rsquo; we maintain a public hypocrisy of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we are bigots for living together it&rsquo;s that our leaders present a false image that we have no reason to be and are somehow &#8216;letting down the group&rsquo; by doing so.  And that&rsquo;s just not true.  Look at the Galapagos and tell me why genetic isolation is not a good thing for refining new species benefits in protected periphery endo-groups.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Interestingly, they found that being part of a strong religious group made subjects less likely to emphasise ethnic and racial influence when deciding with which coalitions they become involved, regardless of genetics.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Religions are transcendental submission psychology enforcement schemes.  They have always had that &#8216;rapture&rsquo; effect on the dumb, the poor and the socially dispossessed.  And what is a transcendental mental state if not a solid alpha rhythm that merges left:right brain hemisphere functioning and disrupts rational cognition of problems, rules and opportunities.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think about what you really want, what you are really comfortable with.  Just go with the flow.</p>
<p>Slaves are made this way&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; <br>
&ldquo;The success of a coalition reflects the genetic make-up of the group members as well as cultural factors such as and shared goals, beliefs, and traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This research could be applied to investigate affiliation in areas such as work, sport and the military.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is just another excuse for developmental psychologists to stick their ugly experimentalist ideas into our kids heads at ages when their instinctive behavior patterns have not hardened and thus increase the likelihood of disrupting natural, effective and ultimately _rational_ development of affinity group preferences.</p>
<p>Because where knowledge is king and knowledge of the DNA limitations of developmental IQ and social conformity potential of certain racial groups is anathema to rendering them &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; within a globalist consumer plutarchy, what our kids are prevented from imprinting as preferential behaviors early on will make them just as stupid, within a few generations of miscegenation.</p>
<p>Our leaders want malleable peons.  Not intelligent rulers of their own destiny.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The study, which is the first to examine the impact of both genetics and environment on how people form groups, is published in Psychological Science journal.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s conclusions are held safely behind ivory walled barriers to public dissemination of the truth&hellip;</p>

		<p>Over the past few months, I have become convinced that there is indeed such a thing as group selection in addition to kin selection.  While kin selection is rather straightforward as a strategy, group selection is controversial and seems so much more complicated and perhaps a bit fuzzy. </p>
<p>There seems, however, to be one significant factor in group selection and that is relatedness; and since altruism cannot survive if it is directed to competing groups, and since the trait must also be propagated, it must be reserved to the altruist&rsquo;s particular race or ethnicity.</p>
