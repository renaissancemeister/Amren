			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Weiner, Orlando Sentinel, November 7, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As many as 14 armed Orange County deputies, including narcotics agents, stormed Strictly Skillz barbershop during business hours on a Saturday in August, handcuffing barbers in front of customers during a busy back-to-school weekend.</p>
<p>It was just one of a series of unprecedented raid-style inspections the Orange County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office recently conducted with a state regulating agency, targeting several predominantly black- and Hispanic-owned barbershops in the Pine Hills area.</p>
<p>In &#8220;sweeps&#8221; on Aug. 21 and Sept. 17 targeting at least nine shops, deputies arrested 37 people  &mdash;  the majority charged with &#8220;barbering without a license,&#8221; a misdemeanor that state records show only three other people have been jailed in Florida in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The operations were conducted without warrants, under the authority of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation inspectors, who can enter salons at will. Deputies said they found evidence of illegal activity, including guns, drugs and gambling. However, records show that during the two sweeps, and a smaller one in October, just three people were charged with anything other than a licensing violation.</p>
<p>Orange County sheriff&rsquo;s Capt. Dave Ogden, who commands the area that includes Pine Hills, described the operations as a &#8220;minuscule&#8221; part of a larger effort to snuff out crime in one of Central Florida&rsquo;s notorious hot spots.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>No ordinary inspection?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barbers and witnesses at several shops told the Orlando Sentinel that deputies shouted and cursed during the raids, demanding the location of illegal drugs, which they searched for extensively. They never found more than misdemeanor amounts of marijuana at eight of the nine shops they raided.</p>
<p>The lone exception: Just Blaze on Semoran Boulevard in Apopka, where an arrest report shows deputies found Ski Joseph Vasquez, 40, with &#8220;2 baggies of cocaine in a prescription bottle&#8221; and cutting agents in the barbershop&rsquo;s office during the Sept. 17 sweep. Vasquez was arrested on drug- and gun-related charges after deputies said they found a handgun in his car.</p>
<p>On the same day, deputies raided two other barbershops and found no illegal activity other than unlicensed barbering. And besides the arrest at Just Blaze, reports show the two sweeps turned up the following: evidence of gambling, equipment &#8220;that appeared to be used&#8221; to make pirated DVDs and CDs, &#8220;some sort of tax service,&#8221; two handguns and misdemeanor amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Cornerstone of the community&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>To those who live in the communities they serve, these barbershops are more than places to get a haircut.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the centers of political discourse and political organization in black communities,&#8221; said Melissa Harris-Perry, professor of African-American studies at Princeton University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said by violating the barbershop&rsquo;s role as a &#8220;safe place&#8221; in the black community, deputies may have placed the community&rsquo;s trust in local law enforcement at risk. &#8220;It&rsquo;s exactly counterproductive,&#8221; she said, adding that targeting minority barbershops sends a message about &#8220;which communities deserve to be disrupted and which don&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Bishop Kelvin L. Cobaris of Empowerment Ministries Church of Pine Hills defended the actions of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. He said deputies have been effective in reducing crime in the area, and if the searches were legal and criminal activity was discovered, the deputies&rsquo; approach to entering the shops &#8220;shouldn&rsquo;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Criminal barbering?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Florida Department of Law Enforcement records turned up only 38 jail bookings on the misdemeanor charge across the entire state in the past 10 years  &mdash;  and all but three of those arrests occurred during Orange County operations during the past few months.</p>
<p>Most of the barbers charged with licensing violations as a result of the sheriff&rsquo;s operation pleaded no contest and were ordered to pay fines of about $500  &mdash;  which is about equal to the ones inspectors issue when a barber or stylist has an expired license.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A history of noncompliance?</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In terms of demographics, the shops had clear similarities: Their clientele, owners and staff were predominantly black or Hispanic, and all were located in or near high-crime areas.</p>
<p>And, although the Orange County barbershop raids were unprecedented in Florida, they&rsquo;re not the first of their kind.</p>
<p>Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the city of Moreno Valley, Calif., among others, after authorities conducted what the civil-rights group described in its complaint as &#8220;a series of raid-style searches&#8221; of black barbershops.</p>

		<p>Mixed feelings on this article. On the surface it seems silly, but then again unlicensed barbers handle razors and clippers. Unlicensed means no training regarding sanitation.</p>
<p>Would you want an unlicensed barber shaving your face or neck with unsanity razors/clippers used on an HIV infected black 10 minutes before? Okay, so none of us would be in a place like that to begin with, but we will pay their health care bills if they get infected. My dog got a nasty case of Sarcoptic mange from a pair of clippers that were not sanitized by the groomer, it is not a good thing.</p>

		<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t they send out an inspector from the governing municipality to check-up and fine scofflaws? This sounds like huge waste of resources and the furthering of an encroaching police state.   </p>

		<p>Blacks will accuse the police of racism, which will be odd considering that the Orange County Sheriff is black.  His wife, also black, is Orlando Police Chief.  Don&rsquo;t ask me how that situation happened.  </p>
<p>Orlando used to be a sleepy town without much action.  Coinciding more or less with the Disney arrival, and in conjunction with Puerto Rican in-migration, certain areas are a no-go zone  &mdash;  all black/Hispanic neighborhoods.      </p>

		<p>This is stupid.  Anyplace where blacks congregate, are not doing serious criminal activity and keeps them busy should be left alone.  If anything we need more barbershops for them to hang out in, like those old white guys who sometimes hang out in them.</p>

		<p>Barbershops have to be licensed because of health concerns. Barbers deal with the human body and chemicals and sanitary means of using sharp object in the presence of your flesh.</p>
<p>Barbering too has been a &#8220;trade&#8221; long taught in the prisons as a means for men released to make it on the outside.</p>
<p>These shops are an excellent cover for released men to cover illegal activities on the outside?</p>

		<p>Notice all the hand-wringing over the treatment of these poor barbershops in this MSM article. Yes, it did quote Bishop Kelvin L. Cobaris, who defended the actions of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (simply to create the impression of some kind of balance). Yet the overall tone of this article  &mdash;  entirely invented, of course  &mdash;  is that this was a nefarious case of &#8220;police profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>To those who live in the communities they serve, these barbershops are more than places to get a haircut. They are the centers of political discourse and political organization in black communities,&rdquo; said Melissa Harris-Perry, professor of African-American studies at Princeton University.</i></p>
<p>Interesting. And didn&rsquo;t we read in a recent article on Amren that barbering is one of the most common professions in the black community? Now this article, if you read between the lines verrrrry carefully, seems to imply that many black barbershops are fronts for &#8220;political action&#8221; (and maybe even drug dealing).</p>
<p>Methinks there&rsquo;s a lot more here than meets the eye.</p>

		<p>Actually, I side with the black business owners in this case. The state has no business telling someone they need a license to cut someone&rsquo;s hair who willing comes to get their hair done. They should pay taxes and be left the hell alone. If they are involved in drugs, investigate for that.</p>

A couple years ago, a Hispanic barber shop opened in my neighborhood. It was populated by shady looking young men who hung around all day. They didn&rsquo;t keep regular hours either. They were open late into the night and they were just hanging out and not cutting hair.</p>
<p>I was suspicious and I told the police officer who attends our block club meeting and he was very interested.</p>
<p>Before the police did any investigation, the place closed and emptied out over night so nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p>I told a friend of mine about it and he told me that he was visiting a friend of his on the Hispanic west side. When he was leaving, his friend told him not to wait at the bus stop in front of the Hispanic barber shop because it was a known drug operation.</p>
<p>I suspect there are a few drug businesses being run out of black and Hispanic barber shops. AR reported on the high number of black barbers and this may be part of the explanation.</p>

		<p>Why not simply record 15 minutes of the barbershop on tape, then have them arrested for a violation of hate crime laws? Would seem an easy way to make an arrest for &#8216;hate&rsquo; at any time in any black barbershop in the nation, if they were serious about hate laws and not simply interested in keeping the white man down. </p>

		<p>All you&rsquo;re seeing here is the People&rsquo;s Republic of California making a show of force to prevent more &#8220;unlicensed barbers&#8221; from depriving the State of its revenue.</p>
<p>1 - Sonya</p>
<p>Licensing does not mean training, and training does not mean action.  The State of California does not guarantee that your licensed barber is following proper hygiene.  It does guarantee a larger portion of what you pay for a haircut goes to the State of California to provide services to criminal aliens.</p>
<p>Licensing is really a joke.  It fills the coffers of the state and limits the pool of professionals practicing a given profession, just like trade unions.  What licensing does not do is guarantee your doctor won&rsquo;t prescribe medication that will kill you, your surgeon won&rsquo;t sew you back up with instruments in your body, or your barber sterilizes his clippers and razors.</p>

		<p>RE # 3 Mr. Anymouse, How can you tar such a wonderful place of magic and fantasy as Orlando/ Orange County/ Florida. No go zones in Orange County,how can that be? They must not have any crime or poverty there since they just beggared the next two generations selling 650,000,000 worth of bonds for a play pen for baby making machines with tats and posses and the richest spectators this side of the front row at the Garden with Spike Lee. Pine Hills where these dangerous barbers were bagged is not a no go zone, it is a no fly zone. Jet air liners avoid it so they won`t be hit by stray AK-47 fire or collide with the constant air armada of police helicopters chasing fleeing dope dealers, killers, and phoney manicurists. It leads America in ear plug sales, because nobody can sleep without them do to the 24 hours a day screaming from victims and warning sirens from cop cars and ambulences. A special deputy protection program was created last week around the house of a parapelegic blind war veteren named John Brownlee. He is Pine Hills`s most valuable citizen. He is the last living white man still staying there. When he gets murdered most likely by next Friday, Pine Hills will be the blackest place on Earth this side of Mogadishu.<br/>

		<p>While the raids might sound silly on the surface, if these barber shops are so &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;clean&#8221;, why didn&rsquo;t the proprietors just get licensed?  Yes, the licensing fees are intended to provide revenue to the state and/or municipal governments, which are terribly fiscally strained these days (which means not having a license is just begging for trouble).  Even if these barber shops were not drug fronts, or maybe especially if they were not drug fronts, it behooved them to follow the rules, just like it behooves the rest of us to actually have drivers&rsquo; licenses before we get behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t knowingly break the law and then cry &#8220;Poor little black me.&#8221;  That song is so old we all know the words to it by heart.</p>

		<p>First of all, who cares if those shops are safe and clean? The only people who go to those shops are Blacks. Let them decide if those businesses are up to their standards. </p>
<p>Secondly, did Blacks finally stop raping, robbing, murdering, selling dope, stealing cars, writing bad checks and packing illegal weapons in Orange County? Have things become so peaceful and pleasant in that area that bored cops have to raid unlicensed barber shops to justify their employment?</p>
<p>Give Blacks half a chance and they will give the police plenty of legitimate reasons to put them in a cage. Cops don&rsquo;t need to waste their time on outlaw barbers.</p>

		<p>Perhaps had the barber shop been run by illegal aliens, the police would have left them alone   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t crack down on illegal aliens, don&rsquo;t you know!  Still, this case does have the element of absurdism to it, all those cops over a clip joint. </p>

		<p>I see a lot of clueless posts on this one.  These places are hosts for gambling big time.  Also drugs.  The &#8220;licensing&#8221; angle is a pretext for the cops to snoop around without a warrant.</p>
<p>When I lived in Washington Heights, NYC, I went to Dominican barbershops many times.  Exact same thing.  People coming &amp; going all the time.  No haircuts for them.</p>
<p>Some of these business owners maybe didn&rsquo;t &#8220;pay the man&#8221;.  Just saying.</p>
