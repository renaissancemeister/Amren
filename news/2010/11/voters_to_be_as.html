			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerri Peev, Daily Mail (London), Nov. 16, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voters will have to give their date of birth, supply a signature and national insurance number before they can register to take part in the next election in a clamp down on widespread electoral fraud.</p>
<p>Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, will set out tough new measures for voter identification in a keynote speech today.</p>
<p>He will warn that the political system has fallen &#8216;dangerously out of step&rsquo; with life in Britain and that politics remains &#8216;closed, remote, elite&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Clegg will announce a new bill on constitutional reform to sort out the chaotic electoral register.</p>
<p>He will say: &#8216;People must have confidence in the system, and know that it is secure against fraud. So we are committed to tackling fraud by speeding up the move to individual  &mdash;  as opposed to household  &mdash;  registration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>New security measures will be in place by 2014, in time for the next general election.</p>
<p>The previous government had planned to delay tougher rules until after polling day.</p>
<p>Every voter will have to register themselves, provide a signature, national insurance number and date of birth.</p>
<p>The move is expected to clean up the electoral fraud witnessed in areas such as Tower Hamlets, where thousands of bogus voters appeared on the roll weeks before the general election.</p>
<p>Labour supporters were accused of packing the electoral roll with relatives living overseas or inventing phantom voters.</p>
<p>Mr Clegg will warn that the government would still have to deal with the millions of people who are not on the electoral register.</p>
<p>Around 3.5 million have slipped off the role  &mdash;  more than the populations of Greater Manchester and Birmingham put together.</p>
<p>In the annual Political Studies Association/Hansard Society lecture in London, Mr Clegg will say:&rsquo;The Coalition Government is clear: these missing millions must be given back their voice.  There is no magic wand solution; but, equally, there is no excuse for inaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From next year local authorities will compare other databases to the electoral register to identify missing voters.</p>
<p>Mr Clegg will say: &#8216;We&rsquo;ve already launched the process, and local authorities are bidding now to run schemes to test what works best. </p>
<p>&#8216;Council officers will be able help these people to get on the register. And, if it works, it could be rolled out across the rest of the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The problem of slipping off the register is worst among the young, black and ethnic minority communities and in poorer areas.</p>
<p>Mr Clegg will signal that voting would never be compulsory the way it is in countries such as Australia, saying registration would always be down to individual choice.</p>
<p>More frequent boundary reviews will also be unveiled to end the &#8216;outdated, haphazard arrangements we inherited from Labour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>An attempt by Labour to scupper the coalition government&rsquo;s plans for a boundary shake up was narrowly defeated yesterday by just 14 votes.</p>
<p>The government overturned Labour&rsquo;s attempts to delay the planned redrawing of constituencies, which is tied to a referendum on changing the voting system in the knife-edge vote in House of Lords.</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s ex Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, had argued that because the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill protected the constituency boundaries of the Western Isles and Orkney and the Shetlands, it was &#8216;hybrid&rsquo; and had to be referred to a panel of parliamentary clerks.</p>
<p>If the clerks had ruled that the Bill was hybrid  &mdash;  which means it applies to a specific group differently than to the general public  &mdash;  the timetable for the referendum on the Alternative Vote system would have been thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Ministers are intent on holding the referendum next May, despite warnings from the Electoral Commission that the timetable is already slipping.<br>

Before the election, c-span did an interview with one of those voter advocacy groups that is trying to remove all standards for voter registration.</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t want any proof of any kind to vote. Any requirements to vote are seen as either racist or disenfranchising the poor. </p>
<p>They want universal provisional voting; anyone can vote and legitimate votes are supposed to be sorted out after the election.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the chance that any votes would be deemed illegitimate? Zero. Even if proof of residency or identity couldn&rsquo;t be established, I have no doubt they would be counted as legitimate.</p>

		<p>The UK has a problem we here in the US are only now broaching.  They are in danger of disappearing as a distinct people.  Also, it is even worse.  When they talk about &#8220;Asians&#8221;, they are really saying muslims from such areas as Pakistan.  So not only are they losing their cultural identity, they are losing their rights to live as Westerners, destined to be under Sharia Law, a pending death sentence.</p>

		<p>In UK we register to pay &#8216;council tax&rsquo; which is levied on all property with graduated payment  &#8216;bands&rsquo; which reflect the size/value of the property. This tax covers police, waste collection, schools and a host of other local public services. At the same time we also register to vote in local and national elections. We have a list of registered, eligible electors mailed to each household but just before an election each individual person receives an electors eligibility card which is supposed to be produced at the polling station as proof. The amazing thing is that there is no requirement to actually produce the card as the officials simply ask for name and address, rule through their list of eligible electors and hand over a ballot paper. This is stupid and fraught with fraud opportunities as once a ballot paper is issued to anyone quoting my name and even if I then later attend with my polling card, I am told I have already cast my ballot as my name is crossed off their list! In muslim families, the male head of the household will collect all the cards and cast his ballot several times. No one objects as it is culturally acceptable for women not to attend this public event and cast votes themselves so the husband/father does it for them! This is democracy gone crazy and why the now outed labour party promoted postal ballots for the millions of unskilled non-English speaking pakistani and bangladeshi immigrants they encouraged to enter UK in preference to educated immigrants from elsewhere. There is no need for this &#8220;Every voter will have to register themselves, provide a signature, national insurance number and date of birth&#8221; because White, English legal voters will have already done this. The mere idea that ..&#8221;The problem of slipping off the register is worst among the young, black and ethnic minority communities and in poorer areas&#8221;.. is because most are illegal or incompetent and do not register because they then evade paying council tax! This electoral mess is simply racist against the White English population as they will be targeted when, in fact, they are already legally registered and the immigrants and their families will be granted exemptions because we are told we must &#8216;celebrate our multi-cultural diversity&rsquo; whether want it or not or even it means a change in our long established English law to accomplish it.</p>

		<p>As pointed out by #2 anon, these &#8220;Asians&#8221; are Pakistani and other muslims and NOT Asians. Far better Asians than Pakistanis or other muslims. Heathrow Airport is run by Pakistani muslims and CDG in Paris is run by muslim African blacks&hellip;total chaos going through either of those the last few times through each for me. Muslims cannot run their own countries and they want to run Western, civilized and productive societies!!!! Say good bye to all of that and say hello to sharia and escalating violence and atrocities against non muslims and whites.</p>
