			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles D. Ellison, Huffington Post, November 22, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the past two weeks, one could make the argument that African American politicians are somehow under siege.</p>
<p>With Republicans headed into a majority, the four Congressional Black Caucus Members lose Chairmanships over powerful House committees. Eighteen will give up subcommittee Chairs. {snip}</p>
<p>Founding CBC Member Rep. Charlie Rangel&rsquo;s (D-NY) ethics trial ends up in an embarrassing vote for censure. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) will be next to face the House Ethics Committee gavel. Two others, Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) and Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), are in the immediate inquiry pipeline.</p>
<p>There is a larger issue of waning Black political influence nationwide. Much of it is simple partisan calculus: most Black elected officials are staunch Democrats, and there are few either willing or in an able position to leverage relationships on the other side of the aisle. Loss of 19 state legislatures to Republicans, who now wield the ruthless magic wand of redistricting, poses a political life-and-death scenario to the 630 Black and mostly Democratic state legislators spread throughout the fifty states. That also poses a problem to CBC Members enjoying safe majority-Black districts. Some are nervous they could lose seats to a happily gerrymandering GOP.</p>
<p>Even on the Republican side  &mdash;  and despite major gains for the party on Nov. 2nd  &mdash;  a chorus of GOP elected officials are calling for the resignation of Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele, the party&rsquo;s first Black chair. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} While their White Democratic colleagues might be resigned to it, licking wounds from electoral losses, the stakes are higher for the Black Members who represent a larger community in desperate need of real political influence.</p>
<p>The uncomfortable jolt of reality is already spurring bold bids for Ranking Members positions on major Committees as Black Members find their bearing. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black political power and influence appears somehow strafed and in serious condition since the midterm elections. Even President Barack Obama is not immune as he fends off assaults from both left and right, including a Washington Post column by two prominent Democratic strategists recommending he pass on reelection in 2012. A combination of scandal, Republican electoral tsunamis and lack of coordinated response to the new political climate have left Black politicos trapped in a smoky wilderness of uncertainty. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} After rapid maturation over the past 40 years, course correction is essential as African American politicians evolve. However, we have not arrived, yet, and we cannot act as though we have  &mdash;  high unemployment numbers, foreclosure rates, disproportionate public health indicators and the inability of many to afford a college education speaks to that. {snip}<br>

		<p>The republicans have a choice this year.  Either immediately start advocating intensely for white interests or watch as the federal government is first nullified, then defunded and finally dissolved by the states.</p>
<p>In real terms that means MONEY.  Republicans need to cut most of the funding to non-whites now.  Or that money will be taken away from them&hellip;.maybe even the US dollar abandoned.  More likely what the US dollar IS will change drastically as the fed is dissolved, national debt is defaulted on and spending severely restricted.</p>
<p>This agenda is already well advanced with large numbers of key politicians in place to make it happen.</p>
<p>No joke.</p>

		<p>If the Republicans were smart, they would gerrymander as many heavily black Congressional and state legislative seats as possible.  This would actually hurt white liberals and white Democrats, because with blacks &#8220;ghettoized&#8221; in their own districts, white liberals have no natural constituency outside of a few rare pockets.  Almost all white Congressional districts would be Republican.  So it would mean black power would increase, but it would increase within an increasingly ineffectual Democrat Party.</p>

		<p>One can only pray that the Republicans will use their majority to gerrymander House districts as do the Democrats - but I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it. &#8220;We must reach across the aisle,&#8221; don&rsquo;t you know.</p>
<p>The present day Republicans are an utterly useless political party, always throwing away the fruits of victory and &#8220;reaching across the aisle,&#8221; even as their opponents sneer at them and hold them in boundless contempt. </p>

		<p>Charles Ellison complains blacks haven&rsquo;t arrived at a time the black grip on power in the House seems to be lax. In fact, Charles, all the chairmanships generated was prestige and inflated salary gravy for some HBC grads as highly paid staffers, but black unemployment soars as whites care less and less about affirmative action and Latinos and Chinese gobble up available jobs with little guilt about blacks. I guess some of those staffers now can clean hotel rooms and cut the bushes and lawns of wealthy Liberals in Potomac, MD.</p>
<p>What would you have the nation do, Charles? Give every black a high paid job and a free college education? </p>
<p>Of course. </p>

		<p>This fear of blacks representatives being gerrymandered out of their districts is baseless. Maybe the blacks in question are not familiar with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  As applied, this law forces state legislatures to create &#8220;majority minority&#8221; districts, and forces them not to &#8220;retrogress&#8221; after they have created them.  That is, once a safe black district is created, it cannot be undone.</p>
<p>One outcome of this process is the endangerment of white Democrats.  As black districts are maximized, the other districts become whiter and more Republican.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with politics knows this.  The people who put this blather in the Huffington Post are either liars or ignoramuses.</p>

		<p> It is to be devoutly hoped that Republican-controlled legislatures will gerrymander some of the black congressmen out of the black-majority districts they were gerrymandered into by Democrats years ago.</p>
<p> Whites are certainly not guaranteed a congressman of their own race; Hispanics are not ensured their congressman will be Spanish-speaking; Asian-Americans get no ethnic guarantees in the House. But blacks do, in areas where there is a large enough concentration of them so that a &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; black seat can be ginned up.</p>
<p> Blacks are &#8220;in desperate need of real political influence&#8221;? As if no one else is? And of course the implication there is that a White (or Hispanic, or Asian) representative would deliberately not act in blacks&rsquo; best interests if he were representing them. That&rsquo;s a contemptible slur.</p>

<p>Only fair. That&rsquo;s how Blacks and Dems got into power (even as they falsely claimed this too was to their disadvantage). The whole dang country has been &#8216;redistricted&rsquo;. Whites have pretty much been redistricted out of their own country.  </p>

		<p>Since a pretty significant number of the black elected officials at least at the national level owe their election to court sponsored and approved gerrymandering, it should only be apparent that a true and fair district with boundary lines drawn in a normal manner would mean fewer blacks elected to office. But then - - that might be fair! </p>

<p>Notice how when Republicans hold the state legislatures it&rsquo;s a &#8220;ruthless magic wand&#8221;. Somehow I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d be calling it that if the Dems held the majority of the legislatures.</p>
<p><i>Some are nervous they could lose seats to a happily gerrymandering GOP.</i></p>
<p>Who are they kidding! The only reason they have those seats is because of gerrymandering. What makes them nervous is that the GOP will UNgerrymander the districts.</p>

		<p>Frankly, I think the general population has finally had enough of black underachievement and criminality, and the endless, increasingly creative, far-fetched excuses for it. The money has run out, and the nonsense must stop. The purpose of a black politician is to funnel goodies to the &#8220;black community,&#8221; and when the supply of goodies is stretched to the limit black politicians have no political influence anymore.</p>

		<p>I wonder why they would fear Rep. State Legislatures &#8220;gerrymandering&#8221; them out of power, when they originally got elected by Dem. Legislatures &#8220;gerrymandering&#8221; them into office in the first place?<br>
It&rsquo;s time to draw up realistic voting districts, and get rid of all the convoluted zoning the Dems have done to ensure that congress meets with their diversity requirements.<br>

		<p>Blacks have painted themselves into a political corner, gerrymandered off into majority-black districts from which the vast majority of black pols are elected.  Oftentimes, Republicans are satisfied merely leaving them there, ghettoized into Democratic concentrations from which GOP districts remain free from threatening bloc voting.  Repubs may toss blacks one sop-like district and keep several mostly non-black.  <br>
Blacks, of course, would have little representation as an ethnic group without gerrymandering.  Even one of the two new black GOP Representatives beat a black Dem.  Most blacks don&rsquo;t want to compete on an equal footing with whites.  They want handouts of Congressional seats, even to the point where Pelosi created a whole new position for Jim Clyburn, who was apparently about to lose to Steny Hoyer in his bid to be minority whip.  Clyburn was apparently concerned with losing his big office and chauffered limo.   </p>

		<p>Yes, if there are any blacks or hispanics reading this or any leftists, I do want the GOP and other whites to kick them out of office.  They use their positions of power to give entitlements to their own kind and screw over whites.  So yes, I do want blacks to have their privileges and victimhood status revoked forever.</p>

<p>Wow, it sounds as if the Black politicos have managed to turn their place in the Congress into a minor version of Zimbabwe or Detroit. Just like everything this self-destructive race &ldquo;enriches,&rdquo; a &ldquo;smoky wilderness&rdquo; is the result when the party is over. Of course, the Republicans (a political metaphor for whites here) are to blame for their failures, simply because they managed to play by the rules and excelled at them in this election cycle. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Is Black Political Power Under Siege?&#8221;</p>
<p>I certainly hope black political power is under seige, and that it can be successfully contained.</p>
<p>It is the dull-witted blacks in Congress who make a bigger mess of things than the average white politician.</p>
<p>Besides thinking that too many people on one side of an island will tip it over, and their obvious hatred of America and whites, they offer absolutely NOTHING useful and contribute heavily to dumbing down the process.</p>
<p>Their constant whining and their bias in favor of blacks all over the world over their countrymen and country, creates a climate of distrust, as most all of them come across as nothing more than seditionists.</p>
