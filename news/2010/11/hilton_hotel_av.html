			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Wardrop, London Telegraph, November 9, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the Hilton Hotel chain&rsquo;s most exclusive residences avoided employing black staff in jobs where they would be &#8220;visible to the public&#8221;, an employment tribunal heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Jamaican-born Juliette Giscombe accused managers at the Hilton on Park Lane in Mayfair, London, of racial discrimination after she was repeatedly refused promotion.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old, who is the mother of comedian Richard Blackwood, claimed that black people were not allowed to work in front-of-house positions.</p>
<p>She alleged that she was forced out of her job last year at the five-star hotel after 10 years of being &#8220;unable to progress&#8221; from a telephonist position.</p>
<p>The mother-of-two said she that after six years under a &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221;, she repeatedly complained but was never taken seriously by the hotel human resources department.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the period of time I was complaining, there were no senior black members of staff in front-of-house positions,&#8221; Mrs Giscombe told the Central London Employment Tribunal.</p>
<p>&#8220;My observation of my time there was that the respondents did not recruit black staff to the front-of-house positions where they would be visible to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;I became increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress with the respondent. I had been with the respondent for six years and remained in the same position I started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found myself unable to progress. I could not understand why this was. I can only assume that it was in relation to my race.</p>
<p>&#8220;They could not conceive of a black person doing anything other than a menial role. They did invest in staff, providing they were white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Giscombe, from Streatham, south London, said she landed the job in 1999 but she was repeatedly passed over for promotion while younger, white colleagues moved up the career ladder, many of whom she had trained.</p>
<p>She claimed that as a result, other members of staff looked down on her and that one taunted her with &#8220;abusive language&#8221;.</p>
<p>This environment led to her suffering depression and she was signed off sick for several months between 2006 and 2008, the tribunal heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was signed off work with stress, anxiety and depression,&#8221; said Mrs Giscombe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also had a number of bereavements in my family between 2006 and 2008 but received little sympathy from work.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that on one occasion she was attending her father&rsquo;s body at a funeral parlour when her manager insisted she come in to work.</p>
<p>Breaking down in tears, Mrs Giscombe said: &#8220;I recall an incident after the death of my father. Whilst I was attending his body at the funeral parlour I received a phone call from the front office manager who ordered me to return to work immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I was at the funeral parlour. His response was that he had a business to run and wanted me to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>On another occasion, she was allegedly humiliated by being asked to provide valid proof of her immigration status despite being a British Citizen.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;The request was not made to non-white staff. At this stage I had worked for the company for almost 10 years. I was a British citizen so why were they questioning my right to work in the UK?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Giscombe is suing Hilton for age and race discrimination as well as constructive dismissal and is seeking Â£60,000 for loss of earnings and injury to feelings.</p>
<p>The hotel denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The hearing continues.<br>

		<p>It is just unbelievable. </p>
<p>They have without any proofs or tests just said all people would be the same, same beautiful, same intelligent, same behavior independent from race and heritage.</p>
<p>There is nothing, nowhere what works with this theory. At no subject in no city in this world race-blindness works. And liberals are not thinking just even one second about maybe this theory could be wrong. Instead whites are evil racists.<br>
That is their answer to everything.</p>
<p>I can only assure you this: Here in Germany the media and the politicians are the same, but not the people. No matter where there is a news and people can comment it, the comments are race-realistic and anti multicultural. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago a swiss newspaper noticed in an article that the German trust in their news is completely lost -maybe forever. &#8220;In some topics, they can&rsquo;t publish any article without being completely destructed in the comment-sector.&#8221; And I really noticed it. Comments like <br>
  &mdash;  &#8220;Yeah right, blacks can run faster because they are training harder. Who believes that&#8221;  &mdash;   or <br>
  &mdash;  &#8220;So we (whites) are to blame because Africans are today not as educated as they were before of the colonization (irony)&#8221;  &mdash;  <br>
are becoming normal. I think the time is changing.</p>

		<p>What has happened to the fundemental right for an employer (you know, the guy that PAYS the wages) being able to hire and fire who they want to and allocate staff to where they choose.</p>
<p>Some time ago one of my daughters, blond and blue eyes, was allocated a position very much in the public view with a major employee. Yes she did get the position because of her appearance as well as ability. White privilege? Not really, my daughter had enough brains to make the most of her appearance as well as do the job. Yes,and ha ha, it made me feel good also!</p>

		<p>Could it be that the poor old black lady wasn&rsquo;t qualified to be promoted. No, it must have been age or racial discrimination.  And just imagine<br>
 &ldquo;I also had a number of bereavements in my family between 2006 and 2008 but received little sympathy from work.&rdquo;<br>
Since when is sympathy require from employers.<br>
Hell I worked with a white woman who had cancer and required treatments. She only got around 25 hours a week and when she asked to have the day of her treatments worked into her schedule, the manager threatened to cut her to 10 hour a week, saying she had a business to run. I reported the manager to the district manager so she got to take her treatments with out problems. My point I guess is everyone will have to deal with an uncaring ass in the workplace from time to time, but blacks always want make it about racial discrimination.<br>

Ah, the ghetto lottery! So Mother England has acquired another habit from her colonies.</p>
<p>I have noticed that in French hotels and restaurants it is quite common for the kitchen staff or housekeeping personnel to be all black; but out in front, meeting the public, there will be a light-skinned Arab (who could pass for French).  </p>
<p>Of course, the French have a different idea  about these things and race is taboo to mention or acknowledge. I have no idea how they handle such complaints, or if they even entertain them. I imagine the Africans are just glad to have a job and haven&rsquo;t gotten to the demanding stage yet. They will, in time   &mdash;   when they learn about the ghetto lottery.  Another idea from fertile America!</p>

Britian has genetically and historically been white, therefore, you aren&rsquo;t British even if you were born there.  Besides, since when does the private sector have to do anything for you?  Why can&rsquo;t the private sector do business with whoever they damn well please?</p>

		<p>Sad for Juliette and I understand her frustration, but part of running a business that deals with the public and depends on making them feel good to get repeat business DOES include image.  One just does not associate &#8220;black&#8221; with &#8220;high class hotel&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure an extremely ugly or facially deformed white person wouldn&rsquo;t get the job either.</p>
<p>If she wins her case, it will limit opportunities for blacks further as the hotel won&rsquo;t employ ANY blacks in positions that have potential for promotion to front of house position.</p>
<p>What next, eighty year old grannies suing because they can&rsquo;t get jobs as poledancing strippers?</p>

		<p>This is a business decision. It may be that the hotel would lose business if contact people that deal with customers present a certain look. If the management prefers attractive female employees with social skills to greet the guests, will they soon be sued for not promoting surly, obese, unattractive women? I routinely bypass businesses that cater to or employ blacks. The best way to get me to leave a business establishment is having signs in english and spanish. I am amazed that something like this was allowed to go forward. Consider this. What would be the norm for print advertising. An attractive blonde or an old black woman? Maybe not the ideal of diversity, but that&rsquo;s the way it is. Maybe white women should start suing black targeted magazines for not hiring white models. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Have that potential for front of the house promotion&#8221;<br>
When I got sucked into the restraunt biz there was a moment when the minority manager told me he was going to &#8220;Promote&#8221; me from bar back to grill cook. It would also come with a $1.10 an hour raise. I told him &#8220;No Thanks&#8221;. When he demanded to know the reason for my refusal, I held my arms up like Lady Justice weighing her scales.<br>
&#8220;Let`s see&#8221; I said. &#8220;Sweat, raw meat, grease and second degree burns&hellip;or Tips, girls, colored lights and cognac!&#8221; Six months later he was gone and I was dating a Pharmiscist I had met during Happy Hour&hellip; I consider it one of the defining moments of my life. Learning how to say no to a raw deal, not in my best interest.</p>

Too bad!   I have been a US citizen all my life.  Yet, when the police ask to see my ID, I show them my ID and comply.  I don&rsquo;t argue about it, or file a discrimination complaint.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting to the point where EVERYONE will have to be promoted equally, on a rigid basis of seniority, regardless of job performance, attendance, or abilities. Management will be in for a lawsuit if they don&rsquo;t.   Anything else will be considered &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. At least where racial &#8220;minorities&#8221; are involved.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;I also had a number of bereavements in my family between 2006 and 2008 but received little sympathy from work.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Some/many of these people have unrealistic expectations of an employer.   Many expect the job to provide a family situation and a home away from home. They expect you to hold their hand and counsel them through their personal problems.  I had one woman break down and sob hysterically because no one had bought her a birthday cake!  She was bitterly offended because no one had thought to remember her birthday.  (Since when is it the company&rsquo;s business to buy you a birthday cake?  Some people think it is!)</p>
<p>With more and more blacks in the workplace, these childish demands/expectations are becoming more common than ever.</p>

		<p>I know there will be a lot of scoffing, but I used to work in the hotel industry. The industry has racial favorites, the favorites being whites and oriental asians, the disfavored being blacks an sub-continentals, like Indians and the like. The reasons being that blacks and Indians are thought to have a low standard of service. </p>
